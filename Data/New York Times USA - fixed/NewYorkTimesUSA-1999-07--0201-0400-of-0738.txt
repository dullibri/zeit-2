HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS;
China WinsJapan Backing To Join World Trade Group

BYLINE: By SETH FAISON 

DATELINE: BEIJING, July 9

 BODY:
Prime Minister Zhu Rongji of China and Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi of Japan met here today and announced that they had reached a trade agreement that effectively won Japan's endorsement for China to join the World Trade Organization.
The deal covered minor trade issues but carried weighty implications. China is eager to join the group that makes the rules of global commerce, and has sought support from many of its 134 members. At the same time, its negotiations with Washington -- essentially the arbiter of China's efforts to join the trade group -- remains at an impasse. 
 Today's agreement is unlikely to have a direct impact on China's negotiations with the United States, which stalled after NATO's bombing of the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade in May prompted a diplomatic crisis.
Yet one potent hint emerged today, sure to attract the attention of American officials scouring China's political landscape for clues over how to break the stalemate. It was the comment, which a senior Japanese official attributed to Mr. Zhu, that China would not withdraw the concessions offered to the United States when Mr. Zhu visited in April.
China's official accounts of the meeting did not confirm the remark, so American negotiators are unlikely to be able to test Mr. Zhu's sincerity until they actually sit down again with Chinese counterparts.
But the United States was clearly irked by the Japan-China agreement. In the view of American officials, Japan makes few demands of China -- knowing that whatever concessions the United States wins will also apply to China's other trading partners. In other words, Japan can win diplomatic points with China without losing any trade advantages.
"By and large, the Japanese have not contributed sufficiently to the creation of a commercially meaningful agreement," Charlene Barshefsky, the United States trade representative, said today in Washington.
American officials have said the key to resolving remaining differences is whether Beijing will keep the concessions Mr. Zhu had offered.
Mr. Zhu and his colleagues were surprised and angered when American trade officials publicized the concessions that China had made privately in Washington. But they apparently felt doubly betrayed when President Clinton vetoed a deal negotiators were almost ready to sign.
After all that, persuading Chinese negotiators not to rescind any of their concessions was going to be a challenge, United States officials admitted. After the bombing, efforts to negotiate fell apart entirely.
Today, Mr. Zhu kept to the position that Beijing will not resume talks with the United States until it gets a better explanation for the embassy bombing. NATO has said it was a mistake that followed a series of intelligence and planning failures, an explanation Chinese leaders have rejected as implausible.
Mr. Zhu, vulnerable to accusations that he gave away too much during his visit to the United States, is believed to have fended off internal attacks on his position favoring membership. But if months go by without further talks with the United States, it may damage his authority.
The working deadline for an agreement is Nov. 30, when a new round of global trade talks begins in Seattle. If no agreement is reached by then, China's efforts to join the world trade body may be delayed for several years.
Mr. Obuchi, apparently looking for a diplomatic achievement to crown his visit, expressed the desire that Japan's agreement would affect China's talks with the United States.
"We hope that the bilateral settlement will lead to an impetus for new China-U.S. talks," Mr. Obuchi said tonight after a two-day visit here. "It is our desire to see China enter the W.T.O. by the end of the year."
Japan's agreement with China today covered the services sector, including telecommunications, construction, distribution and financial services. The deal, Japanese officials said, complements a 1997 agreement on commodities trade between the two biggest trading partners in Asia.
Jun Yokota, Deputy Director General for economic affairs in Japan's Foreign Ministry, said China had asked to keep the contents of the deal secret, and that Japan had agreed.

HEADLINE: MANEUVERS SHOW RUSSIAN RELIANCE ON NUCLEAR ARMS

BYLINE: By MICHAEL R. GORDON 

DATELINE: MOSCOW, July 9

 BODY:
Reflecting its growing dependence on nuclear weapons for defense, Russia's military carried out mock nuclear strikes in a major exercise last month, the Defense Minister said today.
The exercise was the largest since the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991. It involved 50,000 troops, bombers, tanks and warships from the Barents Sea to the Black Sea. 
 One of the scenarios for the exercise underscored the expanding role nuclear weapons have been playing in the Russian military's strategy and plans in recent years.
According to the script for the military exercise, disclosed today at a news conference by Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev, Russia came under attack by an unspecified Western foe, which used non-nuclear forces.
At first, Russia also tried to limit its attacks to conventional forces. But its cash-starved non-nuclear forces failed to stop the enemy onslaught, forcing the leadership to turn to its still formidable nuclear arsenal.
"The exercise tested one of the provisions of Russia's military doctrine concerning a possible use of nuclear weapons when all other measures are exhausted," Marshal Sergeyev said. "We did pursue such an option. All measures were exhausted. Our defenses proved to be ineffective. An enemy continued to push into Russia. And that's when the decision to use nuclear weapons was made."
During Soviet times, Moscow and Washington piled up huge nuclear arsenals as they sought to best each other in the arms race.
Still, Russia's conventional forces were enormous. In those years it was NATO, fearing that it was outnumbered, that openly threatened to initiate the use of nuclear weapons in response to a non-nuclear attack.
Now that the Soviet Union has collapsed, however, the tables have turned. The West has become less dependent on nuclear weapons. As the conflict with Yugoslavia showed, NATO fights its wars with with laser-guided and satellite-guided non-nuclear bombs and missiles.
But with Russia's military spending projected this year at about $4 billion (compared with about $260 billion for the Pentagon), the once-mighty conventional forces have deteriorated.
Russia's forces failed to defeat Chechnya's rebels, and Russian generals are no longer confident that they can prevail over more serious threats. And with a faltering economy, nuclear forces are virtually the only way Russia can lay claim to being a world power.
"Russia's military believes that it must rely more than ever on the first use of nuclear weapons," said Bruce Blair, a specialist on Russian nuclear capabilities at the Brookings Institution. "It is part psychological and partly a planning assumption."
The first sign of Russia's increasing dependence on nuclear weapons came in 1993 when the Defense Ministry abandoned the Soviet-era pledge not to be the first to use nuclear weapons.
Then, as NATO's bombing of Yugoslavia reinforced the sense here that the West has a huge lead in conventional military technology, President Boris N. Yeltsin met with his top national security advisers to discuss plans to compensate for Russia's faltering conventional capabilities by developing short-range, tactical nuclear weapons.
The projects and plans that were approved remain secret. But Vladim Putin, the secretary of the Security Council, said Mr. Yeltsin had approved a "blueprint for the development and use of non-strategic nuclear weapons."
None of this means that NATO and Russia are necessarily on a collision course. The Yeltsin Government has pledged to cooperate on arms control, including seeking Parliament's approval of the Start-2 treaty reducing strategic nuclear arms.
And on Thursday, Mr. Yeltsin enjoined a group of Russian generals to cooperate with NATO in enforcing the peace in Kosovo.
"The problem of our relations with NATO and the U.S.A. is very subtle, delicate and difficult," Mr. Yeltsin said. "Every one of you must pursue the same line -- the President's line. We shall certainly not quarrel with NATO outright, but nor do we intend to flirt with it."
Russia's recent exercise, however, demonstrated the competitive nature of the relationship. The weeklong exercise, which was held in late June, was planned last year but adapted to take account of the Yugoslav conflict, including NATO's ability to attack at long range with precision-guided bombs, Marshal Sergeyev said.
The military aim of the exercise was to test command procedures for defending western Russia and Belarus from an attack from the West.
"To verify the authenticity of the decisions and test procedures for troop control, more than 50 military units participated in the exercise," Marshal Sergeyev said. "There have been extensive structural changes to the forces in recent years, and we have to practice their management and regain units' operational skills."
The political aim appeared to be to demonstrate to the world as well as to the Russian public that the military is still a credible fighting force.
During the exercise, two old turbo-prop Bear bombers approached Iceland while a couple of new Blackjack bombers approached Norway. Russian ships maneuvered under the watchful eyes of Western reconnaissance ships and aircraft.
Officially, the Defense Ministry declined to specify who the imaginary enemy was. The aim, Marshal Sergeyev told the Russian Itar-Tass news agency, was to rehearse the defeat of the enemy and the recapture of lost territory.
Some Russian observers were less diplomatic. The Defense Ministry, the newspaper Nezavisimaya Gazeta noted, refuses to say who the adversary is. "But few doubt that the enemy is NATO's armed forces in Europe," it added.

HEADLINE: Uproar Against Navy War Games Unites Puerto Ricans

BYLINE: By MIREYA NAVARRO 

DATELINE: VIEQUES, P.R., July 4

 BODY:
For two months now, about three dozen people have occupied the eastern tip of this small island seven miles off Puerto Rico, trespassing on property controlled by the United States Navy in an act of deliberate defiance.
They have set up tents, built a chapel and walked among craters, target boards and unexploded bombs at the Navy's live-fire range, vowing not to leave until the military training exercises there are stopped. 
 "We're fighting for the future of a new generation," said Carlos Zenon, a 62-year-old fisherman whose group is one of four occupying the Navy property.
The Navy has used Vieques for target practice since 1941, but the Navy's presence is under investigation by a special Federal panel and is fueling an unprecedented uproar in Puerto Rico, uniting political parties and environmental and religious groups after a civilian security guard was killed and four others were injured in April when an F/A-18 jet dropped two bombs a mile and a half from its intended target.
For the first time since its acquisition by the United States after the Spanish-American War, Puerto Rico, a self-governing commonwealth and an American military outpost in the Caribbean, is demanding that the Navy end all military activities in Vieques and return the land it acquired in the 1940's. Last week a special commission appointed by Gov. Pedro J. Rossello concluded that the military training had caused disastrous economic and environmental damage and that it violated the human and constitutional rights of the 9,300 residents of Vieques. The panel recommended that the Navy clean up and leave.
"This is not an expression of Puerto Ricans' unwillingness to serve or contribute to the defense of the nation," Governor Rossello said. "This is specifically about irreversible and significant damage to a community of United States citizens."
The April accident underscored the problems facing Vieques, a 51-square-mile island -- not quite twice the size of Manhattan -- whose towns are as close as nine miles to the live-impact range used by the Navy about 180 days of the year. For years, opponents of the training exercises have blamed the explosions not only for rattling windows and making residents anxious about their safety, but also for stifling Vieques's fledging tourism, hurting the livelihood of fishermen and leaving the small island behind the rest of Puerto Rico in income, employment and quality of life.
The security guard killed in the April accident, 35-year-old David Sanes, was the first civilian casualty since the training exercises began, but Puerto Rico officials say there have been close calls over the years.
Last February, Navy pilots at the range accidentally fired 263 shells tipped with depleted uranium -- a dense material used to penetrate thick armor -- and although Nuclear Regulatory Commission officials say the radioactivity from the uranium is very low, the news increased health concerns here among people already reeling from unexplained high rates of cancer.
"Nobody would allow this in the United States," said Ruben Reyes, a 34-year-old agronomist who lives here with his wife and 18-month-old son. "I don't have a problem with the Navy, but it seems illogical to me that they conduct exercises so close to citizens. To them we're cockroaches."
Navy officials say their practices have been conducted under strict regulations to insure safety and the preservation of the environment. The Navy is conducting its own investigation of the April accident and has suspended maneuvers in Vieques. President Clinton has appointed a Federal panel to study the Navy's need for operations here and possible alternatives. The panel's report is expected by August.
Meanwhile, exercises continue in the Caribbean, 50 miles away, by a battle group of 10,000 troops, two submarines, a dozen destroyers and frigates and more than 20 F/A-18's and other attack planes led by the aircraft carrier John F. Kennedy. Last week they conducted air defense exercises on the high seas, simulating a conflict in the Persian Gulf, spotting unidentified aircraft and shooting at imaginary enemies.
But to fully prepare for war, Navy officials on the Kennedy said, they need Vieques, the only place where they can count on nearly 200,000 square miles of uncongested air and sea space and some land for target and amphibious assault practice, allowing all battle components to come together in a realistic scenario.
Vieques also offers a sophisticated infrastructure worth billions of dollars, the officials said, including an underwater training range between Vieques and the United States Virgin Islands of St. Croix and St. Thomas for submarines. A Navy spokesman said it would be unlikely that kind of money would be forthcoming to replicate Vieques somewhere else.
"If the Navy lost Vieques, carrier battle groups would deploy with substandard training," said Capt. James K. Stark Jr., commanding officer at the Roosevelt Roads Naval Station in Ceiba, P.R., to which the Navy range here belongs.
Vieques is the biggest training range for the Atlantic Fleet and has provided training for the United States and its allies since World War II.
Officials say there are a dozen other Navy live-fire ranges -- two in Florida serve the Atlantic fleet, 10 in Nevada, Washington, Alaska, California, Arizona and Hawaii serve the Pacific fleet -- and that some were as close to population centers as the Vieques range. But only here does the Navy conduct large-scale exercises involving all Navy war resources, and only here has the Navy's presence been entangled with the politics of an American commonwealth where a small segment of its 3.8 million residents want independence and consider the military a symbol of colonialism.
The Navy acquired 26,000 acres here for $1.6 million and began training in Vieques and a smaller island, Culebra, in the early 1940's, when Puerto Rico's governors were appointed by Washington and before the autonomous commonwealth status was granted by the United States in 1952.
The Navy acquired three-fourths of Vieques, squeezing its then 10,000 residents between restricted Federal property that includes the 800-acre live-impact area at the eastern tip of the island and an ammunition storage area at the western end.
Over the years, the Navy training has ignited protests, blockades by fishing boats, brawls between off-duty sailors and local residents, and a Federal lawsuit by the Governor of Puerto Rico in 1978 asserting that the shells and bombs were endangering Vieques's residents and destroying coral reefs, sandbars, wildlife and other natural resources. (Similar protests had led the Navy to stop exercises in Culebra in 1975.)
The lawsuit led to a memorandum of understanding between the Puerto Rican government and the Navy in 1983 that committed the Navy to promote economic development in Vieques and undertake conservation measures to protect endangered species like sea turtles and the brown pelican. But 16 years later, Governor Rossello's commission found that little of what the memorandum called for had been achieved and that the Navy's presence had hampered economic growth.
The small island lags behind the rest of Puerto Rico, with 73 percent of its population living in poverty, compared with 58 percent in the rest of the commonwealth.
But Vieques attracts about 4,000 tourists a year, drawn to its pristine beaches, bioluminescent bays and slow pace.
For now, Puerto Rican and white flags for peace flutter from car antennas all over Vieques. Signs reading "Navy Out of Vieques" have sprung up on streets. Navy officials have restricted the movement of its uniformed personnel outside their property. And to avoid a confrontation, they said, they have not arrested any of the trespassing protesters.
Mr. Sanes's death led Puerto Rico's three political parties to come together against the Navy's presence here in a rare display of unity, joined by religious, environmental and other groups. The Puerto Rico Legislature recently allocated $100,000 for an epidemiological study into Vieques's cancer rate, which is 27 percent higher than in the rest of Puerto Rico, and the government is preparing for legal action as a last resort.
In an emotional presentation of the Governor's commission report last week, Secretary of State Norma Burgos choked back tears to apologize on behalf of the government of Puerto Rico to the residents of Vieques for the years of neglect.
"In one way or another," Ms. Burgos said, "we've all been responsible for what's happened."

HEADLINE: The First Lady Backs Farmers On Milk Cartel

BYLINE: By ADAM NAGOURNEY 

DATELINE: SYRACUSE, July 9

 BODY:
Hillary Rodham Clinton completed her first campaign tour across New York today with an embrace of the state's dairy farmers, declaring her support for Federal legislation that would assure them higher prices but likely force up the price of milk for consumers.
Although Mrs. Clinton today again presented herself as a New Yorker-in-training, eager to be educated in a series of forums with voters in the state, she had no problem offering a position on the milk price cartel, one of the most difficult issues in New York state politics today. 
 When the director of the Oneida County Farm Bureau, Pat Van Lieshout, asked if New York should be permitted to join the two-year-old federally sanctioned cartel that sets a minimum price for milk paid to its member farmers, the First Lady instantly answered yes, in a clear sign of the preparation she has done for her possible Senate campaign.
In declaring her position, Mrs. Clinton appeared to put herself at odds with Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, her likely Republican opponent in next year's Senate race, who has sought to prevent New York's inclusion in the Northeast Interstate Dairy Compact. And she risked alienating downstate voters more concerned with supermarket prices than the plight of farmers. She also, for the third time in two weeks, appeared to deviate from a policy promoted by her husband's Administration, in this case, the Department of Agriculture.
"Let me say that I support the dairy compact," Mrs. Clinton said at a forum in Utica this morning. "And I support the inclusion of New York, Pennsylvania, and I think it's, from what I know now, a very important step for the dairy farmers, and, I would argue, over the long run for the entire population to have more price stability and more fair returns on investments.
"I don't think anyone works harder than dairy farmers," Mrs. Clinton added. "Dairy farmers are on call basically 24 hours a day."
Mrs. Clinton disclosed her position at the fourth of her "Listening to New Yorkers" sessions, the centerpiece of this campaignlike swing, in which groups of people have been invited to sit down with Mrs. Clinton in orchestrated discussions.
Today Mrs. Clinton continued to go to considerable lengths to present herself as a political ingenue, as she invited lessons from health care workers, teachers, nursing home residents, farmers and, at an auto plant here this afternoon, factory workers.
"Thank you for explaining this to me!" she told a farmer in Utica this morning.
"That's a great idea!" she told a job trainer here in Syracuse.
Nonetheless, her willingness to engage in a spontaneous exchange with a dairy farmer on the compact issue suggested more depth to Mrs. Clinton's knowledge about New York State than might otherwise be suggested by the forums she has organized.
It also was one more sign of her evolution into a full-fledged New York political candidate. Throughout this week, Mrs. Clinton -- or Hillary, as she was addressed more than once by New York voters -- offered clear hints that she had done her New York homework, whether it was in addressing New York reporters by their first names or mentioning obscure statistics about the state. At one point today she said, "If upstate New York were a separate state, it would rank 49th in job creation, compared to all of the other states in the entire country."
Mrs. Clinton had originally considered staying in New York for more events in Albany on Saturday, but now plans to return to Washington on Saturday morning. She is to return to New York on Monday, for three or four days of visits in the New York suburbs, the part of the state where the Senate election could well end up being determined.
The Northeast compact is scheduled to expire on Oct. 1. The legislation before Congress would renew it and enable New York, New Jersey, Delaware, Maryland and Pennsylvania to join the cartel.
The dairy compact issue is one that has long roiled this economically depressed part of New York. It has tended to divide politicians more by region than by party; both of New York's Democratic Senators, Daniel Patrick Moynihan and Charles E. Schumer, support allowing the state to enter the organization.
But many downstate leaders, from Mr. Giuliani to Mark Green, the New York Public Advocate, have argued against it, warning that it could raise the cost of a gallon of milk in New York City from about $2.75 to $3.25.
The issue is potentially troublesome for Mr. Giuliani because it sets up a potential conflict between the constituency he now represents in City Hall and the voters he will need to appeal to assuming he runs for office next year. New York, with 8,300 dairy farmers, is the nation's third-largest milk producer. Mr. Giuliani's office did not return repeated telephone calls yesterday seeking comment on the Mayor's current position on the matter. A spokesman for the Department of Agriculture, Andrew Solomon, said the Clinton Administration did not share Mrs. Clinton's advocacy of the subject. "It's something that we've left to Congress and the states," he said. "We have essentially taken a hands-off approach."
Still, Mr. Solomon said, the Department of Agriculture is preparing its own plan to set milk prices that will take effect in October, assuming that it is not overruled by Congress and it is approved in votes by regional dairy producers. That plan would supersede the compact, Mr. Solomon said. Northeast dairy farmers have generally opposed the Agriculture Department's plan, arguing that it would be less generous than the current compact.
Mr. Van Lieshout, who is both a dairy farmer and head of the Oneida County Farm Bureau, said he was pleased by Mrs. Clinton's response to his question. "I was glad to hear that she was supportive of the diary compact," he said. Then, in a nod to the reality of politics in that part of the state, he added: "I somewhat expected that."

HEADLINE: SLIDE IN CURRENCY IS CHILLING EUROPE

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS 

DATELINE: FRANKFURT, July 9

 BODY:
It was supposed to be a symbol of new strength and unity, a sign that Europe had finally achieved economic parity with the United States.
But today, little more than six months after 11 European nations adopted the euro as a new single currency, it has become a source of embarrassment and anxiety. 
 In a slide that has alarmed many government officials and surprised economists, the euro has steadily declined against the dollar from nearly $1.18 at its introduction on Jan. 4 to just below $1.02 by the end of today.
Despite continuous exhortations by European central bankers about the euro's fundamental value, it now has a good chance of dropping below the value of a dollar.
The relentless decline has become a mirror of Europe's economic weakness and political disunity. It also is a daily reminder of the contrasting economic boom still under way in the United States.
For Americans, the euro's decline is good news. Europe has become a far more affordable place to visit -- prices in dollars have fallen nearly 15 percent since January because of exchange rates alone. And European imports are a bit cheaper.
But for Europeans, the euro's weakness is beginning to pinch financially. Worried that the euro could fall even more, global investors have in recent days begun demanding a risk premium -- slightly higher interest rates -- when buying euro-denominated bonds.
In effect, that means the cost of borrowing for corporations as well as for people buying homes and cars is edging upward.
Doubts about the euro have intensified before it has even become a full-fledged currency. It is still used only in corporate and government financial transactions -- euro notes and coins will not enter circulation until 2002. But the national currencies of the 11 euro countries are locked into the value of the euro, rising and falling with it.
To be sure, there is nothing magical or even good about a particular exchange rate. The dollar has itself fluctuated widely over the years in relation to other currencies.
A weak euro also has practical advantages for Europeans. It promotes European exports by making them cheaper in dollar terms. It creates opportunities for foreign investors looking at European properties.
Many experts believe that the euro will climb again in the months ahead. Economic growth is picking up again and inflation is still negligible, trends that should tend to strengthen the euro. The currency also should gain from Europe's big trade surplus, which increases demand for euros and raises their value as European exporters repatriate profits from healthy sales overseas.
But by all accounts, the euro's decline reflects Europe's disappointing economic performance. Growth is running at an annualized rate of about 2 percent in 1999 compared with more than 3 percent for the United States.
Germany, which accounts for a third of the economic output of the 11-nation euro zone, slumped badly after the Russian financial collapse last summer and is only beginning to bounce back. Italy, the euro zone's third-largest economy after Germany and France, stalled as well.
But the euro has been wounded by political uncertainties, too. Even as European leaders toasted its introduction on New Year's Eve, left-of-center leaders in countries like France and Germany were balking at the inflation-fighting priorities of the new European Central Bank.
Germany's new Social Democratic Government under Chancellor Gerhard Schroder added to the problems. Mr. Schroder's first Finance Minister, Oskar Lafontaine, unnerved investors by loudly badgering the European Central Bank to lower interest rates, which would promote more economic growth but make the euro worth less. He also infuriated industry leaders with plans that would have raised taxes for many companies and added to regulation.
Mr. Lafontaine abruptly resigned in March, and Mr. Schroder has veered back toward the political center. But Mr. Schroder's shaky stewardship rattled business confidence, which is only now starting to revive.
Political miscues elsewhere in Europe have hurt the euro as well. Last month the currency tumbled on a suggestion by Romano Prodi, the former Prime Minister of Italy who has since become the European Commission President, that Italy might eventually have to quit Europe's single currency. Although Mr. Prodi said his remarks were taken out of context, it was the first time a senior official had even hinted at the possibility of a breakup.
Mr. Prodi contributed to the euro's weakness on Thursday, saying he was not worried about its decline. Germany's new Finance Minister, Hans Eichel, went even further. He said on the same day that the weak euro was "good for exports" and "no problem."
Oddly, the euro's newest low point comes as signs of economic strength are becoming more numerous. Industrial orders are up in Germany. Business confidence has climbed significantly in France. Italy, which retreated from its earlier deficit-reduction goals last month, is tightening up again.
But confidence in the euro has not recovered.
"Credibility is very easy to lose and very hard to regain," said Thomas Mayer, a senior economist at Goldman, Sachs in Frankfurt. "Right now, there seems to be a very negative feeling in the market that is very hard to counter. What we really need is a significant change in perception, and it is not clear at this stage what would bring this about."
Almost daily the last several months, European central bankers have earnestly tried to talk up the euro as if they were members of a booster club.
But the bankers have often seemed torn between their laissez-faire principles and their discomfort at the euro's decline.
Wim Duisenberg, the Dutch president of the European Central Bank, caused a furor among many of his colleagues in April when he described the bank's approach to exchange rates as one of "benign neglect."
The comment prompted Hans Tietmeyer, president of Germany's central bank, to publicly dispute the idea of neglect and to complain that "a significant further change of the euro's level would not be appropriate."
But the central bankers also appear convinced that if they intervened in the foreign exchange market, buying euros and selling dollars to strengthen the euro's value, they would simply undermine the currency's credibility.
Instead, they have offered new pep talks every time the euro slips a bit more.
"The euro is a currency firmly based on internal price stability and therefore has a clear potential for a stronger external value," said Jean-Claude Trichet, president of the National Bank of France, at a conference on Wednesday in Hong Kong.
Some experts agree.
"One should not overplay the current fears," said Daniel Gros, deputy director of the Center for European Policy Studies, a research center in Brussels. "The economic outlook for Europe in the medium term has improved considerably. The business cycle looking forward does not support a euro at this level."
But even Mr. Gros acknowledged that he was surprised by the euro's decline. Investors behaved much differently toward the euro than he and many other experts had expected.
Six months ago, many economists and investment analysts predicted that foreign financial institutions, including central banks, would start selling dollars and buying euros.
But that did not happen. Rattled by problems ranging from Russia's collapse to the looming war in Yugoslavia, investors treated the dollar as even more of a haven than they had before.
The most recent pressure on the euro has come from diverging interest rate policy between Europe and the United States. In a significant move to stimulate growth, the European Central Bank reduced its core interest rate from 3 percent, to 2.5 percent, in April. That made borrowing more affordable for Europeans, but it also undermined the euro's value by putting more of the currency in circulation.
Then on June 30, the Federal Reserve moved in the opposite direction. Worried that the American economy could overheat, it increased its central short-term interest rate from 4.75 percent, to 5 percent. That pushed up the dollar at a time when the euro was already weakening.
In a survey of European economists, Reuters reported on Thursday that 66 percent now expect the euro to reach parity with the dollar and some believe it will drop even lower.
Indeed, many European experts are convinced that government leaders quietly support the idea.
"The fall of the euro in the last six months does not mean that the euro lacks credibility," said Dominique Moisi, deputy director of the French Institute for International Relations in Paris. "It simply means that various European governments have found it very comfortable."
Recent statistics suggest that the weakened euro has already begun to stimulate new exports and growth in Germany, where growth stagnated at the end of last year.
But the weak euro now seems to be pushing up bond rates, which means that borrowing money is becoming costlier. The difference between yields on 10-year German bonds, which had been 1.7 percentage points lower than comparable United States Treasury bills, has narrowed by nearly a third in the last three weeks.
Mr. Mayer of Goldman, Sachs said the shift reflected a new risk premium that investors in euro-denominated bonds were demanding as protection against further declines in the euro's value.
"Until now, people could say that the decline of the euro didn't cause any real problems," Mr. Mayer said. "This is a clear warning sign that something unpleasant is taking place."

The euro, the currency for 11 European nations, was supposed to be a cornerstone of a new economic power. But since it began trading this year, the weakness of many of its member economies, coupled with the war in the Balkans and continued United States economic strength, have undermined the currency.

THAILAND CUTS BANK RATE

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
Thailand's central bank cut its official bank rate for the second time in two weeks to a record low, aiming to revitalize the nation's economic recovery by lowering borrowing costs. The benchmark rate was cut 1.5 percentage points, to 4 percent, effective immediately. The bank made a similar reduction on June 25. The rate, the Thai equivalent of the United States Federal Reserve discount window rate, was previously lowered in February. Before that, the central bank had not reduced the discount rate since August 1993. http://www.nytimes.com

DROP IN CANADIAN UNEMPLOYMENT

BYLINE: By Anthony DePalma 

 BODY:
Unemployment in Canada hit a nine-year low in June, dropping half a percentage point from the previous month, though few additional jobs were created. While still substantially higher than the rate in the United States, unemployment in Canada has dropped to 7.6 percent, the lowest level since June 1990. But Statistics Canada said the half-point decrease was primarily caused by a decline in the number of people registered as actively seeking work rather than by job growth, which has been disappointing.

Tribe Uneasy at Change In Rules for Developers

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: NORWICH

 BODY:
Mohegan officials said yesterday that their tribe was concerned about the state's suspension of the process for deciding who will develop 470 acres of state-owned land in Norwich and Preston.
The American Indian tribe has been one of four top contenders for developing the site. There have been reports that Pfizer Inc. is also interested. 
 "We're slightly taken aback," Chuck Bunnell, deputy chief of staff for the tribe, said yesterday. "We were surprised by the action."
The tribe, which runs the Mohegan Sun casino across the Thames River, has said it wants to build an 18-hole championship golf course bordered by a marina, stores and housing.
The selection process, which has been handled by an advisory committee of state and local officials, was suspended Thursday by that group to let state economic development officials hold discussions with "a number" of the applicants.
The state's Department of Economic and Community Development will sift through the plans, determine their viability and negotiate any financial incentives with the developers, said Rita Zangari, the department's Deputy Commissioner.
"We may see one proposal as being better than another, and we will give the committee that information," Ms. Zangari said.
Pfizer officials have refused to publicly confirm whether they are interested in the site.
Spaulding & Slye, a Boston-based real estate firm, has said it is negotiating on behalf of an unidentified Fortune 500 company, reported to be Pfizer. It has submitted a proposal to build a $1 billion corporate office and research park.
In addition to the Mohegan and Spaulding bids, the Starrett Corporation of New York wants to build affordable housing with a hotel, resort and retirement community. And the Greenwich-based Conroy Development Company is proposing a golf course and mixed-use community combining office space, residential apartments and a town center.
Norwich and Preston officials said they favored the Fortune 500 plan over others because it would provide high-paying jobs and diversify the regional economy, which has shifted significantly toward gambling, entertainment and tourism.

To the Editor:
Many workers may be earning more than they did last month and even last year (Business Day, July 3), but most are likely to be earning less than their fathers did at their age. 
 According to our recent study, in 1997 Ohio's black and white workers of every age group except ages 46 to 55 earned between 11 percent and 35 percent less in real wages at the median than workers of the same age and race earned in 1979. The results are the same when separated by education, race or earnings level.
Only white women saw modest (2.4 percent) real wage boosts at the median during this period. Similar results have been documented for the country as a whole. Understanding the economy requires comparison not only with the last year but also with the last generation.

HEADLINE: Tribal Colleges Need More Federal Money

 BODY:

To the Editor:
President Clinton's focus on American Indians (news article, July 8) should encompass the policy and financing of American Indian education. With almost 40 percent of the American Indian population under the age of 20, the tribal colleges and universities must play a critical role. They are often the only access these students have to higher education. But the tribal institutions, which also serve as economic tools for many poverty-stricken reservations, receive far less Federal money than non-Indian community colleges. 
 President Clinton is right to focus on improving the housing of American Indians and creating jobs. He must also re-evaluate educational financing.

To the Editor:
Re "Forgotten Corners of America" (editorial, July 9): I was impressed by President Clinton's visit, over several days, to some of the poorest areas of our country. Such visits are so rare, and so right. 
 There was little if any political capital to be gained from such a visit. After all, poor people vote less than others. They can't afford high-priced lobbyists in Washington. And the average American probably doesn't think about them. In short, they are a constituency most politicians don't have to pay attention to.
The message of the President's trip seemed to be that the vitality of our society depends in no small part on the vitality of all its citizens. As we head into an election year, let's hope that more politicians across the ideological spectrum embrace this message.

After years of promoting the transfer of low-skilled jobs to foreign countries, now President Clinton sees fit to promote economic recovery in the poorest areas of this country (editorial, July 9). 
 Why should an American company invest in the United States when the manufacturing can be done in other countries at one-third the cost, with the subsidy and blessing of the Government? Mr. Clinton's double-talk approach does nothing to address the greatest deterrent to manufacturing in the United States: the bureaucracy that makes manufacturing too costly and convoluted to be an efficient part of a profit-making business.

HEADLINE: James Farmer, Civil Rights Giant In the 50's and 60's, Is Dead at 79

BYLINE: By RICHARD SEVERO

 BODY:
James Farmer, a principal founder of the Congress of Racial Equality and the last survivor of the "Big Four" who shaped the civil-rights struggle in the United States in the mid-1950's and 60's, died yesterday at Mary Washington Hospital, in Fredericksburg, Va., where he lived. He was 79.
Mr. Farmer had been in failing health for years, losing his sight and both his legs to severe diabetes. 
 Mr. Farmer's main colleagues in the civil rights movement were the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, who was assassinated in 1968; Whitney Young of the Urban League, who died in 1971; and Roy Wilkins of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, who died in 1981.
Although attention in recent years has focused on Dr. King's activities, Mr. Farmer played a towering role in the movement as a direct-action leader of the organization popularly known as CORE. Claude Sitton, who covered the South for The New York Times during the civil rights struggle, observed: "CORE under Mr. Farmer often served as the razor's edge of the movement. It was to CORE that the four Greensboro, N.C., students turned after staging the first in the series of sit-ins that swept the South in 1960. It was CORE that forced the issue of desegregation in interstate transportation with the Freedom Rides of 1961. It was CORE's James Chaney, Andrew Goodman and Michael Schwerner -- a black and two whites -- who became the first fatalities of the Mississippi Freedom Summer of 1964." The three were murdered by a gang of Klansmen and buried beneath an earthen dam near the town of Philadelphia. The CORE workers were investigating a church burning and promoting black voter registration.
Mr. Farmer himself risked his life in several demonstrations. In 1963, Louisiana state troopers armed with guns, cattle prods and tear gas, hunted him door to door when he was trying to organize protests in the town of Plaquemine.
"I was meant to die that night," Mr. Farmer once said. "They were kicking open doors, beating up blacks in the streets, interrogating them with electric cattle prods." A funeral home director had Mr. Farmer "play dead" in the back of a hearse that carried him along back roads and out of town.
Mr. Farmer went to jail for "disturbing the peace" in Plaquemine, and was behind bars on Aug. 28, 1963, the day that Dr. King delivered his "I Have a Dream" speech as the climax of the March on Washington. Mr. Farmer sent his own speech to the March on Washington, which was read by Floyd McKissick, an aide in CORE. "We will not stop," Mr. Farmer wrote, "until the dogs stop biting us in the South and the rats stop biting us in the North."
At one point, a friendly F.B.I. agent told Mr. Farmer that an informant had infiltrated the Ku Klux Klan in Louisiana, and had reported that the Klan had voted to kill Mr. Farmer the next time he set foot in Bogalusa. "Tell me," Mr. Farmer said to the agent, "were there any dissenting votes?"
 
Using Nonviolence As the Weapon
 Mr. Farmer was a disciple of Mohandas Gandhi, and it was Gandhi's strategy of nonviolent direct action that was to become Mr. Farmer's weapon against discrimination. A fierce integrationist, he enlisted both whites and blacks as CORE volunteers.
Some white liberals who generally approved of what Mr. Farmer was doing frequently advised him to be more patient with a recalcitrant society dominated by whites. They thought that the doctrine of nonviolence was radical in its use of picketing and sit-ins. Some thought it engendered bellicose responses from whites that did nothing to further amicable race relations.
On one tense occasion in the early 1960's, after a particularly vicious spate of violence, Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy suggested that Mr. Farmer's followers postpone some of their Freedom Rides -- designed to desegregate the interstate bus system in the South -- so that everyone could "cool off." Mr. Farmer refused, saying, "We have been cooling off for 350 years."
As the turbulent decade of the 1960's unfolded, some blacks who despaired that they would ever have an amicable relationship with the white majority and regarded nonviolence as more of a weakness than a strength, on occasion would ask Mr. Farmer, "When are you going to fight back?" Mr. Farmer would always reply, "We are fighting back, we're only using new weapons."
"I lived in two worlds," Mr. Farmer said late in life, recalling his role in the movement. "One was the volatile and explosive one of the new black Jacobins and the other was the sophisticated and genteel one of the white and black liberal establishment. As a bridge, I was called on by each side for help in contacting the other."
Mr. Farmer, the son of a minister and the grandson of a slave, came to feel that his generation of leaders had been all but forgotten in recent years, with the exception of Dr. King because of television's use of film clips replaying his "I Have a Dream Speech."
Mr. Farmer was appalled to learn that in one survey of blacks taken in the 1990's, somebody said he thought that Dr. King's claim to fame was that he had "worked for Al Sharpton" and that many young blacks had never heard of Roy Wilkins, Whitney Young and Mr. Farmer or had only the vaguest notion of what they had stood for. And so when President Clinton awarded him a Presidential Medal of Freedom in January,1998, Mr. Farmer said he felt "vindication, an acknowledgment at long last."
Mr. Farmer was proud of his role in founding CORE and guiding it to becoming one of the most effective civil rights organizations of the 1960's. The motivation for CORE came on a bright spring afternoon in Chicago in 1942 when Mr. Farmer, then just a year out of theology school, was walking with a white friend, George Houser. The two decided to stop for coffee and doughnuts in Jack Spratt's Coffee Shop on the South Side.
The counterman made them wait even though there was almost nobody in the restaurant, then tried to charge them a dollar apiece for doughnuts that were going for a nickel. Finally he ordered them out and threw their money on the floor.
"We felt he had a problem about race," Mr. Farmer said later, recalling the incident with typical understatement. Mr. Farmer, Mr. Houser and a few others staged a successful sit-in demonstration at Jack Spratt's. It was the first direct action of an organization they formed, called at the time the Committee on Racial Equality.
Within a year, CORE had a national membership, and within a few years a roster of more than 60,000 members in more than 70 chapters, coast to coast. In its heyday in the 1960's, it claimed a membership of 82,000 in 114 local groups.
Mr. Farmer was equally proud of the work he did in 1961, when he organized the Freedom Rides in the Deep South, a perilous effort in which many black and white supporters were attacked and injured by white segregationists.
James Leonard Farmer was born on Jan. 20, 1920, in Marshall, Tex. His father was James Leonard Farmer Sr., the son of a slave, a minister-scholar who became a college professor and who delighted in teaching literature in Greek, Hebrew and Aramaic. He was believed to be the first black man from Texas ever to earn a doctorate, which he did at Boston University. Mr. Farmer's mother was the former Pearl Marion Houston, a teacher.
 
A Childhood Away From Racism
As a boy, Mr. Farmer was shielded from the worst aspects of racism. He used to say that as a "faculty brat" he spent most of his time on the campuses of black colleges in the South where racial incidents would not ordinarily happen. The houses he lived in were filled with books and the conversation frequently was about the ideas in those books, most of them about ancient cultures. They did not ordinarily speak of the bleak, segregated world that existed outside the campus.
Mr. Farmer told Gay Talese of The New York Times in 1961 that his first awareness of race came when he was 3 or 4 years old, living in Holly Springs, Miss., where his father was on the faculty of Rust College. One very hot day, young James went shopping with his mother and asked her to buy him a soft drink. His mother told him he would have to wait until they got home. He saw a white child go into a drug store, and it was not until he got home that his mother explained to him why he could not do the same thing.
"Until then, I had not realized that I was colored," Mr. Farmer said. "I had lived a sheltered life on campus. My mother fell across the bed and cried." Mr. Farmer said it did not make him bitter, but, over the years, he became "determined to do something about it."
His determination was strengthened between 1934 and 1938, when he was an undergraduate at Wiley College in Marshall, Tex. He would go to movies in Marshall, and was made to sit in the "buzzard's roost," the balcony set aside for black people. During the same period, he got a job as a caddy, but found himself segregated even in the caddy yard.
Years later, when he looked back at his youth in the South, he sometimes remembered the times when black children and white children played peacefully together. The real separation between the races came at puberty, he recalled, when white parents reinforced in their children that they were white and that blacks were something else. He recalled that when he was in his teens, the friends he had known as a little boy "would only look away" when they saw him in the street.
Mr. Farmer considered both medicine and the ministry as vocations during his undergraduate days. He discovered that he could not stand the sight of blood and so in 1938, after he completed his baccalaureate work at Wiley, he enrolled in Howard University's School of Religion. It was at Howard that he was introduced to the philosophy of Gandhi.
With his commanding frame, booming bass-baritone voice and decisive way of speaking, everyone thought he would be a fine preacher. But to the dismay of his father, Mr. Farmer decided against becoming a Methodist minister because, in those days, the Methodist church in the South was segregated. "I didn't see how I could honestly preach the Gospel of Christ in a church that practiced discrimination," he said. He was quick to assure his father that his turning away from Methodism did not represent any lessening of his belief in Jesus.
After World War II started, Mr. Farmer, a conscientious objector, served as race relations secretary for the Fellowship of Reconciliation, a pacifist organization. He subsequently also worked as an organizer in the South for the Upholsterer's International Union and later for the State, County and Municipal Employees Union.
In the late 1940's, before giving CORE his full attention, he was also a program director for the N.A.A.C.P. and wrote radio and television scripts as well as magazine articles on race relations for Crisis, Fellowship, World Frontier and the Hadassah News.
During the 1950's, he worked assiduously to bring an end to segregation in Southern schools. He planned and organized CORE projects, including a Pilgrimage of Prayer in 1959 to protest the closing of public schools in Richmond, Va., to avoid complying with the 1954 Supreme Court decision outlawing segregation in the public schools.
 
Freedom Rides Drew Assaults
Throughout the 1960's, CORE's black volunteers, under Mr. Farmer's personal direction, stood peacefully in lines all over the South, insisting on the right to enter theaters, coffee shops, swimming pools, bowling alleys and other segregated public places from which they had always been barred.
Mr. Farmer did not become the $11,500-a-year salaried national director of CORE until February 1961, just before he initiated his first Freedom Ride. His father, by then retired and living in Washington, died just as Mr. Farmer was getting this effort started.
CORE and another civil rights group, the Fellowship of Reconciliation, held a Freedom Ride in 1947. A year earlier, the United States Supreme Court had ruled that segregated seating of interstate bus passengers was unconstitutional, but the ruling was virtually ignored in the South. An integrated group was sent to call attention to that injustice. Some were arrested and served on a chain gang in North Carolina.
In 1961, CORE decided to try again. Its bus riders were assaulted when using restrooms and lunchrooms in terminals in Virginia and the Carolinas.
In Alabama, their bus was firebombed in the town of Anniston and the riders stoned. In Birmingham, a mob attacked the riders and one of them, William Barbee, was paralyzed for life. They were savagely beaten again in Montgomery.
Everyone expected more violence when a small band of young blacks and whites from CORE and the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee boarded buses for the last leg of the Freedom Ride, from Montgomery to Jackson, Miss. Dr. King, on probation for his arrest during sit-ins in Atlanta, decided not to go and was criticized for his decision. When a follower asked Mr. Farmer if he was going, Mr. Farmer climbed aboard the bus though quaking with fear. But the journey was completed without further violence because of a deal worked out between Attorney General Kennedy and James O. Eastland, the segregationist Senator from Mississippi. But Mr. Farmer was arrested in Jackson for disturbing the peace and spent 40 days in Mississippi jails.
If the Freedom Rides stiffened opposition to desegregation in some quarters in the South, the courage of Mr. Farmer's CORE volunteers captured the imagination of blacks throughout the country, who decided to join the civil rights struggle. It also aroused the conscience of many whites both in America and abroad.
"In the end, it was a success," Mr. Farmer said of the Freedom Rides, "because Bobby Kennedy had the Interstate Commerce Commission issue an order, with teeth in it, that he could enforce, banning segregation in interstate travel. That was my proudest achievement."
Subsequently, Mr. Farmer turned his attention to the lack of employment opportunities for blacks. He sought no quotas because he said he was convinced that if blacks were giving an fair chance they would do just fine, but he made it clear that he wanted to see some black faces at construction sites, especially those financed with public money. He ordered sit-ins in the early 1960's at the New York offices of Mayor Robert F. Wagner and Gov. Nelson A. Rockefeller. He also organized picketing at White Castle hamburger stands in New York City, accusing the chain of refusing to hire black workers.
"We are not pressing toward the brink of violence, but for the peak of freedom," he said.
Mr. Farmer kept CORE focused on integration. When, in 1965, CORE officials called for a pullout of American troops from Vietnam, Mr. Farmer insisted that the organization reverse itself. He did not approve of the war, but thought that CORE should not express itself on American foreign policy.
He resigned his CORE director's job the same year to head what he hoped would be an intensive literacy project financed by the Administration of Lyndon B. Johnson. The project failed to materialize, and there was an open break between Mr. Farmer and R. Sargent Shriver, the director of the Federal antipoverty agency, the Office of Economic Opportunity.
Mr. Farmer did several things in the late 1960's. He taught at Lincoln University, a black institution in Oxford, Pa., about 45 miles southwest of Philadelphia, advised the State of New Jersey on problems of illiteracy, and, in 1968, ran for Congress. A Liberal candidate, backed by Republicans, in Brooklyn's 12th Congressional District, he lost to the Democrat, Shirley Chisholm. Also in 1968, he supported the re-election of Senator Jacob K. Javits, a liberal Republican, who was jeered at a campaign rally in Bedford-Stuyvesant. "Jake Javits may be white on the outside but he's black on the inside," Mr. Farmer said, calming the crowd. That same year he backed Vice President Hubert H. Humphrey in his run for the Presidency.
It had always been Mr. Farmer's position that blacks, no matter how they felt, should be a part of government, and so he readily accepted an invitation from President Richard M. Nixon in 1969 to become an Assistant Secretary in the Department of Health, Education and Welfare. Mr. Farmer was immediately attacked by some militant civil rights advocates, who wanted nothing to do with Nixon. But Roger Wilkins and Whitney Young refrained from criticizing Mr. Farmer because they agreed with him that blacks needed such involvement if they were ever to have anything to say about shaping national policy on race.
At first, Mr. Farmer defended Nixon's racial policies, but in 1970 he quit his post, complaining that the Washington bureaucracy moved too slowly and saying that he felt he was more effective outside it. Somewhat later, he complained that Nixon had virtually no contact with blacks and instead relied on Leonard Garment, a white aide, to explain black problems to him.
In 1975, Mr. Farmer broke with CORE over what he regarded as CORE's excessively pro-leftist position that sided with the Marxist faction in Angola's civil war. He resigned from the group he had founded the next year. In 1978, he lent his name to a lawsuit that attempted to unseat CORE's director, Roy Innis.
In the mid-1980's, Mr. Farmer worked hard on his memoir, "Lay Bare the Heart," which was published in 1985. Claude Sitton, reviewing the book approvingly for The New York Times, said that Mr. Farmer, "more than any other civil rights leader, fought against (racism) and attempted to hold the movement true to its purpose."
Among Mr. Farmer's other writings was "Freedom -- When?" a book published in 1966. Before his health failed he taught for several years at Mary Washington College in Fredericksburg.
Mr. Farmer's brief first marriage ended in divorce. He married Lula A. Peterson, whom he met in 1949 when she was a graduate student in economics at Northwestern University and a member of the CORE chapter in Evanston, Ill. She died in 1977.
They had two daughters, Tami and Abbey.
In his last years, Mr. Farmer lived alone in a remote house near Fredericksburg, confined to a wheelchair and often in need of an oxygen tent. When visitors came, he would joke about the times he had come close to death. Asked by a friend if he had ever seen a tunnel. Mr. Farmer acknowledged that he had, but instead of seeing St. Peter at the end of it, he saw the Devil, who said not to let Mr. Farmer in: "He'll organize a resistance movement and try to put out my fire.' "

CORRECTION-DATE: July 21, 1999, Wednesday

 CORRECTION:
An obituary of the civil rights leader James Farmer on July 10 referred incorrectly to the locations of school closings that resulted in a protest march he led in 1959. The march was called after schools in several Virginia communities were closed to avoid court-ordered integration. Schools in Richmond were not closed.
The article also misidentified the protester who was seriously injured by a mob in Birmingham, Ala., while trying to integrate interstate buses. He was Walter Bergman, not William Barbee.
In addition, the article misstated the affiliation of one of three civil rights workers who were killed in Mississippi in 1964. While Michael Schwerner and James Chaney worked with Mr. Farmer's organization, the Congress of Racial Equality, Andrew Goodman did not.
The obituary also misidentified a civil rights figure who refrained from criticizing Mr. Farmer's acceptance of a position in the Nixon Administration. It was Roy Wilkins, executive director of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People. (Roger Wilkins, a journalist and scholar, is his nephew.)

CONFUCIUS LIVES NEXT DOOR
 What Living in the East Teaches Us
 About Living in the West.
 By T. R. Reid.
 276 pp. New York:
 Random House. $24.95. 
 Just about 20 years ago, an old Japanese friend and business partner, driving back to Chicago with me after a festive golf-and-dinner Sunday in the suburbs, offered me some insight into the soul of his nation. "You know," he confided, patting one of his new graphite golf clubs, "you can forget about talk of Buddhism or Shinto or any other religion with us. It's just Confucianism. That's what we're all about."
Reading T. R. Reid's new book brought me back to that conversation. "Confucius Lives Next Door" is aptly named. Reid, a longtime reporter and Asia correspondent for The Washington Post, has nailed his copy of the Analects to the mast. Drawing on the experience of his own and his family's life in Tokyo and other east Asian points, he has written a paean to what he terms "east Asia's social miracle -- how the Asians have built modern industrial societies characterized by the safest streets, the best schools and the most stable families in the world." Asians, he holds, have "a sense of civility and harmony that you can feel," and they "achieved their social miracle primarily by holding to a set of ethical values -- what they call Confucian values."
About the values he is correct -- at least as far as the Japanese and to a great extent the Chinese and the Koreans are concerned. Few of us who have lived in Asia have failed to be struck by what the less reverent might call the harmony imperative -- stay together, don't do anything out of line and remember that you are each and every one a part of society.
Reid, who knows Japanese and has studied things Asian for many years, lived in a Japanese community, sent his children to an excellent Japanese public school and learned to put up cheerfully with his Japanese neighbors' codified concerns. "The Japanese," he happily notes, "are people who love rules." Written with grace, knowledge and humor, his book is a sympathetic Baedeker to the Japanese way of life. It is well worth reading for that. Not many foreigners have been able to fit in so well with their neighbors. His explanations of modern Japan and its Confucian background are accurate and useful, if occasionally wrongheaded. (Anyone who thinks that a lightweight writer like Akiyuki Nosaka deserves a Nobel Prize should take another reading course.) But he is certainly right that members of a grossly individualistic American Me Generation could learn a lot from the thoughtful groupiness of Matsuda-san and Reid's other orderly Japanese neighbors.
In Japan, for all its business and technological skills, social values take priority over purely economic ones. Reid's interesting description of a new-employee ceremony at a large Japanese corporation, in this case the electronic giant NEC, highlights his celebration of how Confucian ritual dignifies life in the Japanese workplace.
He is well aware that his defense of Japan's tight society is subject to criticism, and at the end of his book he concedes the widespread corruption underlying so many Confucian societies, the diversity that makes overall judgments tricky and the racial homogeneity that may play a great part in enforcing Confucian harmony. But he sticks to his central thesis, fortified by his obviously pleasant recollections of living in Japan.
There are, however, two flaws in this book that are hard to ignore. I share his fondness for Japan's national neighborhood. I lived there for 10 years with my family, and very happy campers we were. For the foreigner residing in this Confucian country is like a person given almost total access to an excellent, well-run and well-stocked club -- but without the need to pay any of the membership dues. When my friend the golfing executive talked about Confucianism, he was not smiling. He was, rather ruefully, acknowledging his membership in a society where conformity is inbred -- no need to be enforced -- and where the ethics of social relationships become a binding morality from which there is almost no escape. Over the years he became accustomed to making ritual bows to people he hated, promoting grinning idiots because their managers said they were "sincere" and ritually respecting authority that he knew to be defective.
Which leads to an inescapable comment about Japan's present state of economic sickness -- a sickness that may yet drag the whole world down with it. The sheer business facts are bad enough. Still, some $800 billion worth of bad bank loans, most of them the result of crony capitalism, are no laughing matter. Mass layoffs from the much touted full-employment society are in themselves shocking. (They include, not so long ago, the announcement of 15,000 jobs to be chopped off at NEC -- a ritual in reverse for a large number of new employees.) But the answer to these problems far transcends mere economics. Japan's real crisis is one of governance. Caught in the decades-long ecstasy of rising G.N.P., the Japanese electorate sold its collective soul to a corrupt, faction-ridden political party, backed by a decadent father-knows-best bureaucracy that has yet to grasp the virtues of real free enterprise.
No society in the world has a higher threshold of political indignation. Why? Because subservience to the Government is rooted in the ritual. It is not polite to protest, or to argue with those above you. Reid is right about Japan being a Confucian society -- more so, I believe, than any other country in Asia, including China. Unfortunately, the one fatal legacy left behind by the Master is the imperative to respect any lawful authority whatever. (It is no accident that partly Christian Korea and Buddhist Thailand, caught in the throes of even more obvious economic crises, have been able to throw out at least a part of their badly flawed governing structure.)
Admittedly, the Master's ritual and his sense of group responsibility tided the Japanese over the difficult postwar half-century, just as they did for centuries past during the troubled times of the old Tokugawa shogunate. But in a world that for better or worse has become globalized, marked by computer-assisted innovation, unsparing competition and virtually automated international money markets, it's about time to send the old boy packing.

Name-Dropping
 From F.D.R. On.
 By John Kenneth Galbraith.
 Illustrated. 194 pp. Boston:
 Houghton Mifflin Company. $26. 
 It is not usual for a man past his 90th birthday to write a book that is as fresh and lively as the work of a 30-year-old. But John Kenneth Galbraith is not a usual man, and he has done it.
"Name-Dropping" is not a perfect book. It declines from a full-scale portrait of a titan, Franklin D. Roosevelt, to sketches, affectionate but inconsequential, of sundry British and Canadian politicians who were Galbraith's friends. Inevitably, Galbraith's miniatures of even such considerable figures as the Canadian politicians Lester Pearson and Pierre Trudeau, or the British Labor Party leaders John Strachey and Roy Jenkins, are so many anticlimaxes.
For American readers, at least, it is Galbraith's take on the big cats, on Roosevelt and Truman, the Kennedys and L.B.J., that matters, and he has sharply observed things to say about all of them. A 6-foot-8-inch Canadian farm economist who wasn't even an American citizen, Galbraith first found himself working for Roosevelt in 1936. He tells some good F.D.R. stories, making the point that Roosevelt was able to convey vigor and vitality when he was "in the common reference a hopeless cripple" not just because the press and radio simply never reported his infirmity but because of "personality."
If Galbraith has remained in large measure a Roosevelt man, his Roosevelt was not Franklin but Eleanor. He worked closely with her on the board of the key liberal group of the 1950's, Americans for Democratic Action. "Far more than her husband," he judges, "she was a creature of conscience." His close relationship with Mrs. Roosevelt even survived his transfer of his political allegiance to a figure of whom she was deeply suspicious, John F. Kennedy. In the end, Mrs. Roosevelt was persuaded to come on board the Kennedy ship.
Galbraith affectionately records some characteristically crisp Kennedy dictums. Once, when Galbraith complained that The New York Times had called him arrogant, Kennedy retorted that he didn't see why it shouldn't: "Everyone else does." He also records Kennedy's three reasons for wanting Lyndon Johnson on the ticket in 1960. First, "Lyndon takes more of the Catholic flavor off me." Second, he would help in the South. "Third, it wouldn't be worthwhile being President if Lyndon were the majority leader."
Galbraith doesn't have to drop names: he has known everyone, or at least everyone who was on speaking terms with the liberal left. The names he does drop include those of Harry Truman, whom he greatly admired; Jacqueline Kennedy, for whom he had a romantic affection; and Jawaharlal Nehru, with whom he shared confidences as one Cambridge man to another. "You realize, Galbraith," Nehru said, "that I am the last Englishman to rule in India." He was especially close to Adlai Stevenson, of whose shortcomings, however, he was well aware.
Perhaps the most original profile is that of Albert Speer, whom Galbraith got to know, and to see through, when he interrogated him as part of the postwar assessment of the effect of Allied bombing on Germany. Galbraith's theory is that it was necessary for the Allies to build up Speer, Hitler's architect and a calculating intriguer who succeeded in minimizing his part in the horrors of slave labor camps, in contrast to the incompetent drunks and drug addicts who made up the rest of the Nazi high command. "Speer achieved much of the distinction he came to enjoy," Galbraith argues, "because he, virtually alone among those at the top, seemed a worthy foe."
Galbraith at 90 is gentler than the corrosive liberal advocate of the 1950's or the anti-Vietnam campaigner of the late 1960's. But "Name-Dropping" is still a contribution to history few others could make, and the humor remains as dry as a good martini.

THE FIRST SEX
 The Natural Talents of Women
 and How They Are Changing the World.
 By Helen Fisher.
 378 pp. New York:
 Random House. $25.95. 
 Evolution may have given men and women different bodies, but has it given them different minds? We all know from everyday experience that the sexes do not think exactly alike and that they tend to be good at doing different things -- say, reading maps (men) versus reading faces (women). Some social scientists insist that such differences are entirely due to culture. But over the last couple of decades, proponents of evolutionary psychology have been piecing together a case that the mind is naturally sexed. Our male and female forebears faced different evolutionary pressures in their struggle to survive and reproduce on the Pleistocene grasslands, and as a result they have different mental aptitudes and even differently organized brains.
The anthropologist Helen Fisher stands squarely in the evolutionary psychology camp. Nature, she believes, has given men and women distinct talents and brain structures. What is striking about her book "The First Sex" is where she takes this premise.
Whereas Darwin argued that evolution made men the superior sex (since they had to compete by wit and main for those passive reproductive vessels, women), Fisher comes close to making the opposite claim. The female mind surpasses its male counterpart in all sorts of ways, she submits. Women are better than men with language; they are better at contextual, "holistic" thinking and long-term planning; they are better at working cooperatively; they see and hear better, have a keener sense of smell and are more "in touch" with their emotions; they are even "superior performers in bed." All these natural advantages will serve them well in the high-tech economy and culture of the 21st century, Fisher maintains -- which is why "we stand at the doorway of what may become an age of women."
"The First Sex" is an original and often quite enjoyable book, but it must be read with great caution. The quality of Fisher's evidence is uneven, to say the least; it ranges from serious scientific studies to quotations from spokeswomen for professional organizations to articles in New York tabloids. A more serious flaw crops up in Fisher's logic. She freely puts her own speculative interpretations on new scientific findings, lets those interpretations harden into seemingly well-established facts and proceeds to explain these facts by making up a suitable evolutionary story.
Here is an example. The human brain consists of two hemispheres that are somewhat specialized in their functions. Neural scientists have found evidence, as yet quite tentative, that the bridge between the two halves is slightly thicker in women than in men. What does Fisher do with this shaky datum? She leaps to the conclusion that the female brain must be better "connected" or "integrated" than the male brain, and that this enables women to engage in "web thinking," which is superior to the poky "step thinking" of men.
Fisher goes on to explain how web thinking gives women a natural edge in all sorts of contemporary occupations, ranging from planning business strategy to curing illness to solving crimes. Her case would be persuasive if women really were especially gifted at reasoning hypothetically, manipulating contingencies and synthesizing information. But if such an advantage exists, it ought to show up in intelligence testing. And it doesn't. Females do somewhat better on some I.Q. subtests, like verbal fluency and arithmetic calculation. Males do better on others, like quantitative reasoning and spatial relations. When it comes to verbal reasoning and overall cognitive ability there is no detectable difference.
It is a dangerous business trying to draw conclusions about the natural talents of the sexes from the gross anatomy of the male and female brains. Is the female brain really more integrated, as Fisher claims? If so, it would follow that the hemispheres of the male brain are more specialized in their functioning -- and it is such specialization, or lateralization, as brain scientists call it, that distinguishes humans as a species from monkeys and apes.
Happily, "The First Sex" goes well beyond crude brain differences in pursuing its theme. Nature may have made men and women equally good at reasoning, but the sexes do not seem to be equally good at climbing hierarchies of power. Fisher suspects -- quite plausibly -- that this is in part a matter of hormones: "As testosterone and other male hormones contribute to men's drive to reach the top of the business ladder, estrogen most likely contributes to women's drive to take time out to rear their children -- undermining their ability to achieve these high-status jobs." Among the ample evidence she cites for the hormonal hypothesis is a study that found that women who had been subjected to high levels of testosterone in the womb pursued more male-dominated occupations and rose to higher positions.
But if women tend to be less keen than men at clambering up the ladder, they often do a better job when they do end up at the top, especially in politics. Fisher makes a strong argument that an increased female presence in the higher echelons of power will result in better governing. As a nice bit of anecdotal evidence she might have pointed to the Queens of England, who on average have been considerably more distinguished and effective sovereigns than the Kings.
"The First Sex" winds up with a rather rollicking trio of chapters on the "feminization" of sex, romance and marriage. They are stuffed with titillating facts ("Some women can even arouse themselves to orgasm without touching themselves. Only one man in a thousand can achieve an orgasm just by thinking"), and by the end, Fisher's boosterism on behalf of her sex has given way to a vision of equality: "The 21st century may be the first in the modern era to see the sexes work and live as equals -- the way men and women were designed to live."
While as a man I was relieved by the concluding emphasis on parity between the sexes, I wonder whether Fisher isn't still being a little too optimistic. After all, no less a feminist than Lady Violet Bonham Carter admitted that in spite of having devoted her life to the furtherance of women's rights she had come to the conclusion that there were three occupations in which men would always have the edge: hairdressing, dressmaking and cooking.

THE METAPHYSICAL TOUCH
 By Sylvia Brownrigg.
 390 pp. New York:
 Farrar, Straus & Giroux. $24. 
 THE first problem facing "The Metaphysical Touch" is that in outline it can sound a lot like the movie "You've Got Mail." Two literate, troubled, but essentially decent and likable people meet on the Internet and find that they're granted opportunities for intimacy and self-revelation that the real world denies them. Where Sylvia Brownrigg's first novel diverges -- and, to be fair, it diverges extremely quickly -- is that she's using this premise to conduct a philosophical investigation into the nature of being.
The female half of the couple (and the story is very much hers rather than his) is called Pi, "as in 3.141589, et cetera," we're told, though not until page 377. The male half is called J. D., perhaps as in Salinger, since he's an elusive, absent author whom we never meet except through his writing -- although his actual initials do seem to be J. D.
Pi is a philosophy graduate student. She was writing on "Kant's metaphysics -- on his stark, wisdom-starred vision of what was knowable in the world and what lay beyond the knowable," but lost everything in the 1991 Berkeley-Oakland fire. "Everything" here includes her cat, her books and all the work she'd done on Kant. As she admits, there are people in the world who would dust themselves off and start over again, but she isn't one of them. In fact, she can't even bring herself to step inside a bookshop. So she leaves the disaster and her old life behind, and moves up the coast to Mendocino to stay with the aunt and young cousin of a friend.
A colleague from the university sends her a modem so she can plug into the Net. Initially unconvinced about the joys of cyberspace (like Brownrigg herself, one feels), Pi finds a chat room called "Dickinson 536," as in Emily, and is led to the writing of J. D., who is posting sections of his "Diery," a discursive suicide note that will be completed only if he kills himself.
Pi is hooked and, calling herself Sylvia Plath, enters into a long E-mail relationship with J. D. His E-mails reveal that he's on the road in a rented car, visiting his sister in Baltimore, with California as his final destination. By now he's calling himself Hamlet, for any number of reasons: because he has an absent father; because he's looking for a soul mate, whom he calls his Horatio; and, most obviously, because he spends a lot of time wondering whether to be or not to be.
This E-pistolary exchange makes up about a quarter of the book, and although Brownrigg has very successfully caught that curiously banal, clever-clever, quasi-poetic style that seems to afflict so many inhabitants of cyberspace, I suspect that a lot of readers won't find these communications quite as endearing as the two correspondents do. How many of us would be completely enchanted by E-mails that conclude: "Is there room for this cluttered narrative in your dove-gray computer? I wish I could honor the goodness of your good night with something good of my own. But I hope you'll trust and believe my less poetic warm wishes, sent to you there in the Shangri-La land of your dreaming"?
A romance of sorts develops, but Brownrigg has much bigger things on her mind. We become involved with questions about ontology and epistemology, about absence and presence and where the physical and metaphysical worlds intersect. For one thing, there's the issue of where Pi's thesis was actually located. Was it really in the physical stuff of books, notes and computer disks -- or was it in her head? There are similar questions about J. D. Does he really exist? Is he telling the truth about himself? Is the "Diery" the work of one person or of various hands? Is it anything more than words, words, words? Cyberspace is, after all, a place where narrators can attain new levels of unreliability.
Martha, the friend's young cousin, whose mother has taken Pi into her household, adds to the speculation after Pi begins inventing stories to entertain her. These stories take as their subject a dead cat and dog who exist (if that's the word) as ghosts on the Other Side, yet affect this world by, for instance, making it rain cats and dogs.
Inevitably, everything is ratcheted up somewhat by the fact that we know we're reading a novel, that Brownrigg is the creator of all the texts, all the E-mails, all the philosophical uncertainty. This is done with a merciful lightness of touch.
Precisely as in "You've Got Mail," things come to a head when a meeting is proposed. There's a certain cliffhanger element in all this that deserves not to be spoiled, but suffice it to say that this J. D./Hamlet character turns out to be no Tom Hanks, and that the book's resolution is in itself a philosophical conundrum.
SYLVIA BROWNRIGG'S literary virtues are many. She's witty and smart, and she observes the world with a skeptical though not irredeemably jaundiced eye. Her invocation of Mendocino, "a place of New Age shopping and cosmic seaside revelations," is especially spry.
Her characters are authentic. A very minor one named Xander, who runs a Xerox shop, is beautifully and economically drawn. And if some of the other characters (like Martha, for instance) appear to this reviewer to be insufferable, that's a measure of the extent to which we're free to make up our own minds about them. Brownrigg is also extremely good on her heroine's sex life, which is primarily though not exclusively lesbian. A male reviewer has to be careful here, since the novel mocks men of the "I love lesbianism if you let me watch" school. Suffice it to say that Brownrigg does indeed let us watch, but it never feels voyeuristic.
I think there remains the question of whether this mostly rather domestic narrative can quite bear the philosophical load Brownrigg makes it carry, and there's a good case to be made that the book is about a hundred pages too long. But on balance one accepts the novel's ambitions, which are satisfyingly high and high-minded.
"The Metaphysical Touch" is a serious and intelligently wrought piece of fiction. It is perhaps old-fashioned, or at least unfashionable, in being a novel of ideas, but that is a large part of its appeal and a reason for its success. Meg Ryan won't be starring in the movie version any time soon.

 BODY:
What were you doing 12 weeks ago?
Twelve weeks ago was Nirav Tolia's last day on a pretty enviable job. He is 27, and in addition to managing the marketing of Yahoo!'s E-commerce properties, he had represented the company on television more than 100 times. Almost nobody leaves Yahoo!, but Nirav Tolia had just heard a really interesting start-up idea from a friend, Naval Ravikant, who had recently left @Home. It took Tolia about one day to decide, and the following morning he resigned. 
 Soon after Tolia's last day at Yahoo! he and Ravikant were joined by one of the highest ranking engineers at Netscape, Ramanathan Guha, who was cooking up an idea very similar to Ravikant's on the back burner of his big brain. By the end of the week, they were five strong. Eleven weeks ago, despite not having a single line of code written or even a paper sketch of the Web site they wanted to build, they got $8 million in seed financing from venture capitalists -- half from Benchmark Capital, which had financed Ebay, and half from August Capital, where Naval Ravikant was camping out as entrepreneur in residence. This gave the start-up what is believed to be one of the highest seed-round valuations ever.
Nine weeks ago, they brought on Lou Montulli and Aleksander Totic, two of the original six founding engineers of Netscape. Eight weeks ago, they moved into a second-floor gabled loft in Mountain View, Calif., and began grinding out 15-hour days, seven days a week -- but of course these guys had done that before.
In a spring when it had started to seem to some Silicon Valley veterans that all the big original ideas were gone, theirs was a lightning rod for talent. The new director of business development, Dion Lim, began to cut deals with other Web sites to import their data feeds. Seven weeks ago, they started hiring category managers. Six weeks ago, it became clear to Guha that enough of the original programming was already done, and he could switch hats from coder to manager. Five weeks ago, their venture capitalist from Benchmark, Bill Gurley, came by the office for his first look-see. He was blown away: "This is, unequivocally, the fastest I have ever seen a start-up move."
Four weeks ago, they began to cut distribution deals; two weeks ago, they settled on their marketing plan, and now, having reached a critical mass of 31 people, they are set to launch their Web site.
In 12 weeks, the amount of time it might take an average person to decide what kind of hedge to plant in the backyard, they built a company from scratch. An instant company, or what is being called in Silicon Valley a "second-generation Web company."
Not so long ago, it seemed incredible that a Web company could be born in a mere two years. But rather than going back to normal, the pace of creation in Silicon Valley now seems to be speeding up even more. Any Web company that starts out today and takes two years to get up and running is likely to be left in the dust.
In first-generation Internet companies, the founder and a few college buddies moved into a garage that they decorated with Nerf guns and green army men. In second-generation Internet companies, the staff coalesces not from friendships but from respect for mutually complementary skill sets. They skip the garage phase, engage two real-estate brokers and make simultaneous bids on three office spaces, hoping one comes through. They move in over the weekend and by Monday have it decorated with Nerf guns and green army men.
In first-generation Internet companies, the staff resigned from monolithic software corporations or took leave of business school or jumped ship on brand-manager positions at Procter & Gamble. Nobody had Internet experience; they learned by making mistakes, of which there were many. The purpose of the Internet was unclear. Now, companies are being formed by staff members who have years of know-how. And they see the Internet, above all, as a place to buy things. Some $301 billion was generated by the Internet economy in 1998, with an annual growth rate over the past four years of 174 percent.
Because of the way high-tech employees are compensated, there are likely to be a great number of second-generation start-ups in the next year. The notorious stock options that add up to so much paper wealth usually take four years to fully vest. For the early movers on the Internet, the four years are coming up. And the golden handcuffs are coming off.
This particular second-generation internet company has managed to recruit top people who were still handcuffed -- what people in the Valley call "the unhirables." Naval Ravikant walked away from what at the time was $4 million worth of unvested @Home stock options. Ramanathan Guha walked away from probably more than $4 million (a figure he is contractually forbidden to confirm) at America Online, which had acquired Netscape. Sabrina Berry's previous employer, CommTouch Software, was planning to go public. Berry walked away from all of her shares in that company. For Lou Montulli to join, he resigned from a hot, well-financed start-up called Geocast Network Systems. At the time Nirav Tolia left Yahoo!, the unvested options he left on the table were worth $10 million.
But, he insisted, it didn't matter to him if it was $20 or $20 million -- he has a dream to pursue.
"People are going to think I'm nuts," said Tolia, rolling his eyes.
"Can we not talk about this anymore?" said Guha. "It's painful to dwell on."
Six weeks ago, the engineering team walked to In-N-Out Burger for lunch. They crossed an overpass above Highway 101 and paused at the rail. "This team has been responsible for many of the key features of Netscape Navigator," Guha said. "These guys can point to any of these cars passing underneath and say: 'That driver has almost certainly used my code. And that driver. And that one.' We want to build something that has that kind of influence. We want to build a site that everyone will use."
So what's the idea that is inspiring so many to jump? Until this week, they've kept everything secret, operating under the code name "Round One." In fact, not even people who come in to interview for a position learn the idea their first day. Several hours of vague conversation seem to be leading up to the grand presentation, but alas, the applicant is sent home with a preliminary offer, setting out salary and options and title -- and no clear sense of what the company will do. If the candidate is sold on the team, then she or he comes back for a second round. Only at the end of that next day does she sit down in front of a whiteboard with Ravikant and Tolia and hear something like this:
As the Web becomes an infinite supply of goods and services, goes the pitch, people crave guidance on what and where to buy. So far, the great number of on-line shopping guides present quantitative, machine-sorted and machine-generated data: comparisons of product prices and specifications. But what consumers need (Ravikant and Tolia contend) is a recommendation that gets beyond that: the advice of someone they trust, someone just like them.
Their solution is a Web site, Epinions.com, which they envision as a sort of Zagat-for-everything, a site consisting entirely of consumer opinions or reviews of anything you can buy. Epinions.com itself will sell nothing at all -- it has no warehouse, no trucks on the back end. The money would come from deals Epinions.com cuts with companies that do sell things: every time an "E-pinion" prompts a reader to click "Buy," the company will earn a tiny commission on the resulting sale.
At the start, the E-pinions on Epinions.com will be culled from existing sources, guiding users through aggregations of expertise from the four corners of the Web. But the key to the whole idea is to make Epinions.com participatory, taking advantage of what I call the Tom Sawyer model. Write and post a short review of any product on Epinions.com, and you can earn a few pennies every time the review is read by another user. By letting readers rate the usefulness of the E-pinions, the most trusted ones will float to the top of every category. As Ebay is a marketplace for products, Epinions.com seeks to be a marketplace for ideas. If it catches on, like Ebay, then everything snowballs, and these hobbyist-reviewers function as sliver-time virtual employees who do all the work for you. "Everybody is an expert at something," they kept repeating around the Epinions.com office; they hope their site will be the place where everyone shares their expertise.
Similar logic has been welling up in the collective unconscious of Silicon Valley, and most E-commerce sites are already adding some form of E-pinion to their Web pages. Productopia, Deja.com, Cnet, Amazon.com -- everyone's hiring editors and bringing back the old-fashioned, well-trusted written word. Of course, sites that both sell goods and review them are subject to criticisms of bias. Epinions.com.com would be the first company to start up doing E-pinions and only E-pinions, hoping to be as Jell-o is to flavored gelatin.
And that's it. Then again, what was Yahoo! at the start but just a Yellow Pages to the Web? The point is that job recruits with demonstrable talent are buying in to give it a go. And they know that in the short and unpredictable history of Internet businesses, success has often come down to getting the details right, fast.
"We don't need any more strategists," says Mike Speiser, a McKinsey consulting alumnus who learned to curtail his own inclination to heady analysis. This was 10 weeks ago.
"We need closers," agrees Nirav Tolia. "We need bulldogs."
"We need engineers who are execution machines," says Guha. "This is not a strategy play. This is an execution play."
First-generation start-ups raise small seed rounds to develop a "proof-of-concept version," at which point the start-up has to go back to dog-and-pony shows, negotiating for more money. Again the second generation is different, faster. Prototypes, demos, alphas -- the language of the hustle -- those words aren't even in the Epinions.com vocabulary. Every minute spent dancing for investors is a minute stolen from the finished product. Ravikant and Tolia's business plan (which consisted of 16 sparse slides) had no financial projections and no budget. They negotiated for $8 million, enough that they wouldn't have to go back for more until well after launch. They had no idea what it would cost to pull together the E-pinions they would need to stock the site, but they budgeted $5 million, just to be safe.
The group's biggest fear was the wrath of prominent venture capitalists who did not get an opportunity for a cut of the deal. A slightly rattled Tolia played me several phone messages left on his answering machine by furious V.C.'s. One of the advantages of combining August Capital and Benchmark is that they occupy the same two-story building. When the terms of the valuation were set with August, Ravikant and Tolia walked upstairs to Bill Gurley's office at Benchmark. Gurley had joined Benchmark only a month before, and Epinions.com would be one of his first big plays for his new employer.
"I need to know if you're in," Tolia said.
Gurley was calm. He recounted some of the internal discussion among the Benchmark partners. One partner, Gurley offered, had scored the idea a 6.5 and the team a 9.5 on a scale of 1 to 10. But he wouldn't tell them details of how the final vote was scored.
"So where does that leave us?" Tolia asked.
"Don't worry, it's done," said Gurley.
"Should I contact your lawyer or something? Draw up term sheets?"
"We don't do term sheets here," Gurley responded, offering his palm. "We do handshakes."
In those first crucial weeks, the Benchmark investment was like having a Hertz Club Gold pass. Every service provider is overbooked in Silicon Valley -- realtors, phone-system installers, furniture suppliers, headhunters. Dropping the Benchmark name was the way to impress vendors without sharing the idea. Everyone wants to do business with what may become the next Ebay, dreaming they'll be rewarded with friends-and-family shares when the time comes.
Of course, they can't do everything. There was that first weekend in their new digs, when the parts for their desks arrived from Home Depot -- 25 solid wood doors, 100 4-by-4 legs and 400 metal braces. Despite this formidable team of engineering talent, in eight hours of off-and-on tinkering they couldn't correctly assemble any desks. Finally they called a carpenter who had done this before, and he started building two desks an hour.
Fortunately, what they don't know about desks, they do know about code. Hiring staff with seasoned Internet experience has allowed Epinions.com to delegate like crazy. "We need to be told what to do but not how to do it," said Luke Knowland, who had done it before at Wired Digital.
"It would take four very bright first-generation engineers a full year to program this site," Guha estimated. "But because we've done it before, we can write most of the code in six weeks."
Everything is faster. Zero drag is optimal. For a while, new applicants would jokingly be asked about their "drag coefficient." Since the office is a full hour's commute from San Francisco, an apartment in the city was a full unit of drag. A spouse? Drag coefficient of one. Kids? A half point per. Then they recognized that such talk, even in jest, could be taken as discriminatory in a hiring situation.
On the business-development side, "I no longer have to waste months evangelizing," says Dion Lim, who has been cutting deals to aggregate opinion material from existing Web sites. A couple of years ago, the process would have been slow and painful. "Now, I just call, and they have a syndication rate scale and a preferred data-feed format," he says.
Meanwhile, Epinions.com has kept up constant reconnaissance on the competitors it will be jockeying with this fall, despite those competitors' best efforts to keep their strategies secret. The Valley has what it calls the "whisper circuit," which is not so much wild gossip as the ability to call in old favors and threaten to pull people's teeth. A lot of whisper-circuit surveillance leaks out the back door of companies through their engineers, who often refuse to lie on principle or are very bad at it when they try.
Through the whisper circuit the company learned that one potential competitor was trying to wiggle out of a partnership so that it could overhaul its product toward something like Epinions.com. The team learned that a top job applicant, on the verge of accepting its offer, had been grilled so hard by another venture capitalist that he cracked and spilled the Epinions.com idea. (The offer was retracted.) Another V.C. was trying to discredit Epinions.com by telling people he'd turned down its deal, which he'd never seen.
And it was on the whisper circuit that the Epinions.com team learned that Amazon.com had started flying writers and editors to Seattle and offering them positions as category editors to cover a wide range of products -- food, video games and so on. The whispering was specific -- that Amazon.com was offering a $65,000 salary, a 10-percent signing bonus and options that could be worth $1 million in four years. (Amazon declines to confirm or deny those details.) The entrance of Amazon.com onto the scene seemed like bad news for Epinions.com. Everyone lost sleep that night.
But their exuberance returned with dawn. "Amazon is supersmart," said Naval, marching out of Benchmark Capital's Sand Hill Road offices with his teammates in tow. "But we're a start-up. We've got focus. Nobody will be able to move as fast as us. I pity the fools!"
"Other than that first night with Amazon, I haven't lost a single hour's sleep over our competition," Nirav Tolia said four weeks ago, when he was only rationing himself four hours a night anyway. "All the sleep I've lost has been over our internal conflicts."
Indeed. By hiring so many bulldogs and execution machines who were all used to being No. 1, Tolia feared the competition between employees would tear the company apart. For the first month, without a product to obsess about, they focused on their responsibilities, and the closest proxy for their responsibilities was their title. That they had given up so much money to be here made them a little testy -- they wanted constant assurance that their career decision wasn't a mistake.
Everyone kept demanding an org chart, preferably with his or her name in a box near the top. In first-generation Web companies, the premise was that no task was beneath you: you did whatever it took to succeed. This wisdom seems not to have been passed down. "How do we go from a team of champions to a championship team?" Tolia kept asking.
Bill Gurley had turned Naval Ravikant on to complexity theory. "Truly alive systems exist only at what is called 'the edge of chaos,"' Ravikant said in one meeting. So though it was causing him to lose hair, he was running the company on the edge of chaos, rallying people to risk making mistakes. "I don't want to be a company that plays it safe." He gave his employees an org chart, and then another one every week. Their titles became vague, more fungible.
Going through the start-up experience usually bonds a team together. There are those occasional "Breakfast Club"-like days when workers' inner lives get revealed to each other. This bedrock of goodwill gets the team through hard times later. Going through it at second-generation speed only allows brief bonding moments. Mike Speiser covered Internet companies as an investment-banking research analyst, but he hadn't worked at one before Epinions.com. A few weeks ago he said: "You know what I miss? I miss those good old days, when we had the run of the place at August Capital, hanging out and brainstorming." Those halcyon days, six weeks earlier.
Nirav Tolia came up with what he thought would be a solution to distract the champions from their fiefdoms. At the all-hands meeting five weeks ago, Tolia announced that he would shave his head if the company met its offical launch date. This is a guy whose E-mail was "the-face@yahoo.com" for a good reason -- a hair is never out of place on his head. "When you're wondering why you're here at 2 in the morning, think about my cue ball," he said.
Everybody howled with laughter. Then Aleksander Totic went over to his computer and pulled up an ancient Web page, from way back in 1994. Digital photographs were posted from the period when the original Netscape engineers shipped Navigator 1.0. There at the top of the page was a picture of Lou Montulli -- who is even more of a sharp dresser than Tolia -- with his head completely shaved. Then everyone really laughed.
"If we're going to be a second-generation Web company, Nirav's going to have to come up with something better," Totic chuckled.
Watching an instant company get built has been slightly disorienting. Silicon Valley is sustained by the myth that you can come here from anywhere with sheer smarts and a firm handshake and make good. Second-generation Internet companies seem to seriously tip the favor to those already here. Four weeks ago on the whisper circuit, Tolia learned that an entrepreneur from Arizona was in town to shop a business plan for a company, called Publicopinion.com, with some of the same basic concepts, like rating reviews. Tolia took the challenge seriously -- Publicopinion.com already had a prototype on line and needed financing to take the next step. But the truth is that if the guy from Arizona is only now trying to get an audience with venture capitalists, he probably doesn't have a chance to catch up.
After Ravikant left @Home, he would still see old colleagues at parties. The comment he heard from them time and time again was: "It's amazing you walked away from all that money. I wish I was brave enough to take the chance."
So why did they walk away from all that money? Take it as a given that they all believe in the commercial viability of the idea, but beyond that, their comments are all over the map. One guy talked blatantly about wanting "plane money," and how you weren't even a player in the Valley with less than $100 million. A few plead that they just want to live the start-up experience, and the money they've earned has bought them the unconditional freedom to pursue that dream.
Now they are at the takeoff point, and their first-generation experience can't help them. The next 12 weeks will be an even greater challenge: the goal now is to turn a brand-new site into a hive, one that has 80 percent of all E-commerce categories covered well in advance of the crucial Christmas buying season. They are blindly gambling that they have the right incentives and the right filtering mechanisms in place. Ready. Fire. Aim.

HEADLINE: TRAVEL ADVISORY: CORRESPONDENT'S REPORT;
The Caribbean Wonders: Where Are the Tourists?

BYLINE: By EDWIN McDOWELL 

 BODY:
AFTER a slow winter and spring, tourism officials in the Caribbean were hoping for better things for the rest of 1999. The NATO bombing in the Balkans heightened those expectations, on the assumption that many travelers would shun that part of the world and head for the Caribbean.
But Caribbean tourism continues to lag. With the number of tourists to some islands down about 20 percent, hotel occupancy levels are well below those of last year. 
 "Advance bookings for the Caribbean look reasonably good," said Michael Youngman, the executive director of the Caribbean Tourism Organization in New York City, but many tourism officials are somewhat puzzled by the no-shows, especially in view of a strong United States economy and predictions by the Travel Industry Association of America of another record summer travel season.
Some tourism officials in the United States blame rising crime in the region, a series of recent strikes, destruction from Hurricane Georges last fall and increasing competition from resorts in the United States, Mexico and Cuba. Cuba, for example, recently began selling packages combining a vacation on its beaches with a flight to Guatemala to visit Mayan sites and colonial cities.
The Caribbean hotel industry has long blamed the cruise industry for exacerbating the islands' woes, contending that by bringing visitors who stay only a few hours in port, the cruise ships have discouraged longer visits. And during the Caribbean Hotel Association meeting in Nassau, the Bahamas, last month, Ed Malone, the association president, returned to the attack, decrying what he called the islands' aid to the cruise industry.
"We have nothing but admiration for an industry that has succeeded in getting its ships built with subsidies from foreign governments," he said, "sail under flags of convenience and recruit staff from the cheapest, non-unionized labor pools in the world, and then sail the Caribbean in a cruise operator's tax-free heaven. While our governments help keep foreign ship lines afloat, we are sinking on our own shores."
In the past, cruise officials have countered that many cruise passengers later return to the Caribbean on land-based vacations, but this time they mostly ignored the criticism -- perhaps because they have troubles of their own. Cruise fares to the region have been relatively flat this year, averaging less than $100 a day per person including port charges but not air fare. Airlines to the region also cite a slump in passengers and fares.
Financial woes of cruise lines and airlines have long-term implications for tourists. A Carnival Cruise Lines spokesman at the hotel-association conference said that while cruise passengers to the Caribbean have doubled in the last decade, the region's share of the overall cruise business has fallen from about 67 percent in 1989 to slightly more than 50 percent, and so the line will reduce or not add capacity in the region.
A spokesman for American Airlines, the dominant carrier in the Caribbean, said that in part because of lower fares from competitors, its Caribbean profits fell in the first quarter of this year from the comparable period in 1998 and would likely decline further in the second quarter.
But many of those lower fares are still higher, on average, than fares to Cancun, Mexico, or to Europe. In fact, the week of the hotel conference, British Airways and American offered a free round trip to London with each round-trip economy ticket purchased before June 30.
Meanwhile, tourism to Barbados fell 2.5 percent the first quarter of this year, after growing 9.3 percent during the same period last year. Dominican Republic tourism has been battered by lingering effects of Hurricane Georges and a drop in European tourists. And Bermuda, although not in the Caribbean except for purposes of keeping tourism statistics, has also been struggling with sub-par hotel occupancy.
To reverse that, Bermuda is advertising extensively in the United States and Canada. But it got off to a shaky start when a supposed tongue-in-cheek newspaper advertisement suggesting that four days in Bermuda are better than in the Hamptons drew the wrath of Long Island tourism officials. They retaliated with an advertisement saying: "With 1,400 square miles, Long Island's attractions are endless. With 20 square miles, Bermuda's attractions soon end."
Still, some islands appear to have more visitors than last year. Hotel occupancy in Puerto Rico increased 4 percent over the first four months of 1999, compared with the same period in 1998. The Bahamas also seem to be doing better than expected, in large part because of the expansion of the 2,000-room Atlantis Resort and Casino on Paradise Island.
Among the reasons suggested for the Caribbean's slump is that familiarity has bred boredom. And after protests over a gasoline tax led to three days of riots, looting and violence in Jamaica in April, cruise ships and airlines canceled scheduled visits and flights to the island; Jamaican hotels subsequently reported wholesale cancellations.
Caribbean officials acknowledge that some fear remains after a recent series of violent crimes throughout the Caribbean. Although few of the crimes involved tourists (most were drug related), it is hard to dispel the perception of danger, especially when tourists have many other options.

HEADLINE: Where the Trout Jump Onto the Hook

BYLINE: By JAKE MOSHER; JAKE MOSHER, a Montana resident, writes frequently about the outdoors.

 BODY:
THE mountain goats had climbed down the 300-foot rock wall separating Montana from Idaho in the night and now, in the dim light of early morning, they stood at Slagamelt Lake, whiter than the mist rising from the surface. I watched them, three nannies and two kids, until a trout rose between us. When I looked up from the ripples the goats were gone, enveloped in thick fog.
The fish came to my first cast, bending the bamboo rod into a smooth arc and sending a spasm of vibrations up my arm. The three-pound cutthroat, a brightly colored male, fought well. He hung at my feet for several seconds after I released him, then swam for deeper water, the spots on his back blending with the stones on the bottom. 
 I rinsed my hands in the cold water and looked to the east. More than a mile below where I stood in southwest Montana's Bitterroot Range lay the upper Big Hole River Valley. More than 60 miles of river bottom stretched out before me, cut off from the rest of the state by the Bitterroot, Anaconda and Pioneer mountain ranges and interrupted only by canyons of rapids and a handful of frontier-style ranching communities. I had three days to fish, hike and explore this little-visited expanse of Montana back country about 50 miles southwest of Butte last July and already wished for more time.
Slagamelt's outlet, like many of the Big Hole's tributaries, was easy to step across. It tumbled down through a corridor of Engleman spruce trees and granite boulders ranging in size from those of basketballs to small houses. Wherever the water swirled around a fallen tree or bent against the bank, I found aggressive brook trout, sometimes three or four to a pool. The white edging on the brook trouts' fins, the rings of blue haze around their red side spots, and their square orange tails stood in sharp contrast to the rushing whitewater. It was easy fishing and by midmorning, I'd caught and released close to three dozen.
After a few hours, I left the spongy, stream-side moss and hiked through a forest of lodgepole pines and thick-barked Douglas fir. Through a hole in the branches, I watched a golden eagle gliding in circles, slowly moving higher until it became a dark speck against the sky. When I could no longer see it, I leaned forward with my pack and picked up my pace, pushing down from the Bitterroots into the upper Big Hole River Valley.
It was already close to noon, and by the time I reached my truck, the July sun was bearing down and my legs were aching.
Much of the wilderness in the Big Hole Valley comprises Federal Forest Service lands open to the public and bounded by a well-marked network of dirt roads. Most are passable by car, and provide good jumping-off points to mountain lakes like Slagamelt, to scenic meadows and to remote trails traveled far more by deer and elk than by people.
Driving out of the Bitterroot foothills on such a road, I stopped three times to allow small herds of black Angus and white-faced Hereford cows to cross. All over southwest Montana, except for Interstates 90 and 15, cattle have the right of way. They range on Forest Service grazing allotments, moved from pasture to pasture by cowboys.
The entire upper Big Hole Valley is marked by a very precise timber line. Hayfields along the river blend into a rolling prairie of blue-green sage that in turn gives way to Douglas fir and pine. There, the Rocky Mountains seem to shoot straight into the sky.
I rounded a bend and suddenly found myself in the open. Twelve miles ahead, on the eastern edge of the valley, were the heavy forests of the Pioneer Mountains, and to the north the Pintlers in the Anaconda Range, whose jagged, snow-capped peaks looked like giant, prehistoric sharks' teeth. A swath of willows marked the river's path, and the sun was shining off the dozen metal roofs of Jackson. Ready for lunch and a cold glass of water, I was glad to see civilization.
At Rose's Cantina, while my hamburger hissed on the grill, a pair of ranchers discussed the relatively wet June the valley had seen and how, with a bit more rain in August, the perennial threat of drought could be ignored for a season.
An hour later, driving north along the river on Highway 278, through what is known as "the land of 10,000 haystacks," I realized why the ranchers seemed so relieved. For more than a mile on either side of the Big Hole, hay meadows in various stages of cutting spread away from the river, surrounding handsome barns and log cabins, many of which have stood for five generations. Dozens of haystacks, 30-foot cones of loose grass, dotted the landscape, standing exactly where they would when the cows, home from their summer pastures, would tear at their sides in December.
EIGHTEEN miles from Jackson, in the town of Wisdom, I turned west onto Highway 43 and crossed the river. I wanted to visit the Big Hole National Battlefield, where Chief Joseph's Nez Perce Indians, forced out of Idaho and desperately trying to avoid capture by Gen. Oliver O. Howard's troops, held off the soldiers for two days in 1877. As I listened to the taped narrative at the visitor center, hearing of the women and children who were shot down, the soldiers and warriors who fell, it was hard to imagine that this lush creek bottom at the foot of the Pintler Mountains had been the site of such carnage.
I stared at the 12-pounder mountain howitzer employed in the battle, and read the plaque beside it that detailed how its explosive shells operated, and decided I had seen enough. It was getting late in the day, and I didn't want to end it by dwelling on this sore spot of the Big Hole's history. I pointed my truck back toward Wisdom, then northeast, paralleling the river as the valley began to narrow.
Thirty miles from Wisdom, the Big Hole meets the Wise River, and the town by the same name. A handful of outfitters operate out of the one-store community, guiding anglers over some of the most productive trout waters in the west.
Craig Fellin, owner of Big Hole River Outfitters, which includes a group of log guest houses centered around a large main lodge, has been guiding float trips for 16 years. He agreed to guide me on the Big Hole the next day and showed me the cabins, which had hand-hewn beams. Pictures of fish adorned the main lodge, which had a high-ceilinged dining room with views of unbroken wilderness in every direction.
As I had planned before meeting Mr. Fellin, I pitched a tent at a Forest service campground nearby, and I met Mr. Fellin the next morning just as the sun came up. We unloaded his Avon rubber raft on the Wise River, a few hundred yards upstream from its junction with the Big Hole, helped his chocolate Labrador retriever, Kodiak, into the boat, and shoved away from shore.
It was immediately apparent that I was in the hands of a first-rate guide and fisherman, as well a man with a great deal of patience. When my fly fell short of its target, my leader tangled, or I did not cast in time, the most I heard was, "nice try," "here's another spot up ahead," or "good cast."
I hooked my first trout, a small brown, in a backwater where the Wise joins the Big Hole and, since Big Hole River Outfitters operates a strictly catch-and-release business, watched Mr. Fellin let the trout go. We floated down the Big Hole, through rock canyons of rapids, long pools where grass hung over the water and stands of cottonwoods. Over a shore lunch of seafood salad, grilled ginger chicken, banana bread and cherries, our conversation drifted to the places we'd been, those we wished to go, the trout of the day and the trout we had not yet caught.
Through the afternoon, as the water temperature rose toward 70 degrees, the trout grew increasingly sluggish, reluctant to leave the deeper pools for my fly, and I took more time between casts to enjoy the scenery. Floating past the stone abutment of a collapsed bridge, Mr. Fellin explained that a century earlier, a narrow-gauge railway had spanned the Big Hole, its iron tracks providing passage for carts of gold ore mined high in the Pioneers.
He talked of Cowbone Lake in the Bitterroots, named after a hapless rancher who lost his herd through the ice one spring more than 100 years ago, and how legend has it the trout, fed well by beef, grew to immense proportions. As I listened, I reeled in my fly and looked upstream over my shoulder at the snow-capped mountain ranges that seemed to protect this wild and beautiful valley from the rest of the world.
"Why don't you try my rod?" Mr. Fellin suggested as we neared the end of our float. He handed me his Montana-made R. L. Winston, complete with a custom reel seat sporting a colorfully painted brown trout, and pointed to a run between two boulders.
The rainbow trout was on almost as soon as the fly touched down, surging upstream against the current, peeling line from the reel, moving as fast up river as the rapids carried us down. Mr. Fellin nosed the raft into shore, netted the trout, held him for a second for me to admire, then returned him to the Big Hole.
For my final day in the upper Big Hole Valley, Mr. Fellin had arranged for me to accompany a Wise River outfitter, Cliff Page, on a horseback trip into Schultz Lake, 8,500 feet up in the East Pioneers. I met Mr. Page shortly after 8 A.M., and half an hour later, in a Forest Service parking lot on Jacobsen Creek, was introduced to Slick, the 11-year-old gelding that was to carry me over eight miles of trail to Schultz.
For the first time during my stay in the valley, I was leaving my rod behind and traveling light. Schultz sits in a rock bowl at the base of three 10,000-foot peaks, and I was hoping to photograph mountain goats on one of them. Mr. Page slipped Slick's bridle on and asked me to saddle up.
"If the stirrups are too long, your thighs will hurt," he said. "If they're too short, your knees will hurt. But if they're just right, then everything will hurt."
By 10:30, I was well aware that Mr. Page had done a fine job of fitting the stirrups. We rode through meadows dotted with clumps of blue lupines along lower Jacobsen Creek, steep sage hillsides full of the scent of elk and narrow cuts through forests of spruce. A sharp ascent just after noon brought us at last to the blue waters of Schultz Lake.
Mr. Page tied the horses in the shade of a dilapidated cabin he said had belonged to the Schultz family, stressing that they had lived in it year-round for more than a decade near the turn of the century, and this year he had encountered four-and-a-half-foot snow drifts in its yard on June 23. With that thought fueling an if-they-can-do-it-I-can-do-it attitude, I set my sights on the highest peak.
The first hour of climbing was relatively easy. I followed an elk trail up a tongue of timber. Where the trees petered out, boulders, loose gravel and an increased pitch slowed my pace dramatically. The elk trail gave way to mountain goat paths littered with clumps of their winter hair, shed recently for the short alpine summer. Mosquitoes and a hot sun hampered my ascent, but with the story of the Schultz family inspiring me, eventually I crested a ridge a few hundred feet from the summit, where a goat thoroughfare led straight to the top.
Stunted lupines and tiny sprigs of pink fireweed carpeted the summit, lending brilliant color to the gray stone. Less than 50 feet from the top, seven mountain goats stood up from their beds, and I was able to shoot a roll of film before they left.
Above me was a great blue emptiness, and below stretched the upper Big Hole drainage, devoid of any trace of humans. The hay meadows near Jackson were little more than green smudges below the blue forests of the Bitterroots. I closed my eyes and felt once more as if I were floating down the Big Hole, a rod bent double in my hands as a rainbow trout ran hard against the current.
 
Plenty of room for man and beast

HEADLINE: The Way We Live Now: 7-11-99;
Land of the Free Market

BYLINE: By Michael Pollan; Michael Pollan is a contributing writer for the magazine. His last article was about his childhood home.

 BODY:
I live just beyond the dilating fringe of the New York metropolitan area, in the kind of place that was called "the country" until a few years ago. That's when the ratio of urban refugees to farmers shifted in a way that made that designation feel self-conscious, so people began calling it "the exurbs," a word formerly used only by urban theorists. The place still looks the same, with lots of forests and fields outlined by old stone walls, but you sense it's been brought under the cultural and economic jurisdiction of Manhattan. How can you tell? The quality of the coffee has suddenly gotten much better.
I quite like living in the exurbs, and while I hope this fine form of civilization -- this late-20th-century cross of countryside and latte -- will last indefinitely, I've always assumed that it won't, that my town will eventually succumb to the ineluctable, almost geologic forces of sprawl. There didn't seem much anyone could do about it, at least nothing that didn't feel selfish or elitist or hypocritical, not to mention perfectly futile. But that was before the Clinton Administration made "quality of life" a fit subject for national politics, and Vice President Gore kicked off his campaign talking, of all things, about sprawl. 
 The sprawl threatening the quality of this particular life is massed somewhere to the south of where I live, and I recently took a drive down Route 7 in search of its current frontier. I had only driven 15 miles, through the cornfields and pastures strung along the Housatonic River, before encountering a new townhouse development just north of New Milford. I recognized it as sprawl because it has one of those sad picturesque names ("Twin Oaks") that memorialize whatever feature of the local landscape has just been obliterated.
As I continued south, the big maples gave way to even bigger signs, the traffic thickened and the franchises began reiterating themselves every five miles or so, the only indication that I'd left one town and entered another. I tried to decide what it meant -- was it ridiculous or significant? -- for a Presidential candidate to declare that the sorry state of this landscape (even this traffic!) was the nation's business. "In too many places across America," Vice President Gore had said in a January speech laying out his Livability Agenda, "the beauty of local vistas has been degraded by decades of ill-planned and ill-coordinated development." The agenda itself was so Clintonian in its modesty (a thimble of money for buying open land, a minor rejiggering of Federal highway spending, some funds to encourage "smart growth") that I initially dismissed it as the urban-planning equivalent of school uniforms.
But the response to Gore's initiative has been so vociferous as to make me think again. The free-market think tanks spewed forth studies arguing that sprawl doesn't really exist or that, if it does, it's exactly what Americans want. George Will detected in the antisprawl movement an echo of 60's disdain for middle-class consumer culture. A high-ranking official of the National Association of Homebuilders issued a threat to any politician who dared get in the industry's way.
As I thought more about it, I realized that George Will may actually be on to something. For by elevating "livability" to a national issue, the Vice President has put a new spin on two legacies of the 60's that the right thought had been safely disposed of a long time ago. One of these is the conviction that "the personal is political." The other is the habit of questioning the wisdom and sovereignty of the free market. Rub these two supposedly discredited ideas together, and you can generate some surprising political heat.
This Administration's quality-of-life issues -- a rubric that embraces everything from family leave and the V-chip to traffic congestion, movie violence and smoking -- are often derided in the media as examples of small-bore, middle-class, "feminized" politics. Yet the very act of injecting such personal matters into national political discourse draws the middle class, unawares, into a conversation about capitalism that is anything but trivial. For implicit in that conversation is the notion that the free market need not have the last word on the state of the American landscape or public health or even popular culture. In a remarkable feat of political jujitsu, Clinton and Gore have taken the right's own emphasis on "values" and turned it into a middle-class critique of consumer capitalism.
Conservatives like to argue that, with sprawl, the free market has given Americans exactly what their spending decisions say they want. And yet many of us -- or maybe I should say some part of most of us -- are dismayed by the landscape and traffic that our own dollars and desires have wrought. That's why it is possible both to deplore the arrival of a new Home Depot in my area and also to shop there.
The right would have you believe that the real me, the only one that finally matters, is the shopping me -- the consumer; the deploring me should be dismissed as a sentimentalist or elitist or hypocrite. Until now, that's been the general view on sprawl, one I've bought into myself. But it overlooks a complicated truth about modern life that conservatives would have us forget. It is that although we are consumers, we are not only consumers, but parents and neighbors and citizens too. The sort of world we bring into being with our dollars does not necessarily match the world we would vote for with our hearts, and one of the things politics is good for is to help us bring those worlds into a more pleasing alignment. What a radical idea.

How new residential developments get named, according to the marketing folks who name them:
 
* Whispering Woods (Moon Township, Pa.) "It's near the airport, so we wanted to insure that people didn't think it was under a flight path. We also wanted them to know we were keeping as many trees as possible. People like trees." Bill Hunt, president, Elmhurst Company
 
* Ladera (Orange County, Calif.) "Ladera' doesn't mean a thing; it's value neutral. So the residents can hang on the word the idea of what they are." Brooke Warrick, president, American Lives
 
* Renaissance (Henderson, Nev.) "Originally we named it Veneto, but people had trouble pronouncing it, so we are now changing the name to Renaissance. A lot of people relate to the cultural situation that describes the Renaissance. It is also easy to pronounce." Joyce Mason, director of marketing, Pardee Homes

HEADLINE: The Way We Live Now: 7-11-99: Salient Facts: Contaminated Seafood;
Sea Sickness

BYLINE: By Andy Newman 

 BODY:
WAITER, HOW'S THE VIBRIO VULNIFICUS TODAY?
With months containing the letter R on seasonal hiatus, this is the time of year when many wary diners -- especially those with compromised immune systems or livers -- steer clear of raw shellfish and the health hazards that warm weather tends to heighten. The best-known hazard is oysters, which in summer are especially vulnerable to Vibrio vulnificus, a bacterial disease that flourishes in warm waters and kills 10 to 15 liver patients a year. But that's only one of a tankful of marine pathogens. Together they cause well over 100,000 cases of food poisoning annually in the United States (though billions of servings of seafood are safely consumed). And of those, many are a year-round presence.
 
WHAT ELSE MIGHT BE LURKING IN MY PLATEAU DE FRUITS DE MER?
There's Vibrio parahemolyticus, rarely fatal, but "an equal-opportunity gut-wrencher," in the words of George P. Hoskin, a marine biologist with the Food and Drug Administration. The Norwalk virus is a relatively common risk in oysters harvested from sewage-tainted waters. (In January 1997, a Louisiana oysterman who was himself suffering from the virus dumped his sewage into the very waters he was fishing and sickened 432 people in five states.) And amnesiac shellfish poisoning, which is less common, causes short-term memory loss, facial grimace, disorientation and coma.
 
ON SECOND THOUGHT, HOW'S THE FISH?
Don't ask. If members in the scombroid family, like tuna and mackerel, are not kept ice-cold, bacteria can break amino acids down into histamine, causing itching, hives, swelling of the throat or nausea in those who eat them. Reef-dwelling fish, like grouper or barracuda, that have consumed toxic plankton can contain ciguetera, a neurotoxin that can leave diners with years of joint pain, pins and needles or the always-jarring confusion between hot sensations and cold. After that, there are any number of rarer threats like tapeworm larvae, hepatitis and mad-fish disease, which causes fever and shaking.
 
HOW PREVALENT ARE THESE ILLNESSES?
By far the most common is the Norwalk virus, which the F.D.A. blames for about 100,000 of the 113,000 cases of seafood poisoning reported a year. Scombroid poisoning, the next-leading contaminant, hits about 8,000 Americans a year (and in 1997 sickened 26 World Bank employees who ate blue marlin in the company cafeteria), while ciguetera strikes 1,600 people. V. parahemolyticus and Hepatitis A affect about 1,000 people each.
 
HOW CAN YOU SPOT TOXIC SEAFOOD?
You can't, for the most part. The major seafood-borne illnesses don't change the appearance or taste of seafood at all, and seafood that looks, smells or tastes off is not necessarily ambulance bait. Seafood that has been cooked thoroughly is safe from Vibrio and the Norwalk virus (freezing or cooking will kill parasites, too), but heat has no effect on scombroid toxins or ciguetera. Some Gulf oyster suppliers pasteurize their oysters by heating them briefly, which offends purists but dramatically reduces Vibrio. And lemon juice can kill bacteria, but only on those surfaces it touches. Other than that, you take your chances.
 
ISN'T THERE ANY WAY TO BETTER THE ODDS?
Caroline Smith DeWaal, the director of food safety at the Center for Science in the Public Interest in Washington, advises sticking to restaurants or fish stores that know their suppliers and know how the fish has been handled from the time it came out of the water -- as difficult as that sounds. And obviously, seafood is likely to be fresher at places that sell a lot of it.
 
THEN ARE POULTRY AND RED MEAT THE ONLY SAFE BET?
Hardly. "We don't like to get into this contest, quite frankly," Hoskin says, "but on an illnesses-per-pound basis, fish and shellfish are as safe as beef and poultry, and fish are safer than hamburgers." Doughnut, anyone?

HEADLINE: ART / ARCHITECTURE;
Discovering Poetry Even in the Clutter Around the House

BYLINE: By JEFFREY KASTNER; Jeffrey Kastner, a contributing editor of Artnews, writes on cultural topics for The Economist and other publications.

 BODY:
OUR modern lives are replete with stuff, clogged with both the essential and the essentially worthless. Kitchen drawers and bedside tables hide secret ecosystems of hoarded rubber bands, rogue Q-Tips and cryptic plastic widgets whose purpose has long since been forgotten. Left unchecked, these agglomerations grow and spread, becoming small universes unto themselves. For the 30-year-old conceptual artist Sarah Sze, this material profusion presents more than just a housekeeping problem. It's also the rich source for her sprawling found-object installations -- works that celebrate the lyrical potential in clutter, the meaningful relationships that people develop with even the most impersonal trappings of their everyday environments.
Although she has split her time between New York and Berlin in the last year, during the last few months Ms. Sze (pronounced Zee) could be found most days in Brooklyn at her Dumbo studio, preparing for simultaneous high-profile summer exhibitions at Chicago's Museum of Contemporary Art and the Venice Biennale. 
 Looking like a supply depot for an oddball five-and-dime, the artist's small work space serves as a warehouse for the unlikely raw materials she accumulates -- plastic tubing and cotton balls, peanuts, sponges, thread. On a recent visit, it also afforded a glimpse into the extraordinary fate that awaits these ordinary items, as Ms. Sze conducted a tour along the length of a carefully orchestrated cascade of clutter that wound through the middle of the room, a funky landscape of doodads punctuated by plants, lamps and swaying towers of matchsticks, a Plexiglas cube filled with water roiled by an aerator, a length of toilet paper rustling in the breeze of a small fan.
"I'm trying to explore why some things become important to us," says the Boston-born artist, "to take things people are familiar with and invest them with some value and tenderness." If the objects Ms. Sze uses seem unconventional, the way she uses them, she suggests, is not far removed from the traditional formal training in painting and sculpture she received as an undergraduate at Yale. "I think of the whole piece as a canvas," she says, "and the process of building the works as very painterly. It involves a formal understanding of color, movement, edge, composition. It's also painterly in the sense that it's improvisational. You put down a 'mark' and then decide whether or not to keep it, and what's most incidental often turns out to be most exciting."
Ms. Sze's pieces can appear chaotic and ramshackle, but they often entail considerable engineering expertise. At last year's Berlin Biennial, for instance, she devised a system of cantilevers that allowed her to coax a spindly tower of matchsticks and Q-Tips over 20 feet into the air while, near the floor, a complex arrangement of pumps and fans kept several plants watered. And her current piece at the Italian Pavilion in Venice is a delicate arching trail of wires, lamps and toothpicks that swoops from floor to ceiling, a series of camouflaged anchors making it seem to float above viewers' heads like an alien chandelier. "I like the idea of structures that are right at the edge of their capacity to hold together," she says.
Although her Chicago show (which remains on view through Aug. 1) is Ms. Sze's first solo exhibition at an American museum, she has over the last two years become increasingly visible on the international circuit.
Since completing her master's degree at the School of Visual Arts in New York in 1997, she has mounted projects at institutions across Europe, from Greece and Luxembourg to France and Austria. Last summer, at the Institute of Contemporary Arts in London, she filled a gallery with a dizzying array of stuff -- pieces of candy and plastic forks, tea bags, coins, batteries, pasta, straws, pills, pencils -- that climbed up the walls, into the corners and out onto the ceiling.
And over the next few months, Ms. Sze is scheduled to create pieces for a show in Avignon, for the Cartier Foundation in Paris and for her solo debut in New York, planned for September at the Marianne Boesky Gallery in SoHo.
While she continues to build all her pieces improvisationally on location, Ms. Sze's hectic exhibition schedule has led her to begin developing some initial motifs by working on small sections of the constructions before installation begins. Yet even pieces as elaborate as the 15-foot segment she has been fussing over in her studio are completely broken down for shipping and then recreated in often radically different guises in the spaces where they're shown, incorporating local components the artist collects in the given city. Afterward, the works are disassembled and put back in boxes, their constituent parts ready to be used again in another place, and in another way.
"I like the fact that the works are ephemeral and portable," says Ms. Sze as she carefully skirts a tiny colony of pale green Styrofoam chips that marks one boundary of the sprawl, like a pocket of parkland at the edge of a miniature cityscape. "It's a bit like when you move -- you take everything and put it away, and then you take it all out again and reinstall it. It's still all exactly the same stuff, but because it's a different place, it can take on a whole new identity."

HEADLINE: In the Region / New Jersey;
State's Site Standards Upheld, but Debate Continues

BYLINE: By RACHELLE GARBARINE 

 BODY:
IN the last decade, builders and municipalities have taken their debate over mandatory statewide residential site-improvement standards from the legislative and regulatory arenas to the courts.
The standards -- governing such matters as street widths, pavement thickness, sidewalks, curbing and sewers -- were challenged by 157 communities and the League of Municipalities, in a suit contending that they infringed on local zoning powers. In May, however, the New Jersey Supreme Court upheld the standards. 
 Before uniform standards were adopted in 1997 -- four years after the state law calling for their creation was passed -- each municipality adopted its own standards, which builders argued drove up construction and housing costs. The goal in unifying the standards, state officials said, was to reduce costs while protecting public health and safety.
"The bad news is that the court did not overturn the standards," said William G. Dressel Jr., executive director of the League of Municipalities. The good news, he added, is that because the court recognized that specific standards could have an adverse affect on local zoning -- and, by extention, the design and character of communities -- a municipality may argue that such a standard is not valid.
Opponents of the state standards are now pursuing a legislative remedy, moving the debate full circle back to the legislature.
The league, which represents most of the state's 566 municipalities as well as homeowner groups, is lobbying for two bills. They would require the Department of Community Affairs, which governs housing and supervises the standards, to amend the regulations to deal only with engineering and construction items, create a range of standards to account for geographical and ecological differences and prohibit intrusion upon local zoning powers and design issues.
Stuart R. Koenig, the lawyer for the league, said the legislation "calls for more flexible standards in the hope of reducing costs." Otherwise "there are sure to be lawsuits" once the housing market turns downward, he said, noting that to many the current regulations "are another bureaucratic process that is rigid and unyielding."
Among the standards opponents of state regulation remained concerned about are those dealing with the widths of roads, the lengths of cul de sacs, the number of required parking spaces and the maintenance of stormwater and retention basins. Charles A. Richmond, assistant commissioner of the Department of Community Affairs, countered that the legislation was unnecessary, adding that the process in place, as the courts found, "deals with those issues, is reasonable and provides predictability and fairness.
"As far as we're concerned the debate is over," he said. "But it will continue because people believe there is an intrusion on home rule, whether or not these standards have a negative or positive impact."
Proponents of the standards say that they are based on widely accepted performance criteria and take into account a town's needs and zoning regulations. They also note that the regulations implementing the standards were devised by an advisory board of state and local officials, planners and engineers that reviews the standards annually and will, if warranted, modify them.
Moreover, proponents of the standards say, the regulations let municipal officials and builders seek a waiver from adhering to any standard shown to jeopardize public health or safety. And they may receive exceptions to do more or less than what the standards require, if the changes are slight and if both sides agree to them, said Mr. Richmond.
Since the 1997 adoption of the regulations, exceptions have been granted to 75 projects, he said, adding, however, that no waivers have been sought or granted.
ONE such project is Heritage Landing, 132 single-family detached homes rising off Whitehead Avenue in South River in Middlesex County. Under the standards the street widths, for example, are 28 feet wide instead of the 30 feet that would have been required, said David Fisher, vice president of land development at Matzel & Mumford of Hazlet, the developer. An exception, he added, also was granted on pavement thickness, going to 5.5 inches over the base surface, rather than the 4.5 required under the standards or the 8 inches the zoning would have allowed.
"We saved a little time because we knew what was expected," Mr. Fisher said. "And we could bring the project to the market sooner, which is important in a competitive market."
Joseph E. Doyle, executive director of New Jersey Planning Officials Inc., contends that there still is no evidence that housing costs are lower as a result of the standards. Rather, he said, taxpayers are contributing to the state's management of the standards.
The problem is not the goal of the original legislation, added Phyllis Matthey, but that in their implementation some of the standards go beyond the intent of the legislation. Ms. Matthey is president of the Coalition of Associations for Political Action, an Edison-based group that represents 90,000 homeowners in condominium, co-op and planned communities and is lobbying for the new legislation.
For instance, said Ms. Matthey, who is a real estate broker, the standards that apply to parking "are unrealistic" for attached-housing communities in the suburbs because they reduce the number of required spaces, which could make such communities "less attractive places to live." The parking issue combined with the narrower streets the standards allow also pose safety risks, she added.
That concerns the New Jersey Fire Prevention and Protection Association, said Robert J. Davidson, the Fire Marshall for South Brunswick and an association member. He noted that the regulations were designed without a fire-safety representative on the advisory board, adding that the association was compiling a report on the standards' impact on safety.
"Not all the standards are bad," Mr. Davidson said, "but some need to be tweaked." As an example, he pointed to the standard allowing parking on both sides of a 30-foot-wide road, which he said hinder the movement of fire and emergency vehicles.
"We already are experiencing problems with planned communities built under the old rules which did not allow parking on both sides of a road," he said. "The new standards exacerbate the problem."
Opponents of the state standards also say that the strong residential market has kept a lid on conflicts over the regulations because developers have been more willing to compromise.
Take for instance Peter Blicher, who heads the state's division of Westrum Pennington L.P in Pennington, a residential developer that has approvals to build 88 homes for buyers age 55 and older off Bunkerhill Road in Lawrenceville. Although Mr. Blicher said the standards "made the process reasonable and predictable," the project has hit a snag.
He said while under the standards the homes, clustered in groups of four, could be served by one sewer line, instead of one line per house, the Lawrenceville-Ewing Sewer Authority is insisting on the latter. Still, he said, he will install the four lines if the state doesn't intervene soon "since I have reservations for 65 of the houses." He said the result could be that $2,000 will be added to the home prices, now in $140,000 to $160,000 range.
Both opponents and proponents of the state standards agree that the standards are not totally being followed and in some cases are being ignored or abused.
"The standards are not doing what was expected and that will become clear when the economy turns sour," said William Dressel, of the League of Municipalities.
Joanne Harkins, director of land use and planning at the New Jersey Builders Association in Plainsboro, disagrees. "Two years is too short a time to say if the standards are accomplishing everything they were expected to achieve, but they are helping."
The standards "are not a silver bullet," but they are gaining acceptance, added Mr. Richmond, of the Department of Community Affairs. "Our concentration is to make people more comfortable with the standards," he said, "so they give us feedback on how to improve them and give the rhetoric a rest."

HEADLINE: In the Region / Long Island;
As Rents Climb, Co-op Sales and Prices Turn Up

BYLINE: By DIANA SHAMAN
AFTER renting in the Park Slope section of Brooklyn, for eight years, Nancy Heiss, who works as a project manager for a Manhattan office furniture company, decided she wanted to buy rather than continue as a tenant.
But with apartments in both Park Slope and Manhattan so expensive, she said, her search brought her to Long Beach, an area where her parents had once lived, and where she has relatives. 

 BODY:
 She found a $120,000 one-bedroom co-op at 600 Shore Road through a local real estate agent, Marilyn Topper, closing on June 16. The 94-unit oceanfront building has an indoor pool. Her apartment has a side view of the ocean and her $600 a month maintenance includes taxes and heat. With mortgage payments, her monthly costs are $1,300, which is $300 less than one-bedroom rentals in Park Slope, she said.
"I had some savings, interest rates were down and I just felt the time was right for me to buy," said the 35-year-old Miss Heiss.
At one time, the Long Island co-op market was almost moribund in some areas, and price increases are still lagging behind those of houses and condominiums.
"The last market to have been lifted up in the suburbs has been the co-op market because buyers feel that condominiums offer them greater flexibility," said Kenneth R. Jacobs, a Manhattan and Yonkers lawyer who is president of the metropolitan area chapter of the Community Associations Institute, a national organization of co-op, condominium and homeowners associations in Alexandria, Va.
Co-op buyers often do not like the idea that boards have so much control, Mr. Jacobs explained.
Owning shares in a cooperative corporation instead of receiving a deed to property is still an alien concept for many suburbanites, said Mark J. Walsh, Consolidated Communities of Long Island, a group representing 75 co-op, condominium and homeowners associations in Suffolk.
"Co-ops have the same pools and amenities as condominiums, the buildings are in good shape, the grounds are nicely kept and they are in good shape financially, but people are still a bit leery of co-ops," he said.
But a turnaround is now being swelled by first-time buyers like Miss Heiss who are tired of pouring money into rent and by older purchasers. For those couples, many of whom are selling their homes at high prices, co-ops offer a way to stay in their communities in a maintenance-free setting that, unlike a rental, has tax advantages.
The revived interest in co-ops began in areas like Great Neck, which has a heavy concentration of apartment houses, but now appears to be affecting sales everywhere as prices of single-family houses and condominiums continue to climb.
"The market started turning around slowly the beginning of the year and it is now really starting to move," said Elaine Nolan, a Hempstead broker, about her area of Mineola and Hempstead.
"Six months ago, we got 3 calls a month for co-op loans; now we are getting 10 to 15 calls," said Richard Shyman, the president of I.M.S. Capital in Melville, a mortgage broker. "Co-ops are viable again and mortgage money is there again."
"Prices are coming back incredibly and we are seeing a lot more action," said Steven J. Greenbaum, director of property management at Mark Greenberg Real Estate in Port Washington, which manages about 40 co-op buildings in Nassau.
FOR a long time, "there was almost no market," said Michael F. Cohen, a Smithtown lawyer who represents 20 co-op complexes in Suffolk. "But the price of co-op apartments is so disproportionate to the cost of homes that people realize they represent a lower-cost alternative and are something they can still afford," he added. "The co-ops I represent have seen sales and prices they have not seen for a number of years."
These observations are echoed by co-op owners. "Nowhere on Long Island is the market comparable to what's happening in Manhattan, but it's definitely picking up after being sluggish for a good number of years," said Michael Herzog, president of the co-op board at the 68-unit Cedarhurst Park in Cedarhurst.
Prices for a one-bedroom apartment in the building have gone up to $85,000 from $60,000 in three years, Mr. Herzog said, and two-bedrooms have risen to $120,000 from $90,000. "We are getting young couples who can't afford a house and who want to own something, and older people selling houses who want to stay in the area," he said.
Raymond J. Ellmer, the co-op board president of the 84-unit Seaview Terrace in Long Beach, said that would-be buyers were calling at the rate of "about five calls a week."
Prices in the building have seen a "tremendous jump" over the last two years, said Mr. Ellmer, a Garden City lawyer. Still, with prices ranging from $80,000 for a studio to $190,000 for a two-bedroom, "the co-ops are reasonably priced for people who have sold a home and want a smaller place and also for young people just starting out," he said. Many young professionals are coming to Long Beach, he added, because of the beach community style of living.
At the Valley Park Estates co-op in Valley Stream, the sponsor, VP Owners in Great Neck, which still owns 130 of the 436 units in the complex, had been renting them out for years because nothing was selling.
Now it has more buyers than empty apartments available, said Jeffrey Bookman, one of the principals. "A year ago, we had no activity," he said. "Now we are selling four to five units a month." With prices for the one- and two-bedroom apartments ranging from $40,000 to $60,000, and monthly rents for the same units ranging from $850 to $1,100, "people realize it's cheaper to own than to rent," Mr. Bookman said, adding he has 20 units under contract.
"The major issue for me was owning something rather than renting," said Lucian Gonzalez, an engineer, recently bought a one-bedroom unit at Valley Park Estates, paying $40,000. With maintenance of a $495, his monthly costs come to only $800, Mr. Gonzalez said. He had been paying $700 a month to rent a studio apartment in Howard Beach, Queens. "I also view my co-op as a steppingstone to eventually purchasing a house," he said.
JOEL GREENBERG, a salesman for a hair products company, and his wife, Diane, who is in real estate sales, moved into the Plaza, a Lawrence co-op, four years ago, after selling a four-bedroom home in North Woodmere. The building is next to a country club with golf and a marina and is a short walk to the train station.
"I lived in a house for 30 years, and I didn't miss the house three minutes," said Mr. Greenberg, now board president at the Plaza, a luxury building with a pool and a doorman where two-bedroom apartments now sell for $250,000 (up, according to Mrs. Greenberg, from $195,000 a year ago).
It is buyers like the Greenbergs who are also fueling the Great Neck market. People are selling large and unwieldy houses to move into a community where amenities, shopping and transportation are all nearby, said Ellen Steinberg-Finkelstein, who specializes in co-op sales at Trylon Realty in Great Neck.
"Years ago, people would sell their houses and rent, but now they want to buy because rentals are too expensive," she added. "My problem is that I don't have enough inventory."
Two of her recent buyers, Doris and Seymour Graylin, came from 34 years of living in a two-family house in Bayside, Queens, moving last week into a two-bedroom co-op in Great Neck, for which they paid $300,000, not counting extensive renovations.
"Never another house," said Mrs. Graylin, 69. Her husband, a retired accountant, is 75. "I don't want to weed the garden anymore or shovel snow," Mrs. Graylin added.
Their new apartment is two blocks from shopping, restaurants and the Long Island Rail Road station "so we won't have to drive so much," she added. "Renting was not an option," she said, "because we wouldn't have any tax benefits."
Prices in Great Neck have been rising, Ms. Steinberg-Finkelstein said. Studios that started at $30,000 two years ago now begin at $55,000. A typical one-bedroom has gone to $175,000 from $142,000, and a two-bedroom to $350,000 from $235,000.
"We are reliving 1985 to 1986 again because, with the decrease in the amount of houses on the market, that leaves co-ops," said Jan Kalman, a real estate agent in Woodmere.
In Roslyn, where small houses start at $250,000 and there is also a shortage of houses for sale, "co-ops are the best alternative if you want to get into a good school district," said Roy Sobel, a local broker. Prices for a one-bedroom start at $60,000, and a two-bedroom recently closed for $79,500, he said.
"Many people can't afford a home, but they want to buy something and so they are buying co-ops," he said.

HEADLINE: Developing an Illinois Suburb, With Principles

BYLINE: By DAVID W. DUNLAP 

DATELINE: GRAYSLAKE, Ill.

 BODY:
"COMPACT, transit-oriented development" is how planners say, "a suburb where you can walk to the train station from your house."
A mantra of the anti-sprawl movement, this concept is endorsed by Chicago Metropolis 2020, an influential planning advocacy group headed by George A. Ranney Jr., a lawyer who was formerly president and chief executive of Inland Steel Industries.
Mr. Ranney is not just preaching the concept. He and his wife, Victoria Post Ranney, plan to add a "compact, transit-oriented" town center to Prairie Crossing, their 667-acre development now under construction in this village 40 miles northwest of Chicago. 
 Not only would this town center be an easy walk to a new train station planned on the Metra commuter rail line, it would be laid out on a tight grid of narrow streets, with lots as small as 5,000 square feet. Studio apartments over detached garages would bring an economic mix of residents. And shops, some with dwellings upstairs, would be scaled to neighborhood needs: a bakery, a deli, a general store.
Apostasy, in other words, in the world of conventional suburban subdivisions.
But the five-year-old Prairie Crossing project already breaks so many rules of conventional development that it has drawn national attention far out of proportion to its small size. Of the 317 single-family homes permitted on the site, 133 are now built and 20 more are under construction.
The community is organized around 10 guiding principles -- available for browsing at www.prairiecrossing.com/principles.htm -- including environmental protection, economic and racial diversity, convenient and efficient transportation, energy conservation, esthetic design and "lifelong learning," from child care through courses at a nearby college to informal adult education.
Buyers choose from 12 prototype frame houses that resemble homesteads. With gabled roofs, jaunty pediments, deep porches, clapboard siding, sash windows and white trim against a palette of rustic colors, they exude so much Americana they almost bring an Aaron Copland melody to mind.
"The development," the Chicago Tribune Magazine said in May, "looks like a well-edited version of the Midwest." Nearly 70 percent of the land, 463 acres, is set aside as prairie, pasture, farmland and wetland, with a serpentine lake suitable for swimming, small ponds, a community-supported organic garden and stables for horses.
The tradeoff for this ample communal space is that individual lots are clustered more closely together and are smaller than they would be in a conventional subdivision. However, Mr. Ranney said he is finding that "people care more about access to open lands than having enormous lots."
And Mayor Pat Carey of Grayslake said the village has made use of the concept elsewhere. On one site where zoning was previously limited to one-acre lots, Grayslake will now permit lots as small as the developer cares to build, provided that 50 percent or more of the property is set aside as contiguous open space and that there is no increase in the overall number of houses.
Such an environmentally obliging approach comes at a price: $330,000 for the average house at Prairie Crossing, Mr. Ranney said, or about 20 to 30 percent higher than comparably sized houses in the area. That is good for the business success of the development but has tended to work against the diversity goal.
"WE have done much better than anyone else around here," Mr. Ranney said, "but our hope was that we would have a minority population somewhat larger than we do." It is estimated that 8 percent of the families at Prairie Crossing are African-American, contrasted with 1 percent in the area.
To encourage a greater mix, the Ranneys would sell 25 smaller houses in the town center for $180,000 to $220,000. Buyers on some lots could build 600- to 800-square-foot studio apartments atop their garages for family use or possibly for rent. The Ranneys propose to increase the number of single-family homes to 400, from the maximum of 317 now permitted. The plan is designed by Calthorpe Associates of Berkeley, Calif.
"There's certainly an appeal to the kind of development they're proposing," Mayor Carey said. "If a good deal of people walk across the street to take the train, that balances against the increase in density, in my mind."
However, the Mayor is only one of seven members of the village board, whose approval is required for the new plan. And there is no predicting the outcome of its deliberations later this summer.
Some Prairie Crossing residents wonder whether a town center that draws outsiders may deprive them of the comfort of knowing everyone on the street by sight. They are concerned about the impact on amenities like the little beach along the lake. And there is an unspoken fear that lower-priced houses in one part of the development might depress values elsewhere.
Even broader concerns, felt throughout surrounding Lake County, center on new burdens being placed on already overcrowded schools and roads.
"When we approved the development, we allowed 317 homes," Mayor Carey said. "That's cast in stone at the moment. That's a significant issue. There is a potential for concern about increasing the number of houses in any development at this time."
Donna M. Mack, who moved to Prairie Crossing from Chicago last year, said of the Ranneys' plan: "If anybody can make this work, I think they can. It wasn't what I envisioned and it wasn't what I expected. But I think it can work."
The Ranneys said the extra density is needed in part to offset the expenses they have faced dealing with "outside threats," particularly a nearby landfill. They also pointed out that Prairie Crossing would come nowhere near the 1,600 units approved for the site in 1986.
In 1987, the property was acquired by Gaylord Donnelley, the former president and chairman of R. R. Donnelley & Sons Company, an enormous printing concern founded by his grandfather in 1864. Mr. Donnelley, a conservationist, owned a farm in the 2,000-acre Liberty Prairie Reserve, which adjoins Prairie Crossing. He and other investors founded Prairie Holdings Corporation to develop the site.
After Mr. Donnelley died in 1992, Prairie Holdings was taken over by his nephew, Mr. Ranney, who grew up a half mile away. Donnelley family members are among the largest investors in Prairie Crossing, as are the Ranneys. Mr. Ranney is a partner in the law firm of Mayer, Brown & Platt.
Ms. Ranney is the great-granddaughter of George B. Post, an architect whose works include the New York Stock Exchange, City College campus and the former New York Times building on Park Row. She has edited a volume of the papers of the landscape architect Frederick Law Olmsted.
"I'm surprised and delighted to see that if you lay out guiding principles, the debate tends to be whether you're meeting them," Ms. Ranney said. "People are taking up the cause of Prairie Crossing in ways I would never have guessed five years ago."
Parents are establishing a charter school, publicly financed but independent of local school boards. Although the charter was opposed by the two school districts that serve the area, it was granted on appeal by the state Board of Education. Classes will be held in a pitch-roofed country schoolhouse where farm children were once educated. The earlier school closed in 1958. When the Ranneys learned in 1995 that the owner sought to raze the building, they offered to move it to Prairie Crossing. Come August, it will be home again to 60 youngsters, from kindergarten through second grade.
With "lifelong learning" as a guiding principle, Ms. Ranney said, "We thought we needed to start at the beginning."

HEADLINE: OUT OF ORDER;
There's Something About Garbage

BYLINE: By DAVID BOUCHIER; E-mail address: liorder@nytimes.com

 BODY:
TUESDAY is the high point of my week: garbage collection day, a ritual of cleansing and purification when all the excesses of the past seven days are swept away and out of sight. On a Tuesday morning, everything is potential garbage to me, as I hunt through the house with my all-consuming extra-heavy 30-gallon drawstring trash bag. When the bag is out at the end of the driveway in the big green can (secured with a rubber strap for the amusement of the neighborhood dogs), I feel a solid sense of achievement. As long as I keep putting out the garbage, I postpone the inevitable moment when I become garbage myself.
I like to hear the garbage truck growling in the distance like a hungry dinosaur, getting closer and closer. Sometimes it stops for a while outside our house, as if amazed by the quantity and quality of the offering and digesting it noisily like a hungry man in an all-you-can-eat restaurant. 
 America has the biggest, most impressive garbage trucks in the world and the most garbage -- 200 million tons a year. In some profound sense, garbage is the gross national product, and we produce our share.
It's a bit of a mystery where it all goes. Most of the landfills of Long Island have been turned into recreation areas or golf courses, so I suppose it gets carried off to Oklahoma or somewhere they still have a few square feet of empty space. That would explain why the trucks so often arrive in our neighborhood much later than scheduled, and why the drivers look so tired. The main thing is: the garbage goes away. Those distant landfills work like the Freudian unconscious, where we dump all the things we don't particularly want to remember.
Recycling is a great idea, of course, but it's not as psychologically satisfying as plain garbage. Garbage is about excess and waste. Recycling is about control and responsibility, and it doesn't inspire much enthusiasm first thing in the morning. On the other hand, there is something soothing about the recycling routine. We have a little calendar provided by Riverhead Town, so we can look ahead and see that this Wednesday is mixed recycling day and Dec. 29, right before the millennium, is the day to put out paper. When the future is so uncertain, it's good to know that one's life has some purpose and direction.
In the town of Riverhead where we live, the recycling rules are simple. Bottles, cans and plastic all go into one bright blue container, rather nauseatingly called the Curby Can. I don't envy whoever has the job of sorting out all that stuff. Paper products are bundled together and picked up on alternate weeks. Brookhaven Town, next door, has a long list of forbidden materials, including radioactive waste, explosives and swimming pools, although it's hard to see how even the most dedicated recycler could get a swimming pool into a Curby Can.
In Nassau County, I'm told, residents have an even tougher assignment. They must separate glass, plastic and metal objects, which we throw all together into the same can, and they must carry out a complicated operation on their paper products: newspapers must be separated from magazines, envelopes with and without windows, cardboard, Victorian romantic novels, used train tickets, and so on -- a long list of distinct recycling categories with terrible penalties for the homeowner who gets confused.
Obviously, the more precisely our trash is divided, the more potentially useful it is. In the end we could reach a steady state where everything is recycled right back to being what it was before, and nothing will need to be produced at all.
Recycling is nothing new. The human race has been recycling the same old jokes for thousands of years, along with the same political promises. Television has become the greatest recycling medium of all time, and has not used a new idea since 1946. Some people spend a lifetime recycling their memories of childhood, or weddings or divorces or operations or obscure injuries to their self-esteem.
The planet itself is nothing but a giant recycling mechanism. All our air and water is recycled one way or another, although we don't want to think too hard about that. When we drive we burn gasoline, which is just recycled organic stuff. The used gasoline turns into air pollution, and then into medical fees, and then into the doctor's yacht. In due time the yacht will sink into the mud at the bottom of the sea, the wood will rot away, and in a few million more years the doctor's yacht will turn into oil, which can be pumped up, turned into gasoline and start the whole cycle over again.
Perhaps the whole universe is just a random mechanism for recycling heat and light and stray molecules into random forms like strip malls and Presidential candidates. When these forms have outlived their usefulness, they will be broken down into molecules and reconstituted as something entirely different, and perhaps more useful. This may be the actual secret of the universe. The true answer to the eternal question "What is the meaning of life?" may turn out to be "Recycling."

HEADLINE: The View From/Hartford;
A $22 Million Restoration for Mark Twain House

BYLINE: By STEPHEN L. PURDY 

 BODY:
LIKE the slow evolution of a novel, the Mark Twain House has become a work in progress. The 19-room mansion where Samuel Clemens wrote "The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn" is undergoing a $22 million renovation that is expected to return the house to its original condition.
A big part of the renovation was completed in May. The work on the house, which was designed in 1874 by Edward Tuckerman Potter and Alfred H. Thorp, included restoring exterior wood and tile, the patterns of orange and dark blue-grey on the terra cotta brick, and rebuilding the purple slate roofs. 
 The biggest challenge, according to contractors Thomas J. Kronenberger & Sons of Middletown, was the chimneys. With narrowing bases precariously held by corbeling (aesthetic buttresses that projected from inside), they studied the original designs, then applied mortars much stronger than the originals, along with other reinforcements.
"It's detective work," said the curator, Marianne J. Curling, of the detailed process of finding originals and reproductions of all materials, from furniture to textiles and window treatments. "It's really fun, you have that 'Eureka!' moment," she said, laughing, "and then you can reproduce."
' moment," she said, laughing, "and then you can reproduce."
The project is expected to be completed at the same time a documentary on the author by Ken Burns, who created the documentary "The Civil War" in 1990, airs on public television in autumn 2001.
With key research in 1995-96 by the Historic American Buildings Survey and the Society for Preservation of New England Antiquities, plus written documents on Twain and digitally enhanced photographs, contractors and volunteers began the exterior upgrades one year ago.
The drawing room, one of the three interior spaces restored over the last four years, features carefully reproduced salmon-pink wall stenciling and original chairs and settees whose tufted upholstery had been covered by another layer. Ms. Curling explained how digitized photographs helped workers on details for the portieres, the curtains hung over archways, being completed by Elaine Gladstone, a volunteer who has embroidered and beaded them for 18 months.
Such minute examination also helped Ms. Curling reclaim the unusual yellow and pink tones in the master bedroom's woodwork, as well as the grey of the porches and soffits outside, long covered by red.
Among the many survey facts were details on Mrs. Clemens's work with the interior designers, Louis Comfort Tiffany and Associated Artists. "When they hired them, they didn't realize they were hiring the greatest purveyors of the Aesthetic movement," Ms. Curling said.
Tour guides point out that, while the house is Victorian, its daily activity involved a contemporary social parallel -- the professional working at home. With Twain's original study next to his daughters' bedrooms, their activity distracted him and he began his permanent habit of walking to the third floor and working in the billiards room.
Early Twain revivalists chartered The Mark Twain House as a nonprofit organization in 1929. "Not because the house was a great Victorian home," explained Executive Director John Boyer. "It was the birthplace of Tom and Huck."
For roughly the next 30 years, the house hosted a library branch, a one-room museum, and apartments. Interest in its restoration emerged in the 60's, and that interest increased as the home approached its 100th anniversary in 1974.
Ms. Curling suggested that the home's ups and downs were partly in the Clemens spirit of the house as always "a work in progress" anyway. And it's a pragmatic philosophy she uses for its maintenance and progression now.
While displaying a loaned Victorian-style sideboard, in its original but not yet restored dining room spot, she said she hopes the piece will one day be in the museum's permanent collection.
She said the restoration will include chestnut paneling in the kitchen, the dining room's displays of mixed sets of flatware and china, and the carriage house, now used for meetings, will again house carriage and sleigh.
Mr. Boyer said a computerized resource center will be built in the basement for "kids to learn 19th century stenciling so they actually understand it when they visit the house," he said, "and have meaningful interaction with Twain ideas and characters on the Web."
The premier addition will be a 28,000-square-foot education and visitors' center attached to and blending with the carriage house. With galleries, a theater and meeting space for symposiums and lectures, school and storytelling programs, the center will hold the museum's library, including early Twain editions and rare manuscripts.
"It will get things on site that we can't do at the moment," said David Bush, a spokesman for the Twain house.
It's this center and the museum's role in strengthening Hartford, plus its place in the upcoming documentary, that key donors mention when describing why they gave to the capital campaign to renovate the house. Melinda Sullivan, a Hartford-area philanthropist who, with her husband, Dr. Paul Sullivan, donated $1.5 million, said, "You hold your head up a little higher when, asked where Hartford is, you reply, "Did you know that Mark Twain wrote quite a few of his significant works here, had a home designed and built here?' "
While Mrs. Sullivan hopes their donation will spur other people to give, the list of corporate and charitable donors includes the Maximilian E. & Marion O. Hoffman Foundation, the Hartford Foundation for Public Giving, The National Endowments for the Arts and Humanities and The Hartford Financial Services Group.
Administrators of the renovation fund refused to say how much had been contributed.
With four acres next to museum property donated by the city of Hartford, the state Department of Economic and Community Development gave $3 million for parking, exteriors and the visitors' center.
Governor John Rowland even helped raise funds. His wife, Patricia, also a board member of the museum, said, "We've supported Mark Twain House in a variety of ways because we want Connecticut residents to discover, and rediscover, the magnificence in their own backyard."
Mr. Boyer said that although the house's appeal lies in a growing interest in Victorian design and structure, it's based most on the author's wit and clarity.
"He's been called the American Shakespeare, because his works operate simultaneously on so many different levels," he said. "He reaches so many different audiences at the same time."

How to Save Wildwood? Make It Even Wilder

BYLINE: By BILL KENT 

 BODY:
Among the many gimmicks that have promised to liven up Wildwood have been a Victorian-themed shopping mall, a comedy club district, a casino and a ski-lift contraption that would carry visitors over the island's burning-hot beach, known locally as the Desert, and drop them within a short walk to the surf. The mall failed; the comedy clubs bombed; the casino was aborted by politicians who favor Atlantic City, and the ski lift is still on the drawing board.
Cut to the summer of 2001. A gigantic crimson crab writhes menacingly atop the just-completed $65 million Wildwood Convention Center. Every 15 minutes, it extends an enormous pincer down to the boardwalk, snatches up a tourist and drops the victim into its steaming maw while delighted family and friends take pictures. 
 "It's a cooked crab," explained Mark Davison, a British-born student of landscape architecture at the University of Pennsylvania, who spent his spring semester studying Wildwood's resort culture. "But here it is, enlarged to a preposterous scale, eating, or appearing to eat, a man. It's just perfect for Wildwood, where everything that's natural is really artificial, and vice versa."
Mr. Davison's crab is among 60 proposals resulting from a three-year study of Wildwood's history, tourist economy and pervasive 1950's building style by three architecture professors and 45 students from Penn, Yale and Kent State Universities. So are a boulevard of sky-high neon-pink flamingos; an avenue of lime-green plastic palm trees; spaceship-shaped lifeguard stations; classical caryatids in polka-dot bikinis; towering video screens showing 1950's situation comedies; a fake Saharan oasis on the beach, and animated signs so huge that they can be read from passing airplanes.
The designs are on display through the summer at the Doo-Wop Preservation League at Pine and Pacific Avenues. Reactions have been "mostly positive," said Mayor Duane Sloan. "We will not have giant crabs on public buildings, as a matter of policy, but as for plastic palm trees, that's the kitschy, over-the-top kind of thing that Wildwood shouldn't be ashamed of."
Jack Morey, an amusement pier owner and hotel developer, has already ordered eight plastic palm trees for a restaurant he is renovating. Mr. Morey initiated the study in 1996 when he gave Steven Izenour, an architecture professor at Penn, a $15,000 grant. The purpose, Mr. Morey said, was to "find out what it is about all of these 50's motels and restaurants and other buildings that we have here that make Wildwood distinctive, and look for ways we can build on that."
With money from the Greater Wildwood Tourism Bureau and the non-profit Doo-Wop Preservation League, the study's most important result "was to legitimize at the academic level Wildwood's architectural heritage," Mr. Morey said. "When most of this stuff was built in the 1950's, it was the new thing across the country. Now, with the retro trends in cars and clothes and music, it's all coming back."
He admitted that some renderings scared people when the study's preliminary suggestions were made public in January. But those who were shocked just didn't understand what Wildwood is all about, said Susan Snyder, a Penn professor and a partner in the Philadelphia architectural firm Company for the Civic Arts, who assisted Mr. Izenour with the study. She explained they were lucky they hadn't torn down their island's streamlined, tropical-hued, aluminum edged, fluorescent-and-neon trimmed-motels, which seemed so dated in the earth-toned 1970's and Victorian-revival 80's.
"There are really two faces of Wildwood," Ms. Snyder said. "Part of the island wants to turn into something more mainstream. They were horrified when we suggested we wanted Wildwood to be more in the doo-wop style because they're aspiring to what they think is a higher taste. From what I've learned about the island's history and tourist economy, these people are dead wrong. The island's economic well-being extends from the boardwalk honky-tonk. It's not enough for Wildwood to be tacky. It has to become wonderfully tacky."
Through August, eight undergraduates studying architecture under Prof. Dan Vieyra of Kent State will be "solving real business problems by renovating motels and restaurants in ways that aren't tasteful or polite," Professor Vieyra said.
"What's attractive about Wildwood is it's the classic corruption of straitjacket modernism driven by mom-and-pop capitalism," he said. "The challenge is to carry this tune and make it even louder."
Such strategies, with or without giant crabs, stand a better chance of improving Wildwood's dwindling tourist base than attempts to copy successful resort cities like Cape May, Mr. Izenour said. A partner in the Philadelphia firm Venturi, Scott Brown & Associates, and a co-author, with Robert Venturi, of the 1971 post-modernist manifesto "Learning From Las Vegas," Mr. Izenour used to vacation in Wildwood with his family and developed a taste for the island that he believes others can still acquire.
"What we're saying with this study is that Wildwood is 95 percent O.K. as it is -- just don't ruin it," he said. "Cape May was created along a very, very tight plan, and it's nice, it's cute, it's tasteful, but it doesn't have that kind of unplanned, pie-in-the-face fun that Wildwood has always had. The way to solve Wildwood's tourism problems is to encourage a crazy, wacky, non-conforming atmosphere where people can get the feeling that anything can happen. The worst thing that could happen to Wildwood would be to impose any kind of rigorous outside order on it."

HEADLINE: COMMERCIAL PROPERTY;
Insignia Group's Expanding Universe

BYLINE: By JOHN HOLUSHA 

 BODY:
IT would be hard to argue that Andrew L. Farkas, the chairman and chief executive of Insignia Financial Group, is afraid of change.
Starting the company in 1990, he built it into one of the largest owners and managers of residential properties in the country. Then, in 1996, he acquired the Edward S. Gordon Company, one of the largest commercial real estate services companies in the New York region, and used it as the base for building a nationwide and international network of commercial offices. Two years later he got out of the apartment management business outside of the New York area to concentrate on developing the commercial side of the business. 
 Most recently he spent $65 million to acquire Douglas Elliman, which has a network of offices in upscale New York suburbs and is the largest residential brokerage in Manhattan. With Douglas Elliman and Edward S. Gordon as its keystones, Insignia has announced plans to link commercial and residential operations in an effort to become a powerful real estate services presence in key corporate-headquarters cities around the globe.
"The strategy for operating the business is to become dominant in industry segments," said Mr. Farkas, who is not yet 40 years old, during an interview in his newly decorated office at 200 Park Avenue. "That's why Douglas Elliman was such a special opportunity. It enabled us to become dominant in the No. 1 market in the world."
The move of his corporate headquarters to the former Pan Am building represents something of a homecoming for Mr. Farkas, who is a native New Yorker. He built the residential management business in Greenville, S.C., because of the lower costs in that region, but shifted to New York when he disposed of that business last year.
Mr. Farkas is a son of the chairman of the former Alexander's department store chain, Robin L. Farkas, who now sits on Insignia's board.
The company's growth notwithstanding, Insignia's stock price has remained stuck in the $10 to $12 a share range in recent weeks at a time when the overall market has been soaring and after trading as high as $15.50 earlier this year. Analysts say that publicly traded real estate service companies as a group are out of favor on Wall Street for reasons that range from the inherently cyclical nature of the real estate business to a skepticism that combining dissimilar service operations will increase earnings and cash flow.
"The street either doesn't understand his strategy or it doesn't believe the parts fit together in a strategic sense," said Will Marks of Bank of America Securities. Mr. Marks also noted that Insignia has the shortest track record of its publicly traded peers, at nine years, compared to 30 to 90 years for companies such as CB Richard Ellis, Jones Lang LaSalle, Grubb & Ellis and Trammell Crow and their predecessors.
"What Insignia is trying to do has not been done at this level before," said David Harris, an analyst with Lehman Brothers. This, he said, is a problem for investors because they do not have any similar companies with which to compare Insignia's financial performance.
In an effort to create additional demand for the stock, Insignia's board authorized the repurchase of $10 million in stock in October. Last week, the company announced that $7.5 million had been spent and authorized an additional $10 million repurchase plan.
Mr. Farkas said he expects to acquire other residential brokerage companies in cities where Insignia already has commercial operations and to add services, such as providing mortgages to buyers of residential properties. Today, the company's network is composed of 49 offices in 25 states and includes 13 commercial-services companies purchased since the Gordon acquisition.
Insignia/ESG is the biggest commercial real estate services operation in the New York metropolitan area, having closed 19 of the 50 largest New York City leasing transactions last year. Nationally, it completed deals for 100 million square feet of commercial property and arranged for $3.5 billion in sales and financing in 1998.
Mr. Farkas is already established in Britain, Germany and Italy, and he said he is looking to acquire existing commercial and residential companies in other locations in Europe and Asia or start new companies where suitable acquisitions cannot be completed. "Our sights are set on major financial capitals of Europe, Asia, Canada, Latin America and elsewhere," he declared in Insignia's most recent annual report.
The point of all of this is to build a one-stop-shopping real estate company for big corporations and the people who manage them. "We want to be part of every New Yorker's personal and corporate real estate needs," he said in an interview earlier this month. "The same executives who retain us for commercial space are the ones who use Douglas Elliman to buy and sell their own co-ops and condos." And since Insignia Residential Group manages 60,000 co-op and condominium apartments in the metropolitan area, many of those living in the units are already accustomed to writing monthly checks to Insignia.
Many industry executives, however, question whether the synergies Mr. Farkas claims are made possible by combining commercial and residential operations really exist.
Julien J. Studley, chairman of the commercial brokerage company bearing his name, which specializes in representing tenants, said real estate services companies are hard to manage when they grow quickly, and called Mr. Farkas's plans "a very challenging task." Mr. Studley has maintained that real estate service companies are difficult to manage when they grow quickly.
Bruce Mosler, an executive vice president of Cushman & Wakefield, one of Insignia's major rivals on the commercial side, said that "there is not much synergy between residential and commercial because they are such different businesses."
"A lot of people are skeptical that the combination will add to their market share," Mr. Mosler said.
HE said the model for such an effort was the firm of Coldwell Banker, which added residential brokerage to its existing commercial brokerage in 1937. The company was acquired by Sears, Roebuck & Company in 1981 and Sears decided to sell the commercial-brokerage operations eight years later to a company now known as CB Richard Ellis.
"You have to question how successful it was, because Sears decided to break it up," Mr. Mosler said.
Mr. Farkas contests the analogy. "Coldwell Banker was different," he said. "It was a single brand and a single management doing both commercial and residential."
Edward S. Gordon and Douglas Elliman are different brands and different businesses that were successful independently and are now linked only by a common ownership, Mr. Farkas said. "They have completely separate systems and management and never the twain shall meet," he said. "The two businesses grew up separately and achieved dominance, and they just happened to have done it in the same market."
The importance of the brand was also emphasized by Alan Rogers, the chief executive of Douglas Elliman, who continued in his position after the company was sold to to Insignia. Douglas Elliman has more than 780 brokers, supported by a corporate staff of 100 in 15 offices. Last year it completed more than 4,100 transactions with a total value of $1.8 billion. The experience since the acquisition was announced at the end of May, he said, appears to indicate there is cross-pollination between the commercial and residential sides.
"We are keeping the Douglas Elliman name," he said. "It is a great brand that has traditionally been upscale. But more recently we have been making an effort to be all things to all people, with a cradle to grave philosophy."
He said the approach was to try to connect with young people when they first move to the city and to stay with them as they advance professionally and economically. "They will probably rent for a few years and then buy something for $400,000 or $500,000," he said. "They will probably upgrade once or twice before they finally get a big apartment to raise their family."
He said it is still not clear how the relationship with the commercial side of the company will work out in the long term, but he added: "I've been staggered over the last few weeks about the contacts we have gotten from ESG. We get calls saying, 'I've got this client, can you help him, can you help this friend?' There could be a huge opportunity."
Stephen B. Siegel, president of Insignia Financial Group, said the corporate relocations arranged by the commercial side of the business have implications for employees who will need housing. "If people are to be transferring into the tristate area we can present an analysis to management about the market and whether there is a need for incentives," he said. "We can present an entire package."
The other residential property owned by Insignia is Realty One, a Cleveland-based brokerage company specializing in single-family-home sales. Although it is the biggest such company in Ohio, and thus meets the goal of market dominance, it seems to stick out in Insignia's mix of commercial brokerage and investment operations.
Mr. Farkas said one attraction was that Realty One was advanced technically and had a mortgage banking operation, First Ohio Mortgage, that will almost certainly be added in some form to Douglas Elliman. The ability to provide mortgage loans without having to involve third-party lenders aids the brokerage business by helping to complete transactions and generates income by charging fees for the services. Like most such operations, First Ohio groups the mortgages in pools and sells them to investors.
The purchase of Realty One two years ago was intended to be the first step in an effort to consolidate the highly fragmented home brokerage business, Mr. Farkas said.
"We got Realty One in 1997 at a time when there seemed to be an opportunity to consolidate the industry into a big national franchise," he said. But after the acquisition, the price of companies in that business increased beyond what Insignia was willing to pay.
"When the pricing moved away from us we pulled in our horns and spent the last 24 months learning the business," he said. Since then, he said, the price of brokerage firms has declined, so Insignia is shopping again, with the Douglas Elliman acquisition the first addition to the grocery cart.
The price of companies like Realty One or Douglas Elliman is usually described by dividing the price by the annual income of the acquired company to produce what is known as a multiple. "We paid a lower multiple for Douglas Elliman than for Realty One," Mr. Farkas said, "so pursuing consolidation in major markets makes sense again."
Mr. Farkas, who worked on Wall Street early in his career, described Insignia as the equivalent of an opportunity fund, seeking undervalued investments and selling operations at opportune times to lock in profits.
This, he said, explains why he got into the apartment management business early in the 1990's and got out of it last year, with the exception of New York area operations.
IN the early 1990's, Insignia made investments in multifamily housing at prices the most recent annual report describes as "materially accretive to our shareholders" -- that is, cheap. The strategy then, as it continues to be, was to consolidate a fragmented industry. But by 1997 the consolidation was largely complete, with no big residential management companies left to buy. "We took the business as far as we could given our capital structure" as a taxpaying corporation, he said. "Then we looked for a company with different costs of capital -- a real estate investment trust -- to merge with."
The result was a deal with a company named AIMCO that transferred all of Insignia's residential properties and 8,000 management employees to the REIT, which does not have to pay Federal taxes as long as it distributes 95 percent of its earnings as dividends.
Insignia shareholders received AIMCO stock equivalent to 20 percent of the company in return for Insignia's residential properties and now receive dividends that Insignia, as a growth company, did not pay.
Mr. Farkas describes the deal as a good one for his company, which transferred operations accounting for about 50 percent of its business in terms of cash flow for a price -- $910 million -- that was equal to 95 percent of the company's total capitalization. AIMCO shareholders have benefited as well, since the price of the company's shares have risen from the mid-$30's to about $43 a share.
That left the restructured Insignia with three operating units, commercial real estate services, residential management in the New York area and a capital investment operation known as Insignia Financial Services.
The investment group now provides only about 2 percent of the parent company's income -- compared to 72 percent from commercial services and 26 percent from residential -- but Mr. Farkas said he expects it to be the fastest growing.
He said the commercial deals that Insignia/ESG handles provide information on potentially attractive investments.
"They provide a pipeline of investment opportunities that we can evaluate and deploy our capital alongside our customers in existing properties and in development projects," he said. For example, the company said it has invested $22 million of equity capital in 22 existing properties with a total value of $700 million and has put $18 million into five development projects with a total value of $107 million.
He said Financial Services is also raising funds on Wall Street for investments that will not show on the company's balance sheet and is participating in CS First Boston's $500 million Praedium Fund for International Real Estate. The unit is also marketing securities for property owners who prefer using public markets to other forms of financing. "We want to be an opportunistic player, like Blackstone, Blackacre and Apollo," he said, mentioning three investment groups.
Like consolidation, growth is something of a mantra for Mr. Farkas, whose largely intact management group has made over 50 acquisitions since 1990. He said the key to healthy growth is to maintain financial discipline to avoid overpaying for companies, and devise financial terms that keep previous owners hard at work. "We are not an exit strategy," he said.
Since its inception in 1990 as a real estate investment fund with $5 million in capital, Mr. Farkas said, Insignia has increased market capitalization to over $1 billion. Total revenues of the company have risen from $122 million in 1996 to $507 million in 1998, with revenues of $636 million projected for this year.
Insignia has said that the standard measure of economic performance, net income, is not appropriate for a real estate company because its merger and acquisition activity generates a lot of charges that do not actually cost the company cash.
MR. FARKAS and others in the industry prefer to measure financial performance using what is called EBITDA, earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, which they say approximates the actual cash generated by the business. By this measure, Insignia's profits have grown from $15 million in 1996 to $53 million last year.
While Insignia was expanding domestically, the company was also expanding overseas, particularly in Britain, where it bought two venerable brokerage companies and combined them into an entity called Richard Ellis St. Quintin.
(There were two companies named Richard Ellis, one based in Britain and one in the rest of Europe. An American company then called CB Commercial bought the continental Richard Ellis and promptly added it to its corporate name, becoming CB Richard Ellis. Believing the Richard Ellis brand name has considerable value in Britain, Insignia has retained it, despite the potential for confusion.)
In addition to geographic expansion, Insignia plans to begin relying heavily on technology and the Internet to improve the efficiency of marketing and transactions. Mr. Farkas declined to elaborate in detail on the techniques the company plans to start using later this year, but he playfully opened an E-mail on his desktop computer that included a movable 360-degree picture of a building lobby. And company documents note that Realty One has an automated system for preapproving mortgages.
His goal, Mr. Farkas said, is to be a customer's only real estate company. "We are not interested in one-time relationship with customers," he said. "We want to work with them and be there for them whenever they think of real estate."

HEADLINE: Hamptons' Roads Call For Changes and Concern

 BODY:
It is so distressing to me to hear the Town of Southampton speak of the traffic conditions without one mention of the dangers of Montauk Highway and County Road 39.
The town's No. 1 priority is that the residents and visitors don't get bothered by the increasing traffic, which in effect could deter them from coming to the Hamptons and possibly threaten the town's economy. 
 In 1996 there were at least five road-related deaths and in 1997 there were at least three. I use "at least" to mean only those deaths that I have heard of.
There is a heavy flow of traffic in a well-populated residential and commercial area and all the town cares about is how to increase that flow of traffic and make it move smoothly.
How about the dangers and deaths on these roads? Can cars or people cross one of these roads without putting their lives in danger? Are there a significant amount of stop lights to control speed limits? Are there any pedestrian crossings at intersections?
The answer to all those questions is no. And widening the road or any other road "improvement" that the town does will only increase the chances of more deaths.
Has the town even considered the personal safety of its residents and visitors or do they care only about their pay raise next year?

AntitrustIn the Slow Lane

BYLINE: By STEVE LOHR 

 BODY:
THE outcome of the Government's suit against Microsoft, filed 14 months ago, is still far from certain, and the endgame may be two or three years away, after appeals that may well reach the Supreme Court.
But one byproduct is already evident: a policy debate over whether the current system of antitrust enforcement, dating back to John D. Rockefeller and the railway barons, is up to the challenge of policing corporate behavior in a modern, high-technology economy. 
 The issue is speed, the stakes are high and the debate is often highly politicized. In June, Dick Armey, the House majority leader, issued his statement of principles for Government's role in an economy increasingly powered by silicon, software and the Internet. Called "An E-Contract with High-Tech America," it warned against "allowing antitrust law to become an excuse for bureaucratic interference with innovation and competition."
In a scarcely veiled reference to the Microsoft case, it criticized Federal agencies that "use heavy-handed tactics to target specific companies." And it said "the pace of innovation is so quick" that market power -- with which antitrust law concerns itself -- is often fleeting. Mr. Armey's staff says no new antitrust bill is now planned but calls the E-Contract a "starting point."
To be sure, the Armey document can be seen as a predictable gesture from a conservative Republican leader, especially as an election year looms and Microsoft is becoming a more active campaign contributor. But you don't have to side with Bill Gates to see legitimate concerns about whether the Government's antitrust police and the courts can keep up with such fast-moving industries.
A Justice Department advisory committee of executives, academics and lawyers raised that issue in a meeting last month. Committee members said the discussion was not about Microsoft, but rather about the best antitrust policies in an environment of rapid technological obsolescence. Among the options pondered were new guidelines for the Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission and "clearer, cleaner definitions" of forbidden behavior in new legislation.
The goal is up-to-date ground rules for powerful companies like Microsoft and Intel, which settled its own antitrust dispute with the F.T.C. earlier this year. "Policy-making has to be streamlined so it can operate on something closer to Internet time, as these industries do," said David B. Yoffie, a professor at Harvard Business School and a committee member.
The rapid pace of change in the software industry will not much affect the verdict on the legality of Microsoft's business practices. But when cases drag on as Microsoft's has, the speed issue weighs heavily on the remedies prosecutors seek. No ruling on Microsoft is expected from the Federal District Court in Washington before the end of the year, 18 months after the suit was filed. Again, you needn't be a Microsoft ally to notice how much has changed since the case began: Microsoft's main corporate "victim" in the case, Netscape Communications, has been acquired by America Online, and its former chief executive, James L. Barksdale, is now a venture capitalist and enthusiastic backer of George W. Bush, who, if elected President, might see antitrust policy somewhat differently than the Clinton Administration has.
THE speed issue figures prominently in the chess game of settlement discussions between Microsoft and the Government. Joel I. Klein, head of the Justice Department's antitrust division, will say only that the settlement equation is "time versus risk." A settlement would rein in Microsoft sooner than a verdict would, Mr. Klein said, but the negotiated terms might leave Microsoft enough leeway to abuse its market power.
By judicial standards, the Microsoft case has moved with surprising speed: "a remarkable achievement," according to Andrew I. Gavil, a law professor at Howard University, writing in Antitrust magazine, an American Bar Association journal. Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson, Mr. Gavil said, has used innovative tactics -- from requiring all direct testimony in writing to limiting the number of witnesses -- to speed the proceedings along and avoid the "prolonged trench warfare" that has plagued major cases like the Government's suit against I.B.M., which was dropped in 1982, after 13 years.
But even the most expeditious courts are too slow in many eyes, part of the reason so many antitrust cases are settled. "It may be fast compared with the I.B.M. case, but it's not fast enough, and that's a problem," said Carl Shapiro, an economist at the University of California at Berkeley and a former senior Justice Department official. "A lot of things do change in 18 months."

In Wine Country, Can White or Red Ever Be Green?

BYLINE: By ALAN KRAUSS 

DATELINE: ST. HELENA, Calif.

 BODY:
FARMERS and vintners in California's Napa Valley have long exploited the region's combination of soil, climate and topography to make wines that can compete with those of the great Bordeaux estates. Shrewd marketing and a robust economy have given premium Napa wines a romance and prestige that help lift sales of wine produced throughout the state.
Napa winemaking has proven so successful, in fact, that there is very little land left on the valley floor to plant new vines. To expand output, the wineries are planting on the surrounding hillsides, arousing a backlash driven by environmental concerns ranging from water pollution caused by soil erosion and pesticides to the destruction of oak trees and wildlife habitat. 
 Pushed by environmentalists, the Napa County Board of Supervisors has already enacted regulations aimed at curbing hillside vineyards, and the board's five elected members are being pressed by constituents to make the rules even more restrictive.
Winemakers say hillsides are not only the last available land for Napa vineyards but also the best land for producing world-class wine grapes -- though the most expensive to develop. At the very least, they say, the new rules would drive development costs even higher. Planting a new hillside vineyard costs $35,000 to $40,000 an acre, on top of the price of the land.
"We need to conserve habitat," said Chris Malan, a county mental health counselor who leads Concerned Citizens for Napa Hillsides, a small but politically vocal environmental group. "We need to protect our tree canopy. We need to not construct infrastructure in the hillsides that causes flooding."
Napa County's landmark 1991 hillside ordinance permits farming on slopes with grades as steep as 22.5 degrees, or 50 percent, meaning the land rises one foot for every two horizontal feet. Ms. Malan wants the county to tighten that limit to 30 percent. Better still, she said, would be a moratorium on all new vineyard development. "This is a very small county," she said. "We have to reach the limit at some point."
Because of Napa's national reputation, the fight has attracted attention from environmental groups across the country. They say they will not hesitate to intervene if measures to clean up the Napa River and protect wildlife seem inadequate.
"If it's just a matter of saying, 'We're going to do some study and crack down on future development,' then that won't solve the problem," said Bruce Hamilton, conservation director for the Sierra Club. "California, using Federal standards, classified the Napa River as impaired in 1987. If the state fails to act, then the Federal Government could step in.
"And if neither acts," he added, "then a private group like the Sierra Club could," by going to court.
Winemakers say county figures show that soil erosion has declined by more than two-thirds since 1991. "Many of us think the current ordinance is pretty damn good and the problem is enforcing it," said Dennis Groth, president of Groth Vineyards in Oakville.
The wine growers cautiously embraced recommendations by a county task force that recently evaluated Napa's hillside ordinance. The task force, whose members included winemakers and environmentalists as well as engineers and government officials, rejected proposals like a moratorium on new vineyards and extending the rules to cover replanting of existing vineyards grandfathered under the 1991 law. Instead, it called for further study.
Compliance with the law is largely voluntary; enforcement is limited to responding to the public's complaints, according to county officials. The number of vineyards that break the rules, while thought to be small, is not known.
Still, the problems that have come to light have been damaging for the winemakers. "When somebody violates the law, the finger points at all of us," said Thomas Shelton, chief executive of Joseph Phelps Vineyards and president of the Napa Vintners Association. "Enforcement of existing regulations is something we can all agree on."
Some in Napa say that planting hillsides does not make economic sense anyway.
"The issue is not growth; the issue is profit," said Volker Eisele, a vintner and grape grower with 60 acres who is also an environmental activist. "When land values and business values climb to such astronomical heights, there is a lot at stake." For what it now costs to develop hillside vineyards, he said, "to make such a venture pay, you're looking at a $60 to $80 bottle price, and I have trouble believing that you can project that kind of price into the future."
Mr. Eisele said the Napa industry should grow by increasing quality, not quantity.
For Stuart Smith, whose 30-acre Smith-Madrone Vineyards and Winery lies nearly 1,000 feet above St. Helena in the Mayacamas Range, growth is very much an issue. Mr. Smith, who is seeking county permission to convert six and a half more acres into vineyards, says modern agricultural techniques can minimize soil erosion and habitat loss. And no one should underestimate nature's resilience, he said.
He pointed to a faded redwood stake, one of many he has found on his property, that supported a grapevine more than a century ago. The tall pine trees and scrub that now surround it are evidence of the forest's regenerative vitality, he said.
"The forest wants to take back the vineyards," Mr. Smith said. "It's a constant battle for us to keep the forest at bay."

HEADLINE: With This Trip Abroad, I Thee Wed

BYLINE: By MONIQUE P. YAZIGI 

DATELINE: SINTRA, Portugal

 BODY:
IT started with a bullfight and ended with a lot of investment bankers and fashion designers skinny-dipping in the hotel pool.
In between, statuesque women wrapped in pashmina shawls teetered in Manolo Blahniks on the cobblestone streets of this scenic coastal city built by Portuguese kings and queens for their summer palaces. 
 There were ponies with hydrangeas woven into their manes, flamenco dancing, a series of all-night parties and bottles of Chateau Lafite brought by members of the Rothschild family from their own vineyards.
Those were some of the highlights when John Josephson, 37, an investment banker, and Carolina Zapf, 30, a porcelain-skinned dress designer, invited 220 of their nearest and dearest to cross the Atlantic Ocean to their wedding, a five-day fandango over the Fourth of July weekend.
The couple, both New Yorkers, have no family in Portugal, nor have they ever lived there; they simply wanted an unusual and exotic location, and in this day of casual jet travel -- not to mention a galloping economy -- the extravagance of going to Europe for a long-weekend wedding did not seem far-fetched. A number of guests, including the bridegroom, who specializes in movie-industry deals, were traveling directly from Portugal to Sun Valley, Idaho, for the annual conference of media and entertainment chieftains given by Allen & Company, the investment firm.
"Who wants to go to another wedding at the Pierre?" said Mr. Josephson, whose mother, Arlette Brisson, wore a James Galanos gown, a gift from the designer, to the ceremony, and changed three times during the 12-hour reception. Mr. Josephson, in a morning coat, got a kick out of showing off the pockets in the tails, where he stashed his gloves.
Mr. Josephson and Ms. Zapf are not alone in marrying abroad. This is the summer of the European wedding for certain New Yorkers willing to pay a minimum of $100,000 for a multi-day splurge for hundreds of guests. At a chateau near Paris over the Memorial Day weekend, Nathalie Gerschel, a special events coordinator at Christie's, wed Edward Kaplan, an executive at Showtime Networks, before 400 friends, including members of Manhattan's junior social set like Whitney Fairchild, Sloan Lindemann and Rob Speyer.
In June, Jamie Saslow, a former retail sales consultant, and David Mitchell, an investment banker, were married in the Spanish Synagogue in the historic Jewish Ghetto in Venice with 160 guests, who were transported by private vaporettos and water taxis to nine events in four days, requiring two party planners from Milan.
And also over Fourth of July weekend, Cynthia Kaufman, who used to work in sales at Donna Karan, and Henry Gabay, an investment banker, were married before 350 in Istanbul, Turkey.
Jill Swid, an editor at Mirabella magazine, who was invited to both the Istanbul wedding and the one in Portugal, had the difficult task of choosing between them. "Cynthia is one of my closest friends," she said. That sealed her decision to go to Istanbul, where festivities began at an open-air nightclub on Wednesday, continued with sightseeing on Friday and peaked at the Saturday ceremony in a restored Ottoman palace overlooking the Bosporus.
"I haven't figured out why there is the European wedding craze," Ms. Swid said, "but there is. Europeans say, 'Our weddings last for days.' But there can be three-day weddings in New York or Southampton. The difference is you're on holiday, I guess."
Others are more confident in offering reasons for the trend. "A lot of this has to do with the economy," said Polly Onet, the event planner, who did the 1996 wedding of David and Julia Koch in Southampton, N.Y., and last year organized a wedding for New Yorkers in Dublin. "I think people in high society get very bored. In order to challenge them and make things very special and spectacular, it takes bringing them to a completely new environment in order to blow their minds. You want to make them feel like it's special, rather than just another wedding at the Colony Club."
Many of those marrying or receiving invitations, which invariably are accompanied by pages of travel instructions, belong to the loosely interlocking worlds of charity parties, investment banking and fashion.
"A lot of these people are on the same wedding circuit," noted Alexandra Kotur, a senior editor at Vogue, who has been to three weddings of New Yorkers this summer in Europe. The grandest joined Valesca Dost and Mathias Guerrand-Hermes, an heir to the French fashion house, who lives in New York. The wedding started with more than 450 guests on May 12 in Paris and ended five days later in Marrakech, Morocco, with guests transported by two private jets.
Alexandra Lind, a young fashion designer, went to the Kaufman-Gabay wedding in Istanbul, the Gerschel-Kaplan wedding in Paris (she designed the blue satin dresses for the bridesmaids), and plans to attend a wedding over Labor Day weekend for Victoria Scaravilli, a real estate agent on the Upper East Side, and Owen Colligan, an investment banker, in Capri, Italy.
Mr. Colligan and Ms. Scaravilli were themselves at the Portugal wedding. "When I told my family we were getting married in Capri, they thought we were nuts," Mr. Colligan said, as he ate a slice of wedding cake at 1:30 A.M. in the Palacio de Seteais, an 18th-century palace-turned-hotel, where many of the guests stayed and the reception was held. "And Princess Di over there," he said, gesturing to his fiancee, who was wrapped in pink pashmina, "wants 12 bridesmaids. So, I had to find 12 ushers who will go with me."
Katrina Pavlos, a guest in Portugal, who has been invited to four European weddings this summer, cried out, "Please, stop, I can't afford it!"
"I feel like I have to go to all of them," said Ms. Pavlos, 26, a filmmaker, as she sipped Champagne. "They're your friends. But I'm broke by now."
Ms. Onet estimated that the weddings cost the hosts, who often fly in their own bands and a minister or rabbi to officiate, anywhere from $100,000 to several million. This contrasts with a wedding at the Pierre Hotel in New York, which for 200 can run about $125,000 and up, including flowers, photographers, tips and taxes, said Arthur Backal, the director of catering at the hotel.
Guests invited to the Portugal wedding, who paid their own air fare and lodging, said they spent from $2,500 to $4,000, not including a gift, numerous clothing changes (during the wedding reception alone, many of the women changed several times, moving from cocktail dresses to ball gowns) and, in some cases, the expense of a nanny brought from home.
Ms. Onet said that clearly, there is an element of one-upmanship in the weddings. "By having an extremely over-the-top, lavish event abroad, people want to impress, make a statement and outshine the last party," she said.
The 1990's jet-set wedding may have been sparked for the current generation by the well-publicized foreign ceremonies of two daughters of the billionaire Robert Miller. In 1993, Pia Miller married Christopher Getty in Bali, where Balinese carried the couple on thrones. Three years later, Marie-Chantal Miller married Crown Prince Pavlos of Greece in England before 1,100 guests; Valentino designed 27 couture dresses for the bridal party, and Barry Diller flew in the wedding cake on his private plane.
Darcy Miller, the weddings editor for Martha Stewart Weddings magazine (and not one of those Miller sisters), said, "Since the magazine started in 1995, we've seen so many more destination weddings, which is going somewhere for your wedding where you do not live and no one else lives."
Some couples marry abroad, Ms. Miller said, as a way of paring down the guest list without bruising feelings. They expect the travel expense will deter all but their closest (and most affluent) friends. But they quickly find out, she said, that people love to travel. More than 70 percent of the invitees showed up for the Josephson-Zapf wedding, some of whom didn't commit until the last minute.
"I turn my head and a new person I didn't know was coming arrives," Ms. Zapf said the day before the ceremony, wearing navy jodhpurs and a white shirt on the terrace of her hotel. She shrugged. "I don't know who else is going to show up."
"I'm not going to think about it," she said, and went off horseback riding to relax.
"Being abroad, it creates an automatic buzz about the wedding itself," said Michelle Halpern, 28, who works in film publicity for Peggy Siegal and attended the Istanbul wedding.
Of course it does. The partying never stops. David Schulhof, 28, a lawyer at Miramax Films, who attended the Gerschel-Kaplan wedding, said that on the first night there was a cocktail party on a bateau-mouche on the Seine.
"In the evening we raged at different nightclubs," he said. "We went to Les Bains Douches, Bar Fly and Le Cabaret."
Even though Mr. Guerrand-Hermes, whose family is French, could claim he was simply returning home to be married outside Paris in mid-May, and thus his wedding was not such an extravagance, the event was the most lavish this season to which New Yorkers were invited in droves.
On the first night, guests were instructed to wear stiletto heels and slicked-back hair to a flamenco-themed party. The wedding the next day took place on an Hermes estate in Chantilly, where a New England-style church had been constructed for the ceremony. Then, guests were flown by private planes to Marrakech. Over the next three days, there were a party in the gardens of Yves Saint Laurent's home, and polo on camelback.
"Everyone felt like a pasha, it was from another era," said Kristina Stewart, the editor in chief of Quest magazine, who attended. On the second-to-last night, she said she told the bridegroom, "If you want to outdo yourself you're going to have to come up with a Kelly bag for every guest and a virgin sacrifice tomorrow night." There were no Kelly bags, but guests were sent home with a custom-made Hermes scarf.
By contrast, the Josephson-Zapf fete in Sintra was more modest -- though only relatively. There was a high quotient of Internet entrepreneurs, including Jon Diamond, the chairman of CDNow, the on-line music retailer, and David Wetherell, the chairman of the venture capital company CMGI, which just before he flew in had paid $2.03 billion for control of the Web search engine Alta Vista. The front-desk manager of the converted castle where many guests stayed received daily piles of faxes in advance with all sorts of special requests, including one for a T1 high-speed data line. (He had no idea what it was.)
Yet, what celebrants repeatedly praised as the charm of a multi-day wedding in Portugal was the way busy, competitive people let down their guard. The social angling familiar to many from weekends in the Hamptons was largely absent. "If you take people out of their element, it works," Mr. Josephson said.
Gordon R. Pennington, a marketing strategist, surveyed the guests dancing in a moonlighted garden the night before the wedding and said: "Half these people wouldn't talk to each other if they were sitting in the Hamptons. When you take them out of the country, in a place they've never been to, it takes their edge off."
At 2:30 A.M. the following night, Bradley Lander's eyes were barely open, but he was unwilling to call it quits. "When are you going to be playing in Sintra again?" he said, and got up to dance, missing a few steps, with a scantily clad woman who tossed her lime-green shawl in the grass to join him.
Earlier, at cocktails, another man had said, "It's chic to say you went to Portugal for the weekend." Moments before he was joined by his date, whom he had escorted from New York, he added, "It's a great way to impress a girl and take her on a test drive at the same time."

HEADLINE: PORTFOLIOS, ETC.;
A Second Look at Second-Quarter Forecasts

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER 

 BODY:
EXPECTATIONS are pretty high as the second-quarter earnings season gets into full swing this week, with reports scheduled from Intel, Apple Computer, International Paper, Merrill Lynch, Pfizer, Whirlpool, Weyerhaeuser and others.
Wall Street analysts who make forecasts for the 500 companies in the Standard & Poor's stock index are predicting the first double-digit growth in quarterly corporate earnings since the end of 1997. I.B.E.S. International, which tracks earnings, is forecasting 10 percent overall growth, based on its compilation of analysts' predictions, while the First Call Corporation, the other leading compiler of earnings, predicts 11.2 percent. 
 Adding to the optimism is the gentleness of the pre-announcement season, often a rocky run-up when many companies warn investors of profit disappointments to come. There have been 270 negative announcements so far, according to First Call; that total is no worse than normal. The only "blockbuster announcement," said Chuck Hill, the director of research at First Call, was Compaq Computer's warning in June that it expected a second-quarter loss of as much as 15 cents a share.
In addition, the number of downward revisions of analysts' earnings estimates, which commonly occur before the beginning of a reporting season, has been smaller than normal for the second quarter. The current First Call forecast of 11.2 percent earnings growth, compared with the second quarter last year, is down from 13.9 percent six months ago. That is a much smaller cut than in the first quarter of this year, when the initial 14.3 percent forecast was slashed to 5.7 percent. A trim of four percentage points is the norm, Mr. Hill said.
And companies that have already reported earnings, including General Electric, Yahoo and Alcoa, have provided good news.
All of this has led Mr. Hill to suggest that by the time all the second-quarter reports are in, the actual jump in earnings, compared with the second quarter of 1998, will be closer to 15 percent.
The strength of the numbers is reassuring in a period when interest rates could move higher. The Federal Reserve, which has already raised rates once, could raise them again later this summer.
The good earnings prospects (analysts think that the third and fourth quarters will be even stronger) also help investors live with the fact that prices are high for many stocks, by historical standards. According to I.B.E.S, stocks have been too pricey for 29 consecutive weeks, the longest overvaluation streak since before the 1987 crash.
But remember that a lot of the punch in the earnings numbers is not from a new surge in growth, but from a rebound from setbacks -- or even sharp losses -- in 1998.
For example, General Motors, according to I.B.E.S. estimates, will show a surge in operating earnings in the second quarter, to $2.55 a share, compared with 54 cents a share in the corresponding period last year. (Operating earnings are adjusted to remove the impact of write-offs and other one-time items and are therefore different from reported earnings.)
But the G.M. gain represents mostly a rebound from sales lost during a strike that crippled production last year. Before cutting estimates because of the strike, analysts expected G.M. to earn $2.27 a share in last year's second quarter. Without G.M.'s sharp expected gain, the overall I.B.E.S. second-quarter growth forecast would drop to 8.6 percent from 10 percent, according to Joseph Abbott, United States research manager.
Intel is also expected to rebound, to operating earnings of 54 cents a share, from 33 cents in the period a year earlier, when chip prices were being cut. Without Intel and G.M., the I.B.E.S. growth forecast would be cut to 8 percent.
Easy quarterly comparisons also help in the next two quarters. G.M. is expected to surge again. And with oil prices 47 percent above the average for the last two quarters of 1998, energy sector profits, according to First Call, should jump 39 percent in the third quarter and 77 percent in the fourth.
Banks and brokerage firms also ought to do well in the third quarter, compared with the disastrous results during the financial turmoil that followed the Russian ruble devaluation and bond default last August.
So don't get too excited about the return to double-digit profit increases.

HEADLINE: A Son Rises In Texas;
Ross Perot Jr., the Builder, Puts His Stamp on Dallas

BYLINE: By ALLEN R. MYERSON 

DATELINE: DALLAS

 BODY:
WHEN it comes to dynasties, Gov. George W. Bush has said that his father's idea of the perfect son was Al Gore. Ross Perot's idea of the perfect son is Ross Perot Jr.
Lest Ross Jr. have any doubts about what was expected of him, his father wrote it all down. At his college graduation, Ross Sr. presented him with "Everything I Know About Business," a treatise that later filled 62 pages in the elder Perot's autobiography. "Avoid undertaking new projects on a grand scale," it advised -- at least until after completing some low-risk trials. 
 Two decades later, Ross Jr. has become the leading real estate developer in a state where builders can wield more power than governors or mayors. And now he is bending some of his father's rules as he sets out to transform a swath of downtown Dallas the size of about 19 Manhattan blocks into office buildings, apartments, shopping concourses and a sports arena that, he boasts, will give this city its own Times Square.
"I'd better go back and read the guidelines," the younger Mr. Perot said with his usual purposeful frown, sitting in an office down the hall from his father's, both of them behind locked and guarded doors. "You're going to get me in trouble."
Not to worry. Though he is in a different trade than his father, who built a fortune with one computer services company and has now gone public with another, Mr. Perot has proved himself his father's son in recognizing government as the businessman's best patron.
As his father built his first company, Electronic Data Systems, on winning government contracts, the son has built his real estate empire on winning all manner of government support.
His latest project has been based on persuading Dallas voters -- usually stingy with public money -- that they should pay $125 million of the $230 million cost for his basketball team's new arena, the anchor for a billion-dollar-plus real estate development.
It has taken Donald Trump 24 years to finish two buildings on the site of Manhattan's West Side rail yards, a tract of about the same size. In Dallas, Mr. Perot had the dirt flying just two years after he bought the Dallas Mavericks of the National Basketball Association in 1996 and a year after his initial downtown investments.
Touring the site in his black Chevrolet Suburban, his top aides filling its three benches, Mr. Perot bounced over curbs, across abandoned railroad tracks and past derelict grain elevators, avidly describing everything he plans -- down to pasting corporate logos on the overpasses.
"There are some neat naming opportunities on the bridges," he told his assistants. "Tastefully done."
MR. PEROT has the ready ability to turn his dreams into steel, concrete and glass. In a business usually run on other people's money, he uses large amounts of his own, gathered from earlier real estate investments that he made with his father.
His successes have had a deeply personal benefit. Even four or five years ago, questions about how much his father's money and connections had contributed to his own progress drew pinched responses. His father was only an investor, Mr. Perot would say, while full, legal, decision-making authority rested with him.
Now, with less to prove, Mr. Perot can warmly describe childhood weekends spent looking over real estate with his father. Or, for all the unwanted attention of being a Perot, the considerable benefits that the name carries. "The key thing is certainly you can go see people," he said. "They'll take your phone calls."
Congenital determination, as well as money, may allow Mr. Perot to bring the ailing center of this city a revival that has been beyond the abilities of anyone else. To buy the Mavericks, he had to muscle aside Thomas O. Hicks, Dallas's own leveraged-buyout king. Even though Mr. Hicks said he could build an arena for a city investment of just $40 million or $50 million, Mr. Perot persuaded civic leaders to allot about three times as much. Mr. Hicks and Mr. Perot became partners in the project, although Mr. Perot remained the developer.
His headstrong ways have decisively shaped his image. No other Texas builder is so eagerly courted or publicly reviled. To those who have opposed the arena or his other vast projects, he is a ruthless privateer intent on raiding the public's purse.
Early last year in Dallas, Mr. Perot and Mr. Hicks spent $2 million to gain voter approval of arena subsidies. An opposition group calling itself "It's a Bad Deal" spent just $75,000 but came within 1,700 votes of winning. The group's members continue to shadow Mr. Perot. "This guy is the biggest welfare baby the public has ever seen," Sharon Boyd, the group's leader and a former member of the Dallas Planning Commission, said months after the vote. "What has he ever done without public assistance? His daddy built his own company with public assistance."
Mr. Perot responds that the jobs and tax revenues produced by his projects far exceed any public costs. And, as he coolly told other developers last fall at the annual meeting of the Urban Land Institute here, braving opposition is his duty.
"Half of this business is politics," he said, in a measured corporate monotone that contrasts with his father's buzz-saw twang. "As real estate developers, it's our job to go in there and get beat up."
His father, back at Perot Systems after two Presidential campaigns, remains a walking editorial cartoon, a rambunctious runt with a tomahawk profile. The son, at 5 feet 11 inches, has conventional broad-shouldered good looks -- as perfectly pressed, meticulously slicked back and emotionally composed as if he had rumbled loose from a marble monument to Texas deal-makers.
The older Mr. Perot argues that a Texas habit -- calling the father "Big" and the son "Little" when they share a given name -- shouldn't apply to him and his son. "He's Big Ross and I'm Old Ross, and there's no better place to live than in your son's shadow," he says.
In politics, however, the younger Mr. Perot, apart from favoring free trade, stays out of his father's way. Recalling the uproar over his 1992 donation to President Bush's re-election campaign before his father joined the race, he has refused to back Governor Bush's Presidential campaign until his father's plans are clear. "I've learned my lessons," Mr. Perot said. "I'm staying on the sidelines for Dad." (Dad, while saying he prefers business to politics, won't rule out another race.)
At 40, Big Ross is less exciting than his father but also less excitable -- a reflection of the influence of his mother, Margot, family friends say. As the oldest of five children and the only son, one friend said, "Ross Jr. was trained for, conditioned for being in the public eye."
It was not your normal childhood. His father, an Annapolis graduate, surrounded his son with military heroes, former prisoners of war and astronauts. The son distinguished himself as an Air Force fighter pilot and later as the lead pilot on the first helicopter trip around the world. Such training is the best business school, the elder Mr. Perot contends, saying, "When you're flying a fighter, you don't have time for committee meetings."
He needs no prompting to tell how he offered his son, then about 14 years old, 75 cents for each bush he would plant along the road in front of the old E.D.S. headquarters in Dallas. Just inches into the ground, Ross Jr. struck rock. Rejecting his father's offer to adjust the price, Ross went at the task with a pickax. Now, his father says, "Anytime he buys a piece of real estate, he checks to see where the rock is."
And how did he rebel? Anything like George W. Bush's wild living in earlier days? The younger Mr. Perot throws back his head and laughs with rare abandon. "It wasn't really part of the program in the Perot family," he says. "Rebellion was not an option."
Instead, friends say, he was driven to make his own mark, to give the lie to anyone who dared say that all his advantages were inherited.
Still, he assumed that he would work for his father. He started out as a land man, leasing drilling rights for his father's oil company. He planned to become an E.D.S. salesman, but in 1984 his father sold the company to General Motors. He decided to turn his family's real estate holdings into the basis of a business, the Hillwood Development Corporation.
With his father's help, he began buying thousands of acres north of Fort Worth, counting on the city's continuing sprawl to turn ranches and farms dotted with post oaks and mesquite into subdivisions and shopping malls. The city, anticipating added tax revenue and jobs, was happy to annex his land and provide services.
Though the collapse of the Texas economy in the late 1980's dashed the Perots' initial plans, they still had the cash to buy thousands of additional acres from desperate sellers. But Ross Jr.'s new plan -- to build an air cargo hub to be called Alliance Airport -- required help from government at all levels. After a tour in the Hillwood helicopter, Jim Wright of Fort Worth, then the Speaker of the House and a prime beneficiary of the Perots' campaign donations, pushed a bill through Congress for a far larger project than the Federal Aviation Administration had recommended. Federal, state and local governments provided more than $200 million in cash and tax breaks.
Local real estate experts estimate that after some early reversals, Mr. Perot has gained hundreds of millions of dollars turning his Fort Worth property into the Southwest's largest hub for cargo shipments. "Alliance was Ross's E.D.S.," said Tom Luce, a Dallas lawyer and political adviser for father and son.
Mr. Perot raised his bet on the area when he bought the 2,500-acre Circle T Ranch in 1993 for less than $20 million from a desperate, bankrupt Nelson Bunker Hunt, who had once insisted that he wouldn't part with it even for $200 million. Mr. Perot, then 34, talked of building a whole new city there, with thousands of office workers, golfers, shoppers and residents.
But the ranch was in Westlake, a hamlet of 250 affluent residents who had moved to the country to escape traffic and crowds.
For Mr. Perot, though, not even lines on a map are unalterable. And so the Westlake aldermen ousted a mayor antagonistic to him and then gave up two-thirds of the town's property, including the Circle T. In a special Saturday meeting, the Fort Worth City Council, eager for development, declared the land Fort Worth's. Amid ensuing lawsuits, it was unclear just who was the Westlake Mayor and which city or town could claim the Circle T.
AT the same time, Mr. Perot was turning back to Dallas. Pointing out his office window in North Dallas at the office park where his father had built E.D.S. and then, in the early 1980's, tried to expand, Mr. Perot delivered a short sermon. "The neighborhood groups did not want Dad to fill out the campus," he said, and the city sided with the neighbors. "That's when Dad left Dallas."
Left -- and started an exodus, to the northern suburb of Plano. The elder Mr. Perot bought land that accommodated several newcomers, starting with E.D.S. "Then another Dallas company, Frito-Lay, then Fina, then Dr Pepper moved to Plano," Ross Jr. said.
By the mid-1990's, Dallas's leaders presided over one of the nation's deadest downtowns -- so dead that even Dallas Mayor Ron Kirk, gazing out his own office window, couldn't resist saying, "You go on a tour of downtown and its attractions now, and you ask, 'What can we do with the other 45 minutes of the hour?' "
Decades earlier, Mr. Perot's father had said he would never run for public office or buy a sports team. But Ross Jr. figured that if an airport could cause the value of the surrounding land to soar, why not an arena?
In early 1996, he bought a 67 percent stake in the Mavericks for $125 million, bluntly declaring that he was in the game for the real estate, not love of the sport. "A lot of people look at a basketball team as an anchor tenant for an arena," he said in announcing the purchase. "I look at an arena as the anchor tenant for a much larger program."
But first, he wanted to persuade the city to pay up and the state to let the city raise its taxes for that purpose. The Texas Legislature, by approving a measure letting Dallas raise its car rental and hotel taxes, allowed backers to say that the cost would fall only on city visitors.
When the city then balked at Mr. Perot's demand that it pay more than half of the arena costs, he took to the air in his company's Bell L-3 helicopter. He carried one suburban mayor after another to view possible arena sites in their towns. He encouraged television helicopters to follow, giving their pilots his radio frequency so that if cameramen missed a shot, he could swoop in again.
"It was just like an Air Force mission," he said.
Mayor Kirk, pressured earlier to avoid giveaways, was now under pressure to make a deal. "Either way, the voters were going to scream at you," he recalled. "But you didn't want to be a mayor that let a team walk away from a city that still hasn't gotten over losing the Cowboys 25 years ago." He agreed for the city to pay $125 million and the team owners just $105 million. In January 1998, voters just barely approved the deal.
To guide his development plans, Mr. Perot visited 25 cities from Shanghai to Berlin and consulted with Edward P. Bass, the Bass brother who led his family in reviving Fort Worth's downtown. Setting his usual high-pressure deadline, Mr. Perot gave five architecture firms only four weeks to submit designs, though most competitions take months.
At the deadline, the architects, gathered at a downtown business club, all had tales of working every day and many nights. When Mr. Perot told Ricardo Legorreta, Mexico's best-known architect, that the competition was great fun, Mr. Legorreta grinned and answered, "More fun for you than it is for us."
Mr. Perot's chose David M. Schwarz of Washington and Fort Worth over Helmut Jahn and other international stars. Mr. Schwarz, whose nostalgic designs have made him royal architect to the Bass family, proposed an updated brick-and-glass version of a college field house. Mr. Perot says the final design, to be revealed as soon as this week, will be substantially different.
The arena will be called the American Airlines Center, with the airline's $190 million payment over 30 years going to the team owners, not to the city. Mr. Perot has dubbed his whole project Victory, a name he announced at a news conference where a film and brochure compared his ambitions to those of Churchill, among others. His design requirements include a victory balcony where athletes can wave their trophies to crowds below.
The balcony is far more likely to accommodate Mr. Hicks's hockey team, the Dallas Stars, which won the Stanley Cup last month, than Mr. Perot's Mavericks, with a record of 19 wins and 31 losses in this year's shortened season. Mr. Perot points out that his team (20-62 the year before) is improving.
Mr. Perot and Mr. Hicks are on the verge of extending their partnership to the full Victory development, with Mr. Hicks saying that he plans to buy a 50 percent interest.
IN Fort Worth, meanwhile, Mr. Perot's plans for the Circle T have come up against officials weary of his muscular tactics. Fidelity Investments wanted to build a 300-acre office park for 2,700 employees but posed one condition: settlement of the feud with Westlake, so the company would know what municipality it would be in. With Westlake having become more receptive, Mr. Perot asked Fort Worth to kindly drop all the Circle T claims he had once encouraged, arguing that the city would still benefit from development in a neighboring town.
At that, Fort Worth's leaders reached their limits. They demanded that Mr. Perot repay the city's legal fees and provide other compensation. After the city blithely let some Perot-imposed deadlines pass, Mr. Perot agreed to build a job training center and buy water supplies from Fort Worth for 30 years.
Dallas, too, expects him to do more than build his brick-and-mortar fortune. A grateful Mayor Kirk has challenged him to take as much responsibility for his city as the Basses of Fort Worth have taken for theirs. "Ross Perot, with his wealth and experience and family," he said, "can do things for Dallas that nobody else can do."

Through Hillwood Development, Ross Perot Jr., below, has become the largest real estate developer in Texas, and he is reaching beyond its borders as well. Government connections have, at times, been crucial to Mr. Perot's success, as they were for his father's original business, Electronic Data Systems.

HEADLINE: Jumping Off the Bandwidth Wagon

BYLINE: By SETH SCHIESEL 

 BODY:
IN a dingy warren of cables and wires on Manhattan's Upper East Side, phone calls are starting to look a lot like pork bellies.
There, in his cramped office above the Pulse Night Club, Alex Mashinsky, 33, has created an electronic trading floor for telephone service that resembles nothing so much as the international market for traditional commodities. 
 Communications carriers from around the world, including giants like AT&T and Nippon Telegraph and Telephone, link to the Web site for Mr. Mashinsky's company, Arbinet Communications, to trade unused long-distance telephone minutes from New York to every corner of the globe. On Friday, a minute to Israel sold for as little as 8.4 cents, a minute to Hong Kong as little as 4.6 cents.
Although it is tempting to hold up Arbinet as a creator of a new communications landscape, in fact it is only a stark symptom of a much larger shift in the electronic world: While consumers and regulators focus on the communications bottleneck in the so-called last mile of wire to homes and businesses, long-distance communications capacity -- or "bandwidth," a hot buzzword of the Information Moment -- is fast becoming a commodity.
Deregulation, rapid advances in optical technology and generous capital markets have combined to create an explosion in communications supply -- a supply that exceeds even the surging demands in communications unleashed by the Internet. Accordingly, long-distance prices are falling sharply. On Friday, AT&T sold its biggest business customers a minute of telephone time to Israel for 35.4 cents, less than a third of the cost three years ago, and a minute to Hong Kong for 27.2 cents, down 57 percent. The big gap between the retail marketplace and spot markets like Arbinet's cannot last for long.
More significantly, for the companies and investors alike, margins in some parts of the communications business are following suit, as long-distance bandwidth for both telephone and data services turns from scarce to plentiful.
The shift is driving many of the strategy reversals and multibillion-dollar deals that have become almost commonplace in the industry. It explains AT&T's burst into the cable television business and the continuing, soap-opera-like bidding war between Qwest Communications International and Global Crossing for the Frontier Corporation and U S West.
At the same time, the fierce competition in the long-distance arena only highlights its relative absence in local markets. That, in turn, reinforces the almost overarching value of local communications networks -- and is prompting some investors to rethink their portfolios for the digital future.
 
A New Profit Formula
The changes in the long-distance industry are undermining what is perhaps the fundamental rule of telecommunications economics -- that margins stick to assets.
After AT&T began to face significant competition about two decades ago, it became clear that long-term profits in the business stemmed largely from controlling physical assets like fiber optic lines, copper wires and communications switches. For years, the cost of running a network was a big part, perhaps a third or more, of running a communications business. A major component of making money was keeping the continuing network costs low, and the main way to do so was to own the network.
That is one reason Sprint emerged from a venture of the Southern Pacific Railroad, which could use its railroad rights-of-way to lay fiber-optic lines. It also explains MCI's original name, Microwave Communications Inc.; by using microwave links it had developed, MCI could provide long-distance services for less than AT&T. (MCI eventually built its own fiber optic network, to help the company compete more broadly.)
Most of the hundreds of other new long-distance companies that emerged after the 1984 breakup of AT&T, however, leased communications capacity from others, and few have had consistent profits and growth.
Drawing from that experience, new companies like Qwest, Level 3 Communications, Global Crossing, IXC Communications and the communications units of the Williams Companies and Enron, two energy giants, have been founded -- and financed -- on the logic that owning physical assets was essential. Each of the companies is building a new fiber optic long-distance network, some in the United States and some globally. Combined, the first three have raised or borrowed more than $10 billion over the last three years, mainly to build their new networks. At the same time, new optical technologies have been expanding the capacity of existing networks by factors of 16 and 32, with a potential of 160.
To grasp just how much bandwidth is being created, consider this: According to Telegeography Inc., a research firm in Washington, in 1997 the world's public telephone networks carried 81.8 billion minutes, or 155,632 years, worth of international phone calls. The newest optical systems can transmit the digital equivalent of all of those calls over a single fiber in about 11 days.
Hence the new carriers' predicament: Their investments are alleviating the very scarcity that made their original business plans so attractive.
The problem is not that a glut of bandwidth has been created. It is clear that new, bandwidth-hungry services will fill all of the available communications pipes. However, the big profits in the industry are migrating away from raw bandwidth and toward the applications that use it.
An early sign of how prices would turn volatile as bandwidth supply played leapfrog with demand was in the market for T-3 Internet lines, which can carry 45 million bits of digital information a second.
When they first became widely available in 1995, the lines sometimes cost less than $20,000 a month; buyers included corporate customers and Internet service providers. But as the use of the Internet exploded, demand outpaced supply, and prices shot as high as $70,000 a month in early 1996.
Since then, however, prices have fallen consistently, by about 10 percent a year, as new and existing carriers have built up their networks. T-3 lines now cost about $50,000 a month, and many in the industry expect the trend to continue or even accelerate.
"People have been thinking about bandwidth from a Malthusian standpoint: 'How do I ration this?' " said Daniel Smith, chief executive of Sycamore Networks, a communications equipment company, whose previous business, Cascade Communications, another equipment maker, was bought by Ascend Communications in 1997 for $3.7 billion. "And now we're saying, 'How do we think about this from a standpoint of plenty?' "
Many of the nation's communications carriers have come up with an answer: They need to evolve up the digital food chain -- from mere bandwidth suppliers to providers of advanced services -- to maintain their profit margins in the future. They are scrambling to acquire direct links to homes and offices -- not for the assets per se, but because in the next century, margins in the communications business will stick to services and customers.
"If anything, the cost of communications is falling faster than the cost of computing, so assume unlimited bandwidth," said Howard Anderson, managing director of the Yankee Group, a technology consulting firm in Boston. In that case, he said, "you are either the application service innovator, or you're dead meat."
 
Moving to Plan B
The shift has shred business plans across the industry and helped fuel the paroxysm of takeovers reshaping the communications landscape.
AT&T provides a classic example. Many strategic subcurrents have been at work behind AT&T's $90 billion leap into the cable TV business, from a need to protect its long-distance base to the simple desire to shake the company out of a torpor. But at the root has been a quest for sustainable profits, and the brain trust at AT&T's headquarters in Basking Ridge, N.J., decided that such profits were not to be found merely in the long-distance business.
Having a long-distance network is "a necessary, but not sufficient, condition to succeed in the future," said Frank Ianna, president of AT&T's network unit. Instead, AT&T concluded that it again needed to connect directly to its customers. "That's where there's the least amount of competition," he explained, referring to local markets, "and that's where you have the ability to differentiate from your competition."
AT&T is betting that owning cable lines directly into customers' homes will allow it to deliver interactive television, high-speed Internet services and local phone service -- all products that should support higher margins than its core long-distance service.
MCI Worldcom, the No. 2 long-distance provider, after AT&T, has almost the same philosophy, but with a focus on serving business customers. It, too, sees its future in services and applications, not simply bandwidth. And it also wants to own the direct link to the customer.
"Our story is very different from offering raw capacity," said John W. Sidgmore, vice chairman of MCI Worldcom.
In Worldcom's evolution from communications nobody to industry titan over the last decade, the company's deal to acquire MFS Communications in 1996 looks at least as important strategically as its acquisition of MCI last year. The MFS deal gave Worldcom not only direct, local fiber optic links to business customers, but also the Uunet Internet operation run by Mr. Sidgmore. Uunet, coupled with MCI's corporate data communications operation, is now driving MCI Worldcom's growth, by developing the advanced data applications, like intranets, demanded by big business customers and delivering them worldwide.
Since MCI and Worldcom announced their merger in the fall of 1997, telephone service revenue has dropped from 68 to 61 percent of the combined company's overall sales, while Internet and corporate data services have grown from 22 percent to 30 percent. In the first quarter of 1999, telephone service revenue increased only 7 percent over the comparable 1998 period, while data services sales grew 30 percent and Internet revenue 60 percent.
At Qwest, the shift in focus toward the top of the food chain has happened in fast-forward, and some investors have found it unsettling.
When the company first offered shares to the public in 1997, it was seen on Wall Street as a bandwidth play. Investors expected Qwest to concentrate on using the latest technology to build a long-distance network with more, and cheaper, capacity than those of companies like AT&T or MCI, letting the upstart take market share away from slower, less-advanced competitors.
Over the last year, though, Qwest has repositioned itself as -- surprise! -- a provider of advanced communications services for end users. This year alone, Qwest has announced partnerships with companies including KPMG, BellSouth, Siebel Systems, SAP America, Hewlett-Packard, Oracle and Automatic Data Processing's Brokerage Services unit to develop high-margin applications like software for sales forces, aimed at various market segments//cut for space.
And now, Qwest is making an unsolicited run at acquiring Frontier, a long-distance company that also owns Globalcenter, one of the biggest Web-hosting concerns, and U S West, the regional Bell company based in Denver. U S West is the slowest-growing Bell, but it still has millions of customers, whom Qwest needs for the new services it is developing.
Qwest is trying to wrench Frontier and U S West from the grasp of another erstwhile bandwidth play, Global Crossing. While both Qwest and Global Crossing have made cases for why their deals make sense, their sudden transformations have left some investors scratching their heads.
"It's created confusion," said Eric Strumingher, an analyst at Paine Webber. "Qwest and Global Crossing have represented themselves as growth companies, as nimble companies based on modern technology and that had the most flexibility. Now they're attempting to combine with a company that was not representing itself like that, and is in fact not like that. That is the big source of the indigestion."
 
Divergent Philosophies
To James Q. Crowe, perhaps the most prominent executive still carrying the flag for the pure bandwidth strategy, this is all tantamount to heresy.
Mr. Crowe is chief executive of Level 3, which is building a national fiber optic communications network based on Internet systems and the latest optical technology. Mr. Crowe says he has no intention of selling advanced services to consumers. He says that through shrewd investments, he can sustain a technical advantage over his competitors. That, in turn, would let Level 3 sustain a cost advantage, enabling the company to persist as a wholesaler of long-distance bandwidth.
"I think I can drop prices faster than anyone else can keep up with and have margins that are sustainable," Mr. Crowe said. "If you can get a six- or nine-month technical advantage over your competition, you can have a long, long, long life."
The stock market has hardly abandoned Mr. Crowe's world view -- shares of Level 3 are up 56 percent this year -- but others in the industry say he is ignoring the commoditization of bandwidth at considerable peril.
"I respect Jim and I've worked with Jim, but I think he's absolutely, completely dead wrong," Mr. Sidgmore said. "It really is black and white. The fact of the matter is that if you just stand back and think about it, Jim is not going to invent any new technology. It's coming from Lucent or Cisco. And do you think they're going to give anyone an exclusive? If you wanted to give someone an exclusive, it would be the company that could buy the most product; it would be MCI Worldcom or AT&T."
But Level 3 is different from those companies -- if not from Qwest or Global Crossing, in their original guises -- because it has no existing customer or revenue base to protect. That, Mr. Crowe says, will keep his company more focused.
"History tells us that when you get bigger and bigger and more and more vertically integrated, you break businesses apart," Mr. Crowe said. "That's like starting a computer company in 1980 and saying the model is I.B.M."
Indeed, some communications experts think that consumers will suffer as carriers seek vertical integration.
"As someone on the buying end of it, rather than the selling end of it, I'd like the companies that provide bandwidth to do a really good job of that rather than do what the local telcos have done, which is bring services into their networks," said Robert M. Metcalfe, one of the founders of the 3Com Corporation. Mr. Metcalfe, now an industry consultant, contends that the Bell companies, which dominate local communications, have done a poor job of making advanced services available to consumers, even as they try to fend off competition.
For investors, it may not really matter who is right. Even some people who own or recommend the stocks of companies like Level 3 acknowledge that the pure bandwidth strategy may not endure for the long term -- but add that many such companies will probably be acquired in the next few years anyway, perhaps as foreign carriers expand into the United States.
Still, some professional investors are shifting their focus to the remaining points of scarcity in the communications business -- local assets and expertise in advanced services, especially on the Internet. That is why Michael J. Mahoney, director of telecommunications investment at Dresdner RCM Global Investors, likes MCI Worldcom but is also becoming more bullish about local communications companies.
"We have a decent position on the local side," he said, "and if anything, we're steadily growing in our affection for the local side." Mr. Mahoney particularly likes GTE, which is trying to merge with Bell Atlantic, and SBC, which appears close to completing its deal to buy Ameritech.
Mr. Mashinsky of Arbinet, the communications exchange in Manhattan, watches the new world of long-distance evolve every day on his computer screen. To him, the shift is clear. The future is not in electronic pork bellies; it is in the fiber optic equivalent of processed meats.
"Over the last three years, $402 billion was invested in telecom worldwide, and a lot of that went into infrastructure," he said. But many companies "have not been able to fill up their networks, because there are too many people building networks.
"So a lot of these guys are refocusing," Mr. Mashinsky added, "and saying that if we want to retain our margins, we have to get a hold of some customers and add some value."
 
Changes Down the Food Chain
 
IF long-distance phone service is becoming a commodity and bandwidth is being traded at the wholesale level for pennies a minute, some everyday telephone users may be wondering why their phone bills are becoming more complicated and sometimes going up.
The answer is as unfortunate for the relatively unwired as it is welcome for the long-distance industry: You have to spend in order to save.
The falling cost of long-distance capacity is, in fact, leading to drastically lower per-minute rates. Some small carriers, like the IDT Corporation, offer flat rates as low as 8 cents a minute for calls at any time to anywhere in the country.
But many consumers who want the psychological comfort and gold-plated service of a big-name carrier are now facing monthly minimum charges. AT&T, for instance, recently began charging its basic rate customers -- those who do not sign up for a special calling plan -- a $3 monthly minimum. MCI Worldcom also charges many of its basic rate customers a monthly minimum of up to $5. The carriers justify the charges by explaining that they were incurring more costs in billing and tracking low-volume customers than they were taking in as per-minute fees.
Regulatory changes have made bills even more complex. Long-distance bills include a monthly charge of about $1 to cover the cost of offering local service in poor and rural communities, as well as a flat fee of at least $1 to cover the cost of linking long-distance and local networks.
Consumers were paying for these things before, but as part of higher per-minute rates. With the Telecommunications Act of 1996, those fees are now flat and explicit, while per-minute rates have declined. SETH SCHIESEL

Measuring TheForce Of the Euro

BYLINE: By JOHN TAGLIABUE 

DATELINE: ROME

 BODY:
SIX months into the euro era, some of the assumptions about how European stock markets would behave once the single currency arrived are looking shaky.
One theory, for instance, had it that the euro would shift market volatility to industry sectors and away from individual national markets. Indexes would be moved more by, say, European auto sales figures than by a political crisis in Italy or France. Some people even predicted the end of single-country mutual funds, as Europe transformed itself into a market like the United States, where investors watch chemicals, automobiles or electronics, and not necessarily the Northeast or the Midwest. 
 Indeed, European stock markets appeared headed in that direction, with announcements of planned mergers involving exchanges in Frankfurt, London, Paris, Milan and elsewhere.
But in the euro's first half-year, it has not worked out quite that way, at least yet. Borders still count along with sectors in investment decisions, and national stock markets have been casting up widely differing returns. While France, Germany and Finland made big gains in the last six months, Belgium and Portugal have slumped, and Spain and Italy have been somewhat listless.
Part of the explanation is that the euro's arrival has sent huge amounts of capital across national borders as currency hurdles have fallen.
Whereas a German asset manager like Commerzbank previously had more than half its funds in German stocks, that fraction has now dropped to one-third, said Nils Stoerling, chief investment officer at the bank's asset management arm in Frankfurt. The pattern has repeated itself across the Continent, pushing up some markets and hurting others as institutions redeploy their money.
In Spain, about 70 percent of fresh capital is going into Europe-wide investments, and only 30 percent into Spanish shares, said Eduardo Suarez, head of asset management at Santander Gestion de Activos in Madrid. A result: The Madrid stock index fell from a high in January before gaining ground again this month. "The appetite for euro equities is outstanding," he said.
The shift is not only geographical. Money is also flowing from the stocks of small companies -- those with a market value of $300 million to $1.5 billion -- into large-capitalization European corporations that are the elite of European business. "It is something we saw from about a year ago," said Felix Lanters, head of European equity investment at ABN Amro Asset Management in Amsterdam. "And it is one reason why the big caps are outperforming the market. There is interest in top names."
Commerzbank, Mr. Stoerling said, used to follow the old DAX 100-stock index of German companies. Now, its asset managers have assembled a 270-stock index, he said, with almost two-thirds of the companies spread across Euroland, as the euro nations are called, plus Switzerland and Britain, which have not adopted the currency.
As had been expected, many European asset managers are also reorganizing their research, shifting it from individual European countries to industry sectors or a blend of the two. "We started looking at sectors six years ago," said David Duncan, of Global Asset Management in London.
But, he said, his firm still casts "generally, a final glance" at geography, "to make sure you're not 95 percent in Finland, because you've liked the looks of Nokia," the hugely popular Finnish phone company.
Eric Taze-Bernard, chief investment officer in Luxembourg at Paribas Asset Management, said many institutional investors now combine sector and regional analysis. Their reluctance to jettison regional factors, he said, was a result of their rejection of a "false idea about economic convergence."
Rather than forcing European economies to march more closely in step, he said, the euro's imposition of uniform interest rates on differing national economies has served to sharpen cyclical differences. Lower European interest rates may help spur growth in slow economies, like Germany's or Italy's, but can overheat economies that are purring nicely, like Ireland's.
For the moment, many asset managers expect the drive into European large-cap companies to continue. Mr. Suarez of Santander estimated that "only about 30 percent of the reorganization is done," and said it would take one to two more years before capital flows began shifting away from large-cap companies in major economies like Germany and France and toward small-cap companies in markets like Ireland, Belgium and Portugal.
The shifting capital flows, however, are enhanced by a flood of new money that is likely to lift European stocks over all, experts say. J. Paul Horne, an economist at Salomon Smith Barney in London, said European transfers from traditional forms of savings, like bank accounts and life insurance, to stocks and corporate bonds would probably total about $1 trillion in two to three years, buoying European markets.
And the current strength of the dollar against the euro adds to the possible allure of European stocks for American investors. Since it was introduced, the euro has fallen from nearly $1.18 to just below $1.02 on Friday. A rebound in the euro's value would add to European stock market returns in dollars. "The euro, having hit a trough," he said, "adds to the attractiveness of European securities."

This Just In: The Latest Buzz From California

BYLINE: By TODD S. PURDUM 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES

 BODY:
IN the two decades since John Belushi bellowed, "Your honey or your wife!" as a corpulent killer bee on "Saturday Night Live," those relentless, aggressive insects have passed out of the realm of schlock movies and sketch comedy and into the daily reality of life in states along the Mexican border, beginning nine years ago in Texas.
This spring, the last corner of Los Angeles County's 4,000 square miles was declared officially colonized by Africanized honey bees, when a swarm was found lurking under the eves of a building in the desolate desert suburb of Palmdale. 
 Science has been powerless to stop the bees' steady northward march from South America, and the sighting of a single swirling swarm in a backyard tree can still prompt a brief mention on the local television news.
But there is nothing like the panic in the streets that Hollywood's mid-1970's imagination predicted.
Maybe Californians have reacted to this latest invader with equanimity because their state has long been home to a rogues' gallery of flying, crawling pestilence. This is, after all, the place "where bowers of flowers bloom in the sun," and that means a motley chorus of pests the world over is always buzzing "California, Here I Come!" and posing new threats to the state's $27 billion-a-year agricultural industry.
There are thrips, tiny juice-sucking insects that prey on avocados, scarring and discoloring the fruit so it looks like a potato. There are olive fruit flies from the Mediterranean, discovered here last fall, the first ever in California and perhaps in all of North America, which leave black olives grayish-white and rotting. There are red imported fire ants from South America, whose mounds grow as big as basketballs and make it hard to move harvesting equipment through orchards.
And now come the Africanized bees, whose ancestors came from South Africa and were released inadvertently from a Brazilian breeding experiment 42 years ago. They have gradually moved north and west, and recently were discovered for the first time east of the Mississippi River, in Jacksonville, Fla.
The bees are no more venomous than their calmer cousins but are considerably more aggressive, capable of delivering 10 times as many stings.
In California, the bees stand poised to colonize the commercial honey-bee hives that are vital to pollinating commercial crops, principally almond groves. Because the Africanized bees are unpredictable and harder to manage, they represent a threat to an important industry.
"Why do we have so many things blooming and growing together here that don't belong together?" asks Robert Page, an entomologist at the University of California at Davis who has helped isolate a gene that may make Africanized bees meaner. "We've been a real cultural mixing bowl forever. Everybody who comes wants to bring their favorite plant. And when they come, they also bring their favorite plant's parasite or disease agent."
In this state, there is seldom a letup.
In 1982 the State Department of Agriculture set up the Pest Detection Emergency Protection division to combat an invasion of the Mediterranean fruit fly, which attacks 250 types of crops.
"We had a long discussion about what we would do when there wasn't an emergency project to keep people busy," Pat Minyard, the division's manager, said ruefully, adding: "We've never had that situation. There is an extraordinary range of problems."
Alan Jennings, director of Pest Management Policy for the Department of Agriculture in Washington, said he knew of no formal ranking of pests by state, but that California and Florida, with their warm climates, long growing seasons and diverse crops, would be together at the top.
"It's not a pest unless it's doing something economically," Mr. Jennings said. "What rises to be a pest is a direct function of what you're growing."
For ordinary citizens, Africanized bees can be a severe annoyance, and there have been a handful of fatalities, including a 72-year-old man who was attacked and killed two years ago in his mobile home in Casa Grande, Ariz.
Noise, like that from lawn mowers or leaf blowers, seems to aggravate the bees. The Africanized variety will chase a human who disturbs it up to a quarter mile, 12 times as far as the European bee, and if you duck under water, it will simply outwait you.
"Right now, everyone should just increase their awareness about it," said Oscar Hidalgo, a spokesman for the State Agriculture Department. "There's not really much that we can do to stop its flow. We live with a lot of pests that can harm you, sting you. Awareness is the key."
By contrast, California works diligently to stop the flow of pests that pose more immediate threats to agriculture, especially the various fruit flies that love backyards and commercial orchards.
At the moment, much of San Diego is under quarantine because of Mexican fruit fly infestations, and big black and white signs dotting the freeways warn residents not to move fruit from trees in their own backyards.
"A lot of times, people don't realize the impact they could have in bringing even a single piece of fruit," Mr. Hidalgo said. "You shouldn't even take it off your property. If you take it a mile, two miles to your office, now that's an infested area, too. But it's something we have to basically use the honor system on."
Last fall, in the Westwood section of Los Angeles, 10 olive fruit flies were found in a residential neighborhood, and about 400 have now been trapped in an effort to gauge the scale of the problem over a 300-square mile area.
Officials say it was the first-ever sighting of this pest in California, though it is widespread in Europe and North Africa. Unlike other fruit flies, it poses a threat only to olives, but California is the nation's sole producer of commercially grown olives, with a 1997 crop valued at nearly $70 million. Most of the growing areas are well north of Los Angeles, but officials are taking no chances.
"Right now," said Mr. Minyard of the state agriculture department, "we're just trapping, trying to wait and see."

HEADLINE: Ideas & Trends: Common Causes;
Left and Right Are Crossing Paths

BYLINE: By ETHAN BRONNER 

 BODY:
THE bedfellows get stranger and stranger: Henry J. Hyde, the anti-abortion, right-wing Republican Congressman, joins forces with Barney Frank, the gay, left-wing Democrat, to curb Federal power in property forfeiture: Ron K. Unz, the conservative Republican who helped end bilingual education in California, argues against school vouchers in the pages of The Nation, a leftist magazine; the Clinton Administration fights its longtime allies, the trade unions, over their support of steel import quotas.
Politics has long forged odd alliances but there is clearly something significant happening to the national debate when give-peace-a-chance Vietnam doves morph into Kosovo hawks and the front-runner for each party's Presidential nomination slams the door on traditional party militants to capture the political center when the nomination process has barely begun. 
 Not long ago, when people were described as "on the left" or "on the right," liberal or conservative, Democrat or Republican, their views on a range of issues -- on religion and state, education, war and peace, taxation -- could be inferred. That's no longer the case.
Republicans who tried for years to kill the Department of Education now want to be known as the education party. The Democrats, whose long commitment to fighting poverty was evident last week in President Clinton's tour of the nation's poor areas, have effectively ended welfare. And the White House, sounding like a group of Rockefeller Republicans, says a keystone of foreign policy should be opening the world to American exports and investments.
"All the big issues that used to divide the left and right -- the cold war, inflation, crime, welfare -- have just collapsed as partisan issues," said Francis Fukuyama, a professor of public policy at George Mason University. Professor Fukuyama predicted, in some fashion, the current confusion a decade ago with a much-discussed article in The National Interest magazine titled "The End of History?" in which he argued that liberal democracy and a market-oriented economy were the only viable option for modern societies.
Professor Fukuyama was dismissed by those who noted that history, far from ending, quickly found other conflicts on which to focus: the era of the angry white male in American politics, followed by the Clinton impeachment fight, made reports of the death of ideology and the end of the culture war seem premature.
Moreover, some believe that the big conflicts are far from over, that a vague and dangerous centrism has masked, not solved, them. Republican conservatives, disenchanted by the party's abandonment of the crusade against abortion and other matters they consider pro family, said last month they might start a new party.
"The relativism that is being so widely adopted may be the dominant culture, but there is another culture that is very uncomfortable with it and is resisting it," said Gertrude Himmelfarb, a conservative historian, whose book "One Nation, Two Cultures," is to be published this fall by Knopf. "There are many of us who are still resisting the 60's."
THE traditional left is no less incensed by what it sees as the nation's acquiescence to the Reaganism of the 1980's -- the end of welfare, the growing resegregation of American schools, the wide acceptance of the death penalty and the lack of availability of health care for millions of people.
"There is no question that the failure of Communism has a lot to do with the marginalization of the left," said Katha Pollitt, a columnist for The Nation. "But for me the central value of the left is a commitment to equality, including economic equality, and we have less of that today than we had 20 years ago."
Nonetheless, few in this country or abroad argue much any more with Professor Fukuyama's point about the centrality of markets to modern societies.
Robert Hue, national secretary of the French Communist party, which in the 1970's and 80's maintained a firm Marxist line, said recently: "The Communists are not adversaries of the market. The Communists have broken with the statist vision of things."
The leftist governments in Britain and Germany are further evidence of this change. When the Labor Party leader Tony Blair was elected Prime Minister in Britain, a London tabloid ran a caricature of him dressed in baby clothes as his Conservative predecessor, Margaret Thatcher, cooed, "It's a boy."
In Russia today, Communists are considered conservatives and free-marketers liberals. In Israel, the group that most resembles the founding socialist Zionists, with their frowzy clothes, collectivist vision and unyielding dedication, are the right-wing Jewish settlers in the West Bank.
There is much talk among former leftists here and in Europe of something they call the third way, or what may be seen as capitalism with a conscience. But it is pretty hard to distinguish it from the compassionate conservatism that serves as the rallying cry of Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, the Republican Presidential front-runner.
Indeed, while the eclipse of the left has clearly played a major role in the shift, the demise of the right is equally significant. Paul Weyrich, who coined the phrase Moral Majority in the 1970's and was the godfather of what became a substantial political movement, said recently that the effort had ended in failure.
Governor Bush has said he will not require judicial nominees to oppose abortion, which had been a standard Republican position. The evangelist Pat Robertson has acknowledged: "There's no way that we are going to pass a constitutional amendment banning abortion. It's just not going to happen."
A few months ago, when Mr. Weyrich said, "We lost the culture war," he was referring to the fact that most Americans did not view President Clinton's extramarital sex and lies as the basis for impeachment, but he was also casting the issue in larger terms: efforts to expunge 60's-era personal morals had failed.
Alan Wolfe, a professor of political science at Boston College, agrees in some sense with Mr. Weyrich. He spent several years interviewing middle-class Americans for his book "One Nation, After All" (Viking, 1998) and found that most people are far more tolerant of others and other ways of life than is often assumed.
As Professor Wolfe puts his findings now, "The right won the economic war, the left won the cultural war and the center won the political war."
While most analysts agree that the nation seems to be entering an uncharted era of consensual politics, they don't agree on why.
Michael Lind, a senior fellow at the New America Foundation in Washington, has argued in a series of books and articles that what is really going on is that a university-trained professional "overclass" has managed to suppress discussion of class conflicts that are as powerful as ever.
The goal of the new ruling class, Mr. Lind argues, is increased wealth and comfort for itself, and anything that interferes -- curbs on immigration, labor or free trade, which would make it harder to find domestic help and cheap employees and the purchase of products it wants -- is opposed by all members of the class, whether they call themselves Democrats or Republicans, liberals or conservatives. Disagreements over so-called wedge issues, Mr. Lind maintains, are a ruse aimed at making the rest of the nation believe there is debate going on.
Virginia Postrel, editor of Reason magazine, a libertarian monthly, has a different interpretation. In her book "The Future and Its Enemies" (Free Press, 1998), she contends that the old categories of left and right have lost their usefulness because the world has changed.
"A defining question in one era -- whether to nationalize the railroads, give women the vote, outlaw racial segregation or abolish the draft -- may be settled and therefore meaningless in another," she writes. "Nowadays, 'conservatives' may support careers for women, and 'liberals' may back the death penalty."
Ms. Postrel urges abandoning traditional political categories and creating new ones, namely "dynamists" -- those who accept and promote innovation -- and "stasists," who favor a regulated, engineered world. She clearly comes down on the side of the dynamists, arguing that only through unregulated experimentation will society advance materially and intellectually.
With the explosion of information and technological innovation, she argues, central planning bodies are impotent; only freedom, even chaos, will do. By promoting such practices, she says, societies will progress; by squelching them, they will go the way of centrally planned governments.
THIS is not a new idea but has come to a kind of fruition. Half a century ago, the conservative economist Friedrich A. Hayek argued that socialism had no future because in a modern economy the vast majority of information generated is local in character and requires higher and higher degrees of sophistication to grasp. As a result, distant managers or bureaucrats are unlikely to be sufficiently nimble or informed to make good decisions.
Today, it is not only Soviet-style governments that have been forced to undergo change but large corporations like I.B.M., which nearly collapsed and has had to create more entrepreneurial styles of work for its employees.
With such a focus on individual initiative and the accompanying access to vast quantities of information, it is not surprising that broad ideological approaches are losing out to a case-by-case, problem-solving one. Nor is it surprising that with increased exposure to other people and ideas has come increased tolerance and openness to other ways of life.
It is entirely appropriate that Silicon Valley has become one of the country's focal points because its arresting combination of market economics and informal personal and social behavior -- Reaganesque politics of the 1980's and Clintonesque morals of the 60's -- seems to define the nation today. Many had previously thought the two incompatible. The sociologist Daniel Bell once wrote of the inherent contradiction between the Protestant ethic of capitalism and the hedonism it created. And Reagan Republicans tended to think of their goal as reversing the trends of the 60's. Yet many analysts argue today that the Reaganites accomplished their own revolution without really shifting the society as they had hoped; they may have curbed the extremes of the 1960's but much of the rest has been absorbed into mainstream culture.
Mark Lilla, a political philosopher at New York University, wrote in The New York Review of Books in May that the two revolutions are coexisting nicely right now.
"The facts are these," he wrote. "The 60's happened, Reagan happened and for the foreseeable future they will together define our political horizon. As anyone who deals with young people today knows, Americans find no difficulty in reconciling the two in their daily lives. They see no contradiction in holding down day jobs in the unfettered global marketplace -- the Reaganite dream, the left nightmare -- and spending weekends immersed in a moral and cultural universe shaped by the 60's."

HEADLINE: A Need for Foreign Aid

 BODY:
For a nation of America's wealth, providing aid to alleviate misery in the poorest countries is a worthy cause. But foreign aid is also important to protect American interests. Assistance that helps prevent foreign political conflicts or economic calamities can reduce the need for far more costly future American involvement.
Congress has ignored this rule, and is once again embarked on an effort to slash foreign aid. Such assistance, which pays for everything from military training for American allies to disaster relief, already makes up less than 1 percent of the Federal budget. 
 Spending on aid has dropped by more than 50 percent in inflation-adjusted dollars since 1985. The Senate last month approved a foreign operations appropriation for 2000 that is $800 million less than this year's $13.5 billion total, and $1.9 billion less than President Clinton's request. The House appropriation is expected to be even lower.
The Clinton Administration has justifiably threatened to veto the appropriations bill unless money is added to pay for programs to dismantle nuclear weapons in the former Soviet Union and to support the Wye River peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians, as well as to restore cuts to dozens of other programs, including the Peace Corps. The White House also strongly opposes language in the spending bill that could limit the Administration's options in managing the situation in Kosovo.
Critics often point to past failures. During the cold war aid was doled out to corrupt anti-Communist regimes that did nothing to improve the conditions of the poor. But aid can be effective in relieving poverty if it is used to strengthen civil society and nurture reform. The Clinton Administration has tried to put money into programs that promote democracy-building, community-based economic development and local initiatives on environmental protection and health care.
Roughly half of the current aid budget supports military or security-related objectives, and is likely to stay that way. Israel and Egypt alone now get about 40 percent of the total. A modest share of the budget is spent on refugee and emergency aid. Only about a third of the budget goes to traditional development activities running the gamut from child immunizations to microcredit programs. Development programs with long-term promise tend to suffer the cuts.
Development experts have become smarter about how to use aid to improve economic and social institutions. The World Bank recently reported that an extra $10 billion in aid annually could lift 25 million people out of poverty if the money was directed to countries with sound fiscal policies and a healthy public sector. While more countries are meeting these criteria, total development assistance worldwide from industrialized nations has dropped by one-third since 1991, with Washington leading that decline. The trend is tragic given how much needs to be done to help the more than one billion people in extreme poverty who live on less than $1 a day. The Clinton Administration's goals for foreign aid are not particularly ambitious. But Congress's effort to trim back the meager funds is a shortsighted national shame.

HEADLINE: Ideas & Trends: Karma and Helms;
A Stick for China, a Carrot for Tibet's Lobby

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
IT'S not every day that Jesse Helms and the Beastie Boys find themselves comrades in arms.
About the only thing the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee and the hip-hop group have in common is contempt for China for its treatment of Tibetans. The Beasties hold concerts to support the Dalai Lama. Senator Helms leads the conservative charge against the Clinton Administration's China policy -- coddling dictators to make a buck, he says -- and inveighs against the World Bank, which he and his allies lump together with the United Nations, the International Monetary Fund and other mysterious institutions that often go their own way. 
 This alliance of convenience came together recently in a remarkable face-off between Washington and the World Bank over a development project so small and out of the way that it would usually attract little notice: A $40 million effort to relocate 58,000 of China's poorest farmers -- they make $60 a year -- to more fertile land in Qinghai province in western China. The problem was that they would be moving into territory the Tibetans consider part of their original homeland, even though most maps show it outside Tibet and the Chinese consider it non-Tibetan land. Critics said the bank was aiding China's effort to dilute the minority Tibetan population -- and doing so in the province that was the birthplace of the Dalai Lama, the exiled spiritual leader of Tibet.
And therein lies an unusual tale of Washington lobbying.
In a few weeks the Tibet lobby -- best known for patrons like Richard Gere and Harrison Ford but power-challenged by Washington's usual measures -- mobilized allies on the far left and the far right. In a flash it reversed White House policy, and led the Administration's nominee for Treasury Secretary, Lawrence H. Summers, to announce that the United States would try to block the loan. The World Bank emerged bloodied, and agreed to study the issue anew. It was a feat that the city's highly paid power brokers could only admire.
Usually, only the lobbyists with the deepest pockets and the busiest PAC's get that kind of attention. Silicon Valley, source of all those new-economy campaign contributions, won two tremendous victories recently: limiting damages from suits arising from Year 2000 computer bugs, and convincing the Administration to relax export controls on powerful but widely available computers, including sales to China. After years of wrangling, the House finally passed a financial restructuring bill this month that was so hotly contested by banks and brokerages, and for so many years, that many thought Congress would debate it forever to keep the money flowing in from all sides.
But every once in a while the stars align in a way that smaller and far less wealthy groups can score a big victory. It helps if they show pictures of crushing poverty or tell stories of repression and -- most important -- side with politicians who may have ulterior agendas. The Tibetan crowd did all of that and won at least a partial victory.
"This was a culmination of forces that have been gathering steam for years," said John Kenneth Knaus, who spent four decades at the Central Intelligence Agency helping the Tibetan resistance fight the Chinese and recently recounted that struggle in a book, "Orphans of the Cold War" (Public Affairs, 1999). "They have always been a very cohesive group, and their story has always had a great appeal in Congress. But this time they got further."
CHINA occupied Tibet in 1950, and Tibet's political fortunes have waxed and waned in Washington depending on the prevailing mood toward Beijing. China considers it a province, and screams whenever it believes Washington is meddling in its internal affairs. When the 64-year-old Dalai Lama shows up in Washington, he is handled like a chunk of plutonium, meeting the President in diplomatically staged "drop by" visits, sitting in the offices of lesser officials.
But if ever the Tibet lobbyists had an opportunity, this was the moment. The accusations of Chinese spying at nuclear laboratories in the United States and the anti-American protests after the accidental bombing of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade have left Congressional conservatives looking for a quick, cost-free way to lash out at China. Human rights groups have concluded that the Administration's China policy is one of toothless, token statements.
Onto this battlefield walked the World Bank, whose savvy president, James Wolfensohn, usually sees land mines ahead and saunters around them. But China was pressing for this loan as part of a last series of interest-free deals that end after June 30. The details were rushed. The environmental studies were done once over lightly. "It was not only politically offensive," said Dana Clark, a senior attorney for the Center for International Environmental Law. "It was done in violation of the bank's own policies." Meanwhile China threatened to end its relations with the bank if the loan was denied -- a step that would give the West less control over Beijing's actions.
Quickly the Office of Tibet, which represents the Dalai Lama, and the International Campaign for Tibet were swinging into action. Members of the Senate were lined up to ask about the program at Mr. Summers'sconfirmation hearing. The Treasury, not looking for a fight at a sensitive time, immediately agreed to oppose the plan. So did Germany. World Bank officials were called to a meeting on Capitol Hill and saw the future.
"When you have a coalition of students in California with body piercings saying the same thing as Jesse Helms," one World Bank official said, "you are on a highway to nowhere." On the left and the right, the official said, the message to the bank was simple: "If you do this, we will kill you."
Mr. Wolfensohn tried to travel to the region himself, then sent a team to reconfirm that the resettlement of the farmers would be voluntary, and that children would attend schools reflecting their ethnic backgrounds. "This is the first time most of these children will get a school," he said. China, he added, didn't need the bank's money -- but with it, the West would have a voice in what China does in the region.
IN the end, the World Bank's board approved the loan for the resettlement -- in part because it feared the United States was moving on an isolationist path that would only worsen relations with China. But the Chinese won't get the money until an independent review board within the World Bank looks at the project. The Tibetan lobby vows to be back.

Map: "Moving In"
A Chinese antipoverty project would resettle 58,000 farmers from an overcrowded, eroded area in the northeastern corner of Qinghai province to a sparsely populated area 300 miles to the west. Qinghai is part of the Tibetan Plateau, which was historically settled by Tibetan and Mongolian people. Forty percent of the proposed settlers would be ethnic Chinese, along with Hui Muslims and other groups. Critics have attacked the plan as a threat to Tibetan culture. Map of China shows where the farmers live now and where they would move.

HEADLINE: The Nation;
For Better and Worse, Poverty's Poster Child

BYLINE: By PETER APPLEBOME 

 BODY:
WHEN President Clinton headed to the back roads of Appalachia last week to call attention to those left out of the nation's pageant of prosperity, his visit had a distinctly familiar air. John F. Kennedy, Robert Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson had all made the trip more than 30 years ago.
You can still find many of the poorest Americans living in the shadow of rickety coal tipples in Appalachian hollows, but Mr. Clinton's visit, in fact, had as much to do with change as constancy. Despite the poverty that persists, Appalachia is a very different place with very different economic development needs than it was in the 1960's. 
 What never seems to change is the mythology of the place as the poster child for American poverty, an image that persists, to the region's detriment and benefit, no matter how much times change.
"We're always glad when we get any kind of attention, because the region remains so misunderstood," said Jean Haskell, director of the Center for Appalachian Studies and Services at East Tennessee State University.
"Unfortunately," she said, "what happens a lot of the time is that images are so ingrained, we get, by definition, the same old culture-of-poverty story. It's a very oversimplified view of the region."
Images of Appalachian poverty go back to regional writing of the 19th century. But that image of a place "below the bottom looking up to see the bottom," as one local mayor put it in the 1960's, took on particular resonance during that era, when the ills of Appalachia became a prime spur for the War on Poverty.
Appalachia still remains poorer than the nation as a whole, and in forlorn coal mining communities far off the interstates life can seem every bit as dismal as it did 35 years ago. But, by most measures, Appalachia is becoming less a place apart.
In 1960, 219 of the 406 counties in the region qualified as distressed, meaning they had poverty and unemployment levels 150 percent of the national norm, and per capita income two-thirds or more below the national norm. Today 108 counties are listed as distressed.
In 1960, 31 percent of the people in the region lived in poverty compared to 22 percent nationally. Now the poverty rate is 15 percent, just two points above the national average. Once an educational wasteland, the region now has a high school graduation rate slightly above the national average.
Much of the region has not shared in the current prosperity. But from the manufacturing hub of Tupelo, Miss., to the aerospace center at Huntsville, Ala., to the glutted tourism scene in Gatlinburg and Pigeon Forge, Tenn., or the booming retirement and second-home meccas in Asheville, Cashiers or Highlands, N.C., much of Appalachia is basking in the same economic glow as the rest of the nation.
"The truth of the matter is the region has progressed tremendously in the 34 years since Johnson went there," said Jesse White, the Federal co-chairman of the Appalachian Regional Commission, which was established in 1965 to promote economic development. It is headed each year by a Federal appointee and by a governor of one of the states.
BUT the old images persist, and were probably reinforced by Mr. Clinton's trip, a subject that people in the region view with very mixed feelings.
On the one hand, Appalachia has benefited enormously because of its down-and-out image.
Since 1965, the Appalachian Regional Commission has approved spending $7.4 billion in the region, which covers parts of 13 states. Nearly two thirds of that has gone to build 2,400 of an anticipated 3,000 miles of highway.
On the other hand, it is a short step or two from the image of pervasive poverty to the stereotype of inbred, gap-toothed hillbillies who, needy or not, are not necessarily the most likely targets for corporate recruiters looking for attractive expansion sites.
"You have to call attention to the problems to get the proper kind of focus," said Gov. Cecil H. Underwood of West Virginia, the other commission co-chairman. "But if you overplay it, then it just adds to the morale problems and the loss of hope."
There was both praise for and skepticism about Mr. Clinton's talk of new markets, investment and entrepreneurship.
And a bleak analysis would say that, despite the progress, the region faces enormous new hurdles because its traditional strengths in natural resources do not go as far in an age defined by microchips rather than coal mines.
But both Mr. White and Ms. Haskell said that the trip reflected a contemporary approach to the region's economic development -- more focused on entrepreneurship and long-term investment than on smokestack chasing or anti-poverty programs. In that sense, Mr. White said, maybe the imagery of the region will finally begin to change.
"This was a very different trip than the one L.B.J. took in the 1960's," he said. "If you remember, President Clinton's second stop was to an electronics company started by a man who left the region and then came back and created good-paying jobs. The last thing we wanted was for the bad news of Appalachia to be the only story that came out of this trip."

Chart/Map: "Shrinking Appalachia"
In the 1960's, Congress defined the Appalachian region as counties that shared these traits: inaccessibility by interstate highways, low productivity, heavy reliance on too few industries and marginal agriculture. In 1960, 219 of those counties were distressed economically, which meant that the poverty and unemployment rates were at least 150 percent higher than the national average, and per capita income was at least 67 percent lower than the national average. Today, 108 counties in the Appalachian region are considered distressed. Maps of the Eastern United States shows distressed counties in 1960 and in 1999. (Source: Appalachian Regional Commission)

If Not Now, When?

BYLINE: By BOB HERBERT 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES

 BODY:
Bill Clinton's mood was upbeat. The appearance with Gov. Gray Davis and Magic Johnson at the high school in Watts had gone well. Now he adjusted his long legs in the back seat of the limousine and began answering questions about his effort to draw private investors to some of the poorest regions of America.
The President contends that there are "new markets" to be tapped, and therefore "money to be made," in such chronically distressed areas as Appalachia, the Mississippi Delta, the vast Pine Ridge Indian Reservation in South Dakota and inner-city neighborhoods like Watts. 
 "This is not like either the Great Society of the 60's or the great neglect of the 80's," said Mr. Clinton. "This is about getting good jobs into the inner cities and rural areas by building an economic infrastructure that is part of the private economy."
Mr. Clinton will send legislation to Congress this week that calls for $1.6 billion in Federal tax credits and loan guarantees that are designed to stimulate $15 billion in private investments over five years.
There are skeptics, especially among those who think Mr. Clinton should have done more for the poor during his first six years in office. Without question, he should have. And this is a modest effort at a time when the nation could afford a much grander assault on poverty.
But Mr. Clinton's proposal is, at least, a start. And if even this modest effort fails to win approval at a time when the nation is experiencing its greatest prosperity ever, it would mean that we truly care nothing at all about the poor among us.
Congressional approval is not a lock. With the nation enjoying a spectacular budget surplus, the Republican Party is looking lustily at another big tax cut. It is not much interested in initiatives that might bring struggling Americans into the economic mainstream.
The President scoffed at the G.O.P. tax-cut plans, saying, "If you pay for their tax cut and their defense proposals, it would restore the deficit and dramatically cut our investments in the areas of education and health care and the environment."
He said, "It would be a terrible mistake to walk away from our education obligations, and it would be, I think, very dumb to restore the deficit if we can avoid it."
Then a grin crossed his face. "You know," he said, "the Republicans have made a lot of money out of our economic policy. That's one of the reasons they can afford to finance their campaigns so generously. They've done well."
Without mentioning George W. Bush by name, the President said it was as if the Republicans had decided, "O.K., you've made us a lot of money. Now we want to be in power again, and change the economic policy."
His grin broadened. "Keep in mind," he said, "I'm for a tax cut, too. I just think it ought to be affordable."
Mr. Clinton's visit to Los Angeles came at the end of a four-day tour of impoverished regions across the nation. In some cases he visited people experiencing gruesome levels of distress, including a woman at the Pine Ridge Reservation who lived with 28 others in a five-bedroom dwelling.
These are the glory days of our prosperity. If now is not the right time to offer help to those who are really hurting, to Americans who live in shacks and caves, and with barely enough food to survive, then when?
At the end of the interview with Mr. Clinton, I asked if he and the First Lady are committed to living in New York even if she loses her bid for the Senate.
He referred to a conversation they had in 1993, when he said to Mrs. Clinton, "Ever since you came to Arkansas in 1973, we've lived where my work dictated, and where I wanted to live."
He said he told her that at the end of his Presidency he would have to spend a lot of time in Arkansas establishing his Presidential library and center. "But I said, 'I will live wherever else you want to live.' And she had told me years ago that she wanted to go to New York. And I said, 'That's fine with me. I love New York. I'll be happy to live there.
"So I'm going to divide my time between New York and Arkansas, no matter what happens."

HEADLINE: East Harlem Mall

 BODY:

To the Editor:
East Harlem will pay a heavy price if a plan to build a $150 million shopping center in the community is allowed to go forward (news article, July 6). 
 Schools and homes exist on the property of the site. And because the site is above the last exit on the Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive, all of the traffic heading to it will have to use local streets. Thousands of schoolchildren walk to schools, day care centers and after-school programs within a five-block radius of the site.
East Harlem's children and elderly residents already suffer disproportionately from asthma and respiratory infections.
The project will start by destroying a dozen long-established local businesses and 144 jobs. There ought to be some things that money can't buy, and among them are the heart and soul of a community.

Steal a Bundle. Get Out of Town. Now Try to Call It Home.

BYLINE: By LESLIE EATON 

 BODY:
THE duffel bag full of diamonds makes for a great plot twist, no doubt about it. Also the "to do" list that began, "Launder money." All in all, the tale of Martin R. Frankel is already making a most satisfying addition to the lore of that most modern of outlaws, the fugitive financier.
There have been a surprising number of them in the last three decades, with Robert Vesco being perhaps the most notorious. And their stories serve as a reminder that even millions of dollars of loot cannot buy happiness, at least when you're on the lam. A good safe haven is hard to find. 
 Mr. Frankel was a reclusive stock trader who operated from Greenwich, Conn., where secretive money managers are thick on the ground. But last year, while John Meriwether and the crew at Long-Term Capital Management were legitimately losing billions of dollars through complex trades and threatening the foundations of the world financial system, prosecutors say Mr. Frankel was engaged in a rather different economic activity: looting insurance companies.
Mr. Frankel disappeared in early May, shortly before firefighters in Greenwich were called to one of his estates to douse a smoldering filing cabinet. Investigators found, among other things, the "to do" list, as well as astrological charts created to help answer the question, "Should I leave?"
The stars must have been auspicious; Mr. Frankel has disappeared, along with millions (perhaps billions) of dollars, according to prosecutors and court documents. A diamond dealer has confirmed that he sold Mr. Frankel $10 million worth of stones, and that associates of the financier packed them up in two suitcases and a duffel bag.
Mr. Frankel is believed to be hiding in Europe now, but only after having looked into countries elsewhere that have been safe havens for other financial fraudsters.
One was Brazil, where Ronald Biggs has become something of a tourist attraction. Mr. Biggs helped pull off Britain's Great Train Robbery in 1963, and escaped from prison in 1965; he surfaced in South America in 1970, and has since managed to fend off all efforts to extradite him (Brazil's excuse was that Mr. Biggs had fathered a son there who would be hurt if his father was sent back to face the music).
Another spot Mr. Frankel studied, according to documents he left behind, was Israel, which grants citizenship to almost any Jew who chooses to immigrate (the gangster Meyer Lansky was an exception).
But Israeli citizenship did not help Eddie Antar, also known as Crazy Eddie, whose chain of electronics stores collapsed in 1989. He disappeared shortly thereafter, and prosecutors and lawyers for the company's shareholders discovered that Mr. Antar had spirited millions of dollars to Switzerland, Lichtenstein, England, Canada and Israel.
MR. ANTAR may indeed have been a little nuts; the United States Marshals got on to him after he demanded that the Swiss police help him get access to a frozen bank account. He had apparently been living the high life on several continents under several names but was based in Israel, where he was arrested in 1992; he was sent back to the United States, where he ultimately pleaded guilty to racketeering.
Switzerland may be the best haven of all, depending on what you are charged with. Tax evasion is not cause for extradition there, which is why Marc Rich is flourishing in the Alpine town of Zug. A commodities trader accused of tax cheating, he fled to Switzerland in 1984, and until 1994 ran an extremely successful trading operation.
For foreign-born swindlers, the United States appears to be a popular destination. The Irish Times recently reported on the case of Finbarr Ross, whose financial empire collapsed in 1984 owing investors millions of pounds. He was arrested last year in Oklahoma, where he had become an ordained minister at the Light of Christ Church in the small town of Talequah.
Caribbean islands may seem alluring, but they do not always work out. In the 1980's, J. David Dominelli convinced San Diego's high society that he was a crackerjack currency trader who would make them millions. He wasn't and he didn't.
When his scheme collapsed, he fled to Montserrat, a British colony where he had set up a bank. Maybe he shouldn't have held that news conference; in any event, he was booted out and sent back to Miami, where he was arrested. He was sentenced to 20 years for fraud and tax evasion.
Keeping a low profile can be hard for truly proficient fraudsters. David J. Friedland, a one-time New Jersey state senator, faked his death by staging a scuba-diving accident in the Bahamas in 1985. Soon he was indicted for stealing $20 million from a union pension fund.
Two years later, he turned up in the Maldive Islands in the Indian Ocean, which is pretty much as far from everything as a fugitive can get. But his flashy style and success as a businessman (he had a chain of scuba shops) had attracted too much attention, Federal marshals said after they arrested him in 1987. They added that he had posed for a photo used on a tourism postcard, which may not have been a great move, stealth-wise.
But when it comes to fugitive financiers, nobody beats Mr. Vesco, who could have been dreamed up by Graham Greene (or Ian Fleming). To avoid charges that he had stolen more than $200 million from a European mutual fund, Mr. Vesco fled in 1972 to Costa Rica, which at the time was a haven for the legally challenged.
Buying influence seems to have been part of his modus operandi; in addition to contributing to Costa Rican officials, he made an illegal $200,000 campaign contribution to Richard Nixon. He was also indicted in the United States in 1989 on charges of organizing drug smuggling.
One problem with buying governments, however, is that they do not always stay bought. In the late 1970's, Mr. Vesco was forced to move to the Bahamas, and then, in the 1980's, to Cuba. He appeared to live under the protection of Fidel Castro, and maintained the usual trappings of a successful financial fugitive: houses, cars, planes, yachts and flunkies.
But three years ago, Cuba charged Mr. Vesco with fraud in connection with a company that was supposed to be developing a cure for cancer. He was convicted and, when last heard of, was serving a 13-year sentence in a Cuban prison.
It is not clear exactly what ran out, Mr. Vesco's money or his luck (or Mr. Castro's patience). But at least it narrows the search for the latest fugitive financier: Mr. Frankel probably has no plans to move to Havana.

Even the Heat Didn't Slow the Markets

BYLINE: By MICKEY MEECE 

 BODY:
With little to complain about except triple-digit temperatures, American investors wiped their brows and sent the stock market into new territory.
 In a holiday-shortened week, the Nasdaq broke out with the biggest gains, nearly 2 percent, while the Dow Jones industrials climbed 0.5 percent and the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose about 1 percent. 
 There's not much wrong with the world, Michelle Clayman, chief investment officer of New Amsterdam Partners, told Bloomberg News. Inflation, even though people are nervous about it, is still under wraps. Earnings are coming in better than people expected.
 Even though a host of companies are expected to report generally positive second-quarter earnings this week, some analysts question whether the recent run-up can continue.
 People have already priced strong earnings into the market, Peter Anderson, chief investment officer at American Express Financial Advisors, told The Associated Press.
 Even so, analysts say key economic data to be released this week will show low inflation, which always seems to unleash investor enthusiasm. MICKEY MEECE

Sea Protected Areas Are Source of Debate

BYLINE: By Paul Molyneaux 

 BODY:
Konstantino Papoulidis lives to fish.
"I enjoy selling vegetables and meeting my customers," he said, standing behind his produce counter in Marathon, Fla. "But at the end of the day I close the doors, get in my boat, and go fishing. I obey the rules and catch enough to feed my family and friends. I'm not political, but if anybody gets in the way of my fishing, they're going to hear from me." 
 Papoulidis is one of 5 million recreational and 16,000 commercial fishermen in Florida, all demanding a fair share of the ocean's resources. To guarantee a future for fisheries however, many scientists say as much as 40 percent of the world's marine ecosystems need protection. That means closing or restricting many traditional fishing areas and creating, what are becoming known globally as Marine Protected Areas.
The National Research Council, an independent arm of the National Academy of Science, is in the middle of a government-financed, two-year study of the protected areas. The council's committee of 21 international experts is conducting a series of five public forums around the United States coastlines.
In April, members met in Islamorada, Fla., to gather information for their report on the feasibility of protected areas in the United States. The meeting, held 30 miles northeast of Marathon, surrounded by the 3,674-square-mile Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary, featured fishermen and scientists in the vanguard of designing marine reserves, a more restrictive step beyond existing marine sanctuaries in protecting ocean habitat and resources.
"Everything else has failed," the chairman, Eduarde Houde, said of past policies that have focused on species-specific management. "Marine Protected Areas are the last resort for fisheries management."
The committee is reviewing data collected from sanctuaries and areas currently closed by regulation. According to scientists at Islamorada, protected areas represent a new paradigm in fisheries management: one that works. A national fisheries service scientist, Jim Bohnsack, pointed out the results of closing almost a third of George's Bank off the Maine coast in 1994, creating a de facto protected areas. "Only four years later," he said, "haddock had increased to the point that the trip limit was raised from 500 pounds per day to 2,000 pounds per day."
Some scientists and environmental organizations favor moving ahead with large closings immediately. But Graeme Kelleher, a committee member and a former vice chairman of the World Conservation Union's commission on protected areas, reminded participants, "The success of M.P.A.'s depends on cooperation and support from the fishing community." Kelleher's experience in the South Pacific has shown "that if we close half the reef, we get twice the fish. After a while fishermen start becoming advocates, but they have to be involved in the process from the very start."
The advent of ecosystem management has brought more voices to the table. Scientists, ecotourists, and the public at large are claiming a stake in an area that was once the sole domain of fishermen. In Florida, a region leading the way in protected areas, fishermen, regulators, the tourism industry and conservationists have forged a fragile compromise on a 185-square-mile "no take" marine reserve in the Gulf of Mexico near the Dry Tortugas. They hope it will protect spawning aggregations of important species of snapper and grouper, and increase the overall fish population throughout the Keys.
Elsewhere, fishermen have been less agreeable to closed areas. In New England, inshore regulatory closings have led to angry meetings between regulators and user groups left with no place to fish. Even in Florida, fishermen pressured Gov. Jeb Bush to drop Felicia Coleman from the Gulf of Mexico Fisheries Management Council because of her advocacy of a 500-square-mile closed area off Tampa.
Florida's recreational anglers support conservation but are leery of no-take zones. Islamorada's John Brownlee, a senior editor of Salt Water Sportsman magazine, sees M.P.A.'s, "as a tool, but not a panacea for all the problems in fisheries today. We need to move slowly.
"Recreational fishing is mostly catch and release now, and has a $6 billion economic impact in this state," he said. "You don't want to just start shutting that down. We need to look at traditional management tools. In Florida, for instance, we haven't even tried quotas for the commercial snapper/grouper fishermen."
Vito Calomo, a longtime New England trawlerman and now executive director of the Gloucester Fisheries Commission, agreed that traditional measures should be given a chance before "we draw lines all over the ocean." Calomo testified at the committee's first meeting in Washington. He acknowledged that fish need safe havens, but suggested a different way of creating them. "I told them we need to go back to gear restrictions," he said. "If fishermen didn't have the gear to tow over rockpiles, they wouldn't go there and those would be your marine reserves."
Dr. Les Watling, a scientist at the University of Maine, who recently helped create maps identifying 26 percent of the seabed in the Gulf of Maine and George's Bank as priority areas for protection, responded to Calomo. "If I thought the fishing industry was serious about matching gear to habitat," he said, "I would be the first to join them. Yet there are fishermen who insist in going in those critical areas with rockhopper gear and flattening them out."
Peter Gladding, a Key West commercial fisherman, tried to strike a tone of compromise. "These fish belong to everyone," he said. "As commercial fishermen, we have the first responsibility to protect them." But he believes, "There's no such thing as nonconsumptive use. Catch-and-release fishing has a mortality rate of 5-10 percent. Every time a snorkeler touches a bit of coral it dies. That's not nonconsumptive."
And Calomo is concerned that large protected areas and other regulations will favor recreational fishermen and more highly capitalized, increasingly mobile commercial operations and cause the disappearance of small inshore owner-operators, the last large group of independent food producers in this country. For consumers, that will mean a loss of access to the freshest fish.
Every region has its own particular problems to resolve in creating a regulatory strategy. Both Brownlee and Gladding, are part of the working group designing the 185-square-mile protected area near Florida's Dry Tortugas. "I like M.P.A.'s," said Gladding. "But I don't trust the Government. We've heard 20-2020: 20 percent of all our fishing grounds closed by the year 2020. This is only the tip of the iceberg."
But everyone agrees that something needs to be done. "There's too many fishermen chasing too few fish," said Brownlee. "If we're going to accomplish anything, everybody's got to come to the table ready to gore their own ox."
Everyone, including Konstantino Papoulidis.

New Park Doesn't Insure Success

BYLINE: By MURRAY CHASS 

 BODY:
The Cleveland Indians set the standard. Beginning this Thursday with the Seattle Mariners, a growing group of teams will try to achieve it: move into new park, sell it out every game, finish first every year.
"The Indians are one of the great success stories of the 90's," Gerry Hunsicker, general manager of the Houston Astros, said. "They are the exception rather than the rule. There have been other new parks that have emerged in the last few years and nobody has come close to duplicating what the Indians have done. So doing that would be somewhat of a stretch." 
 The new park has been only one ingredient in the Indians' remarkable turnaround, a team well on its way to its fifth consecutive division championship after it had endured seven successive losing seasons and 13 of 14 before moving into Jacobs Field in 1994.
"It's not only the new park that created their success," Hunsicker said, "but a lot of other things beginning with the structure of the organization and what they've been able to accomplish within the organization. A new ball park doesn't guarantee anything. It still comes back to the people running the organization and the team you're able to put on the field."
The Astros are one of four teams that will move into new parks next season. They will leave the Astrodome for the Ballpark at Union Station. The San Francisco Giants will exit 3Com Park, nee Candlestick, for Pacific Bell Park. In Milwaukee, the Brewers will abandon County Stadium for Miller Park. The Detroit Tigers will forsake 88-year-old Tiger Stadium for Comerica Park.
The Mariners will ignite the mass migration this Thursday when they play the San Diego Padres at brand spanking new Safeco Field.
The question all of these teams have to ponder is this: Are they in the position they wanted to be for their move; that is, are they prepared to try to capitalize on their new parks the way the Indians did? The answers vary.
The Astros and the Giants, who have held first or second place all season, are in better shape than the Mariners, the Tigers and the Brewers. The Mariners, on the other hand, have some elements, namely Ken Griffey Jr. and Alex Rodriguez, that the Tigers and the Brewers don't have. But will they have them for long? "We've received a commitment from ownership to do what we can to extend their contracts beyond 2000," said Chuck Armstrong, the club's president. "Ownership has assured us the resources are there to try to retain them."
The future of Griffey and Rodriguez, who could become free agents after the 2000 season, recently became a hot topic of discussion in Seattle when they were linked, fairly or not, to a dispute between the Mariners and the Public Facilities District, the agency that oversaw construction of the $517 million park, over payment of $100 million by which the cost exceeded the budget.
The Mariners, who have not resembled contenders all season, conceivably could still challenge Texas for the American League West title, but they would have to discover some pitching to do it.
"I don't think it matters what our position is this season," Woodward said. "The fact that we're moving into the stadium should put us in a very nice situation in this market. It gives us half a season to experience the stadium and see if it's more hitter friendly or pitcher friendly."
Armstrong said he would like to see the Mariners become more fan friendly. "We'd like to improve, possibly on the trade front, and hopefully win the A.L. West again," he said. "We hope moving into Safeco Field will give us a boost."
The executive was talking about a playing boost. On the economic side, he estimated that revenue could rise by about $9 million or $10 million beyond what it would have been at the Kingdome for the remaining 42 home games. Other new parks, he said, have created an additional $18 million to $25 million a year. Woodward cautioned that no one should be fooled by the advantages of a new park.
"A new stadium won't make a small-market club a big-market club," he said. "The Mariners won't become the Yankees. But it will enhance your present position."
The Tigers and the Brewers are in the shakiest positions as they approach their new parks, because they haven't progressed as rapidly as they had expected.
Asked if the Tigers were ready to take their run at the Indians' standard, Randy Smith, their general manager, said: "If you had asked this question in April, I'd have said we're right where we want to be. But guys who have been productive for us in the past haven't been productive. We still feel we have a lot of talent on this club, but we need a star or a face guy that elevates everyone around him. That's our goal between now and next season."
The Tigers, who fired their pitching coach Friday, are certainly not on track to finish close to .500 or a game or two over, which is what Smith said he had expected. They are, in fact, playing at a rate that would give them a record only a victory or two better than last season's 65-97. Yet Smith said, "I think we're a lot closer to winning than being the club our record indicates."
Then he showed how closely he has studied the Indians' development. "They were 76-86 before they moved into Jacobs Field," he said. "We have a chance to approach that or do better even though we haven't played well."
But returning to reality, Smith acknowledged that the Indians' feat "may be a once-in-a-lifetime thing."
Sal Bando knows how Smith feels. As general manager of the Brewers, he has presided over disappointment, too. "The ideal situation would be to be more competitive than we are at the present time," Bando said. "The worst scenario would be that we'd be in the middle of the pack, then add some pieces to be competitive in our first year in the new stadium."
But, noting the process the Brewers began in 1994, he added: "You've got to be right on in your predictions of when your guys are going to mature. We may be one year behind or two years behind, but right now we aren't where we thought we'd be."
Like his counterparts, Bando is envious of the Indians' success but said: "One thing you don't have now that you did then was the ability to take Joe Carter and his million-dollar contract and trade him and get prospects. Today you can't trade your $8 million player and do that."
The Indians traded Carter nearly 10 years ago, a year before he could become a free agent, for Sandy Alomar Jr. and Carlos Baerga, who grew into part of the nucleus that took Jacobs Field by storm.
Like the Tigers, the Brewers plan to increase their payroll for next season, but Bando was wary about how he would be able to go about it.
"The question is who will be out there and can we get him," he said. "If we want him, others will, too, and will we be able to spend what others will?"
The Giants, solid contenders for the third successive season, don't have the problems the Brewers and the Tigers have.
"We've more or less accomplished our goal of being the best team, the best organization we can be going into the new park," General Manager Brian Sabean said. "If you can accomplish that, the new park will enhance things. The new park won't make us a better team or organization. You have to do that with people first. I think we've succeeded in doing that."
Now, Sabean said, the Giants look forward to maintaining their position and the increased revenue the new park will bring.
The Astros, who are working on their third consecutive division championship, have a similar outlook.
"We started our plan a couple years early," Hunsicker, their general manager, said. "We've allowed our payroll to increase rather significantly in anticipation of moving into the new park. We had a solid nucleus we wanted to try to keep in place going in there. I'm pleased with what we have."
 
Lots of Losses at the Break
When Steve Trachsel pitches for the Chicago Cubs tonight, he will be in a position to suffer his 13th loss. The last pitcher who reached the All-Star Game break with at least 13 losses, Elias Sports Bureau research reveals, was Bill Wegman of the Milwaukee Brewers, who suffered his 14th loss in 1993 in the team's 81st game July 6 and didn't start again that season. He spent more than two months on the disabled list with a strained forearm and a stomach disorder. Fourteen losses in 81 games can do that.
The last National League pitcher who achieved that ignominious level of 13 losses was Jose DeLeon of Pittsburgh, who had a 2-13 record at the break in 1985. He finished the season with a 2-19 record after spending four weeks in the minor leagues and then, after returning and reaching 19 losses, being relegated to the bullpen.
 
Abundance of Rookie Pitchers
The major leagues, by necessity, are filled with rookie pitchers. Some of them even win a game now and then. Jose Jimenez of St. Louis has become the best known rookie pitcher because he pitched a no-hitter against Arizona and beat Randy Johnson while doing it. Jeff Weaver of Detroit, Odalis Perez of Atlanta, Kris Benson of Pittsburgh and Freddy Garcia and John Halama of Seattle have pitched and won enough for fans to start recognizing their names.
But who among those fans can identify Pat Daneker, Gil Meche, Jeremy Powell, Wade Miller and Mike Fyhrie? They are rookie pitchers who made their first major league starts last week: Daneker for the Chicago White Sox, Powell for Montreal, Miller for Houston and Meche and Fyhrie against each other in a game between Seattle and Anaheim.
 
Dodgers Ready to Deal
The Los Angeles Dodgers, embarrassed beyond belief, are trying to make some moves to shake up their last-place team. The baseball grapevine says they are trying to trade Ismael Valdes, one of their underachieving starting pitchers, and have talked with Detroit about a swap of first basemen, Eric Karros for Tony Clark. . . . The Colorado Rockies, who have unsuccessfully tried to trade Darryl Kile, their disappointing starting pitcher, have apparently decided to expand their efforts in remaking their disappointing team. Dante Bichette and others are available. The team's ownership has discovered that the hiring of Manager Jim Leyland at $2 million a year was not the answer. "They've found out that Don Baylor was not the problem," an executive of another team said, referring to Leyland's predecessor. . . . A rumor surfaced last week that Bud Selig had just completed his first year as commissioner. Try telling that to Sue Selig, his wife. She knows that he has been commissioner for seven years, longer than five of his eight predecessors.

HEADLINE: G.O.P. RENEWS PUSH FOR A BIG TAX CUT, CITING THE SURPLUS

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 10

 BODY:
After nearly two decades in which their desire for big tax cuts was overwhelmed by efforts to eliminate the Federal budget deficit, Republicans in Congress will begin a concerted push in the coming week to pass the largest and most broadly distributed tax reduction since 1981.
They will have to overcome opposition from President Clinton and most Democrats in Congress, as well as indifference among voters, who consistently rank tax cuts below issues like improving education and shoring up Social Security when asked about their priorities. 
 A vote on the emerging Republican proposals in the House Ways and Means Committee on Tuesday or Wednesday -- and a similar vote planned for a week later in the Senate Finance Committee -- will be the opening moves in what could be months of partisan maneuvering. Both the House and the Senate are likely to pass tax bills this summer, setting up a confrontation with Mr. Clinton, who is all but certain to veto anything along the lines of what Republicans are proposing.
Although a compromise is possible, both parties will face tough choices this year on whether to make a deal or fight out the issue on the campaign trail.
In a sign of his party's revived assertiveness on the issue, the chief Republican tax writer in the House, Representative Bill Archer of Texas, the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, said today that the centerpiece of his bill would be a measure Democrats thought they had headed off: a reduction of 10 percent in all personal income tax rates.
The change, which would be phased in gradually over 10 years, would cost roughly $400 billion in that period, nearly half the $864 billion in tax cuts that Mr. Archer intends to include in his bill. Among the bill's other features is a reduction of the top tax rate on capital gains, to 15 percent from 20 percent.
The Archer plan, which would bring the current 15 percent tax bracket down to 13.5 percent, the 28 percent bracket to 25.2 percent and the top 39.6 percent bracket to 35.6 percent, is anathema to liberals, who say it favors the wealthy who need a break the least.
But such a reduction is a long-held goal of conservatives, who say it does nothing more than give the biggest tax cuts to those who pay the most taxes.
Mr. Archer's proposal further hardened positions on both sides. White House officials and Congressional Democrats say the growing budget surpluses present an opportunity to prepare for long-term challenges like the aging of the population while paying off the national debt and investing prudently in areas like education and health care. A big tax cut, they said, would not only endanger those objectives, but risk plunging the nation back into a morass of budget deficits.
Republicans say they too are all for improving education and dealing with social issues. But they say there is so much money on the table that the only way to prevent Washington from spending it on ever-expanding entitlements, additional bureaucracy and pork-barrel projects is to send as much of it as possible back to taxpayers, who can use it more productively than the Government.
"The only reason for this surplus is because taxpayers are paying too much, which is why they deserve a refund," Mr. Archer said. "And if we don't cut taxes now and the money stays in Washington, the politicians will surely spend it. Republicans are determined to protect taxpayers who ultimately get stuck with the bills."
The very magnitude of the projected surpluses suggests there is room for compromise. But for now, both sides are gearing up for several months of all-out partisan warfare.
White House officials say Mr. Clinton is not against tax cuts, noting that he has already put down a bid in the form of his proposal for $250 billion in tax breaks over the next decade intended to spur more retirement savings among low- and middle-income families.
They said, however, that he would stick to his strategy of demanding that any tax cuts await the resolution of efforts to shore up Social Security and Medicare, both of which face financial problems as the baby boom generation grows old.
But the White House is now adding another argument to its case. Administration officials said the surplus estimates being relied on by Republicans were predicated on domestic spending being held to levels that were politically unrealistic and that would require deep cuts in everything from law enforcement to Head Start over the next decade.
Moreover, White House officials said, the surplus projections have been exaggerated by a technical factor. The portion of the surplus that both parties agree is up for grabs, the part generated by general tax revenues rather than payroll tax receipts that are nominally earmarked for Social Security, is $996 billion over the next decade, according to the Congressional Budget Office.
But the $996 billion figure assumes that all of the surplus goes to paying down the national debt, thereby reducing interest costs to the Government. To the degree that the money is used for tax cuts or anything else, interest costs will be higher than assumed, reducing the size of the surplus -- by $179 billion over 10 years, according to an estimate by the Administration. That means, in the Administration's view, that an $864 billion tax cut would return the Government to a deficit a decade from now -- a conclusion that Republicans, who use slightly different numbers, dispute.
"The path we've laid out is a balanced allocation of the surplus," said Jacob J. Lew, the director of the White House's Office of Management and Budget, previewing a line of attack that Administration officials plan to use in coming days.
"If you go down the other route and put everything into a tax cut, sucking up all the dollars, it leaves you either with devastating cuts to programs that would be impossible to deliver on because they'd be unacceptable to the American people, or you'd end up with deficits," Mr. Lew said. Having just recovered from the deficits created in part by the Reagan-era tax cuts and the agonizing choices they forced upon the nation, Mr. Lew said, the country should resist going down a tax-cutting road.
The tax-cutting packages presented in pieces over the last few days by Mr. Archer and his counterpart in the Senate, William V. Roth Jr., the Delaware Republican who is chairman of the Finance Committee, are the first moves in what is likely to be months of maneuvering over the nation's priorities as it shifts into an era of fiscal plenty.
Mr. Roth's proposal is slightly smaller than Mr. Archer's, at no more than $792 billion over 10 years, and it specifically leaves room to deal with one of Mr. Clinton's priorities, adding prescription drug coverage to the Medicare system of health insurance for the elderly.
But both versions are chock-a-block with proposals that have been little more than pipe dreams for Republicans in recent years, from eliminating the tax on estates to reversing the quirk in the tax code that penalizes many married couples.
While Republicans expect neither version to make it into law intact, given Mr. Clinton's opposition, they hope that some of the ideas can be included in any compromise.
The outcome of the sparring over taxes will go a long way toward determining how the parties address a variety of related issues, from Social Security and Medicare to breaking a logjam in Congress over next year's spending bills. And with Republicans and Democrats alike torn over whether confrontation or compromise will play better with voters, it will shape their strategies as they head into the 2000 election campaign.
Many members of both parties in the House would prefer fighting it out over fiscal policy on the campaign trail rather than cutting a deal, judging that staking out a clear ideological position will help them as Democrats fight to wrest control of the chamber from Republicans.
"They're trying to solidify Republican support for a bill they can campaign on, based on the fact that they know this bill will be so irresponsible that the President will be forced to veto it," said Representative Charles B. Rangel of Manhattan, the senior Democrat on the Ways and Means Committee.
The situation is more complicated in the Senate. There, moderate Democrats are open to a substantial tax cut, and Republicans are trying to make it easier for them. The plan introduced by Mr. Roth on Friday was built around a middle-class tax cut far more palatable to Democrats than the approach taken by Mr. Archer in the House.
Some Senate Democrats also see an opportunity to neutralize tax cuts as a political issue.
"Democrats have largely captured the education and environmental issues, and have an expanding advantage on guns and abortion," said Senator Robert G. Torricelli, the New Jersey Democrat who co-sponsored a bipartisan $345 billion tax cut proposal this year. "There is no reason for us to lose on the tax issue."
For their part, Republicans believe that failure to press their tax-cutting agenda could accelerate the slide in their electoral fortunes since 1994 by alienating the conservative base that handed them control of Congress. Indeed, tax cuts are almost as much a moral issue for Republicans as an economic issue.
A high tax burden, Mr. Roth said today in delivering the weekly Republican national radio address, "undermines the fundamental values that dictate that you -- the individuals and families who worked to create this economic expansion -- should be able to use this surplus for you and your loved ones."

GRAPHIC: Chart: "SNAPSHOT: Republican Tax Proposals"
Congress will take up proposals this week for the biggest tax cut since 1981. The House will be considering a reduction worth $864 billion over 10 years, while the Senate will weigh a proposal worth up to $792 billion over that period. President Clinton wants to hold any tax cut to $250 billion over the decade. Among the main elements being drafted by Republicans:
 
PERSONAL INCOME TAX REDUCTION -- The House will consider a plan to cut income tax rates by 10 percent across the board, meaning that the current 15 percent rate would drop to 13.5 percent while the top rate of 39.6 percent would drop to 35.6 percent. The Senate will look at a narrower proposal that would reduce the bottom rate of 15 percent to 14 percent.
 
SAVINGS AND INVESTMENT INCENTIVES -- The House will consider reducing the top rate on capital gains to 15 percent from 20 percent. The Senate will consider expansions of the Individual Retirement Account and 401(k) retirement savings programs.
 
TAX BREAKS FOR MARRIED COUPLES -- The House and the Senate will include changes to reduce or eliminate the so-called marriage penalty, which leads many couples to pay more than they would if they were single.
 
INHERITANCE TAX -- The House version calls for a phased elimination of the estate and gift tax, called the death tax by Republicans.
 
EDUCATION AND HEALTH CARE -- Both the House and the Senate bills contain provisions addressing social issues through proposals like tax-advantaged savings accounts for tuition, making health insurance more affordable for the self-employed and providing breaks for long-term care insurance.

HEADLINE: Albany Lags In Effort to Cut Electricity Use

BYLINE: By ALAN FINDER 

 BODY:
At a time when the rising demand for energy has stretched the New York metropolitan region's power system to the limit, the state has quietly scaled back its effort to promote energy conservation. New York was once a leader among states, but its main program to encourage conservation of electricity has been reduced by 75 percent in the last six years, much to the dismay of environmentalists.
Conservationists have challenged the cutbacks by concentrating on environmental concerns. They say it is important to reduce the demand for electricity to curb air pollution, by diminishing the amount of fuel burned in power plants. 
 But after the blackouts last week in Washington Heights, the Lower East Side and other New York City neighborhoods, environmentalists have seized on what they hope will be a powerful new argument in the debate: reducing the demand for electrical power, they say, would reduce stress on an aging electrical distribution system and diminish the risk of future power failures.
Few if any environmentalists would claim that the cutback in the state's energy conservation program caused the failure of "feeder" cables that carry electricity to neighborhoods from local distribution stations, which led to the blackouts. Instead, they say that a reduction in demand for electricity, especially at peak moments like the hottest days of the summer, would ease the strains on the system.
"You can't say that problems with any single feeder line would not occur," said Edward Smeloff the executive director of the Pace Energy Project at the Pace University School of Law. "But statistically more load means more heat, which causes the failures. The argument for conservation in the current setting is to increase the robustness of the distribution system, to increase its reliability."
The system's reliability, already severely tested in the heat wave, faces much larger tests in the future, utility experts say, since the increasing demand for energy in the New York metropolitan area is not being matched by a comparable increase in the system's capacity to generate and deliver it.
The experts say the answer lies in four areas: building power plants to keep up with demand rising 2 to 3 percent a year nationally; adding new transmission lines to bring power into the metropolitan area; upgrading local lines that deliver electricity, and adopting more aggressive energy conservation programs.
The debate over changes by state regulators in the arcane world of energy conservation has gone on for several years with little public notice. That is in part because the regulations are complicated, but it is also because fuel prices are at record lows and electricity rates remain relatively low. Moreover, the benefits of conserving energy are long term, while the cost of investing in more energy-efficient equipment is immediate.
Americans are far removed from the days, in the 1970's, when the Arab oil boycott caused energy prices to skyrocket and conservation to become a way of life, at least for a while. Just as drivers slowly drifted back to larger, gas-guzzling sedans and sport utility vehicles, consumers of electricity have lost much of their passion for energy-efficient appliances and fixtures.
Beginning a decade ago, state utility regulators tried to encourage consumers to reduce their demand for electricity. They created a program requiring power companies to reimburse customers for some of the cost of replacing light fixtures, air-conditioners and other appliances with more energy-efficient models. The cost of the reimbursement was built into the rates that utilities were permitted to charge.
While homeowners and apartment owners could take advantage of the program, it was aimed especially at businesses, owners of office buildings and other commercial customers, where the substitution of modern equipment can cut energy use by as much as 20 to 40 percent.
In the program's peak years, in 1992 and 1993, power companies statewide spent nearly $300 million a year to help subsidize the purchase of energy-efficient appliances and lighting systems. But then the cutbacks began, first under Gov. Mario M. Cuomo and continuing under Gov. George E. Pataki. Last year, utilities spent $66 million for the conservation effort, according to data compiled by the Natural Resources Defense Council.
Other states have spent much more to encourage conservation. Connecticut utilities spent $109 million last year to reimburse customers for buying more efficient equipment, and power companies in New Jersey spent $230 million, according to the Natural Resources Defense Council. In California, utilities spent $415 million last year.
"They have all made a much greater commitment to energy efficiency funding than New York does now," said Larry Shapiro, a staff attorney with the New York Public Interest Research Group. "In New York, the program has been mostly dismantled."
State regulators scaled back the program to help reduce electricity rates and as part of a broad restructuring of the industry: moving away from the traditional system, which gave utilities a monopoly on power distribution, and toward a competitive market in which consumers will be able to choose among electricity providers.
In the new system, the regulators believe, the marketplace will encourage efficiency, with some energy companies trying to attract customers by offering conservation services. The State Public Service Commission, which regulates utilities, believes that "innovative, cost-effective energy services will develop in this new competitive market," said David Flanagan, the commission's spokesman.
But many conservationists are skeptical that energy companies and consumers will spend enough on new equipment to curb the growth in demand for electricity. The competitive pressure to keep rates low will make it difficult to increase spending on conservation, they say.
"This was a short-term discretionary cost that they could cut," Ashok Gupta, an economist at the Natural Resources Defense Council, said of the reductions in conservation spending. "It was a bad decision to get some short-term savings. It's like not plugging up the hole in your gas tank because you don't want to spend the money right now.
"The reason we need to do it is that markets don't do it," Mr. Gupta said. "Developers who build the buildings don't care what the energy bill will be."

HEADLINE: A Shaky Pillar in Harlem;
Black-Owned Carver Bank Seeks Solid Financial Base

BYLINE: By LESLIE EATON 

 BODY:
As a symbol of Harlem's economic revival, almost nothing would seem to beat the Carver Federal Savings Bank building on 125th Street. Four shiny stories of stone and brass and skylights, it is a monument to the bank's five-decade transformation from a struggling storefront into a pillar of its flourishing community -- and the largest African-American financial institution in the country.
But the bright facade is deceiving. In the last few years, Carver has been beset by almost every problem a bank can face, including fire, fraud and deadbeat borrowers. It has annoyed customers, infuriated shareholders and angered some community leaders. And it has lost a lot of money -- $4.5 million in the last fiscal year alone. 
 Now a new president, Deborah C. Wright, 41, must try to bring into the 21st century an institution that she concedes is about 15 years behind the times -- and whose last effort to modernize ended in financial disaster.
And she may not have much time. Kevin Cohee, a rival banker from Boston who has proposed merging his black-owned bank with Carver, plans to run for a seat on the Carver board at the annual meeting later this year.
"There are a lot of folks with very different visions of what this bank should be," Ms. Wright said recently. But, she added, "they are really all pressuring us to the same place" -- profitability.
To many people in Harlem and the other neighborhoods the bank serves, Carver's history -- and its survival as an independent, black-run bank -- mean a lot. "It is a very important institution both in terms of practicality and in terms of its symbolism," said the Rev. Calvin O. Butts 3d, pastor of the Abyssinian Baptist Church in Harlem, who got his home mortgage from Carver.
Whether Carver can recover will have implications far beyond New York. While they are writ large at Carver, the bank's problems are shared by many other minority-owned financial institutions, which tend to be small, conservative operations serving rural or inner-city neighborhoods.
The reluctance of these banks to take risks -- a trait that served them so well during tough times, including the savings and loan crisis of the early 1980's -- has become a handicap in the rapidly changing world of banking. Merely providing a place for people to park their money is no longer enough.
In the 1990's, bank customers expect instant access to their money, which requires expensive investments in technology. Big banks, forced by Federal law to lend money in inner cities, have discovered that they can make money there, and loom as formidable competitors to Carver on its own turf.
The competition is only getting tougher as banks merge or team up with brokerage and insurance concerns. Indeed, Congress has passed legislation meant to remove many of the regulations that have governed banking since the Great Depression, further blurring the line between savings banks like Carver and other financial institutions, like commercial banks and brokerage firms.
This brave new world has been hard for many banks, but minority-owned institutions have particular problems, said William M. Cunningham, president of Creative Investment Research in Washington, a company that monitors minority-owned financial institutions. "They're too small, their costs are too high, and there's not a lot of innovation or vision about using the resources they have."
 
Survival, Not Growth, Has Been the Challenge
That caution can be explained by their history. Born in the days of Jim Crow or in the early years of the civil rights movement, black-owned banks and savings and loans were for decades the only financial institutions serving their communities. They may not have had much competition, but neither did they have many financial resources.
"Growth hasn't always been the issue -- survival has," said Dina Nichelson, president of the American League of Financial Institutions in Washington, a trade association for minority-owned savings and loans. The number of savings institutions run by black, Hispanic or female managers has dwindled, she said, from more than 100 two decades ago to no more than 40 today.
Like many of these banks, Carver has been a prisoner of its past. It opened on 125th Street in 1949 with the backing of the cream of Harlem's black businessmen, as well as clergymen like the Rev. M. Moran Weston of St. Philip's Episcopal Church on 134th Street.
The founders stuck around for decades. Father Weston and Richard T. Greene, the longtime bank president, did not retire from the board until 1997, when both were well into their 80's. When it came time to pick new board members, they favored civic leaders like David N. Dinkins, the former Mayor, over businesspeople or bankers.
Innovators they were not. Carver did not get its first automated teller machine until 1989 -- long after they had become commonplace at other banks -- and its idea of advertising was mailing out a calendar.
Even worse than change, in board members' minds, was risk. Banks make most of their money -- and take most of their risk -- making loans. Carver made almost no loans, except to churches. Instead, like many other minority-owned banks, it simply accepted deposits and invested them in money market funds and mortgage securities, generating consistent but small profits.
The bank's caution only intensified in late 1990, when neighboring Freedom National Bank, then one of the largest black-owned banks in the nation, failed after having expanded too aggressively.
The memory of depositors lined up on 125th Street to try to get their money out of Freedom haunted Carver's board members, said David R. Jones, who joined the board in 1989 and is now its chairman. Mr. Jones, a former city official who is president of New York's oldest family welfare organization, the Community Service Society of New York, has had an account at Carver since he was a child.
In 1992, Carver started having serious problems of its own. A fire destroyed the bank's headquarters, forcing customers to take shuttle buses from Harlem to an office far downtown, in Chelsea, or to use branches as far away as Bedford-Stuyvesant in Brooklyn or St. Albans in Queens.
Meanwhile, Mr. Jones said, regulators began to complain that Carver had too little capital. The bank's board for once decided to do the financially fashionable thing -- sell shares in the bank, which had been owned by its depositors, to the public.
Ms. Wright, now the bank president, recalled being appalled by the news. She worked on Wall Street for three years in the 1980's. "I didn't think they had any idea of the vast difference in what would be expected in terms of reporting, or of the rigor of focus on performance," she said, adding that she visited Father Weston, the bank's chairman, to beg him not to take it public.
 
Plunging Shares And Serious Missteps
But the deal went forward anyway. In 1994, the year Carver went public, it made headlines when its shares plunged instead of soaring like those of most newly public savings and loans, as investors looked askance at its poor profitability and low levels of lending. The bank took a $250,000 charge in November to settle a class-action lawsuit brought by investors who claimed that they had been misled when the bank went public.
Even after raising more than $20 million through the stock sale, the bank was still making very few loans. To this day, Federal regulators rate Carver's community reinvestment activity as only satisfactory, rather than the "outstanding" rating that they give big mainstream banks like Chase, which has three branches on 125th Street.
Some Harlem leaders contend that Carver has not kept up with the changes in the communities it serves, as the middle-class families with Caribbean backgrounds -- like those who founded the bank -- were displaced by immigrants from Africa, the Dominican Republic, Mexico and the West Indies. Carver "did not keep up with changing times, did not go where the people were," said Lloyd A. Williams, president of the Greater Harlem Chamber of Commerce, whose grandparents were charter depositors at the bank.
The bank did start to change under Thomas L. Clark Jr., a former state banking regulator who became president of Carver in 1995. It began to make mortgage loans, and it bought loans originated by other banks. These moves were expensive, but they increased earnings over time.
But there were serious missteps. A new finance official was arrested on Federal charges of defrauding the bank; a resolution of the case is pending. A new computer system faltered and cost millions of dollars to fix. Grand plans to expand in Westchester County never came to fruition.
The worst mistake was a disastrous foray into credit cards, auto loans and other consumer lending. These areas are not intrinsically unprofitable; some banks make big money in them. But Carver lacked the staff, savvy and resources to do so, and an unusually high percentage of its borrowers defaulted on their loans.
The board fired Mr. Clark in January; he is now a senior executive at E. G. Bowman, a black-owned insurance brokerage in Manhattan. Mr. Jones said the board had agreed with Mr. Clark's strategy but not with the way he had carried it out.
Loan losses and computer costs forced Carver to take a $7.8 million charge in the previous fiscal year, which more than wiped out its earnings. It ended its fiscal year on March 31 with a loss of $4.5 million. Shortly thereafter, regulators sharply downgraded the bank's safety and soundness rating, and restricted its ability to make loans.
"This is like a soap opera that compressed everything that would happen to a bank into three or four years," said Mr. Jones, the board chairman.
 
A Leap of Faith, And Dreams of Success
After an extensive search by a recruiting firm, Carver's board decided to hire Ms. Wright as the new president; she took over on June 1. One of her chief assets, Mr. Jones said, was her ability to put together strong teams of people without offering top salaries. She served as the city's Housing Preservation and Development Commissioner before becoming president of the Upper Manhattan Empowerment Zone in 1996, and she had a good reputation in Harlem and among nonprofit groups.
What she lacks is experience in commercial banking; indeed, she lacks commercial experience of any kind, as Mr. Cohee -- the Boston banker who was once her classmate at Harvard -- likes to point out.
The board "took a leap of faith on me," Ms. Wright said candidly.
She said she hoped to make the bank better at serving people like her, who would like to have accounts there if the services were as good as those at other banks. She would like the bank to advise local businessmen and women, not just on raising money, but on finding successors to run their companies. And she dreams of serving customers who are uneasy about banks but who must increasingly deal with electronic paychecks and benefits and tax refunds.
But she sounds pragmatic: "We can't serve those people if we don't have our act together."
The shareholders, however, may not be willing to wait. The bank's historically poor financial performance has meant that, during the greatest stock market surge in American history, the price of Carver's shares has actually fallen, from $10 in late 1994 to $8.25 as of Friday.
At the last two annual shareholder meetings, more than a quarter of those who voted favored a shareholder's proposal to try to sell the bank. The shareholder, Joseph Sonnenberg, a Manhattan retiree who lives off his investments, said he planned to offer the proposal again this year. The bank, he said, "has to prove a lot and I don't want to wait around that long."
He is not the only one. Martin J. Whitman, one of Wall Street's most seasoned investors, is Carver's biggest shareholder, with almost 10 percent of the shares. "The African-American community needs some way to have a financial institution to call their own," he said. But he added, "Obviously I have no reason to be terribly supportive of the old board or the new C.E.O."
Then there is Mr. Cohee, who owns about 7 percent of Carver's shares and wants to join the board. He said he was not married to the idea of merging Carver with his Boston Bank of Commerce, which is much smaller but far more profitable. But things need to change, he said.
"I have a responsibility as an African-American who runs a community development institution and knows what impact this type of institution has on its community to see that the bank is strong enough to support the dreams and aspirations of its community," he said. "If it isn't in a position to be effective, many people are hurt by that failure."
No one is predicting that the bank will fail; for one thing, Federal regulators now have a mandate to preserve minority-owned institutions. But whether Carver can stay independent and thrive is unclear, especially if the economy turns sour or interest rates rise.
Other minority-owned banks around the country, facing many of the same problems and faced with the need to raise money that Carver had in the early 1990's, are watching the bank carefully, hoping that it will become a successful prototype for the minority-owned bank of the future. "They're sort of paving the way in a lot of areas right now," said Bob Adkins, senior vice president of the Broadway Financial Corporation, which owns a $140 million minority-run savings bank in Los Angeles.
And even those who have sometimes been unhappy with the bank are rooting for it now. "Carver is critical to the growth and development of Harlem, the Harlems of New York City," said Mr. Williams of the Chamber of Commerce. "And if you believe Langston Hughes, as goes Harlem, so goes black and Hispanic America."

HEADLINE: A Khrushchev Is Pledging New Allegiance

BYLINE: By FRANCIS X. CLINES 

DATELINE: PROVIDENCE, R.I., July 8

 BODY:
Four decades after his father, Nikita S. Khrushchev, provocatively vowed from the Kremlin, "We will bury you," Sergei N. Khrushchev awaits American citizenship, happily prepared to pledge allegiance to the United States as its newest patriot.
"Sure," said Sergei Khrushchev with a wisp of merriment in his blue eyes that recalled no one so much as his father. 
 "This is a great country and it's an honor to live here," the 64-year-old son of the late Soviet Premier declared this week. "They will tell me what to do.
"I will do everything as they say," he added with a patient smile, speaking of the citizenship ceremony and the universal ways of bureaucracy.
Now a scholar of the cold war whose lectures at Brown University here are driven by eyewitness memories, Mr. Khrushchev had been a rocket and computer scientist in his father's heyday and a firm believer in Communism. But on Monday, in a red-white-and-blue ceremony off Cathedral Square here, Mr. Khrushchev will stand and be sworn with other new Americans, including his wife, Valentina Garlenka, in a most personal postscript to the cold war years of his father.
Nikita S. Khrushchev had barnstormed America with his son at his side at the height of the cold war 40 years ago. "An impression of a great country, but nothing shocking," Sergei Khrushchev said. "More friendly than expected. You smile more than others."
The son, an ardent collector of butterflies, journeyed to such exotic places as Brooklyn in adding to his collection, while the father hammered away -- literally and famously at the United Nations -- at the message that capitalism would some day be defeated by Communism.
"Of course, you use only that expression about 'bury,' " said the son with a smile, talking from a perspective somewhere between Moscow and Washington about how his father had referred to economic, not thermonuclear, burial. But the distinction was often lost in fear and outrage on the American side of the Iron Curtain.
But that was then, and now Sergei Khrushchev can enjoy the liberating aftermath as he edits family journals, lectures and writes about the cold war at the university's Thomas J. Watson Jr. Institute for International Studies. "Time does its inevitable work," he wrote in his own memoir a decade ago before he ever imagined becoming an American.
More playful than solemn about his citizenship decision, he keeps a Soviet spy-satellite photograph of Rhode Island pinned to the wall as a symbol of his double-faceted fate, near a cartoon of a grizzled beggar labeled "Expert on Russia."
Outside his tiny faculty office, in which he was interviewed, a poster offers the image and hopeful prediction of his father that after a person's death "the good things will outweigh the bad." Inside, the son tests that hope in his scholarship about the long and at times frighteningly checkered career of Premier Khrushchev. The son dismisses the question of what his father, celebrated for his barnyard candor, might have said about having an American for a son. "It is impossible to move a political figure from one era to another," the scholar said of the dictator. "We only create such fiction in movies."
He came by his scholarly role accidentally, he explained, when someone was needed to edit his father's dictated memoirs. "Then I was interested in missiles and gyroscopes," he said. "But I decided I would work with the society," he added, summarizing a journey that included his father's daring to denounce the horrific abuses of Stalin, his predecessor, and his father's eventual fall in 1964 as he attempted gradual changes in the Soviet system.
When the liberating era of Mikhail S. Gorbachev arrived, Sergei Khrushchev was already more independent-minded in investigating the cold war in detail, and he became fascinated by its "mutual misperceptions." By then, his father had come to be viewed as something of a foreshadowing of Gorbachev.
The son began teaching here in 1991 and last year decided that, with travel to Russia no longer restricted, he would base his life here. "We thought that if you decide to work and live here you have an obligation to be a citizen," he said.
Mr. and Mrs. Khrushchev's three adult sons (and three grandchildren) in Moscow regularly visit.
They have American Dream trappings, living in a house in Cranston.
Lately he is bemused by questions from Americans about whether there is any sense of betrayal in Russia at his change in citizenship. "People over there, really much more than here, they are less under the pressure of old ideology," he said. "They can like America, they can dislike America, but they are not living in the cold war.
"Of course, I heard one of the old apparatchiks call me an 'enemy of the people,' " he added, charmed by the notion.
While his father took long, garrulous walks with his son after his Kremlin work days, he never talked of the raw daily fear of the Stalin terror until after he took power and began denouncing before party leaders the murderous abuses of the masses, Sergei Khrushchev said.
"We were very close," the son said. "He liked to talk and tell these stories. But not everything."
Nina Petrovna, Sergei's mother, who died in 1984, had learned and taught English to her children, so she was able to read her husband's memoir when it was originally published in English. "Now I'm editing my mother's diary," Sergei Khrushchev said. "And she's often saying, 'So many interesting things that my husband never told me.' "
Nikita Khrushchev exemplified the triumphs, sorrows and lethal politics of the Kremlin regime. His first wife died in the harrowing famine of 1921. His son, Leonid, died as a combat pilot in World War II. Sergei was born of the second marriage.
"No 'golden youth' for me," Sergei Khrushchev said, referring to the pampered children of Kremlin leaders. "No playboy. No pocket money. No cars. I went by subway to the university."
He seems particularly proud of these memories as he becomes an American. "Parents warned, 'If you do this or don't do that, you will be like Stalin's son -- the worst example for our family,' " he recalled.
In Moscow, Mr. Khrushchev found that his 15 minutes of infamy was over after his father died in 1971. "They stopped bugging my phone and I told friends I'm not an important person anymore," he said.
"But now my wife's sister tells me the tone of the telephone changes two days before I arrive," he added with a grin at the status of his new life.
Sergei Khrushchev promises that he will worry far more than the average American about the "artificial" and "corrupt" situation in Moscow, where, he says, a stumbling Boris N. Yeltsin recalls the final years of Czar Nicholas 2d before the Bolshevik revolution. "I can't feel I am safe here and not care about all my family and friends there."
More than ever, he stressed, the people need economic hope and progress, an imperative he said his father once angrily conceded beyond Western ears soon after his vow to "bury" capitalism. In facing Soviet military demands for more weaponry, Sergei Khrushchev said, "My father told the generals that, between Communism and capitalism, that system will win that presents the better life to the people."

HEADLINE: Mideast's Ripe Moment

BYLINE: By DEBORAH SONTAG 

DATELINE: JERUSALEM, July 10

 BODY:
As Prime Minister Ehud Barak sets off on an ambitious course to forge a comprehensive peace in the Mideast, he heads out into a region of several aging leaders weary of the logjam of Israeli-Arab hostilities.
It would seem that the moment is particularly ripe for successful negotiations, after hopes were dashed, expectations lowered and relations soured during the tenure of Mr. Barak's predecessor, Benjamin Netanyahu. 
 Even President Hafez al-Assad of Syria is making cooing noises in Mr. Barak's direction. Mr. Assad, 69, and the Palestinian leader Yasir Arafat, also 69, are said to be eager because of their ages and health problems to hammer out deals sooner rather than later.
President Clinton, too, having invested so much time in assisting Middle East peacemaking, is determined to see significant progress during his final year in office.
Whether this confluence of interests translates into the dawn of a new peacemaking era, erupts into violence or fizzles into a new stalemate of intransigence remains to be seen. Many who believe in peace see this as a moment of very positive expectations, but history also teaches that skepticism or wariness is in order.
"This minuet of peace is by no means a foregone conclusion," Abraham H. Foxman, director of the Anti-Defamation League, said this week during one of his frequent trips to the region to see Israeli and Arab leaders.
A highly decorated former general who won a resounding mandate at the polls, Mr. Barak, 57, is certainly diving straight into the maelstrom. He set off on a whirlwind diplomatic tour two days after moving into the Prime Minister's office on Wednesday.
On Friday in Alexandria, he saw President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt, who almost effusively endorsed the new Prime Minister as a man of peace. On Sunday afternoon, Mr. Barak is scheduled to hold his first meeting with Mr. Arafat at the Erez checkpoint between Gaza and Israel.
Late Tuesday night, he is supposed to see King Abdullah of Jordan in Aqaba, Jordan. On Wednesday in Jerusalem, he ends his regional meetings by seeing President Suleyman Demirel of Turkey. And on Thursday, he starts a weeklong trip to the United States with a visit to President Clinton at the White House, and then concludes his journey with visits to England and Spain.
From the day he was elected, Mr. Barak has made it clear that he views his most significant mission to be as a warrior-turned-peacemaker, ending, as he often says, "100 years of bloody conflict."
He made it clear by the composition of his coalition that peace, rather than domestic social issues, was his priority. And by the very fact of assembling such a broad coalition -- representing nearly two-thirds of the Parliament -- he communicated that he envisioned making difficult decisions.
"The only reason to put together a coalition that large and unwieldy is so as to be able to absorb blows and defections and still presumably be stable enough to move ahead with territorial concessions," said Joseph Alpher, Mideast director for the American Jewish Committee.
In his inaugural address early last week, Mr. Barak personally addressed Mr. Arafat and Mr. Assad, informing them in a televised address that he wanted to start a new chapter. He spoke a language of empathy rare for an Israeli leader and in stark contrast to the hostility of the last three years.
"I am not only cognizant of the sufferings of my own people," Mr. Barak said, "but I also recognize the sufferings of the Palestinian people."
Mr. Barak has now entered an exploratory phase. A very disciplined strategist, he tends to collect information and review it carefully before devising a plan. No concrete results are expected out of his diplomatic visits, although there could be the announcement in Washington of the scheduling of a meeting with Mr. Assad.
But there are no advance teams and Mr. Barak, who is serving as his own Defense Minister, will not be traveling with a broad entourage of advisers.
"Skepticism could derive from the fact that Barak, who is an unknown quantity, is also very much a one-man show," Mr. Alpher said.
In the next week, Mr. Barak, who says he is seeking to restore trust on all sides, will be feeling out his new peace partners as he tries to compose a plan of action.
"There are expectations of huge progress, but Barak is quite a cautious guy," said Efraim Inbar, a professor at the Begin-Sadat Center for Strategic Studies at Bar-Ilan University. "My theory is that the peace process is very robust. There are great social forces pushing all sides toward minimizing the conflicts. Everyone is tired, and everyone knows he can't realize his dream. The idea of a greater Israel is gone, the idea of a greater Palestine is over, the idea of a pan-Arab nationalism is dead.
"On the other hand, I think everyone is very pragmatic. This liberal notion of trust is pure nonsense. I imagine Barak's aiming for an armed peace at best."
While Mr. Barak has said publicly that he plans to move forward simultaneously on the Palestinian and Syrian tracks, there is a question of pacing. It would be difficult to pursue both at the same time with the same intensity.
Some analysts have predicted that Syria, which represents more of a military threat than the Palestinians, could take priority. Mr. Barak has pledged to withdraw Israeli troops from southern Lebanon within a year and he sees that in the context of a peace agreement with Syria.
"There is a certain neatness to making a deal with Syria that has fascinated several Israeli leaders," said Itamar Rabinovich, president of Tel Aviv University and a former diplomat who headed Israel's delegation to Syria from 1992 to 1995.
"Syria is a state," he continued. "It's always easier to deal with a state than a society or community like the Palestinians. Also, it has an authoritative Government that may be hard to negotiate with, but insures good implementation."
Mr. Rabinovich and other analysts say they believe that Syria has been sending out signals of readiness just as Mr. Barak has indicated that he is prepared to withdraw from most of the Golan Heights in exchange for peace.
"A different type of music is coming out of Damascus," Mr. Rabinovich said. "It is much more inviting, much more positive and much more forthcoming."
Mr. Assad apparently regrets giving up the opportunity to negotiate a peace deal in the early 1990's by taking too hard a line. He held several secret talks with the Israelis during Mr. Netanyahu's Government -- through an intermediary, Ronald Lauder, the American cosmetics businessman. Now he supposedly sees Mr. Barak's Government as a second window of opportunity, and one opening up at a time when Syria's economy is failing and when he is considering passing the reins of authority to his son.
"Syria is partner to the hope of Prime Minister Ehud Barak to put an end to war," the Syrian Foreign Ministry said in a statement last week.
Still, it is unclear how far Mr. Assad is willing to bend. To date, he has been unwilling to make any public gestures to the Israeli people that would send a message of reconciliation. He has been unwilling to open discreet channels of communications that would allow high-level Syrians and Americans, for instance, to take a walk in the woods and establish the parameters of negotiations. And he has been adamant that an Israeli promise to withdraw from the Golan Heights is not something to negotiate but rather the necessary prelude to dialogue.
Nonetheless, while formally Mr. Assad's position remains the same, there have been signs that he is willing to be more flexible. The Syrians have said, for instance, that the redeployment of the Syrian Army is a Syrian decision, which indicates that this is a negotiable subject.
Negotiations with the Palestinians are likely to be far messier and more complex. Mr. Barak committed what the Palestinians consider to be a diplomatic faux pas by waiting weeks after his election to call Mr. Arafat, who is notoriously sensitive and given to such formalities .
Also, Mr. Barak has unnerved the Palestinians by suggesting that they consider delaying the final two phases of the Wye agreement, which was negotiated early last fall in Wye, Md., and suspended late last fall by the Israelis.
Israeli analysts have said that Mr. Barak might pledge future recognition of a Palestinian state in exchange. Mr. Barak acknowledged this strategy publicly for the first time on Friday night. He said, in an Israeli television interview, that he will propose to Mr. Arafat that the two sides defer carrying out the rest of Wye and go straight into expedited final status negotiations and look broadly at all remaining issues.
While the Wye agreement provided interim steps like the return of land and political prisoners, the final status negotiations are supposed to conclude the peace process, resolving the most sensitive issues, like Jerusalem, borders and refugees.
If Mr. Arafat objects, Mr. Barak says he will move quickly on the Wye agreement.
The Palestinians view the idea of postponing the execution of the Wye agreement with great trepidation.
"We absolutely, totally and utterly reject even the idea, or the mere thinking about it, and we urge Mr. Barak not even to suggest if he means and intends to build trust," said Saeb Erekat, the chief Palestinian negotiator.
Mr. Erekat said the Palestinians are impatient and want to see Mr. Barak take quick action. They expect a quick handover of land, a return of Palestinian prisoners and a total change in atmosphere.
"We don't want to wait anymore," he said. "We are tired of waiting."

HEADLINE: U.N. Poverty Agency Vying With Aid Offices for Cash

BYLINE: By JUDITH MILLER 

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, July 9

 BODY:
Mark Malloch Brown, the new chief of the United Nations Development Program, had barely moved into his spacious office with its panoramic views of the East River and the United Nations when he got some bad news: Denmark and Germany, mainstays of his agency's $2 billion budget, were slashing their annual contributions.
The German Cabinet, citing its obligation to limit its budget deficit under Europe's single-currency agreement, announced that it was cutting its contribution to the world body's main foreign aid arm by 50 percent, or $25 million. Denmark, too, announced a 23 percent cut to finance a pledge it had made to rebuild Kosovo. 
 Indeed, the Kosovo crisis has intensified the already fierce competition for dollars among relief and development agencies and makes it all the more likely that the search for funds will consume much of Mr. Malloch Brown's tenure.
The decline in contributions, which are voluntary rather than mandatory like United Nations dues, are not limited to Denmark and Germany. America's portion of the budget has been dropping, too.
In a recent issue of the journal Foreign Affairs, James Gustave Speth, an American who headed the agency for six years before Mr. Malloch Brown took over on July 1, called Washington's donations "particularly stingy." While Nordic countries contributed about $16 per capita to the agency, Mr. Speth complained in a recent interview, America's per capita contribution stood at 50 cents.
In announcing his country's reduction, Poul Nielsen, Denmark's Development Minister, who had been Europe's candidate for the job of leading the agency, denied that the cut was what a Danish journalist called a "devious" act of "revenge" for not having won the post.
While Mr. Malloch Brown declined to discuss Denmark's motives in an interview last week, he expressed his "alarm" that a country with such a long history of generous giving to the world's poor would "tax Africa to fund Kosovo." Denmark, he added, underscoring his concern, risked setting "a dangerous trend" that he hoped other donors would not follow.
As for Germany, the new administrator, as the agency's chief is known, vowed to "fight" the Cabinet's decision through friends in the German Government and, if necessary, reverse the planned cuts in Parliament, which is expected to consider the issue this fall.
Mr. Malloch Brown framed the challenge to get more money for his agency as primarily one of marketing. Employing the free-market jargon so fashionable in the development community these days, Mr. Malloch Brown stressed the need to promote his agency's "comparative advantage" in advancing development through "good governance."
Projects that foster democratic, honest, responsible government, the rule of law, competent, unbiased judicial systems and commercial codes, private organizations and partnerships between government agencies and commercial and nonprofit partners made aid dollars go further, he said.
Mr. Malloch Brown, who was previously vice president for external affairs at the World Bank, said he intends to use his communication skills to enhance his agency's reputation and promote its credibility.
While he praised his predecessor, Mr. Speth -- who is now the dean of Yale University's School of Forestry and Environmental Studies -- Mr. Malloch Brown's emphasis on giving the agency a higher profile seemed to imply that Mr. Speth had been less than successful in this regard.
The Development Program has almost 6,000 employees in 130 offices throughout the world and disperses more than $1.9 billion of its $2.2 billion budget to help fight poverty and underdevelopment. Recently, Mr. Malloch Brown gave his far-flung team a pep talk, delivered via audio and video-conferencing. He warned the staff that to continue being a "relevant" player in development, the agency had to "reinvent" itself.
Articulate, energetic and experienced in relief work, the 46-year-old British national was a popular choice among American officials and many relief workers, who felt that Mr. Speth had placed too little emphasis on integrating emergency assistance into long-term development aid.
But the Europeans, increasingly resentful of the United States for failing to pay the $1.6 billion in back dues it owes the United Nations, had campaigned intensively to lead the agency, and Secretary General Kofi Annan's selection of Mr. Malloch Brown, a long-time associate, caused a diplomatic stir.
Mr. Malloch Brown's World Bank background is the source of another concern. Some fear that the bank, which lends $22 billion of development aid a year, may come to dominate the agency's activities.
Mr. Malloch Brown vowed that he would not permit the World Bank to "swamp" his agency. But, he added, it was an "open secret" that he expected to be judged partly "by my relationship with the World Bank." He urged development proponents not to think of the relationship as a rivalry for clout, but rather as an "opportunity for partnership."

HEADLINE: Will Profit Motive Cure Poverty?

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Your July 7 news article on President Clinton's tour of the country's poorest areas says his fundamental message is that "nothing motivates business like the prospect of profits." These areas may well be poverty- stricken because of the truth of the message. Businesses may have abandoned them because the prospects for profits are dim, even with tax credits and loan guarantees. 
 Corporations are not driven by humanitarian concerns, but President Clinton sounds as if he is. If he truly wants to insure that these communities have decent-paying jobs, why not mandate that new Government offices and such -- for example, the centers that process Government records -- be constructed where unemployment is highest?

To the Editor:
President Clinton's pilgrimage to the poorest parts of the United States (news article, July 7) is heartwarming. But in his rush to fight endemic poverty, does he run the risk of causing yet another "rush to the bottom"? What a wonderful chance for businesses to locate where they might not be bothered by such irksome trivialities as decent wages and union contracts. 
 Could Appalachia become this country's own maquiladora area, where the destitute are glad to get any kind of a job at any price? What looks like a bonanza for industry could be another nail in the coffin of organized labor and decent conditions.

HEADLINE: Will Profit Motive Cure Poverty?

 BODY:

To the Editor:
It is nice to finally have some policy-oriented discussion about impoverished areas in the United States. Yet the message coming out of President Clinton's "poverty tour" -- that poverty can be alleviated by enticing private investment through tax incentives -- gives me pause (news article, July 7). 
 To hear a Democratic President tell the people of East St. Louis, Ill., that nobody, including the Government, will invest money in impoverished areas "if they think they're going to lose it" shows just how much the Democratic Party has swung to the right.
Will espousing the Wall Street euphemism of "emerging markets" in East St. Louis or eastern Kentucky really address the needs of the people in such places?
What the people in these areas really need are sustainable jobs, living wages and affordable health and child care.

In Wine Country, Can White or Red Ever Be Green?

BYLINE: By ALAN KRAUSS

DATELINE: ST. HELENA, Calif.

 BODY:
FARMERS and vintners in California's Napa Valley have long exploited the region's combination of soil, climate and topography to make wines that can compete with those of the great Bordeaux estates. Shrewd marketing and a robust economy have given premium Napa wines a romance and prestige that help lift sales of wine produced throughout the state.
Napa winemaking has proven so successful, in fact, that there is very little land left on the valley floor to plant new vines. To expand output, the wineries are planting on the surrounding hillsides, arousing a backlash driven by environmental concerns ranging from water pollution caused by soil erosion and pesticides to the destruction of oak trees and wildlife habitat. 
 Pushed by environmentalists, the Napa County Board of Supervisors has already enacted regulations aimed at curbing hillside vineyards, and the board's five elected members are being pressed by constituents to make the rules even more restrictive.
Winemakers say hillsides are not only the last available land for Napa vineyards but also the best land for producing world-class wine grapes -- though the most expensive to develop. At the very least, they say, the new rules would drive development costs even higher. Planting a new hillside vineyard costs $35,000 to $40,000 an acre, on top of the price of the land.
"We need to conserve habitat," said Chris Malan, a county mental health counselor who leads Concerned Citizens for Napa Hillsides, a small but politically vocal environmental group. "We need to protect our tree canopy. We need to not construct infrastructure in the hillsides that causes flooding."
Napa County's landmark 1991 hillside ordinance permits farming on slopes with grades as steep as 22.5 degrees, or 50 percent, meaning the land rises one foot for every two horizontal feet. Ms. Malan wants the county to tighten that limit to 30 percent. Better still, she said, would be a moratorium on all new vineyard development. "This is a very small county," she said. "We have to reach the limit at some point."
Because of Napa's national reputation, the fight has attracted attention from environmental groups across the country. They say they will not hesitate to intervene if measures to clean up the Napa River and protect wildlife seem inadequate.
"If it's just a matter of saying, 'We're going to do some study and crack down on future development,' then that won't solve the problem," said Bruce Hamilton, conservation director for the Sierra Club. "California, using Federal standards, classified the Napa River as impaired in 1987. If the state fails to act, then the Federal Government could step in.
"And if neither acts," he added, "then a private group like the Sierra Club could," by going to court.
Winemakers say county figures show that soil erosion has declined by more than two-thirds since 1991. "Many of us think the current ordinance is pretty damn good and the problem is enforcing it," said Dennis Groth, president of Groth Vineyards in Oakville.
The wine growers cautiously embraced recommendations by a county task force that recently evaluated Napa's hillside ordinance. The task force, whose members included winemakers and environmentalists as well as engineers and government officials, rejected proposals like a moratorium on new vineyards and extending the rules to cover replanting of existing vineyards grandfathered under the 1991 law. Instead, it called for further study.
Compliance with the law is largely voluntary; enforcement is limited to responding to the public's complaints, according to county officials. The number of vineyards that break the rules, while thought to be small, is not known.
Still, the problems that have come to light have been damaging for the winemakers. "When somebody violates the law, the finger points at all of us," said Thomas Shelton, chief executive of Joseph Phelps Vineyards and president of the Napa Vintners Association. "Enforcement of existing regulations is something we can all agree on."
Some in Napa say that planting hillsides does not make economic sense anyway.
"The issue is not growth; the issue is profit," said Volker Eisele, a vintner and grape grower with 60 acres who is also an environmental activist. "When land values and business values climb to such astronomical heights, there is a lot at stake." For what it now costs to develop hillside vineyards, he said, "to make such a venture pay, you're looking at a $60 to $80 bottle price, and I have trouble believing that you can project that kind of price into the future."
Mr. Eisele said the Napa industry should grow by increasing quality, not quantity.
For Stuart Smith, whose 30-acre Smith-Madrone Vineyards and Winery lies nearly 1,000 feet above St. Helena in the Mayacamas Range, growth is very much an issue. Mr. Smith, who is seeking county permission to convert six and a half more acres into vineyards, says modern agricultural techniques can minimize soil erosion and habitat loss. And no one should underestimate nature's resilience, he said.
He pointed to a faded redwood stake, one of many he has found on his property, that supported a grapevine more than a century ago. The tall pine trees and scrub that now surround it are evidence of the forest's regenerative vitality, he said.
"The forest wants to take back the vineyards," Mr. Smith said. "It's a constant battle for us to keep the forest at bay."

 CORRECTION:
An article on July 11 about a dispute between winemakers and environmentalists over development of hillside vineyards in Napa County, Calif., misstated the degree equivalent of a slope of 50 percent, the steepest on which farming is permitted by a county land use ordinance. It is 26.6 degrees, not 22.5.

HEADLINE: The Man Who Would Be President

BYLINE: By Michael R. Beschloss; Michael R. Beschloss, author of "Taking Charge," the first volume of a trilogy on Lyndon Johnson's White House tapes, is writing a history of the Lincoln assassination.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
From a Cabinet member's diary on the eve of a Presidential campaign: "The Vice President is becoming more and more truculent. . . . He would interrupt and say to the President, 'Well, didn't I tell you so?' 'You remember I brought that up two or three years ago.' . . . The breach is evidently widening."
The diarist was Harold Ickes, Franklin Roosevelt's Interior Secretary, writing in 1939 about the growing friction between Roosevelt and his Number Two, John Nance Garner of Texas, who had come out against a third term for his boss and was planning to run for President. (Roosevelt observed that his whisky-loving Vice President had "thrown his bottle into the ring.") 
 Now once again there are strains between a President and a Vice President who wants his job. Advisers to Bill Clinton are making it known that he is "angered" and "hurt" by Al Gore's efforts to separate himself from his boss; they say that the relationship has never been so tense. Mr. Clinton, The New York Times reported, was especially irked by Mr. Gore's comments that the President's behavior in the Monica Lewinsky episode was "inexcusable" and that he felt Mr. Clinton had compromised the dignity of the Presidency.
Earlier in American history, most Vice Presidents had no higher ambitions and saw no need to differentiate themselves from the Presidents they served. But in the 60 years between Garner's declaration of independence and Mr. Gore's, every single Vice President has sought the Presidency. Thus the need for modern Vice Presidents to profess stalwart loyalty for their bosses while proclaiming how breathtakingly different they will be when they are Chief Executive.
For Mr. Gore, this stance may prove even more difficult than for some of his predecessors. Mr. Clinton has given him a gift that no other Vice President in this century has enjoyed: a sitting President has endorsed his Number Two at the outset of a contested Presidential nominating process.
President Clinton has ample reason to insure that he is succeeded by someone of his own choosing. Members of Congress and other political leaders are less likely to ignore a second-term President as a powerless lame duck if they face the chance that his chosen heir might be President for an additional eight years, with many of the same people and programs in place, in a position to kick derrieres and take names.
Richard Nixon knew this when he abruptly decided, in the spring of 1971, that his designated heir should be John Connally, a conservative Democrat and former Texas Governor who had served for only several months as Nixon's Treasury Secretary and whom Nixon scarcely knew. Nixon thought Connally would serve as a bridge to conservative Democrats and make the Republicans a majority party. But when Nixon demanded Connally for Vice President after Spiro Agnew resigned in 1973, he was told that the Texan could not be confirmed.
Moreover, an unfriendly successor can make life unhappy for a recently retired President. When Roosevelt defeated Herbert Hoover, he effectively exiled him from Washington and used the power of his bully pulpit to cast Hoover as the enemy of prosperity and fairness. After John F. Kennedy took office from Dwight Eisenhower, one Eisenhower official complained that "virtually everything" that Ike had accomplished had been "brought into question or downgraded."
Despite the obvious benefits, few Presidents have tried to shape their succession. Eisenhower, distrustful of Nixon, tried in 1955 to get him out of the Vice Presidency by offering him a Cabinet post. Nixon refused, and Eisenhower lacked the stomach to force him out. Milton Eisenhower, his brother and confidante, grumpily observed to me in 1983 that "a more sensitive man" would have taken the hint and quit the 1956 ticket: "But he thought this was his chance to be President."
Lyndon Johnson was a textbook case of a commanding President unable to manage the succession. Throughout 1968, Johnson was torn. He allowed that Hubert Humphrey had been a devoted, "A-plus" Vice President. He recoiled from the alternatives -- Robert Kennedy, Eugene McCarthy, George McGovern. But Johnson was furious at Humphrey's private doubts over the Vietnam War and carped that "Hubert cries too much." Although convinced that he had not long to live, he flirted with having Democrats at Chicago "draft" him for another term.
At the same time, Johnson urged New York's Governor, Nelson Rockefeller, a fellow champion of big government and dear friend, to seek the Republican nomination. Had Rockefeller defeated Nixon, Johnson might have stayed neutral during the fall campaign.
Johnson even vacillated over Nixon. Although he knew that Nixon was likely to gut his beloved Great Society, he wondered whether Nixon might be better for the country than Humphrey. At a 30-year reunion of the Johnson Administration at the L.B.J. Ranch in May, Joseph Califano, a close Presidential aide, told me that he still does not know whom Johnson really supported in 1968.
In retrospect, Johnson clearly should have swallowed his reservations about Humphrey and insured the election of a liberal Democrat who would have expanded his programs.
Presidents aren't the only ones with such problems. Tensions between a President and an ambitious Vice President run both ways. In 1960, for example, although Nixon ran as the heir to one of the most popular Americans in history, he responded to Kennedy's critiques of Eisenhower lassitude in military spending and economic growth by showing how he would be a better President than Ike.
Concerned for Eisenhower's health and determined to win the White House on his own, Nixon refused to ask the war hero to traverse the country for him. Wounded, angry, slumping his shoulders in a Nixon impersonation, Ike growled to intimates, "He sure looks like a loser to me!"

In 1979, Walter Mondale, who hoped to succeed Jimmy Carter, privately agonized over his boss's fiscal conservatism and his irritation with labor unions. At least by one account, he considered resigning.
George Bush played the good soldier as Vice President, but Ronald Reagan refused to intervene in the 1988 primaries and endorsed him only after he had locked up the nomination on his own. But that lack of support freed Mr. Bush from any major obligation to his old boss. Thus Mr. Reagan should not have been so startled when Mr. Bush promised a "kinder, gentler America" and went on to systematically uproot many of the Reagan policies and personnel.
History suggests that conflict between the President and the Vice President is inescapable. And as the campaign grinds on, even with so polite a Vice President as Al Gore and a President who understands that extreme measures may be required to get a congenial successor elected, we are likely to see frictions between the two men grow.

HEADLINE: Can Hillary Speak for New York?

 BODY:
Hillary Rodham Clinton seems set on running for the Senate from New York, and many people are asking how well someone who has not lived in the state could represent it. Mrs. Clinton acknowledged the issue last week when she said, "I think I have some real work to do to get out and listen and learn from the people of New York and demonstrate that what I'm for is maybe as important -- if not more important -- than where I'm from." 
 Below, some experts give their views on the question, "Are Hillary Clinton's politics the same as New York State's politics?"
 
Mike Wallace is the co-author of "Gotham: A History of New York City to 1898."
Over the long historical haul, New Yorkers have advocated innovative uses of government to build the economy and promote social justice. Upstaters and downstaters alike supported great infrastructural works like the Erie Canal.
We pioneered making social services -- like public universities and public health programs -- available to all citizens. And we used the state to promote equality and opportunities for all New Yorkers, regardless of race, sex, religion, class or national origin. State politicians who have engaged in such creative statecraft include Alexander Hamilton, De Witt Clinton and Fiorello La Guardia.
Would Hillary Clinton fit this lineage? It's hard to say. Her health plan opted for managed care over single payer. Her New Democrat husband spurned big government and shredded the welfare safety net with no apparent dissent from her. She certainly bears the mantle of Seneca Falls and is likely to champion women's rights.
But will she back bold public works projects like a cross-harbor tunnel or a deep-water port in Brooklyn? Will she help the working poor by fostering unionization, higher minimum wages and new job creation? Will she help rescue our budget-starved and unfairly maligned state and city university systems? Time will tell.
 
C. Virginia Fields is Manhattan Borough President.
Education is, hands down, the number one concern of most New Yorkers I meet. For them, Mrs. Clinton's agenda -- smaller classroom size, universal prekindergarten, rebuilding crowded and decrepit schools -- goes down as smooth as an egg cream on a July afternoon.
And the stops she has chosen for her listening tour -- Catskills crossroads, the industrial Mohawk Valley -- demonstrate she's got the brains and grit to show the Democratic flag in New York State's heartland.
 
Alfonse D'Amato represented New York in the Senate for 18 years.
Hillary Clinton does not represent New York because she is not a New Yorker. She created a health care plan that would have cost New York billions of dollars. She has expressed support for the establishment of a permanent Palestinian state that New York clearly opposes. It does matter where you come from because it shapes what you stand for. New York doesn't need an Illinois-Arkansas-Washington Senator.
 
Geraldine Ferraro, a former Representative from Queens, ran for Vice President in 1984.
I know from my experience in Congress that my allies were not automatically my colleagues from New York. Instead my allies were politicians around the country who were committed to the same values that I was. New York politicians who vote with Dick Armey and Tom DeLay are not voting in New York's interests.
It's also a mistake to assume that a candidate from any one section of New York is ready to represent all of the state. After all, Rudolph Giuliani confused the town of Monroe in Orange County with Monroe County 300 miles north. Yet, it seems as if all he wants to talk about is geography. Too bad he's failing his own test!
 
Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is a lawyer for Riverkeepers, a conservation group.
Most states are small enough that personal relationships still count in political life. New York is big and as diverse as America itself, and so our political currency is ideas. Hillary Clinton has all it takes to enter this marketplace.
New York's size and competitiveness have helped produce the 20th century's defining national leader in each political party, Theodore and Franklin Roosevelt, and a host of nationally influential visionaries -- Daniel Patrick Moynihan, Robert Kennedy, Jacob Javits, Nelson Rockefeller and Mario Cuomo. Each had the common traits that New Yorkers admire and that Mrs. Clinton has in spades: the peculiar mix of toughness, idealism, compassion and intellectual rigor.
In great New York tradition, I expect that Mrs. Clinton will beckon the less affluent toward more participation and responsibility while explaining to wealthier Americans that we can't advance ourselves as a community by leaving our poorer brothers and sisters behind.
 
Joseph L. Bruno is New York State Senate majority leader.
No one really knows for sure what Hillary Clinton's politics are. She has never held elective office, is not from New York and has no connection to the state or its people.
If Mrs. Clinton shares the liberal, tax-and-spend politics of Democrats like Mario Cuomo that drove jobs from our state and left us with multibillion-dollar budget deficits, she will fail to win in New York.
The voters of New York State have a lot to learn about someone who spent her life in Illinois, Arkansas and Washington and suddenly claims to have always loved New York.

Blanche Wiesen Cook is the author of "Eleanor Roosevelt: Volume 2, 1933-1938."
Hillary Clinton would do well to reflect on the ideals of another First Lady who considered a run for New York's Senate. Eleanor Roosevelt was outspoken in her quest for a politics of decency and dignity for all people.
"I could give you 100 percent literacy and I could show you the road to full employment," she said. "Try 1 teacher for every 5 students at a decent salary."
She believed that government had only one purpose: to make things better for all people. This is what New Yorkers want, and this is what Mrs. Clinton says she wants.

HEADLINE: TECHNOLOGY: E-Commerce Report;
As women start to use the Internet more for shopping, the prospects sharply improve for on-line retailers.

BYLINE: By Bob Tedeschi 

 BODY:
WHILE the E-commerce engine has been warming up in recent months, it remains fueled largely by the wallets of affluent men and computer geeks. That fuel, however, is about to receive a powerful additive: X chromosomes.
Women are joining the Internet more quickly than ever, nearly erasing the gender gap among the medium's 92 million users. Perhaps more significant for the Internet economy, though, is the fact that the percentage of World Wide Web shoppers who are women has jumped the last 12 months, to 38 percent from 29 percent, according to a Commercenet/Nielsen Media Research study. Industry executives expect that presence to rise quickly in the next year, bringing with it opportunities in several categories and expanding E-commerce as a whole. 
 "The early part of the E-commerce revolution was a revolution of rich white males," said Katherine Borsecnik, senior vice president for strategic business at America Online. "That's changing. And with 80 to 85 percent of household spending controlled by women, the total retail dollars involved in that change is very high."
Of course, the immediate impact of that change will be felt in traditional female retail strongholds, said Fiona Swerdlow, an analyst with Jupiter Communications, the Internet research firm. Ms. Swerdlow forecasts that categories like apparel, health and beauty and toys will particularly benefit from a growing presence of women shoppers -- meaning sites like those for Gap, Lands' End, Estee Lauder's Clinique, eToys and Toys "R" Us should benefit.
Not only will these categories benefit from first-time buyers, executives said, but they will also reap the fruits of higher spending from more experienced female Internet shoppers. Indeed, according to a survey by NFO Interactive conducted last week, women who shopped on the Internet in the last year said they planned to spend 20 percent more on line in the next year. The survey gathered responses from 880 United States Internet users -- 437 of whom were women -- who said they had bought goods over the Web in the last 12 months.
Travel and apparel are the most favored purchasing categories for female Internet shoppers, according to the survey. Women shoppers responding to the survey said they planned to spend, on average, $965 on travel and $783 on apparel on line, respectively, on those categories in the next year.
The other on-line categories with the greatest growth potential among repeat buyers, according to NFO, include sports and fitness -- on which the women in the survey said they planned to spend an average of 71 percent more in the next 12 months than in the last. Others were food and drink (a projected spending rise of 27 percent), apparel and accessories (24 percent) and home and garden (13 percent).
"I've always said the Internet would take off when women came on line, and it's true," said Marleen McDaniel, chief executive of Women.com, which offers information, shopping and advertising directed toward women. Women.com has catered to what Ms. McDaniel called characteristic shopping behavior among women -- in particular, a propensity to gather a great deal of information before making a purchase. "Women are avid consumers of information, and shopping is their passion," Ms. McDaniel said.
Given that assumption, the site provides "tons of original content," she said, which women can use to make buying decisions. "We'll have an article on echinacea, within the subject of healing herbs," Ms. McDaniel said. "So we'll have a link next to it for colds, and what about echinacea makes it a remedy. Adjacent to that, we'll have an ad for a pharmacy that sells it. Then users can go to the community section of our site and ask a nutritionist, a woman doctor, when to take it. For advertisers, it's fantastic because you're catching a consumer right in flight."
The payoff is apparent in the site's shopping figures, Ms. McDaniel said. According to @Plan, an Internet research firm, 51 percent of Women.com's audience had made purchases on the Internet in the last six months, more than 10 percentage points higher than the average for women on line.
Retailers are also using gender-specific approaches to cash in on perceived differences in shopping behavior. "We do a lot of things to skew toward women," said Steve Hamlin, vice president of iQVC, which is the on-line arm of the Comcast Corporation's QVC home-shopping TV channel and whose clientele is 70 percent female. "Women enjoy the experience of shopping more than men, and are more willing to look at content and browse the site."
For that reason, he said, areas of the site like the jewelry section and the wedding boutique include more editorial content and advisory features than, for instance, the area devoted to sporting goods.
Mr. Hamlin also said that the site had seen a significant rise in computer electronics purchases by women since it began selling prebundled systems. "Women generally feel less confident when making these kinds of purchases," he said, "so they're more comfortable knowing that a certain scanner goes with a certain computer."
Other sites take a more gender-neutral approach. Fingerhut, the Federated Department Stores subsidiary that wholly or partly owns several Web sites, including Andy's Garage and Mountainzone.com, "doesn't spend a lot of time looking at gender," said Andy Johnson, senior vice president for market development, even though 65 percent of Fingerhut's Internet shoppers are women. "We're trying to create processes to serve individual customers as much as they want, no matter their gender."
Ms. Borsecnik, of America Online, takes a similar view. "A vast majority of what we do has nothing to do with gender," she said, noting that roughly 50 percent of the company's shoppers are women. "Our approach is more of a translation of what works off line to the on-line world."
Because some retail categories that tend to attract women have not yet developed fully on line, the gender impact may not be felt immediately, Ms. Borsecnik noted.
"Categories like house and garden hardly register among on-line shoppers, but off line, 25 to 30 percent of all purchases fall into that," she said. By contrast, Ms. Borsecnik said, music CD's account for 13 percent of all purchases made on America Online, while "music has to be less than 2 percent of off-line purchases."
The growth in women shoppers may speed the maturation process for categories like house and garden, as companies rush to market -- once they know the dollars are there. At the same time, Ms. Borsecnik said, many merchants are already setting up shop in hopes that doing so will give a greater number of women reason to log on, ready to spend. "There's still an element," she said, "of 'build it and they will come.' "

Rogers & Wells Approves Merger With London Firm
Lawyers at Rogers & Wells in New York and Clifford Chance in London approved a merger of their firms, the first combination between major British and American law firms.
The firms' partners also agreed to push forward with plans to merge with Germany's third-largest law firm -- a move that would create the largest law firm in the world in terms of both lawyers and revenue, pushing aside two American giants. Page C13.

Convention Focuses on Diversity
At a convention in Seattle, more than 5,000 minority journalists -- and hundreds more people who train them, hire them and advertise with their news organizations -- spent days debating what news organizations must do to present a more complete picture of their communities. The main goal of the convention was to underscore the importance of increasing the number of minority journalists in newsrooms, but a survey showed that more than half of minority journalists plan to leave the business in the next five years. Some, like Mary Lou Fulton, have already left, in her case for the on-line world, while others think their career prospects are limited. C11.

Big Turnout for Minority Journalists

BYLINE: By FELICITY BARRINGER

DATELINE: SEATTLE, July 10

 BODY:
If the gathering here this week had been a medical convention, it would have been billed as a gathering of experts seeking cures for terminal nearsightedness. More than 5,000 minority journalists -- and hundreds more people who train them, hire them, study their work, make their computers and advertise with their news organizations -- spent days debating what news organizations must do to put the world in focus.
The overarching assumption was that major news organizations will have continuing trouble keeping their audiences. "We need to paint a more complete picture of America," was the way that Catalina Camia, the president of Unity: Journalists of Color Inc., put it at the opening session of the group's second-ever national convention, which brought together members of the National Association of Black Journalists, the Asian-American Journalists' Association, the Native American Journalists Association and the National Association of Hispanic Journalists. 
 The event nearly foundered nine months ago when a faction of the black group said that Washington State was not a fit site because it had passed an anti-affirmative action initiative. But after rancorous debate, the groups voted to keep the gathering in Seattle. So for some, the existence of the convention was a victory. But for many, jobs mattered most.
"More people of color in the newsrooms -- that's the bottom-line goal of all of the four organizations," said Sheila Brooks, a member of the National Association of Black Journalists who is chief executive of SAB Productions , a television and video production company. "But it's not going to change unless we pound and pound and pound." The convention included a job fair at which scores of news organizations interviewed minority candidates.
"We've made at least one hire here -- at least," said Leonard Downie Jr., the executive editor of The Washington Post. Rob Dean, the managing editor of The New Mexican in Santa Fe, with a circulation of 25,000, had not filled the job opening he had, but said he talked to about 15 candidates and is taking six resumes home. Telly Hughes, a recent graduate of Illinois State University who, at 21, is looking for an entry-level job in broadcasting, came away with a fistful of business cards and a head filled with advice. "I can't believe these established people take time to talk to me," he said.
But hovering near the surface of this gathering was the knowledge that, five years after Unity had its first convention in Atlanta in 1995, the number of Hispanic, Native American, Asian and black newspaper journalists has risen to only 11.55 percent from 10.49 percent, for a total of 6,365 journalists out of 55,100 in newspaper newsrooms, according to an annual diversity survey of the American Society of Newspaper Editors.
But in local television stations, minorities in the work force dropped to 19 percent in 1998 from 21 percent in 1996, according to the Radio-Television News Directors Association.
The Census Bureau estimates that 28 percent of the country's population belongs to one of those four minority groups; that figure is expected to reach almost 38 percent by 2025.
Still, the stubbornness of the statistics and the sense at the convention that minority journalists are leaving the profession faster than they can be replaced did not dampen the spirits of some for whom the convention was like a family reunion. Organizers were pleased to see network correspondents and the publishers or editors of the country's five largest newspapers who came to recruit, and three Presidential candidates who addressed the group.
The jam-packed schedule featured multiple seminars by day -- sometimes six at a time -- and multiple parties by night -- at least six at a time. Sponsors included companies like Knight Ridder, Apple Computer Inc. and the Adolph Coors Company.
As the convention started, the Freedom Forum, a foundation based n Washington, released a survey showing that more than half of minority journalists plan to leave the business in the next five years even though 60 percent said that they liked their jobs "very much." Figures for nonminority journalists were unavailable.
The apparent paradox in the survey can perhaps be explained by ex-journalists like Mary Lou Fulton and Ron Funabiki. Ms. Fulton, whose mother is Mexican, describes her eight-year journalism career, mostly at The Los Angeles Times, in tones that mix real gratitude with deep dissatisfaction.
"Newspapers often believe that if you have enough different colored noses in a newsroom, that's going to make a better newspaper," said Ms. Fulton, who was by turns a local reporter and the editor of The Los Angeles Times's short-lived City Weekly. "I think having enough noses is essential, but you also have to have different coverage strategies." She praised the newspaper's new Hispanic desk, saying that earlier coverage of minority communities was one dimensional.
But for all that, she said, nothing could have kept her from the lure of the Internet, which she discovered five years ago after she had received a master's degree in public administration. Now 35, "an old woman" in her new world, she is leaving her job as a vice president for editorial operations of Yahoo's Geocities unit and is being interviewed for top jobs at two Internet start-ups, she said.
Mr. Funabiki, 50, who is Japanese-American, spent twice as much time in the business as Ms. Fulton, but reflected the same mix of satisfaction and frustration. At The San Diego Union, he had some choice assignments, including a self-designed beat covering the economics of the Pacific Rim. But Mr. Funabiki said he felt his career prospects were limited.
"I wasn't really angry or upset, but I wasn't satisfied with things, either," he said. In 1990, after 19 years in the business, he accepted an offer to start a new program at San Francisco State University focused on analyzing mainstream journalism. After five years, he moved to the Ford Foundation as a program officer.
Both Mr. Funabiki and Ms. Fulton came back to Unity this week -- Ms. Fulton as a panelist for a session on high-technology with Vice President Al Gore, and Mr. Funabiki to see how Unity used some of the $400,000 in grants Ford has made to it in recent years.
The reality of attrition, however, is making it hard to keep the minority numbers rising. A recent article in American Editor cited studies showing that journalism schools over all are producing about 750 minority print journalists a year -- exactly the number of people who, like Mr. Funabiki and Ms. Fulton, have been lost to attrition.

HEADLINE: Books' Hero Wins Young Minds;
An Apprentice Wizard Rules the World (at Least Its Bookstores)

BYLINE: By EDEN ROSS LIPSON 

 BODY:
Hannibal Lecter and Harry Potter are shaping up as the summer's must reads. Harry who?
Hannibal the cannibal is the title character of Thomas Harris's grisly new novel who has appeared in two previous novels and two movies. So his place atop the best-seller lists is predictable. 
 But riding broomstick high, right behind the ghoulish Dr. Lecter, is Harry Potter, an orphan wizard with unruly hair and a lightning scar on his forehead. This unusually adept pupil at Hogwarts School for Witchcraft and Wizardry is the hero of two wildly successful British children's novels by J. R. Rowling.
Last week there were 826,000 copies in print of the first novel, "Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," and some 915,000 of the second, "Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets," which was published on June 2. At bedtime, at the beach, by the pool, in the back of the car, whole families are reading about the boarding school where the food is delicious and the equipment list includes a wand and cauldron.
The Potter books are an international phenomenon; in two years the first has been published in 115 countries in 25 languages. The headline in the British newspaper The Guardian on Thursday proclaimed, "Hannibal eaten for breakfast by 13-year-old." The article said that 24 hours before publication of the third book, "Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban," with a first printing of 240,000, it had surpassed "Hannibal" on the Amazon.com.uk charts.
The book went on sale 15 minutes after school ended that afternoon to stampedes of children going from schoolyards to stores. Scholastic Press, the American publisher, plans a national release of that book here on Sept. 7, the day after Labor Day. British wholesalers have been reminded of the territorial rights of British publishers and told not to sell "Azkaban" abroad. But as was the case this spring when the second book was available only in Britain, and E-commerce bypassed copyright, many American readers and bookstores have already ordered copies directly or on the Internet.
All winter and spring teachers and librarians marveled at the speed with which children, particularly "reluctant readers," embraced "Sorcerer's Stone." But the biggest surprise, based on anecdotal evidence, may be the books' combined power to bring boys back to reading. Calls to sleep-away camps for children aged 8 to 15 around the United States early this month suggest that roughly a third of the children had already read them.
American girls, for the most part, have always been readers, have loved series and have been receptive to suggestions for the next book. Boys have always found alternatives to reading: think Tom Sawyer. But adult concern for reinforcing boys' reading skills has intensified in recent years as alternative temptations have burgeoned to include Pokemon, Play Station, computer games or the Internet.
"The Hardy Boys" and the baseball novels of John R. Tunis notwithstanding, the last title genuinely popular with boys, as opposed to one foisted on them by adults, was probably "Hatchet," Gary Paulsen's realistic 1987 novel about a boy stranded for 54 days in the Canadian wilderness. The book and its sequels remain popular paperback titles.
Earlier in the 90's boys read the paperback "Goosebumps" series avidly, but, as Clifford Wohl, a former children's bookseller, put it: "You couldn't get them off that dime. You couldn't say, 'Here's another scary book you might like.' No. They only wanted 'Goosebumps.' It was like a fence, and the boys were trapped within the series."
Boarding school books have been a British export since "Tom Brown's Schooldays" and fantasy worlds since J. R. R. Tolkien's "Lord of the Rings." Contemporary writers successfully working with witchcraft and parallel universes include Diana Wynne Jones and Terry Pratchett, who said recently in The Sunday Times of London that the British were major exporters of imaginary worlds.
The great summer read in the United States 25 years ago, in fact the best-selling adult novel for six months, was "Watership Down," by Richard Adams, a dense fantasy about a rabbit civilization. A children's title in England, the novel was considered so sophisticated here that it was published as an adult book. Today it's a paperback popular on middle-school reading lists.
Although they are widely admired, and read, by adults, there has been no confusion about the Potter books. Susan Hirschman, the editor of Greenwillow Books, who bought "Watership Down," says that Ms. Rowling's achievement in the Potter books is: "She never breaks out of her voice. There's no Roald Dahl bark in the prose, no adult asides."
The fantasy is firmly in the British tradition: the wizards live by rules, hovering above England in a setting quite near reality but not part of it and so clearly described that young readers can map it. Hogworts has required classes in charms and potions, name tags on black robes and on pointed hats; the mail is delivered by owls, and Harry stars in the spectacular airborne school sport called Quidditch, riding his Nimbus 2000 broomstick. And of course there are good and evil.
The plot springs from the fact that Harry's parents were murdered by the dark prince Voldemort, generally referred to as "You Know Who." He and his legion disappeared during the years Harry was in the care of his dreadful human relatives, the Dursleys. Voldemort's followers are reappearing in pursuit of Harry, and he lurks somewhere ahead in future books along with the fevers of adolescence.
 
In the Hammock Or at the Beach
Ordinarily, said Bill McMahon, director of Camp Moosilauke, in Orford, N.H., boys tend to "leave reading a little behind" at camp, though they read every night. This summer, he said, "we are seeing them in the hammock at free time and down at the beach with the books." He noted that European campers there had packed their own editions.
The boys' enthusiasm for Harry Potter is spilling over into other books, many booksellers and librarians say. They cite, for example, "Holes" by Louis Sachar (Frances Foster Books/Farrar Straus & Giroux). This adventure story about Stanley Yelnats (admittedly certified in adult eyes because it is the winner of the 1998 National Book Award and the 1999 Newbery Medal) is selling at nearly twice the expected rate, more than 190,000 copies in five months. At Barnes & Noble, said Steven Geck, the children's buyer, other hardcover fiction for middle-grade readers, especially boys, is selling strongly as well.
Word of mouth, not to mention placement in the front of bookstores because of the best-seller status, has made the Potter books a crossover phenomenon. They are now attracting adult readers here pretty much as they did in Britain, where the second book topped the best-seller lists last year.
Sally Lodge of Wellesley, Mass., said: "I've been a mother for almost 18 years, and never in my parenting career have all three of my children read and even fought over the same book. But then my husband started the first book at the same time the 11-year-old was reading it, and he wanted it reserved for him. So he hid it under his pillow. But she found it."
Juliette Smith, a counselor at Camp Kamaji, a girls camp in Cass Lake, Minn., is reading the first book to 8-year-olds, a chapter a night. "They are silent throughout," she said, "and then say, 'Can we read some more?' "
Ms. Rowling said she imagined the character while riding on a train. She planned seven books, one for each year of boarding school, carrying Harry from just before his 11th birthday when he is summoned to Hogwarts, to graduation. Several years later, while she was an unemployed single mother on the dole, she sat in cafes in Edinburgh writing the first novel in longhand while her infant daughter napped beside her.
Arthur A. Levine of Scholastic, an editor with a keen eye for fantasy, bought the American rights to the first novel after reading advance galleys of the British edition. It was a spirited auction, and the price, $105,000, was the highest then paid for a foreign children's novel.
In consultation with the author Mr. Levine changed the title from "Philosopher's Stone" to "Sorcerer's Stone" and made small editing changes that smoothed out differences in British and American speech. He also added rich paper, a cover illustration and decorative chapter illustrations.
 
Selling Tactics, Not Just for Children
Scholastic -- best known to adults for the paperback series "The Animorphs," "Goosebumps," "Baby Sitters Club" and "Fear Street" -- used the marketing strategies and techniques given to promising adult fiction titles. Barbara Marcus, the executive vice president of the book division, said the strategy included sending nearly 2,000 advance copies to so-called "big-mouth" or influential adults and children. Scholastic placed Harry Potter in all its advertisements and in the fall and holiday catalogues, invested in easel displays and posters and brought Ms. Rowling to the United States. Independent booksellers in particular eagerly "hand sold" the book, recommending it to holiday shoppers.
The first printing was 35,000, with a hefty marketing budget of $100,000. Still, Diane Roback, children's editor of Publishers Weekly, which gave "Sorcerer's Stone" a starred review and an interview, says: "Marketing can only go so far because it's directed at adults. It's the incredible word of mouth among kids that has blown this into a phenomenon."
Scholastic planned to bring out "Chamber of Secrets" in September, a year after the first Harry Potter title, but large numbers of books imported from England forced them to move up the date and then to schedule "Azkaban." Appearing in American stores a week ahead of "Hannibal," "Chamber of Secrets" spent a week as No. 1 on the best-seller list in The New York Times.
 
They Finish One And There's Another
Beth Peffer at the Bank Street College Book Store in Manhattan thinks the almost immediate availability of the sequel helped develop reader loyalty. Often there have been long intervals between installments of many of the best loved American children's books.
Using the example of Jean Craighead George's "Julie of the Wolves," she pointed out: "The original kids outgrew it before the sequel came. We sold that to another generation entirely. But here the sequel is being sold to the initial excitement." A new "Ramona" book by Beverly Cleary will be published this fall; the first was published in 1952, the last 15 years ago. Compare that to three Harry Potter books in a year, something that never occurs in adult publishing.
Ms. Rowling, who will do an American book tour in October, is off somewhere finishing the fourth book. In the future the novels will be published simultaneously in all English-speaking countries.
So where, cynical parents sated by "Phantom Menace" merchandise this summer must be wondering, is the movie? Where are the toys? How can this be just a book? Warner Brothers has the film and merchandise rights to the first book, but there will be a lull before American children see their personal image of Harry replaced by a face on a movie screen or have a chance to buy a certified Nimbus 2000 broomstick.

HEADLINE: Plenty Of Seats Available

BYLINE: By GERALDINE FABRIKANT 

 BODY:
For movie theater owners this summer, it is the best of times and the worst of times.
The summer is shaping up as the best ever at the box office, on the strength of hits like "Star Wars," "Austin Powers" and "The Wild, Wild West," with widely anticipated movies like Stanley Kubrick's "Eyes Wide Shut" still ahead. And filmgoers are flocking to sparkling new megaplexes. Such theater complexes typically have more than a dozen big screens, digital sound systems and so-called stadium seating -- armchairs arrayed in tiers to offer each member of the audience an unobstructed view. 
 "I like the new megaplexes," Gloria Dickerson, a children's book distributor, said enthusiastically as she left a screening last Thursday of the Spike Lee film, "Summer of Sam," at the new Loews megaplex on Second Avenue at East 32d Street in Manhattan. "The seats are comfortable. I think they're wonderful."
In short, for film makers and their audiences, going to the movies has seldom been better. So how come the companies that run the theaters are having such a lousy summer?
The four leading publicly held exhibitor companies -- AMC Entertainment, Carmike Theaters, GC Companies and Loews Cineplex Entertainment -- all lost money in their most recently completed fiscal years, and their stocks are sagging. While the extent of the problem varies among these companies, all are finding themselves on the wrong side of two economic forces: a glut of screens, even with record demand for movie tickets, and a costly unplanned obsolescence for hundreds of cinemas.
Though audiences are flocking to the spacious new megaplexes, people are staying away in droves from many of the so-called multiplexes of shoe-box size theaters that have been a mainstay of shopping malls and a staple of the movie industry for decades.
Because the big exhibitors with the financial clout to erect the new megaplexes are also the largest owners of the fading multiplexes, companies like AMC and Loews tend to be bearing the brunt of the forces they themselves have unleashed. And while analysts predict that the strongest exhibitors will survive the industry's transition from shoe boxes to showcases, few expect the recovery to be swift or smooth.
"It will take another two years before the investments pay off," predicted Christopher Dixon, a media analyst at Paine Webber, who has been bearish on the exhibitor stocks for the past two years.
Scrambling to respond to the public's overwhelming preference for megaplexes, the big theater chains are attempting to convert multiplexes to megaplexes wherever they can. Many of the old multiplexes, however, just cannot be revamped -- especially in shopping malls where there may be little flexibility to expand floor plans and raise ceilings for stadium-style layouts, which require at least twice the height as a conventional theater. In such cases exhibitors may seek to sell the theaters, keep marginally productive theaters open while waiting for their leases to expire or simply close the theaters and take write-offs while building new megaplexes elsewhere.
But none of this is happening fast enough to reduce the current glut of movie screens -- 34,160 throughout the United States. That is approximately one for every 8,000 people in the nation, notes Sumner M. Redstone, who is chairman of the entertainment company Viacom Inc. The number of movie tickets sold each year has risen 40 percent since 1988, to a current rate of over 1.4 billion annually. Unfortunately for exhibitors, the number of screens has increased even more so -- by 47 percent during that same period.
Mr. Redstone, who also personally owns the private exhibition company National Amusements, with some 1,300 screens, says that the United States has become "overscreened." That is why, even as National Amusements has joined the megaplex mania in this country, it is also busily building theaters in less glutted markets like Latin America.
For similar reasons, virtually every American movie exhibition company is investing overseas.
But with the United States remaining the core market for exhibitors, theater companies have little choice but to pour money into the type of theaters that American audiences are now demanding.
"Stadium seating is a breakthrough in the industry," Mr. Redstone said. "Where we have built them, we are doubling and tripling our business. For example, in Cincinnati, where we have a 20-screen stadium seating complex, we are doing three to four times as much business as we did a year ago, before we converted the multiplex."
The megaplexing of America is generally agreed to have begun in 1994 when AMC Entertainment, the nation's largest publicly owned theater chain -- or "circuit," in industry parlance -- opened a megaplex in Dallas, called the Grand. Built after extensive interviews with moviegoers, the Grand was immediately successful and yielded a basic formula that has been widely copied since: 14 or more screens, stadium seating, arm rests that hold drinks and can be tilted up to convert individual seats into a cozy love-seat tandem, a digital sound system and a ceiling-to-floor, wall-to-wall screen.
Such luxurious viewing does not come cheap, though. For Loews, which is building megaplexes with as many as 24 screens and more than 3,000 seats, the construction cost is $1 million a screen -- which does not include the cost of buying or leasing the land. That compares with an old multiplex with 8 to 12 screens, perhaps 2,500 seats and a construction cost of about $600,000 a screen. Loews says that 432 of its screens -- or about a quarter of the company's United States total -- are now in megaplexes and that within the next few years the majority of its screens will be in these new supercinemas.
The chairman of Loews, Laurence Ruisi, says that this fast-track construction schedule accounts for his company's poor results for fiscal 1999, which ended in February. Loews reported a net loss of $5.9 million on sales of $851 million. The deficit came despite a positive cash flow -- earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization -- of $144.2 million. And Mr. Ruisi predicted that it might be two more years before the company returned to profitability.
But then, he promises, Loews's business will be better than ever. "The megaplexes are much more profitable for us," Mr. Ruisi said.
Mr. Redstone, too, describes the new-theater boom as a business for long-term players with deep pockets.
"The reward is terrific, but the capital costs are enormous," he said. "In Revere, Mass., we have the largest-grossing National theater in New England. We are tearing it down, and we are spending about $20 million to build a new 20-screen stadium-seat theater."
A theater chain that does not protect its turf with a megaplex risks losing business, Mr. Redstone said, citing research by National Amusements indicating that audiences will bypass a multiplex closer to home to see a film at a megaplex that is farther away.
But it is not always the case that for each new theater complex built another is torn down.
"Everybody is building new screens, and the old screens are not coming off line as quickly as expected," said Marina Jacobson, who follows the movie exhibition business for the investment firm of Bear, Stearns.
Take the case of the new Loews megaplex on Second Avenue at East 32d Street in Manhattan. The company already owned a three-screen multiplex two blocks away on East 34th Street when it broke ground for the megaplex. Last year, Loews sold the 34th Street multiplex to Clearview Cinemas. That came in response to a ruling from the Justice Department's antitrust division that Loews's acquisition of a separate big theater chain, Cineplex Odeon, had given the company too many theaters in Manhattan. As a result of the transfer of the 34th Street property to Clearview, Loews's new megaplex is competing with a multiplex virtually around the corner.
So far, though, it appears to be the Loews megaplex that is drawing the crowds -- and the new releases. While the Loews lineup last week had a full complement of hits and recently released blockbuster hopefuls (including "South Park," "Wild, Wild West," "Big Daddy," "Tarzan," "Austin Powers," "Summer of Sam" and "The General's Daughter") the nearby Clearview multiplex had only three movies, the popularity of which crested weeks ago: "Notting Hill," "Walk on the Moon" and "The Red Violin."
The industry's "overscreening" gives an advantage to distributors, the middlemen who take Hollywood's films and apportion them among the exhibitors. Distributors and exhibitors divide the box-office gross, with the theater owners getting perhaps only 10 percent of the take when a film first opens but keeping an increasing percentage of receipts the longer the film runs.
Using time-honored formulas that vary slightly depending on who has the most leverage, the exhibitors and distributors generally aim for a 50-50 split over the film's entire run. Right now, though, the leverage is clearly with the distributors, which not only have greater leeway than in the past to pick and choose among local theaters but can also dictate tougher terms. Thus 20th Century Fox, a News Corporation subsidiary, has been able to demand a formula that may allow it to keep a 52 percent share of the take from exhibitors with whom it has favored with copies of its blockbuster "Star Wars."
A year ago, Alan Gould, a movie industry analyst for the investment firm of Gerard Klauer Mattison was bullish on the theater-chain companies. Not now, though; he has lowered his earnings estimates for the entire group.
"We simply didn't realize how fast the cash flow from the multiplexes would decay," Mr. Gould said. "It has been a forced cannibalization. Now, if someone plops down a megaplex, it gets the best movies and the best attendance."
For AMC, Loews and the other megaplex builders, the big issue now is getting rid of their aging multiplexes as quickly as feasible. In many cases, long-term leases at shopping malls and other locations means swallowing big write-offs when the older cinemas take early retirement.
And the alternative of selling the complexes no longer seems as easy as it was as recently as a year ago, when several financial players were still gobbling up theaters. Two leveraged buyout firms, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and Hicks, Muse, Tate & Furst, for example, jointly acquired several chains, now called Regal Cinemas. But they are no longer aggressively buying up properties, and analysts see little hope that other big buyout firms will enter the theater market.
"I think they thought that if they could lead a consolidation in the industry, they would have more clout in negotiating terms of the film studios for movies; but that didn't happen," said a movie studio analyst, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.
But this industry melodrama may yet have a happy ending -- at least for the companies with the financing to build megaplexes. To control their own costs, Hollywood studios are trying -- or so they claim -- to cut back on the number of films they produce each year. Fewer movies would give each new release a better chance of getting more screen time, with the longer runs that favor the exhibitors.
If that trend bears out, and as the least profitable multiplexes are gradually phased out, some analysts expect a return to good times for the theater chains. Michael Wolff, who heads the media consulting business at Booz Allen & Hamilton, predicts that running movie theaters will be an attractive business once the rebuilding is finished.
"These are not comparable to other high-growth industries, but they are a reliable, steady cash-flow business," Mr. Wolff said. "I think the megaplexes will become major entertainment centers."

HEADLINE: The Big City;
Seeing Con Ed In New Light, With Rivals

BYLINE: By JOHN TIERNEY 

 BODY:
IT may not be of much comfort at the moment, but there may soon come a time when Consolidated Edison is unable to plunge large sections of New York City into darkness. Even more incredible, Con Ed could become a popular institution.
Well, maybe "popular" is putting it too strongly. New Yorkers' relationship with Con Ed has been so bad for so long that it will probably never fully recover. A public utility makes the perfect public enemy for both conservatives and liberals: an inefficient creation of the government that is also a giant corporation raking in guaranteed profits off a vital public service. What's not to hate? 
 But Con Ed's monopoly, which is the root cause of the public frustration, will not last forever. New York is one of the many states that has slowly begun deregulating the electricity industry so that customers can shop for power from competing companies. And thanks to new technology, the "small is beautiful" approach to energy now appeals to engineers and economists, as well as to environmentalists.
Neighborhoods like Washington Heights and the Lower East Side, which went dark last week, could in the not so distant future have their own power generators and distribution networks that go on working even when Con Edison's fail. It's already possible for an apartment building to generate all its own electricity with natural gas, using a turbine no bigger than a dishwasher.
Ashok Gupta, senior energy economist at the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental group in New York, sees the model for the future in the new home of Conde Nast in Times Square. The building generates some of its own electricity from solar panels built into the facade and from fuel cells that run on natural gas.
"Just as with computers and telecommunications," Mr. Gupta said, "the power industry is becoming smaller and modular and closer to the customer. There are a host of technologies that allow people to generate their own electricity. You might see a hospital like Columbia-Presbyterian generate its own power and defray some of the capital costs by providing electricity to its neighbors in Washington Heights."
Today, New York faces the prospect of power shortages because electricity consumption is straining the system's capacity. But it is hardly the sort of crisis that loomed in the 1970's, when oil and natural gas supplies were thought to be vanishing. Back then, it seemed impossible to meet the power demand without building large, costly plants, fueled by coal or uranium, that were anathema to environmentalists.
These days, plants can be any size because of advances in turbine design and the abundance of natural gas, which is cheap and clean. Factories are already using gas turbines to generate their own power, and independent power companies are seeking approval from Albany to build natural gas plants to compete with Con Edison.
FOR now, when businesses and homes buy power from Con Ed's competitors, it is still delivered through Con Ed wires. As long as it maintains its monopoly on power transmission and distribution, customers will be vulnerable to the kind of widespread blackouts that occurred last week when Con Ed cables failed.
But there could eventually be other cables. In some cities, like Cleveland, rival companies already maintain separate grids in the same neighborhoods. It may seem impractical to put more power lines under the streets of New York, but other companies already have wires and pipes underground.
"New electric lines could be built by companies that already have rights of way, like the telephone and cable and gas companies," said Jerry Taylor, the director of natural resource studies at the Cato Institute, which has published reports urging the rapid end of all monopolies in the power industry. "It's very easy to imagine a gas company setting up a microturbine in a neighborhood and running electric wires along its pipes into customers' homes. You might be wired up to two grids and choose your service provider like your long-distance telephone provider."
Like AT&T, Con Edison would remain a dominant presence even without its monopoly, but it would not be so unpopular with consumers or such an easy target for politicians. Lily Tomlin's famous line about the phone company -- "We don't care; we don't have to" -- no longer works for long-distance companies. When AT&T's system fails, there isn't a public outcry for official inquiries and new regulations. Its customers can better vent their anger by taking their money elsewhere.

HEADLINE: Unlikely Lobbyist Will Lead H.M.O.'s Into Battle

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 11

 BODY:
When the Senate takes up legislation on Monday to define patients' rights, Democrats will argue that hundreds of people have been injured or even died because they were denied necessary care by cost-conscious health maintenance organizations.
So it is rather surprising to find that the chief lobbyist for the managed care industry is herself a Democrat, a veteran of the trade union movement and a longtime advocate of universal health insurance. 
 The lobbyist, Karen M. Ignagni, has deflected much of the anger that threatened to overwhelm H.M.O.'s just a year ago. She will lead the industry into battle this week, as the Senate holds four days of impassioned debate on proposals to set comprehensive Federal standards for health insurance plans.
It will be the most extensive debate on any health care issue since President Clinton's plan for universal health insurance died on the Senate floor in the summer of 1994.
As president of the American Association of Health Plans, Ms. Ignagni leads a nimble, quick-witted campaign to outmaneuver the Clinton Administration and Democrats in Congress who want to enact a so-called patients' bill of rights, enforceable by lawsuits against health plans that injure patients by denying them care.
In a city teeming with health care lobbyists, Ms. Ignagni is widely considered one of the most effective. She blends a detailed knowledge of health policy with an intuitive feel for politics.
Since taking charge of the association nearly six years ago, she has built up a large stable of health policy analysts and has retained pollsters and political consultants from both parties to repair the tattered image of H.M.O.'s. She has persuaded members of the association to adopt a voluntary code of conduct, which they use to argue that new laws are unneeded.
Ms. Ignagni (pronounced ig-NAH-nee) puts a humane face on an industry reviled by many consumers. Old friends say they are puzzled by the transition she has made from champion of the working class to defender of big business. She now denounces proposals by Democratic members of Congress who were her allies for more than a decade, when she worked at the A.F.L.-C.I.O.
One Democrat on Capitol Hill said, "Karen went from God's right hand to Satan's left hand." A labor union leader said, "She jumped to the other side." Former allies on the left say she has sold out, abandoned principles, become a turncoat.
"She has become part of the enemy, as far as I'm concerned," said Dr. Sidney M. Wolfe, director of Ralph Nader's Health Research Group.
Representative Greg Ganske, an Iowa Republican who supports many of President Clinton's proposals to regulate H.M.O.'s, said: "Karen has one of the more difficult jobs in Washington, defending an industry that has a public relations record similar to that of the tobacco industry. In private conversations, I sense that she is uncomfortable defending the totally irresponsible behavior of some H.M.O.'s."
Ms. Ignagni sees no contradiction. Even as she works to head off legislation defining patients' rights, she insists that she is motivated by concern for low-income workers. Proposed new Federal standards and requirements, she says, would increase the cost of health insurance and make it unaffordable for many workers and small employers.
Ms. Ignagni's adversaries express grudging respect for her. "I just wish she were on our side," said Gail E. Shearer, a health policy expert at Consumers Union. David H. Nexon, the senior health policy adviser to Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts, said, "Karen has revitalized an organization that was somewhat moribund and made it a real player on the Washington scene."
Lobbyists for the association have penetrated the innermost chambers of the Health Care Financing Administration, the unit of the Department of Health and Human Services that runs Medicare. The lobbyists often seem to know more about what is happening at the agency than do senior officials of the department.
The association and its business allies have flooded the airwaves and newspapers with advertisements opposing legislation to regulate H.M.O.'s. Through an umbrella group known as the Health Benefits Coalition, they spent $2 million on advertising last year and have already spent more than that this year, with a new burst of advertising planned for this week.
The advertisements attack the main Democratic bill by name, but provide justification -- and political cover -- for senators to vote against any patients' rights legislation.
At 45, Ms. Ignagni is younger, more informal and more direct than most lobbyists who run big trade associations. Her talk is breezy, but it serves a purpose, frequently disarming her opponents.
Most H.M.O.'s are operated by profit-making companies like Aetna, Cigna and Pacificare, but Ms. Ignagni rarely talks about their profits or losses. She prefers to talk about the quality of health care, the concerns of consumers, the work that H.M.O.'s are doing to detect breast cancer and treat asthma.
As consumer groups, labor unions and doctors press Congress for legislation to define patients' rights, the position of the managed-care industry has been continually evolving.
Two years ago Ms. Ignagni said her members saw no need for legislation. Now, she said, they strenuously oppose the main Democratic bill and have not endorsed the Republican bill, although they see it as "less undesirable."
Explaining why she was now willing to consider legislation, Ms. Ignagni said, "If we want to influence the discussion in Congress, we can't oppose everything."
Provisions of the Republican bill allowing patients to appeal the denial of care are "a good starting point for bipartisan discussion," she said. But, she added, "We dislike provisions of the Republican bill that micromanage our activities and dictate the design of health plans."
Ms. Ignagni's presence is a reminder of the history of H.M.O.'s. They have their roots in labor union health plans and in the idealism of the health cooperatives that were formed in the 1940's and 50's to obtain better health care at the lowest possible cost.
For years, the United Automobile Workers, the United Mine Workers and other labor unions had seats on the board of the Group Health Association of America, established in 1959. In 1996, the organization changed its name to the American Association of Health Plans.
Ms. Ignagni has combined policy and politics throughout her career. After graduating from Providence College in Rhode Island in 1975, she worked as a research analyst at the Social Security Administration, analyzing data on health spending.
She moved to the Committee for National Health Insurance, formed by Walter Reuther of the auto workers' union, and then worked for Senate Democrats before taking a job at the A.F.L.-C.I.O., where she held senior staff positions from 1982 to 1993.
Ms. Ignagni did not seek her current job; she was recruited by an executive search firm. She received a salary of $300,000 last year, plus a $100,000 bonus for her performance.
When the House passed a Republican bill to regulate H.M.O.'s last summer, Ms. Ignagni complained that "the debate has been defined by politicians, pollsters and Hollywood producers." But she herself has used the techniques of a political campaign in trying to fend off Government regulation of managed care.
For example, the association says it has developed a database with the names of millions of patients, H.M.O. employees and allies who can be dispatched at a moment's notice to answer critics of managed care. The group boasts that it "helped generate thousands of letters to the editor" last year.
"We've made a real effort to take our message, our campaign, to voters, physicians, Medicare beneficiaries and opinion leaders around the country," Ms. Ignagni said.
The association is running advertisements in Iowa and New Hampshire to persuade Presidential candidates that they cannot win many votes by "bashing H.M.O.'s."
Ms. Ignagni hired an economic consulting firm, the Barents Group, a unit of KPMG, to estimate the local costs of Federal mandates, and she has publicized the results in news conferences around the country.
Even as Federal auditors contend that H.M.O.'s are overpaid by the Medicare program, Ms. Ignagni is asking Congress to increase those payments. She commissioned a study by the accounting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers to support her case. And she has recruited elderly people as lobbyists, urging Congress to increase reimbursement so health plans will not drop out of Medicare.
In all of this, Ms. Ignagni seems untroubled by the apparent contradictions between her old and new roles. "I've never had a sense that I was advocating something I didn't believe in," she said.

HEADLINE: Paper Trail Haunts G.M. After It Loses Injury Suit

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, July 11

 BODY:
The $4.9 billion verdict in a personal-injury lawsuit against General Motors on Friday might be only the start of the company's problems. Lawyers and safety consultants pursuing similar cases say corporate documents used as evidence in the case, many for the first time, could be troublesome for General Motors in the future.
The jury here awarded the record-setting damages to six people who were badly burned when the gas tank of their 1979 Chevrolet Malibu exploded after the car was rammed from behind by another vehicle. The plaintiffs have pledged to donate half of any punitive damages they collect after taxes to the state of California to pay for the care and treatment of burn victims, their lawyer, Brian J. Panish, said today. 
 Central to the case was a 1973 "value analysis" written by an Edward C. Ivey, an Oldsmobile engineer still employed by G.M., who calculated that fuel-tank fires after accidents were costing the company $2.40 per vehicle. Plaintiffs in the Los Angeles case had argued that General Motors did not design cars more safely because it would have cost the company more than it was losing in settlements with accident victims.
"The Ivey memo is an economic blueprint for lawyers," said Clarence M. Ditlow, executive director of the Center for Auto Safety in Washington, a group co-founded by Ralph Nader that is involved in similar cases. "It set a cost constraint on how much G.M. was willing to put into hardware to prevent a fire that was otherwise preventable."
General Motors argued that its vehicles were safe and that the Ivey memo was the work of a junior engineer and was never used in design.
"There was no evidence that any engineer who worked on this vehicle or any other vehicle at General Motors used the information in the Ivey document or used that approach in making decisions on design," said Richard W. Shapiro, a Phoenix lawyer who represented General Motors in the case decided on Friday.
Still, the company has long worried about the document and how it might be perceived. "Obviously, Ivey is not an individual whom we would ever, in any conceivable situation, want to be identified to the plaintiffs," in a lawsuit, a lawyer hired by General Motors wrote after interviewing Mr. Ivey in 1981. "The documents he generated are undoubtedly some of the potentially most harmful and most damaging were they ever to be produced."
General Motors has mainly succeeded in keeping the Ivey memo from being introduced as evidence since it first became known to plaintiff's lawyers in the early 1980's. Last year a judge in Florida threatened General Motors with "very severe sanctions" if it did not provide the memo and related documents. Some of that evidence was in turn used in the Los Angeles case.
The "cumulative effect" of documents released in successive trials allows plaintiffs to "lose less and win more," said Sheldon J. Schlesinger, a Fort Lauderdale lawyer who represented the plaintiffs in the Florida case.
In that case, a jury ordered General Motors to pay $60 million to the family of a boy killed in a fuel-tank fire after a trailer struck the 1983 Oldsmobile Cutlass station wagon in which he was riding. The award was later reduced to $33 million.
In the Los Angeles case, the jury in Superior Court of Los Angeles County awarded Patricia Anderson, her four children and a family friend, Jo Tigner, $107.6 million in compensatory damages and $4.8 billion in punitive damages after their Malibu, stopping for a red light, was rammed by a drunken driver on Christmas Eve 1993.
The award is the largest ever in a personal-injury lawsuit, said Thomas F. Harrison, publisher of Lawyers Weekly USA, a newspaper published in Boston that tracks such awards. He said the previous largest was $1.24 billion awarded in January by a jury in Wisconsin to the estate of a woman who had died from a fuel-related fire after a go-cart accident at a Florida amusement park.
General Motors said it was confident that Friday's decision would be overturned on appeal, and legal experts said it was highly likely that the award would, at the least, be significantly reduced.
Mr. Shapiro, the lawyer for General Motors, said the Los Angeles case might not have that much influence on other cases because other judges could have different views on what evidence is admissible. He contended that the Los Angeles judge, Ernest G. Williams, did not allow the company to present evidence showing that cars with the same body as the 1979 Malibu had explosions only once in every 23.5 billion miles.
Mr. Panish, the main lawyer for the plaintiffs in Los Angeles, said there were dozens of other cases involving General Motors cars with designs similar to the 1979 Malibu's, with the fuel tank close to the rear bumper, an estimate General Motors called exceedingly high. The company said that the Los Angeles and Florida cases were the only ones it had lost involving such cars and that the Florida plaintiffs were not awarded punitive damages.
Terry Rhadigan, a company spokesman, said the fuel tank had been moved forward around 1984. He said that the placement of the fuel tank behind the rear axle had been common in the industry before that time and that the change was made for overall design reasons, not because the design had been unsafe.
There are about 50 cases pending against the company resulting from fires in pre-1988 G.M. pickup trucks in which the fuel tanks were mounted outside the frame on the side of the vehicles, said Mr. Ditlow of the Center for Auto Safety.
News of the huge Los Angeles verdict could prompt more people to sue for older accidents. One is Linda McOscar, who said she and her three children were sitting in a 1980 Malibu beside a highway in South Texas in June 1980, when their car was rammed from behind by a truck driven by a drunken driver. The Malibu spun around and caught fire. Mrs. McOscar managed to crawl through a window, pulling her 10-year-old son, Spencer, who was in the front passenger seat, out with her. But 13-year-old Joey and 13-month-old Hillary, who were in the back seat, were killed.
Mrs. McOscar, of Monroe, Mich., said that when she heard about the Los Angeles verdict on the news, "It just blew my mind."
"I kept waking up in the night thinking in 1973 they knew there was a defect," she said. Although she and her husband received about $55,000 from General Motors in a settlement, they say they are thinking about suing based on the new evidence.
General Motors in the early 1980's hired six law firms to scour its records to find documents that could be damaging in such cases. These lawyers have been nicknamed the "fire babies" by plaintiffs' lawyers.
One such document is the Ivey memo, only one and a half pages long. It estimated how many fatalities there were from post-accident fuel-related fires and assumed a value of $200,000 per fatality. By dividing by the number of G.M. cars on the road, Mr. Ivey came up with an estimate of the cost to G.M. of $2.40 per vehicle. But Mr. Ivey also cautioned that "it is really impossible to put a value on human life" and that "a human fatality is beyond value, subjectively."
The memo does not say why the analysis was done. In depositions in this and previous cases, Mr. Ivey said that he could not remember anyone asking him to do the study and did not believe it was distributed.
But the lawyer's interview with Mr. Ivey in 1981 seems to contradict that position. According to the report by the lawyer, who worked for an outside firm hired by G.M., Mr. Ivey did not specifically recall being asked to do the analysis but said he thought he had been asked by a superior to help in "trying to figure out how much Olds could spend on fuel systems." Mr. Ivey said it was probably distributed to several people, though he did not know if it had ever been used.
Some other G.M. memos presented at the trial also showed that cost-benefit analysis was used on safety questions. In a 1974 memo, a G.M. official named R. G. Fischer performed a calculation similar to Mr. Ivey's and concluded that G.M. could spend $2 a car "effectively for rear impact protection." A Jan. 1, 1973, memo said that "cost/safety benefit is to be evaluated before releasing components" for performance that exceeds Federal requirements for fuel system integrity.
"This was literally an 18-year cover-up, and the jurors were outraged," said Mark Robinson Jr., one of the lawyers for the plaintiffs, who said the Los Angeles case was stronger than one two decades ago in which he won a big award for fuel-tank fire in a Ford Pinto -- $128 million in punitive and compensatory damages, which was later reduced to $7 million.
Coleman Thorton, the foreman of the Los Angeles jury, said in an interview that the Ivey memo had been just one factor in the verdict. More important, he said, was that Mr. Ivey, who testified through a videotaped deposition, and other General Motors officials appeared to be evasive.
"People who were well-qualified are not supposed to have instant amnesia," Mr. Thorton, a retired custodian, said. "That is the way that most of the witnesses for the defendant reacted."

HEADLINE: The Trillion-Dollar Problem

 BODY:
Only a few years ago, the idea of Congress and the President wrangling over a trillion-dollar budget surplus would have provoked disbelief. But it turns out that the new era of surpluses is just as contentious as the old era of deficits. As Congress returns to work today, House Republicans are preparing a tax cut so large it would use up virtually all of the surplus for 10 years, leaving no money to make Medicare solvent or to avoid deeper domestic cuts. The likelihood that President Clinton would veto an outsized tax cut is only spurring them on. Lawmakers seem to favor slogans over solutions.
But there is no reason to rule out progress this year on critical issues, including the urgent problem of insuring that the baby-boom generation has adequate health care in its retirement years. A little clear thinking will help everyone establish priorities at a time when there is enough money to address them. Some gains have already been achieved. The Congressional Budget Office projects a surplus of nearly $2.9 trillion in the next 10 years, and Democrats and Republicans agree in principle that the $1.9 trillion generated by Social Security taxes should go back into that system to keep it solvent well into the next century. The fight is over the remaining $1 trillion. 
 If Americans want to use that money for tax cuts, they need to know the consequences. The surplus rests on the assumption that Congress and the White House will carry out previously targeted spending cuts. No one thinks that will happen. The budget ceilings for this year, enacted in 1997, call for cuts that the Republican chairmen of the various appropriations committees already say are unrealistic. But the same 1997 law requires even more cuts in future years. At a time when Gov. George W. Bush is getting much applause for his brand of "compassionate conservatism," Republicans in Congress should think twice about more cuts in health, job training, environmental programs and research in science and medicine.
A more realistic approach would set aside a substantial part of the surplus to sustain current domestic spending and perhaps expand it in certain areas. President Clinton also wants to set aside another chunk for Medicare, where Republicans might have some incentive to agree. After the 1995 budget shutdowns, they should realize that the public punishes them every time they try to pay for tax cuts by trimming Medicare. It may be unrealistic to expect agreement on a specific plan to revamp Medicare, although Mr. Clinton's proposal to pay for prescription drugs has found some Republican support. But it is not unrealistic to set aside money for the job out of the surplus.
The reason for sequestering the money now is simple. If Republicans persist in cutting taxes deeply, the long-term consequences will be severe. It took 15 years of tax increases and budget cuts to overcome the deficits created by President Ronald Reagan's tax reductions in 1981. It makes no sense to repeat that pattern. As for the 10-year, $864 billion tax-cut scheme that Bill Archer, chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, plans to push, one wonders what the rationale could be. With the Federal Reserve Board raising interest rates for fear of an overheated economy, no stimulus is needed. It is perverse to cut taxes for those who have benefited most from the current boom.
Any scenario for constructive engagement on the budget must start with negotiations in the weeks ahead. The best chance for success would come if Republicans came to their budget senses early and designed a more realistic scheme for the next 10 years. A signal from Mr. Bush, the party's new favorite son, might help. A trillion-dollar budget agreement would be better for everyone than a trillion-dollar breakdown.

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER and MARK LANDLER

 BODY:
Just two years after it began, the financial crisis that started in Asia and spread pain around the world appears to be over -- leaving many to wonder if the symptoms have abated before the disease could be treated.
All the conventional measures of health look good. Stock markets that tumbled soon after the crisis started in Thailand in July 1997 have bounced back, ranking among the world's best performers in the first half of 1999. Currencies that plummeted, leaving ruin in their wake, have crawled back. Foreign investors who fled Asia like moviegoers from a burning theater are returning, poking around for hidden bargains amid the embers. 
 President Clinton's plausible assessment nine months ago that the world faced "the worst financial crisis in half a century" now seems to many market watchers like a distant echo from another financial era.
But the recovery may have come too fast. In interviews with business executives, policymakers and investors in Asia and America, there is one common thread: The remarkable speed of the rebound has drained the political urgency out of many reforms that seemed so vital during the darkest days of the crisis -- and may still be essential to Asia's future.
Moreover, the pain that is invisible on traders' screens, but striking in the villages where unemployment and misery still lurk, will not ease any time soon.
Most Asian countries have not genuinely confronted the twin weaknesses of their economies: insolvent banks and deeply indebted corporations. Bad loans and bad habits still plague financial institutions from Korea to Indonesia.
"You hear a lot about reforms since the Asian crisis," James A. Harmon, chairman of the Export-Import Bank of the United States, said in an interview. "The truth is that many of the reforms are not proceeding. Old habits die hard."
Mr. Harmon speaks from bitter experience: Not long ago he quietly sought help from Indonesia's President, B. J. Habibie, in convincing one of the country's biggest conglomerates, the Bakrie Group, to begin repaying $80 million owed to the Ex-Im Bank, an American Government agency that lends money abroad to buyers of American-made goods. Mr. Harmon's message was clear: The United States stood behind the bailout that kept Indonesia from a wholesale financial meltdown, and its taxpayers should not be stiffed.
So far, Mr. Harmon has proved singularly unpersuasive, perhaps because the man who owes him, Aburizal Bakrie, has also emerged as one of Mr. Habibie's staunchest supporters. Mr. Bakrie did not respond to several requests for an interview.
In the place where the crisis began, Thailand, the man responsible for overhauling the battered financial system, Amaret Sila-on, rarely misses an opportunity to warn that less has changed than meets the eye.
Yes, he says, Thailand has finally created a bankruptcy court, after two years of foot-dragging by politicians who also head some of the country's biggest insolvent companies. But cronyism lives, he warns, as does the system that heedlessly lent money to the politically powerful. "If the rule of law still remains weaker than the rule of men," Mr. Amaret argues, "banks will return to their old ways despite the restructuring efforts."
The guiding ethic around Asia these days seems to be this: "Wait it out, because in a rebounding market, we will not have to change much." Foreign money is returning, in some cases fueled by Western companies seeking bargains, in other cases by mutual fund managers riding the momentum of a perceived recovery. Some funds may also belong to wealthy ethnic Chinese and others in Southeast Asia who sent cash abroad during the crisis, and now are gradually bringing it back home.
"A lot of C.E.O.'s are clinging to their jobs," said Razak Baginda, who directs the Malaysian Strategic Research Center, a research firm in Kuala Lumpur. "In a way, they've been saved by the stock market."
 
Corruption, Collusion And Complacency
While some of Asia's most troubled companies had to liquidate or sell out to Western investors, many firms that appear insolvent have remained frozen in place. The result is that the corruption and collusion that contributed to the crisis and the complacency that allowed banks to lend with abandon as governments looked the other way have not disappeared.
"There is no question that with improving markets, political pressure to change things is reduced," Stanley Fischer, the No. 2 official at the International Monetary Fund, said recently. Mr. Fischer argues that risks of a "systemic crisis" have been reduced, partly because of changes in his own institution.
James D. Wolfensohn, the president of the World Bank, which often openly disagrees with the I.M.F.'s prescriptions, calls the end of the crisis "a very mixed story," and worries that institutions like his own "no longer have the leverage to get the system fixed" now that the countries do not need immediate cash.
One reason the reforms have been so plodding is that no one ever really decided what caused the crisis. Americans were quick to point to traditions of cronyism and corruption. But those practices have characterized business in Asia for decades, and did not slow what was known as the East Asian miracle.
Asians, bolstered by some big-name Western economists, blamed the I.M.F. for worsening the crisis by forcing big spending cuts to trim deficits. The I.M.F. reversed its strategy after some months. In the end, American and I.M.F. officials note, the countries that most closely followed its advice -- Thailand, South Korea and Brazil -- appear to have rebounded the fastest. The two nations that were so mired in political chaos that they never executed the I.M.F.'s plans -- Russia and Indonesia -- are still in deep trouble.
Pressure from Washington has been uneven. For much of last year, the Asian crisis dominated White House strategy sessions, with many senior officials fearing it could puncture Wall Street's party. But the sense of crisis abated last September after Russia's economic collapse was contained more quickly than anyone expected. And gradually the impetus for wide-ranging reforms slackened, and grand plans for remaking the world financial system became modest adjustments, including new I.M.F. mechanisms to respond earlier to "economic contagion" hitting otherwise well-run countries.
Some problems that contributed to the crisis seem to have been at least temporarily addressed. Virtually all the crisis-hit countries frittered away state foreign currency reserves trying to keep their currencies strong -- and tried to hide that news from investors. Now that the I.M.F. has pressed countries to publish more information, data once considered state secrets can now be found on the Fund's Internet site (www.imf.org).
The Thai baht and the Korean won float freely, and the countries have rebuilt their war-chests of foreign currency mostly by exporting to the United States, and stacking up the dollars they get in return.
Moreover, Asian countries have largely halted their practice of borrowing on short terms from abroad to finance big, long-term projects. That proved disastrous when projects ground to a halt and currencies fell, forcing companies and banks to repay huge debts immediately.
Other bad habits are proving harder to break. No Asian country has yet put an effective bankruptcy law on its books, meaning it is still impossible to wipe out insolvent businesses, settle with creditors, and rebuild viable companies. Thailand has come closest -- opening its first bankruptcy court last month and staffing it with 60 judges.
Still, skeptics say it will take months for those judges to master complex bankruptcy law. And they will find it hard to fight proprietors of debt-ridden companies, some of whom sit in the Thai Senate and have bitterly opposed the passage of stronger laws.
 
Companies Tell Debtors: 'Go Fly a Kite'
In Indonesia, where the laws are even more toothless, the Government has resorted to shaming its corporate sector. The Indonesian Bank Restructuring Authority recently named the 100 worst debtors in local newspapers. But even conglomerates on the list, like the Bakrie Group, are dragging their feet on resolving their debt problems.
Bakrie has offered to give its banks equity in return for canceling its $1 billion in debt. The Export-Import Bank and other creditors object that the plan would leave the Bakrie family, which dug the conglomerate into a hole in the first place, with considerable influence. And they believe Mr. Bakrie has wildly overstated the value of that equity. Still, some local bankers say Bakrie's creditors may have little choice but to go along.
"When companies tell their creditors to go through regular legal channels, that basically means, 'Go fly a kite,' " said a senior official at an American bank in Jakarta, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
Rizal Ramli, an Indonesian economist, said the Government lacked the courage to go after well-connected tycoons. "During the Suharto era," he said, "there were only five conglomerates that were untouchable because of their ties to Suharto. Now, there seem to be many more."
As long as Asia's banks cannot pursue debtors, they cannot clean up their balance sheets. Nearly half of all loans carried on the books of Thai banks are classified as nonperforming -- meaning they will probably never be repaid. As a result, Thailand's banks have not made fresh loans, hampering economic recovery, even with a resurgent currency and stock market. The same is true in Indonesia, Malaysia, and Korea -- and of course in Japan, whose banking problems continue to affect the rest of Asia.
Hopes that the crisis would bring accountability to Asian business are fading fast, too. In Malaysia, the infrastructure giant Renong ran up $2.4 billion in debts, despite winning lucrative franchises to run toll roads and bridges. Renong's creditors blamed the youthful chairman, Halim Saad.
Renong is now being rescued by a $2.2 billion bond offering by one of its subsidiaries, which operates Malaysia's key north-south toll highway. Although the bonds are not guaranteed by the Government -- which would make it a direct bailout -- analysts say it will result in higher tolls or force the Government to extend the company's franchise. Mr. Halim, a protege of Finance Minister Daim Zainuddin and a favorite of Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, has meanwhile kept his job.
 
Risks of Backsliding In a Very Clubby World
Nowhere, perhaps, is the danger of Asia backsliding more apparent than in the case of Philippine Airlines. The flagship carrier of the Philippines has been staggering under $2.2 billion in debt -- the victim of costly fleet expansion at the time of the regional crisis.
Philippine Airlines, commonly known as PAL, is controlled by Lucio C. Tan, one of the country's leading tycoons and a loyal supporter of the Philippine President, Joseph P. Estrada, who used a PAL plane for free during last year's presidential campaign.
The Government has so far refused to bail out the airline, but Mr. Estrada has made it a personal mission to keep Philippine Airlines flying. He has backed a rehabilitation plan that would leave Mr. Tan, a tobacco-and-beer mogul, in control. The Ex-Im Bank, which financed PAL's purchase of Boeing planes, opposes the plan -- and seized a PAL Boeing 747 this year when it flew into the United States.
A court forced the bank to return the plane, but now it has threatened to seize four Boeing 747's, saying it fears PAL is not maintaining them well enough to preserve their value as collateral. Mr. Tan has not responded to interview requests.
Philippine Airlines proposes to recover -- by getting the Government to reduce the number of rival carriers allowed to fly into the Philippines. That would run counter to the movement to open Asia's markets. "This would be a disaster, not just for the tourist industry but for the country in general," said Emmanuel Gonzalez, the president of the Hotel, Resort and Restaurant Association of Cebu, a resort island.
As the Asian crisis recedes, Mr. Gonzalez is finally seeing his business improve. But the Philippine Airlines case reminds him how little has changed in the clubby world of Asian commerce. "When people here say, 'Wouldn't it be awful if we lost our flag carrier?' " he said, "I wonder if they're really saying, 'Wouldn't it be awful if we didn't get our free tickets anymore?' "

SOUTH KOREA
A surging stock market has lifted domestic demand, and exports are strong. But the Government has yet to tackle its powerful, debt-plagued conglomerates, known as chaebol, and momentum toward opening markets are losing steam.
 
THAILAND
Thailand finally passed a bankruptcy law. Banks have been able to raise fresh capital, but they have made little progress whittling down bad loans. The stock market recovery has outpaced that of the economy as a whole.
 
INDONESIA
Free elections and a measure of stability are the biggest changes. While the economic contraction is not as crippling as feared, there has been little progress in over-hauling a shattered banking system. Tycoons still demand -- and get -- preferential treatment.
 
MALAYSIA
Malaysia stymied those who predicted that its capital and currency controls would choke the economy. The currency is stable, and foreign reserves are up. But the restructuring of companies has been glacial.
 
RUSSIA
Nearly a year after the ruble's collapse, the country's economy is slowly sinking, but Russians simply endure it. Political chaos has made any real reforms impossible. The I.M.F. is about to lend Russia enough money to keep the country from default.
 
BRAZIL
Perhaps the clearest case of an American-backed I.M.F. bailout doing the job. The economy has bounced back from its troubles last winter far faster than anyone expected. But the rest of Latin America remains mired in recession.

HEADLINE: From High to Low, Hopefuls for 2000 Are Awash in Funds

BYLINE: By ADAM CLYMER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 11

 BODY:
Representative Shelley Berkley, a freshman Democrat from Nevada, has raised nearly half a million dollars in 10 weeks. Mayoral candidates who are not even favorites are also filling their war chests. And the Democratic National Committee is out of debt.
At all levels, the political system is awash in money. Gov. George W. Bush of Texas may have the most startling bankroll, $36.3 million, but he is part of a phenomenon and not the phenomenon itself. 
 As candidates for Federal office and the national party committees prepare to file their midyear fund-raising reports with the Federal Election Commission, it is becoming clear that money for the 2000 elections is rushing in faster than ever. The strong economy has made it easier to get contributions, and candidates are mobilizing their fund-raising efforts earlier than in previous election cycles.
Fund-raising has become the chief barometer of early political strength, so candidates have been working feverishly to fortify their war chests. And lack of money can be a sign of terminal weakness.
For example, one major factor when Dennis Moore ran in 1998 for a Kansas Congressional seat where no Democrat had won in 40 years was that Representative Vince Snowbarger's June 30, 1997, campaign finance report showed he had only $9,567 in cash on hand. Mr. Moore took the seat back for the Democrats with a narrow victory.
In the six months since he was sworn in, Mr. Moore has worked the phones almost every day to make sure no one sees him as financially vulnerable this year. "I like to learn from other people's mistakes, not my own," he said. Next week his campaign will report about $310,000 cash on hand, a startling total for a freshman.
Representative James E. Rogan, Republican of California, read that President Clinton and various Hollywood figures had targeted him for defeat after his role as an impeachment manager. But other people read that too, and 1,000 of them sent him campaign contributions. So he started a direct mail campaign that has succeeded beyond all expectations, and he will report more than $750,000 in the bank next week.
Governor Bush's $36.3 million Presidential take is spectacular, but others are raking it in, too. Bill Bradley, basically running as "not Al Gore," took in $11.5 million. The National Republican Congressional Committee reports a record haul. The Democratic National Committee is, of all things, out of debt for the first time since September 1996.
Political consultants of both parties report that money is easier to raise than they can remember.
"I've even seen it in a few mayoral campaigns this year," said David Dixon, a Democratic operative here. "Even the sort of midlevel candidates are raising more money than ever before."
Consultants and political strategists start with a predictable set of explanations, largely independent of party.
First of all, they say, their candidate or party has really caught the national mood and people want to help. Secondarily, their staffs have done a terrific job.
And finally, they add, in the words of Shelly Kamins, a developer from Potomac, Md., who runs Bush events here: "Certainly one of the factors is the prosperity in the country. You've got a lot more people who are able to give a thousand dollars."
Mr. Dixon said local contributions were increasing, as new businesses were turning good profits.
"Fifteen years ago you asked them to work phone banks," he said of these donors. "Now you ask them to contribute."
Actually, donors sometimes do not have to be asked. Ronald Weiser, Mr. Bush's chairman in Michigan, said he found the enthusiasm for his candidate "absolutely amazing." In past campaigns, he said, it was hard work to find supporters, especially people who would take on fund-raising.
"This year they are coming to us, asking if they can raise money for Bush," he said. "We say yes, they can."
For most candidates for Congress, an intense battleground because a six-seat shift would give Democrats control, the calls have to be made. Steve Gray-Barkan, a California consultant working for Adam Schiff, Mr. Rogan's likely opponent, hails his client as "a fanatical phoner." Representative Berkley of Nevada, who has raised $485,000 this year, almost all of it since she returned from a honeymoon in April, said, "I'm relentless on the telephone."
"After you've been turned down 10 times," she said, "picking up the phone and making the 11th call, that's the secret."
Mr. Moore said: "I hate to make these calls, but it's a fact of life. You've got to do it if you want to stay in Congress."
Rachel Gorlin, a Democratic consultant, said those calls may be easier to make than they used to be, when "candidates just dreaded picking up the phone and calling people, likely as not to hear complaints." Now, she said, the reception is likely to be civil and to lead to a contribution.
Where is this leading? Norman J. Ornstein, a Congressional scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, an economic and political research foundation here, sees one likely impact of all the money that seems to be available. In the race for the House, he said, there will probably be only 25 or 30 districts that seem competitive by the fall of 2000, "races where both sides spend $2 million and where you get outside groups spending a few million more."
As a result of a 1996 Supreme Court decision, those "outside groups" will include, in a big way, the national party committees. Some of them will not file reports until July 20, but what their spokesmen say indicates they are all sharing in the wealth.
Even the Republican Senate Campaign Committee, whose reports through May show lower receipts than two years ago, is comfortably in the black, and will be more so in a couple of weeks when it receives its half of a record-breaking $9 million joint House-Senate dinner.
At the Republican National Committee, prospecting for new donors, while expensive, has turned up 51,000 fresh checkbooks, "a huge number of people to join a party in an off-year," said Mike Collins, the press secretary. The National Republican Congressional Committee will report a record-breaking $26 million take, and, more to the point, its cash on hand is at $9.3 million, compared with $5.7 million two years ago and $4.5 million four years ago.
Among the Democratic committees, the House campaign committee expects to report more than $14 million raised, or more than twice as much as it took in two years ago. The Senate campaign committee will report $3.9 million in cash on hand, eight times as much as two years ago. Jim Jordan, the committee's political director under Senator Bob Torricelli of New Jersey, the chairman, called the haul a tribute "as much to hard work and a talented staff and a determined chairman as to economic conditions or macro political issues."
And the Democratic National Committee expects to report $21 million in fund-raising and a surplus of $500,000 to $700,000. The chairman, Joe Andrew, said the high numbers were attributable largely to "the Clinton-Gore economy, the best in a generation."
Fred Wertheimer, an architect of the 1974 Federal Election Campaign Act who now leads an advocacy organization called Democracy 21, sees prosperity as only one factor in the torrent of money available.
"All the brakes are off the system," Mr. Wertheimer said. When Mr. Bush's "Pioneers," his club of leading fund-raisers, "are raising $100,000 at $1,000 a contribution," Mr. Wertheimer said, "they will be raising a million or more each when they start collecting soft money."
"We're in a different stratosphere here," he said.
Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, head of the Republican Senate Campaign Committee and his party's chief opponent of change in the campaign finance laws, disagreed. "For most Americans if they are interested in politics at all," he said, "the way they express that is they write out a check for their favorite candidate or cause."
The big ideological causes whose backers send money are likely to be the usual ones: guns, abortion and gay rights. But there is one new one, impeachment. There is even an Impeachment Managers Political Action Committee, which hopes to raise $130,000 through an Internet site that has brought in some money already without an official start-up. The modest financial goal would be enough to give each of the 13 impeachment managers $5,000 for a primary and $5,000 for the general election.
But even if ideology directs some of the dollars, it is the economy that is providing them.
"Everybody is pouring money in," said Tom Downey, a lobbyist here who raises money for various Democrats. "They are rich and the economy's strong. At every level there is more money."
Warren Tompkins, a Republican consultant in Columbia, S.C., said, "People are making more money and they are willing to let go of a little of it."

HEADLINE: What James Farmer Leaves Behind

 BODY:
James Farmer, the former head of the Congress of Racial Equality, who died on Friday at 79, was the last of the major civil rights leaders of his generation, and one of the first to begin the struggle. Moved by what he had learned in college of Gandhi's use of nonviolent disobedience, Mr. Farmer founded CORE as a local group in Chicago in the early 1940's, and it was there that he first used Gandhian tactics to integrate the White City Roller Skating Rink. It worked in Chicago, and chapters sprang up east and west, in New York, Philadelphia, Los Angeles and Seattle. But it was unthinkable to try to take the effort into the deep South in the 1940's.
It was not until the late 1950's and early 60's that black and white civil rights activists began to defy the laws and customs of segregation in places like Alabama and Mississippi. To endure the consequent broken skulls and jaws and legs, to suffer shootings, burnings, bombings and lynchings, all without violent resistance, so that the nation could learn from the example of what was done, required a depth of courage and dignity and faith that has never been surpassed in the history of this nation. 
 Mr. Farmer was one of the principal leaders of that time. He directed the daring Freedom Rides that began integrating interstate bus service in the South in 1961. "My father was a Freedom Rider, I'm a Freedom Rider's son," he would sing out in jail. "He was one of the founding fathers not just of the New South, but of the New America," said Representative John Lewis, who was beaten unconscious and jailed with Mr. Farmer on one of the bus rides.
Mr. Farmer and CORE also formed an important bridge between the more traditional, legalistic organizations, like A. Philip Randolph's Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters, Roy Wilkins's National Association for the Advancement of Colored People and Whitney Young's Urban League, and the newer groups that grew in street power as the 1960's progressed. Among these were the Southern Christian Leadership Conference of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee led by Mr. Lewis, Julian Bond, James Foreman and others.
Together, James Farmer and the others led the effort to overcome a system of legal oppression that had endured, in one form or another, from the beginning of the nation. That is achievement enough for their generation. The effort to win greater fairness, and economic opportunity, remains for ours.

HEADLINE: Preventing the Next Power Failure

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Two July 9 front-page articles on recent power failures highlight the need for stand-alone energy sources. As demands of an affluent, wired society outstrip capacity, "off-grid" energy sources become essential, just as they are for poor countries with inadequate systems and supplies. 
 As energy demands grow and oil prices rise, surely it is time for a national debate on energy policies. Several principles may help: Low energy architecture and co-generation can dramatically improve energy efficiency. Manufacturing stand-alone renewable energy sources, like fuel cells, solar and wind-driven units, can provide security for medical laboratories, pump and purify water in developing countries and catalyze economic growth while helping to stabilize the climate.

HEADLINE: FOES REPORT PLAN TO BEGIN PULLOUT IN KASHMIR REGION

BYLINE: By BARRY BEARAK 

DATELINE: ISLAMABAD, Pakistan, July 11

 BODY:
India and Pakistan said today that guerrilla infiltrators battling Indian troops in the last two months along the icy ridges and mountaintops of Kashmir would begin a phased withdrawal, heralding an end to the latest confrontation between the world's newest nuclear powers.
India and Pakistan, who have fought two wars over Kashmir since winning independence from Britain in 1947, were very cautious with their statements today, carefully portraying any silencing of the guns in terms of victory for their side. 
 The recent conflict has been depicted so differently in each country that the citizens of one would barely recognize the war that their counterparts have been following in the news.
While the Pakistanis were describing the development as a gradual cease-fire between warring parties, the Indians explained things more as the recognition of a fait accompli: Most of the invaders into its territory, the state of Kashmir, had already been killed or thrown out.
Either way, if the calm in the mountains holds -- and the step-by-step process is continued -- it would bring to an end the most serious tension between India and Pakistan in 30 years and the first major confrontation since the nations tested nuclear weapons in May 1998.
In a hastily called news conference tonight, Pakistan's Foreign Minister, Sartaj Aziz, said that a "disengagement" by Muslim militants was under way from the fierce fighting, some of it hand to hand, that has taken place in the strategic heights above a vital Indian supply route.
"The director generals of military operations of the two nations met today and agreed on the modalities of de-escalation, including sector-wise cessation of ground and air operations," Mr. Aziz said. "We have been informed that disengagement in the Kaksar sector, which began yesterday, has been proceeding satisfactorily. The disengagement for the Mushkoh sector will begin tonight. Gradually, the disengagement will be completed in the entire area."
The move toward peace was made exactly a week after Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif of Pakistan made a sudden trip to Washington and promised President Clinton that he would take "concrete steps" to end the crisis, seeking the withdrawal of guerrilla forces. He returned with a promise that the President would take a "personal interest" in solving the 52-year dispute over Kashmir.
Although statements from both sides in recent days had hinted at a shift away from diplomatic stalemate, neither India nor Pakistan gave any account of what exactly had led to today's meeting of their senior military chiefs, and the plans for phased withdrawal.
India's leaders have insisted the militant Muslim invaders in Kashmir were thick with Pakistani army regulars, and that the infiltration was a long-planned Pakistani military operation. For the Indians, then, what is taking place now is an anti-climactic withdrawal of defeated remnants.
They had already declared that 95 percent of the intruders had been driven out.
There is "some evidence of withdrawal," Brajesh Mishra, India's national security adviser, said today in New Delhi after a meeting of the leaders of political parties convened by Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee. "It is our hope that in seven days, the status quo of the L.O.C. will be restored if it goes according to plan," he said, referring to the 450-mile Line of Control that divides the Indian and Pakistani-controlled parts of Kashmir.
Since 1947, when India and Pakistan were carved from the British Empire, dominion over the storied Himalayan area of Kashmir has been in dispute, and was the direct cause for two of the three wars between the two nations.
Today, the Indian Maj. Gen. J. J. Singh said, "A decisive moment has now arrived for army operations to finish," adding stiffly that the military will not halt its offensive until every invader has been driven from the mountains.
The matter of whether retreating soldiers would be allowed "safe passage" has been a contentious issue in India since the tide began going its way on the battlefield.
Mr. Mishra was not so tough-talking. When asked if the Indian Army was slowing its attack, he said, "The Indian Army has no tradition of shooting at the backs of people."
In Islamabad, the attempt is to paint the latest turn as a diplomatic achievement for Mr. Sharif and a military victory for the Kashmiri mujahedeen, the Muslim guerrillas that the Government says have challenged the Indians with only moral support from Pakistan.
"In the past few weeks, the mujahedeen action has been gloriously successful as the just and legitimate cause of Kashmir has engaged the international community's undivided attention throughout the period," Mr. Aziz said. He said the focus must now "shift to the expeditious solution of the Kashmir dispute, so that one billion people who inhabit South Asia can lead a life of peace and engage in the endeavors for economic development and presperity."
Brig. Rashid Qureshi, Pakistani's top military spokesman, sat beside Mr. Aziz at the news conference and boasted repeatedly of how the mujahedeen had gotten the best of the Indian Army.
The Indians "have been talking about spectacular victories without having lost any casualties," he said. "That has been done to uplift their sagging morale because they have suffered tremendous casualties," he continued.
But such consistent praise for the mujahedeen's battlefield successes has created a problem for Mr. Sharif, whose trip to the United States is seen by many here as a "sell out" of the freedom fighters who, from most Pakistani accounts, have been heroically prevailing in a holy war.
In denying that any of the invaders are Pakistani soldiers -- something that many Western observers have openly called disingenuous -- the Prime Minister is now left to answer this troubling question: Who is it that is "disengaging" from the mountains, since the mujahedeen have in that last few days proclaimed they hold out till their last breath?
Such stirring defiance was reaffirmed earlier today by the United Jihad Council, an umbrella group of Kashmiri mujahedeen organizations. After Mr. Aziz's news conference, the council made no immediate comment.
Mr. Sharif is scheduled to address the nation Monday night, in which he is likely to reiterate earlier assertions that he in fact does have the mujahedeen's support for a strategic withdrawal -- and that he has convinced them that they have little more to gain from remaining in their bunkers in the mountains.
Brigadier Qureshi said tonight that he had no information about where the mujahedeen would now go, but he said he was sure they would be able to disperse without the Indians doing them harm and move on to continue their holy war elsewhere in Kashmir.
"One must understand that the mujahedeen are fully capable of taking care of themselves," he said.

HEADLINE: Better to Fix Up Cities Than Tear Them Down;
Unglamorous Tactic

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Re "Slash-and-Burn Urban Renewal" (Op-Ed, July 9):
Perhaps the most remarkable renewal program I've witnessed took place in Wyandotte, Mich., an otherwise sleepy suburb in the shadow of downtown Detroit. Several years ago city planners split Wyandotte into separate development and taxing districts.
Within each district, the city identified marginal neighborhoods that were in danger of sliding into decay.
The city used money raised in the tax-exempt bond market to carefully select and purchase one or two houses in each such neighborhood. By condemning, renovating and upgrading those houses at city expense, the city stabilized the neighborhood, induced residents to stay and improve their own homes, attracted new families and arrested the decay.
The appreciation in property values permitted the city to repay the bonds without a broad-based tax increase. The tactic was not glamorous. But as far as I could tell, it worked.

HEADLINE: MEDIA;
Big Turnout for Minority Journalists

BYLINE: By FELICITY BARRINGER

DATELINE: SEATTLE, July 10

 BODY:
If the gathering here this week had been a medical convention, it would have been billed as a gathering of experts seeking cures for terminal nearsightedness. More than 5,000 minority journalists -- and hundreds more people who train them, hire them, study their work, make their computers and advertise with their news organizations -- spent days debating what news organizations must do to put the world in focus.
The overarching assumption was that major news organizations will have continuing trouble keeping their audiences. "We need to paint a more complete picture of America," was the way that Catalina Camia, the president of Unity: Journalists of Color Inc., put it at the opening session of the group's second-ever national convention, which brought together members of the National Association of Black Journalists, the Asian-American Journalists' Association, the Native American Journalists Association and the National Association of Hispanic Journalists. 
 The event nearly foundered nine months ago when a faction of the black group said that Washington State was not a fit site because it had passed an anti-affirmative action initiative. But after rancorous debate, the groups voted to keep the gathering in Seattle. So for some, the existence of the convention was a victory. But for many, jobs mattered most.
"More people of color in the newsrooms -- that's the bottom-line goal of all of the four organizations," said Sheila Brooks, a member of the National Association of Black Journalists who is chief executive of SAB Productions , a television and video production company. "But it's not going to change unless we pound and pound and pound." The convention included a job fair at which scores of news organizations interviewed minority candidates.
"We've made at least one hire here -- at least," said Leonard Downie Jr., the executive editor of The Washington Post. Rob Dean, the managing editor of The New Mexican in Santa Fe, with a circulation of 25,000, had not filled the job opening he had, but said he talked to about 15 candidates and is taking six resumes home. Telly Hughes, a recent graduate of Illinois State University who, at 21, is looking for an entry-level job in broadcasting, came away with a fistful of business cards and a head filled with advice. "I can't believe these established people take time to talk to me," he said.
But hovering near the surface of this gathering was the knowledge that, five years after Unity had its first convention in Atlanta in 1995, the number of Hispanic, Native American, Asian and black newspaper journalists has risen to only 11.55 percent from 10.49 percent, for a total of 6,365 journalists out of 55,100 in newspaper newsrooms, according to an annual diversity survey of the American Society of Newspaper Editors.
But in local television stations, minorities in the work force dropped to 19 percent in 1998 from 21 percent in 1996, according to the Radio-Television News Directors Association.
The Census Bureau estimates that 28 percent of the country's population belongs to one of those four minority groups; that figure is expected to reach almost 38 percent by 2025.
Still, the stubbornness of the statistics and the sense at the convention that minority journalists are leaving the profession faster than they can be replaced did not dampen the spirits of some for whom the convention was like a family reunion. Organizers were pleased to see network correspondents and the publishers or editors of the country's five largest newspapers who came to recruit, and three Presidential candidates who addressed the group.
The jam-packed schedule featured multiple seminars by day -- sometimes six at a time -- and multiple parties by night -- at least six at a time. Sponsors included companies like Knight Ridder, Apple Computer Inc. and the Adolph Coors Company.
As the convention started, the Freedom Forum, a foundation based n Washington, released a survey showing that more than half of minority journalists plan to leave the business in the next five years even though 60 percent said that they liked their jobs "very much." Figures for nonminority journalists were unavailable.
The apparent paradox in the survey can perhaps be explained by ex-journalists like Mary Lou Fulton and Ron Funabiki. Ms. Fulton, whose mother is Mexican, describes her eight-year journalism career, mostly at The Los Angeles Times, in tones that mix real gratitude with deep dissatisfaction.
"Newspapers often believe that if you have enough different colored noses in a newsroom, that's going to make a better newspaper," said Ms. Fulton, who was by turns a local reporter and the editor of The Los Angeles Times's short-lived City Weekly. "I think having enough noses is essential, but you also have to have different coverage strategies." She praised the newspaper's new Hispanic desk, saying that earlier coverage of minority communities was one dimensional.
But for all that, she said, nothing could have kept her from the lure of the Internet, which she discovered five years ago after she had received a master's degree in public administration. Now 35, "an old woman" in her new world, she is leaving her job as a vice president for editorial operations of Yahoo's Geocities unit and is being interviewed for top jobs at two Internet start-ups, she said.
Mr. Funabiki, 50, who is Japanese-American, spent twice as much time in the business as Ms. Fulton, but reflected the same mix of satisfaction and frustration. At The San Diego Union, he had some choice assignments, including a self-designed beat covering the economics of the Pacific Rim. But Mr. Funabiki said he felt his career prospects were limited.
"I wasn't really angry or upset, but I wasn't satisfied with things, either," he said. In 1990, after 19 years in the business, he accepted an offer to start a new program at San Francisco State University focused on analyzing mainstream journalism. After five years, he moved to the Ford Foundation as a program officer.
Both Mr. Funabiki and Ms. Fulton came back to Unity this week -- Ms. Fulton as a panelist for a session on high-technology with Vice President Al Gore, and Mr. Funabiki to see how Unity used some of the $400,000 in grants Ford has made to it in recent years.
The reality of attrition, however, is making it hard to keep the minority numbers rising. A recent article in American Editor cited studies showing that journalism schools over all are producing about 750 minority print journalists a year -- exactly the number of people who, like Mr. Funabiki and Ms. Fulton, have been lost to attrition.

 CORRECTION:
An article in Business Day yesterday about Unity, the joint convention of minority journalists' organizations last week in Seattle, misstated the given name of a former San Diego reporter now at the Ford Foundation. He is Jon Funabiki, not Ron. The article also misstated the year of the group's first joint convention and misidentified a short-lived local section that formerly employed another minority journalist, at The Los Angeles Times. The meeting was in 1994, not 1995. The section was City Times, not City Weekly.

HEADLINE: Asian Rebound Derails Reform As Many Suffer

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER and MARK LANDLER

 BODY:
Just two years after it began, the financial crisis that started in Asia and spread pain around the world appears to be over -- leaving many to wonder if the symptoms have abated before the disease could be treated.
All the conventional measures of health look good. Stock markets that tumbled soon after the crisis started in Thailand in July 1997 have bounced back, ranking among the world's best performers in the first half of 1999. Currencies that plummeted, leaving ruin in their wake, have crawled back. Foreign investors who fled Asia like moviegoers from a burning theater are returning, poking around for hidden bargains amid the embers. 
 President Clinton's plausible assessment nine months ago that the world faced "the worst financial crisis in half a century" now seems to many market watchers like a distant echo from another financial era.
But the recovery may have come too fast. In interviews with business executives, policymakers and investors in Asia and America, there is one common thread: The remarkable speed of the rebound has drained the political urgency out of many reforms that seemed so vital during the darkest days of the crisis -- and may still be essential to Asia's future.
Moreover, the pain that is invisible on traders' screens, but striking in the villages where unemployment and misery still lurk, will not ease any time soon.
Most Asian countries have not genuinely confronted the twin weaknesses of their economies: insolvent banks and deeply indebted corporations. Bad loans and bad habits still plague financial institutions from Korea to Indonesia.
"You hear a lot about reforms since the Asian crisis," James A. Harmon, chairman of the Export-Import Bank of the United States, said in an interview. "The truth is that many of the reforms are not proceeding. Old habits die hard."
Mr. Harmon speaks from bitter experience: Not long ago he quietly sought help from Indonesia's President, B. J. Habibie, in convincing one of the country's biggest conglomerates, the Bakrie Group, to begin repaying $80 million owed to the Ex-Im Bank, an American Government agency that lends money abroad to buyers of American-made goods. Mr. Harmon's message was clear: The United States stood behind the bailout that kept Indonesia from a wholesale financial meltdown, and its taxpayers should not be stiffed.
So far, Mr. Harmon has proved singularly unpersuasive, perhaps because the man who owes him, Aburizal Bakrie, has also emerged as one of Mr. Habibie's staunchest supporters. Mr. Bakrie did not respond to several requests for an interview.
In the place where the crisis began, Thailand, the man responsible for overhauling the battered financial system, Amaret Sila-on, rarely misses an opportunity to warn that less has changed than meets the eye.
Yes, he says, Thailand has finally created a bankruptcy court, after two years of foot-dragging by politicians who also head some of the country's biggest insolvent companies. But cronyism lives, he warns, as does the system that heedlessly lent money to the politically powerful. "If the rule of law still remains weaker than the rule of men," Mr. Amaret argues, "banks will return to their old ways despite the restructuring efforts."
The guiding ethic around Asia these days seems to be this: "Wait it out, because in a rebounding market, we will not have to change much." Foreign money is returning, in some cases fueled by Western companies seeking bargains, in other cases by mutual fund managers riding the momentum of a perceived recovery. Some funds may also belong to wealthy ethnic Chinese and others in Southeast Asia who sent cash abroad during the crisis, and now are gradually bringing it back home.
"A lot of C.E.O.'s are clinging to their jobs," said Razak Baginda, who directs the Malaysian Strategic Research Center, a research firm in Kuala Lumpur. "In a way, they've been saved by the stock market."
 
Corruption, Collusion And Complacency
While some of Asia's most troubled companies had to liquidate or sell out to Western investors, many firms that appear insolvent have remained frozen in place. The result is that the corruption and collusion that contributed to the crisis and the complacency that allowed banks to lend with abandon as governments looked the other way have not disappeared.
"There is no question that with improving markets, political pressure to change things is reduced," Stanley Fischer, the No. 2 official at the International Monetary Fund, said recently. Mr. Fischer argues that risks of a "systemic crisis" have been reduced, partly because of changes in his own institution.
James D. Wolfensohn, the president of the World Bank, which often openly disagrees with the I.M.F.'s prescriptions, calls the end of the crisis "a very mixed story," and worries that institutions like his own "no longer have the leverage to get the system fixed" now that the countries do not need immediate cash.
One reason the reforms have been so plodding is that no one ever really decided what caused the crisis. Americans were quick to point to traditions of cronyism and corruption. But those practices have characterized business in Asia for decades, and did not slow what was known as the East Asian miracle.
Asians, bolstered by some big-name Western economists, blamed the I.M.F. for worsening the crisis by forcing big spending cuts to trim deficits. The I.M.F. reversed its strategy after some months. In the end, American and I.M.F. officials note, the countries that most closely followed its advice -- Thailand, South Korea and Brazil -- appear to have rebounded the fastest. The two nations that were so mired in political chaos that they never executed the I.M.F.'s plans -- Russia and Indonesia -- are still in deep trouble.
Pressure from Washington has been uneven. For much of last year, the Asian crisis dominated White House strategy sessions, with many senior officials fearing it could puncture Wall Street's party. But the sense of crisis abated last September after Russia's economic collapse was contained more quickly than anyone expected. And gradually the impetus for wide-ranging reforms slackened, and grand plans for remaking the world financial system became modest adjustments, including new I.M.F. mechanisms to respond earlier to "economic contagion" hitting otherwise well-run countries.
Some problems that contributed to the crisis seem to have been at least temporarily addressed. Virtually all the crisis-hit countries frittered away state foreign currency reserves trying to keep their currencies strong -- and tried to hide that news from investors. Now that the I.M.F. has pressed countries to publish more information, data once considered state secrets can now be found on the Fund's Internet site (www.imf.org).
The Thai baht and the Korean won float freely, and the countries have rebuilt their war-chests of foreign currency mostly by exporting to the United States, and stacking up the dollars they get in return.
Moreover, Asian countries have largely halted their practice of borrowing on short terms from abroad to finance big, long-term projects. That proved disastrous when projects ground to a halt and currencies fell, forcing companies and banks to repay huge debts immediately.
Other bad habits are proving harder to break. No Asian country has yet put an effective bankruptcy law on its books, meaning it is still impossible to wipe out insolvent businesses, settle with creditors, and rebuild viable companies. Thailand has come closest -- opening its first bankruptcy court last month and staffing it with 60 judges.
Still, skeptics say it will take months for those judges to master complex bankruptcy law. And they will find it hard to fight proprietors of debt-ridden companies, some of whom sit in the Thai Senate and have bitterly opposed the passage of stronger laws.
 
Companies Tell Debtors: 'Go Fly a Kite'
In Indonesia, where the laws are even more toothless, the Government has resorted to shaming its corporate sector. The Indonesian Bank Restructuring Authority recently named the 100 worst debtors in local newspapers. But even conglomerates on the list, like the Bakrie Group, are dragging their feet on resolving their debt problems.
Bakrie has offered to give its banks equity in return for canceling its $1 billion in debt. The Export-Import Bank and other creditors object that the plan would leave the Bakrie family, which dug the conglomerate into a hole in the first place, with considerable influence. And they believe Mr. Bakrie has wildly overstated the value of that equity. Still, some local bankers say Bakrie's creditors may have little choice but to go along.
"When companies tell their creditors to go through regular legal channels, that basically means, 'Go fly a kite,' " said a senior official at an American bank in Jakarta, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
Rizal Ramli, an Indonesian economist, said the Government lacked the courage to go after well-connected tycoons. "During the Suharto era," he said, "there were only five conglomerates that were untouchable because of their ties to Suharto. Now, there seem to be many more."
As long as Asia's banks cannot pursue debtors, they cannot clean up their balance sheets. Nearly half of all loans carried on the books of Thai banks are classified as nonperforming -- meaning they will probably never be repaid. As a result, Thailand's banks have not made fresh loans, hampering economic recovery, even with a resurgent currency and stock market. The same is true in Indonesia, Malaysia, and Korea -- and of course in Japan, whose banking problems continue to affect the rest of Asia.
Hopes that the crisis would bring accountability to Asian business are fading fast, too. In Malaysia, the infrastructure giant Renong ran up $2.4 billion in debts, despite winning lucrative franchises to run toll roads and bridges. Renong's creditors blamed the youthful chairman, Halim Saad.
Renong is now being rescued by a $2.2 billion bond offering by one of its subsidiaries, which operates Malaysia's key north-south toll highway. Although the bonds are not guaranteed by the Government -- which would make it a direct bailout -- analysts say it will result in higher tolls or force the Government to extend the company's franchise. Mr. Halim, a protege of Finance Minister Daim Zainuddin and a favorite of Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, has meanwhile kept his job.
 
Risks of Backsliding In a Very Clubby World
Nowhere, perhaps, is the danger of Asia backsliding more apparent than in the case of Philippine Airlines. The flagship carrier of the Philippines has been staggering under $2.2 billion in debt -- the victim of costly fleet expansion at the time of the regional crisis.
Philippine Airlines, commonly known as PAL, is controlled by Lucio C. Tan, one of the country's leading tycoons and a loyal supporter of the Philippine President, Joseph P. Estrada, who used a PAL plane for free during last year's presidential campaign.
The Government has so far refused to bail out the airline, but Mr. Estrada has made it a personal mission to keep Philippine Airlines flying. He has backed a rehabilitation plan that would leave Mr. Tan, a tobacco-and-beer mogul, in control. The Ex-Im Bank, which financed PAL's purchase of Boeing planes, opposes the plan -- and seized a PAL Boeing 747 this year when it flew into the United States.
A court forced the bank to return the plane, but now it has threatened to seize four Boeing 747's, saying it fears PAL is not maintaining them well enough to preserve their value as collateral. Mr. Tan has not responded to interview requests.
Philippine Airlines proposes to recover -- by getting the Government to reduce the number of rival carriers allowed to fly into the Philippines. That would run counter to the movement to open Asia's markets. "This would be a disaster, not just for the tourist industry but for the country in general," said Emmanuel Gonzalez, the president of the Hotel, Resort and Restaurant Association of Cebu, a resort island.
As the Asian crisis recedes, Mr. Gonzalez is finally seeing his business improve. But the Philippine Airlines case reminds him how little has changed in the clubby world of Asian commerce. "When people here say, 'Wouldn't it be awful if we lost our flag carrier?' " he said, "I wonder if they're really saying, 'Wouldn't it be awful if we didn't get our free tickets anymore?' "

 CORRECTION:

He was Emmanuel Gonzalez, president of the Hotel, Resort and Restaurant Association of Cebu, a resort island.

GRAPHIC: Graphs: "As the Economic Crisis Fades, So Does the Urgency for Reform"
 
SOUTH KOREA
A surging stock market has lifted domestic demand, and exports are strong. But the Government has yet to tackle its powerful, debt-plagued conglomerates, known as chaebol, and momentum toward opening markets are losing steam.
 
THAILAND
Thailand finally passed a bankruptcy law. Banks have been able to raise fresh capital, but they have made little progress whittling down bad loans. The stock market recovery has outpaced that of the economy as a whole.
 
INDONESIA
Free elections and a measure of stability are the biggest changes. While the economic contraction is not as crippling as feared, there has been little progress in over-hauling a shattered banking system. Tycoons still demand -- and get -- preferential treatment.
 
MALAYSIA
Malaysia stymied those who predicted that its capital and currency controls would choke the economy. The currency is stable, and foreign reserves are up. But the restructuring of companies has been glacial.
 
RUSSIA
Nearly a year after the ruble's collapse, the country's economy is slowly sinking, but Russians simply endure it. Political chaos has made any real reforms impossible. The I.M.F. is about to lend Russia enough money to keep the country from default.
 
BRAZIL
Perhaps the clearest case of an American-backed I.M.F. bailout doing the job. The economy has bounced back from its troubles last winter far faster than anyone expected. But the rest of Latin America remains mired in recession.

HEADLINE: THE DOCTOR'S WORLD;
In Africa, a Deadly Silence About AIDS Is Lifting

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE K. ALTMAN, M.D. 

 BODY:
Earlier this year, AIDS became the leading killer in Africa, just 18 years after the infection was first recognized. But if political and religious leaders had responded with effective public health programs much earlier, they might have prevented hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of deaths.
Some leaders simply denied the scientific evidence that H.I.V. was being transmitted in their countries. Others mistakenly believed they had more pressing health problems to address. 
 Now, as the epidemic in Africa becomes an even greater catastrophe, Dr. Peter Piot, Assistant Secretary General of the United Nations and head of its AIDS programs, says he sees signs of momentum among African leaders to fight the disease. The momentum promises to slow the relentless transmission of H.I.V., conveyed on the continent primarily through heterosexual sex, Dr. Piot said in an interview.
Nelson Mandela, the former President of South Africa; his successor, Thabo Mbeki, and Dr. Negasso Gidada, the President of Ethiopia, are among the leaders of countries with high infection rates to speak out on AIDS for the first time recently in their own countries and to beef up prevention efforts.
And, in May, at their annual meeting in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, African finance ministers for the first time called AIDS a major threat to economic and social development.
The United Nations General Assembly recently called for a 25 percent reduction in new H.I.V. infections among young people over the next five years in the countries most affected by AIDS. And the Clinton Administration, appalled by the staggering dimensions of the African AIDS epidemic, is planning an initiative to help, Dr. Piot said.
Large-scale efforts clearly are needed. In sub-Saharan Africa, H.I.V. has infected 34 million people and killed 11.5 million since 1981, dwarfing malaria and tuberculosis. Last year, AIDS accounted for 1.8 million deaths in sub-Saharan Africa, nearly double the 1 million deaths from malaria and about nine times the 209,000 deaths from tuberculosis, the World Health Organization says.
Based on meetings with leaders of 10 African countries this year, Dr. Piot says he has noted a striking change in attitudes toward AIDS: at earlier meetings, he initiated discussions about AIDS; at the recent sessions, African leaders admitted their problems and asked for help.
"It is such a big change," Dr. Piot, a 50-year-old Belgian and a pioneer in AIDS research in Africa, said in a brief visit to New York. In years past, Dr. Piot said, even meeting with an African head of state was difficult.
He recalled an incident about 15 years ago when he and another AIDS expert waited nearly a day in the office of the Kenyan Minister of Health while officials debated whether to expel the two because they had talked to reporters about AIDS in Kenya.
In 1985, Zaire refused to give me a visa to report on AIDS, and the Government of Kenya confiscated issues of The International Herald Tribune, which carried my articles, as leaders denied the severity of their AIDS problem.
African political leaders remained silent even when AIDS was killing members of their own families.
In 1985, the press secretary to Kenneth D. Kaunda, then the President of Zambia, denied my request for an interview about AIDS. The press secretary threatened to expel me for reporting on what he called an American disease. A year later, Mr. Kaunda lost a son to AIDS.
Three years after that, Mr. Kaunda became one of the first to speak out. In describing his family's loss at an international AIDS meeting in Montreal, Mr. Kaunda said that if scientists failed to cure AIDS, the epidemic would become "a soft nuclear bomb on human life." But in the years of Mr. Kaunda's silence, hundreds of thousands of Africans became infected.
Yet even now realism has not fully set in. Dr. Piot still encounters government officials who "ask me why I use the word epidemic," he said.
It takes an average of nine years for H.I.V. to progress to AIDS, and the virus spread widely and silently for a decade before being discovered. Yet even with the undetected early spread, there was time to initiate programs to prevent subsequent infections, as was done effectively among gay men in the United States and other developed countries.
In South Africa, H.I.V. rates soared during Nelson Mandela's Administration, a fact that he later acknowledged.
"It's the silence that is letting this disease sweep through the country," Mr. Mandela said on World AIDS Day in December. "It is time to break the silence."
Dr. Piot applauded Mr. Mandela and Mr. Mbeki, his successor, for calling national attention to AIDS, but said, "It took a long time, and a lot of deaths could have been prevented if they had spoken out earlier."
Today, AIDS continues to thin the ranks of Africa's small middle class, killing at least one teacher a day in Malawi and the Ivory Coast. It is devastating already weak economies across Africa and forcing children to drop out of school to till the farms and care for sick parents.
Dr. Piot challenged African finance ministers at their annual meeting in Addis Ababa in May to learn more about how AIDS was devastating their economies.
"After my speech, there was dead silence," Dr. Piot said. "I thought, another of those moments of supreme denial."
But then, he added, "One after the other, the finance ministers spoke, often making personal references to AIDS in the family or a colleague."
That evening, many joined him for a drink. "The problem was how to stop the discussions," Dr. Piot said. "That was a great moment for me."
The next day, Dr. Gidada, the President of Ethiopia, and His Holiness Abune Paulos, the Patriarch of the Ethiopian Orthodox Church, shook hands with H.I.V.-infected Ethiopians in meeting with them publicly for the first time, Dr. Piot said.
"That may have been a small thing, but it was highly symbolic in Africa," he added.
Uganda, which acted early, showed that educational programs could change sexual behavior after AIDS had struck in vast numbers.
Senegal also thwarted the assault of AIDS, Dr. Piot said, taking "vigorous action" on sex education, AIDS prevention and condom promotion to keep the infection rate below 2 percent. "It is a major political challenge to invest in AIDS prevention when there is not a huge problem," Dr. Piot said, "yet that is exactly what Senegal has done."
Through programs that political and religious leaders encouraged, the Senegalese postponed having first sexual intercourse, used condoms more often and had sex with fewer partners and less sex with prostitutes, surveys there showed.
Nigeria, Africa's most populous country, stands in stark contrast to Senegal, with an infection rate of about 9 percent and rising. A new regime appears to be willing to tackle the AIDS problem in Nigeria, which the previous regime denied, Dr. Piot said.
Dr. Piot's team has a budget of $60 million a year, only enough to act as a catalyst for others to undertake prevention efforts. His AIDS team, for example, calls on African leaders to urge drastic efforts to fight the epidemic.
The latest figures show that international aid paid for $150 million of the $165 million spent on AIDS prevention in Africa in 1997. Uganda accounted for much of the $15 million that the African countries spent.
"It's a scandal that African countries have not spent more," Dr. Piot said.
Although the World Bank and other international agencies make money available for projects in Africa, much of it goes unspent because of bureaucratic complexities and other problems.
Dr. Piot said his agency was trying to identify untapped funds to direct toward prevention efforts, while recognizing that those nations "cannot afford everything for AIDS, certainly not lifetime anti-retroviral drugs."
Taken in combination, those drugs can cost $15,000 a year for a single patient, require adherence to rigid schedules, and often demand sophisticated monitoring tests unavailable in developing countries. That means few Africans can benefit from the drug cocktails, which are prolonging lives and often restoring health among H.I.V.-positive people in developed nations.
To reach a largely captive audience, and one in its sexual prime, Dr. Piot is encouraging governments to spend more of their military budgets, which usually receive high priority, on AIDS prevention.
In Uganda, the infection rate is about 10 percent in the general population and up to 30 percent in the military. "There are African countries where it is said that more than 50 percent of all the military are H.I.V. infected," Dr. Piot said, "and that is a problem of national security."
It also means that many spouses and children are infected. So Dr. Piot's team aims to encourage teachers' unions, school systems and youth groups to join prevention programs in Africa.
In some West African countries, for example, Scouting groups have created an AIDS badge for those who do good deeds for people with H.I.V., Dr. Piot said.
His agency has also teamed on AIDS efforts with Caritas, a Catholic health agency based in the Vatican that is responsible for health care in many African countries, Dr. Piot said.
Although the Vatican does not approve of the use of condoms, Dr. Piot said that he had seen many Catholic priests, nuns and organizations promote condom use in Africa.
In June 1998, Dr. Piot's agency issued the first country-by-country analysis of H.I.V. It showed that one in four adults was infected with H.I.V. in certain parts of Africa and that AIDS was hitting so fiercely that it compared to the greatest epidemics of history. The report was a crucial factor in changing political attitudes, Dr. Piot said.
Dr. Piot said he was criticized for the report by many Western epidemiologists and health workers, who called the figures exaggerated.
"A lot of the criticism had to do with turf battles, from scientists who believe their disease is more important than someone else's," Dr. Piot said, "and it's the type of nonsensical competition that exists in all countries."
But now, the criticism has come full circle. In 1992, a team headed by the late Dr. Jonathan M. Mann at the Harvard School of Public Health, published estimates of H.I.V. infections in sub-Saharan Africa ranging from 20.8 million to 33.6 million by 2000.
The World Health Organization criticized Dr. Mann's estimates as excessive. Now, academic scientists are criticizing the figures of Dr. Piot's team. "When we look at the figures today, they are worse than the scenarios Jonathan had published," Dr. Piot said.
Larger budgets are needed. But pumping money into a country where AIDS is a low priority will not end the epidemic. "If a country does not recognize that it has an AIDS problem, then it is not willing to take on the tough questions," Dr. Piot said. "Outside support for something that can only be solved from the inside will not work.
"We can only win," he added, "if there is a mass movement."

HEADLINE: China's Bid To Send Astronauts Into Space

BYLINE: By WARREN E. LEARY 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
China is closer to becoming only the third nation in history to launch humans into space, a feat that could come as early as next year, say international space experts.
After years of saying it would "one day" or "soon" put people into space, and initiating and postponing efforts to do so, the Chinese government has finally embarked on a serious program to make it happen, these experts believe. 
 "I think evidence of a manned space program in China is very real and that they are serious," said Charles Vick, a space issues expert with the Federation of American Scientists, a Washington policy group.
According to specialists following Chinese space developments, Chinese officials had hoped to put two astronauts into space by October to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the Communist takeover of China. But, they said, delays in developing a new rocket for lifting heavy payloads, and problems with other equipment, make such a crewed flight unlikely until at least next year.
Nonetheless, the first flight in the program, an unmanned test of the new rocket and spacecraft, could still come in October.
"Assuming there is no major failure during the first unmanned flight of the system, I would expect a Chinese manned flight a year to 15 months afterwards," said Phillip S. Clark, a British space consultant who closely follows the Chinese program. "Only the United States and Russia have the capability to send people into space and China seems ready to become only the third nation to join this exclusive club."
Lynn Cline, the official in charge of external affairs at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, said the space agency had no detailed knowledge of China's plans. "For many years, they have set as a goal building a manned spacecraft, and earlier said they wanted to make a manned flight this year," Ms. Cline said. However, she said, the agency has heard that this flight has been delayed for unknown reasons and that there will be an unmanned mission instead this year.
Renewed interest in human spaceflight by China flared last month when pictures said to show the Chinese spacecraft and rocket suddenly appeared on the Internet from an anonymous source. The pictures depict a spacecraft based on the Russian Soyuz design atop a large rocket with four booster motors attached to the sides.
Mr. Clark, in an article to appear next month in the British magazine Jane's Intelligence Review, describes the rocket as the Chang Zheng 2F, an upgraded version of one of China's largest satellite launchers, the Long March CZ-3E. The new version is capable of placing a 10 metric-ton payload into low Earth orbit, he said, while the Chinese manned spacecraft weighs about 8.4 metric tons.
The spacecraft itself resembles the Russian Soyuz, which is built in three sections -- a propulsion section, an orbital section and a return module -- but it is larger and carries two pairs of solar-power panels instead of one set as the Russian craft does, Mr. Clark said. The central orbital module, instead of being spheroidal like the Soyuz, is more cylindrical, he said. The Chinese version is designed to make docking with other craft and transferring crew members easy.
The detailed color photographs were supposedly taken by a construction worker at China's Jiuquan launching site near the Gobi desert. They show a completed rocket and spacecraft being rolled out of an assembly building to a gantry and firing pad.
The new building looks a lot like NASA's giant Vehicle Assembly Building at Cape Canaveral, Fla., where Apollo moon rockets, and now space shuttles, were put together for missions. The rocket is on a mechanical crawler with tank-like treads that slowly move it to a launching pad, just as American shuttles are transported. Previously, Chinese space rockets were assembled from components on the pad before launchings, not transported there ready to fly.
Initial discussion about the pictures focused on whether they were clever fakes. Some spacecraft experts questioned whether the pictures were of small-scale models or images put together with computer-aided drawing and photo manipulation software. After carefully examining details in the pictures and calculating the size and positions of elements in the images, most experts now believe they are authentic, for the most part.
"There's too much detail there to be faked," Mr. Vick said.
However, Mr. Clark and other experts said the image of the large assembly and integration building where the rockets are prepared may have been enhanced in some way. The pictures taken by the worker are supposed to be from a promotional brochure created for the construction company that put up the building, and that company may have been trying to emphasize its work in the images, Mr. Clark said.
Some experts also question the relatively close proximity of the assembly building to the launching pad, compared with the arrangement at Cape Canaveral, as evidence of possible photo manipulation. But Mr. Vick noted that the launching arrangement for the new European Ariane 5 rocket also has the service building and launching pad similarly close together.
China launched its first satellite in 1970 and has maintained an active space program that includes launching commercial satellites for clients in other countries.
Chinese officials began discussing sending humans into space in the late 1970's and reports of astronaut training began emerging in the 1980's. Talk of manned spaceflight then ended for several years, partly because of social upheaval in China, and revived in the early 1990's.
The push toward the current manned flight effort, dubbed Project 921, began in March 1995, when China made a deal with Russia to acquire space technology, including information on life-support systems, docking mechanisms for spacecraft and spacesuits. In October 1996, two Chinese astronauts and more than a dozen trainers and support workers arrived at the Russian cosmonaut training center outside Moscow and stayed for about a year, experts said. At about the same time, Beijing announced plans to fly a manned spacecraft for the nation's anniversary celebration, but has said little about the program since.
Officials and scientists questioned about the program in China give conflicting answers, with many declining to comment on possible dates for manned flights until the government announces them.
But one thing Chinese scientists and outside experts agree on is that most of the technology being developed is Chinese, even though some is an adaptation of Russian ideas and equipment.
Dr. Joan Johnson-Freese, an instructor at the Asia Pacific Center for Security Studies in Honolulu, and author of the book, "The Chinese Space Program: A Mystery Within a Maze" (Krieger Publishing, 1998), said the Chinese always have multiple agendas. China wants to prove that it is a technically sophisticated nation and a great power that does not need outside help, she said.
Recent investigations by Congress and the Pentagon that accuse China of stealing secrets and benefiting from American companies illegally transferring rocket and satellite information to China have embarrassed the Chinese and given them something to prove, she said.
"There is no economic payback for a manned space program," Dr. Johnson-Freese said. "The manned space club is very exclusive. It's all for the prestige."
China is willing to spend part of its limited funds to develop technology that is distinctly its own for sending humans into space, she said.
"This way, China can say: 'This is not U.S. technology. This is not Russian Technology. This is very much Chinese technology,' " she said. "It's saying, 'We don't need to steal your secrets and expertise -- we have our own.' "

Chart: "A Great Leap Upward"
Rumors are circulating that China is poised to launch humans into orbit. China's space program has been orbiting satellites for almost 30 years. Below are some key dates.
 
APRIL 24, 1970
China launches its first satellite, the 381-pound DFH-1, aboard a three-stage rocket. Lofted primarily for propaganda purposes, it broadcast the music of Dong Fang Hong (The East Is Red).
 
MARCH 3, 1971
China's second satellite, Shi Jian 1, was similar to DFH-1, but replaced music with scientific instruments - a cosmic ray detector, an X-ray detector and a magnetometer.
 
NOV. 26, 1975
China's first recoverable satellite, Fanhui Shi Weixing, presumed to be carrying prototypes of ground- observing cameras, is launched and retrieved three days later.
 
SEPT. 19, 1981
Three satellites are launched aboard one FB-1 rocket.
 
APRIL 8, 1984
China's first successful communi-cations satellite, Shiyan Tongbu Tongxin Weixing, is launched into a geostationary orbit and functions for more than four years.
 
APRIL 7, 1990
China flies its first non-Chinese commercial payload - Asiasat 1. Originally launched from a United States space shuttle in 1984 as Westar 6, the satellite was stranded in orbit when a booster rocket failed and had to be rescued by a subsequent shuttle (above) and sold to Asiasat.
 
JULY 16, 1990
The CZ-2E heavy-lift launching vehicle, capable of placing nearly 20,000 pounds into low Earth orbit, makes its maiden flight. Experts speculate that an advanced version of the booster will place Chinese astronauts into orbit.
 
FEB. 14, 1996
Six people are killed and a $126 million Intelsat satellite is lost when guidance system problems cause its booster rocket, a CZ-3B, to crash on its maiden flight.
 
OCTOBER 1996
Two Chinese astronaut trainees, Li Qinglong and Wu Jie, arrive in Moscow for spaceflight training. They return to China in September 1997, and are thought to be in line for the first manned flight.

U.S. and Canada Get $125 Million Ruling on Europe Beef Ban

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH OLSON 

DATELINE: GENEVA, July 12

 BODY:
A World Trade Organization panel ruled today that the United States and Canada were entitled to nearly $125 million in sanctions from the European Union because of its illegal ban on hormone-treated beef.
The amount was about half what the United States had sought but more than double what the European Union had thought was reasonable. 
 The arbitration panel's decision clears the way for the United States and Canada to move to the next stage of the sanctions process under the rules of the Geneva-based global trading group. They must now seek formal permission to impose the sanctions; a range of European imports could be hit with 100 percent tariffs, in effect doubling their price.
Unless the European Union rescinds the hormone-beef ban or reaches a settlement with the United States and Canada, the sanctions could be formally imposed on July 26 when the World Trade Organization's dispute resolution body holds its next regular meeting.
The European Union never complied with a ruling by the trade organization two months ago that its ban on hormone-treated beef was illegal. The 15-nation European trading bloc has said that it is investigating evidence that shows such beef poses health risks. The United States and Canada have said that the hormones, which are used to promote cattle growth, are harmless.
Although cattle producers in the United States expressed disappointment with the scaled-down damages, officials from both sides in the trade dispute sought to put the best face on the outcome.
Sir Leon Brittan, outgoing trade commissioner of the European Union, which had hoped for a figure of about $53 million, said the arbitration panel's ruling showed that the claims of the United States and Canada were extravagant. Rita Hayes, the United States trade representative at the World Trade Organization, said the ruling recognized the "serious damage" the exporters had suffered.
In an earlier trade confrontation, the United States eventually won authorization for $191.4 million in punitive duties on European exports because of the European Union's policy of favoring imports of bananas from former European colonies in the Caribbean. As in that dispute, United States officials moved quickly to activate trade organization mechanisms and seek retaliatory measures in the beef dispute.
The beef dispute reflects profoundly different views in the United States and Europe over altered or adulterated foods. European fear of food tampering increased with the outbreak of "mad cow" disease in Britain several years ago. More recently, those anxieties intensified over a scandal in Belgium over chicken and other food products contaminated with the cancer-causing chemical dioxin.
The United States has a strong regulatory body in its Food and Drug Administration, but there is no European-wide body to track food adulteration.
The preliminary United States list of European goods that could be sanctioned in the beef dispute includes canned meats, Roquefort cheese, truffles, paprika, chewing gum, chocolate and mineral water. The Canadian list includes beef, cucumbers, gingerbread, gin, vodka and soup.

Treasury PricesRally as Argentine Markets Drop Sharply

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
Bond prices rallied, driving yields to six-week lows, as plunging Argentine stocks and bonds led a rout in Latin America that raised the allure of Treasuries.
"You're seeing some flow out of those markets into Treasuries," which are among the safest investments, said Dave Jallits, who helps invest $5.5 billion at Strategic Fixed Income in Arlington, Va. Problems in Argentina and neighboring countries may also limit the extent of Federal Reserve interest rate increases, he said. 
 Bonds received an additional lift from the strong demand for the Ford Motor Company's record-setting $8.6 billion debt sale on Friday, a sign other corporate sales may find ready buyers. Expectations that Government reports later this week will point to tame inflation also bolstered Treasuries, traders said.
The price of the benchmark 30-year bond rose 1 8/32, to 90 30/32. Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, fell to 5.90 percent from 6.00 percent on Friday.
Bonds gained as Argentina's benchmark Merval index slumped 8.7 percent, a three-month low. A J. P. Morgan & Company index of Argentine dollar debt lost 2.6 percent. That drove its yield to 9.53 percentage points more than comparable United States Treasuries, wider even than Venezuela, rated two notches lower by debt-rating companies.
Argentine bonds fell as rising interest rates and a slower-than-expected recovery from recession prompted an investor flight. The securities also fell as Eduardo Duhalde -- the Peronist candidate for president -- told a radio interviewer that he would entreat Pope John Paul II to support a debt moratorium for cash-short nations like Argentina.
Following are the results of yesterday's Treasury auction of three- and six-month bills:

HEADLINE: The Politics of Patients' Rights

 BODY:
After a year of stalling by the Republicans, the Senate began debate yesterday on how to curb unfair health insurance practices. There is widespread public concern that the shift to managed care has left consumers defenseless when they are improperly denied needed care by their health plans. That is the rationale for Federal action.
Knowing that voters care about this issue, Republican leaders are offering a bill that, they hope, will give them political cover at election time. But the bill is weak, and will do little to deter wrongful actions by health plans. The Democrats will try as best they can to strengthen it with amendments aimed at closing loopholes. 
 The Republican bill applies only to the 48 million Americans covered by plans in which large employers act as their own insurers. That would leave 110 million Americans in all other plans unprotected. The bill would extend grievance rights and allow external review of benefit denials to 75 million more people. But those rights would be tightly restricted, and there are enough loopholes to allow unscrupulous plans to circumvent the appeals process. The bill, for example, may bind external reviewers to a plan's definition of medical necessity, even if that definition is unfairly narrow.
The bill does not adequately insure access to specialists. Nor does it amend the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, known as Erisa, to allow patients covered by private employer-sponsored insurance to sue health plans for damages caused by wrongful denials of coverage. Current law allows no meaningful recovery in that circumstance, allowing insurers to escape responsibility. When Erisa was created in the 1970's, there was no widespread problem with denial of care since most insurance was based on traditional fee-for-service care. But the health system has changed, and the players that now control access to care should not be shielded from liability.
The Republicans argue that more regulation will increase costs to industry and consumers. But that argument could apply to all consumer protection laws designed to limit marketplace abuses. The need for a basic framework of rights is particularly strong in a health care system where a patient has very few options once a plan decides to deny coverage. Moreover, the modest increased costs are well worth the benefits. Improving consumer confidence can help sustain the growth of managed care, which remains a practical and necessary strategy for containing costs.

HEADLINE: Lessons From the Blackout

 BODY:
Last week's blackout in northern Manhattan and power shortages in New Jersey provided timely reminders that the New York metropolitan region's power supply is not inexhaustible. On the contrary, a robust economy, combined with the increasingly widespread use of computers, fax machines and other high-tech devices, has created an appetite for electricity that could someday exceed the region's capacity to generate it. One answer is to build more power plants and transmission capacity. But that should be only one element in a broader strategy that seeks as well to conserve energy and exploit newer, more efficient technologies.
Most of the post-blackout criticism has focused on Consolidated Edison and its delivery problems uptown. Though Con Ed has one of the lowest rates of power failure in the industry, it clearly needs to upgrade old feeder cables like those that failed in Washington Heights and Inwood. But pressure must also be brought to bear on Albany. Inspired by utility deregulation, Gov. George Pataki has opened New York's doors to new power plants that can deliver electricity more efficiently, and there are now six applications before the state to build or expand plants. Yet because of a bizarre legislative foul-up, there is no state agency authorized to grant siting permits. Until that regulatory catch is resolved, nothing will happen. 
 Even then it will take several years to build new plants, which means that other strategies must be explored. One such strategy, familiar but vital, is energy conservation. Consumers should be encouraged to buy air-conditioners and other appliances that do more but consume less power, through incentive programs offered by the utilities. In the early 1990's power companies spent $300 million statewide on conservation programs, a figure that has dwindled to $66 million. Albany can revive the program. Meanwhile, businesses should take advantage of new efficiencies in equipment and building design, and Congress should think about targeted tax credits.
A parallel strategy would involve the aggressive application of newer technologies, chiefly the "on-site" generation of power from photovoltaics and fuel cells. Such devices, attached to buildings and homes, will reduce the burden on utilities like Con Ed and, equally important, provide a reliable source of power during emergencies. For example, the blackout may have damaged or delayed hundreds of experiments that medical researchers from Columbia University were conducting at laboratories in Washington Heights. Reliable on-site power could have provided a margin of safety.
Although the long-term solution will involve building new plants and upgrading transmission lines, as well as replacing unreliable components of the existing system, energy efficiency and on-site power are of major importance. They are also environmentally desirable. Conservation, by definition, produces no pollution, indeed reduces it. Fuel cells are also relatively clean sources of power.
The blackout inconvenienced many New Yorkers. But it may also have forced the city, the state and industry to think creatively about how to address the needs of all New Yorkers.

HEADLINE: Pakistani Makes Case For a Halt To Fighting

BYLINE: By BARRY BEARAK 

DATELINE: ISLAMABAD, Pakistan, July 12

 BODY:
Castigated by many as a betrayer of the dream of a liberated Kashmir, Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif said tonight in a televised speech that -- to the contrary -- he has helped usher the cause onto the world stage and prudently steered away from an all-out war.
"People are not aware of the anxiety we passed through during the past one and a half months," he said, explaining why he had coaxed Pakistani-backed guerrillas to return from mountaintop redoubts they had seized a few miles inside Indian-controlled Kashmir. "This is no secret that the threat of a big war with India was looming by the way things had deteriorated between India and Pakistan." 
 He added ominously, "Missiles with nuclear warheads were directed toward us and our air force was put on alert."
The 25-minute speech was the Prime Minister's first public statement since he returned from a hastily arranged visit to Washington on July 4. There he promised President Clinton to take "concrete steps" to end the fighting, which had pitted several hundred well-armed Muslim infiltrators against the Indian Air Force and battalions of infantry.
The trip to Washington puzzled and angered many here. Jubilant news accounts had led them to believe the well-positioned guerrillas were making easy prey of woefully vulnerable Indians attempting frontal assaults up steep peaks. The fighting had put the emotionally charged Kashmir issue onto front pages worldwide, and then the Prime Minister seemed to knuckle under to American pressure.
But with a troubled political opposition, a weakened judiciary and an intimidated press, there is little on the political horizon to challenge Mr. Sharif. In fact, for all the discontent, even the nation's usually intrepid Islamic fundamentalists have been unable to mount anything but relatively muted street protests.
"Our decision to give diplomacy another chance, to try it once again, is not a result of haste, nor has it been taken under pressure," Mr. Sharif insisted. "A sage has said that it takes more courage to come out of a war than to start a war."
He said the guerrillas had made the world understand that "Kashmir is a nuclear flashpoint."
A withdrawal of the fighters -- known here as the mujahedeen, or Muslim holy warriors -- began on Saturday. While the pullback may be a testament to the Prime Minister's persuasive skills, it also lends support to consistent Indian accusations that the invaders were mostly Pakistan Army regulars, a view shared by many analysts.
Mujahedeen organizations have not helped Mr. Sharif's credibility. While he thanked the guerrillas today for heeding his plea, leaders of several of the groups called Mr. Sharif a traitor and denied they were making any retreat at all.
In a typical criticism, Rifaat Hussain, a professor of international relations in Islamabad, said: "Nawaz shouldn't have had such an early loss of nerve. Now he's nowhere. His idea of defusing the crisis was to run to Washington."
Indeed, in his speech, Mr. Sharif made much of the assurance he received from Mr. Clinton that the President would take a personal interest in settling the Kashmir situation, a 52-year-old dispute that has led the nations into two all-out wars. "An assurance by the leader of a power like America is not insignificant," Mr. Sharif emphasized.
The Pakistanis want the world to compel India to permit a plebiscite, a vote to which India once committed itself. The vote would allow the Kashmiris -- most of whom are Muslims -- to choose whether they want to belong to largely Hindu India or Muslim Pakistan.
Mr. Sharif's speech was quickly assailed by political rivals. The leading opposition, the Pakistan Peoples Party, called for his resignation, but the party has called for his resignation before, and it is a party in disarray. Its leader, the former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto, lives abroad, and faces arrest if she return because she has been convicted of corruption.
Democracy is constantly rumored to be endangered in Pakistan, which has a powerful military that is said to be frustrated by inept and corrupt civilians at the helm. But military leaders seem to support Mr. Sharif's decision to reduce tensions with India, which has a numerically superior military and a less feeble economy.
Tonight the Prime Minister spoke of resuming the "Lahore Declaration process," a high-level dialogue that began in February with a bus trip to Pakistan by India's Prime Minister, Atal Behari Vajpayee.
But any talks are likely to be heavy with distrust. As Indians see it, Mr. Sharif has proven a duplicitous rogue who pretended to be a peacemaker while endorsing a plan by his generals to launch an adventure into Kashmir. To the Pakistanis, Mr. Vajpayee is an opportunist who has used the conflict to whip up a war hysteria to benefit himself in coming elections.
Their goals concerning the Kashmir dispute are different:
Mr. Sharif hopes that the past two months of alarming headlines will cause the world to recognize the danger of the situation. Mr. Vajpayee welcomes no such attention and says Kashmir is best kept a bilateral concern.
Among the more stirring parts of Mr. Sharif's speech was his likening of the Kashmir situation to a volcano, and the mujahedeen to lava. "As long as lava boils, it finds its way to the plains," he said. "And the Kashmiri resistance, like that lava, will find someplace else. And it will never cool off."

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS;
Argentine Stocks Fall Again, and Other Latin Markets Follow

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS 

DATELINE: BUENOS AIRES, July 12

 BODY:
The Argentine stock market had its worst session in seven months today, falling 8.7 percent on fears that the Government deficit was widening and a year-old recession was deepening.
The broad drop came on the heels of a 4.4 percent decline of the main stock index on Thursday, the last day of trading before the country's Independence Day holiday on Friday. 
 The tumble in what was until recently a favorite emerging market contributed to a selling mood that pulled down stock prices across Latin America; Brazil's market fell nearly 3 percent and Mexico's market shed 1.5 percent. The slide in Argentina also caused concerns on Wall Street about more areas of potential weakness.
"Argentina faces severe challenges as it tries to deal with a strengthening U.S. dollar, weak agricultural commodity prices and stagnant global export markets," wrote David Malpass, senior economist at Bear Stearns, in a report today. Mr. Malpass attributed today's sliding stock prices to "shortfalls in tax revenues during the recession and concerns over congressional inaction."
Concerns about the health of the Argentine economy have grown since the Government revised its economic data a month ago. The decline in first-quarter output was recalculated to 3 percent, from 2.8 percent. At the start of the year, the Government projected that the economy would grow this year, but economists now estimate that the contraction could be as steep as 2.5 percent.
The sharp devaluation of the Brazilian real in January has made Argentine exports increasingly uncompetitive with the country's largest trading partner, particularly hurting the automotive and steel industries.
With tax receipts falling sharply, the Government has also had to raise the yearly fiscal deficit to $5.1 billion -- nearly double the number first discussed in negotiations with the International Monetary Fund.
And unemployment is expected to climb to at least 15 percent in the next few weeks, almost 3 points higher than last October. Private forecasters in Argentina have estimated that industrial production has fallen nearly 13 percent in the last year -- well above Government estimates.
There is a growing impression among investors that President Carlos Saul Menem is losing influence in his final months in office. Last week, he and his congressional supporters backed down on a new vehicle tax to pay teacher raises when tens of thousands of truck drivers went on strike across the country. To some analysts, the retreat suggested that the Government would also back down on needed tax measures under pressure from other interest groups.
The two leading presidential candidates have also contributed to the market's anxiety by not declaring their economic policies.
Both of them -- Gov. Eduardo Duhalde of Buenos Aires, the candidate of the ruling Justicialist party, and Mayor Fernando de la Rua of Buenos Aires, of the opposition Alianza party -- also hurt investor confidence recently when they suggested that Argentina would need relief from payments on its $130 billion foreign debt. This weekend, Mr. Duhalde said he would seek support from Pope John Paul II for a debt moratorium for struggling countries like Argentina.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING;
Th e organization that specializes in the business of doing good is doing well on the Internet.

BYLINE: By Lisa Napoli 

 BODY:
THE Advertising Council, the nonprofit organization that produces and distributes public-service announcements, has risen in the last four months from 23d to 9th place in rankings of the most visible advertisers on the Internet, according to Nielsen/Net Ratings, an Internet measurement service.
That is not because the council has increased its advertising budget. It has no such budget. As it does in other media, on the Internet the council relies on the benevolence of Web sites to run its advertisements in unsold space. 
 As a result, banner advertisements that the council created on behalf of nonprofit groups on recycling, drunken driving, crime prevention and nearly 20 other public-service causes appeared 133 million times on the Web last month. Such messages reached 16.2 percent of all people who surf from home, according to Nielsen/Net Ratings.
This puts the organization in the ranks of such other highly visible on-line advertisers as the Microsoft Corporation and Amazon.com.
The council's increased visibility represents a gesture of good will on the part of Web publishers. But what does it say about the medium that so much advertising space is being given away?
"It's another indication that there's a ton of unsold inventory on the Web, as if we needed any more," said Jim Nail, an analyst who covers Internet advertising for Forrester Research in Cambridge, Mass.
Indeed, 40 percent to 70 percent of the ad space on even the most highly trafficked Web sites goes unsold, said Rich LeFurgy, chairman of the Internet Advertising Bureau, an industry trade organization. For what Mr. LeFurgy calls second- or third-tier sites, the proportion of unsold space is even higher.
One explanation for the unsold space is that the Web offers practically infinite publishing opportunities. Thus it has exponentially more advertising capacity than do television, radio and print media, which have limited space and air time.
Reluctant to have space allotted for advertising appear empty -- the digital equivalent of dead air time in broadcast media -- Web sites often plug in ads promoting their own services to take up the space. But a site can use just so many of those ads without looking tired.
"So why not plug in some public service, be a good guy?" Mr. Nail suggested as the reason for the widespread use of the public-service banners. "When people see that, they say, 'Hey, this site is good.' "
Besides perceiving that the Web site at hand has a social conscience, the public is also exposed to messages intended to improve society and public safety and to promote the nonprofit groups that advocate these causes.
The spirit of mobilizing communities is what propelled the advertising industry to create the War Advertising Council 57 years ago. Then, the group's focus was to rally the nation in support of World War II. One of its first initiatives was a campaign featuring Rosie the Riveter, the character that motivated women to enter the work force during the war. Now, the organization is known as both the Advertising Council and the Ad Council.
In 1997, the council added an on-line component to its public service campaigns. The banners are created by advertising agencies that volunteer staff time, and are available on the council's Web site (http:// www.adcouncil.org) to anyone who wishes to display them.
Peggy Conlon, president of the Ad Council, likens the increasing use of council banners on line to the early days of television, when public-service commercials helped fill air time.
"The more stations that went on the air, and the more hours they programmed, the more space there was to fill," she said. "We're being brought along on the Internet by the phenomenal growth of the industry."
Over the years, the council has grown significantly: in 1998, the group received $1.2 billion in donated space from all media. Donated space on the Internet soared from $5 million in 1997, based on cost estimates given the council by the contributing sites, to $28 million in 1998. That makes the medium an even bigger supporter of public-service campaigns than newspapers, which contributed $21.2 million in space in 1998. Even so, the sacrifice is a bit different: Web publishers have a lot of unsold space to give away, while traditional media companies often donate space they could have used for paid advertising.
Last year, the National Crime Prevention Council was the top-ranked media campaign for the Ad Council, receiving $128.1 million in donated media space. Jacqueline Aker, media director for the National Crime Prevention Council, said the Internet played an important role in helping her organization achieve its mission of educating the public about crime prevention, with 5,000 people a day visiting its Web site.
An anti-crime campaign aimed at teen-agers has received what Ms. Aker described as exceptional placement on line because many teen-age-theme Web sites are wary of accepting excessive paid advertising.
"Some sites like the Cartoon Network use our banners all the time," she said. "The creative makes a big difference, too. Our banners are really cool." They were fashioned by Saatchi & Saatchi, along with its interactive agency Darwin Digital, both of which are New York units of Saatchi & Saatchi P.L.C.
For all the good that such public-service advertisements do, some people still suggest that the incredible reach the Ad Council has achieved is a sign of a sluggish climate for advertisers on the Web. Wenda Millard, a council board member who is executive vice president of the on-line advertising network Doubleclick Inc., called that view cynical.
"Not all inventory on the Internet is going to be valued by advertisers," she said. "Some of the top sites may be top sites based on traffic, but it might not all be desirable space. I think it's very natural that you'll have tons of open space. The barriers to entry for the Web are so phenomenally low that literally your grandmother can create a Web site."
And if Grandma wants to put a public-service ad for the council-created character Smokey Bear on it, all the better.

Medicare Changes Would Bolster Prescription Management Services

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR 

DATELINE: ST. LOUIS

 BODY:
Barrett Toan calls himself a silent partner in the health care system. And if President Clinton has his way, there will be many more like him.
Mr. Toan is the president of Express Scripts Inc., which supervises the filling of 295 million prescriptions a year for 47 million people with private health insurance. In calling for Medicare coverage of prescription drugs, Mr. Clinton wants to see Express Scripts and similar companies play the same role for 39 million older Americans and disabled people. 
 While such companies, known as pharmacy benefit managers, have been popular for a decade or so, most consumers have only a vague idea of the powerful force they exert over which drugs are sold and which pharmacies sell them.
With the plastic identification cards issued by Express Scripts and similar companies, a patient can walk into a pharmacy, hand over $10 and walk out with $70 worth of medicine. The pharmacy benefit manager negotiates the complex arrangements behind that transaction.
Mr. Clinton would give such companies a great new responsibility, managing drug benefits for Medicare patients, who use a third of all drugs prescribed in the United States. But that shift would also illuminate some practices that have largely escaped public notice, including the power of pharmacy benefit managers to affect doctors' decisions and their dealings with drug companies. The arrangements, which include rebates from the drug companies to the managers for giving preference to certain drugs, would become much more visible.
Pharmacy benefit managers organize the market for prescription drugs, securing deep discounts from drug manufacturers and retail pharmacies for large employers or health plans. They try to influence doctors' prescribing habits and encourage the use of lower-cost drugs, including generic substitutes for brand-name medicines. They strongly recommend certain drugs over others in each therapeutic category -- antihistamines and treatments for high cholesterol or high blood pressure, for example.
In some ways, pharmacy benefit managers are like health maintenance organizations: they try to control the cost of care. So far, they have not engendered widespread hostility among consumers, as some H.M.O.'s have.
"We think we could play a useful role in Medicare," Mr. Toan said in an interview at his headquarters here. "We help consumers get the maximum value for the dollars they spend on pharmaceuticals. Many elderly patients are paying prices 20 to 25 percent higher than what our customers pay because they don't get the type of discounts we can negotiate."
But doctors and pharmacists are concerned about the market power of pharmacy benefit managers. While Express Scripts is independently owned, some of its chief competitors are owned by drug companies and drugstores.
"Our offices are besieged with faxes and phone calls urging us to change the drugs we prescribe for patients," said Dr. Raymond Scalettar, a Washington rheumatologist. "It's very troubling, very intrusive, and not necessarily in the patients' best interest."
Some people are equally troubled by the practice of drug manufacturers' giving cash rebates to the pharmacy benefit managers in return for having their products included on the list of preferred drugs. Pharmacists worry that some drugs may be chosen more for their rebates than for their efficacy. The terms of rebate agreements are considered proprietary information and are a carefully guarded secret.
Such concerns would grow if these companies managed drug benefits for Medicare recipients.
The President's plan to cover prescription drugs is part of his proposal to reorganize Medicare to make it more competitive and financially secure as members of the baby boom generation approach retirement age. Administration officials see pharmacy benefit managers as a way to prevent explosive growth in the cost of Medicare drug benefits without resorting to Federal price controls, which are anathema to drug makers.
Gene Sperling, the President's chief economic adviser, who helped design Mr. Clinton's Medicare proposal, said, "There are no price controls in this."
Rather, Mr. Sperling said, the Government would simply get "reasonable discounts," like other health plans that buy large quantities of drugs.
Nationwide, pharmacy benefit managers handled 1.8 billion prescriptions last year. Employers, labor unions and private health plans have increasingly turned to such companies to control drug spending, which has grown much faster than other health spending in recent years.
A study by the General Accounting Office, an investigative arm of Congress, found that pharmacy benefit managers had reduced the cost of drug benefits for Federal employees by 20 percent to 27 percent.
Drug benefit managers develop networks of retail pharmacies that may include thousands of drugstores. In return for a large volume of business, the drugstores must give discounts. Under a typical arrangement, a drugstore receives the average wholesale price for a drug, minus 15 percent. The pharmacist also gets a small dispensing fee, perhaps $2 for each prescription.
Elderly people often pay the highest prices for prescription drugs because their purchasing power is fragmented. Under Mr. Clinton's proposal, the Government would hire a private company in each region of the country to manage drug benefits for the large numbers of Medicare patients who are still in the traditional fee-for-service program.
Howard J. Bedlin, vice president of the National Council on the Aging, a research and advocacy group, said, "There's an emerging consensus that pharmacy benefit managers have an important role to play in Medicare reform, but you have to build in certain consumer protections" to guarantee the confidentiality of patients' records and to inform consumers of any restrictions on their choice of drugs.
Express Scripts, like other pharmacy benefit managers, reviews prescriptions before they are filled at retail drugstores across the country. The pharmacies file claims electronically. Express Scripts can immediately tell the pharmacist if the customer has insurance and how much of a co-payment to charge.
In addition, Express Scripts has records of other drugs that a patient has bought. This allows it to tell the pharmacist if the new drug would duplicate an existing prescription, if it could cause harmful interactions with other drugs or if a prescription is being refilled too early. The company at this point could also notify the pharmacist if another drug or a generic is preferred.
While employers and H.M.O.'s praise the work of drug benefit managers, many doctors and pharmacists have had frustrating experiences.
Edward F. Dillon, co-owner of Grubb's Pharmacy, a century-old store on Capitol Hill in Washington, said he understood the need to hold down health costs but had been exasperated by the techniques of pharmacy benefit managers.
"In some cases," Mr. Dillon said, "you have a college-age customer service representative calling a doctor with 30 years of experience and asking, 'What is your medical justification for this drug?' "
John M. Rector, general counsel of the National Community Pharmacists Association, which represents 35,000 independent pharmacies, said the preferences for certain drugs were often based on "back-room deals that the consumer never knows about."
For example, Mr. Rector said, a pharmacy benefit manager "sometimes tells the pharmacist to dispense a more expensive, inappropriate brand-name drug because the P.B.M. is getting a rebate or kickback from the manufacturer."
But Mr. Toan said most of the money from cash rebates was passed on to the sponsor of a health plan, reducing the overall cost of drug benefits for patients.
Mr. Toan, a former director of the Missouri Social Services Department, said Express Scripts was "the nation's largest independent pharmacy benefit manager." PCS Health Systems of Scottsdale, Ariz., another benefit manager, has been owned since January by Rite Aid, the drugstore chain. Their biggest competitor, Merck-Medco Managed Care, is owned by Merck & Company, the drug manufacturer.
Express Scripts manages $10 billion a year in drug spending for its clients, which include Bethlehem Steel and Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Missouri.
Stuart L. Bascomb, executive vice president of Express Scripts, said some drugs would not be affordable for many people without the discounts obtained by pharmacy benefit managers. The average retail prescription price of common cholesterol-lowering drugs, for example, is $100 a month, or $1,200 a year.
In one respect, Medicare is different from other clients of Express Scripts. Mr. Toan refused to give details of its contracts with drug manufacturers and pharmacies. But Congress and the public would probably insist on knowing the details of any discounts negotiated on behalf of Medicare patients.
The Comptroller General of the United States would want to audit Medicare's drug spending. Medicare officials would be tempted to regulate the activities of pharmacy benefit managers to protect Medicare patients and to save taxpayers' money. And pharmacists would demand an explanation if they were excluded from the list of drugstores serving Medicare beneficiaries in a particular region.
Even with the best efforts of drug benefit managers, Mr. Toan said, "Medicare, like commercial health plans, would probably face double-digit increases in drug costs, in the range of 15 percent a year."
Under Mr. Clinton's proposal, beneficiaries would have to pay half of any drug costs covered by Medicare.
"That would serve as a check against unnecessary use of medicines," Mr. Toan said. On the other hand, he said, "a lot of new medicines will address conditions of the elderly, and that might keep up a fairly steep increase in drug spending."
Independent pharmacists complain that they have little opportunity to negotiate with pharmacy benefit managers because contracts are offered to them on a "take it or leave it" basis. They say payments are so low that they often lose $5 or more on a $50 prescription.
In response, Mr. Toan said, "That's our job, to seek the lowest price we can get for our customers."

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS;
Malaysia Pushes Flagging Plan for Its Own Silicon Valley

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER 

DATELINE: CYBERJAYA, Malaysia, July 10

 BODY:
When 25 senior executives from technology companies around the world gathered here this week to tour Malaysia's Multimedia Super Corridor project, it had all the appearance of a somewhat dutiful pep rally for a technology-friendly Southeast Asian leader.
The meeting, however, was far from routine -- either in its lush tropical setting or in the object of the corporate kudos: Mahathir Mohamad. 
 Dr. Mahathir, the Prime Minister of Malaysia, has been engaged in the fight of his life over the last year. As the Asian economic crisis tore through this normally tranquil country, Dr. Mahathir, 73, imposed widely criticized controls on Malaysia's capital markets, vilified foreigners for causing Asia's misery, and imprisoned his popular former deputy, Anwar Ibrahim.
Many people here feared that the furor would doom Dr. Mahathir's ambitious vision to make Malaysia the technology lodestar of Asia. The Prime Minister's actions baffled some members of the panel of foreign executives that advises him on his flagship project, the Multimedia Super Corridor. The project, which was started in 1996, officially opened Thursday and is expected to take two decades to complete.
If the three-day meeting in honor of the opening did not quite dispel the manyfears, it provided a much-needed psychic boost.
"I am very pleasantly surprised by the amount of progress, frankly, that has been achieved," said Lewis Platt, the chairman of Hewlett-Packard and one of the executives on the advisory panel. Mr. Platt said he had heard a stream of bad news about Malaysia and the Super Corridor.
Dr. Mahathir's grand plan to carve an Asian Silicon Valley out of vast palm-oil plantations here is not dead -- though it is not thriving either. While Malaysia has signed up 228 companies to invest in the Super Corridor, only 9 have moved into the 270-square-mile swath of land between Kuala Lumpur and its futuristic airport. Just one, the accounting firm Arthur Andersen, is American.
Despite the upbeat remarks of Mr. Platt and other executives, most major foreign companies are still guarded about their commitments. The slow pace of investment has forced Malaysia to roll back its plans.
"When you plan for X number of dollars, and your economy suddenly shrinks by 6 percent, you have to scale things back," said Mohamed Arif Nun, the head of operations at the Multimedia Development Corporation, which runs the venture. "But it has not destroyed the integrity of the project."
Indeed, now that Malaysia has settled down a bit, Dr. Mahathir seems determined to get things back on track. In a ceremony inaugurating Cyberjaya, the new city that will be the heart of the Super Corridor, the Prime Minister reminded his visitors that they had 12 months to move their operations into the area -- or lose a package of tax exemptions and other incentives.
A handful of companies are here now. N.T.T., the Japanese telephone giant, just opened a research center, while Alcatel, the French telecommunications equipment maker, announced plans to open an operation with 40 engineers. But the big American players -- Hewlett-Packard, I.B.M., Microsoft and Sun Microsystems among others -- have yet to break ground or even rent office space.
Jaya is a Malay word meaning success, and Cyberjaya's planners confidently predict that it will someday be home to 240,000 people. For now, it feels like an ultra-modern ghost town. Roads and bridges crisscross land that used to be covered by palm trees, while fiber optic cable snakes underground.
There is even a new Multimedia University to serve, Stanford-style, as an academic hothouse for the community. The school, which opened in May, has 2,600 students and will eventually enroll 15,000.
Executives here acknowledged that last year's spate of troubles made the Multimedia Super Corridor a tough sell. Zasmida Abu Samah, the manager of sales and marketing for Cyberjaya's real estate developer, said it was difficult to lure new tenants between January 1998 and last fall.
"Last year was very hard," she said. "After January 1998, it was dead silence. We couldn't get people to call us."
Ms. Zasmida said companies began expressing interest again after Malaysia was host for the annual meeting of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation forum last November. Although the meeting was rocked by a speech in which Vice President Al Gore rebuked Malaysia for its suppression of freedoms, it did not generate violent street protests, as some had predicted.
"The political situation is something we pay close attention to," said Frank Smith, a partner at Ernst & Young in Singapore. "But it hasn't been a particularly destabilizing influence on our business."
Ernst & Young, the accounting and consulting firm, had proposed to build a regional technology center in Cyberjaya. Although the firm is revising the plan, Mr. Smith said it still planned to move operations here. "We just didn't do it as fast as we planned," he said.
Dr. Mahathir's decision to impose controls on Malaysia's capital markets last fall was a bigger cause for concern. The move, which he said was necessary to stabilize Malaysia's currency, the ringgit, drew harsh criticism. The Prime Minister worsened matters with outbursts against foreign currency traders.
During talks with the executives, Dr. Mahathir was questioned about the policy, according to a panel member. "He said, 'all we did was fix the currency.' " said the panel member. "But he acknowledged he may have been precipitate in his comments." Even if Malaysia can lay all fears to rest, it still faces formidable rivals. Singapore and Hong Kong are both building multi-billion-dollar technology parks -- seizing on high technology as a ticket out of their own doldrums.
Perhaps hedging its bets, the Multimedia Development Corporation announced plans to build a film studio and theme park in Cyberjaya -- marrying Silicon Valley with Hollywood, according to its proponents.
Some of the visitors said the all-encompassing nature of the Multimedia Super Corridor could give it an edge. With plans for schools, apartments, even golf courses, Cyberjaya is no mere office park.
"Most of these other countries are building technology parks to incubate small companies, which is fine," said John Gage, the chief researcher at Sun Microsystems. "But Malaysia thinks very, very differently."
As he puts a tumultuous year behind him, Dr. Mahathir must now hope that the world will come to share his vaulting vision.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS;
Dow Creeps to New Record; Other Gauges Are Mixed

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN 

 BODY:
Stocks were narrowly mixed on light volume yesterday, although the Dow Jones industrial average did edge up to a record. The struggle in the stock market came despite a big day in the bond market, where long-term interest rates fell sharply, with the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond ending at 5.90 percent.
Traders said bonds benefited from a big slide in the Argentine and Brazilian stock markets. Money flowing out of those markets may well have sought safe haven in the United States Treasury market, they said. 
 Any improvement in interest rates, however, will be short-lived if reports on producer and consumer prices scheduled for this week are viewed unfavorably.
"The producer price data will be an important determinant in whether bond yields relax further or are pushed back up," said Thomas M. Galvin, chief investment strategist at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette.
The inflation reports, as well as a heavy schedule of corporate earnings reports expected this week, caused many stock traders to stay on the sidelines.
"The concern is about earnings, and whether or not expectations, which are high, will be exceeded," said William Meehan, chief market analyst at Cantor Fitzgerald. "Many stocks, especially technology shares, have had huge moves in advance of these reports. Unless a company really blows past the estimates, I expect we might see some profit taking when the numbers are announced."
Helped by a gain of 1 3/4, to 53 1/2, in International Paper, which is scheduled to release its second-quarter earnings today, the Dow rose 7.28, to 11,200.98, although broader market measures slipped.
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index was down 4.18 points at 1,399.10. Declines in General Electric and America Online more than offset gains in technology issues like Lucent Technologies, Microsoft and MCI Worldcom.
The Nasdaq composite index fell 2.63 points, to 2,790.44. Big declines in Internet stocks like Yahoo and Amazon.com pulled the index down.
Small stocks, however, had a decent day. The Russell 2000 index of small-company shares rose 1.32 points, to 459.30.
Volume was sluggish, at 668.8 million shares on the New York Stock Exchange and 970.9 million shares on the Nasdaq.
Mr. Galvin of Donaldson, Lufkin said that a report expected from Intel after the market closes today would say a great deal about how technology shares might fare in the second half of the year. In addition to releasing financial data for the second quarter, Intel is expected to provide an outlook on the next six months.
"If Intel says Y2k is not an issue, that will clearly be a positive" for the market, Mr. Galvin said, referring to concerns about the Year 2000 computer problems. Shares of Intel slipped 13/16 yesterday, to 65 7/16.
Shares of Amgen Inc., the world's largest biotechnology company, fell 3, to 66 5/16, but were at $72.25 in after-hours trading on the Nasdaq. On Friday, citing "unusual" trading in its stock, the company said it would report second-quarter results after the market closed yesterday, about 10 days ahead of schedule. Profits rose 24 percent, to $268 million, or 50 cents a share in the quarter, surpassing both the 41 cents a share earned a year earlier and Wall Street expectations of 46 cents a share.
Eastman Kodak, a Dow component, gained 1 11/16, to 72 13/16.

HEADLINE: The Quill Holds the Power: Moscow's Media Wars

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINES 

DATELINE: MOSCOW, July 12

 BODY:
Someone not familiar with the average Russian's bent for intrigue might find it strange that one of Moscow's most influential newspapers was sold last week to an offshore investment fund run by two Iranians from a nearly empty Manhattan office.
But a lot is going on with the raucous press these days, much of it unsettling, and Russians who have been fitting the pieces together do not find such a sale strange at all. They suspect that the Iranians are a front for one power broker or another. An election campaign is beginning, and everyone with power, from business moguls to the Government, is angling to influence the outcome. 
 Influence has sometimes been a synonym for money, but the consensus this year is that the press -- or perhaps the faction that has the most control over it -- will play a crucial role in choosing who will lead Russia. The nation will elect a lower house of Parliament this winter and a successor to President Boris N. Yeltsin next summer.
The reason, analysts say, dates to early 1996, when a deeply unpopular Mr. Yeltsin appeared destined to lose his re-election campaign until Russia's information outlets rallied behind him -- and helped pull off a spectacular comeback victory.
"For everybody involved in this election, l996 proved that control of the media -- the support of the media -- is crucial in Russia," said Floriana Fossato, a correspondent and expert on the Russian press for Radio Free Europe in Moscow, "in fact, particularly in Russia."
The chief difference this time, of course, is that the press is not about to unite behind Mr. Yeltsin or his favored candidate. The solidarity of 1996 sprang from fears that a Communist victory would end capitalist reforms and lead to the closing of opposition newspapers and television stations.
Today Mr. Yeltsin is even more unpopular, but his likeliest successors, by and large, are democrats, if not always capitalists. Few worry these days about either a Communist victory or a serious crackdown on newspapers or broadcast outlets.
That is not quite the same as saying the Russian press is free. Moscow has at least 15 dailies of note and dozens of weeklies. They flaunt a range of opinion that makes American newspapers look pinched, and rarely a day goes by without the flaying of some hapless official or business power.
But most papers and magazines remain tools of their owners, who are not squeamish about ordering up stories to suit their views.
More than once, feuds among oligarchs and officials have been played out in the press. The most spectacular example occurred this spring, when an inquiry by Russia's prosecutor general into high-level corruption was sidetracked by a videotape on state-controlled television showing a man strongly resembling him in bed with two women.
Given that sort of power, it was not at all surprising that someone decided to snap up Kommersant, a business-oriented daily that is said to be millions of dollars in the red. It does not circulate widely outside Moscow, but its reputation for independence and accuracy has given it influence well beyond its circulation.
The newspaper's buyers, two 30-ish unknowns, paid perhaps $20 million for an 85 percent stake. Although the new owners vigorously deny it, few in Moscow believe that they are anything more than fronts for someone seeking an extended reach in anticipation of a new Government. It is unclear, though, why the buyer would want to be secretive about it.
The denials about the buyers' intention have not gained credibility from the disclosure that the remaining 15 percent stake was bought by Boris Berezovsky, the most ambitious of Russia's business leaders.
"There's no doubt that these events are directly connected with the elections," said Misha Berger, the editor of the respected daily Segodnya. "Kommersant is the act of a group of private investors or politicians in Russia. Maybe it was a contest between Berezovsky and Chubais."
He was referring to Anatoly Chubais, once Mr. Yeltsin's chief economic adviser, now the chairman of the electricity monopoly and for years an enemy of Mr. Berezovsky.
Mr. Chubais, who remains a backstage adviser to Mr. Yeltsin, was widely reported to be seeking control of Kommersant with the help of a Moscow bank.
It would take a small book to describe all the political jockeying among the media barons. But any report would begin with Mr. Berezovsky, an arch-capitalist and onetime Yeltsin ally whose relations with the Kremlin are strained.
More than anyone, Mr. Berezovsky has been beefing up his holdings. He is already the principal force at the Moscow newspaper Nezavisimaya Gazeta and at Russian Public Television, a nationwide network that is 51 percent state-owned. And he bought control this spring of TV6, a popular Moscow station hit hard by last year's fiscal collapse.
He said at a news conference last month that his holdings would work to promote liberal economic reforms and to restrain the Communist Party. Some analysts believe he plans a campaign to try to end Communist control of the lower house.
Mr. Berezovsky's purchase angered Mayor Yuri Luzhkov of Moscow. Through city entities, the Mayor controls a small stake in TV6, a share of a Moscow newspaper, a major publishing house and two-thirds of Center TV, a channel whose content might best be termed all-Luzhkov, all the time.
Mr. Luzhkov, an early contender for president and a political enemy of Mr. Berezovsky, complained that TV6 would not cover him fairly if Mr. Berezovsky owned it.
For sheer ambition, however, neither man is likely to match the Russian Government, which experts say has been conspicuously busy fine-tuning its huge information machine.
Late last month the country's second state-controlled television network, RTR, abruptly canceled a popular long-running program, "Top Secret," which specialized in political muckraking, sometimes aimed at the Government itself.
Network officials said the program had descended into "kompromat," roughly translated as mudslinging. Program executives responded that it was RTR that had broadcast the video that seemed to show the prosecutor and the women.
About the same time, Igor Shabdurasulov, the general director of the largest state-owned television network, ORT, told a convention of Russian journalists his views on the campaign: "We will determine for ourselves which political parties and movements correspond to our political understanding."
The Government owns 100 of Russia's 550 television stations and 18 percent of the 12,000 registered newspapers and magazines, said Kim Iskyan, an analyst with MFK Renaissance, a major investment bank in Moscow.
"With the overwhelming majority of broadcasters and print media outlets controlled by groups that have political power as their ultimate aim (including the Government itself), the media has come to be a means to the end of power, rather an end in and of itself," Mr. Iskyan wrote in his latest analysis.
And it is used with great effectiveness. After Russia's lower house approved the nomination of Sergei V. Stepashin as Prime Minister this spring, state-controlled television suddenly broadcast a stream of advertisements promoting the candidacy of Vladimir Zhirinovsky, a right-wing nationalist leader, for governor of Belgorod region. Most analysts assume the ads were a thank-you for Mr. Zhirinovsky's delivery of his followers' votes to Mr. Stepashin.
Last week Mr. Yeltsin signed a decree combining all press functions, from issuing broadcast licenses to overseeing communications satellites to forming media policy, into a single Cabinet agency headed by a state television official, Mikhail Lesin, one of Mr. Yeltsin's top image-makers.
Prime Minister Stepashin rejected expressions of concern that the Government was forming a propaganda ministry, but he allowed that the agency would "consolidate all the state's capabilities in -- pardon the old-fashioned word -- 'ideological work.' "
In an interview on Friday, Mr. Yeltsin's spokesman, Dmitri Yakushkin, said the ministry was an old idea that Mr. Stepashin had decided to carry out and that its functions would be mainly technical.
Russian journalists note that the new ministry will have potentially sweeping powers to revoke broadcasting licenses and even to pressure newspapers, and they expressed the hope that Mr. Stepashin is simply guilty of infelicitous phrasing stemming from his years working on internal security.
They take heart that Mr. Yeltsin has repeatedly insisted that the press be unfettered, even as it attacked him. At the same time, they are unnerved by his mercurial personality and by nagging reports that he is reluctant to cede power.
"I don't think we have to exaggerate the meaning of these events, but we can't ignore them either," said Mr. Berger, the editor. "During the last year, Yeltsin has been an even stronger advocate of freedom of the press. But maybe something changed. We hope it didn't, but it can."

HEADLINE: D'Amato Trying to Settle Cipriani-Union War

BYLINE: By CHARLES V. BAGLI 

 BODY:
Former Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato, never known for delicate diplomatic skills while in office, is now trying to settle the bitter and protracted war between the restaurant workers union and the Cipriani family over the landmark Rainbow Room and some of the city's most expensive restaurants and catering halls.
But the restaurant war, which has forced celebrities like Leonardo DiCaprio, Julia Roberts and Arthur Miller to take sides, may turn out to be a particularly tough challenge for Mr. D'Amato, now a consultant and lobbyist. 
 Even as the union established a daily picket line outside the Rainbow Room and the Ciprianis tried to toss the union out of its flagship restaurant on Fifth Avenue in the spring, Mr. D'Amato shuttled between the two sides trying to bring an end to the conflict. But the battling only seemed to intensify.
The restaurant family lost tens of thousands of dollars when the union persuaded General Motors, George magazine, HBO and many others to cancel their events at Cipriani 42d Street, the family's catering hall, according to court papers. In May, the Ciprianis sued the union and filed for bankruptcy protection for Harry Cipriani, its chic and profitable restaurant in the Sherry-Netherland Hotel.
"In the past eight months, the union has been trying to put pressure on Harry Cipriani in order to get some positive results at the Rainbow Room," said Giuseppe Cipriani, who runs the family's New York operations. "That's why I put the company into Chapter 11."
But in bankruptcy court last week, both sides discussed asking the court to formally appoint Mr. D'Amato as the mediator in the conflict. Mr. D'Amato, the Senator who excoriated President Clinton for years, took on the Swiss Government on behalf of Holocaust survivors and sang schoolyard ditties on the Senate floor, said, well, maybe.
"There are some contentious issues," Mr. D'Amato said yesterday. "There are tough-minded people on both sides. If I can facilitate an end to the hostilities, I'd like to do it. But there has to be a zone in which a settlement is possible. If that exists, I would formally agree to become involved."
Mr. D'Amato, who has advised the Cipriani family in the past and knew some of the union leaders, said he would not take money for his efforts. "It's really a labor of love," he said. "It's not for economic reasons."
The war began last December when the Cipriani family took over management of the Rainbow Room at Rockefeller Center and fired the 250 workers who were represented by Local 6 of the Hotel Employees and Restaurant Employees Union. The union vowed to fight and immediately set up a picket line. The war spread to the Ciprianis' newly opened catering hall on 42d Street and to Harry Cipriani, where the union had represented workers since 1992.
Mr. Cipriani refused to compromise, saying the union was killing his business, although Harry Cipriani is regarded by many people in the industry as one of the most profitable restaurants in the city.
At the urging of both sides, Mr. D'Amato got involved in May, and though the first meeting appeared to go well, Mr. Cipriani did not return to the bargaining table, according to two people who were involved in negotiations.
In a move that does not bode well for Mr. D'Amato's efforts, Mr. Cipriani offered to sign a union contract at the Rainbow Room if the union would agree to slash the wages and benefits of workers at Harry Cipriani in half, said Peter Ward, president of the Hotel Trades Council. After Mr. Ward refused the offer, Mr. Cipriani flew to Washington last week in an unsuccessful attempt to win over the national union.
"He's asking the union to give him a gigantic subsidy at the restaurant he owns exclusively, in return for a union contract at the Rainbow Room, which is owned by him and his investors," Mr. Ward said. "So he's holding his investors' interests hostage to his own. It's just not going to happen."
Meanwhile, Mr. DiCaprio and the film director Martin Scorsese decided to move their benefit for the Film Foundation to another location rather than cross a picket line to get into Cipriani 42d Street. "Leonardo DiCaprio feels strongly about picket lines and the rights of workers," said Ken Sunshine, a spokesman for the actor.
Ms. Roberts and Mr. Miller crossed pickets lines at the catering hall for events in May.
The union has been busy on other fronts as well. In response to complaints by the union and others, the city's Department of Consumer Affairs is investigating whether the Ciprianis should have a license to operate the catering hall. Consumer Affairs recently cited Mr. Cipriani for failing to obtain a license for a sidewalk cafe at his SoHo restaurant, Downtown, at 376 West Broadway.
Last week, both sides decided to give Mr. D'Amato one more try.
"At every war there is a beginning and an end," Mr. Cipriani said. "We are looking forward to the end."

HEADLINE: Credit Card Scheme Tied to Car Rentals

BYLINE: By VIVIAN S. TOY 

 BODY:
One thing that hundreds of people who fell victim to an elaborate credit card scheme had in common was that they had all rented a car from the Thrifty car rental agency in Warwick, R.I., over the last three years, officials said.
The other thing they had in common was that a former employee at the agency was accused of selling copies of their rental car agreements for $20 apiece to a group of Nigerian immigrants in New York who used the information to steal $1.4 million, according to prosecutors from the Queens District Attorney's office. 
 The immigrants used information from the rental agreements to dig for more data in computer banks to call banks and transfer money from the victims' credit card accounts into bank accounts that they had opened under false identities, prosecutors said.
Nine Nigerian immigrants were arraigned yesterday in the credit card scheme, which was also linked to a broad range of other crimes, including tax fraud, forgery of drivers' licenses and Social Security cards to help illegal immigrants obtain employment, and dealing in drugs. All nine pleaded not guilty to the charges, which were handed up in a 268-count indictment.
The Queens District Attorney, Richard A. Brown, said 1,300 people from 21 states had had their credit identities stolen by the ring since early 1996. Law enforcement officials traced the illegal wire transfers, ranging from $600 to $44,000 and said most of the stolen money was sent back to Nigeria.
The former Thrifty employee, who was not identified, was also accused of selling rental car agreements in Chicago and Missouri but has not yet been charged in the case.
Mr. Brown said that although the banks that issued the credit cards eventually covered the losses, "the victims still suffered immeasurably because of the loss of their credit ratings and of their good names." He added that consumers ultimately wound up paying for this kind of fraud through high interest rates.
He said the rental agreements included the driver's license number of the renter, which in some states is the same as a Social Security number. The suspects are said to have used the Social Security numbers to obtain copies of birth certificates, which gave mothers' maiden names, the password that many banks use to authorize money transfers.
Both Mr. Brown and Police Commissioner Howard Safir called for changes in the banking industry to make it harder to transfer large sums of money by phone. They said law enforcement efforts were handicapped by the fact that banks seldom report this type of fraud and instead assume it as a cost of doing business.
"It's incomprehensible to me that banks would transfer large amounts of money out of an account based simply on a telephone call without any significant means of identification," Mr. Brown said.
Mr. Safir said a major hurdle in prosecuting this kind of credit card fraud was that neither victims nor banks readily reported the crime. "People are not rushing forward to report it because the credit card companies tell them they're not liable for it," he said. "So banks need to rush forward and report this, but they don't."
Mr. Brown said banks often made it easy to transfer money electronically to attract more customers. "They figure if one of 100 transactions is fraudulent, then that's the cost of doing business," he said.
Most of the illegal transactions in the current case, worth $1.1 million, were authorized by MBNA-America, a bank based in Wilmington, Del. Other financial institutions lost between $21,000 and $64,000.
Brian Dalphon, a spokesman for MBNA, with 40 million customers worldwide, said he believed that it was just coincidence that the bulk of the illegal transfers came out of MBNA accounts. "Our fraud losses are actually among the lowest in the industry," he said. "This particular scheme was brand-new. It was something we hadn't seen before, and since then, we've put in controls so that it won't happen again." He would not elaborate on the new controls.
Prosecutors said the credit card scheme was uncovered while police officers were investigating suspected drug dealing in the Rockaways. Wiretaps later led officials from one drug suspect to other suspects linked to the credit card theft and forgery. Officials said they did not know whether all the suspects were legal immigrants or where in Nigeria they came from.
The three charged with selling $16,500 worth of heroin face up to life in prison if convicted and are being held without bail. They are Joseph Omesiete, 44, a security guard from Far Rockaway, Queens; Babatunde Shodunke, 34, a taxi driver from Rosedale, Queens, and Bola Adeola, 34, a security guard from Arverne, Queens. Mr. Adeola also has been charged in the credit card scheme.
Prosecutors said the credit card operation was organized by Ayodele Peters, 28, who they said ran it from his home in Canarsie, Brooklyn. He faces seven years in prison if convicted and was unable to post $60,000 in bail. His lawyer, David E. Levine, said, "He wouldn't be sitting in jail for $60,000 bond if he had $1 million he'd stolen from people."
Mr. Levine also represents Mr. Peters's wife, Yewande Elegbe Peters, who faces 25 years in prison if convicted in the scheme. Mr. Levine said Mrs. Peters, who worked as a State Health Department inspector, gave birth two weeks ago to twin boys two months prematurely. "The birth was brought on by the aggravation of this case," he said.
The four other suspects were released on bail and face between 7 and 15 years in prison if convicted. They are Derrick Roundtree, a 35-year-old accountant from Flatbush, Brooklyn; Olusola Ashaye, a 42-year-old security guard from Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn; Abiodun Oguntoyinbo, a 38-year-old security guard from Bedford-Stuyvesant, and Adebiyi Otulaja, a 37-year-old youth counselor from Arverne.
Chris Payne, a spokesman for Thrifty, said he had little information on the case. "We do recommend that our locations take the utmost care in handling this kind of information," he said, adding that many agencies use shredders to destroy the forms.

HEADLINE: Globalization Widens Rich-Poor Gap, U.N. Report Says

BYLINE: By JUDITH MILLER 

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, July 13

 BODY:
Globalization is compounding the gap between rich and poor nations and intensifying American dominance of the world's economic and cultural markets, according to the latest human development report published today by the United Nations Development Program.
The 262-page report, the 10th the program has issued, is the first to focus on the spread of the Internet and computer technology as well as the impact of globalization. It concludes that the so-called "rules of globalization" should be rewritten to save the 60 countries that are worse off they were in 1980 from falling even further behind. 
 While short on specific proposals for making international markets work "for people rather than profits," the report recommends, as have previous versions, faster debt relief, redirection of aid to the poorest countries and a task force to review "global governance." It also endorses a tax of one American cent on lengthy E-mails to raise $70 billion a year that could be used to connect the world's Internetless.
The report warns that the glaring, growing inequalities in the distribution of wealth pose a "dangerous polarization" between rich and poor countries.
As in previous reports, it says little about what role the poorest nations themselves play in their predicament. It says little about the corruption and mismanagement of resources in many of the poorest countries that have discouraged foreign investment and squandered millions of dollars in foreign aid.
The report highlights the dominant role of the United States, and as a result, of English -- the language of choice for 80 percent of web sites -- in the new global telecommunications marketplace. It notes that 26 percent of Americans use the World Wide Web -- as opposed to 3 percent of Russians, 4 one-hundredths of 1 percent of the population of South Asia and 2-10ths of 1 percent for Arab states. And it says that the United States has more computers than the rest of the world combined.
It also notes that the annual sales of General Motors are larger than the gross domestic products of Thailand or Norway, and that Ford generates more income than Saudi Arabia. America and the other rich, industrialized nations hold 97 percent of all worldwide patents, it says.
Moreover, the report says, the gap between globally well-connected and unconnected peoples is likely to grow even faster given the technology explosion. The number of Internet users today, 150 million, is expected to grow to 700 million by 2001. An American needs to save a month's salary to buy a computer; a Bangladeshi must save all his wages for eight years to do so.
Richard Jolly, a British economist and the report's main author, said the report is neither anti-American nor anti-free market. "The report specifically endorses markets as the best guarantee of efficiency," Mr. Jolly said, "but not necessary of equity."
America, he said, was among the first to appreciate the dangers of monopoly and, as such, to pass antitrust laws to dilute concentrations of economic power. The international community, he said, has yet to figure out how to deal with such global market concentrations.

HEADLINE: Second Agency Downgrades Nassau County Bonds Rating

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HALBFINGER 

 BODY:
MINEOLA, N.Y., July 12 -- A second major bond-rating agency today downgraded Nassau County's credit to near-junk status, prompting the county's budget director to accuse Democrats in Albany of blocking a bailout of Nassau "for partisan political reasons."
Despite a booming economy and one of the nation's wealthiest populations, Nassau is confronted with a budget deficit of more than $200 million after years of growth in spending that was not matched by tax increases. Its bonds were steeply downgraded by Standard & Poor's on June 29. Moody's Investors Service today lowered Nassau's rating to an equivalent level, Baa2, just two notches above junk, and threatened another downgrade if the county does not obtain new sources of revenue soon. 
 In announcing the downgrade, Moody's faulted Nassau for delays in obtaining state legislative approval for a new one percent tax on property sales. "It just doesn't seem like a great deal of progress is being made, or a significant amount of positive discussions are taking place between the county and the state," said Helen Cregger, of Moody's.
Assembly Democrats led by Thomas P. DiNapoli, of Great Neck, in Nassau County, last week demanded that the county give the State Comptroller, H. Carl McCall, a Democrat, extensive oversight powers in exchange for such a bailout.
In a statement released this evening, Michael Fabiano, the Nassau budget director, blamed Mr. DiNapoli and his colleagues for the latest downgrade. "The county has formulated a fiscal plan which addresses the issues raised by Moody's," Mr. Fabiano said. "Unfortunately, key elements of the plan, which require state legislative approval, have been blocked by Assembly Democrats for partisan political reasons. The action announced today by Moody's is not unexpected in view of the State Assembly's failure to act on the county's fiscal plan."
Told of Mr. Fabiano's statement, Mr. DiNapoli said, "Now's not the time for a blame game." But he quickly added that it was County Executive Thomas S. Gulotta, a Republican, who was guilty of inaction, for ignoring the Democrats's call for oversight by the Comptroller and other reforms. "We haven't heard back, except that they feel we're asking for too much," he said. "We give them a 20-page document, and they give a one-sentence response. They're just not dealing in reality."
In addition to lowering the rating on Nassau's $2.7 billion in long-term bonds, Moody's lowered Nassau's short-term credit rating from the highest to the second of three rating levels. Ms. Cregger said the lower rating would reduce the number of investors bidding for Nassau's short-term notes and increase the county's costs. The county expects to borrow a record $430 million in this way to pay its bills this year.
Moody's also said the county's plan to borrow against anticipated future income from its share of a nationwide tobacco settlement by the end of the year seemed "increasingly remote."

Cost of Drink Recall Rises For Coca-Cola's Bottler
Coca-Cola's bottler, Coca-Cola Enterprises, said that it would take a $103 million charge against second-quarter earnings to cover expenses associated with the recall of soft drinks in Europe last month, about 70 percent more than previously acknowledged. The charge erases second-quarter earnings for the bottler.
Coca-Cola Enterprises said two weeks ago that the recall involved 14 million cases of soft drinks and would cost the company $60 million. But that number ballooned after 17 million cases of products were returned. Page C7.

HEADLINE: Tax-and-Spending Talks Begin in Earnest

BYLINE: By JOHN M. BRODER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 12

 BODY:
President Clinton and Republican leaders warily met today to discuss a broad array of tax and spending proposals that expose the deep divisions and distrust between the parties.
With Mr. Clinton back from a weeklong tour of impoverished areas and Congress returning to work after the Fourth of July recess, talks began in earnest in the Oval Office late this afternoon on matters of social policy and money that will drive negotiations in Washington through the fall budget-writing season, and probably well into the 2000 campaign. 
 Mr. Clinton invited the Senate majority leader, Trent Lott; the House majority leader, Dick Armey, and Speaker J. Dennis Hastert to the White House to discuss his plans for Medicare and Social Security and to hear Republican proposals for large tax cuts. The Democratic leaders of the Senate and House, Tom Daschle and Richard A. Gephardt, also attended the meeting.
The President told the Republican leaders that he was willing to work with them to use the bulk of projected Federal budget surpluses of $2.9 trillion over the next 10 years to insure the solvency of Social Security and Medicare, aides said after the meeting. But he repeated his view that Republican plans to cut taxes by $800 billion or more over the next decade would make it impossible to revamp Medicare or to add billions in new spending for education, the military and the environment.
Gene Sperling, the President's chief economic adviser, said the President expressed willingness to discuss tax cuts of a smaller magnitude, but only after dealing with what he views as more pressing priorities. Mr. Clinton has said he would be willing to devote about $250 billion of the estimated surplus over the next decade to tax breaks intended to spur retirement savings among low- and middle-income families.
While the atmosphere of the Oval Office meeting was described as friendly, Administration officials earlier in the day described the Republican tax-cutting plans as a "shell game" that threatened to undermine the economy, consume the estimated surpluses and put the Federal budget back into the red just as an encouraging scenario of surplus is about to begin.
Treasury Secretary Lawrence H. Summers called the tax cuts "potentially explosive" if projected surpluses fail to materialize. Mr. Sperling said the Republican proposals were "puzzling, disappointing and disturbing" because they leave nothing for the repair of Medicare.
The vehemence of the White House reaction this early in the process led Republicans to question the President's sincerity when he says he seeks to put partisanship aside and reach a compromise this year.
"I'm still trying to figure out if he really wants to get things done -- cooperate on Social Security, Medicare, taxes, even trade -- or is he going to go the partisan route," Mr. Lott said in an interview with The Associated Press. "I get different signals from him. Most indicate he's going for partisanship."
For all the money being put on the table by the surplus, reaching a deal will not be easy.
The debate over how to apportion the excess revenue is about more than numbers. Republicans support a big tax cut not just because it would give money back to voters, but because it would move the money out of Washington, and therefore help their efforts to reduce the size and influence of the Federal Government.
Administration officials said their intent was not to block a tax cut, but to insure continued financing of military, education, health and environmental programs, while pumping new money into Medicare and avoiding the risk of renewed budget deficits.
As a result, any compromise would be more complex than finding a number between $250 billion -- the amount Mr. Clinton says is appropriate for a tax cut over the next decade -- and $864 billion, the figure in the Republican tax legislation that will be taken up by the House Ways and Means Committee on Tuesday.
"It would be a mistake to think you just look at these numbers and somehow say, well, can you just split the difference?" said Jacob J. Lew, the White House budget director. "You have to ask, what do you want to get on defense, what do you want to get on Medicare, and you have to put first things first."
In the end, though, the most complicating factors may be the political judgments made by leaders of both parties about how a deal, or the lack of one, would play on the campaign trail in 2000.
There are factions within both parties that see an ideological showdown as the best way of turning out voters on their behalf next year. And there are both Democrats and Republicans who believe that they will do better by going to the voters with a record of accomplishment, even if it means compromise.
The calculations will be particularly tricky for the White House, where Mr. Clinton, Vice President Al Gore and Hillary Rodham Clinton all have different political imperatives.

HEADLINE: Doomed Domes of the 'Old' Diamonds

BYLINE: By SAM HOWE VERHOVEK 

DATELINE: SEATTLE, July 12

 BODY:
Seattle is about to say hello to Safeco Field, a brick-facade palace with cedar-lined dugouts, an exquisite turf of Kentucky bluegrass and ryegrass, and a retractable steel-rail canopy to insure that the game will go on, under the sky or shielded from the rain. At $517 million, the ball park, which opens on Thursday, is the most expensive in Major League Baseball history.
But the big welcome to (mostly) outdoor baseball here heralds an inglorious farewell to the hulking concrete mushroom next door known as the Kingdome, where the Mariners played indoors, on artificial turf, for 22 1/2 seasons. The dome is scheduled to be imploded next year, to make way for an open-air football stadium. 
 And in Houston, baseball is ditching the Astrodome, hailed as the Eighth Wonder of the World when it opened in 1965. The building, the country's first air-conditioned stadium, is being abandoned by the Astros next spring for a new downtown ball park that, like Seattle's, has a retractable roof. With football's Oilers having left for Nashville, the Astrodome's future is uncertain. Its major tenants now include the two-and-a-half-week Houston Livestock and Rodeo Show, an offshore-oil technology conference and assorted auto shows known as "dirt events," like the demolition derby and "Monster Truck Madness."
These are dark days for many of America's domed stadiums, which were once called technological marvels but, after barely a generation, are increasingly considered obsolete and antiseptic by fans and owners.
In several cases, in places that might be described as climatically challenged, owners have been able to entice or strong-arm their cities into adopting the vastly more expensive outdoor stadiums with retractable roofs and bolstered by the go-go economy of the 90's. That is fueled by the have-it-all philosophy that puts games outside on sunny days but brings them inside when the weather turns foul. These splashy convertible models are already in use in Toronto and Phoenix, and Milwaukee will open one next year.
Many other cities have already chosen gleaming new outdoor ball parks that hark back, in design and ambience, to the era of such venerable stadiums as Fenway Park in Boston, where the All-Star Game will be played on Tuesday night but whose own future the city is passionately debating.
And with the Minnesota Twins lobbying strongly for an outdoor ball park to get themselves out of the Metrodome, it is very likely that just one Major League Baseball team will be left playing inside a fixed-roof dome within a few years.
Even that team, the Tampa Bay Devil Rays, seems to be doing everything it possibly can to distract fans from the fact that they are stuck indoors watching a ball game. The stadium's name, the Thunderdome, was changed to Tropicana Field. The huge Diamondvision screen broadcasts live shots at night games of the sun setting over the nearby Gulf Coast. Palm trees are placed throughout, and in a section of the upper deck known as the beach, fans can order tropical drinks at a tiki bar or listen to island music.
The scenario is somewhat less bleak for domes as venues for professional football. Seven of the National Football League's 31 teams play indoors.
But not a single one has won a Super Bowl, a fact that is a source of endless speculation for fans (some say it is injuries from the artificial turf; others contend that the domed teams collapse when they have to face a team outdoors in January's playoffs), and nearly all new and proposed football stadiums, like the one here in Seattle, are of the open-air, real-grass variety.
And, for baseball at least, the verdict is clearly already in.
"There simply aren't any domes out there for baseball that people are excited about," said Andrew Zimbalist, an economics professor at Smith College who has written several books about the sports industry. "For football, there are at least some fans who like the fact that they don't get snowed on or get cold, and they never have to worry about the football hitting the ceiling."
But for baseball games, domes just aren't a hit. Perhaps even more important, said Professor Zimbalist, is that owners so far have been able to persuade cities and states to foot a hefty part of the bill for the fancy retractable models.
"Just a few years ago," Professor Zimbalist said, "a stadium would cost maybe $125 million. Now they're spending that just on the roof."
It is possible, of course, that cities will soon shun the convertibles, not necessarily for reasons of esthetics, but of cost. Seattle's new baseball Xanadu is a cautionary example: it is already roughly $100 million over budget, and the Mariners and local leaders are engaged in a bitter battle over who will pay that, putting something of a damper on Thursday's big opening, at which the Mariners will play the San Diego Padres.
But fans seem excited, and the new parks do hold out a best-of-all-worlds scenario: most of the time, they promise outdoor baseball under blue or night skies, but if the rain or cold or heat or humidity or even the mosquitoes come, the roof can slide in over the assembled heads in a matter of minutes.
And even though the Kingdome is a fixture of the skyline, few people seem to lament its passing. This is partly because it was never considered an object of beauty. Bob Wood, author of "Dodger Dogs to Fenway Franks" (McGraw-Hill, 1988), a book about baseball stadiums, called it "a festering pimple on one of America's loveliest urban faces."
Nor was the Kingdome, once described by Sports Illustrated as having "all the ambience of a port-a-john," ever seen as a fun place to watch a ball game. And it had its share of misfortunes. Heavy acoustic tiles once fell from the ceiling, nearly striking Cal Ripken Jr. of the visiting Orioles, who holds the record for most consecutive games played.
In Houston, feelings about the Astrodome seem to be a bit more complicated. Its opening was an event noted around the world and hailed by city leaders as one of the great human achievements of all time.
"Sparkling like a rare jewel on a one-time Houston swamp, the Astrodome is the Taj Mahal of all stadia from Rome's Colosseum on down to this day," exulted the 262-page book that celebrated the Astrodome's 1965 opening. The opening-day program read: "The searing Texas sun will still beat down, the angry Gulf winds will still howl, and the tropical rains will still fall, but not on the spectators in the Astrodome. They will sit in almost regal splendor."
The problem these days, of course, is that few people consider the air-conditioned, carpeted ambience of a fixed-dome stadium to be splendid at all. They prefer to watch a game outdoors -- unless, of course, it is too hot, or too cold, or too wet, which is where the retractable roofs come in.
The Kingdome is one of five Major League ball parks closing this year, and it is by far the youngest. With the Astrodome, the others are Detroit's Tiger Stadium, which opened in 1912, County Stadium in Milwaukee (1953) and the former Candlestick Park in San Francisco (1960).
With Safeco's cost cresting above the half-billion mark (the Kingdome cost $67 million, far less even adjusting for inflation), it is not clear whether municipalities will continue to finance convertible stadiums.
Many cities are not clamoring for them to begin with because their climates do not create a need for them, others have resisted any calls for new stadiums as primarily a ploy by owners for yet more lucrative luxury boxes. In New York, nearly every indoor, outdoor and both-ways iteration of new ball parks for the Yankees and the Mets has been discussed, including the possibility of a $1 billion, retractable-roof stadium on Manhattan's West Side, but the issue is far from resolved.
The Minnesota Twins now want to move outdoors but, at least at one point, their domed home, known as the Metrodome, was seen as a big factor in the team's success. In the 1987 World Series, the team lost all three games on the road, outdoors, to the St. Louis Cardinals, but won all four games in the dome, with deafening support from the home crowd, to win the championship.
In the main, fans in Seattle seem excited about the concept of outdoor baseball on real grass, although one nagging issue has come up.
What will it mean for the team's star slugger, Ken Griffey Jr., who hit more home runs than anyone else in the Kingdome (198), including, fittingly, the last one, in the Mariners' last game there on June 27?
Mr. Griffey, widely seen as the current player with perhaps the best chance of breaking Hank Aaron's all-time homer record of 755, could do less well in an outdoor park with damp air and other weather factors. Also, the distance down the line to right field, which he favors, is 326 feet, 14 feet longer than at the Kingdome. On the other hand, the new fence is shorter in some places.
The Mariners actually conducted a series of wind-tunnel tests and other measurements to try to calculate the new stadium's impact on their star's homer production. "But I don't think anyone will definitely know until we get out here and play ball," said Rebecca Hale, a team spokeswoman.
"I can tell you this, though," she said today at the stadium. "We've got a nice breeze going on right now. And it's blowing out."

Peanuts and Cracker Jack 1912-1964
Built around the World Wars, these antiques are great to look at and not so great to sit in anymore. Boston's Fenway Park, built in 1912, and Yankee Stadium, built in 1923, contain many memories and not enough bathrooms. And while the outfield walls of Wrigley Field, below (1914), are covered with ivy, those lovable losers, the Cubs, still play inside. (Associated Press)
 
No Sky and Fake Grass 1965 to 1982
The Houston Astrodome, built in 1965, where Mickey Mantle hit the first home run, was considered one of the great wonders of the world at the time, but now artificial surface is the bane of all baseball fans and players. Cookie-cutter stadiums were a politician's dream way to save money and house multiple sports, but fans eventually found them to be so similar as to be boring. Seen one, seen 'em all. (Associated Press)
 
The Revival Period 1992 to . . .
A backlash to the cookie cutters: architects and fans harked back to the days of Ebbets Field and the Polo Grounds. Baltimore's Camden Yards (above), opened in 1992, begins the ballpark renaissance that will continue with the opening of the ballparks of Detroit and Milwaukee in the next 12 months. (Associated Press)

HEADLINE: Revive Marriage To End Poverty?

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Heather Mac Donald's call to "revive marriage" to end poverty and protect poor children reverses cause and effect (letter, July 11). The "explosion of out-of-wedlock births" among black women closely parallels the decline in job opportunities for the black fathers of these children. 
 In New York, job losses took a high toll among young black men. Their rate of participation in the labor force fell by more than half between 1950 and 1980, and rose only slightly afterward. The thousands now in prison for drug dealing are exiles from a job market that largely excluded them and a school system that failed them.
William Julius Wilson's research in Chicago showed that black men born in the war years were two and a half times more likely to marry the mothers of their children than were those born a generation later. Behavior did not change, but the economy did.

HEADLINE: U.S. Lawsuit Faults Toyota On Pollution Warning Lights

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER 

DATELINE: DETROIT, July 12

 BODY:
The Federal Government sued Toyota today, accusing it of violating the Clean Air Act by selling 2.2 million automobiles on which the "check engine" light would not illuminate even when the vehicles were emitting excessive pollution.
The lawsuit, which theoretically could involve penalties of as much as $60 billion, came after Toyota rejected an offer to settle the case out of court. It is the latest in a series of similar disputes pitting the Government against auto makers and truck makers. In each case, the Government has contended that the vehicles' computer diagnostic equipment had been programmed to meet Federal standards during laboratory tests, but not during actual driving on the road. 
 What sets the Toyota case apart is the company's decision to fight the Government in court. In previous cases, involving General Motors in 1995, Honda a year ago and seven manufacturers of heavy-duty diesel engines last October, the manufacturers chose to pay fines and take remedial action before litigation began.
Toyota's stance in theory exposes it to large penalties. Christine Romano, a Justice Department spokeswoman, said that under the Clean Air Act, Toyota could face a fine of $25,000 to $27,500 for each of 2.2 million vehicles that allegedly failed to comply, depending on when each vehicle was sold.
But the maximum possible penalty, nearly $60 billion, is extremely unlikely. The law directs judges to consider a company's economic gain from pollution, its previous environmental record and its ability to stay in business if it pays the maximum fine. Toyota has a fairly good environmental record, its gains from the alleged pollution are unclear and the maximum fine would equal eight months of its global sales.
Previous settlements out of court have been much smaller. Honda, for example, settled a similar dispute a year ago involving 1.7 million Honda and Acura automobiles. To offset any emissions from vehicles with poorly functioning warning lights, Honda extended the warranty on all of these vehicles' emissions equipment to 14 years or 150,000 miles instead of 3 years or 36,000 miles, and offered free tuneups, at a cost estimated by Federal officials at $250 million.
Honda also paid $10.1 million in Federal fines and $2.5 million in fines to the state of California, which also accused the auto maker of violating state rules. And Honda agreed to pay for $1 million of Federal environmental research and $3.5 million of environmental research by California. Those $17.1 million in payments plus the warranty costs were considerably less than the company's likely liability in excess of $42.5 billion.
California also ordered Toyota last September to come up with a plan to fix 330,000 vehicles sold there that are among the 2.2 million vehicles involved in the Federal case. Toyota refused, and hearings began today before an administrative law judge in Sacramento.
In the Federal case, Toyota on Friday rejected a settlement offer that involved fines of more than $100 million.
The current dispute involves vehicles' so-called evaporative emissions of unburned gasoline, which contribute to smog. Toyota contends that state and Federal rules require vehicles' warning lights to meet tests only in laboratories. Tiny quantities of gasoline fumes constantly escape from a vehicle's gas cap and from joints in the gasoline tank and fuel lines. These losses are periodically monitored by vehicles in recent model years using systems that measure the pressure of the gasoline vapor in the system. A warning light is supposed to go on when the pressure falls while the ignition is on.
The rules do not give regulators the authority to conduct random checks, as they have done, on whether the vehicles actually perform in use the way they did in the laboratory, said Joseph Tetherow, a company spokesman.
The vehicles "only had to meet lab tests," Mr. Tetherow said.
When California first adopted rules in 1991 regarding the evaporative emissions and the activation of engine lights, Toyota developed a system and it passed the state's laboratory tests and was certified for use, Mr. Tetherow said, adding, "They said it was in compliance, they gave their approval before we went ahead and put it in our vehicles."
Jerry Martin, a spokesman for the California Air Resources Board, said that, "in-use compliance has always been a part of the board's program." Regardless of how the administrative law judge rules, the board can subsequently rule for or against the company, Mr. Martin said.
Environmental regulators contend that without reliable warning lights, consumers will not know when their vehicles start producing unacceptable levels of pollution.
Carol M. Browner, the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, said tonight, "Today's action shows this Administration's commitment to insure that companies will not profit from polluting and that the public health will be protected."
The Justice Department filed today's lawsuit on behalf of the Environmental Protection Agency.
The suit covers most of Toyota's vehicles from the 1996 through 1998 model years. Specifically, it covers Lexus cars as well as Toyota Camry, Avalon, Corolla, Tercel, and Paseo cars; Sienna minivans; 4Runner and RAV4 sport utility vehicles; and Tacoma and T100 pickup trucks.
Mr. Tetherow said that none of the vehicles involved posed any threat to the environment or public safety. If the warning lights on all of these vehicles failed, the combined annual evaporation of hydrocarbons from their fuel tanks and engines would be equal to the painting of two medium-sized houses, he said.
The Clean Air Act allows a maximum penalty of $25,000 per vehicle sold by Jan. 31, 1997, and $27,500 per vehicle sold after that. Toyota sold 588,650 vehicles in the 1996 model year with the contested emissions systems, 857,620 in the 1997 model year and 735,897 in the 1998 model year. But Ms. Romano said she did not have the precise number sold before the date when the peak penalty rose.

Vietnamese Cuisine With an Accent on Fresh and Lively

BYLINE: By Eric Asimov 

 BODY:
TEN years ago, New York had only a couple of Vietnamese restaurants in the Chinatown area and one or two other Manhattan outposts. But in the early 1990's, Vietnamese restaurants began to pop up all over, becoming novel pleasures and then neighborhood staples.
With popularity, though, came Chinese Restaurant Syndrome, in which takeout becomes so lucrative that a restaurant degenerates into an assembly-line delivery operation, forsaking freshness for economy and speed. Several Vietnamese restaurants fell victim to this, but they did not remain popular, and they closed. Unlike Chinese restaurants, which can apparently get away with using lots of oil and cooking everything to death, Vietnamese restaurants showcase light, fresh ingredients, with plenty of herbs, salads and raw vegetables. Forsake these, and the cuisine loses its reason for being. 
 Saigon Grill, which opened its first, very small restaurant several years ago on the Upper West Side, understands the need to safeguard the flavors. Even though it does a sizable takeout business, it has never sacrificed liveliness for speed. Now, with a new branch on the Upper East Side that opened a month ago, Saigon Grill is proving again to be a top-flight Vietnamese restaurant.
Though it's twice as big as the first place, Saigon Grill is still not much to look at -- simply a bright, plain dining room. The food is the thing. Chao tom ($3.95), for example, a common appetizer of grilled shrimp paste wrapped around a short stalk of sugar cane, is often bland and tasteless, more appealing in theory than in practice. But Saigon Grill's version is rich and shrimpy. To eat it, remove the thick paste from the cane, and then wrap the paste in a lettuce leaf with some mint and pickled carrot. Dip the whole thing in nuoc cham, the sweet-and-tangy condiment, and you have a wonderful dish.
Banh cuon ($4.95) is also a superb appetizer, a soft cylindrical rice crepe stuffed with chicken, mushrooms and carrots and served with the piquant nuoc cham. Goi cuon tom ($4.25), a shrimp summer roll, is soft and soothing, full of mint and basil and with a pronounced anise flavor. Goi du du ($4.95), green papaya salad, is spicy and well balanced, flavored with basil and pungent nuoc mam, or fermented fish sauce, and topped with thin strips of grilled beef and crushed peanuts. Goi tom nuong ($5.95) is a refreshing salad of greens, cabbage, carrots and cucumber topped with grilled shrimp.
Appetizers are so good that it is tempting to make a meal of them, especially in hot weather, but Saigon Grill offers some delicious main courses, among them noodle dishes like bun with chicken ($6.95), which is thin, cool rice noodles with salad, herbs and savory grilled chicken served satay-style on wooden skewers. It is sometimes difficult to remove the chicken from the skewers without sending it flying across the table or puncturing yourself. Goi banh cuon with beef ($6.95), thin, warm rice crepes topped with herbs and beef, also suffers from the skewer problem, but the combination, activated by a dose of nuoc cham, is worth the effort.
Xuong nuong ($7.95), very thin grilled pork chops, tastes pleasingly of lemongrass and lime, while tom kho to ($9.95) is worth trying for the combination of shrimp and bean-curd skin in a soupy brown sauce tasting of garlic and pepper. Occasionally, the food is underseasoned, like thit xao gung ($7.95), sauteed pork in a traditional honey-ginger sauce, which needed an extra jolt of fish sauce to bring out the flavors.
This is just a taste of the extensive menu, which also includes the soups that I like so much at the West Side branch. Saigon Grill doesn't yet have its liquor license, but it has something better: Vietnamese iced coffee ($2), made with sweetened condensed milk. It tastes like a coffee milkshake and is better than dessert.

HEADLINE: Pay Off the Debt

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Re "The Trillion-Dollar Problem" (editorial, July 12): Every economic statistic brings home the fact that our economy is as close to full employment as it can hope to be without inflation. A contemplated tax cut of any magnitude would add significantly to purchasing power, thereby immediately stoking inflation. 
 The tax cut has been justified with the argument that the surplus represents excess money that belongs to the taxpayer. This ignores that from 1980 on, not enough taxes were collected.
We as a country have an obligation to pay back the debt then incurred. It also ignores that the present economy owes its stability to the ongoing reduction of the national debt, leaving more investment capital in private hands.

HEADLINE: U.S. Import Prices Declined 0.2% in June

BYLINE: Reuters 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 13

 BODY:
Import prices fell in June after rising for three consecutive months as the cost of oil and other imports declined, the Labor Department reported today.
Import prices fell two-tenths of a percent last month after rising a revised eight-tenths of a percent in May. The May figure had initially been reported as a rise of seven-tenths of a percent. 
 Prices of major imports like oil and farm products have been weak the last couple of years as economic crises in Asia and Latin America have depressed worldwide demand.
That has helped keep inflation down in the United States. In the 12 months ended in May, the Consumer Price Index rose only 2.1 percent. The consumer price report for June is scheduled to be released at 8:30 A.M. on Thursday.
Petroleum import prices fell nine-tenths of a percent in June after a 7.8 percent rise in May that was revised from 8 percent. It was the first time since February that petroleum import prices fell. In the last three months, hefty gains were reported on petroleum import prices.
Excluding petroleum, import prices declined two-tenths of a percent in June after a two-tenths of a percent rise in May, which was revised from one-tenth of a percent. Import prices for all major categories fell in June.
The Labor Department said United States export prices were unchanged in June after a revised increase of one-tenth of a percent in May, which had previously been reported as flat.
Prices of agricultural exports fell two-tenths of a percent in June after gaining four-tenths of a percent in May, which had previously been reported as a rise of one-tenth of a percent. Nonagricultural export prices were down one-tenth of a percent after rising one-tenth of a percent in May.

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS;
Japanese Regulators Consider Penalties for Credit Suisse

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE STROM 

DATELINE: TOKYO, July 13

 BODY:
Japanese regulators met today to consider possible sanctions against Credit Suisse Group for obstructing a six-month investigation into its financial activities in Japan.
Credit Suisse, based in Switzerland and one of the world's biggest investment banks, could lose at least one of its licenses to do business in Japan, according to a Government official, and it might face criminal prosecution as well. 
 If the Japanese authorities were to revoke the license of Credit Suisse's Financial Products, which handles the firm's derivatives products business, it would cut off a large source of profit. Such a punishment also would turn into a huge embarrassment for Credit Suisse, which has acknowledged some problems in its derivatives business in Japan but says it has taken action to correct them.
The regulators who met today are officials of the Financial Supervisory Agency, Japan's financial watchdog. The agency also handed over the findings of its investigation to Credit Suisse's Tokyo office today. Results of the investigation were not immediately released.
"We are working to try to persuade the F.S.A. to levy fair penalties on Credit Suisse Group in Japan in light of our acknowledged shortcomings," said Robert Baker, a Credit Suisse spokesman in London."This should be balanced by the clear legality of our past transaction activity and by our discovery, reporting and prompt disciplinary action in relation to the conduct of a small number of our employees in Tokyo."
The investigation of Credit Suisse has received close scrutiny from foreign investment banks here as an indicator of how Japan will deal with them as it cleans up the country's debt-ridden banking system and eases financial market regulations.
The firm engaged in so-called window dressing, using a variety of financial trading tools to help Japanese banks and companies obscure their losses. Oddly, Credit Suisse is not likely to be punished heavily for that activity. Indeed, the legality of that business does not seem to be in question, although the Financial Supervisory Agency has begun investigating similar operations of Lehman Brothers here.
What outraged the regulators were efforts by Michael Winning, the executive in charge of handling legal matters at Credit Suisse in Tokyo, and other executives based here to hide the firm's activities by shredding some documents and shipping others out of the country.
Those activities, which Credit Suisse has acknowledged, give officials here grounds to refer the case to the public prosecutor's office for a criminal trial, which could result in financial penalties and even jail terms.
The case has been compared to the scandal that hurt Daiwa Bank in the United States several years ago when it tried to cover up more than $1 billion in trading losses at its New York branch. After United States regulators began their investigation at Daiwa, a Daiwa employee broke the seal on a box of evidence, which, among other things, led to a record fine of $340 million when Daiwa pleaded guilty in 1996.
In Tokyo, Credit Suisse suspended Mr. Winning and others who participated in the attempted cover-up and withheld the bonuses of other employees. But it has contended that its employees were engaged in an effort to hide evidence of violations of the "fire wall" -- the strict regulatory barrier aimed at keeping its banking operations separate from its securities operations -- not to thwart the agency's investigators and cover up evidence related to window dressing.
The authorities here began to scrutinize Credit Suisse's window dressing when Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan and Nippon Credit Bank were nationalized by the Government last year. Both banks were Credit Suisse clients, and their employees helped investigators understand how the banks had hidden their losses using Credit Suisse products and services.

HEADLINE: Palestinians Move to Avoid Friction With Israel at U.N.

BYLINE: By WILLIAM A. ORME Jr. 

DATELINE: JERUSALEM, July 13

 BODY:
In an effort to avert friction with Israel's new Government, Palestinian leaders will seek the speedy adjournment of a United Nations meeting that was to have considered possible sanctions against Israel for human rights violations and settlement activity in Gaza and the West Bank.
The meeting, in Geneva on Thursday, should end after just "an hour or two" of formal remarks and resolutions to hold a future conference on the issue, a senior Palestinian official said today. The conference had been intended as an open-ended examination of Israeli control of the West Bank and Gaza, sponsored by the General Assembly and led by Switzerland, in its role as custodian of the Geneva Convention. 
 "This is a compromise," said Nabil Shaath, the Palestinian Authority's minister for planning and international cooperation, in a telephone interview from Geneva. "The idea is to make the message clear, but not confrontational."
In public statements and in meetings with Western diplomats here, the newly appointed Foreign Minister, David Levy, has said the conference could be a divisive distraction from the planned resumption of peace talks. Though Palestinian officials say Prime Minister Ehud Barak did not raise the conference in his 75-minute meeting Sunday with the Palestinian leader, Yasir Arafat, Mr. Barak stressed the importance of beginning comprehensive negotiations in an atmosphere of mutual trust, without recriminations.
"We are really giving Barak an opportunity to set up his program of action," Mr. Shaath said.
But Israeli diplomats criticized the Palestinian plan to reconvene the conference in November, or next January. "We see this entire exercise as an attempt to single out Israel, and we firmly reject it," Dore Gold, Israel's representative at the United Nations, said today in a telephone interview from New York.
American and Israeli diplomats are urging European members of a steering commission for the gathering to oppose setting a new date for the conference, which could in theory attempt to impose economic sanctions or other penalties on Israel. The threat of such a conference would be "a sword of Damocles hanging over the peace process," said one Israeli official.
In February, the United Nations General Assembly almost unanimously adopted a resolution calling for a conference of all Geneva Convention signers on July 15 to examine violations of the convention by Israel in the occupied territories of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. Israel and the United States cast the only dissenting votes.
Since then Israeli diplomats have tried without success to scuttle the conference, contending that there is no precedent for a new Geneva Conference focusing on a single regional conflict.
"The signatories of the Convention have never been convened for any purpose since 1949 -- not when the Soviets invaded Czechoslovakia or Afghanistan, or when the Iraqis invaded Kuwait," Mr. Gold said. Israeli diplomats say they have sought to persuade other United Nations members with histories of border wars that there could be similar intervention in their own territorial disputes.
The Geneva meeting is being boycotted by the United States, as well as by Israel, which says that Australia and several other United Nations members have also decided to avoid the session.
Palestinian officials who originally pushed for the conference acknowledged that their motivation was to bypass the standard diplomatic mechanisms of the United Nations, where anti-Israel resolutions are passed overwhelmingly by the General Assembly only to be quashed by American vetoes in the Security Council.
Mr. Shaath, one of the architects of the conference, suggested a few months ago that the tenets of the original convention would permit imposing penalties against Israel for its treatment of the occupied territories.
Today, he struck a more conciliatory note, while emphasizing the continuing Palestinian concern about Israeli settlers and a commitment to an eventual meeting on the issue.

Dow Falls, Led by Banks, on Fears About Latin Markets

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
Stocks fell yesterday, led by big banks, including J. P. Morgan & Company and Citigroup Inc., on concern that volatile Latin American financial markets could hurt profits for companies that do business in the region.
But stocks pared losses in late trading on optimism for corporate earnings reports as worries about Latin America waned, investors said. 
 "The reality is we're getting a spate of earnings reports this week and next, and we think those will be at or above expectations," said Robert Christian, chief investment officer for Wilmington Trust, which oversees $25 billion in Wilmington, Del.
The Dow Jones industrial average fell 25.96 points, to 11,175.02, slicing a 116-point decline as Latin American financial markets rebounded and the Procter & Gamble Company gained after announcing a dividend increase.
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index dropped 5.54 points, to 1,393.56, and the Nasdaq composite index declined 12.21 points, to 2,778.23.
The price of the 30-year Treasury bond fell 1/32, to 90 29/32. The bond's yield was unchanged at 5.90 percent.
Stocks may fall today in response to a report from Intel that second-quarter profit was lower than expected at 51 cents a share, compared with the latest analysts' estimate of 57 cents. Shares of Intel traded at 65 1/8 after the announcement; they had closed earlier with a loss of 1/16 at 65 3/8.
Traders sold Argentine bonds Monday and in early trading yesterday after the ruling party's presidential candidate said he might seek to renegotiate the Government's $130 billion of debt. Latin American markets recovered as Wall Street firms reassured clients that Argentina would weather the crisis. The candidate, Eduardo Duhalde, backtracked this afternoon and said he would not seek debt relief.
Banks that do business in Latin America or trade stocks and bonds from the region declined. J. P. Morgan fell 2 5/16, to 138 1/4, contributing 12 points to the Dow average's loss. While Latin America accounts for only 4 percent of J. P. Morgan's assets, the region contributed 17 percent of the bank's $963 million of earnings last year.
Citigroup lost 1 1/16, to 47 11/16, and the Chase Manhattan Corporation fell 1 1/2, to 82 5/8.
Procter & Gamble gained 1 15/16, to 88 15/16, after the company, a maker of household products, said it would raise its dividend 12 percent as cost-cutting bolsters company profits.
Merrill Lynch & Company rose 1 3/8, to 79 1/4, after the brokerage firm said second-quarter profit grew 23 percent. The firm earned $1.57 a share in the quarter, above the $1.46 average forecast by analysts surveyed by the First Call Corporation and the $1.31 a share it earned in the quarter a year earlier.
Some investors were not willing to make big bets on stocks until they see the Producer Price Index and retail sales reports due today, and the Consumer Price Index report due tomorrow. Those reports will provide clues to whether the Federal Reserve will have to raise interest rates again this year to head off inflation and keep the economy growing.

HEADLINE: Would Tax Cuts Prove Too Stimulating?

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE

 BODY:
For all the recent talk of cutting taxes, Congress rarely cuts them when the economy is growing robustly, as it is today, and unemployment is low. The worry among economists is that the extra money in people's pockets may make an already strong economy too strong, finally stoking inflation after a long period of relatively stable prices.
Yet that danger is hardly mentioned in the rising public debate over the Republican and Democratic proposals for tax cuts. 
 Why not? In part, it is because the advocates of the tax cuts, as well as many of the opponents, agree that any reductions will probably be small, at least in the initial years. And few analysts expect any final tax cut to come close to the $864 billion over the next decade that has been proposed by House Republicans.
"Most of the tax cut proposals are phased in gradually over a number of years," said Senator Connie Mack, Republican of Florida, the chairman of Congress's Joint Economic Committee and the author of a proposal to cut taxes by $137 billion over 10 years, most of it toward the end of the period. "I think the immediate economic stimulus will be small," he said.
The Federal Reserve, however, is concerned. "If taxes were cut while the nation's resources are highly employed, that would put more pressure on monetary policy," Edward M. Gramlich, a Fed governor, said. He suggested, in effect, that the Fed might have to raise interest rates to prevent the extra spending that would overstimulate the economy. Others worry that the higher rates might reduce investment or bring down inflated stock prices, damaging the economy through these avenues.
Stock prices should already be reacting to the prospect of a tax cut, some people say, but they have not so far because too many people on Wall Street express doubt that tax cut legislation will be enacted before next year's election -- or soon afterward, for that matter.
"A bunch of friends on Wall Street have asked me why the markets are so quiet about the tax cut proposals," said James E. Glassman, a senior economist at Chase Manhattan Bank. "Wall Street is unusually quiet because it realizes that there will just be gridlock on this issue near term -- a lot of proposals and no real action."
Still, Mr. Gramlich's concern reflects a view widely shared among economists -- that broad tax cuts tend to stimulate spending and therefore should be reserved for recessions or periods of slow growth. In the early 1960's, President John F. Kennedy proposed a tax cut in this spirit, and President Ronald Reagan's tax cuts, which started during a recession, contributed to the long expansion in the 1980's.
By contrast, President Lyndon B. Johnson's 10 percent income tax cut, carrying through on the original Kennedy proposal, came when the economy had turned from the weak Kennedy years to the much more robust mid-1960's. The Fed responded by raising rates.
And the altered mix was damaging, says Alan S. Blinder, a Princeton University economist who served as Fed vice chairman from 1994 to 1996. The new mix -- higher interest rates to offset more fiscal stimulus from the tax cut and from stepped-up spending for the Vietnam War and for the Johnson social programs -- shifted the economy toward consumption and away from investment. Inflation also got a foothold.
Some economists contend that fiscal policy has lost its punch since the 1960's while monetary policy has evolved to the point that the Fed can regulate the economy through interest rate adjustments, offsetting tax cuts without damage.
"Monetary policy administered by the Fed is far more important as far as economic stabilization is concerned and regulating aggregate demand," said James Gwertney, the Republican-appointed chief economist of the Joint Economic panel.
Mr. Blinder disagrees. Monetary policy has its limits, he said. A tax cut offset by higher interest rates today "would reverse the policy mix that we have followed in the 1990's with such splendid effect: low interest rates and high corporate investment," Mr. Blinder said.
Henry Kaufman, a Wall Street economist and consultant, adds a related reason for not using the budget surplus to finance tax cuts, as both parties now propose. "With the surplus, we could have some timely fiscal action when the economy goes inevitably into recession," he said. "We would not for once have to worry about deficit financing."
Clinton Administration officials say that their more modest tax cut proposal gets around the problem of encouraging too much consumption. By offering incentives, particularly to the poor, to invest the tax cuts in retirement accounts, they say, private savings will rise, and the savings will then be available for corporations to borrow and invest in productive equipment.
But many economists say that such tax rebates would not go dollar for dollar into retirement accounts. Upper-income people in particular have the wherewithal to shift savings from one account to another to qualify for a tax refund, which would then be spent on consumer goods, according to this view. That has been the experience with individual retirement accounts.
This is not the supply-side view. For supply-siders, tax cuts -- particularly a Republican proposal to reduce the capital gains tax on the profit made from the sale of stocks and other assets -- encourage investment by reducing its risk. While supply-siders are a distinct minority among economists, they are a vocal one in the incipient debate about a tax cut's effect on the economy.
In their view, suppliers, not consumers, are the chief economic actors. And suppliers respond to tax cuts by investing their capital in new supply. Far from stimulating demand beyond an economy's capacity, the supply-siders say, a tax cut increases the supply of goods and services, which are then consumed.
No one pushes this view harder than Jude Wanniski, an economics consultant and adviser to Steve Forbes and various other Republicans involved in tax-cutting proposals. "The Government, by cutting tax rates, is simply removing the barrier to investment," he said.

HEADLINE: 'What Is China?' Taiwan's New Answer Is Puzzling

BYLINE: By SETH FAISON 

DATELINE: BEIJING, July 13

 BODY:
What in the world is Taiwan's President up to?
It's a question that puzzled countless Government officials, scholars and common people in China and Taiwan today, many of them surprised by the news that the President, Lee Teng-hui, had suddenly changed the island's official stance toward China by dropping his Nationalist Government's long-standing premise that Taiwan and the mainland are parts of the same country. 
 Danger was the first word in many minds, because tampering with Taiwan's political status is akin to tweaking a hornet's nest, easily provoking military action from Beijing, where eventual reunification with Taiwan is considered a patriotic imperative.
Taiwan and China have acted independently of each other for the 50 years since Chiang Kai-shek's Nationalist forces retreated to the island, defeated by the Communists in a civil war.
But any hint that Taiwan is moving toward a formal declaration of independence rings loud alarm bells in Beijing. Mr. Lee's shift inevitably complicates relations between Beijing and Washington, which itself continues to abide by the one-China formula, and local politics in Taiwan, where a presidential campaign is getting under way.
Yet Mr. Lee seems to be looking farther afield.
Expected to step down next spring after 12 years in office, a time of remarkable transition in Taiwan from an authoritarian state to an economically lively democracy, Mr. Lee appears to want to cement his legacy as the father of a modern Taiwan separate from mainland China.
Politicians and scholars who have followed the career of Mr. Lee, Taiwan's first native-born President, say he is driven by a overwhelming sense of mission.
"Lee Teng-hui in his heart is a romantic," said Fung Hu-hsiang, a Taiwan legislator who opposes Mr. Lee's moves away from China. "In his later years, his sense of mission is pushing him to clarify Taiwan's role with the mainland."
Yet Mr. Fung, a political opponent of Mr. Lee who believes the policy shift is potentially disasterous, cited another possibility echoed by several political analysts: Mr. Lee may want to create a crisis to justify a postponement of next year's election so that he can remain in office.
In March 1996, China launched several missiles into the ocean near Taiwan in what was officially described as a military exercise but was clearly intended to intimidate voters who were about to cast votes in Taiwan's first free presidential election.
But instead of being intimidated, anxious voters rallied around Mr. Lee, giving him an overwhelming victory. It was a risky strategy, but Mr. Lee apparently reasoned that the chances of a military invasion by China were slight, and he was proved right.
"If it's like 1996 again, and missiles are raining down, he could try to justify staying on," said Chang Ling-chen, a political science professor at National Taiwan University. "If China is smart, they won't respond so strongly this time."
Mr. Lee's new move came on Saturday when he said in a German radio interview that China and Taiwan should deal with each other on a "state to state" basis, implying that they are two separate countries. On Monday, a Government spokesman, clarifying Mr. Lee's remarks, went a step further and dropped the "one China" idea that has guided China-Taiwan ties, effectively giving up the notion of eventual reunification.
It all complicates Taiwan presidential politics, perhaps most notably for James Soong, the popular former official from Mr. Lee's Nationalist Party, who is expected to run as an independent. Mr. Soong's position on relations with Beijing is less than clear, and a new focus on the issue could damage him.
But of paramount concern to outsiders is the reaction from Beijing, whose long-held official position is that reunification of the motherland is a historical necessity and that it will use military force to achieve it if negotiations fail. Short of military action, China could apply economic pressure on Taiwan.
Today China's state-run media issued some of the vitriol that has come to be expected on this issue from the Communist authorities, who called Mr. Lee's move "a monumental disaster."
Yet Beijing's public response was not as harsh as could have been. Zhang Qiyue, a Foreign Ministry spokeswoman, sidestepped several questions about Taiwan, suggesting that China's leadership is mulling a course of action, which could take some time.
"They're probably trying to figure out what Lee is doing, and why he is doing it now," said an international relations scholar in Beijing, who felt the topic too sensitive to be quoted by name. "They may think the U.S. is behind him, telling him what to do."
In fact, American diplomats here seemed as surprised as anyone by Mr. Lee's move, which counters Washington's efforts to push Taiwan and China into meaningful discussions.
A critical meeting is scheduled for October in Taiwan with China's top Taiwan negotiator, Wang Daohan, who would be the most senior official from Beijing to visit since the civil war ended in 1949. Whether that meeting will be held is now in doubt.

HEADLINE: Whirlpool Posts Earnings Rise

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: BENTON HARBOR, Mich., July 13

 BODY:
The Whirlpool Corporation, the largest United States maker of appliances, said today that its second-quarter profit rose a more-than-expected 23 percent on higher sales in North America.
Net income at the company, which makes Kenmore, Kitchenaid and Whirlpool products, rose to $99 million, or $1.30 a share, compared with profit from operations of $81 million, or $1.05 a share, a year earlier. Whirlpool had been expected to earn $1.24, the average estimate of nine analysts surveyed by the First Call Corporation. 
 Rising demand in North America, where Whirlpool gets almost three-fourths of its profit, offset the impact of recession in Brazil, Latin America's largest economy. The company said it expected to continue its strong performance in the second half.
"Low interest rates, high housing activity and strong consumer confidence are boosting appliance sales in the United States," said Efraim Levy, an analyst at Standard & Poor's, who rates the shares as "accumulate."
Sales rose 1.2 percent, to $2.62 billion from $2.59 billion.
Whirlpool announced the results after United States stock markets had closed. Its shares fell $1.4375, to $70.8125.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: Market Place;
ArgentinaRattles a Bit, and Latin Investors Shake

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER 

 BODY:
Worries about Latin America have spooked investors again. And when worried, they jump for the relative safety of the American bond market.
The result has been a nice rally in bonds, despite the looming possibility of another interest rate increase by Federal Reserve policy makers in August. 
 The latest market tremors come from Argentina, now facing a tough recession, a growing budget deficit and a presidential election in October. All that adds up to building uncertainty about the country's economic restructuring -- something not helped by a presidential candidate's comment last weekend that he would ask the Pope to support debt relief.
On Monday, the prices of Argentine bonds fell sharply, pushing interest rates higher, and the country's main stock index dropped 8.7 percent. The selloff spread quickly to markets in Brazil, Mexico and the rest of Latin America.
Yesterday, Argentina had a small rebound and the demand for United States Treasury securities eased. The yield on the 30-year Treasury bond, which dropped to 5.90 percent on Monday from 6.00 percent on Friday, was unchanged. Several emerging-market analysts said that the Latin American selloff had been overdone and that fears of an Argentine bond default or currency devaluation were overblown.
But even if the markets went too far, the outlook for Latin markets for the next several months is no longer rosy.
Some analysts expect continued pressure on Argentina's markets. And such concerns could spill over to the rest of the region, especially if the Fed decides to raise rates further next month. Higher United States rates would make it harder for Latin nations to attract foreign capital.
"What worries me is all the noise you can have between here and the election," Jose Luis Daza, managing director of emerging markets at J. P. Morgan Securities, said.
Joaquin Cottani, chief economist for Latin America at Lehman Brothers, said that Argentina would continue to be a "target of instability."
"The only thing that the Government will be able to do," he said, "is try to convince investors that this has been an overreaction, that things are likely to improve." Still, he noted, "Nobody expects, even in the Government, that the situation will be too good for the rest of the year."
Concerns about Argentina's economic future cannot be cleared up easily. The election will produce a new administration, with unknown policies, and until then the candidates may try to attract domestic votes with comments that unsettle international investors.
The selloff on Monday was a case in point. Gov. Eduardo Duhalde of Buenos Aires, a presidential candidate, said he wanted to ask Pope John Paul II to support a debt moratorium for Argentina and other struggling countries.
For the market, that was not a good move. Investors grow uneasy over suggestions that a country may not keep paying its debt, even though a candidate's priorities may shift when elected. Venezuela's new President, Hugo Chavez, spoke of restructuring that nation's debt during his campaign, but since taking office has tried to reassure investors.
In Argentina, until the election is resolved, there is little the outgoing Government of Carlos Saul Menem can do to rebuild investor confidence.
Argentina is expected to be able to meet its borrowing needs for the rest of the year, which diminishes any immediate threat of default. But there is a much greater likelihood of corporate defaults, Mr. Cottani said.
Also by the first quarter of next year, the outlook on a Government default could be more uncertain. And it will fall to a new administration to determine how large the financing gap will be and how to bridge it. "We will have time to see whether the risks remain entering the first quarter of next year," Mr. Cottani said.
Mr. Daza said that Latin American interest rates do not indicate investor fears about an Argentine debt default. Short-term rates would be higher than longer-term rates if the markets were worried, he said.
But the widening spreads between the rates on Latin debt and those for comparable United States Treasury debt show that many investors are indeed concerned about their ability to sell Latin bonds quickly, and without big losses, if the Argentine situation -- or the overall outlook -- takes a sudden turn for the worse.
According to J. P. Morgan, the spread for Argentina shrank yesterday by 35 basis points -- or hundredths of a percentage point -- after widening 98 points Monday, to 9.72 percent. At the same time, the spread between Brazil's debt and comparable American bonds narrowed by just 1 basis point after widening by 70 points Monday. And the spread with Mexico grew by 10 basis points after widening by 56 points Monday.
Thus, the markets seem to have overreacted Monday to Argentina's situation. But its problems continue to concern investors about countries that have been considered safer bets.
On the plus side, the market climate for Latin America is much better than last summer and fall, when first Russia defaulted on its debt and devalued its currency and then Long Term Capital Management, the giant hedge fund, teetered near collapse.
But, as Mr. Daza said, the Argentine Government and the nation's presidential candidates "need to work more to calm the markets."
Given the sensitivity of investors, that is no small task. "The guy who got mauled last year is saying 'I have to lighten up,' " Barbara Kenworthy, portfolio manager at Prudential Mutual Funds, said. "People are antsy."

HEADLINE: Merrill Posts 23% Increase In Earnings

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY L. O'BRIEN 

 BODY:
Merrill Lynch & Company, the nation's largest brokerage firm, posted robust second quarter earnings yesterday, even as the financial powerhouse struggles with infighting and tension in its upper ranks. 
 Buoyed by a stock market that continued to produce gravity-defying gains last quarter, Merrill reported earnings of $673 million, or $1.57 a share, up 23 percent from the $549 million, or $1.31 a share, it earned in the corresponding period last year.
Merrill's earnings easily topped analysts' expectations of $1.46 a share, according to consensus estimates compiled by the First Call Corporation. In trading yesterday on the New York Stock Exchange, shares of Merrill rose $1.375, or about 1.8 percent, to $79.25.
But Merrill's shares still trade well below their 52-week high of $109.125, and should the stock market slow or the economy enter a recession, Merrill's earnings could suffer. Indeed, Merrill may be vulnerable to a takeover later this year or next if its stock price weakens or if it is unable to successfully execute its plans to bolster its sales presence on the Internet.
"I think Merrill is very well positioned for the global trends driving the industry today -- investment banking trends in Europe, strong trends in the U.S. that continue and Asia's longer-term prospects," said Richard Strauss, a securities industry analyst with Goldman, Sachs & Company. "But investors are also going to be keeping a close eye on its Internet strategy, and in the near term I think that expectation is just as important."
The sharp reversal in Merrill's fortunes in the last year has produced a startling shift in how the once seemingly impregnable firm is perceived by many of its competitors and Wall Street. The firm's finances were hammered by last year's economic chaos overseas, and it was slower than firms like the Charles Schwab Corporation to embrace the enthusiasm for trading that is sweeping the Internet.
On Monday, Merrill announced that Herbert M. Allison Jr., its president, resigned after being told he would not run the firm one day. Mr. Allison, a cool, detached figure who seemed oddly out of sync in Merrill's gregarious, hard-driving culture, had been at odds with Merrill's chief executive, David H. Komansky, for some time. Differences within the firm about how to respond to the growth of the Internet also added to managerial tensions.
While the stock market seemed to react mildly to Mr. Allison's departure, there is still concern about the lack of a clear successor to Mr. Komansky and how quickly the company will put its house in order.
"There's a sense around the Street that Merrill is adrift," said a senior executive at a rival firm. "I still marvel at where this company was two years ago and where they are today."
Merrill counters that it is focused on achieving its financial goals and has managers in place who are up to the task of running the firm in an era of brutal competition and rapid change in the financial services industry.
"We're very fortunate to have many talented executives in senior management and great bench strength," said Paul W. Critchlow, a Merrill spokesman.
Nonetheless, some analysts yesterday questioned how deep Merrill's managerial bench truly is. Leading candidates to succeed Mr. Komansky include John L. Steffens, a vice chairman who heads on-line efforts and supervises the firm's army of retail brokers, and Jeffrey M. Peek, who oversees asset management. Beyond that, some say, the candidates are slim.
Although attention has focused on Mr. Allison's shortcomings since his resignation was announced, Mr. Komansky has presided over a string of high-profile blunders or miscues in recent years. Those include the aggressive marketing of complex financial products known as derivatives to Orange County, Calif., which helped send the county into bankruptcy; a big expansion into emerging markets, which created financial headaches last year, and an unusually deep involvement in the near collapse of the Long-Term Capital Management hedge fund.
Although Merrill also has had difficulties with its $5 billion acquisition of the British firm, Mercury Asset Management, which it acquired last year, Merrill said Mercury's funds were performing better and that it was "absolutely happy" with its returns on that investment.
Merrill's earnings announcement yesterday disclosed smart gains in its overall asset-management business. Revenue from the business was up a record 7 percent from last year, to $1.16 billion, while total assets under management grew 5 percent, to $516 billion.
Analysts were generally pleased with the results from asset management and other key units as well.
"Trading was a bit lighter than I expected and investment banking a bit better," said Joan S. Solotar, an analyst at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette. "Over all, it was a solid quarter."
In the period, Merrill's net revenue, which includes interest income less interest expense, rose 12 percent, to a record $5.4 billion. Commissions rose 8.8 percent, to $1.59 billion, and trading revenue jumped 7.6 percent, to $1.06 billion.
Investment banking revenue totaled $908 million in the second quarter, up 1.1 percent from last year's booming quarter. Merrill said equity underwriting revenue was sharply higher from that of last year's second quarter, and nearly double the levels recorded in the first quarter of 1999. But underwriting fees in most debt categories declined in the second quarter, reflecting concerns about interest rates, the firm said.
Analysts said they expected Merrill to post solid results for the third quarter. But uncertainty about the firm will probably emerge starting in December, when Merrill is scheduled to introduce new Internet-related products and trading accounts.
"People are worried about the fourth quarter, when on-line trading and the retail products that come along with it will be rolled out," said Sallie Krawcheck, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Company.
Other analysts shared Ms. Krawcheck's interest in how Merrill's Internet strategy will be deployed.
"There is an inherent conflict with their brokers, which may be compounded by the fact that Launny Steffens will be running both the retail and Internet sides of the business," Ms. Solotar said. "I am hopeful management realizes it needs a cohesive Internet strategy and has a window of five months to put it together."

A Refurbished Tower Keeps Its Feel

BYLINE: By JOHN HOLUSHA 

 BODY:
Yes, the Noguchi sculptures are still in place on the first floor of the building at 666 Fifth Avenue and they are actually much easier to see because of the renovations, despite the fears of preservationists. The fears were expressed at the beginning of the just-completed $20 million upgrading of the building, between 52d and 53d Streets, which included converting the T-shaped pedestrian arcade and lobby, with their Noguchi sculptures, into a unified enclosed space slathered in marble.
For the first time, Isamu Noguchi's "waterfall" fountain, a 40-foot-wide combination of corrugated glass, undulating stainless-steel fins and trickling water, is now visible from Fifth Avenue because of the elimination of a retail space long used by Alitalia as a ticket office. 
 Officials of Sumitomo Realty and Development, a subsidiary of Sumitomo, the Japanese company, said the renovation was designed to bring the entrance of the building out to Fifth Avenue and make more productive use of the retail spaces, which had been chopped into small stores and recessed behind building columns.
The Noguchi fountain was never in danger, said Arthur L. Bocchi, a senior managing director of Sumitomo, but another Noguchi work, the "landscape of the clouds" ceiling over the elevator banks, came in for a hard look.
"When you do a renovation, you look at everything, and many tenants were not happy with that ceiling," he said. He said some parts of the elevator lobby were blasted with harsh light, while others were eerily dark.
But as Sumitomo officials investigated, they found that the problems had less to with Noguchi, a noted sculptor who died in 1988, than with the difficulties in maintaining the work in an operating office building.
"It is a maintenance nightmare," said Tatsuru Kono, the president of Sumitomo (NY). "The reason for the glare was that the light bulbs and lenses had been changed over the years. So we went back to the original and tried to get as close to the artist's original intent as possible."
In all, Sumitomo officials said they spent $1.3 million to restore and preserve the Noguchi artworks. The architect for the project was Nobutaka Ashihara, a friend and student of Noguchi's.
When the building opened in 1957 as the Tishman Building -- the current owner more often refers to it by its street address -- the first floor consisted of a mix of stores and open walkways facing Fifth Avenue and the side streets, with the entrance to the offices toward the back of the building.
"The walkways were dark and uninviting spaces," Mr. Bocchi said. "What we had was a midblock lobby for a Fifth Avenue building."
Because of the unusual layout, he said, the building could not command the rent premiums that its prime location would otherwise command. "The building has always done well even in bad economic times," Mr. Bocchi said, "but other buildings have gotten higher rents than ours, even though their location and services are not as good."
The renovation has eliminated the Alitalia ground-floor office, although the airline remains a tenant, and the open walkways. The lobby entrance has been extended to Fifth Avenue, with the fountain visible to visitors as they enter the front door.
The retail space has been extended to the avenue as well, with part of the second floor being removed to accommodate two-story glass windows to display the wares of the two big tenants, the first National Basketball Association store on the south side and Brooks Brothers on the north.
"The building had simply not taken advantage of its retail potential on Fifth Avenue," Mr. Bocchi said. This is not a small point in a part of town where annual retail rents can surpass $500 a square foot.
The two big stores have replaced a jumble of retail spaces that included a bookstore, a jeweler, a clothing store and some snack shops.
The open-air passage from 52d to 53d Street has been enclosed, with revolving doors providing admission to the space. Mr. Kono said it was important to be able to heat and air-condition the lobby of a first-class office building, something that was impossible with the open passages.
(Though some groups have lamented the loss of the passages for midblock transit between the side streets, many people appear to be walking through the enclosed building as they did in the past.)
A subway entrance once reached from the passage has been reoriented and now faces 53d Street. Mr. Kono said transit officials favored the new entrance for security reasons because it has fewer blind turns.
To keep the presentation of the building pristine, Sumitomo officials said they resisted the temptation to put a newsstand or snack bar in the new lobby. But they said one might be installed in the below-ground retail space leading to the subway station; the space already contains a shoe store, a photo shop and a shoe repair store.
On the 40th floor of the building, where the "Top of the Sixes" restaurant was once situated, is now the Grand Havana Room, a cigar bar that also serves lunch and dinner six days a week.
Sumitomo (NY) has owned the building at 666 Fifth Avenue since 1987. Officials said the recent renovation was the first major refit of the building since it opened.

Freeways, Their Costs and 2 Cities' Destinies

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY EGAN 

DATELINE: SALT LAKE CITY

 BODY:
Even a thousand feet above the valley, from the peak where Brigham Young mapped out his Mormon empire in 1847, one of the largest public works projects in the nation dominates the briny expanse of the Great Basin. Two thousand workers are pouring concrete around the clock, turning 6 lanes of Interstate 15 into 12 lanes through Salt Lake City and its loping suburbs.
And no sooner will the $1.6 billion expansion be completed in two years, state officials say, than they will need a new, parallel highway to keep traffic moving along the 100 miles of the Wasatch mountain front, where most of Utah's 2.1 million people live. 
 The Salt Lake metropolitan area is growing by 1,000 acres a month, much of it to the alarm of Utah's political and business leaders. But almost by default, in a blitz of highway construction, the state's leaders are encouraging the very thing they say they do not want: the instant towns of one-acre housing lots and no sidewalks, the car-dependent office parks and big box stores in a sea of pavement, the brown air that obscures the mountains.
More than a thousand miles away, in Milwaukee, a city that expanded along the lines of its highways a generation ago, sledge-hammers of regret will soon begin swinging. The city plans to use more than $20 million in Federal transportation money to tear down a half-built section of highway that was supposed to cut right through old Milwaukee. It will be the nation's largest highway deconstruction project.
"The urban superhighway should be relegated to the scrap heap of history," said John O. Norquist, Milwaukee's three-term Mayor, who toured the country recently to make his case that cities should be removing highways, not building new ones.
There is no greater form of subsidized social engineering than the interstate highway, Mayor Norquist says, which hastens flight out of the city without doing much to ease traffic congestion.
Salt Lake City and Milwaukee, two cities with roughly equal metropolitan populations (about 1.5 million), each having declared war on sprawl, are examples of how Federal transportation subsidies are still one of the biggest forces shaping urban areas.
For all the debate over the quality of life in America's gangly new suburbs, and the effort by such politicians as Vice President Al Gore and Gov. Christine Todd Whitman of New Jersey to make it a national issue, highways can reshape communities in fundamental ways, often with little public comment. These two urban areas are using Federal highway money to go in opposite directions, Salt Lake to speed people into and out of the city, Milwaukee to restore a neighborhood and revive city life.
While Mr. Gore has trumpeted the Clinton Administration's plan to preserve open space with tax credits worth $700 million, the Federal Government is offering cities and states $162 billion over the next five years for building, maintaining and expanding roads. The money is from the largest public works bill ever made law, last year's $217 billion transportation bill.
Much of the money from that bill, after a change in policy under President George Bush in 1991, can be used for commuter rail systems, subways, bike paths, even tearing down highways. But most of it will be used to serve cars. And whether a highway is widened or torn down, aimed at the center of a city or routed around it, it shapes destiny.
In Salt Lake, for example, new subdivisions are already rising in the open spaces through which Gov. Michael O. Leavitt has proposed the building of the Legacy Highway to parallel I-15.
In Milwaukee, a neighborhood of new housing, restaurants, shops and a theme park is taking shape in what will no longer be the path of the Park East Freeway, which it to be demolished. In this case, the market is following the highway's elimination.
 
Utah's Situation
Effects of Zoning And More People
More than most cities in the American West, Salt Lake was carefully planned from inception, its blocks and avenues platted with geometric precision, its neighborhoods zoned to reflect village atmosphere and to enhance the communal economics of the Mormon pioneers.
In some ways the city is still like a big small town. But Salt Lake is on its way to becoming a Phoenix of the Wasatch Range, bordered by new suburbs whose only connection to one another are the highways.
Few people here seem to want this. Governor Leavitt, a two-term Republican, has proclaimed that the Beehive State "will no longer subsidize urban sprawl" -- at least as a deliberate strategy. But indirectly, Utah seems to be doing just that.
New highway projects, combined with local zoning that virtually mandates big lots and big houses, are adding more helium to the balloon of Greater Salt Lake. The metropolitan area is projected to double in size, to more than 800 square miles, by 2020, while the population grows 50 percent. Some people whose lives are in the path of urbanization are bitter at the Government's role.
"We have 300 acres of prime dairy land and there is nothing my family would like better than keep milking cows on this land," said Carolynn Gibson, whose family operates a dairy farm, which began as a homestead, about 30 miles north of Salt Lake City.
But the pressures to sell out are enormous. Hardly a week goes by when the family is not offered a windfall to sell their acreage to a developer.
What has made grazing land look appealing to house builders, driving up property values around the Gibson farm, is Governor Leavitt's proposed Legacy Highway, which would ultimately run more than 100 miles, north and south.
Farmers oppose the highway because it could wipe out up to half of the region's 43 remaining dairy farms. Two Federal agencies also oppose it, saying the highway would cut through what biologists consider some of the most important inland bird breeding grounds in the Western Hemisphere.
"We could make a ton of money and just quit the sweat," Mrs. Gibson said. "But there's something about the sense of it. It makes no sense to keep putting pavement over farmland."
But from his Capitol office in Salt Lake City, Governor Leavitt, a descendant of pioneer stock, looks at a map of the narrow Wasatch front -- mountains on one side, a salty lake or marsh on the other -- and asks, "Where are we going to put all these new people?"
Utah has the nation's highest birth rate, averaging 20 births per 1,000 people in the 1990's, more than double the average. The state is projected to add a million people in the next 20 years, more than 70 percent from births, and two million more by 2050. Dairy farms could be a luxury, the Governor says.
The state's political climate, distrusting anything that smacks of government planning, has made it impossible to pass limits on growth. The Legislature did enact a Quality Growth Act this year, establishing a commission to recommend policies but, as its own preamble says, it "mandates nothing."
Critics of Utah's growth say there is a contradiction: while the Governor says he wants growth to be guided by the free market, his $10 billion in highway construction plans are a giant Government push for growth up and down the Wasatch Range.
"What we have done over the last 50 years with the Federal highway system is subsidize the worst kind of sprawl," said Robert Adler, a professor of law at the University of Utah. "In building these roads, you skew people's choices."
When the Governor invited Utah residents to offer their opinions on growth as part of the Quality Growth process, more than 17,000 people filled out questionnaires. Few responding to the unscientific survey said they wanted to continue in the direction the state was headed, with big lots, no farmland protection and total dependence on cars.
A majority of respondents said they preferred houses on smaller lots, just under a third of an acre, near rail or transit lines, in neighborhoods with a mix of small businesses and town houses. But local zoning codes and the subsidies for new roads make it difficult to create those neighborhoods.
As in most American suburbs, zoning codes in Utah keep businesses apart from housing to protect property values and minimize traffic. One result, though, is that residents are forced into cars for even small errands. And as Salt Lake has grown, many of the small towns in the path of the metropolitan area tried to preserve their rural feel by banning housing lots of less than an acre.
But with one-acre zoning, a million more people, at four per household, would consume most of the open space left in the Salt Lake Valley, according to Envision Utah, a group set up by business and political leaders to guide the state on growth.
"There is a disconnect between cause and effect," said Stephen Holbrook, executive director of the group.
As in many other parts of the country, builders who try to design more compact developments are stymied.
Gerry Tully, a Salt Lake developer, spent years persuading city officials in Farmington, a town of 10,000 people just north of Salt Lake, to let him build 175 homes, including some town houses, on 100 acres with one-acre zoning. Mr. Tully only recently succeeded, after telling residents at several public hearings that the best way to keep some of their open space was to build more compact neighborhoods around parks and green space.
Hugging the bird-congested shore of the Great Salt Lake, Farmington is on the cusp of big change, shaped by the automobile. Signs in front of farms and big new houses protest the Legacy Highway.
State traffic engineers say the number of cars in the metropolitan area will double in 10 years. So even with the interstate widened all the way up to Farmington, Mr. Leavitt said, he has little choice but to build more highway. The state is also building a single-track commuter rail line to the city's downtown sports complex. The rail line is scheduled to open a year before the 2002 Winter Olympics in Utah.
The Salt Lake metropolitan area is following a cycle that is well-known to other cities. Atlanta, after building a ring of highways sliced by other highways, has one of the most traffic-clogged metropolitan areas in the country. The future shape of the Atlanta area may hinge on whether the region decides to go ahead with plans for a new $5 billion outer beltway.
Other cities have turned down plans to widen highways and are rejecting designs for new ones.
Like Utah, Maryland is expected to grow by a million people over the next generation. But that state will no longer finance roads, sewers and other developments that help to expand urban areas into open land.
These limits on growth have their own critics. Some people are denied the American dream of owning their home, these critics say, when restrictions are placed on new highways to the edge of suburbia, where land and housing are cheaper.
"You have some very well-meaning people whose idea of future homes are a bunch of apartment complexes stacked up next to light rail depots," Governor Leavitt said.
 
The Highway
Solution or Problem For Congestion?
Among mayors, traffic engineers and other people who are passionate about urban design's influence on people, there is a vigorous debate over whether building highways causes people to drive more, adding to congestion rather than reducing it.
The arguments boil down to this: When a new road is built, people take trips that they might otherwise not have taken. New homes, businesses and stores brought on by the highway will appear, and it will soon be clogged. But if the crowded highway is removed, or not widened, people will find other ways to get around, taking public transit, side roads, walking or biking -- anything to save time.
Recent studies in England and California support the theory that new roads add to overall driving time, concluding that every 10 percent increase in highway capacity produces at least a 5 percent net increase in driving time.
Supporters of this theory point to San Francisco, where the Embarcadero Freeway along the waterfront, damaged in the 1989 earthquake, was removed; or Portland, Ore., where a six-lane highway was torn down and replaced with a downtown park, or New York, where the West Side Highway was closed after a collapse. In all three cases, traffic in the area of the highway fell when it was taken out of use.
"We have all this experience over the last 20 years, from Los Angeles to Atlanta to Phoenix, that shows that building and widening freeways do not solve our traffic problems," said Keith Bartholomew, a professor at the Wallace Stegner Center for Land, Resources and the Environment at the University of Utah, "and yet here we are in Utah saying somehow this time it has to work."
If the new highway will not reduce traffic, why build it? Governor Leavitt says he has no choice: the millions of new people in Utah will have to get around somehow, and the overwhelming majority of people -- as much as 97 percent, according to some surveys -- will not use mass transit.
Even cities that have embraced rail transit have not noticeably reduced traffic congestion. Americans prefer their cars.
Still, others wonder whether there is a way to accommodate people's preference for the automobile without encouraging a runaway metropolis. A city left to true market forces, not shaped by Government subsidies for either highways or railways, might take an entirely different shape.
Mr. Tully, the Salt Lake developer, says current trends indicate that 70 percent of new housing in the region is likely to be outside the Salt Lake City limits. If the Legacy Highway were not built, he said, it would be closer to 50 percent, because many developers would look at building housing in underused sections of the city. But perhaps the biggest factor driving the housing market is the new freeway, most of which will be underwritten by the Federal Government.
"I would love to have lunch in Paris every day," said Roy Kienitz, executive director of the Surface Transportation Policy Project, a nonprofit study group in Washington. "But I'm not asking the Government to buy me a ticket on the Concorde."
 
Milwaukee's Response
Rejecting Subsidies, Saving Neighborhoods
In Milwaukee, Mayor Norquist has spent more than a decade trying to keep the Federal Government from influencing the place known as Brew City U.S.A. Unlike most Democrats, Mr. Norquist opposes Federal money for housing, highways, education and welfare. The money is virtually free, so cities take it. But they do so at their peril, he argues in his book, "The Wealth of Cities," published last year by Addison-Wesley.
Cities like Detroit, St. Louis and Cleveland lost people and neighborhoods to interstate highways, Mr. Norquist says. In Milwaukee, which is surrounded by highways going every direction, the black section of the city and the old Italian neighborhoods were wiped out by highway construction in the 1960's, he says. Shopping centers and a sizable part of the metropolitan area's people followed the highways west, north and south.
"All this sprawl was subsidized," said Mr. Norquist, sitting in his office in the 105-year-old City Hall, a Flemish Renaissance building topped by a clock tower 400 feet above the sidewalk. "Sprawl is the direct result of accommodating the automobile."
Other urban experts say suburban development is the price for creating the world's first mass middle class. The highway follows public sentiment, they argue.
"You're saying people can go out and have a quarter-acre, half-acre, an acre, build their own house, maybe put a little swimming pool in it, all the things they want, and we call it bad, nasty sprawl," Ben Wattenberg, a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, has written. "Why don't we call it great?"
Mr. Norquist says he is not against all highways, just those that slice up cities. He points to Canada, where its central Government does not pay for urban highways, and cities like Vancouver and Toronto have responded with a mix of transportation systems that preserve their neighborhoods.
Nor is he against the suburbs, where nearly half of Americans now live. But as a big-city mayor, trying to enliven parts of central Milwaukee that once pulsed with commerce and housing, Mr. Norquist has a natural bias.
A final link in the long-term highway plan for Milwaukee called for the Park East Freeway to cut across the northern edge of downtown, across the Milwaukee River to Lake Michigan. While the part that was built is still in use, neighborhood opposition killed construction of the second half, and now the Mayor has obtained money to tear down the part that was built.
The Mayor views what has happened since the highway was halted as a sort of laboratory for his theory that cities will develop naturally without Federal highway subsidies. At the point where the highway was brought to a standstill, a cluster of new housing has arisen, in a neighborhood that includes John Ernst Cafe, Milwaukee's oldest German restaurant. Children ride bikes with cards pinned to the wheels for motorized effect, the elderly play chess in a new pocket park and people carry groceries home from a supermarket at the center of East Pointe Commons housing development.
It is the kind of neighborhood favored by the so-called New Urbanists, a group of architects, planners and others who advocate more compact development. The neighborhood is not for everybody, says Mayor Norquist, but by stopping the highway the city has allowed people to make a choice. There is no subsidy either way.
As the highways carried people away from the city, the new suburbs have tended to zone out the kind of things that make a neighborhood interesting, Mr. Norquist said, echoing the sentiments of Mr. Tully in Utah. Mr. Norquist points to cozy old streets in Milwaukee, where people live in apartments that are directly above storefronts, and walk to schools and businesses.

HEADLINE: Report Says Profit-Making Health Plans Damage Care

BYLINE: By SHERYL GAY STOLBERG 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 13

 BODY:
Patients enrolled in profit-making health insurance plans are significantly less likely to receive the basics of good medical care -- including childhood immunizations, routine mammograms, pap smears, prenatal care, and lifesaving drugs after a heart attack -- than those in not-for-profit plans, says a new study that concludes that the free market is "compromising the quality of care."
The research, by a team from Harvard University and Public Citizen, an advocacy group in Washington, is the first comprehensive comparison of investor-owned and nonprofit plans. The authors found that on every one of 14 quality-of-care indicators, the for-profits scored worse. But because the researchers favored national health insurance, some questioned their findings. 
 "The market is destroying our health care system," Dr. David U. Himmelstein, associate professor of medicine at Harvard University Medical School and the study's lead author, said in a telephone interview. "We have had a decade or more of policies aimed at making health care a business, and they have failed."
Investor-owned health plans, which are typically made up of loose networks of doctors, have come to dominate the American medical landscape in recent years. These plans, offered by companies like Aetna, U.S. Healthcare and Cigna Healthcare, last year covered 62 percent of all patients in H.M.O.'s, as compared to 26 percent in 1985. Yet most research on quality of care in H.M.O.'s has focused on traditional nonprofits, among them Kaiser Permanente, in California, and H.I.P., based in New York.
The new study, which appears this week in the Journal of the American Medical Association, analyzed quality-of-care data from 248 investor-owned and 81 not-for-profit plans in 45 states and the District of Columbia. These plans provided coverage to 56 percent of all Americans enrolled in H.M.O.'s in 1996, the year from which the patient information was drawn.
Among the findings: In profit-making H.M.O.'s just 63.9 percent of 2-year-olds were fully immunized, as compared to 72.3 percent in nonprofits. Lifesaving beta-blocker drugs were given to 59.2 percent of heart attack patients in for-profit plans, but 70.6 percent of patients in nonprofits got the drugs. Diabetes patients were less likely to receive annual eye exams to prevent blindness in profit-making plans; the figure was 35.1 percent, as against 47.9 percent in nonprofits.
The investor-owned plans fared worse, the authors said, even when all other factors, like location of the plan, and whether the doctors were employees or members of networks, were taken into account. While the study had certain limitations -- it did not examine how patients fared, for instance -- the authors, who paid for the research themselves, said the data were the best available.
The study is being published just as the Senate is embroiled in a divisive debate over how to protect patients' rights and regulate H.M.O.'s. While the authors say the timing is coincidental, the work is already influencing the discussion. In a statement released today, Senator Edward M. Kennedy, the Massachussetts Democrat who is pushing for H.M.O. regulation, said the research "contains strong new support for H.M.O. reform."
But representatives of the insurance industry, which opposes regulation, argue just the opposite. They say the study demonstrates that, even at their worst, health maintenance organizations provide better care to patients than fee-for-service arrangements that were common 10 years ago.
"The best conclusion that can be drawn from this study is that managed care is improving the quality of health care for those Americans that are covered by health plans," said Susan Pisano, a spokeswoman for the American Association of Health Plans, which represents both for-profit and nonprofit plans.
Ms. Pisano also accused the authors of confusing "analysis and ideology."
Dr. Himmelstein did not dispute that he had a bias. "My bias is that for-profit H.M.O.'s kill people," he said.
But Eli Ginzberg, a health care economist at Columbia University who did not participate in the study , said Dr. Himmelstein's political views did not discredit the Harvard professor's work.
"There is no question that he has an agenda, but I think he is reading his data correctly," said Professor Ginzberg, adding that it was hardly surprising that nonprofit plans deliver better care. "Let's face it, people went into the for-profit managed care business to make bucks," he said. The study was made public here today at the offices of Public Citizen, whose director, Dr. Sidney M. Wolfe, was a co-author.

HEADLINE: Bush Tells New Jersey 'Compassionate Conservatism' Is Nation's Best Hope

BYLINE: By DAVID KOCIENIEWSKI 

DATELINE: NEWARK, July 13

 BODY:
Gov. George W. Bush brought his high-rolling Presidential campaign to New Jersey for the first time this evening, telling a roomful of Republican campaign contributors that his brand of "compassionate conservatism" is the best hope for continuing the nation's prosperity while strengthening its moral character.
At a fund-raising dinner held at the Sheraton hotel next to Newark International Airport, Mr. Bush delivered his standard campaign speech about tax cuts and the importance of personal responsibility, making scant reference to New Jersey or issues affecting urban areas like Newark. He spoke briefly with reporters and declined to say whether his campaign, which had raised a record $36.3 million by July 1, will refuse Federal matching funds. Such a move would give Mr. Bush more flexibility in his campaign spending. 
 Although some supporters conceded that Mr. Bush's message was short on specifics, many said they were optimistic that his charm, conviction and ideals would play well with New Jersey's moderate Republican voters.
"He talked about his ideas," said Irene G. Almeida, chairman of the Passaic Valley Sewerage Commissioners, who attended a private roundtable discussion between Mr. Bush and an assortment of Republican officials before the dinner. "He didn't go into details, but those will come later. The good thing is to see how he talks to people, his warmth. And that he really seems to believe deeply in what he's saying. You can just see it in the way he talks."
Mr. Bush, who flew in from Austin, Tex., also had reason to feel upbeat. Clifford M. Sobel, the finance chairman of the New Jersey Republican Party, announced that the event raised $1 million, meaning that Mr. Bush has now raised more money in the state than any other candidate -- including Bill Bradley, the Democratic Presidential hopeful and former United States Senator who lives in Montclair. About 500 people paid at least $1,000 each to attend the dinner.
Although the first Presidential primaries are still half a year away, Mr. Bush has become a daunting front-runner for the Republican nomination and the list of his supporters at the event today included most of the prominent New Jersey Republicans.
The co-chairmen of the event were Donald T. DiFrancesco, Speaker of the State Senate, and Jack Collins, Speaker of the Assembly. Gov. Christine Todd Whitman, who has said she will not endorse a Presidential candidate until after this November's elections, met privately with Mr. Bush before he made his speech, and many of her cabinet members and campaign officials attended the event.
During his half-hour address, Mr. Bush spoke about his desire to spread the nation's prosperity and reach out to the poor. He also vowed to make public education a priority, and pointed to his success in improving the test scores of Texas students during his five years as Governor.
But the biggest applause came when Mr. Bush made a reference to President Clinton's impeachment and the Monica Lewinsky scandal.
"When I put my hand on the Bible, I'll swear to uphold the dignity of the office," he said.
Outside the hotel, Mr. Bush was greeted by a small group of demonstrators from the gun control group Ceasefire New Jersey, who protested his opposition to several proposals to limit the sale of handguns.
When questioned by reporters, Mr. Bush defended his record of supporting gun owners' rights and said he did not think it would hurt his prospects in states like New Jersey, where public opinion polls show that a majority of voters embrace gun control.
"That's what elections are for," he said. "But I'm proud of my record."

HEADLINE: Hotel Chains Improved Their Hiring, the N.A.A.C.P. Says

BYLINE: By WINNIE HU 

 BODY:
The nation's largest hotel chains improved in hiring minority workers and reaching out to minority businesses and consumers last year, according to an annual survey conducted by the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People.
Kweisi Mfume, president of the association, unveiled a "report card" for hotels and a separate one for telecommunications companies yesterday afternoon at the group's annual convention at the New York Hilton and Towers in midtown Manhattan. 
 "We believe, quite frankly, that unless communities of color become disciplined consumers, we run the risk of still sitting like beggars on bags of gold, looking at the lack of reciprocity in our communities, and continuing to see trade as a one-way street," he said.
Both surveys were based on information provided by the companies in five areas: hiring of minority workers, promotion of minority employees, relationships with businesses owned by members of minorities, advertising in black media outlets and philanthropy in minority communities.
Marriott topped the list of 14 companies in the hotel survey, getting a B+ (and a numerical grade of 3.7), followed by the economy chain Cendant (B+ and 3.56), whose properties include Days Inn, Howard Johnson and Super 8 Motels. The Hilton chain ranked third with a B.
"We're No. 1 and we intend to stay there," said Dave Sampson, vice president for diversity projects at Marriott International. The company was handing out announcements saying Marriott was the "highest-rated hotel company" in the survey. Last year, Marriott was given a C+.
Mr. Sampson oversees a department that was created 18 months ago to recruit small service-providing businesses owned by women and by members of minorities. So far, his department has contacted about 200 such companies and signed about 20 to contracts.
In contrast to the two earlier hotel surveys, none of the companies received a failing grade this year. But four -- Bass/Holiday (which includes Holiday Inn) Wyndham, Starwood (Westin, ITT Sheraton) and Omni -- came in at the bottom with a grade of C.
Gloria Rogers, 57, a delegate, said she took the report cards seriously and would avoid hotels that had low grades. "If you walk into a hotel that's all white, you're not going to feel as welcome and accepted, and you will be neglected," she said. "So to us, this is very important."
In the telecommunications survey, Bell South received the highest grade of B+ (numerical grade 3.55), followed by Bell Atlantic, the largest phone service provider in New York, with a B+ and 3.5. The only failing grade went to Alltel, because it did not respond to requests for information, said Linda Haithcox, national manager of economic development for the N.A.A.C.P.
This was only the second year for the telecommunications survey, and Mr. Mfume said that it was too soon to see any improvements. But he urged the delegates not to patronize companies that had a D or a failing grade.
Like report cards from school, the highest grade is an A, but Ms. Haithcox said that no company has yet received it. "If they deserve an A, they will get it," she said.
Several representatives of companies ranked in the N.A.A.C.P. report cards attended yesterday's presentation and most emphasized that their companies had made long-term commitments to diversity that would not change because of the report cards.
Mark Bonavia, a director of corporate communications for Sprint, said his company had made many improvements even though it received a C grade for the second year. For instance, he said, Sprint has made a point of recruiting at historically black colleges like Howard University in Washington and Florida A &M University in Tallahassee. Last year, about 20 percent of the company's 12,000 new employees were black.
In addition, Mr. Bonavia said, Sprint spent $8.14 million in 1998 for advertising in magazines, newspapers and television stations that cater to blacks, but $1.45 million the year before.
"Despite the fact that we made colossal progress year to year on paper and in practice, you really can't step up your diversity efforts on multiple fronts because you want to improve your grade or a rating," he said. "You do it because it makes your business better."

Unemployment Rate Rises in New Jersey

BYLINE: AP 

 BODY:
New Jersey's unemployment rate crept up again in June to its highest level since the end of 1997. But the 4.9 percent rate is still considered near full employment for the Garden State, State Labor Department officials said yesterday.
Unemployment rose slightly from 4.7 percent rate in May. The New Jersey rate has risen since sinking to 4.1 percent in February. 
 The indicators were mixed: New Jersey employers continued to create more jobs, but fewer New Jersey residents held jobs during the month.
The State Labor Commissioner, Mel Gelade, said the higher rate did not concern him because so many other economic factors in New Jersey remained strong. He noted that New Jersey employers created 1,600 more jobs during the month. Mr. Gelade added, however, that there would be concern if the state rate continued to rise the rest of the year.

HEADLINE: Asia's Future, and Ours

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Not only has the rebound in Asia derailed reform (front page, July 12), but a return to rapid growth in the region will also renew the threat of environmental meltdown. 
 At 8 percent growth, 80 percent of the industrial sector in Asia in just 25 years will consist of plants not yet built. It is expected that more than 60 percent of world income will originate in Asia by 2025. And it is projected that up to 400 million people will be added to the region.
It is the momentum of these forces, not just the numbers, that suggests that the world's environmental future will be determined in large measure by what happens in Asia. If concern for the environment is made part of economic reform, the prospects are bright. If not, the Asian rebound will be a problem for all of us.

HEADLINE: SUNY Woos Harlem Pastor To Lead Nassau Campus

BYLINE: By KAREN W. ARENSON 

 BODY:
Several top officials at the State University of New York are pressing the Rev. Calvin O. Butts 3d, pastor of the Abyssinian Baptist Church in Harlem, to become president of SUNY's Old Westbury campus, and he has indicated his strong interest.
"I hope we will be able to convince him to come and lead our institution," Thomas F. Egan, SUNY's chairman, said yesterday in a statement. 
 Under SUNY rules, a search committee must be formed to propose candidates, whose names will be forwarded to the trustees, but Mr. Egan and other SUNY officials said they considered Mr. Butts, 49, to be the leading candidate. "He is an extremely gifted and outstanding individual with the strongest leadership qualities," Mr. Egan said.
Mr. Butts said last night that if offered the position, he would be "excited about taking it."
But referring to the search process, he said: "Right now, I don't think it's a matter of me making up my mind. It's a matter of whether a formal invitation will be made. If they asked me tomorrow, I would say yes. I am excited about it. It would be a great challenge for the 21st century. There are no more important things than education and faith."
William R. Howell, a businessman who is chairman of the search committee and of the college's advisory council, said last night that while he had met with Mr. Butts informally, the search committee would not hold its first meeting until the end of this month and that he intended to conduct a full search.
A SUNY official said the position of president pays between $120,000 and $150,000.
SUNY's Old Westbury campus is about 20 miles from Manhattan in Nassau County, and about half of its approximately 3,700 students are members of minority groups. SUNY officials say the college has suffered from weak leadership and years of sparse funding by SUNY.
Mr. Butts's interest in Old Westbury is said to have grown out of discussions he had with Randy Daniels, a SUNY trustee, about wanting to teach a college course, and being referred to the Long Island campus.
SUNY officials say they began talking to Mr. Butts after he visited the Old Westbury campus earlier this year to discuss the possibility of teaching a course as an adjunct professor, and became intrigued with the idea of becoming more involved with the college.
Academia would mark a sudden turn for Mr. Butts, who has been with the Abyssinian Baptist Church since 1972 and for more than a decade has toyed with the idea of entering politics. Earlier this year, he said he might be interested in running for mayor of New York in 2001 or for the United States Congress in 2000.
Mr. Butts said accepting the Old Westbury position "would obviously take me out of the running for anything."
That "doesn't mean I would not be involved in politics," he added. "I will certainly have my own opinions. I intend to be fully politically involved in what goes on in the city and state."
Once the ultimate outsider who criticized mainstream politicians on issues of race, in recent years Mr. Butts has developed close ties to the business community and to political officials as he sought to nurture economic development in Harlem.
He may have distanced himself from some potential allies last year, when -- to the consternation of many of New York's black leaders -- he endorsed Gov. George E. Pataki in his bid for re-election.
Mr. Butts said last year that the Governor had been helpful in providing money to support development in Harlem, and he has also led prayer breakfasts for Mr. Pataki, who is close to several of the SUNY trustees who are backing Mr. Butts.
In April, Mr. Butts was attacked in the black press and on black talk-radio programs for reaching out to Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani in the wake of the fatal shooting of Amadou Diallo by police officers in the Bronx.
Founded 31 years ago as a college dedicated to serving "nontraditional students," including adults and high school students who were not well prepared for college, Old Westbury has been criticized in recent years for being one of SUNY's least selective four-year colleges.
Last year, SUNY trustees brought in Dr. W. Hubert Keen, a biologist who had been provost at the City University of New York's York College, as interim president, to try to transform the campus.
SUNY officials yesterday gave him credit for introducing great change in a short period, but said that it was not clear whether Dr. Keen planned to seek the post of permanent president.

HEADLINE: Would Tax Cuts Prove Too Stimulating?

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE

 BODY:
For all the recent talk of cutting taxes, Congress rarely cuts them when the economy is growing robustly, as it is today, and unemployment is low. The worry among economists is that the extra money in people's pockets may make an already strong economy too strong, finally stoking inflation after a long period of relatively stable prices.
Yet that danger is hardly mentioned in the rising public debate over the Republican and Democratic proposals for tax cuts. 
 Why not? In part, it is because the advocates of the tax cuts, as well as many of the opponents, agree that any reductions will probably be small, at least in the initial years. And few analysts expect any final tax cut to come close to the $864 billion over the next decade that has been proposed by House Republicans.
"Most of the tax cut proposals are phased in gradually over a number of years," said Senator Connie Mack, Republican of Florida, the chairman of Congress's Joint Economic Committee and the author of a proposal to cut taxes by $137 billion over 10 years, most of it toward the end of the period. "I think the immediate economic stimulus will be small," he said.
The Federal Reserve, however, is concerned. "If taxes were cut while the nation's resources are highly employed, that would put more pressure on monetary policy," Edward M. Gramlich, a Fed governor, said. He suggested, in effect, that the Fed might have to raise interest rates to prevent the extra spending that would overstimulate the economy. Others worry that the higher rates might reduce investment or bring down inflated stock prices, damaging the economy through these avenues.
Stock prices should already be reacting to the prospect of a tax cut, some people say, but they have not so far because too many people on Wall Street express doubt that tax cut legislation will be enacted before next year's election -- or soon afterward, for that matter.
"A bunch of friends on Wall Street have asked me why the markets are so quiet about the tax cut proposals," said James E. Glassman, a senior economist at Chase Manhattan Bank. "Wall Street is unusually quiet because it realizes that there will just be gridlock on this issue near term -- a lot of proposals and no real action."
Still, Mr. Gramlich's concern reflects a view widely shared among economists -- that broad tax cuts tend to stimulate spending and therefore should be reserved for recessions or periods of slow growth. In the early 1960's, President John F. Kennedy proposed a tax cut in this spirit, and President Ronald Reagan's tax cuts, which started during a recession, contributed to the long expansion in the 1980's.
By contrast, President Lyndon B. Johnson's 10 percent income tax cut, carrying through on the original Kennedy proposal, came when the economy had turned from the weak Kennedy years to the much more robust mid-1960's. The Fed responded by raising rates.
And the altered mix was damaging, says Alan S. Blinder, a Princeton University economist who served as Fed vice chairman from 1994 to 1996. The new mix -- higher interest rates to offset more fiscal stimulus from the tax cut and from stepped-up spending for the Vietnam War and for the Johnson social programs -- shifted the economy toward consumption and away from investment. Inflation also got a foothold.
Some economists contend that fiscal policy has lost its punch since the 1960's while monetary policy has evolved to the point that the Fed can regulate the economy through interest rate adjustments, offsetting tax cuts without damage.
"Monetary policy administered by the Fed is far more important as far as economic stabilization is concerned and regulating aggregate demand," said James Gwertney, the Republican-appointed chief economist of the Joint Economic panel.
Mr. Blinder disagrees. Monetary policy has its limits, he said. A tax cut offset by higher interest rates today "would reverse the policy mix that we have followed in the 1990's with such splendid effect: low interest rates and high corporate investment," Mr. Blinder said.
Henry Kaufman, a Wall Street economist and consultant, adds a related reason for not using the budget surplus to finance tax cuts, as both parties now propose. "With the surplus, we could have some timely fiscal action when the economy goes inevitably into recession," he said. "We would not for once have to worry about deficit financing."
Clinton Administration officials say that their more modest tax cut proposal gets around the problem of encouraging too much consumption. By offering incentives, particularly to the poor, to invest the tax cuts in retirement accounts, they say, private savings will rise, and the savings will then be available for corporations to borrow and invest in productive equipment.
But many economists say that such tax rebates would not go dollar for dollar into retirement accounts. Upper-income people in particular have the wherewithal to shift savings from one account to another to qualify for a tax refund, which would then be spent on consumer goods, according to this view. That has been the experience with individual retirement accounts.
This is not the supply-side view. For supply-siders, tax cuts -- particularly a Republican proposal to reduce the capital gains tax on the profit made from the sale of stocks and other assets -- encourage investment by reducing its risk. While supply-siders are a distinct minority among economists, they are a vocal one in the incipient debate about a tax cut's effect on the economy.
In their view, suppliers, not consumers, are the chief economic actors. And suppliers respond to tax cuts by investing their capital in new supply. Far from stimulating demand beyond an economy's capacity, the supply-siders say, a tax cut increases the supply of goods and services, which are then consumed.
No one pushes this view harder than Jude Wanniski, an economics consultant and adviser to Steve Forbes and various other Republicans involved in tax-cutting proposals. "The Government, by cutting tax rates, is simply removing the barrier to investment," he said.

HEADLINE: Would Tax Cuts Prove Too Stimulating?

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE

 BODY:
For all the recent talk of cutting taxes, Congress rarely cuts them when the economy is growing robustly, as it is today, and unemployment is low. The worry among economists is that the extra money in people's pockets may make an already strong economy too strong, finally stoking inflation after a long period of relatively stable prices.
Yet that danger is hardly mentioned in the rising public debate over the Republican and Democratic proposals for tax cuts. 
 Why not? In part, it is because the advocates of the tax cuts, as well as many of the opponents, agree that any reductions will probably be small, at least in the initial years. And few analysts expect any final tax cut to come close to the $864 billion over the next decade that has been proposed by House Republicans.
"Most of the tax cut proposals are phased in gradually over a number of years," said Senator Connie Mack, Republican of Florida, the chairman of Congress's Joint Economic Committee and the author of a proposal to cut taxes by $137 billion over 10 years, most of it toward the end of the period. "I think the immediate economic stimulus will be small," he said.
The Federal Reserve, however, is concerned. "If taxes were cut while the nation's resources are highly employed, that would put more pressure on monetary policy," Edward M. Gramlich, a Fed governor, said. He suggested, in effect, that the Fed might have to raise interest rates to prevent the extra spending that would overstimulate the economy. Others worry that the higher rates might reduce investment or bring down inflated stock prices, damaging the economy through these avenues.
Stock prices should already be reacting to the prospect of a tax cut, some people say, but they have not so far because too many people on Wall Street express doubt that tax cut legislation will be enacted before next year's election -- or soon afterward, for that matter.
"A bunch of friends on Wall Street have asked me why the markets are so quiet about the tax cut proposals," said James E. Glassman, a senior economist at Chase Manhattan Bank.

HEADLINE: BOOKS OF THE TIMES;
Construing His Airness As a Neo-Imperialist

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER LEHMANN-HAUPT 

 BODY:

MICHAEL JORDAN AND THE NEW GLOBAL CAPITALISM
By Walter LaFeber
Illustrated. 191 pages. W. W. Norton & Company $22.95.
It is not exactly news that Michael Jordan may well be one of the most familiar figures in the world today. As arguably the greatest basketball player ever to play the game and as a pitchman for products ranging from Nike sportswear to McDonald's fast food, Mr. Jordan has become as recognizable to natives of Lhasa, Tibet, and students at Beijing University as he is to hometown fans of the Chicago Bulls. 
 Yet Walter LaFeber, a history professor at Cornell University, is out to make a larger point in his catchily titled new book, "Michael Jordan and the New Global Capitalism." Arguing that Mr. Jordan represents a new form of culture that is sweeping the globe and changing ways of life everywhere for good or ill, Mr. LaFeber poses the question: Is Mr. Jordan simply a great salesman or does he represent what some see as an insidious form of cultural imperialism? If the answer is the latter, what are the implications for America's relations to the world?
The prospect of getting answers to these questions is intriguing enough to draw the reader through much material familiar to any basketball fan or reader of the financial pages. Mr. LaFeber begins by tracing Mr. Jordan's roots, emphasizing his atypical background (for an African-American ballplayer) of having grown up in a rural area relatively innocent of race prejudice and the civil rights struggles of the 1960's.
The book's focus then turns to the history of basketball since its invention by Dr. James Naismith in 1891 as a pastime for keeping the young men at Springfield College in Massachusetts out of trouble between the football and baseball seasons.
Conceding that within decades the game became the special preserve of blacks in the inner city (especially New York), Mr. LaFeber nevertheless stresses how quickly basketball caught on with women (in 1896, the women of Stanford defeated Berkeley 2 to 1 -- each basket counting a point -- in a game watched by hundreds of female fans), how soon it became internationally popular and how well it lent itself to broadcasting on television.
With Mr. Jordan's entry into the National Basketball Association in 1984 (as the third pick in the annual draft of college players after the Houston Rockets took Hakeem Olajuwan and the Portland Trailblazers selected the now forgotten Sam Bowie), several synergistic forces came together, Mr. LaFeber argues. Mr. Jordan himself quickly developed into both a peerless player and an appealing spokesman for commercial products.
The new commissioner of the N.B.A., David Stern, introduced innovative policies that allowed professional basketball to begin its leap to international prominence. New communications technology permitted television to provide the medium to broadcast that leap. And the Nike corporation, led by Phil Knight, established itself as a paradigm of the modern transnational company, the distinguishing characteristics of which are to depend largely on overseas production, to be knowledge-based rather than reliant on industrial goods, to look to the world instead of just the United States for profits, to be driven by large-scale advertising campaigns carried by the new communications technology and to lie beyond the control of any single government.
What the synergy of these forces produced, writes Mr. LaFeber, was called "soft power," referring to "the influence of U.S. culture and commerce, rather than to its military and political muscle." The author continues: "Transnationals such as Nike epitomized such soft power. Their influence was made greater by widespread use of the English language -- the international language of computers, science and many of the young who considered themselves 'cool.' "
"Recent students of 'post-imperialism' ," he goes on, "argue that transnational corporations have created in many nations a new class -- a native 'nationalist managerial' class -- which works to help the transnational spread its power among people of whom this new class is a part." He concludes: "This post-1970's class can provide a vital support on the important local political level for transnationals. The new corporations thus not only change buying habits in a society, but modify the composition of the society itself. For the society that receives it, soft power can have hard effects."
Do all of Mr. LaFeber's points connect to form a picture of the future of the global economy? Not really. For one thing, the book is more about Mr. Jordan than the effects of what he has done. We learn much about his suffering from having struck a "Faustian bargain" with the media, but not very much about why precisely his image has proved so appealing. (The author barely mentions perhaps the most striking feature about Mr. Jordan, not his airness, but instead that he's hairless.)
When Mr. LaFeber does explore how Mr. Jordan and Nike operate, he fails to examine in detail the implications of the low wages the company is accused of paying to foreign workers, or the extent of its mass cultural influence. One wonders what will happen when the supply of cheap labor dries up, as it is bound to do if, as Nike representatives have argued, its influence in poor countries has helped to create a middle class. One wonders too if the mass culture that transnationals are accused of spreading can't be resisted by advocates of high culture, just as it continues to be here in the United States.
Finally, on the question of whether Mr. Jordan is good or bad for the world, Mr. LaFeber cops out. He cites a few trivial examples on both sides. He then concludes somewhat lamely: "In the new tightly wired world, Americans cannot escape these questions" of whether global capitalism is benign or evil. "They can only begin to deal with them by understanding the history of how we all became part of a global market economy and market society." Presumably he has written a piece of that history. But it doesn't provide very many answers.

HEADLINE: The Volatile Issue of Taiwan

 BODY:
By most measures of civic development, Taiwan has evolved in recent years into a far more appealing model than mainland China. Taiwan's politics is now fully democratic, its economy market-based and thriving and its press free and spirited. But relations between Taiwan and the mainland remain as tense and explosive as ever, and each side takes every opportunity to provoke the other. The latest dispute was set off when Taiwan's President, Lee Teng-hui, abruptly announced a new definition of Taiwan's status, needlessly angering Beijing and complicating relations between the United States and China.
In a radio interview last weekend, Mr. Lee asserted that Taiwan and China were, at least for now, two separate states. That cast aside the traditional and usefully ambiguous formula of "one China." That doctrine, adopted by Washington and Beijing when they began serious diplomatic courtship in 1972, affirms that "there is but one China and Taiwan is part of China." In practical terms, it means that Washington has committed itself not to recognize Taiwan as an independent state. 
 The merit of this formula is that it allows Taiwan and the mainland to coexist as separate political entities so long as both acknowledge a commitment to eventual reunification. Mr. Lee has not only challenged that status quo, but has virtually asserted Taiwan's independence. As he surely knew it would, his statement struck a nationalist nerve among mainland Chinese, stirring sentiments that the Communist leadership there has always been quick to exploit.
The combustibility of this issue should not be underestimated. Four years ago tensions increased after Mr. Lee exploited a private visa to attend a Cornell reunion to promote his vision of a more assertive Taiwan. Beijing, accusing Washington of going back on its earlier commitments, chilled relations with the United States. Several months later Beijing conducted missile tests and war games near Taiwan during the island's 1996 presidential election campaign.
Beijing should not make the same mistake of resorting to military threats. That bullying turned Taiwanese opinion sharply against the mainland and reunification. Mr. Lee, for his part, should abandon talk of separate states and instead reaffirm Taiwan's desire for eventual peaceful reunification on terms consistent with its current freedoms.
The United States, meanwhile, should try to stay out of the public crossfire while counseling restraint to both sides. In particular, Washington should make sure Mr. Lee clearly understands that while Americans support Taiwan's democracy, the United States believes the island's future is ill served by needless confrontations with Beijing.

HEADLINE: Buying Spree And Inflation Hold Course

BYLINE: By SYLVIA NASAR 

 BODY:
Everybody from the Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan, to the vacationing teacher with a 401(k) has been wondering lately how long the good times can last before inflation returns.
A while longer, it appears. According to data released yesterday by the Government, American consumers may have moderated their spending but are still on a buying spree. And prices, at least on the wholesale level, are still going nowhere. 
 Sales by stores, gas stations, car dealerships, restaurants and mail-order outlets -- which account for roughly 40 percent of what American consumers spend -- were up one-tenth of 1 percent last month. The gain came on top of increases in the previous two months that turned out to be even bigger than initially reported.
Retail sales other than cars and light trucks, which dipped after an enormous bulge in May, were up nearly half a percent, about as much as the month before.
At the same time, producer prices for finished goods fell one-tenth of a percent, the Labor Department reported. And to the surprise of most forecasters, who had been expecting a small increase in the "core" inflation rate, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, the index fell instead by two-tenths of a percent.
"What we've got is so much spending, so little inflation," said John Lonski, chief economist at Moody's Investor Service.
Despite the good news on inflation, the bond market fell slightly yesterday, apparently on worries that increases in commodity prices at earlier stages in the production pipeline may eventually lead to higher prices for finished goods. But there are several reasons to discount those fears, at least for now.
One month's numbers are never more than a tiny, and often unreliable, clue to the big picture. But the contrast between sales and prices is enough to produce profound cognitive dissonance.
Last quarter, sales at auto dealerships were up more than 8 percent from a year ago, but wholesale prices for passenger cars fell 1.3 percent last month. The nation's roads are jammed with sport utility vehicles, vans, pickups and other gas guzzlers, but gasoline prices dropped three-tenths of a percent. Appliance sales have been soaring in a hot housing market, but wholesale prices for dishwashers, dryers and the like were down six-tenths of a percent.
What's going on? Even though demand for everything from cellular phones to fall clothes is growing rapidly, so, apparently, is supply. And that means that many companies are in no position to take advantage of the situation by raising prices.
"The nearly unmatched vigor of consumer spending hasn't done much for the pricing power of American companies," Mr. Lonski said. "There's more than enough supply to meet the demand."
Not only is lingering weakness abroad producing a gusher of inexpensive imports, but the United States is awash in retail outlets, and more megastores and megamalls are being built to add to the already Darwinian competition among retailers.
The final verdict on inflation is never in, of course. The most important measure of inflation in June -- the Consumer Price Index, which covers services like health care, utilities, rent and education as well as items that people buy in stores -- is not due out until today.
Moreover, the few disquieting notes in the wholesale price report that were spotted by the bond market bear watching. In particular, prices for raw materials -- which include crude oil, ore and scrap, grain and the like -- were up, reflecting the world economy's becoming a bit firmer. And prices for intermediate goods like metals, plastics and chemicals jumped nearly half a percent in June. Indeed, after falling for 10 consecutive months through February, raw materials prices have been rising for the last four months.
"There's a clear inflection point," said William Dudley, chief economist at Goldman, Sachs.
Still, raw and even intermediate goods are only the beginning of a long chain that stretches from mines, farms and oilfields all the way to gas pumps and grocery stores. The critical question is whether companies at the end closest to the consumer can pass along higher input prices, or whether they will have to absorb them by holding the line elsewhere or taking lower profits.
"That depends on what happens to other costs," said Richard Rippe, chief economist at Prudential Securities. And so far they have been restrained. Pay increases, Mr. Rippe points out, have actually been a bit less generous in recent months. Productivity gains, meanwhile, have been strong. As a result, unit labor costs have been rising at an annual rate of less than 1 percent in non-financial corporations. At the same time, costs related to capital -- interest, depreciation and indirect business taxes -- have been falling.
Consumers, meanwhile, show few signs of flagging. Consumer spending has slowed since last winter, when it was growing at an annual rate of nearly 7 percent, but it has not slowed very much, only to about 4 percent. By any historical yardstick, that is still pretty rich.
Consumers are confident enough to spend plenty of time at the malls because jobs are plentiful. And with a record fraction of the population working, total wage and salary income rose to more than $4 trillion in 1998. Even more remarkable, household net worth grew more than $3 trillion last year.
The gains have kept coming. The latest reading for after-tax personal income shows that it is almost 4 percent higher than a year ago. And that is above and beyond inflation.
In short, not much is happening to discourage Americans from their favorite recreation. That is sure to keep Mr. Greenspan and everyone else scanning the inflation numbers anxiously for hints that things are not really as good as they look today.

HEADLINE: Increase in Ford's Earnings Tops Wall Street Estimates

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER 

DATELINE: DEARBORN, Mich., July 14

 BODY:
The American automobile market, widely dismissed a few years ago as too competitive and glutted to be profitable, carried the Ford Motor Company to earnings that were better than expected in the second quarter. Strong United States sales of high-profit sport utility vehicles and pickup trucks offset losses in South America and deteriorating results in Europe.
A $146 million one-time charge related to Ford's acquisition of Volvo's car making operations in March depressed earnings, which fell 1.8 percent from a year earlier, to $2.34 billion, or $1.89 per share. This was 4 cents better than the consensus estimate of Wall Street analysts, according to First Call. 
 Excluding the one-time charge, Ford's profits climbed to a record $2.48 billion, or $2 a share, from $2.38 billion, or $1.91 a share.
Wayne Booker, Ford's vice chairman and chief financial officer, predicted the good times would continue in the company's core American market. "I don't foresee a major decrease in demand taking place," he said.
Despite the positive results, Ford shares fell 56.25 cents, to $52.9375 on the New York Stock Exchange. The shares have suffered in recent months as higher interest rates have caused investors to worry that cars might become less affordable.
Ford's second-quarter sales rose 13.4 percent, to $42.28 billion from $37.3 billion, mainly because of the $6.5 billion Volvo acquisition but also because of rising sales of its own brands. The gain appeared large enough to make Ford bigger than DaimlerChrysler A.G. but not big enough to displace General Motors as the world's largest corporation in terms of sales.
This week's issue of Fortune magazine ranked G.M. first on its Global 500 list, followed by DaimlerChrysler and then Ford. But the rankings included the merger of Daimler-Benz and the Chrysler Corporation, which took place in November, but not the Ford acquisition of Volvo cars, which was concluded in March.
G.M. spun off its auto parts unit, Delphi Automotive Systems, in late May, which will shave its annual revenues by about $6 billion. But crippling strikes a year ago in Flint, Mich., cost the company up to $10 billion in sales, and labor experts predict that experience will not be repeated this year, allowing G.M.'s sales to rebound.
With G.M. scheduled to release its second-quarter figures next Tuesday, its officials declined to discuss today which company was bigger.
Ford has been reviewing for more than a year how it might spin off its automotive parts business, Visteon Automotive Systems. The company has not made any decisions, partly because it is negotiating a new national labor contract; the United Automobile Workers union's contracts with Ford, G.M. and DaimlerChrysler expire on Sept. 14.
"We have several alternatives on Visteon, and we haven't decided on any direction yet," Mr. Booker said in an interview today, adding that, "We believe we have some time to sort out what is the best alternative, whether it's continue as it is, a partial spinoff or some other alternative."
Visteon, which has begun reporting its results separately even though Ford still owns all of it, announced today that it had earned $282 million after taxes in the second quarter, up 17 percent from a year earlier. Sales rose 7 percent, to $5.1 billion.
Ford's overseas operations, once highly profitable, fared worse in the second quarter. In Europe, where fierce competition and stagnant demand have most auto makers struggling, profits shrank to $89 million from $310 million a year earlier, although $125 million of the drop came from the one-time Volvo charge.
In a statement, Ford acknowledged for the first time that it might not be able to turn around its European operations this year, as officials had previously predicted. "Although Volvo Car will contribute to operating earnings in 1999, it will be a challenge for Ford to achieve its full-year 1999 milestone for Europe, which is to grow earnings compared with 1998," the company said.
Continued economic troubles in South America, particularly Brazil, also hurt Ford. The company lost $120 million in the region in the second quarter, reversing a $14 million gain a year earlier.
Ford's profitability allowed the company to build its cash hoard to $23.96 billion, up from $22.28 billion a year earlier, despite a string of recent, small acquisitions in addition to the Volvo deal.
The key to that profitability lay in North America, where automotive operations produced $1.97 billion in after-tax earnings, an improvement of $314 million from the second quarter of 1998, when sales were also strong.
"I remember analysts' asking Ford Europe if they wanted to withdraw from North America," in the early 1980's, said Scott Merlis, a managing director at Wasserstein Perella Securities Inc. "Times change."

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
Cutting the tax oncapital gains: the theory and the evidence.

BYLINE: By Michael M. Weinstein 

 BODY:
CONGRESS is once again flirting with cutting the tax on capital gains, the profit from selling stocks, bonds and other investments. House Republicans, led by Bill Archer of Texas, chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, have proposed lowering the top rate on capital gains to 15 percent from 20 percent as part of an $864 billion package of tax cuts spread over 10 years. The goal, they say, is to stimulate savings, investment and economic growth.
It's a nice-sounding theory. But many economists say it lacks credible evidence. Joel Slemrod, director of the Office of Tax Policy Research at the University of Michigan, speaks for many of his colleagues when he says that the "idea of cutting capital gains tax to move the economy significantly is implausible." The amount of taxes involved, which in typical years hovers between $20 billion and $50 billion, "is too small to shift an $8 trillion economy," he said. 
 For tax cuts to spur investment, people must save more and then turn more savings over to corporations for investment in plants, equipment or research and development. But Alan J. Auerbach, a professor of economics at the University of California at Berkeley and a former chief economist for the Joint Committee on Taxation, points out that much current savings is exempt from the capital gains tax. The tax does not hit pension funds or other nonprofit organizations. Nor does it affect most foreigners. Without a new wave of saving, there can be no new wave of investment.
For this and other reasons, Professor Auerbach says, "the impact of the capital gains tax is highly attenuated." Stocks held until death are exempt from the capital gains tax, which is watered down further by being imposed only after investments are sold. Investors who hold on to inflated stocks get to postpone paying taxes -- in effect, receiving an interest-free loan from the Government.
The capital gains tax, Professor Auerbach says, "affects investors who receive most of their profit from capital gains on stocks; but perhaps half of the nation's investment is financed with equity, half of the return on stocks comes from capital gains, and half of all equity is owned by taxable investors." In this situation, cutting the tax on capital gains cannot pack much of a wallop.
Professor Auerbach estimates that the proposal would raise the profit on investments by 1 percent to 2 percent at most. Too weak to encourage much future investment, the cut would do little more than provide windfall profit to investors for existing investments -- hardly, economists say, a smart use of taxpayer dollars.
Steven M. Fazzari of the Jerome Levy Economics Institute contends that the case for cutting the capital gains tax depends on three weak links. First, the tax cut must reduce the cost to investors of acquiring new plants and equipment. Second, investors must respond to cheaper capital by investing more. And finally, more capital equipment must translate into more output. Each of these steps, he says, is small.
According to Mr. Fazzari, a 30 percent cut in the capital gains tax -- more than Mr. Archer is proposing -- would be expected to reduce the total cost of acquiring plants and equipment by businesses by only about 2 percent. A 2 percent reduction in the cost of investment would lead to an increase of about five-tenths of a percent in the amount of new investment. And a five-tenths of a percent increase in new capital would translate into an increase of about sixteen-hundredths of a percent in economic output. The economic effect "would be minute," Mr. Fazzari says.
Professor Auerbach acknowledges that capital gains tax cuts can alter the timing of people's decisions to buy and sell stocks and bonds. Obvious proof was provided in 1986, when investors sold twice as many securities as expected in anticipation of higher rates that took effect the following year. But timing mostly affects when the Government collects revenue, not how much it eventually collects.
Sponsors of the tax cut say investors are locked into holding stocks they would sell if not for high taxes on profits. Perhaps so. But this "lock-in" effect has almost no effect on corporate investment. If Mr. Archer's tax-cut proposal encourages Harry to sell his Exxon stock to Sally for $1,000, the sale will not put a dime into Exxon's coffers.
There remains an issue of fairness. The proposal would overwhelmingly benefit the wealthy. Robert McIntyre, director of the Citizens for Tax Justice, estimates that the capital gains tax cut would be worth less than $20 for families earning $40,000 to $60,000 a year but more than $8,000 for families earning more than $300,000 a year.
If the tax cut would truly bolster economic growth, raising wages and reducing unemployment, then its skewed impact might be tolerated. In such case, the best option for Congress would be to pass the tax cut, reap the economy-wide benefits and find a way to raise taxes on wealthy families. But if Mr. Slemrod, Professor Auerbach and Mr. Fazzari are right, the tax would do little more than enrich the already rich.

HEADLINE: Clinton Joins in Gore's Call for Licensing of Gun Owners

BYLINE: By ADAM CLYMER 

DATELINE: BALTIMORE, July 14

 BODY:
President Clinton today called for licensing of handgun owners and said the question before the nation was, "Will we have common-sense gun laws, or government by the gun lobby?"
Addressing a meeting of the Democratic Leadership Council, the centrist party group that the President credits with providing the values behind his Administration's policies, he said, "We ought to take the next step on licensing people who own handguns to make sure that they are trained to use the guns and that they should have them and that would solve all the loopholes because if you had a bad background you couldn't get a license, you couldn't own one." 
Mr. Clinton raised the issue in the context of praising Vice President Al Gore, who called for licensing of handgun owners on Monday, and said other Presidential candidates should follow Mr. Gore's example of making specific promises.
"You probably ought to tell people what you're going to do when you get the job, and then you would be more likely to do it," he said.
While he appeared to acknowledge the difficulty of enacting such legislation, something he said three weeks ago Congress would not pass, he told his audience that his success in balancing the budget showed that "we can do things that are not imaginable at the moment if we will have good ideas and work on them in a disciplined way."
Mr. Clinton gave the Vice President another lift when the White House announced that he would join in five fund-raising events for the Gore campaign, one in Arkansas on Aug. 7 and four in Washington, two on Aug. 10 and two on Sept. 23.
Though the President discussed his latest budget proposal and the need for the nation to help the poorest of its citizens, campaign politics was plainly on his mind. He began his remarks by offering a dismissive interpretation of "compassionate conservatism," the term Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, the front-runner in the race for the Republican Presidential nomination in 2000, uses to describe his approach to government and politics.
Mr. Clinton said: "This 'compassionate conservatism' has a great ring to it, you know. It sounds so good. And I've really worked hard to try to figure out what it means. I mean, I made an honest effort.
"And as near as I can tell, here's what it means -- it means: 'I like you, I do. And I would like to be for the patients' bill of rights, and I'd like to be for closing the gun-show loophole, and I'd like not to squander the surplus and save Social Security and Medicare for the next generation. I'd like to raise the minimum wage. I'd like to do these things. But I just can't, and I feel terrible about it.' "
The President also raised another likely Democratic campaign theme when he recalled the Administration of President George Bush, the Governor's father. "We may have to remind our fellow citizens in times to come just what it was like back then -- how high the unemployment was, how stagnant the wages were, how steeply growing the inequality was, how fast the social conditions were worsening."
Governor Bush himself arrived in Baltimore as Mr. Clinton was leaving and tying up downtown traffic for 40 minutes. The Governor visited an inner-city school, where a student asked him if he would support an increase in the minimum wage. He did not answer directly, but he said he was worried about "pricing people out of work."
When the President turned to poverty, he announced a change in food stamp rules that Agriculture Department aides said could add 22,000 recipients to the current total of 18 million. The rule change would allow food stamps to people who own a car.
The conference itself, billed as a "national conversation" involving 170 elected officials who are allied with the Democratic Leadership Conference, also dealt with poverty more than the group often has in the past, when critics like the Rev. Jesse Jackson said the initials stood for "Democratic Leisure Class."
Lieut. Gov. Kathleen Kennedy Townsend of Maryland told the group it was time to "redirect our efforts, over and over again, to expand the winner's circle" to help those areas that had not shared in the nation's prosperity.
"In the hollows of Appalachia, the migrant worker camps of California and the row-house blocks of East Baltimore," she said, "there is still enormous poverty in our country."
Another voice was sounded for the poor by Mayor Jesse Norwood of Prichard, Ala., who is president of the Conference of African-American Mayors. He complained that the Internet's growth had bypassed poor rural areas, and said that in his city of 34,000 people, "we are no longer interested in the photo ops with no money."
But Mr. Norwood also said that in keeping with the leadership group's philosophy, it was up to local leaders to take charge of their situation. "We can't wait on Washington to give us a grant or give us a loan," he said.

HEADLINE: Con Ed Questioned at Hearing on Blackout

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN 

 BODY:
The 18-hour blackout in northern Manhattan last week has raised serious questions about whether Consolidated Edison's network of underground power cables can handle New York City's growing demands for electricity, the director of the Mayor's Office of Emergency Management said yesterday.
The director, Jerome M. Hauer, voiced his concerns in testimony before the City Council's Consumer Affairs Committee, which yesterday held the first government hearing on the blackout and other power failures that occurred after electrical demand surged during last week's heat wave. 
 Earlier in the hearing, the chairman of Con Edison, Eugene R. McGrath, confirmed that repeated failures of underground power lines, called feeder cables, led to the blackout. As Con Ed workers were trying to bring two repaired feeder cables back on line, the cables caught fire, forcing the utility to shut off all power north of 155th Street in Manhattan.
More than 200,000 people in Washington Heights and Inwood lost power shortly after 10 P.M. on July 6, at the height of a blistering three-day heat wave during which temperatures climbed to more than 100 degrees.
At yesterday's hearing, several Council members, including the Council Speaker, Peter F. Vallone, said they were concerned that Con Edison had not adequately bolstered its infrastructure to accommodate the city's increasing needs.
Mr. Hauer, the city's disaster manager, agreed.
"I think that is basically the heart of the concerns that we all have about what went on in Washington Heights," Mr. Hauer testified. "As neighborhoods have grown, as they have become so vital around the city and we have seen new developments and new businesses, has the infrastructure kept up with it?"
Mr. McGrath, in his testimony and in response to questions, explained that Con Edison determines how many feeder cables to use in each of its networks based on complex calculations that take into account the peak energy demand in the preceding summer, as well as historic weather trends and an analysis of changing demographics and economic factors in the area.
Con Edison is considered one of the most reliable utility companies in the world, and when Mr. Vallone suggested at one point that energy companies in the South were better equipped, Mr. McGrath took exception. "Excuse me," he said, "No one has a more reliable cable system in the world than we have."
Mr. Hauer also sharply criticized Con Edison for giving the city conflicting information about the status of emergency repairs in the hours preceding the blackout.
"I think we need to have one voice from Con Ed because we were getting a number of different analyses of what was going on, particularly in Washington Heights," Mr. Hauer said. "I'd like to understand why there was the difference of opinion in Con Ed as to how the system was functioning."
Yesterday's hearing was the first of several government inquiries scheduled in response to last week's blackout. Today, the New York State Assembly is to hold a similar hearing with many of the same officials, including Mr. McGrath, expected to testify.
While energy experts have recently warned that the power systems in the New York City area are quickly approaching their physical limits and may soon be unable to generate enough electricity to meet the city's needs, Mr. McGrath testified yesterday that the blackout last week was not a result of an inadequate energy supply but of repeated failures in the utility's distribution infrastructure.
Comparing the electrical supply to the water supply to help illustrate his point, Mr. McGrath likened the breakdown of feeder cables last week to a water main break that causes a temporary, localized interruption of service, as opposed to a drought situation in which there is not enough water in a reservoir to meet customer demand.
But his explanation, delivered in a matter-of-fact and unapologetic tone, was not appreciated by Council members, who repeatedly demanded to know specific information about maintenance and inspections of the nearly 90,000 miles of feeder cables all across the city.
While many people in the neighborhoods of northern Manhattan had questioned whether Con Edison had chosen to cut off power to a mostly poor and minority area of the city, the Council members seemed to accept the company's explanation that it could not have chosen to shut off power elsewhere.
Instead, the Council members focused their questions on why the Washington Heights network was served by only 14 feeder cables and whether the number of cables should be increased. "Who made the decision that only 14 feeder cables should service Washington Heights?" Mr. Vallone asked.
Consolidated Edison has appointed a three-member independent panel to review the blackout and to determine the precise reasons why the feeder cables in Washington Heights failed. Joe Petta, a spokesman for Con Edison, said the panel would also examine whether the appropriate number of cables had been in use in Washington Heights and what changes should be made to prevent future blackouts.
In addition to hearing Mr. McGrath and Mr. Hauer, the Council heard testimony from several residents of Washington Heights as well as local business owners and officials from the Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center, which was one of the largest customers to lose power.
Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani has criticized Con Edison repeatedly since the blackout and has said the city will file a lawsuit against the utility seeking to recover damages both for the city and its residents. Michael D. Hess, the city's Corporation Counsel, said the city planned to file the suit today.
And yesterday, Mr. Giuliani continued his attacks on Con Edison's response as too passive.
"What Con Edison should be saying is here are the things that have to be done to make it virtually impossible for blackouts to take place," he said. "We need more power. We need to purchase more power. We need more alternatives. We need a more modern infrastructure, meaning we have to improve the feeder cables so we have better material. We need to insulate them better."

HEADLINE: Working Mother Regains Custody of Two Children

BYLINE: By MELODY PETERSEN 

 BODY:
A Florida appeals court overturned an earlier decision yesterday that had denied a Miami lawyer and mother primary custody of her two children because she worked long hours.
As a result of the ruling, the lawyer, Alice Hector, will regain primary custody of her two young girls from her former husband, Bob Young. 
 Mr. Young, an architect who had been unemployed for several years, had argued that he should be given custody of the two girls because he had spent more time with them than his former-wife, who often worked late as a partner at Steel, Hector & Davis, a Miami law firm. Ms. Hector's uncle is a partner of the firm.
Barbara Green, Mr. Young's lawyer, said yesterday that Mr. Young would try to appeal the decision. "I know the court worked hard on this decision," she said, "but we think it is very wrong."
Neither Mr. Young nor Ms. Hector could be reached for comment.
Seven judges on the 10-judge appeals panel ruled yesterday that the trial court that had originally heard the custody battle had been correct when it awarded primary custody of the girls to Ms. Hector.
The majority disagreed with Mr. Young's contention that the trial court had favored awarding the children to Ms. Hector simply because she was a woman.
Mr. Young had argued that the trial court had discriminated against him and all stay-at-home fathers. "Dads can be moms, too," he had said last year.
But last year, when the appeals panel overturned the trial court's decision, Ms. Hector had said that she believed that the three-man panel took a hard stand against her simply because she was a mother pursuing a challenging career. She insisted that despite her demanding job, she spent more time with the two girls than her former husband did.
Last year, Ms. Hector quit her job at Steel, Hector and opened her own small firm so that she could work more flexible hours.
Mr. Young is a senior program director at the Y.M.C.A. of Greater Miami.
The majority on the appeals court said that the trial court was correct when it relied on evidence suggesting that Ms. Hector had been a constant and dominant influence in the children's lives, while Mr. Young had not. When the two girls were very young, Mr. Young had been away from home for months at a time, settling business matters and hunting for gold believed buried in the desert.
But in recent years, Mr. Young had been a volunteer at the girls' school, founded a Brownie troop and coached the soccer team.
The three judges who dissented yesterday were the same three who had ruled against Ms. Hector last year. In his dissent, Alan R. Schwartz, the chief judge of the Third District state appeals court, said, "there was no question" that the trial court's decision had been "dictated by the evil of gender bias."
Judge Schwartz said that if the genders of the "hard-working and high-earning lawyer and the stay-at- home architect" had been reversed, "the male attorney's claim for custody would have been virtually laughed out of court."

HEADLINE: State Auditors to Examine Books of Distressed City

BYLINE: By RONALD SMOTHERS 

DATELINE: EAST ORANGE, N.J., July 14

 BODY:
State officials have begun auditing the books of this financially struggling city as a prelude to providing $7 million to close the city's budget gap and ordering reforms intended to balance future budgets.
East Orange is one of five economically distressed cities eligible this year for a recently re-enacted type of state aid. The other cities are Jersey City, Paterson, Camden and Irvington, where state audits are to begin soon. 
 Getting the assistance requires intense study of a city's fiscal practices by the state's Division of Community Services.
The state's involvement with the municipalities' finances falls far short of the kind of daily supervision of spending and even policymaking that cities such as New York and Yonkers experienced in the 1970's, when budget deficits prevented them from borrowing money to meet expenses.
Nevertheless, the state's role is considered strong fiscal medicine from the administration of Gov. Christine Todd Whitman because it requires the municipalities not only to open their books to the state but to accept any financial reforms the Division of Community Services orders after seeing the cities' records.
"This is about oversight and accountability, not state control," said Julie Tripodi, the assistant director of local government services of the Division of Community Services, who met with East Orange officials on Tuesday. "All five of these towns have immediate budget problems and were not able to put together a balanced budget this year without an infusion of cash. And there were conditions attached to that cash."
She said the meeting with East Orange officials was the first among the sessions the division plans to hold with officials in all five cities, which are eligible for special allotments totaling $40.5 million set aside in the most recent state budget.
Robert Bowser, the Mayor of East Orange, said in an interview that he welcomed the state's review of the city's $120 million budget and any recommendations for fiscal reform from the state agency.
"These are very experienced people who have worked with urban areas, and if their ideas are better than ours, then we'll do it," he said. "But this administration has a five-year plan that we need to implement, and I am sure some of those things are going to be similar to what the state calls for."
Mr. Bowser said he hoped recommendations from the state agency would resolve political disputes between him and his opponents on the 10-member City Council, who he said had undercut initiatives he had proposed to close the budget gaps he inherited.
The mayor's major proposal for balancing the budget is to sell water to other localities and to bill the individual customers for those localities.
Councilman Mark Scotland, one of Mayor Bowser's opponents, also said he hoped an outside auditor could resolve differences among officials, although he said he expected the auditors to embrace the Council's approach to the city's financial problems.
The aid is provided under the state's Distressed Cities Act, which was passed in 1986 under the administration of former Gov. Thomas Kean to deal with the state's older, more urbanized areas' long-term financial problems. The act provided state aid to dozens of municipalities suffering from declines in tax revenues in the midst of increasing spending needs, in return for state-supervised spending and management reforms.
The program was replaced in the early 1990's by Gov. Jim Florio with a supplemental assistance program that had no spending and budgeting reform conditions attached to it, but the 1986 program was re-enacted last month.
Ms. Tripodi said she could not predict when the audits would be completed or the kinds of recommendations the auditors might make. Everything will be reviewed, she said.
In the past, the overseers have required municipalities to eliminate jobs, reduce services, reform purchasing and investment practices, and change fees for services as diverse as parks and parking.

HEADLINE: Work on Weapons Affected Health, Government Admits

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 14

 BODY:
For the first time, the Federal Government is acknowledging that nuclear weapons production during the cold war may have caused illnesses in thousands of workers, and the Clinton Administration on Thursday will announce legislation that would compensate many of them for their medical care and lost wages.
Energy Secretary Bill Richardson detailed the legislation today in an interview, in which he depicted the workers as victims of the cold war and the rush to produce nuclear weapons. He said the safety standards, which had evolved since the 1940's, had been established in good faith but have since been deemed too weak to have protected workers. 
 The workers suffered from cancers and lung diseases after exposure to beryllium, asbestos, mercury, uranium and other materials, under safety standards set by the Energy Department and its predecessor, the Atomic Energy Commission.
"I am reversing a policy of denial of compensation," Mr. Richardson said.
He noted that the workers who had actually operated the Government factories were almost all employees of private contractors and thus were not eligible for the worker's compensation program that applies to Federal employees. And they were usually unable to collect under state programs because those were designed for injuries, not occupational illnesses.
A handful of Energy Department workers at the plants have fallen ill and have collected worker's compensation, said department officials, but that compensation program is run by the Department of Labor on a no-fault basis, requiring only a determination that the employee was exposed at work. The Energy Department has never acknowledged the cause of their illnesses.
The Clinton Administration will send legislation to Congress within weeks proposing compensation for victims of beryllium disease, a clear-cut case because the weapons program is almost the only user of beryllium.
Energy Department officials have estimated that compensation for those exposed to beryllium, some of whom suffer from a chronic, incurable, obstructive lung disease, will be about $15 million a year at its peak in a few years, when all those eligible are expected to have applied. Officials estimate that 500 to 1,000 people have beryllium disease or will develop it. Their compensation would depend on their lost wages and the extent of their disability.
An undetermined number of families would be eligible to collect benefits for deceased workers.
The Government will also study how to compensate people exposed to asbestos and radioactive materials. Radiation poses a particular challenge, because it causes diseases like leukemia and cancers that also have other causes, and the amount of radiation needed to cause a disease is in dispute.
Several people involved in the formation of the policy said that the Energy Department had originally favored including people exposed to radiation and other threats, but that the White House had demanded further study. President Clinton is expected to announce on Thursday that the National Economic Council will lead an inter-agency study, to be completed by April, on whether other illnesses should be included.
Representative Paul E. Kanjorski, a Democrat who has been seeking help for men who live in his northeast Pennsylvania district who had worked for a company processing beryllium, said that including exposure to other hazards might double the cost, to about $30 million a year.
Mr. Kanjorski said the action represented a major shift in Energy Department policy. "It's unique in terms of the department's normal mode of operating; it wasn't a knee-jerk 'No, find ways to defend against it,' " said Mr. Kanjorski.
The workers are mostly men in their 50's or older who spent decades in skilled blue-collar employment, from the World War II Manhattan Project to the present.
About 9,000 workers have already been screened, and at least 5,000 more will be, according to department officials, with hundreds showing job-related health problems.
Some work or worked at plants that date from the World War II effort to build the bomb, like Oak Ridge in Tennessee; others worked or still work at the Nevada Test Site, near Las Vegas; the Hanford nuclear reservation, in Washington State; Rocky Flats, near Denver; the Idaho National Environmental Engineering Laboratory, near Idaho Springs; Los Alamos National Laboratory, and the Savannah River Site, near Aiken, S.C.
At the Paper, Allied-Industrial, Chemical & Energy Workers International Union, which includes the former Oil, Chemical and Atomic Workers union, Richard D. Miller, a policy analyst, said that "the Secretary has done an enormous public service by admitting the department has made people sick in the process of making nuclear weapons."
He said that the White House should have moved immediately to compensate those made ill by other agents besides beryllium.
Under the Administration proposal, people exposed to beryllium would apply for compensation as if they were Federal employees. As with the state programs, Federal worker's compensation limits payments to medical costs and lost wages; punitive damages are not allowed.
But unlike the state systems, the Federal system has no statute of limitations. Mr. Kanjorski, for example, said that the Pennsylvania program required filing within 300 weeks -- about 6 years -- but that some people had not developed symptoms in that period. Some states only allow for damages for people who have missed work, department officials said, while some victims have incurred medical costs but are still well enough to work. Other states do not allow people to file for greater levels of disability as their diseases progress. And most cap payments for lost wages at well below what the employees were paid.
Alfred F. Matusick, of West Hazleton, Pa., said he began having lung problems within two months of beginning work at the Beryllium Corporation, in Ashmore, where he worked from 1957 until it closed in 1981. Now, Mr. Matusick, 67, said, he gets up several times each night to take cough medicine, and cannot carry a grocery bag or walk more than a few yards without strain.
Mr. Matusick, who over the years operated furnaces, inspected beryllium products and did other jobs at the plant, thought of leaving. "But where else was I going to go?" he said. "Nobody else would hire you if they took X-rays of your lungs, or they found out that you worked for the Beryllium Corporation." He appealed to Mr. Kanjorski for help.

HEADLINE: Pataki Is Target in Bid to Expand Medicaid for Working Poor

BYLINE: By RANDY KENNEDY 

 BODY:
Under a little-known provision in the 1996 Federal welfare law, New York has become eligible to receive several hundred million dollars a year from Washington to expand Medicaid coverage for one of its fastest-growing and most troubling uninsured populations: low-income working parents.
But while nine other states, including Connecticut, have quietly begun to take advantage of the rule -- under which the Federal Government shoulders at least half of the states' costs for expanding the program -- New York has not. And so a broad alliance of hospitals, unions and advocates for the poor is coalescing to pressure Gov. George E. Pataki to use state money to prompt the release of Federal matching funds. 
 The lobbying campaign will focus on the state's $25 billion share of the national tobacco settlement, which the Democrats who control the State Assembly want to see used mostly to expand coverage for the uninsured. In this way, money would be directed toward the problem without increasing Medicaid expenses in the state budget.
But Governor Pataki has advocated using most of the tobacco money to help reduce state debt, and spending only about $100 million a year on health-related expenses. Only part of that -- Mr. Pataki has not specified the amount -- is planned to help the uninsured.
Many experts believe that the problem will require much more money than the Governor is planning to commit. A study of the issue released this week by the Commonwealth Fund, a private philanthropic and research organization in New York, estimated that 266,000 working poor parents are ineligible for Medicaid and do not get coverage at work, though their children still qualify for public health-care coverage.
To cover all those parents, the state would need to spend about $420 million a year, an amount the Federal Government would be required to match, said Assemblyman Richard N. Gottfried, chairman of the Health Committee. Mr. Gottfried, a Manhattan Democrat, is a sponsor of a bill passed by the Assembly last month that would tap into the Federal Medicaid money by using tobacco money, which is to be paid to the states over 25 years to compensate for money spent treating tobacco-related illnesses. The plan has received some support from Joseph L. Bruno, the Senate majority leader, who had once advocated using most of the tobacco money for tax cuts.
"Even if you look at this strictly as an economic issue," Mr. Gottfried said, "bringing in almost half a billion in Federal money with no extra burden on New York taxpayers is pretty compelling. But these are also people we should be helping."
Most troubling for New York and other states is that the uninsured people are doing exactly what many states want them to do: getting jobs instead of going on welfare. But in doing so, they fall into a health-care limbo.
They are people like Martilde Ramirez, a 30-year-old Brooklyn woman, who could have gone on welfare when her husband left several years ago. Instead, she got a job at a hat factory in Bushwick, Brooklyn, where she makes $5.40 an hour, barely enough to raise her three children, but too much to qualify for Medicaid. She does not get health insurance through her job, she said.
On Tuesday, she took her 1-year-old son, Angel Aguilar, to get inoculations at Woodhull Hospital in Brooklyn, where his bills are paid by a state-Federal health care program for children. But Ms. Ramirez, who emigrated from Mexico nine years ago, has not seen a doctor since shortly after she gave birth. Before that, she went for three years without seeing a doctor.
"If I get sick," she said in Spanish, through a translator, "then I think I will just have to go back to my country."
Dennis Rivera, president of the union that represents 150,000 health care workers, said the union will join health-care advocates and state hospital and community clinic groups in a campaign to pressure the Pataki administration to use much more of the tobacco money for the uninsured.
"We've got to organize that majority sentiment to exert pressure on the elected officials to do the right thing," Mr. Rivera said. "All the participants agree that some share of it should be used, but the question is how much."
Joseph Conway, a spokesman for the Governor's budget office, said, "The Governor has proposed using a portion of the tobacco settlement proceeds to address health-care-related issues, such as the uninsured and underinsured." He declined to say whether that portion will be any larger than what the Governor has already proposed. "At this point that's a matter that's going to be discussed with the Legislature," he said.
The predicament of the uninsured working poor is a daunting one for states as they scale back welfare because the lack of health care discourages parents from getting jobs. The Commonwealth Fund study, conducted with the help of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a Washington research and advocacy group, found that in New York State, low-income working parents are twice as likely to lack health coverage as those who are not working.
The states that have begun to tap into the Federal Medicaid money over the last year -- Connecticut, California, Rhode Island, Wisconsin, Missouri, Oklahoma, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Maine, along with the District of Columbia -- have often done so as part of comprehensive programs to encourage people to leave welfare and get jobs. The program does not set a limit on how high states can set eligibility limits for Medicaid, but will match whatever the states are willing to pay.
"It isn't that well known," said Tricia Leddy, an administrator for the Center for Child and Family Health in Rhode Island, which oversees Medicaid programs. "But it is very broad. You could drive a truck through it."
Most of the states began programs last year after the Federal Government began to encourage states to take advantage of the provision.
Rhode Island used the program to extend coverage beginning last November to parents earning up to 185 percent of the Federal poverty level -- which usually means, depending on family size, workers earning in the high teens. In the first eight months of the program, 8,500 parents signed up, costing Rhode Island about $2.35 million and the Federal Government $2.75 million.
The New York Assembly bill would extend coverage to working parents making up to 200 percent of the Federal poverty level -- or about $27,600 for a family of three.
The growing number of uninsured people in the state -- mostly the working poor, students, children and early retirees -- has become the biggest problem facing the health care industry. About 17 percent of people under 65 lack health insurance nationwide, but the number in New York is 19 percent -- roughly three million people -- and growing faster than the national average.
According to the New York State Health Department, city hospitals provided $1.2 billion in care to those who could not pay in 1997, the last year for which figures are available. The same year, the state collected, through taxes on hospitals and insurers, only $635 million in a charity pool used to compensate hospitals for such care.
Because of the shortfall, hospitals and clinics are forced to shift charity care costs onto patients with insurance, driving up health-care costs for businesses and prompting many small businesses to cancel coverage -- adding, in turn, to the problem.

HEADLINE: Bush Adds $800,000 to Election Bank Account in Sweep Through Washington Area

BYLINE: By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 14

 BODY:
Campaigning within a few miles of the White House, George W. Bush swept through the capital region today, picking up $800,000 in contributions, winning the endorsement of a Republican rival and promising the nation "a fresh start after a season of cynicism."
Mr. Bush, the Governor of Texas, tried to walk the thin line between humility and confidence that he would win his party's Presidential nomination. 
 "I'm running with one thing in mind -- I'm running to win," he told more than 500 people who raised $400,000 for him at a luncheon at the Ritz-Carlton Hotel in McLean, Va., "I intend to become the next President of the United States."
He later gladly accepted the endorsement of Representative John R. Kasich, the Ohio Republican who dropped out of the Presidential race today. Mr. Bush told Mr. Kasich he would "fit perfectly on my team," and, "I intend to use you."
Aides to Mr. Kasich said that once Bush officials heard in the last few days that Mr. Kasich planned to abandon his Presidential bid, they sought his immediate endorsement, fueling speculation that Mr. Kasich's ready compliance would make him eligible for a post in a Bush Administration.
Mr. Kasich joins a stampede of 122 Republicans of the 223 in the House who have endorsed Mr. Bush. Asked at a news conference in Washington what Mr. Kasich's chances were of becoming his running mate, Mr. Bush told reporters, "They just increased."
At the fund-raising luncheon attended by executives from the high-tech industry, Mr. Bush discussed his economic philosophy. The luncheon attracted luminaries such as the America Online's chairman and chief executive, Steve Case.
"You and I know that governments don't create wealth," Mr. Bush said. "Wealth is created by entrepreneurs and dreamers and doers and people who are willing to risk capital. The role of government is to create an environment in which entrepreneurship can flourish."
He said he would encourage the entrepreneurial spirit by reducing the marginal tax rates, cutting regulations, ending tariffs, rebuilding the nation's military power and curbing trial lawyers by enacting "long-lasting, meaningful, real tort reform."
After the Kasich endorsement in Washington, Mr. Bush moved on to Baltimore, where he promoted his belief in church-based programs to help children avoid lives of crime and drugs. He then attended another fund-raiser that brought in $400,000, making his total take for about five hours to about $800,000. That will be added to the record-breaking $36 million he has already collected.
Mr. Bush's supporters sought to play down any notion that they are taking his nomination for granted. The biggest danger to his campaign, his backers said, aside from the wealth of the rival party candidate Steve Forbes, is the air of inevitability that could irk some voters into thinking that they never had a voice in their party's nomination.
Vice President Al Gore, the front-running Democrat, picked up on that theme today, chiding Mr. Bush as being "ready to move into the mansion before the election."
"Bush has to win the nomination," said Haley Barbour, former chairman of the Republican National Committee and now a lobbyist and Bush backer, as he watched Mr. Kasich endorse the Governor. "He's not going to get it on a silver platter."

THE AMERICAS
 
PERU: REBEL CHIEF SEIZED
The army announced that it had captured the last remaining commander of the Shining Path guerrilla group not already in jail after a patrol spotted him near Huancayo, in the jungles of central Huancayo Province. Oscar Ramirez Durand, left, who goes by the nom de guerre Comrade Feliciano, took over the Maoist group after the capture of Abimael Guzman in 1992. The group has been in a decline since Mr. Guzman's arrest and is now making only occasional hit-and-run attacks. Clifford Krauss (NYT)
 
ARGENTINA: LIFE TERMS SOUGHT IN '94 BLAST
A prosecutor sought life sentences for 19 people, including 10 former police officers, accused of being accomplices in the 1994 bombing of a Jewish center that killed 86 people. The prosecutor said he would be ready to present his case in two months. The United States and Israel have said they believe Iranian-back Islamic terrorists were behind the attack. Clifford Krauss (NYT) 

ECUADOR: EMERGENCY REIMPOSED
Raising the stakes in an increasingly bitter struggle for dominance, President Jamal Mahuad has reimposed a 60-day state of national emergency overturned by the opposition-controlled Congress. With a nationwide transport workers' strike well into its second week despite a rollback of an increase in fuel prices that set off the protests, and some areas running short of food and other supplies, Mr. Mahuad said "the gravity of the country's situation" required that he be given special powers. Larry Rohter (NYT)
 
MEXICO: MAYOR ASSOCIATE RANSOMED
Jesus Ortega, a close political associate of Mexico City's Mayor, Cuauhtemoc Cardenas Solorzano, was kidnapped off the street near his home and released several hours later when his wife paid a ransom of about $1,000. Mr. Ortega suffered the "express" kidnapping, a common form of crime in the capital, on the day when Mr. Cardenas opened a campaign to publicize his efforts to reduce crime. Julia Preston (NYT)
 
MEXICO: BANK CLEARED BY U.S.
Civil money laundering charges against Grupo Financiero Banorte S.A., Mexico's fifth largest financial group, were dismissed by a United States District Court judge, the first full exoneration of a Mexican bank in an investigation called Operation Casablanca. The United States has agreed to return $1.4 million in seized assets to Banorte and $200,000 to a subsidiary. Rick Wills (NYT)
 
EUROPE
 
FRANCE: CHIRAC TO STAY TILL 2002
France's Gaullist President, Jacques Chirac, said in a Bastille Day television interview that he would serve out his full seven-year term, ending in May 2002, despite the problems of sharing power with a Socialist-led Government since 1997. Mr. Chirac refused to say if he was thinking of running for a second term in 2002, when the Socialist Prime Minister, Lionel Jospin, is expected to run against him. Craig R. Whitney (NYT)
 
SPAIN: A JOINT PUSH FOR DEMOCRACY
Five foundations linked to the ruling conservative Popular Party or the opposition Socialist Party set up the Spanish Commission to Support Democracy, which aims to promote democracy in developing nations with projects like bringing 200 leftist guerrillas from Colombia to study in Spain. The National Endowment for Democracy, in Washington, supported the move, seen as a sign that Spain's democracy is secure 23 years after Francisco Franco died. Al Goodman (NYT)
 
SWITZERLAND: RUSSIAN INVESTIGATED
Geneva authorities have begun an investigation into money laundering allegations against a Russian presidential aide, Pavel Borodin. A judge said Swiss banks had been ordered to freeze any accounts held by Mr. Borodin, his wife and 22 other Russians who may be involved in the scandal. Also under investigation is the Swiss construction company Mabetex, which is accused of paying bribes in return for a $300 million renovation at the Kremlin. Elizabeth Olson (NYT)
 
KAZAKHSTAN, RUSSIA: SPACE BAN EASED
Kazakhstan eased a ban on space launchings from its Baikonur cosmodrome, clearing the way for Russia to send a cargo craft with vital supplies to the Mir manned space station. The ban remains in force only for rocket boosters of the type that crashed after takeoff on July 5 and prompted the former Soviet republic to temporarily suspend all launchings. (Reuters)
 
ASIA
 
INDONESIA: ELECTION RESULTS DUE
Tentative results from Indonesia's June parliamentary election will finally be ready today, more than five weeks after polling day, election officials said. The National Elections Committee said it had counted votes from 26 of the country's 27 provinces. A final result is due next Wednesday. (Reuters)
 
AZERBAIJAN, ARMENIA: 2 LEADERS TO MEET
President Heydar Aliyev of Azerbaijan will fly to Geneva today for one-day talks with his Armenian counterpart, Robert Kocharian, on the conflict over Nagorno-Karabakh, Azerbaijani officials said. Armenians and Azerbaijanis fought an undeclared war over Nagorno-Karabakh, an Armenian-populated territory within Azerbaijan that ended with a cease-fire in May 1994 after six years.

MIDDLE EAST
 
IRAQ: ARMS TEAM ARRIVES
A team of inspectors from the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, an international group based in The Hague that monitors chemical weapons agreements, arrived in Baghdad to help the United Nations dismantle a laboratory that contains tiny amounts of mustard agents and other chemicals. The group lent its inspectors for the mission after Iraq refused to accept inspectors from the United Nations Special Commission charged with disarming Iraq of unconventional weapons. Judith Miller (NYT)
 
IRAQ: NEW U.S. ATTACKS
United States warplanes bombed Iraqi defense sites in the northern no-flight zone after being fired on by Iraqi antiaircraft artillery, the United States European Command in Stuttgart said. It was the 60th time since the end of last year that Air Force planes have struck Iraqi installations in the north in response to reported Iraqi threats. (AP)
 
ISRAEL: ARAB NAMED TO KEY PANEL
An Israeli Arab lawmaker was appointed for the first time to the Israeli Parliament's Foreign Affairs and Security Committee, breaking a longstanding ban on Arab membership. Hashem Mahameed, of the United Arab List faction, was named to the panel over the protests of the rightist Likud Party, which called his admission a security risk. Joel Greenberg (NYT)
 
SYRIA: AMNESTY FOR THOUSANDS
More than 150,000 prisoners, most held for cheating on food rations, will be freed under an amnesty by President Hafez al-Assad, the London-based daily Al Hayat reported. Other crimes covered by the amnesty include desertion from the military, smuggling, foreign exchange violations and economic offenses. (AP)
 
AFRICA
 
ALGERIA: O.A.U. MEETING ENDS
African heads of state vowed to end the conflicts that have sapped the continent's human and material resources as they ended a three-day summit meeting of the Organization of African Unity. A final declaration referred to conflicts in the Horn of Africa, Congo, Sierra Leone, Sudan, Burundi, Angola and Somalia, among others, as "many time bombs" left over from the colonial era. But it said the 52 member states did not intend to shirk their responsibility for problems "still bedeviling our countries." (AP)
 
UNITED NATIONS
 
TALKS ON EAST TIMOR
With violence threatening to delay a vote on the future of East Timor, the United Nations called officials from Indonesia and Portugal to another round of talks in New York for today and Friday. A spokesman said Nugroho Wisnumurti of Indonesia and Fernando Neves of Portugal, both senior foreign ministry officials, would also discuss what happens after the vote, to be held either Aug. 21 or 22.

HEADLINE: In Japan, Mired in Recession, Suicides Soar

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE STROM 

DATELINE: TOKYO, July 14

 BODY:
In their annual sweep of the Aokigahara woods at the end of last year, police officers found 73 bodies.
There is nothing unusual about finding bodies in Aokigahara. The lush and sprawling forest nestled at the foot of Mount Fuji has long been one of the most popular places in Japan for suicides. What is different now is the number: a year earlier, the police recovered 55 bodies. 
 Japanese are killing themselves in record numbers.
Some 90 people a day committed suicide last year, a 34.7 percent rise over the previous year, according to statistics from the National Police Agency that provoked the Asahi Shimbun, one of Japan's leading daily newspapers, to declare the situation an "emergency."
Japan's economic recession, and the shame and stress caused by layoffs or the fear of them, are largely to blame, most experts say, although suicides often stem from a combination of factors, among them depression.
Japanese are grappling with unemployment that has risen to record levels as struggling companies slash their work forces and cut back on hiring new graduates in an effort to bring costs more in line with international standards.
A total of 32,863 people committed suicide in 1998, both the largest number and the highest rate of suicide recorded since the police began keeping records in 1947. "I don't recall anything like this ever before," said Yukiko Nishihara, who has run a suicide prevention line for more than 20 years in Osaka and now Tokyo.
Suicide in Japan has little of the stigma it carries in Western societies; in literature, history and even today, suicides are often portrayed as noble, a matter of conscience or an honorable form of protest. The rate of suicide in the United States in 1997 was 11.4 per 100,000, according to the latest figures from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, compared with 19.3 per 100,000 in Japan.
In recent years, though, there has been increasing criticism of suicide as irresponsible to survivors. And for years, suicide rates in Japan have been lower than those in several other industrialized countries. Statistics comparing this year's suicide rate in Japan with that in other countries do not exist.
This year, however, what caused most people here to catch their breath was the increase in the number of middle-aged men who killed themselves. There was a 44.6 percent rise in suicides among men aged 40 to 59, according to the police.
Japanese were also shocked by the number of young men who took their lives. Some 40 percent more men in their 20's committed suicide last year. Typically, this is a stable time in Japanese life, when young men could count on becoming "shaiin," literally members of society, by entering the work force. Now, jobs are harder to find.
"Even if you graduate from the best university, you cannot always find a job," Mrs. Nishihara said. "Young people are feeling very hopeless about their future."
The largest single increase -- 53.1 percent among children 10 through 19 -- is largely ascribed to family and school-related problems and mental illness, but experts say it is hard to link those deaths to the economy. Children here have historically tended to kill themselves at a higher rate than adults, Mrs. Nishihara said, so when adult suicide rates jump, the rates among people in their teens jump even more.
The shame associated with not having a job is immense, overwhelming and much understood by senior executives, who feel bullied by foreign investors and analysts pushing them to move more aggressively to cut jobs.
"Of course there is a relationship between restructuring and suicide," said Atsushi Murayama, the managing director in charge of personnel at the Matsushita Electric Industrial Company and one of the few Japanese executives who has spoken openly, if reluctantly, about the problem. "Foreign analysts and the foreign press also have responsibility, too."
Matsushita, like many other Japanese companies, has worked hard to avoid layoffs, a stance characterized as foot-dragging by foreigners but regarded as heroic here.
"Yes, we have to be competitive with global companies, but seniority pay emphasizes security," Mr. Murayama said. "We have to adapt to free-style competition but also take consideration of the Japanese social situation."
Having a job, however, apparently does not confer much of a sense of relief, either. Many men who killed themselves in the last year were employed but fearful of losing their jobs or overwhelmed by increased workloads that were a result of colleagues losing their jobs, according to experts.
Wages have fallen, too, which is especially disastrous for middle-aged men, who are usually the sole earner in families struggling to shoulder the heavy burden of both mortgage payments and supplementary educational programs, standard for many Japanese children.
A survey by the Bureau of Employment Security showed that of those unemployed white-collar workers in their 50's who have managed to find jobs after being laid off -- and many of them don't -- the average income is just 60 percent of what they were previously making.
Financial straits, however, are not as important as the loss of face that is a corollary to losing a job.
"Certainly, there are some people who commit suicide for financial reasons," said Hiroshi Kawahito, a lawyer who specializes in representing the families of victims of karoshi, literally death from overwork, and an outspoken commentator on suicide and its causes. "But I think the most important reason is that in Japan, if workers lose their jobs, they will be looked down upon by society."
Mr. Kawahito and a group of lawyers recently opened a one-day special telephone line that received more than 300 calls from families of karoshi and suicide victims and victims in the making. "Often companies scold the families of victims, saying the victim escaped his responsibilities and so behaved in an irresponsible manner," Mr. Kawahito said. "So in Japan, the culprit and the victim are often reversed, I think."
Families of suicide victims who die by throwing themselves in front of a train are good examples of that. The Chuo line has been nicknamed the Chuo-cide in some quarters because its tracks are a favorite among suicides. JR East, the company that operates the line, charges families a fee depending on how badly traffic is disrupted.
The line has reflected the overall trend in suicides. In the fiscal year that ended March 31, 33 people were killed on the line compared with 25 in the previous year. (The company calls the deaths accidents because, it says, it has no way of distinguishing the person who died as a result of suicide from a person who wandered drunk onto the tracks.)
Because gun ownership is severely restricted in Japan, many Japanese resort to throwing themselves in front of trains, hanging themselves, jumping off cliffs or overdosing, the police say.
The suicide rate has risen every year but one since 1990, when it dropped to the lowest level since 1947. That year coincides with the burst of the economic bubble, the effect of which gradually snowballed until Japan finally slid into a tenacious recession in 1997 that only just seems to be coming to an end.
But while economic distress has clearly helped increase the numbers, Shizuo Machizawa, one of Japan's few specialists in the field, suggests that the economic woes have worsened a trend that would have developed anyway.
Dr. Machizawa, like many observers of Japan after World War II, believes that the suicide rate is one response to a gradual breakdown of a system that rewarded traditional Japanese values of loyalty, hierarchy and paternalism. Typically, in Japanese companies, subordinates offer their department heads absolute loyalty, and in return Japanese executives take care of their charges with an almost fatherly devotion. Now, with pressures to lay off employees, cut costs and improve efficiency, neither the boss nor the subordinate can necessarily fulfill his side of the traditional bargain.
 "In the past, employees could predict their career trajectory," Dr. Machizawa said. "Now, they can't." As managers are forced to lay off staff or tell older workers that younger subordinates may be making more money, the sense of shame for the bearer of bad tidings can be overwhelming."
Kouji Nishigaki, the president of the NEC Corporation, which has embarked on one of the most sweeping employment cutbacks ever taken by a Japanese corporation, said, "I think Japanese managers have a great responsibility to secure employment for their work force so their lives won't fall apart,"
Nonetheless, a large chunk of the company's jobs cuts have come at the expense of employees in its international operations, while in Japan, a cutback in recruitment combined with early retirement will ultimately eliminate some 6,000 jobs.
NEC is just one of several Japanese companies that have hired Dr. Machizawa to consult with distraught and depressed employees and conduct seminars, although, in general, psychiatric care here is limited to administering antidepressants and advising patients to try to take time off, advice that is unrealistic in an era of rising unemployment.
Mr. Kawahito, the lawyer, noted that the number of people who kill themselves outnumbers the number of people who die in traffic accidents by a factor of three. "If there was an increase in traffic accidents, the Japanese Government would surely make an effort to reduce the number," he said. "But the suicide rate keeps going up and we have no Government policy."
In Aokigahara, several local groups have banded together with the police to fight suicide in the forest. They have nailed signs on trees along several of the paths leading into the woods, imploring potential suicide victims to think again.
"Life is a precious present from your parents," the signs say. "Think quietly about your parents, brothers and sisters and children. Do not agonize alone, please consult us first." The telephone number for the Fujiyoshida Police Precinct follows.
The police patrol the area looking for likely suicide victims and pick up about one person a day on average, a precinct spokesman said. "For instance, if someone is wearing a suit, we certainly stop the car and take them into custody," he said.

HEADLINE: For Hives and Honey In New York City;
Rooftop Beekeepers Defy Law to Get That Sweet Central Park Bouquet

BYLINE: By GLENN COLLINS 

 BODY:
The setting -- the rooftop of a brownstone on West 113th Street in Manhattan -- hardly evoked the lazy bee-hum of rusticity. Looming to the north was the brick bulk of Butler Library at Columbia University. To the southeast jutted the latticework scaffolding of the ever-unfinished Cathedral of St. John the Divine.
Suddenly, the swirl of bees hanging around two honeybee hives formed a cloud about the heads of four of the brownstone's inhabitants, Jill Laurie Goodman and her three children, urban beekeepers all. "Just look at them," Ms. Goodman said proudly of her bees, as if she were acknowledging a blue-ribbon Charolais steer at the county fair. "Aren't they amazing?" 
 If pigeon-fancying was the rooftop recreation of choice during the "On the Waterfront" era, urban beekeeping is poised to become a hot new bull-market avocation. Two summers ago, David Graves, a veteran bee master who was on the roof helping Ms. Goodman tend the hives, knew of just one beehive in the five boroughs: now he is aware of 13 hives in Manhattan, Brooklyn and the Bronx. And city beekeepers claim that there could be twice that number.
But few beekeepers reveal their presence because under the New York City Health Code the activity is illegal. Section 161.01 bans keeping animals that are "wild, ferocious, fierce, dangerous or naturally inclined to do harm." An offender could be fined up to $2,000.
"By nature, bees are wild, and people are in danger of being stung," pointed out John Gadd, a spokesman for the city's Department of Health. "And for those who are allergic to bees, it's a-life-or-death issue."
But like many other beekeepers, Mr. Graves -- a veteran hive master from Becket, Mass., who introduced Ms. Goodman to beemania two summers ago -- contends that honeybees rarely sting when they are away from their rooftop hives, which are locked and inaccessible to pedestrians. "A ban on bees is like a ban on nature," he said.
Mr. Graves has become the Johnny Appleseed of New York beedom. Four days a week, the 49-year-old farmer visits New York to sell home-produced honeys, jams, jellies and maple syrups from his Berkshire Berries cart. For six years he has been a fixture in the Greenmarkets at Union Square, the World Trade Center and West 77th Street at Columbus Avenue.
Two years ago, to increase the supply of his signature offering, New York City Honey, Mr. Graves began establishing hives on buildings owned by sympathetic New Yorkers. He maintains the hives, trains the owners to be beekeepers and gives them some of the honey as rent. The rest goes into his golden bottles, emblazoned with yellow-and-blue labels proclaiming his product "Beelicious."
Whether the Health Department plans any queen-bee busts is unclear. Last month the agency faced the rage of a group called New York City Friends of Ferrets when it adopted a list of more than 150 animal species deemed unfit for urban living.
"What is this administration going to do next, ban calico cats?" demanded City Councilwoman Kathryn E. Freed of Manhattan.
As for honeybees, the Health Department "has no idea what it's talking about," said Peter J. Solomon, a Manhattan investment banker and former Deputy Mayor for Economic Policy and Development, who has kept bees for 21 years at various country homes. "It's ridiculous to say they are dangerous."
Some bee authorities concur. "I disagree with the city's rating of the bees as a threat, though I can understand the city's concern," said Dr. Michael S. Engel, an entomologist at the American Museum of Natural History. "Honeybees won't hurt you unless you grab them, or go after their hive. They are docile and just want to go about their business of gathering pollen and nectar."
Furthermore, Dr. Engel contended, no ban "can get rid of bees as a threat in New York" because the city is home to millions of indigenous bumblebees, sweat bees and wood-boring carpenter bees, none of them raised by humans. Beyond that, yellow jackets are more dangerous than honeybees, Dr. Engel said, adding, "Wasps are aggressive hunters looking for the kill."
As for the allergy question, "If people are allergic to bees, they shouldn't be beekeepers, but that shouldn't mean that other people can't be beekeepers," said Ms. Goodman of Morningside Heights. "Some people are allergic to peanuts, but that shouldn't stop stores from selling peanuts."
All right, but why beekeeping? "After you do it, everything else in life is calm," said Mr. Solomon, the investment banker. "Let me tell you, 40,000 bees will teach you the power of concentration and patience."
But in the Big Apple? "I suppose I had some leftover farming yearning from the 60's," said Karen Lamberti, who has a hive on the roof of her East Harlem brownstone at 101st Street between Park and Lexington Avenues. "This is a way to do a bit of farming in the city."
Others have culinary motives. Carl Redding, 35, hopes for "a New York honey harvest for our Spicy Honey Chicken," he said. The dish is a specialty of his Harlem establishment, Amy Ruth's Restaurant. With Mr. Graves's help, Mr. Redding ensconced a hive on the roof of the restaurant, at 113 West 116th Street near Lenox Avenue, and tends the honeybees. "I also think it's important to teach kids from our neighborhood about farming," said Mr. Redding, who was the chief of staff for the Rev. Al Sharpton before the restaurant industry beckoned, "so they'll know that honey is made in hives, and not in the supermarket."
Ms. Goodman, a 50-year-old lawyer who is the counsel to the New York State Judicial Committee on Women and the Courts, decided that apiculture was the bee's knees after she happened upon Mr. Graves's farm stand at the Greenmarket. She noticed his demonstration beehive carrying the sign: "We are very gentle. We'd like to share our New York City honey. Do you have a rooftop?"
Ms. Goodman was intrigued. She then consulted her husband, Melvin Jules Bukiet, 45, a writer whose most recent novel is "Signs and Wonders." "I said I could think of nothing more terrifying, but this seemed to be a fascinating terror," he recalled.
Now she and her children -- Madelaine, 15, Louisa, 13, and Miles, 11 -- have set up a second beehive, their own, and enjoy beekeeping together.
"It's great because you can leave your tensions behind," Ms. Goodman said. "Honeybees are truly amazing creatures when you get to know them. We have such a complex relationship with them: we care for them, and provide them with a home, but we have no idea where they go. They have this whole mysterious life out there in the city."
Less theoretically, her daughter Madelaine volunteered, "If you spend time with them, they're furry and really cute."
The city's urban bee mavens inhabit their own entomological universe, sharing useful information about mite cures or re-queening protocols (that is, replacing a jaded queen bee). As might be expected, they are also given to apiary humor. There are puns about the, well, plight of the bumblebee and requests to "lend me your comb"; and, yes, there are questions about whether to bee or not to bee. Mr. Solomon, a graduate of the Harvard Business School, has been known to tell hive masters that he has a degree from "the Harvard bee school."
On a recent afternoon on her rooftop, Ms. Goodman unhinged the hive cover and she and Mr. Graves began examining the individual wooden bee frames, wedging out big pieces of honeycomb. Being from New York, it boasts a bouquet that is "more floral -- sweeter -- and has a lighter taste," said Mr. Graves. He noted that the bees forage in Central Park, at rooftop planters, outside florists' shops and in community gardens, rather than at upstate clover fields or deep-South orange groves.
But it isn't the easiest thing in the world to sweet-talk skeptical New Yorkers into buying urban honey for $5 a pound. "You would think that New York honey might have a rather strong flavor," said Judith Cramer, a computer-science teacher who had stopped by Mr. Graves's cart at the Union Square Greenmarket specifically to buy New York honey as a gift for a friend who lives in England.
"Actually, it's rather sweet," Mr. Graves said.
"No, you'd think that New York honey would be quite aggressive as far as honeys go," Ms. Cramer said with a laugh. "You know, it's the honey that says, 'What's it to you?' " She happily bought a bottle.
"I think honey could be a great cash crop for New York," said Mr. Solomon, who, when he was Deputy Mayor under Edward I. Koch, suggested passionately -- and unsuccessfully -- that commercial apiculture would be a novel way to revitalize parts of the South Bronx.
Back on the roof, Mr. Bukiet sighed as he surveyed the spectacle of his wife and children poking into their two big-city beehives.
"You raise your children in Manhattan, you think they'll be the ultimate urbanites, and instead you get a bunch of naturalists," he said, deadpan. "Where did I go wrong?"

HEADLINE: Political Briefing;
She's Got Momentum, And the Name Too

BYLINE: By B. Drummond Ayres Jr. 

 BODY:
Another Kennedy is making a move.
Robert F. Kennedy's oldest child, Kathleen Kennedy Townsend, who for four and a half years has been Lieutenant Governor of Maryland, held a fund-raiser at the Baltimore Zoo the other night, an event widely viewed as her first public step toward a run for governor in 2002. More than 3,000 of the Democratic faithful showed up. 
 After a slow start as Lieutenant Governor -- her early appearances were awkward, her early speeches scrambled -- Mrs. Townsend is on a political roll. She now comes across in public as, well, a Kennedy, one quick with the smile, the quip, the clap on the back, and she has slowly but steadily built a reputation as a strong advocate of aggressive economic development, better schools, innovative anticrime measures and community service. By the time she won election to a second term last fall, she had a job approval rating pushing impressively toward 75 percent.
In recent weeks, her name has begun to appear on lists of possible Democratic Vice-Presidential candidates for Election 2000. This week she is serving as a co-chairwoman of a Baltimore meeting of the Democratic Leadership Council, one of the party's most influential policy groups, whose president, Al From, calls her "a model for New Democrats." A veteran Maryland pollster, Keith Haller, says her political development in recent years has been "quite extraordinary."
Yet even as she moves toward a run for governor, making more headlines than ever, Mrs. Townsend refuses to discuss her political future. She told The Baltimore Sun the other day that she preferred to keep the focus on the present and her various policy initiatives, because "good policy is good politics."
But then she added, "I intend to be around for a long time."

HEADLINE: NEW MEANS FOUND FOR REDUCING H.I.V. PASSED TO CHILD

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE K. ALTMAN 

 BODY:
In an advancement that promises to significantly reduce the incidence of AIDS in children in developing countries, American and Ugandan scientists have found a simple new way to prevent mother-to-child transmission of the AIDS virus that also is less costly and markedly more effective than the standard therapy in the third world.
The more practical therapy comes from substituting one marketed drug, nevirapine, for the standard drug, AZT. The cost for the two doses of nevirapine was $4, compared with $268 for the AZT regimen now used in developing countries and $815 for the much longer and more complicated course used in the United States and other developed countries, Federal health officials said in releasing the findings yesterday. 
 The new treatment calls for both a mother and her infant to take nevirapine just one time -- a mother takes a pill once during labor, and her baby is fed the drug as a syrup once during the first three days of life.
Nevirapine, a drug used in combination "cocktail" treatments, has been marketed since 1996 in the United States for treatment of H.I.V., the AIDS virus, and it was remarkably safe in the study that was conducted by American and Ugandan researchers. As babies reached 3 months of age, nevirapine had cut the risk of mother-to-child transmission of H.I.V. to 13 percent from the 25 percent for the standard course of AZT in developing countries, or a reduction of 47 percent, United States and Ugandan health officials said.
Monitoring will continue for 18 months to determine adverse effects that might show up later in infancy. The monitoring will also help to determine how many babies will still become infected through breast-feeding in the first months of life, when such transmission is highest.
H.I.V. can be transmitted during pregnancy or during delivery when bleeding occurs. Nevirapine is believed to be able to block transmission of H.I.V. during the delivery, and further studies will be needed to determine if transmission can be stopped during breast-feeding.
Nevirapine targets the same enzyme in H.I.V. as AZT, but it is a different class of drug.
The low cost of nevirapine makes it feasible for wide-scale use in many developing countries, Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, who heads the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, predicted in an interview. His Federal agency paid for the study.
Dr. Peter Piot, who heads the United Nations AIDS program in Geneva, said the nevirapine study was "a major gain" because it "approaches ideal prevention therapy" for developing countries, where 95 percent of the H.I.V.-infected people live.
But Dr. Piot said it was "unrealistic to introduce it on a large scale in developing countries without first using pilot programs" because drug therapy is only one part of a complex effort to prevent H.I.V. Such pilot studies will begin soon in developing countries, he said.
Most women in developing countries do not know that they are H.I.V.-infected because testing programs are scarce. "It is still a logistical, economic and cultural challenge to develop programs to encourage H.I.V. testing, counseling and baby formula as a substitute for breast-feeding for infected mothers," Dr. Piot said in an interview.
American and Ugandan scientists plan another study to see if it would be more effective to give nevirapine to mother and infant for longer periods. Also, a continuing study in the United States and Europe aims to determine if adding nevirapine to standard regimens will further lower the transmission rate of H.I.V. from mother to child. Dr. Fauci said there was no need to change the United States recommendations until more studies are completed.
The United Nations AIDS group estimates that 1,800 babies are born H.I.V.-infected every day in developing countries where most women do not receive prenatal care. In some areas of Africa, up to 40 percent of pregnant women are H.I.V. infected, and from 25 percent to 35 percent of their infants will be born infected if therapy is not provided.
Wide-scale use of nevirapine in developing countries "could potentially prevent 300,000 to 400,000 newborns each year from beginning life infected with H.I.V.," Dr. Fauci said.
AZT and other anti-H.I.V. drugs have drastically reduced mother-to-child transmission of the infection in the United States since 1994, when a federally sponsored study showed that AZT, taken for several weeks, could stop mother-to-child transmission of H.I.V. The American regimen calls for the pregnant woman to take AZT five times a day beginning as early as the 14th week of pregnancy and continuing until labor, when an intravenous injection of AZT is given. At birth, the baby takes AZT four times a day for six weeks.
Because the American regimen was impractical and too costly for third world countries, scientists sought a more affordable therapy.
Researchers initially intended to enroll 1,500 women in the study, conducted at Mulago Hospital and Makerere University in Kampala, Uganda, beginning in November 1997. One part of the study was dropped in February 1998 after another United States-financed study conducted in Thailand found that AZT used for a shorter period than in the United States was effective in preventing mother-to-child transmission of H.I.V.
The Ugandan study then involved 618 women in their ninth month of pregnancy who had not taken anti-H.I.V. drugs and their 631 infants. Of the 618 women, 308 took AZT and 310 took nevirapine. Enrollment stopped at the end of last April.
The women agreed to accept by random selection either of two drug regimens. One regimen was single dose nevirapine therapy for mother and infant. The other regimen involved taking two AZT pills at the onset of labor and then one pill every three hours until delivery. Infants born to mothers who took AZT were given AZT twice a day during the first week of life.
After two months, 59 infants born to mothers who took AZT and 35 infants born to mothers who took nevirapine were infected. Statistical tests projected the 25 percent and 13 percent infection rates, respectively.
The three deaths that occurred among mothers who took AZT were due to AIDS and not the drug, the researchers said. No deaths occurred among the mothers who took nevirapine.
Infection was the most common cause of adverse effects and death among the infants whose mothers took the two drugs. The adverse effects and deaths were not deemed drug related.
Scientists learned the findings on Monday at a meeting of a committee that oversees the safety and effectiveness of such studies.

HEADLINE: Khatami's Key Moment

BYLINE: By Reuel Marc Gerecht; Reuel Marc Gerecht is a former Middle East specialist in the Central Intelligence Agency. Under the pseudonym of Edward Shirley, he is the author of "Know Thine Enemy, A Spy's Journey Into Revolutionary Iran."

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
As any American who can remember the 1979-80 hostage crisis in Iran knows, students were indispensable to the victory of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini's revolutionary ideas. Unfortunately for the clerical regime, today's protesting students have become harbingers of a counterrevolution.
No one should be fooled by yesterday's orchestrated backlash, in which thousands showed their displeasure with the student demonstrators. Even if the students do not take to the streets again, they have already caused the most severe crisis of confidence the ruling mullahs have faced since the disastrous last days of the Iran-Iraq war in 1988. Ever more explicitly seeking a pluralist democracy, the student demonstrators may soon force President Mohammad Khatami -- who unexpectedly won the presidency in 1997 because he was seen as the first possible alternative to theocratic dictatorship -- to define and defend his "civil society" under the "rule of law." 
 The clerical regime has always been sensitive to the dangers of higher education. For more than 20 years, students and faculty members at Iran's universities, particularly Teheran University, have been monitored and purged for "un-Islamic" behavior. Admission criteria and financial aid were altered to favor prospective students who demonstrated revolutionary faithfulness and military service.
Poor young men who had served in the Revolutionary Guard Corps or the paramilitary mobilization force, the Basij, flooded into Iran's universities, often becoming determined, if poorly prepared, students. Preferential treatment for the children of mullahs, revolution-loyal administrators and members of the Guard and the Basij further solidified the hold of the revolutionary classes on Iran's universities. Teheran University became the Friday-prayer pulpit for the most influential mullahs.
With the faithful poor and lower-middle classes dominating Iran's universities, the clerics believed -- hoped -- they'd neutralized the most dangerous incubators of Western ideas. However, the growth of various university student associations, whose secular nature and objectives became clearer and more open in the 1990's, revealed that the "Islamicization" of the university system was hollow.
Love of education and curiosity about the outside world -- traits found even among the country's most retrograde clerics -- kept alive provocative inquiry in higher education. The Islamic Republic's defeat in the war against Iraq and its rampant corruption and awful economy also helped to cast doubt even among the most faithful students.
It's not coincidental that the most serious and feared dissent in Iran is in the universities and the traditional clerical schools. Both places naturally create fraternities and friendships not easily invaded and traduced by state power.
More important, both institutions can produce leaders. The clerical regime has been very thoughtful and savage in diminishing or eliminating alternative leaders. Those student leaders who have recently been gaining eminence have already been jailed.
Directionless, the widespread popular loathing of the ruling clergy hasn't seriously challenged the status quo. Though the current student demonstrations have not been particularly well organized and sometimes were spontaneous, compared with the earlier explosions of popular disgust in the Islamic Republic they have seemed almost stage-managed.
But there also might be wisdom in this low-level revolt. Iran's student leaders have not jettisoned the language of an Islamic state, and their demands have usually been specific and practicable. They have begun to push the envelope by questioning the legitimacy of the current revolutionary leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, but like most Iranians, who are still scarred by the violence of revolution and war, they appear to have no desire for a bloodbath.
Though the students are still loudly backing the President, they are beginning to express some dismay about his reluctance to defend more forcefully the reformist camp that brought him to power. Mr. Khatami's abrupt shift in tone on Tuesday, when he denounced the demonstrators, can only increase the students' unease.
President Khatami's forces are supposed to make the February 2000 national elections the hard-liners' Waterloo. With this contest, the President is supposed to finally make a stand and stop the hardcore faction from rigging the election by restricting the "qualified" candidates primarily to its own.
The Islamic revolution was in part premised on young men and women being able to find true happiness only through a moral order that circumscribed their individual freedom. The students have now explicitly shredded this unwritten contract between themselves and their spiritual chaperones, the ruling mullahs. They may give Mr. Khatami until Feb. 20, 2000, to frame a new covenant. It remains to be seen whether he will live up to their hopes.

HEADLINE: FAMILY FARE;
A Reach For the Sky

BYLINE: By Laurel Graeber 

 BODY:
Many small steps will be taken across Central Park tomorrow evening, all in honor of a giant leap for mankind. Children will frolic on Sheep's Meadow at the Urban Park Rangers' Moon Day festivities, a celebration of all things lunar (and a few things Martian, too).
"We'll have a lot of interesting creatures, perhaps Martians, milling about," said Meredith Caccese, the Rangers' special events coordinator. 
 But expect them to be upstaged by an earthling. The event, which will commemorate the 30th anniversary of the Apollo 11 moon landing (July 20), will feature Edwin E. (Buzz) Aldrin Jr., whose footsteps definitely fall into the giant-leap category. An Apollo 11 astronaut and the second man to walk on the moon (Neil Armstrong was the first), Mr. Aldrin will reminisce about his adventures.
The Rangers will also show the original CBS broadcast of the landing, and Michael Light, the author of "Full Moon" (Alfred A. Knopf, $50), a collection of moon mission photographs, will sign copies of his book. The Amateur Astronomers Association will set up telescopes, and Neil deGrasse Tyson, director of the Hayden Planetarium, will give a family-style star talk, Ms. Caccese said.
Omega, the watch manufacturer, is to exhibit space memorabilia, including the Apollo 11 crew's watches and replicas of Mr. Armstrong's spacesuit, the Lunar Rover and the Mars Sojourner, which flew in 1997. It will also raffle off a limited-edition Apollo 11 commemorative watch.
The Raptor Trust will even give a live owl presentation, which isn't as incongruous as it sounds. Since screech owls were released into Central Park only last year, they presumably know a thing or two about flying into uncharted territory.
 
Moon Day, sponsored by Target, tomorrow from 8 to 10 P.M. at Sheep's Meadow, Central Park (enter at 67th Street and Central Park West), (888) 697-2757 or (800) 201-7275. Free.

It's no accident that the main characters in Tada's latest production are named Judy and Mickey. Appropriately called "Golly Gee Whiz!," the musical captures the high spirits of 1930's pop culture, when stars like Judy Garland and Mickey Rooney were all the rage, and wide-eyed optimism was supposed to cure the blues, not to mention the Depression.
The action takes place in 1939 in Happyville, where the teen-agers decide to boost the economy by putting on a show. As they brainstorm, what could have been pure saccharine turns into a very funny spoof, thanks to the imaginations of the authors, Eric Rockwell and Joanne Bogart, the cleverness of the director and choreographer, Cynthia Thole, and the lack of self-consciousness of Tada's 8- to 17-year-old thespians.
Mac (Bobby Lugo) is so smitten with Edith (Robin Atwell), the costume mistress, that he agrees to be her live mannequin, donning a Carmen Miranda-type getup for a hilarious love-duet-cum-tango. Another scene ends comically when Freddie Finkelhoffer (Norman Franklin), the stage manager, suddenly metamorphoses into a barkeep, producing a consolation cocktail (an ice cream soda) as Judy (Julia Adolphe) sings of her troubles. She's sure that Mickey (Alexander Iwachiw), the high school impresario, has fallen for a temperamental visiting star, Deanna Saprana (Samantha Delgatto).
The musical, which evokes everything from swing to Cole Porter, will introduce young theatergoers to unfamiliar rhythms as well as a new vocabulary. But most of all "Golly Gee Whiz!" will prove that the Happyville folks are right: there's no underestimating the power of youngsters to put on a rousing show.
 
"Golly Gee Whiz!," through Aug. 1 at Tada, 120 West 28th Street, Chelsea, (212) 627-1732. Performances: Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Fridays at noon and 2 P.M. ; Saturdays and Aug. 1 at 1 and 3 P.M. Tickets: $12; ages 15 and under, $6. Reservations advised.
 
Youthful Reflections
Charles Lutwidge Dodgson, better known as Lewis Carroll, surely would have agreed that Wonderland existed long before he created it. To Carroll, childhood itself was a Wonderland, a world that beckoned not only him but also many other photographers and artists, from Juliet Cameron to Ellen Phelan.
Their work can be seen in "Through the Looking Glass," an exhibition on view through Oct. 3 at the Newhouse Center for Contemporary Art on Staten Island. And on Sunday, the most astute critics of such art -- children themselves -- will be invited to use it as inspiration.
The occasion is a family program that links activities, from frame-making to drawing, to the works on display. For instance, the Adventure Event will be near toy installations by Jarvis Rockwell (Norman Rockwell's son): children will use paper, string, cellophane, pipe cleaners and tiny props to create dioramas. At the Picture Yourself Collage Table, they will work with both images of consumer culture and illustrations from "Alice in Wonderland."
"The Adventure Event will probably be for older kids who know about perspective," said Melissa Hiller, the center's public programs manager. "The Dress-Up Corner is more for younger kids to dream and create."
The event will offer six activity stations, as well as copious source material. Toys, it seems, fire the imagination well beyond childhood.
 
Family Day, Sunday from noon to 5 P.M. at the Newhouse Center for Contemporary Art, Snug Harbor Cultural Center, 1000 Richmond Terrace, Livingston, Staten Island, (718) 448-2500, ext. 254. Suggested donation: $2; $1 fee for some activities.

HEADLINE: ART REVIEW;
An Ode To Old Age, Life's Gift

BYLINE: By ROBERTA SMITH 

 BODY:
AT the age of 59, Marcia Tucker is bidding farewell to the New Museum of Contemporary Art in her usual style. Her swan song at the museum she single-handedly founded 22 years ago is "The Time of Our Lives," an exhibition that is characteristically personal, topical, rough around the edges and intent on raising consciousness.
Alternately sappy and insightful, this exhibition ignores most esthetic issues and instead brings together a broad array of art and artifacts -- from paintings to television commercials -- pertaining to a complex human and social theme: growing old. The result is less an art exhibition than a multifaceted learning experience; therein lie its weaknesses as well as its intermittent strengths. 
 Aging is a condition from which no one who is lucky enough to live so long escapes, a condition that many, American women in particular, view with sometimes crippling, self-negating, if self-indulgent despair. With increased life expectancy and the graying of the immense baby boomer generation, aging is an ever more visible fact of American life, a subject of study on many fronts and an economic factor as well.
Geriatric specialists are on the rise in the medical profession. "Age theory" has become a subject for scholars and cultural critics who are dovetailing it with existing theories about race, gender and identity. Aging is more and more a subject of television specials, talk shows and articles in fashion magazines; a spur to the cosmetics and health industries and the building of both retirement communities and "old age" residences.
Despite these developments, however, ours is a profoundly youth-oriented culture that often seems to believe that the aged should be neither seen nor heard. Ageism, as Ms. Tucker points out in her spirited catalogue essay, is a prejudice like any other. It permeates our lives from birth, affecting everything from Government policy to popular culture and the media. Youth is equated with beauty, aging with death.
As a crude measure of how society views aging, we have only to consider the rather short professional life of the Hollywood actress, the paradigm of youth and beauty, and the interesting actresses on the far side of 40 who have not appeared in a movie in years. Ms. Tucker means for her exhibition to take a look at all this and in particular how society's notions about age affect women's views of themselves.
The works of art, film and video on view here mostly confront the joys or sorrows of aging head-on; others address the obsession with youth or the passage of time itself. Also on view on different monitors throughout the show are pertinent television commercials and sitcoms, including the famous 1972 segments of "Maude," in which the 47-year-old Maude (Bea Arthur) discovers to her horror that she is pregnant; and "When You're Hot, You're Hot" and "Edith's Problem," segments from "Cybill" and "All in the Family," respectively, in which lead characters confront menopause.
Most of the museum's ground-floor galleries are devoted to a display of 35 works by 21 artists, some well known and some less familiar, two-thirds of whom are women. Images of the aging female body, usually nude, predominate.
The show opens with Jeff Wall's glowing Duratran-box image of the interior of a modern library into which he has digitally inserted the colossal image of a naked older woman who towers over the library visitors.
She stands on the landing of a sleekly 20th-century double staircase, much the way an idealized statue of a Greek god might occupy a landing on the marble staircase of a library at an old, established men's college -- a symbol of pride, beauty and cultural accomplishment so thoroughly taken for granted that no one bothers to look at it anymore.
Across the way is Lisa Yuskavage's "Manifest Destiny," a characteristically ambiguous image featuring one of the artist's libidinous vixens, shown here in the shadow of a tall, icy, columnlike woman, an idealized female who has in effect become her own pedestal. Next to it is Marina Abramovic's "Cleaning the Mirror II," a vanitas image in video that consists of a close-up of the artist lying naked beneath a human skeleton that shifts, coming ever so slightly to life, when she breathes.
Other works include a series of four photographs from Consuelo Castaneda's "Speed-Split" series in which the artist is seen from above lying beside her mother, their naked bodies tenderly curled together in a pose that is both fetal and suggestive of the "spooning" of lovers; Nancy Burson's heartrending photographs of children suffering from progeria, a rare genetic disorder that ages them prematurely, and "70 + 1," a startlingly three-dimensional full-length hologram self-portrait by Harriet Casdin-Silver, in which the 71-year-old artist stands tall (balanced on one foot), while cupping her breasts.
One of Cindy Sherman's best-known "Sex" series images further reminds us that desire is not the exclusive domain of youth. It shows an old hag, constructed from prosthetic body parts, giving birth to a string of sausages, a mad, toothless grin on her face. Jacqueline Hayden makes a similar point in a large untitled black and white photograph from her "Figure Model" series, which quotes the pose of Venus and Cupid -- he pinches her nipple -- from Bronzino's "Venus, Cupid, Folly and Time," recasting them as a dignified elderly man and woman.
Like many photographs and portraits of elderly people, these images suggest that spirit and flesh are separate entities, with their own distinct time lines. But the scale and nakedness of the figures here give the notion a visceral force. This is nowhere more apparent than in the large black and white photographs from Manabu Yamanaka's "Gyahtei" series at the end of the exhibition.
Each is a life-size image of an elderly nude Japanese woman whose shriveled, shrunken body makes the ravages of time shockingly palpable. But in each case the eye is drawn to their open, animated faces. These images also reflect the great respect accorded old people in Asian cultures, which in China and Japan in particular include frequent artistic portrayals of ancient beings in a host of roles, as sages, ancestors, beggars and mischievous spirits.
Ms. Tucker is not above a cheerful heavy-handedness when it comes to tweaking the details of her show to reflect its theme. The exhibition's seating consists entirely of thickly cushioned glider-rocking chairs, ghastly to look at but heavenly to sit in. (Literally, you'll feel airborne.) Throughout her long acknowledgments and in the requisite lists of the museum's staff members and board of trustees in the catalogue, the names are almost always followed by their ages, her own included.
The catalogue also includes comments about aging excerpted from Ms. Tucker's diary, starting at age 15. And just in case we haven't grasped society's distorted views of the old, adjacent to Mr. Yamanaka's photographs hangs a full-length mirror in which visitors can see their own reflections. The primary weakness here, as in most subject-driven shows, is that regardless of quality, the art on view almost inevitably functions as mere illustration of the larger theme. You could say that everything here is either part of the problem or part of the solution, and either way subsumed within the larger mood of piousness, public service and pedagogy.
The works that elude this condition tend to be found in the exhibition's video and film portions.
It is only amid moving images accompanied by spoken words or music that the richness of the subject of aging comes truly to life. Worthwhile works include Carol Halstead's "Why," a mostly computer-animated collage that recounts her life's story in 16 action-packed minutes, and Gail Noonan's playfully caustic, beautifully drawn animated short film, "Your Name in Cellulite."
Sometimes the films have the egalitarian, thrown-together feel of the show itself. A prime example is "Whisper, the Waves, the Wind," by Suzanne Lacy, a California artist known for organizing and filming participatory performance pieces. This particular work, best described as a living Christo with Felliniesque undertones, involved 150 women between the ages of 60 and 99, who dressed in the white garments of their choice and converged on a beach near La Jolla.
There, they gathered at white tables and talked about their lives, creating a ready-made grass-roots documentary full of vivid glimpses of personalities, lives and hard-won wisdom.
But the film program also includes impeccably thought-through and structured works of art, like Yvonne Rainer's 1990 "Privilege," which shows Ms. Rainer's resonant style -- a slow-moving but riveting mixture of paradocumentary and popular film clips, theory and humorous self-reference, dramatic flashbacks and quiet conversation -- at its best.
The subject here is menopause, but the film weaves its theme into an intricate transparent web that probes racism of the most subtle sort (between women of different races, for example), the role of racial prejudice and class in sexual attraction, and women's ambivalence about being objectified. Throughout, a string of medical authorities, seen in old documentaries, demonstrate their pathetic ignorance of menopause, women and aging.
Ms. Tucker's exhibition provides a kind of aerial view of the changing landscape of thought about aging that tells us repeatedly that this condition is not a burden, but a gift to be savored and appreciated to the benefit of all. It does this in ways that veer from simplistic to complex. As Ms. Rainer's film confirms, complex is better.
 
"The Time of Our Lives," is at the New Museum of Contemporary Art, 583 Broadway, between Prince and Houston Streets, (212) 219-1222, SoHo, through Oct. 17.

To the Editor: 
 In calling for American companies to open facilities in depressed areas, President Clinton would do well to recognize that most corporations are hesitant to do this because they believe a large segment of the population in those areas lacks necessary education and job skills (letters, July 11). While he should encourage private investment there, the Small Business Administration should set up business centers in each depressed area to manufacture products and services to be bought by the Government. These centers could provide training and jobs, such as printing Government forms and redesigning Government computers for use in public schools and prisons, that would offer the wages needed to pull area residents out of poverty.

HEADLINE: Coca-Cola Earnings Fall 21%, Reflecting Troubles in Europe

BYLINE: By CONSTANCE L. HAYS 

 BODY:
In part because it had to pull millions of soft drinks off the market in Europe last month, the Coca-Cola Company's second-quarter profit fell 21 percent, the company said yesterday.
In the quarter ended June 30, net income dropped to $942 million, or 38 cents a diluted share, compared with $1.19 billion, or 48 cents a share, in the quarter a year earlier. 
 Worldwide sales volume, measured in cases of finished drinks, fell 2 percent, compared with a 10 percent increase in the period a year earlier. The company appears to be spending heavily on marketing even as volume declines. It reported that revenue rose 4 percent, to $5.38 billion from $5.15 billion, but that sales, administrative and general expenses increased 10 percent.
The volume and earnings were about what Wall Street had expected, and Coke shares rose $2.125, closing at $64.
It was the fourth consecutive quarter in which Coke reported a decline in earnings, but analysts seemed to take the results in stride.
"The good news is, there's no incremental bad news," said Jennifer Solomon, a beverage analyst with Salomon Smith Barney.
Nevertheless, Coca-Cola's top management, including its chairman and chief executive, M. Douglas Ivester, has scheduled an unusual meeting with analysts and investors in New York on Thursday. Topics on the agenda include the recall in Europe, global business conditions and Coke's growth outlook.
In a statement yesterday, the company said the recall, which began in Belgium on June 14 with hundreds of people saying they became ill after drinking Coke products and spread to France, Luxembourg and the Netherlands, was a factor in its performance. About 17 million cases of Coke products had to be recalled and destroyed.
In addition, two plants in Belgium and a third in France were shut down while Coca-Cola sought to determine what had made people ill. The company concluded that a flawed batch of carbon dioxide, used to carbonate its soft drinks, from a Belgian plant may have caused a bad smell in one set of products and that a phenol compound used to protect shipping crates in the French plant may have done the same thing. But in both cases, Coca-Cola maintained that the substances it detected were present in amounts too tiny to have made anyone ill.
The recall's effect on Coca-Cola's earnings was 2 to 3 cents a share, the company said.
While volume fell 6 percent in European markets, it declined in many other places, as well. In China, volume dropped 9 percent, a decline the company attributed to severe flooding in the eastern part of the country last month and to the fallout from the bombing by the United States of the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade, Yugoslavia.
In India, volume rose 2 percent, far less than in the second quarter of 1998, when it grew 33 percent. Again, the weather was at fault, Coca-Cola said, noting that the early monsoons decreased sales near the end of the quarter. Over all, volume fell 2 percent in the Middle East and East Asian division.
Volume was flat in Latin America, compared with a 12 percent increase in the second quarter last year, and sales in countries like Venezuela and Colombia continued to slide. In Africa, volume fell 1 percent, mostly in the southern part of the continent, where the company said unrest in Zimbabwe and economic weakness in South Africa drove down demand.
In the United States, volume fell 1 percent, compared with an 8 percent increase in the period a year earlier.
In Japan, one of Coke's largest markets, volume grew 6 percent, a turnaround from a 3 percent decline in the second quarter last year.
Equity income, from bottlers in which Coca-Cola holds a stake, has fallen 83 percent so far this year, the company said. That pace is ahead of last year's, when equity income decreased 79 percent, a reflection of the sales slowdowns that bottlers are encountering.
"The equity-income line was supposed to be a nice contributor to earnings growth," said Emanuel Goldman, a global consumer products analyst for Merrill Lynch. "It's backward now." Of the quarter as a whole, he added: "It's like Zeus was hurling thunderbolts at them, and Zeus worked for Pepsi."

HEADLINE: Inflation Didn't Budge in June, U.S. Says

BYLINE: By SYLVIA NASAR 

 BODY:
In the middle of the ninth year of one of the longest economic booms in United States history, the rate of inflation is precisely zero.
In June, the Labor Department reported yesterday, the closely watched Consumer Price Index -- which measures changes in the price of everything that American households buy, from candy bars to health care -- failed to register even the tiniest change. 
 This second consecutive month of no change in the index provides a moment as rare as it is sweet. Back-to-back zeroes (or outright declines) have shown up just twice in the post-World War II era: once in the spring of 1986, amid a stunning collapse in world oil prices, and the other time in the winter of 1962, long before Americans learned to regard inflation as one of life's fixtures, like death and taxes.
"In some sense, we're back to the 50's," said Jeffrey Frankel, an economist at the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University.
The underlying trend in prices is still up slightly. Prices are 2 percent higher today than they were a year ago. But that is actually a slower inflation pace than earlier.
Some important items, notably oil, have become more costly. After falling for four consecutive years, energy prices jumped more than 24 percent in the first six months of 1999.
Most important, the "core" inflation rate -- which excludes the volatile food and energy prices -- has risen more slowly in the first half of this year than it did in 1998, at an annual rate of 1.6 percent versus 2.4 percent. The core rate edged up just a tenth of a percent last month.
"It's hard to search back and find a time when things were this good," said Patrick Jackman, a senior economist at the Labor Department who supervises the Government's monthly survey of retail prices.
Yesterday's inflation news cheered stock and bond investors, who have lately been worried that the Federal Reserve was about to turn down the party music -- as it did in 1994 and 1995 when it engineered an increase of three percentage points in short-term interest rates to take the edge off the country's exuberance. Although the Fed did nudge a key rate up a bit last month, investors are now more optimistic that the central bank will leave it at that.
Separately, the Government reported yesterday that jobless claims increased 11,000, to 310,000, for the week that ended on July 10. That was the highest number in a month, but still a level indicating a healthy job market.
The good news on inflation has inspired a fascinating conundrum: not so much why inflation drifted down in the 1990's as why it has not crept up recently as unemployment has remained at its lowest level in decades.
"Before the last six months, prices were behaving the way that the conventional wisdom said they should," said Alan S. Blinder, an economist at Princeton University who was vice chairman of the Fed in the mid-1990's. "But now we really have some explaining to do."
To see why, consider a bit of history. In the early 1980's, inflation fell to 4 percent from 10 percent the old-fashioned way, squeezed out of the economy by tight money and a deep recession engineered by the Fed, whose chairman then was Paul A. Volcker. By the end of the 1980's boom, it had moved back up to a 6 percent rate. That is when Alan Greenspan, who became Fed chairman in 1987, administered a smaller dose of castor oil, pushing rates higher and helping send the economy into a brief, relatively shallow recession that ended in early 1991. Inflation fell to 3 percent. Tighter money in 1994 and 1995 knocked another point off the rate.
No mystery there.
At that point, most experts expected inflation to pick up as unemployment kept dropping. But then came a shower of good luck. The dollar strengthened, making imports cheaper. Energy prices fell. The relentless rise in health care costs was interrupted as many employers shifted to health maintenance organizations. Computer prices, which had been dropping 10 to 15 percent a year, suddenly began declining at twice that rate.
At the same time, the Government made changes in the way it measures consumer prices. In particular, it began to do a much better job of picking up improvements in product quality. That alone knocked more than half a percentage point off the official inflation rate.
In other words, still no mystery.
Today, however, most of the factors that held inflation down -- falling energy prices, for example -- are no longer in force. Yet inflation continues to shrink. Most remarkably, pay increases -- typically the most important ingredient in any lasting upturn in inflation -- have moderated in recent months in the midst of the tightest labor market in memory.
One explanation for the apparent absence of inflation is a surprising burst of productivity growth at a point in the business cycle when bottlenecks typically start to appear and companies get sloppy.
Nobody knows for sure if the situation will last. Allan Meltzer, a professor of economics at Carnegie Mellon University, is not alone in arguing that inflation will turn up as soon as the rest of the world's economies are back on track.
But there is another possibility -- perhaps Americans have finally stopped believing that inflation is inevitable. In the 1970's, Robert Lucas, a Nobel laureate, made the radical suggestion that if the Fed could quell expectations of inflation by announcing a credible game plan, inflation might disappear painlessly, without high unemployment. His conservative theory did not fare well in the initially painful unwinding of inflation.
But now it looks as if, at long last, Mr. Greenspan's credibility and America's trust in him may be turning into a self-fulfilling prophecy.

HEADLINE: The Parade Of Corporate Sponsors;
Marketers Line Up to Link Their Names to Events

BYLINE: By EDWIN McDOWELL 

DATELINE: PORTLAND, Ore.

 BODY:
The recent Portland Rose Festival began with events like the Starlight Parade through downtown -- make that the Portland General Electric/Solv Starlight Parade Presented by Southwest Airlines.
Midway through the festival, which ran for 25 days in June, came an auto race. To be precise, Texaco/ Havoline Presents the Budweiser/G.I. Joe's 200, a FedEx Championship Series Event. 
 Similarly, in Phoenix, the Microage Fiesta Bowl Parade precedes the annual Tostito Fiesta Bowl Football Classic.
No, corporate sponsorship of special events is not a new phenomenon. But often, these days, you can barely find the event for the sponsors.
Unadorned titles -- like the Indianapolis 500 and the Rose Parade -- have truly become an endangered species, as one event after another goes the way of the Kodak Albuquerque International Balloon Fiesta, Sunoco Welcome America! in Philadelphia and the Hooters Hula Bowl in Hawaii. Even that New Year's Day football game in Pasadena, Calif., has become the AT&T Rose Bowl.
And to top it off, the single-sponsor event is rapidly giving way to the likes of the U S West Rose Festival Air Show Presented by Intel.
"Fifteen years ago, fewer than 25 percent of festivals and events had some corporate involvement; today it's up to 85 percent," said Lesa Ukman, president of Chicago-based IEG Inc., which tracks sponsorship of events, sports, arts and entertainment.
"In the early days, festivals and events organizers would go hat in hand asking for support," she said. "Now they can show companies they're offering them a cost-effective way to increase sales and marketing objectives."
Anything, it seems, is fair game. "Almost every category of event you can think of now has sponsors," said Dennis Boese, corporate manager of fair and festival marketing for the Miller Brewing Company.
Miller, a unit of the Philip Morris Companies, sponsors almost 90 events, from the Kentucky Derby Festival in Louisville to the Sant 'Yago Night Parade in Tampa, Fla., to the Official Shrimporee of Texas in Aransas Pass, Tex.
Miller's target audience, Mr. Boese said, is men ages 21 to 35, so it backs many sports events -- but not the Portland Rose Festival, where Budweiser sponsors the auto race, and a local company, Rogue Ales, is the official microbrewery.
Sponsorship money is necessary, festival organizers say, to offset the increasing cost of entertainment, to hold ticket prices down and to finance the expansion into events needed to appeal to a wide audience. The 91-year-old Rose Festival, for example, has grown from a 2-day carnival in 1907 to a 25-day gala with 74 events and more than two million spectators.
But not everyone is pleased with what some specialists in tourism, including Dennis R. Judd, describe as "the McDonaldization of local events," of "making them look more and more like a Disney production."
Mr. Judd -- a professor of political science at the University of Missouri-St. Louis and co-author of "The Tourist City" (Yale University Press) -- said that as festivals increasingly rely on corporate sponsorship, they lose their local identity. "Before long, they resemble events everywhere else," he said.
Corporate sponsorship accounts for 35 percent of the Rose Festival's $8 million budget; the remainder comes from concession sales and admission to events.
According to Dean Runyan Associates, a travel-industry research firm, the festival's overall economic impact in the Portland area reached $79 million in 1996 -- the last year for which figures are available -- up from $44 million in 1988.
This year, corporations will spend an estimated $685 million on festivals, fairs and annual events, according to IEG. That may be only 9 percent of the estimated $7.6 billion that will be spent on sponsorships in 1999 -- two-thirds of the total will go to auto racing, golf and other sports ing events. Still, it is triple the amount spent on fairs and festivals a decade ago, and $107 million more than last year.
Moreover, the events that corporations are willing to sponsor have become more varied. Thus, the Rose Festival has attracted more than 200 sponsors: 150 paid at least $5,000 each and 7 provided contributions worth six figures.
Leading Rose Festival sponsors included Southwest Airlines; the General Motors Pontiac division; the Pepsi-cola unit of Pepsico; Dollar Thrifty Automotive Group's Thrifty Rent-A-Car division, and Deloitte & Touche. The U S West Rose Festival Presented by Intel had 20 other sponsors, including Coors Light, Pepsi, Candlewood Hotel's Candlewood Suites unit and G.M.
In addition, the festival boasted an official iced tea (Unilever's Lipton brand), sportswear company (Columbia Sportswear), coffee (Millstone), wine (Willamette Valley Vineyards) and messenger service (Pronto). The latter three are local or regional companies, as is the plumbing supply company that sponsored a Festival of Bands competition, the pancake and steak house that sponsored a jazz band competition and the dairy that sponsored milk-carton boat races for children.
In the sponsorship pecking order, the most valuable, and expensive, position is title sponsor. That is the corporation whose name comes before the name of the event -- like Portland General Electric for the Starlight Parade, U S West for the air show, and Southwest Airlines for the floral parade.
When an event is "presented by," the presenting sponsor's name follows the event -- at a smaller cost than being title sponsor. The Rose Festival does not disclose how much its sponsors pay, but sponsorship of a breakfast for several hundred could cost more than $25,000 at a major festival, elaborate parade floats easily cost $40,000, while title sponsorship of an air show ranges from $200,000 to as much as $350,000.
Southwest Airlines' sponsorship strategy is somewhat unusual, in view of its relatively limited route system. For one thing, its 30 or more sponsorships include designation as the official airline of both the Super Bowl and National Football League, even though it does not fly to every N.F.L. city.
Similarly, months before it began service here in 1994, Southwest sent a team of almost a dozen people to see what events it could sponsor that were important to the community. It quickly settled on the Rose Festival. When Delta Air Lines dropped its six-year sponsorship of the Grand Floral Parade after the 1994 festival, Southwest moved in.
"Our strategy is to be a major sponsor of events that connect with customers," said Linda Rutherford, a Southwest spokeswoman. "So before we agree to sponsor anything, we spend a lot of time in a community talking with movers and shakers and travelers."
Wells Fargo, based in San Francisco, participates in everything from the California Strawberry Festival in Oxnard to Gold Rush Days in Wickenburg, Ariz., to the San Francisco Ballet and the Southwestern Exposition and Livestock Show in Fort Worth. In Portland, it is the sole sponsor of the Italian Festival and summer concerts at the zoo two nights a week.
"We want to sponsor things that will draw the largest number of families," said George J. Passadore, president of the 121 Wells Fargo banks in Oregon.
After it had participated in the Rose Festival for 51 years, First Interstate Bank was bought by Wells Fargo & Company in 1996 and dropped its sponsorships.
But after Wells Fargo was taken over by the Norwest Corporation in November, decisions were decentralized; Mr. Passadore, who spent 37 years with First Interstate, wasted little time reconnecting with the Rose Festival -- now under the Wells Fargo banner.
This year's Wells Fargo float won the Governor's Trophy for best craftsmanship and workmanship, and 275 Wells employees were prominent among the festival's 5,000 volunteers. While volunteers have long been mainstays of local events, Professor Judd said, they are being squeezed out of local and regional events by professional consultants whose mandate is to make them bigger, if not necessarily better.
By most accounts, few companies realized the potential of corporate sponsorship, other than for sports events, until the 1984 Olympic Games in Los Angeles.
"That was the key," said Bruce Skinner, president of the International Festivals and Events Association. "Before that, corporate involvement was typically in the form of donations."
Among the first to realize that broader potential, Ms. Ukman said, was George Wein, the one-time Boston nightclub owner who founded the Newport Jazz Festival in 1954. In 1972 he created the Schlitz Salute to Jazz, eventually bringing Kool cigarettes, American Express, Toyota and JVC into the corporate fold.
Now, with the opportunity to get their name in the title, on floats, on signs, billboards and ticket stubs, corporations increasingly participate in events big and small.
But no one knows better than festival officials that corporate sponsors can be fickle. "Sometimes they pull out because of a change in their marketing strategy, or a downturn in their industry or in the economy," Mr. Clark of the Rose Festival said. "Then there are mergers, or a company moves away."
Last month, the Eastman Kodak Company said it would soon end its 62-year sponsorship of the Kodak Hula Show in Honolulu. The free event, started by Kodak in 1937 and shown twice a week, costs the company more than $500,000 a year. A Kodak spokesman said that the show draws older visitors while the company hopes to attract younger people interested in photography.
Southwest Airlines has also changed its mind on occasion. After sponsoring the Texas State Fair parade for many years, it pulled out in 1996. "We had enough recognition among Texans," Ms. Rutherford said, "so we decided to put that sponsorship money into other things."

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: BONDS;
Investors Buy $1.6 Billion Of Municipal Debt Issues

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Municipal bond investors stole center stage in bond trading yesterday as they quickly bought up $1.6 billion of tax-exempt bonds backed by toll revenue from a Southern California highway.
In the largest tax-free bond offering this year, underwriters led by Salomon Smith Barney handled the sale by the Foothill/Eastern Transportation Agency and had good demand from institutional buyers, including mutual funds. 
 The sale included $831.3 million of interest-bearing bonds as well as the more scarce zero coupon bonds, which provide no income in the interim but pay out all of the tax- exempt interest in a lump sum at maturity. Some bonds are rated triple-A because the interest and principal are insured, while uninsured portions are rated Baa-3 by Moody's Investors Service and BBB by the Standard & Poor's Corporation.
Market participants said the straight bonds were tentatively priced to yield 4.55 percent for an issue due in 2004 and to yield 5.25 percent for one due in 2016. A bond due in 2019 was priced to yield 5.35 percent and the longest, due in 2040, was priced to yield 5.80 percent. The zero coupon bonds were priced to yield from 5.85 percent to 6.125 percent, with maturities ranging from 2020 to 2038.
Another issue priced yesterday was the $138 million offering of general obligations bonds by Nassau County, N.Y. The county, recently stung by several cuts in its bond rating by both Moody's and S.& P., bought insurance that gave the bonds a triple-A rating.
Paine Webber won the issue in competitive bidding and resold the bonds at prices to yield 4.30 percent for an issue due 2003, and 5.35 percent in 2019.
Treasury securities were little changed after a report that the Consumer Price Index was unchanged in June for the second consecutive month, indicating tame inflation.
The yield of the benchmark 30-year bond was unchanged at 5.91 percent while its price, which moves in the opposite direction, fell 1/32, to 90 25/32.

HEADLINE: More Jobs and More Seekers, And Unemployment Inches Up

BYLINE: By LESLIE EATON 

 BODY:
The unemployment rate in New York City has been creeping up since March, and it reached 6.8 percent in June, according to data released yesterday by the State Department of Labor. Even so, the rate has been under 7 percent for four months -- the lowest levels since 1990.
"Any numbers below 7 percent are good," said John Tepper Marlin, the chief economist for the City Comptroller's office. He said the city's jobless rate had declined sharply in the last year, falling from 7.7 percent in June 1998, while the number of people looking for work dropped by 34,500. The figures are adjusted to account for seasonal factors. 
 Though the city's unemployment rate remains far above the national level of 4.3 percent, it has been falling far faster; nationally, unemployment has edged down from 4.5 percent over the last year. For the rest of the state, excluding New York City, the unemployment rate is 4.2 percent.
New York City businesses are creating jobs faster than the national average, said James Brown, an analyst with the State Labor Department. In the city, the number of private-sector jobs is growing by 2.7 percent to 2.8 percent a year, compared with 2.5 percent nationwide.
Jobs at companies that provide services for businesses -- lawyers, accountants, temporary agencies, and advertising agencies -- have been growing rapidly, as have positions in retailing. Manufacturing continues to decline in the city, mostly because the clothing business has been even weaker than in previous years, Mr. Brown said.
With the local economy booming, it may seem puzzling that the unemployment rate is rising.
One reason is that more people are looking for work, Mr. Brown said. The labor force rose by about 20,000 in June as the school year ended and applicants sought jobs at businesses adding summer employees. "We always get an influx of job seekers in June, but this was a larger than average increase," he said.
Some economists also suggest that the sharp drop in March -- to 6.4 percent from 7.6 percent -- may have resulted from problems with the statistical sample or the model used to calculate the unemployment rate. And they suggested that the rate might rebound a bit, as it has.
One concern for city officials is that while the number of jobs in the city has been surging over the last 18 months, the number of city residents with jobs has been growing more slowly. The gap between new jobs and city dwellers with new jobs was 50,000 last year, and 30,000 in the first six months of this year, Mr. Marlin of the City Comptroller's office said.
But in June, the number of city residents with jobs rose faster than the number of new jobs, he noted, and in years past, similar gaps were erased when the underlying statistics were revised. Another possibility is that many of the new jobs are being taken by commuters.
Within the city, the highest unemployment rate was in the Bronx, where the June jobless rate was 7.9 percent in figures unadjusted for seasonal changes. The rate was 7.6 percent in Brooklyn, 5.9 percent in Queens, 5.8 percent in Manhattan, and 5.5 percent in Staten Island. On Long Island, the rate averaged 3.4 percent in June.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: Market Place;
Stock index funds have finally started to lose their allure for investors seeking peak performances.

BYLINE: By Richard A. Oppel Jr. 

 BODY:
FICKLE, fickle.
The last few years investors have increasingly favored mutual stock funds that track stock market indexes, since few other funds have done better. 
 But the performance of competing funds -- run by stockpickers who try to beat the indexes -- has roared back this year, and investors have begun cutting back their purchases of index funds.
In the first three months of the year, about $3 of every $4 that flowed into stock mutual funds went to an index fund. In the second quarter, though, only about $1 of every $4 did, according to AMG Data Services, which tracks mutual funds.
There has been a decline in total net sales, too, though much milder. After a staggering $17.8 billion inflow in the first three months of the year, index funds took in just $12.3 billion in the second quarter, according to AMG. Their portion of new dollars fell more drastically because total net cash flows to the stock mutual funds tracked by AMG doubled in the second quarter. Fund industry officials say the latest figure was depressed slightly by a one-time shift in June of a large amount of money to an indexed portfolio outside the fund industry.
To be sure, index funds remain popular. Vanguard Group, the index-fund king, took in nearly twice as much money as any other fund family in the first five months of the year, according to the Financial Research Corporation of Boston.
Index funds are "still taking in money faster than the average equity fund," said Carl Wittnebert, director of research at Trimtabs.com Investment Research in Santa Rosa, Calif. "It's just not as lopsided as it was a few months back."
The recent slowdown has come as actively managed stock funds have begun beating indexes for the first time in years. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 28.6 percent last year -- twice the return of the average diversified stock fund. And in the first quarter of this year, the S.& P. 500 rose 5 percent, while the average diversified stock fund managed a measly 1.3 percent return.
But in April, the improving global economy and nosebleed valuations of some of the largest stocks in the S.& P. spurred investors to step up purchases of cyclical stocks and smaller-capitalization shares, providing an easier environment for stockpickers to beat their benchmarks. As a result, about two-thirds of mutual funds topped the S.& P.'s 7.1 percent return in the second quarter, according to Lipper Inc.
Benefiting from a recent strong performance and continuing contributions from existing shareholders, the giant Magellan fund run by the FMR Corporation's Fidelity Investments arm has set a record; yesterday the assets of the fund, which is closed, hit the $100 billion mark for the first time.
Robert Adler, AMG's president, is not sure if a shift in performance is the only factor at play or even whether index-fund sales will continue to slow. It would be bad for the stock market if the flows for index funds actually turned negative, he said.
The figures "indicate a slowing demand for these funds from the beginning of the year, but clearly the trend is not negative," he noted.
Brian Mattes, a Vanguard spokesman, said: "If anything is predictable, it is that cash flows follow tremendous performance. Indexing is a long-term strategy and one quarter, or a six-month period, or even a year of relative underperformance against active management is meaningless. Over the long term, indexing wins out.
"You can't buy yesterday's performance," he added, "but people want to do that."

HEADLINE: Laying Claim To Govern In the Ruins Of Kosovo

BYLINE: By JOHN KIFNER 

DATELINE: PRISTINA, Kosovo, July 15

 BODY:
Ibrahim Rugova, leader of a decade of principled, but largely futile, nonviolent resistance to Serbian domination, returned here today to a political landscape that was at once transformed and confused.
He has been criticized for appearing on television with Slobodan Milosevic, the Yugoslav President, in the midst of the brutal campaign to drive Albanians out of Kosovo. He has also faced criticism for failing to visit refugee camps and refusing to actively support the Kosovo Liberation Army's armed rebellion. But he received a warm welcome today from a cheering crowd as he arrived at the new United Nations headquarters here, accompanied by American diplomats, after flying via Macedonia from Italy, where he had stayed during much of the NATO bombing. 
 Even as Mr. Rugova held a crowded, sweaty and enigmatic news conference for a crush of foreign journalists this afternoon, the man who -- if all goes according to plan -- will really run Kosovo came to town with considerably less fanfare.
The man is Bernard Kouchner, the former French Government minister and leader of Doctors Without Borders, who is to be the chief civil administrator of the war-torn province.
"The priority is law and order, order and law," Mr. Kouchner said in a brief meeting with reporters.
It is a daunting task. His predecessor, Sergio Vieira de Mello, ended his brief tour in office by issuing a statement decrying Kosovo's postwar slide toward chaos despite the presence of more than 32,000 NATO peacekeeping troops.
"Killings, kidnapping, forced expulsions, house burnings and looting are a daily occurrence," directed at minorities, the statement said. "These are criminal acts. They cannot be excused by the suffering that has been inflicted in the past. Kosovo's future must be built on justice, not vengeance."
There are simply no Kosovo government institutions left. Kosovo, treasured in Serbian history and folklore, was the key to Mr. Milosevic's plan to seize power by unleashing Serbian nationalism In 1990, Mr. Milosevic ended Kosovo's constitutional autonomy, effectively firing the parliament and dismissing Albanians from jobs in government and state enterprises.
Under Mr. Rugova's leadership, Albanians resisted with a nonviolent "parallel society" holding school classes and even elections for a powerless parliament and president -- Mr. Rugova -- in their homes.
Milosevic loyalists and nationalists were the mayors and police chiefs for the most part, but these Serbs were swept away by the arrival of NATO troops a month ago. Kosovo Albanians, out of work for a decade, now want their old jobs back.
Into this void have come the United Nations and other international agencies like the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which is supposed to concentrate on developing democratic institutions; the European Union, focusing on physical rebuilding, and a host of lesser aid groups. So many hundreds of millions of dollars of aid have been pledged that senior international officials worry privately that the money cannot be effectively absorbed.
The United Nations operation here, which is carrying out the mandate of the Security Council, says it will determine what the law is, mostly old Yugoslav law except where that conflicts with European norms.
There are at least two other claims to a government. One is from Mr. Rugova, who drew an 80 percent turnout as the sole candidate in an underground election in March 1998, which was boycotted by his critics. The other is from his rival, Hashim Thaci, the rebel army leader who dominated the Albanian delegation at the Rambouillet peace conference in France, and who calls himself the president of the "provisional government."
As the rebel army gained popular support because of killings by Serbs, Mr. Rugova's stature here is believed to have declined. In recent weeks, however, the rebel force has appeared to be splitting into factions.
United Nations officials believe it will be about a year before elections can be held.
The United Nations is attempting to form a Kosovo Transitional Council of about a dozen people -- its final membership is still uncertain -- from various political parties and factions. Mr. Rugova and Mr. Thaci have both said they would join.
"We will cooperate with everybody and we will be represented on the international forums together," Mr. Rugova said.
Asked about his appearance with Mr. Milosevic during the war and rumors that he might have been drugged, Mr. Rugova replied, "That was not cooperation and it's over now."

HEADLINE: Excerpts From Debate on Lawsuits Over Health Care

BYLINE: By The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 15

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from remarks today by Senators Harry Reid of Nevada and Richard J. Durbin of Illinois, both Democrats, and Slade Gorton of Washington and Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania, Republicans, in the debate on a patients' bill of rights as transcribed by The New York Times.
 
Mr. Reid
There are basically two groups of people who can't be sued: foreign diplomats and H.M.O.'s. That isn't the way it should be. . . . 
 An H.M.O. . . . if they've been involved directly in dictating, denying or delaying care for a patient, it can use a loophole in what we call Erisa, the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, to avoid any responsibility for the consequences of its actions. The American people simply do not support that.
Erisa was designed to protect employees when they lose pension benefits due to fraud, mismanagement and employer bankruptcies, which occurred so often during the '60's. The law now has the effect of allowing an H.M.O. to deny or delay care with no effective remedy for patients. What they're trying to do is strike a provision from our bill which simply insures that H.M.O.'s can be held accountable for their actions, a responsibility owed by every other industry to consumers. . . .
All we wanted to do is make the law apply to H.M.O.'s like everyone else. . . .
 
Mr. Durbin
This is the heart of the debate. This is what the patients' bill of rights is all about. The insurance companies hate the idea of being sued in court like the devil hates holy water. They don't want to be held accountable for their actions. They want to be protected so that they can make the wrong decision when it comes to medical care for American families and never, never be held accountable.
The amendment being offered on the Republican side is an effort to take away from 123 million Americans the right to hold health-insurance companies accountable. That is the bottom line, 123 million Americans will be denied an opportunity to go to court when the health-insurance company makes a decision which costs them their health or their life. Most people are stunned to know that you can't take a health-insurance company to court.
Since 1974, a Federal law has protected health-insurance companies from being sued. And what does that mean? When your doctor wants a certain procedure, a certain medicine, a certain specialist for your good or the good of your family, and that doctor is overruled by a health company, health-insurance company bureaucrat, the doctor is the only one who will be taken to court, not the health-insurance company.
If we pass nothing else in this patients' bill of rights but this section which said that health-insurance companies will be held accountable in court, I would tell you it will be a major victory for America. I trust the judgment of 12 citizens of this country in a jury box to decide the fairness and legality of an issue. . . .
For the last two days Senator Kennedy, Senator Reid and all of my colleagues have brought stories to the floor, chilling, heart-breaking stories. Here's one: Florence Corcoran. Let me quote Florence Corcoran. "They let a clerk thousands of miles away make a life-threatening decision about my life and my baby's life without even seeing me and overruled five of my doctors. They don't get held accountable, and that's what appalls me. I relive that all the time. Insurance companies don't answer to nobody," Florence Corcoran says. . . .
Well if you're listening to this debate you think, well surely there must be a long roster of companies in America that receive the same kind of immunity from liability, that can't be brought to court. No. This is it, folks. This is the only sector of the American economy, maybe the only sector in America that is going to be allowed to be held above the law. The Republican majority and the health-insurance industry is determined to protect their immunity from a lawsuit so that Florence Corcoran whose life and the life of her baby was threatened by a decision by a health-insurance company cannot even take that health-insurance company to court. . . .
The state of Texas passed a patients' bill of rights. Said you could take the health-insurance company in court for certain insured people in Texas. Well you would think from the arguments from the Republican side that the sky fell on Texas two years ago. It didn't happen. You know how many lawsuits have been filed since this law was enacted? A law which Governor Bush vetoed and the legislature overrode his veto on? Three lawsuits. Three lawsuits in two years. Does that sound like we're flooding the courts? But I'll tell you something, in that state for those who are protected by that law, I'll bet you there's been a change in the way that they do business.
 
Mr. Gorton
Mr. President, nothing could more dramatically illustrate the difference in general attitudes and attitudes toward health care between the Senator from Massachusetts and the members on this side than his statement that his bill was preferable to ours because it would only cost the American people $7 billion while ours would cost the American people $13 billion.
In fact, of course, overwhelmingly, the costs of his bill will be evidenced in higher taxes on the American people. His so-called costs of our bill are in fact the reduction of taxes on the American people so that they can use their own money to make more of their own health-care costs. But to the Senator from Massachusetts, it's the same thing. More taxes or less taxes. We do not think that that is the same thing by any stretch of the imagination. In addition, of course, he ignores entirely as costs the costs imposed on the American people by paying higher health-insurance premiums. Those, presumably, are irrelevant.
But the subject before us primarily is lawsuits. There is widespread agreement, even in this body and across the United States, that the medical malpractice system is simply broken; that it comes too late, that it costs so much, that less than half of the dollars that it costs ever get to victims and the rest are consumed by lawyers and by the administration of the system itself. The problem is, of course, we have never come up with a majority for a way in which to fix that medical malpractice system. But the proposition that it is broken is very, very widely held.
It is into that broken system that the Democrats' plan pours another element of our health-care system and says, oh, the system may be broken but the only solution is to make it worse, is to make it more widespread, pouring good wine into a broken bottle. With what impact? Better health care? No. We know that the medical malpractice system doesn't create more and better health care. More lawsuits? Clearly, yes. One aspect of that broken system, of course, is that the cost gets not into providing better health care for the people of the country but into the system itself. But the patients, ultimately, the people who buy insurance, the people who consume health care, pay the entire bill, including all of the bills for the lawyers. What impact? Higher costs for everyone who is insured. And therefore fewer insured.
 
Mr. Santorum
A lot has been said about you can't sue your H.M.O. Here are three Federal Circuit Court cases and 12 Federal District Court cases who said that Erisa does not pre-empt state law when you want to sue your H.M.O. for malpractice. . . .
So the issue is not whether you can sue your H.M.O. That's not why we're so adamantly against the provision in the Kennedy bill. It is not to be able to sue your H.M.O. I don't have any problem with you being able to sue your H.M.O. What I do have a problem with is what this bill does is allow you to sue your employer . . . for a decision made by an H.M.O., by an insurance company. What will that mean? . . .
I've talked to dozens, dozens of employers who said if you are going to open up the books of my corporation, and I make widgets, or I make steel, or I make desks, or I make pencils, and you're going to open up my books for my employees to sue me for a decision my insurance company that I hired made, I can't afford, I'm not in the business of health care. I'm not managing these health-care decisions. I hired someone to do that, but I'm going to get sued for their decision.
Sorry, as much as I'd love to provide group health insurance to you, I can't allow our corporation, our effort to be jeopardized by a decision that someone outside of what I do made. I can't let it happen. . . .
Who would be the first person, once these employers drop their insurance as a result of this bill, who would be the first person to run to the Senate floor and say these nasty employers, look at them they're dropping their insurance. We need the Government to take over the health-care system. Yes, the Senator from Massachusetts would be the first person here on the Senate floor calling for a Government health-care system.

HEADLINE: Town Hushed in '95 Crackdown Sees No Reason to Join Iran Riots

BYLINE: By ELAINE SCIOLINO 

DATELINE: ISLAMSHAHR, Iran, July 15

 BODY:
For the young men on the streets of this dusty, crowded, unexceptional town south of Teheran, the nationwide unrest of the last week is little more than a remote spectacle on the nightly news.
Unlike the students at Teheran University whose demonstrations a week ago set off violent riots, these young men seem ill-informed about the closing of a newspaper and a harsh new press law. 
 Unlike the pro-Government marchers who took to the streets to praise the purity of the Islamic system and rail against the United States at rallies throughout Iran on Wednesday, these men stayed home.
In their own way, these men are just as disaffected from the conservative Islamic religious Government that runs their country as the students in Teheran. They share the same desires for personal freedoms. It is just that, here, priorities are different. The men of Islamshahr want jobs.
At an open area with a long line of public telephones, dozens of young men compete to sell telephone cards for tiny profits as they complain about their lives.
"Look at all of us," said one young man in his 20's, pointing to his friends. "We're all jobless. We have nothing to do. We try to do a little bit of business here and there and they arrest us as hooligans. That's why there are so many drug addicts here. It's the despair," said the man, who did not want his name used.
Asked his opinion of the events of the last week, he paused. "Don't say anything!" one of his friends warned. "Don't say anything!"
"It's too dangerous," another said. "There are informants in our midst."
There may be another reason for the reluctance to discuss the demonstrations and the crackdown of the last week -- and to be identified in print. The residents of Islamshahr have seen it all before: in 1995, they had their own violent confrontation with authority.
Once a small village that was a center for nearby cattle, sheep and crop farmers, Islamshahr's population soared to 250,000 as peasants fled the countryside in search of work in Teheran.
In April 1995, gasoline prices soared and bus fares doubled. Early one morning, workers from a nearby shantytown en route to Teheran revolted. They marched to the bigger town of Islamshahr, picking up jobless supporters, smashing storefront windows, and setting fire to banks, gas stations and government buildings along the way.
Unlike the latest riots, in which security forces and their vigilante surrogates used tear gas and riot sticks to quell the crowds, the 1995 violence turned deadly when policemen in Islamshahr opened fire on the swelling crowds. Several people were killed. By nightfall, the riots were over.
The next day, thousands of demonstrators were bused into town to march in praise of the Government. The families of the dead had to compensate the police for the spent bullets. Public mourning was prohibited. An official death toll was never made public. The revolt of Islamshahr was over. In some ways, it was a small-scale dress rehearsal for the recent unrest.
"In the beginning, a lot of people were happy with the demonstrations in Teheran," said one 23-year-old unemployed driver and father of three. "But they went nowhere. They couldn't. The same thing already happened here. There was a riot. There was a crackdown. People got killed. Now people keep quiet. Life is miserable. The only freedom I have is to come to the park with my wife."
Islamshahr is a town in transition. After the 1995 revolt, the central government in Teheran poured millions of dollars into the town in large part to stanch dissent. Concrete shacks were replaced by apartment blocks featuring electricity and running water. Murals of flowers and landscapes were painted on walls.
Building codes that were abandoned after the revolution to provide inexpensive housing for the poor were strictly enforced. Acres of cattle farms were razed to make way for flower-filled parks and to eliminate the powerful smell of cattle dung so close to town. The vast migration of villagers that had swelled the town's population for two decades was abruptly ended.
Islamshahr now boasts new roads, new monuments, a conference hall, a cultural center, an amusement park, a university for 500 students and an air-conditioned movie theater.
At the glittery Fajr movie theater, dedicated by President Mohammad Khatami last year, schoolchildren and teen-agers on their summer vacations sipped soft drinks as they watched Iran's hottest film, "Two Women," by the feminist filmmaker Tahmineh Milani. There is a discount for everyone, the theater manager says, because Islamshahr is "a deprived area."
The film contrasts the life of a successful career woman with her troubled college friend, who must deal with a cruel father, a deranged stalker who is in love with her and a loveless marriage.
At the end of the film, the stalker stabs the husband to death. Suddenly, the wife can make her own decisions. Even though she feels like "a free bird with no wings to fly," she talks about starting over. "I have to go to computer class," she says. "I have to learn to drive."
The audience claps and cheers.
But the construction of a movie theater and other developments have not solved the town's unemployment problem. The construction companies in town prefer to hire Afghan refugees, who work long hours, receive no benefits, earn little pay and make no complaints. At a makeshift bus station leading to Teheran, hundreds of young workers sit and wait for day jobs that often do not come.
At the municipality headquarters, which is undergoing extensive renovation, Buike Moussavi, Islamshahr's Governor, insists that unemployment is not a problem. "We have so many factories and workshops in Islamshahr," he said. "We have workers, bakers, university professors. The land is fertile here. We are growing everything: barley, wheat, corn, vegetables."
Mr. Moussavi said he was distressed that the town has not shaken its reputation for unrest. "When I say Islamshahr, people always think that our protests are very high," he said. "But we have the highest participation of any municipality in Friday prayers every week. People shouldn't be judged by their history. The crisis of four years ago was sparked by something superficial. It's not that the people are carrying a grudge in their hearts."
Mr. Moussavi said that the municipality did not organize its own march in support of the Government on Wednesday and that those who wanted to march made the one-hour drive to Teheran. "If we had had a rally yesterday, it would have been the biggest," he said.
Mr. Moussavi does not say much about the town's youth.
It is no secret that 65 percent of Iran's population is under the age of 25 and Iran's clerical leaders fear that they are losing -- or have already lost -- the generation that has come of age since the the revolution. Many of them have no particular love or hatred for the late Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlevi or even for Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, the cleric who led the revolution.
Universities are so crowded that only 1 in 10 applicants gets in. With jobs scarce, young people must defer marriage because they cannot afford a proper wedding and a place to live. Despite episodic easing of some restrictions, socializing with members of the opposite sex, holding hands in public, listening to certain kinds of music, watching foreign television and of course, drinking alcohol, are forbidden. The official number of drug addicts in Iran is almost two million, although unofficial figures are much higher, particularly among the young.
On one street corner in Islamshahr, a soldier in civilian clothes, a musician in jeans and a slicked-back puffy hairdo and a paramilitary Islamic volunteer turned drug addict offered a chorus of complaint.
"I just exist," said the musician. "I make enough to get food and shelter. I can't play my music except secretly. How could I ever get enough money to get married? You'll always find me here, on this corner. I wouldn't dare go to the park over there because everyone is addicted. They're all shooting heroin. As for politics, I'm like a turtle who keeps my head inside my shell."
Said the soldier: "They were students in Teheran, university students who started these things. They know more than we do."
Then it was the turn of the Islamic volunteer with the sallow complexion and yellow in his eyes. "Can I talk?" he said. "I fought 40 months in the war against Iraq. When I came back the regime abandoned me. Let me tell you who goes to the rallies like the one yesterday. I know because I used to be in them. They are a group who gets paid for going. The youth are becoming drug addicts. We have no freedom, no jobs, nowhere to go and have fun. So we are all addicts. We are all addicts."
"I would hang myself if I weren't so afraid," said the musician.
"But suicide is against Islam," said the soldier. "And we believe in God."

HEADLINE: The China Cloud: Is a Bomb Being Waved at Taiwan?

BYLINE: By SETH FAISON 

DATELINE: BEIJING, July 15

 BODY:
Buried in a tiresome-looking 36-page Government report lay what appeared to be a minor scientific detail, almost invisible because it was mentioned so casually, in a passing reference three sentences long.
But it was not minor at all. China has designed a neutron bomb, the report said, as well as miniature nuclear weapons. 
 It was the timing, not the content, of the disclosure that made it so significant. Scientists have known for years that China had the ability to make a neutron bomb, having detected multiple tests over the last 11 years. But today was the first time that China has publicly asserted owning such technology.
Why now?
The target of this news was apparently Taiwan. Coming just days after Taiwan had said that it was dropping its adherence to its longstanding principle that it and the Chinese mainland are separately governed parts of the same country, the announcement was timed to send a message across the Taiwan Strait -- we've got the stuff, so watch out.
Beijing has never renounced its right to use military force to recover the island, where Chiang Kai-shek's Nationalist troops took refuge after the Communists defeated them in 1949. Today, state-run media reiterated the Government's threat to block Taiwan independence.
The news on the bomb was obscured in a report intended to rebut the Cox Committee report, a Congressional study released in May that accused China of having stolen from the United States information on the designs for the neutron bomb, as well as for the W-88, the most advanced miniaturized warhead.
The Chinese rebuttal denies that China stole any secret nuclear technology from the United States and accuses the Cox report of being politically motivated, full of distortions and painted with a layer of racism directed at the Chinese people and at Chinese-Americans.
The principal suspect in the espionage allegation is Wen Ho Lee, a Taiwan-born American who was discharged from his job at Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico over security breaches but has yet to be charged with a crime.
China's assertions, similar to earlier denials of charges in the Cox report, were most curious for their timing, inexplicably being made a full two months after the Cox report.
The question of the week here is how Beijing will ultimately respond to Taiwan's shifting stance toward the mainland. The senior official who delivered the rebuttal today, Zhao Qizheng, replied when asked afterward that he could not say whether China would take military action.
Paradoxically, however, the announcement may signal China's decision to keep to a relatively restrained response to developments in Taiwan. Although any mention of a neutron bomb sounds intimidating, because it is designed to kill people with intense radiation that leaves buildings undisturbed, the delivery of the news was notably lacking in the rancor and fist-pounding of which Beijing is capable.
"Beijing learned from the last time, in 1996," said a former Clinton Administration official who is visiting here. "They know it's counterproductive to launch missiles."
The former official was referring to China's aggressive stance toward Taiwan three years ago, when Beijing was infuriated by political maneuvering by President Lee Teng-hui of Taiwan that had led to his 1995 visit to the United States, the first by a Taiwan President since Washington dropped diplomatic recognition two decades ago. Although Mr. Lee maintained his Nationalist Party's position that it sought eventual reunification with the mainland, Beijing saw his actions as attempts to raise the island's international profile and nudge it toward independence.
In March 1996, China launched missiles into the ocean near Taiwan to try to intimidate voters just before the presidential election. Instead, Mr. Lee scored a decisive victory.
This week, Mr. Lee made another move that risked angering Beijing, dropping the "one China" formulation that has helped avert war with China for decades by sidestepping the issue of sovereignty and saying the relationship between Taiwan and the mainland would more accurately be described as "state to state."
China's news media responded with tough warnings and a typical dose of vitriol in the Communist Party publication People's Daily. But no senior leader has emerged to speak publicly on the issue. Tonight, the evening news on state television calmly reported on a trip to Mongolia by President Jiang Zemin and on a meeting held by Prime Minister Zhu Rongji on the economy, without highlighting the neutron bomb.
China is thought to have first tested a neutron bomb in 1988, and continued to do so on numerous occasions. But until today it has never publicly discussed that technology.
The rebuttal, "Facts Speak Louder Than Words and Lies Will Collapse on Themselves," asserts that China began work on a neutron bomb in the 1970's, when the United States and the Soviet Union intensified their arms race.
"China had no choice but to continue to carry out research and development of nuclear weapons technology and improve its nuclear weapons systems, mastering in succession the neutron bomb design technology and the nuclear weapon miniaturization technology," the report said.
It denied that China stole the technology involved in those two designs and argued that many design details of the nuclear weapons cited in the Cox report were available in unclassified documents and on the Internet. It also rejects allegations in the Cox report that China had stolen American technology on launching satellites.
Although Chinese leaders act offended and exasperated by the espionage allegations, they are involved in many separate struggles with the United States, all at the same time.
This week, American officials are here to negotiate the issue of compensating China for damages that it suffered in the NATO bombing of the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade in May. Chinese leaders still say they find it hard to believe Washington's insistence that the bombing was accidental. Washington insists that a combination of unlikely errors and outdated maps caused the bombing. .
Only after the compensation issue is settled will China and the United States be able to proceed on resuming negotiations on obtaining membership for China in the World Trade Organization, a goal that China's leaders still seem determined to achieve. Yet the timing is tricky, as well as the substance of the talks.
Complicating both sets of negotiations are suspicions some Chinese leaders have toward the United States role in Taiwan's latest shift from the "one China" policy. Chinese scholars have argued that the United States, eager to contain a fast-emerging China, is encouraging Taiwan toward independence, ruining China's goal of reunification.

HEADLINE: Syrian Peace His Aim, Barak Tells Clinton

BYLINE: By JOHN M. BRODER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 15

 BODY:
Prime Minister Ehud Barak told President Clinton today that Israel would embark on a "serious effort" in the next several weeks to restart negotiations with Syria, which is still formally at war with Israel.
In a private meeting with the President at the White House that lasted two and a half hours, Mr. Barak laid down several conditions that he would demand as the price of peace with Syria, according to a senior Israeli official who spoke with Mr. Barak after the session. 
 The Prime Minister told Mr. Clinton that Israel was prepared for "painful compromises and difficult decisions" to reach agreement with Syria, if it offers concessions in turn, the official said. Israel is willing to partly pull its troops back from the Golan Heights on the Israel-Syria border if the two countries can reach agreement on the status of Lebanon, terrorism, borders, water rights and normalization of diplomatic relations.
Mr. Barak told Mr. Clinton that Israel would never agree to return to the borders that existed before the 1967 war, the official said.
Today's meeting was the first of a series of discussions the new Israeli Prime Minister will have with the President and other top American officials over the next five days. The Washington talks come barely a week after he was sworn in as Prime Minister and are intended to dramatize his commitment to rapid progress toward political reconciliation.
Mr. Barak also told the President that he would continue the withdrawal of Israeli forces from the West Bank under terms of a deal reached with Palestinians at the Wye Plantation in Maryland late last year, but that "most" Israeli settlers would remain in the communities they have established there.
"We are at the moment of truth," Mr. Barak told Mr. Clinton, according to the Israeli official. "Our generation must find a way to solve this conflict. We will leave no stone unturned to reach peace agreements that will enhance the security of Israel."
After the meeting with Mr. Clinton, Mr. Barak met briefly with Vice President Al Gore and then Mr. Clinton and Hillary Rodham Clinton and Mr. Barak and his wife, Nava, flew by helicopter to Camp David to dine privately and spend the night.
Speaking to reporters in the Rose Garden in an appearance with Mr. Clinton before their meeting, Mr. Barak said he planned a vigorous effort to resume discussions with all of Israel's neighbors and with the Palestinians. He asked for the President's support, but at the same time expressed a desire for the United States to play a less prominent role in negotiations and in enforcing any ultimate agreements.
Mr. Clinton publicly agreed that the United States had become overly intrusive in the Middle East dialogue in the last several years. He said Washington should serve merely as a "facilitator" of talks involving Israel, its Arab neighbors and the Palestinians, not as an active participant.
"We should not be in a patronizing role; we should be in a supportive role," Mr. Clinton said in his public appearance with the Prime Minister. It was the first time Mr. Clinton had responded to Mr. Barak's complaint this week that the United States had been too deeply enmeshed in Middle East negotiations.
The President said the United States had intervened only when it appeared that progress toward peace had halted.
"We took a more active role, in effect as a mediator, when the bonds of trust and the lines of communication had become so frayed that we were in danger of losing the peace process," Mr. Clinton said. "And I did not want that to happen."
He said it was far preferable for the parties to talk directly to one another without American intercession, as Mr. Barak said he intended to do.
The Prime Minister said that he did not want the United States to serve as "policeman, judge and arbitrator" of relations between Israel and the Arabs. Mr. Barak seemed to be referring in part to the C.I.A.'s involvement in security issues with the Palestinians, a role that was established at the Wye accords and one that some critics say supplanted the chances of direct contact between the Israelis and the Palestinians on those issues.
Mr. Barak did emphasize today that restarting the Middle East dialogue would require "American leadership and support all along the way."
Mr. Barak said that he would abide by all agreements signed by previous Israeli governments, including the Wye accords. He said he intended to try to reach agreement on "all tracks" of regional peace talks, including a comprehensive accord with Syria.
However, he said he felt as if he had "got the mission of defusing a time bomb" by taking office after a three-year period in which Israel's relations with its neighbors, the Palestinians and the United States were badly strained by the cantankerous posture of the Likud Government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
Mr. Barak, who was sworn in just last week after winning a landslide victory over Mr. Netanyahu in May, has already met with Yasir Arafat, the Palestinian leader, King Abdullah of Jordan and President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt.
He said today that he was prepared to sit down with Hafez al-Assad, the President of Syria, to discuss peace with Syria and an Israeli withdrawal from Lebanon, which Syria essentially controls.
"It takes two to tango," Mr. Barak said. "I am ready, the arena is ready, maybe the dancing instructor is ready. We have to find an opportunity and begin."
Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright is expected to travel to Syria in the next several weeks to sound out officials there on what conditions they will require for normalization of relations with Israel.
President Assad has insisted that Israel withdraw all of its forces from southern Lebanon and return land on the Golan Heights seized during the 1967 war. He also wants a permanent international observer force stationed in the Golan to insure that Israel lives up to its commitments.
Mr. Assad would also like the lifting of economic sanctions the United States imposed because of the American determination that Syria sponsors international terrorism.
Mr. Clinton said he had not meant to signal a shift in American policy toward Palestinian refugees or to prejudge the outcome of so-called final status talks when he said two weeks ago that the refugees should be able to settle "wherever they want to live."
The remark touched off a wave of criticism in Israel, where the "right of return" of hundreds of thousands of Palestinians scattered around the Middle East to territory now occupied by Israel is one of the most emotional issues still to be resolved with Palestinian leaders.
The refugee issue is one to be negotiated in the permanent status talks between Israel and the Palestinians, Mr. Clinton said.
"The United States, as a sponsor of the peace process, has asked the parties to do nothing to prejudge the final status issues," the President said. "We certainly should be doing nothing to prejudge the final status issues."
Mr. Clinton gave a similar answer in response to a question arising from Mrs. Clinton's statement last week that Jerusalem is the capital of Israel and that the United States should move its embassy to Jerusalem from Tel Aviv.
Her statement is at odds with Administration policy, which is that the status of Jerusalem has yet to be decided and that the United States Embassy will remain in Tel Aviv until it is.
For his part, Mr. Barak said he would like embassies from all nations to be in Jerusalem, which both Israel and the Palestinians claim as their historic capitals.

HEADLINE: Lawmakers Vote to Increase Their Pay and President's

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 15

 BODY:
The House voted overwhelmingly today to give members of Congress a $4,600 pay raise in January and to double the next President's salary to $400,000.
Lawmakers voted 276 to 147 to increase their own pay, rolling up nearly 2-to-1 margins among Republicans and Democrats alike. They then voted 334 to 82 to reject an effort by conservatives to prevent the Presidential pay increase. 
 The vote on legislators' salaries underlined the favorable political climate for the second Congressional raise in 18 months. The last raise before that was in 1993.
Not only do polls show Congress rated favorably by more than half the public, but it is also enjoying a time of economic plenty and growing budget surpluses. While in past years the Congressional pay question has often provoked heated battles, the issue came and went today with scarcely a mention and as an obscure parliamentary vote.
The scant debate opened with Representative Jim Kolbe, Republican of Arizona, saying he hoped lawmakers would support a procedural motion -- on a Treasury Department spending bill -- that in effect allowed the Congressional raise. It ended moments later when two Kentucky Representatives, Ken Lucas, a Democrat, and Ernie Fletcher, a Republican, said they would oppose it.
"It looked like there was so much bipartisan support for the COLA, I didn't think anybody wanted to make it a major, controversial issue," Mr. Fletcher said in an interview later. COLA is shorthand for cost-of-living adjustment, the official name for the raise.
Even so, the potential volatility of the issue was reflected by the votes of the House's most vulnerable blocks of members. The 42 freshmen voted 26 to 15 against the raise, and one did not vote. And the 44 lawmakers elected by margins of 10 percent or less last November voted "no" by 30 to 13, and one did not vote.
Most members of Congress earn $136,700 annually but leaders get more, with Speaker J. Dennis Hastert, Republican of Illinois, earning $175,400. The increase will be 3.4 percent -- by law rounded to the nearest $100 -- pushing most lawmakers to $141,300 and Mr. Hastert to $181,400.
Under a 1989 law, lawmakers get an annual raise automatically unless they vote to deny it, a mechanism that has at times let them avoid taking politically risky votes. A formula in the law links the increase to the one Federal workers will receive, which President Clinton has proposed to be 4.4 percent.
The Senate approved the Treasury measure on July 1 without language preventing the increase, and with no mention of it during debate. It is all but certain that the compromise version of the bill will be silent on the issue, which means the increase will take effect.

HEADLINE: BASEBALL;
Behind Umpires' Bold Move Is the Belief That Baseball's Risk Is Bigger

BYLINE: By MURRAY CHASS 

 BODY:
They saw a fight coming and decided that they, and not their employers, would pick the time and place to start it. Now baseball's major league umpires, whose letters of resignation, effective Sept. 2, were sent by fax to the league offices yesterday, will wait to learn if they have taken too great a risk.
"I live in Orlando," Rocky Roe, an American League umpire, said yesterday in St. Petersburg, Fla., before the Mets-Devil Rays game. "There's always the possibility I could be at Disney World looking for a job. Sure, there's an inherent risk." 
 Major League Baseball officials were silent yesterday on the umpires' unexpected action, saying only that they were reviewing the situation. But some are known to welcome the resignations, because they feel they would be able to start over with new umpires and regain the control they feel they have lost.
Like Roe, Richie Phillips, head of the umpires union, acknowledged the risk in the umpires' action. But, he said, if baseball hired replacement umpires, it would be taking a much bigger risk.
"They risk having 25 years of inferior umpiring ahead of them," Phillips said in a telephone interview, "in a game in which they will be presenting a very, very watered down product. That's a real risk."
The labor agreement between the umpires and the National and American Leagues expires Dec. 31. Negotiations for a new deal were going to be confrontational because the two sides have been headed for a fight for more than a year, and the tension has been especially high since the beginning of this year. The fight is just starting earlier than expected.
The umpires, who are barred by the labor contract from striking, decided to adopt the resignation strategy because they will receive $15.5 million in termination pay. The severance ranges from $150,000 for a 10-year umpire to $400,000 for one who has 20 or more years in the majors.
About a dozen and a half umpires out of the 66-member union do not qualify for severance, but those who do have agreed to share a percentage of their termination pay with the younger umpires. Phillips said resignation letters of 63 umpires were faxed yesterday.
The umpires acted before they could be acted upon. They believed management planned to try to induce lower-rated umpires to leave, telling them they could resign and receive severance or be fired and get nothing. Rather than have severance used as a weapon against them, the umpires opted to have it work for them.
In that way, the fight is economic. But it is also about respect. "A lot of times we feel that we're not appreciated," said Roe, a 20-year veteran.
The umpires chose a resignation date seven weeks away, figuring there would be time for the two sides to achieve an agreement that would prompt them to rescind their resignations. "Hopefully," Roe said, "the parties will be able to get together and negotiate in good faith and get a deal done."
The players pursued a similar strategy in 1994, figuring the owners would rush to an agreement to salvage the post-season. But the owners, for the first time, held firm, then congratulated themselves on their ability to do that as the World Series was canceled.
In previous work stoppages involving umpires, the leagues hired replacements, but they turned out to be inadequate and prompted players and fans alike to clamor for the return of the regular umpires. Fans at various parks booed umpires when they walked onto the field last night, but Phillips recalled different scenes.
"What Bud Selig and his errand boys don't understand," the Philadelphia lawyer said, referring to the commissioner, "is that in 1979, when the umpires returned May 19, they received standing ovations at every park in America. In 1984, in San Diego, when they returned for the fifth game of the Padres-Cubs series, the umpires got a standing ovation. After the 1995 lockout, upon their return, they received standing ovations."
But a different dynamic could come into play this time. While the umpires are gambling that the major leagues cannot do without them, management could decide to let them resign, then go out and hire permanent replacements. By hiring umpires on a permanent basis, they may be able to recruit more capable people than they have been able to lure for previous, temporary work stoppages.
Even some of the major league umpires could change their minds if they are faced with permanent loss of their jobs, which, including a $25,000 year-end bonus, pay from $95,000 to $262,500.
And not all of the union umpires are enamored of Phillips's leadership. Last spring about a dozen umpires approached Ron Shapiro, a noted player agent, and asked if he would be interested in representing the umpires. They told him they were concerned with Phillips's confrontational stance. But nothing developed, and an overwhelming majority of umpires continued to support Phillips, voting him a new five-year contract.
 The possibility of the commissioner's office hiring an entirely new crew of umpires contains an unusual element. New umpires would be represented by the same bargaining unit, the Major League Umpires Association. The old members of the union would go away, but not the union. The head of the union, of course, is Phillips, and he would continue under his five-year contract.
Asked yesterday what he thought would happen next, Phillips said, "I expect that in keeping with their attitude of smugness and typical management arrogance, they will start recruiting their amateur umpire force in order to intimidate the umpires."
One large group of umpires may not be available. With 220 of the 228 minor league umpires voting for it and the other 8 abstaining, a new union of minor league umpires has been formed. It has yet to be recognized by the minor league group that hires umpires, but the umpires are represented by Phillips and he said they support the major league umpires.
On the other hand, the lure of lucrative major league jobs, if offered, could be difficult to resist.

HEADLINE: Tax Refund Won't Help

 BODY:

To the Editor:
The Republican plan to give taxpayers a refund for the budget surplus (editorial, July 12) would be a grand mistake. The additional consumption would feed inflation and ultimately raise interest rates. That, in turn, would slow corporate investment, constrict construction, hamper the stock market and hurt taxpayers already strapped by credit-card debt and adjustable mortgages.
Using the surplus to pay down the debt, however, would benefit everyone. 
 Interest rates would have to fall, making the country competitive in export markets and supporting corporate investment in new technology and higher productivity. The American consumer would win, with credit costs falling and employment remaining high.

HEADLINE: 2 Exchanges in Retreat From Times Sq.

BYLINE: By CHARLES V. BAGLI 

 BODY:
Nearly a year after Nasdaq and the American Stock Exchange created a stir in New York with grand plans to move to a new 40-story skyscraper near Times Square, the two financial markets have reversed course and now appear ready to stay in lower Manhattan.
The decision amounts to a retreat for Frank G. Zarb, the chairman of the National Association of Securities Dealers, which owns both Nasdaq and the American Stock Exchange. Mr. Zarb had planned to move to Times Square, a telegenic international crossroads, as a step in building a world financial market that would rival the New York Stock Exchange. But Mr. Zarb has since discovered that building a new headquarters in midtown, or even in lower Manhattan, can be expensive. 
 In a letter sent to city officials yesterday, Nasdaq said the two stock markets were now considering the expansion of the existing trading floor at the American Stock Exchange, at 86 Trinity Place, and leasing 290,000 square feet at either 1 Liberty Plaza or 1 World Financial Center for Nasdaq. City officials and real estate executives say they still expect the N.A.S.D. to move to New York from Washington.
At the same time, Nasdaq resurrected a threat to move its operations to Jersey City if it does not get a large package of tax breaks from New York, though real estate executives on both sides of the Hudson River say they doubt that the exchanges would leave Manhattan.
Noting that "the city's goal" was to bring the N.A.S.D. to New York, Randy L. Levine, Deputy Mayor for Economic Development, said: "We always left the exact location up to them. We'll continue to work with them to try and find a suitable home."
Last November, Nasdaq signed an agreement with the state and the city to build a new headquarters for the exchanges in a skyscraper to be built at 42d Street and the Avenue of the Americas, or a similar site, with a $200 million package of tax breaks and cash. Mr. Levine said yesterday that it was unlikely that Nasdaq would get anywhere near that amount now.
"The $200 million deal was for a new building," he said. "We usually grant a lower level of incentives when you're only leasing space."
Despite signing the agreement with New York on Nov. 3, Michael Jones, chief administrative officer for the N.A.S.D., said the association had made it clear to everyone involved that the exchanges were still examining the financial feasibility of building and occupying a new headquarters. Because it has several leases that are expiring, he said the association could not wait five years for a new building to be constructed.
"We're looking at all our options," said Mr. Jones, who is leading the search in New York. "New Jersey isn't out of the mix either. Right now, we have some immediate needs that a new building cannot meet."
But Mr. Zarb and Nasdaq have suffered many problems pursuing its plans. Mr. Zarb wanted a separate identity in a glamorous location that would get him out from under the shadow of the larger New York Stock Exchange and its chairman, Richard A. Grasso. A year ago, Mr. Zarb signed a deal to build a marketing center and the largest video billboard in Times Square at a new skyscraper, 4 Times Square. He also opened negotiations with the developer Douglas Durst and the city for a new headquarters in a proposed office tower next door.
But merger talks with the Philadelphia Exchange collapsed, and a Times Square tower looked expensive. In March, the city encouraged Nasdaq to consider moving into a subsidized trading complex in lower Manhattan that Mr. Grasso was planning for the New York Stock Exchange, an option that Mr. Zarb seemed unwilling to consider. Nasdaq briefly considered an offer from Brookfield Financial Properties, a major commercial landlord, to build a new tower at the World Financial Center.
"It shows that Zarb has a lot to learn from Dick Grasso," said Mitchell Moss, director of New York University's Urban Research Center. "Not everybody is ready for prime time."
Mr. Moss added that it had become clear over the last year that modern financial markets would be more about computers and phone lines than trading floors. "The new markets are built on computers, not real estate," Mr. Moss said.

Pepon Osorio
'Transboricua'
Youngworld Children's Department Store
1915 Third Avenue, at 106th Street
East Harlem
Through July 25
A few years ago, Pepon Osorio's installation "Badge of Honor" made its debut in a storefront in a working class neighborhood in Newark. The piece, based on a video dialogue between a Latino boy and his imprisoned father, later appeared at Ronald Feldman Gallery in SoHo and elsewhere. But the resonance it generated in its original setting was extraordinary. 
 Work by Mr. Osorio, who recently won a MacArthur grant and who participated in the 1993 Whitney biennial, often travels this route from the real world to the art world. "Transboricua" is the latest example of that process.
Created for a public library in Providence, R.I., and now installed in Youngworld Children's Department Store in East Harlem, the piece looks more streamlined than some of Mr. Osorio's previous installations -- the amazing "Scene of the Crime (Whose Crime?)" now installed at the Bronx Museum of the Arts is an example -- but it is loaded with eye-catching symbolic detail.
It starts with a huge cage of cyclone fencing set amid the store's racks of bright "Hot Summer Fun" clothes. A mannequinlike figure is locked inside: a man wearing a dark suit, a broad-brimmed hat, a small backpack and boxing gloves, his face entirely swathed in patterned cloth. He stands on pink clay patio tiles surrounded by green plastic ground cover. A microphone is in front of him, and a stuffed peacock is nearby.
Every aspect of the piece is coded with meaning. The cage suggests both confinement and protection; the backpack is a sign of someone on the move. The man's glitter-covered hat carries the Puerto Rican national emblem, his face is covered by a Mexican flag and his boxing gloves are emblazoned with the official insignia of the Dominican Republic. He looks imposing and combative, but the music he appears to sing into the microphone (it is actually piped in from elsewhere) is a 1940's Puerto Rican lament about a man returning empty-handed from a long and arduous journey.
The dozens of cartoon eyes sewn to the man's suit echo the patterns on the tail of the peacock, and the motif is picked up in dozens of photographic pins, each carrying the portrait of a child. Before the pictures were taken, Mr. Osorio had asked the children to imagine what they might look like 50 years in the future, and they faced the camera with eyes closed, as if they were lost in thought. A single pair of eyes appears on a little video implanted in the man's backpack. Their pupils take the form of a world globe.
Installed under the direction of the curator Julia P. Herzberg, "Transboricua" is about many things. The title implies the idea of transition or transformation, one directly pertinent to the East Harlem setting: the barrio, once largely Puerto Rican, is now home to other Latino populations, a mix that has produced territorial tensions.
As Ms. Herzberg points out in a flyer, the piece also addresses a broader picture. Despite a history of poverty, America's Hispanic population does its share to keep a double-edged consumerist economy afloat. (Youngworld is evidence of that.) But that economy is reducing ethnic diversity to a global culture in which everyone is, to some degree, spiritually homeless.
Mr. Osorio manages to imbed all of this into his installation without making a big deal of any of it, and, most important, without sacrificing visual flair. And "Transboricua" will make its leap out of the community into the art world next fall. It will be installed in the Museo del Barrio on Fifth Avenue at 104th Street in September, where it will take on another, different, though surely no less dynamic life. HOLLAND COTTER

HEADLINE: ART GUIDE

 BODY:
Here is a selective listing by critics of The Times of new or noteworthy art, design and photography exhibitions at New York City museums and art galleries this weekend. Addresses, unless otherwise noted, are in Manhattan. Most galleries are closed on Sundays and Mondays, but hours vary and should be checked by telephone. Gallery admission is free.
* denotes a highly recommended show. 

Museums
 
"THE AMERICAN CENTURY: ART AND CULTURE, 1900-1950," Whitney Museum of American Art, 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (212) 570-3676 (through Aug. 22). This is the first half of a marathon end-of-an-era survey. (Part 2, covering 1950-2000, opens on Sept. 26.) It flows chronologically through four floors of the museum's galleries, resulting in a show of substantial if circumscribed pleasures. Most of the 600 paintings, drawings and sculptures are familiar icons from a canonical art history, one in need of shaking up. But if what is here is short on fresh insights, there are wonderful things to look at. And by the time you've worked your way from Gilded Age society portraits on the top floor to Jackson Pollock below, you've had a genuine time-travel experience: exhausting, diverting, sometimes moving, even pride-inspiring. Hours: Tuesdays, Wednesdays, Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays, 11 A.M. to 6 P.M.; Thursdays, 1 to 8 P.M. Admission: $12.50; $10.50, students and the elderly (Holland Cotter).
 
* "AMERICAN FOLK ART IN THE METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART," Fifth Avenue at 82d Street, (212) 879-5500 (through Sept. 5). One of the museum's less visible collections, this group of folk art portraits, views, genre scenes, marine paintings, religious works and so on has been assembled for its first-ever overall showing, and high time. The best are the portraits, which include a masterpiece or two by the great Ammi Phillips, along with the work of Joshua Johnston, Erastus Salisbury Field, Rufus Hathaway and other greats. A very appealing section of watercolors and drawings includes mourning pictures, a Victorian convention in which relatives of the dead are shown weeping by tombstones; tributes to heroes like George Washington and General Lafayette, calligraphic endeavors and a number of lively renditions of family groups and trees. Not to be missed are some wonderful New York views, like William H. Schenck's "Third Avenue Railroad Depot" (1859-1860), a handsome red brick building that served as a trolley turnaround and station between 65th and 66th Streets. Hours: Tuesdays through Thursdays and Sundays, 9:30 A.M. to 5:15 P.M.; Fridays and Saturdays, to 9 P.M. Admission: $8; $4, children and the elderly (Grace Glueck).
 
"BEYOND THE SQUARE: COLOR AND DESIGN IN AMISH QUILTS," Museum of American Folk Art, 2 Lincoln Square, (212) 595-9533 (through Nov. 7). A reticent but festive show of 20 splendid quilts made by members of a separatist religious sect from the late 1880's well into the 20th century. Most of the designs are based on 19th-century American prototypes, though the forms are often dramatically pared down and the Amish palette is distinctive, with wide stretches of rich colors: pink, pumpkin, snappy blue, wine-red. Because Amish law discourages ornament as an end in itself, the subtlest decorative flourishes in quilts are often found in stitch work, which is alive with wreaths, flowers and vines that reveal themselves only on close examination. The result throughout is work of both intense optical pleasure and a principled view of the world. Hours: Tuesdays through Sundays, 11:30 A.M. to 7:30 P.M. Free (Cotter).
 
"FAME AFTER PHOTOGRAPHY," Museum of Modern Art, 11 West 53d Street, (212) 708-9400 (through Oct. 5). Not the usual Modern exhibition, this breezily entertaining summer extravaganza includes hundreds of publicity stills, movie trailers, supermarket glossies and television excerpts that chart a trajectory from the world of Queen Victoria to that of Kato Kaelin. The subject is celebrity as a phenomenon redefined by photography. You'll leave it wondering whether something that has become so commonplace is still meaningful beyond its value as a marketable commodity. Hours: Saturdays through Tuesdays, and Thursdays, 10:30 A.M. to 5:45 P.M.; Fridays, 10:30 A.M. to 8:15 P.M. Admission: $10; $6.50, students and the elderly (Michael Kimmelman).
 
"CLARA GUTSCHE: THE CONVENT SERIES," Americas Society, 680 Park Avenue, at 68th Street, (212) 249-8950 (through July 25). At once matter of fact and quietly radiant, these 54 photographs taken in 20 Canadian convents include pristine interiors and pictures of nuns, shown in prayer, lined up outside their rooms, reading in the library, playing cards in the community room. They document a life of devotion, selflessness, unwavering daily routines and restrained joy, while also insinuating themselves into the history of portraiture, religious art and contemporary set-up photography (Roberta Smith).
 
* "EL NUEVO MUNDO: THE LANDSCAPE OF LATINO LOS ANGELES," Cooper-Hewitt, National Design Museum, Smithsonian Institution, 2 East 91st Street, (212) 849-8400 (through Sept. 5). For more than two decades, the photographer Camilo Jose Vergara has documented the process of physical change in the poorest neighborhoods in American cities. The story is often one of disintegration, but in the color pictures here he turns his eye on the largely Mexican community in Los Angeles, where transplanted cultural roots are in photogenic flower. Life is hard, but houses, stores and city walls are painted with vivid images of religious icons, consumer goods and yearned-for south-of-the-border vistas. Mr. Vergara's careerlong project is an important one; this show is a vivid installment in his expansive field work. And it takes on an extra resonance at the Cooper-Hewitt, a former Andrew Carnegie mansion. Hours: Tuesdays, 10 A.M. to 9 P.M.; Wednesdays through Saturdays, 10 A.M. to 5 P.M.; Sundays, noon to 5 P.M. Admission: $5; children under 12 and the elderly, $3 (Cotter).
 
"OUR NEW CLOTHES: ACQUISITIONS OF THE 1990'S," Costume Institute of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue at 82d Street, (212) 535 7710 (through Aug. 22). The Costume Institute didn't become a premier repository for things sartorial by sitting on its hands. It went out and shopped, and also accepted numerous gifts from donors. Now it is showing off its finds with its usual well-ordered clarity. The show's five sections include a dazzling display of white dresses, a sampling of male attire and a quick run through the mutations of the 18th-century open robe and petticoat combination, all the way up to Madame Gres. There are also mostly beautiful gowns once worn by celebrities like Lillian Gish, Susan Sarandon, Nancy Reagan, Madonna and Diana, Princess of Wales. Hours and admission: See above (Smith)
 
* "POMO INDIAN BASKET WEAVERS, THEIR BASKETS AND THE ART MARKET," National Museum of the American Indian, 1 Bowling Green, lower Manhattan, (212) 514-3712 (through Aug. 15). Baskets made by the Pomo Indians of northern California around the turn of the century were notable for the strength of their design and artistry, and when white settlers new to the territory discovered them a market began to develop. The baskets, in earth colors of black, tan and deep brown with subtle geometric designs, were often covered or accented with tiny colored feathers, clam shell disks (which once served the Pomo as money), abalone pendants and stones. They ranged in size from feast bowls that could feed a tribal gathering to miniatures so tiny they could be mistaken for seeds. This is a knockout presentation of the work of 47 early 20th-century Pomo basket makers. Organized by the University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archeology and Anthropology, it vividly tells the story of the weavers (mostly women), their patrons and collectors. Hours: Daily, 10 A.M. to 5 P.M.; Thursdays, to 8 P.M. Free (Glueck).
 
* "SURREALISM: TWO PRIVATE EYES," the Nesuhi Ertegun and Daniel Filipacchi Collections, Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500 (through Sept. 12). The Surrealist collections formed by two friends fill the museum from lobby to ceiling. Although it has more than 700 objects, this powerful show is by no means a comprehensive survey but an intense, close-up experience of Surrealism that might be imparted by two obsessed acquisitors taking you on a personal tour of their treasures. Highlights include clusters of paintings by Dali, Victor Brauner, Magritte, Andre Masson and Yves Tanguy; a splendid group of boxes by Joseph Cornell; a brilliant selection of photographs rife with portraits by Man Ray; dozens of beautifully bound books, and remarkable drawings by Hans Bellmer and Masson. The show has notable omissions and a few surprising inclusions, but by and large the menu is gourmet. Hours: Sundays through Wednesdays, 10 A.M. to 6 P.M.; Fridays and Saturdays, 10 A.M. to 8 P.M. Admission: $12; $7 for students and the elderly (Glueck).
 
"THE UNPRIVATE HOUSE," Museum of Modern Art, 11 West 53d Street, (212) 708-9400 (through Oct. 5). Intelligently argued, selected and installed, the Modern's first survey of domestic architecture in 30 years rings in changes both esthetic and social: the fading of Post-modernism as an architectural style, the evolving notions of privacy and family, the pervasive effects of technology, the rise of the home office. These are reflected in 26 houses designed in the last decade by an impressive roster of architects, beginning with Rem Koolhaas, and presented in photographs, plans and models. The furniture from David Schaefer Furniture Company makes the theme of domesticity a tangible and comfortable reality. Although the spare-no-expense atmosphere sometimes gives the show the look of a high-end shelter magazine and it may be a while before video walls are the norm, several of the houses are geared to more modest budgets and needs. Hours and admission: See above (Smith).
 
Galleries: Uptown
 
JAN MATULKA, Richard York, 21 East 65th Street, (212) 772-9155 (through July 30). This exhibition of harbor scenes presents Matulka (1890-1972), one of the lesser-known but more engaging of American Early Modernists, at his most appealing. The paintings offer views of seaside houses, sheds and wharves, rocky shores, cozy, blue bays and chunky, toylike boats robustly painted in a brightly colored, chunky style that looks like a marriage of folk art and Cubism (Johnson).
 
* "STAMPED WITH A NATIONAL CHARACTER: 19TH-CENTURY AMERICAN COLOR PLATE BOOKS," Grolier Club, 47 East 60th Street, (212) 838-6690 (through July 31). Color in books is a commonplace today, but 200 years ago it was a rarity in American volumes and affordable only by upscale readers. With more than 100 examples, this thoroughly absorbing show traces the evolution of the American color plate book from 1800 to the end of the century when machine production ended laborious hand operations. Assembled from the collection of William S. Reese, a New Haven dealer and collector, its objects range from John James Audubon's giant portfolio "The Birds of America" to fashion books and medical texts with gruesome illustrations. Worthy of special note is the earliest color plate book produced in the United States, "The City of Philadelphia, in the State of Pennsylvania, North America, As It Appeared in the Year 1800," a handsome offering that might be called the first American coffee table book (Glueck).
 
Galleries: 57th Street
 
ELLIOTT GREEN, JANE HAMMOND, DAVID TRUE, TREVOR WINKFIELD, Tibor de Nagy, 724 Fifth Avenue, (212) 262-5050 (through July 26). Each of the painters in this well-selected show has developed his or her own idiosyncratic mix of Pop, Surrealism and figurative narrative. They harmonize well together, but Mr. True's big, zany cartoon version of the biblical Expulsion, with its eerie population of rubbery, incandescently hued characters, steals the show (Johnson).
 
JASPER JOHNS, Susan Sheehan, 20 West 57th Street, (212) 489-3331 (through July 31). Familiar Johnsian motifs are here embodied in prints from the 60's, 70's and 80's: the numbers 0 through 9 stenciled one over another; three versions of brushes in a Savarin coffee can; five expansive, hatchwork abstractions; a blotchy, black-and-white double flag; and the autobiographical suite "Four Seasons." Johns's distinctively deft, matter-of-fact touch animates them all (Johnson).
 
"LINEAR IMPULSE," Michael Rosenfeld, 24 West 57th Street, (212) 247-0082 (through Aug. 13). This crowded presentation of variously linear paintings and sculptures includes famous artists like David Smith, Mark Tobey and Lee Krasner. There are works in outmoded Modernist styles, like the Surrealistic Cubist paintings of Jimmy Ernst, but there are things that still look fresh, including richly layered paintings by Alfonso Ossorio and a dense ball of wire and glass by Claire Falkenstein (Johnson).
 
ALICE TRUMBULL MASON, Washburn, 20 West 57th Street, (212) 397-6780 (through July 23). Descended from a prominent Colonial New England family, Mason (1904-1971) studied with Arshile Gorky in the late 1920's. As this selection of works from four decades proves, she remained devoted to abstraction throughout her long, under-recognized career. Her modestly scaled paintings, always rigorously structured, sensuously painted and richly colored, were influenced by Miro early on and later by Mondrian, but they always have their own engaging personality (Johnson).
 
JOHN McLAUGHLIN, Ameringer Howard, 41 East 57th Street, (212) 935-1110 (through July 30). McLaughlin (1898-1976) dealt in Asian antiquities and served as a high-ranking translator during World War II before moving to California and, at age 50, beginning his distinguished career as a painter of austere, Zen-inspired abstractions. This show presents five dry, near-Minimalist rectilinear canvases and a series of lithographs from which Peter Halley might have got the barred windows of his cell paintings (Johnson).
 
JUDITH JOY ROSS, Pace Wildenstein MacGill, 32 East 57th Street, (212) 759-7999 (through Aug. 27). Ms. Ross makes understated, uncommonly sensitive photographic portraits, especially of children. Among her lovely gold-toned 8-by-10-inch works are pictures of a blond, messy-haired urchin slouched at his elementary-school desk, gazing at the camera with a look of heartbreaking ennui, and of a 10- or 11-year-old girl standing by a hazy lake with a Band-Aid on her knee and an ethereal aura (Johnson).
 
"WALKING," Danese, 41 East 57th Street, (212) 223-2227 (through Aug. 27). An unexpected variety of approaches to the theme of walking makes this an intriguing show. Among the 21 works are pictures of Marina Abramovic walking the Great Wall of China, a gouache painting of a maze pattern by Richard Fleischner, a photograph of an attractive woman in a phone booth shot by the pedestrian voyeur Garry Winogrand and Ann Truitt's striped minimalist column painted colors observed while walking outdoors (Johnson).
 
Galleries: SoHo
 
PEDRO BARBEITO, Basilico, 26 Wooster Street, (212) 966-1831 (through July 30). A young Spanish-born painter who lives in Brooklyn presents four absorbing paintings that look like complicated computer-generated diagrams. Mr. Barbeito applies layers of thick paint, following underlying grid patterns. At certain points, small-scale gridded structures made entirely of layered paint project several inches from the surface. There is a nice tension between disembodied rationalism and quirky materialism (Johnson).
 
BARTON LIDICE BENES, Lennon, Weinberg, 560 Broadway, at Spring Street, (212) 941-0012 (through July 30). Mr. Benes produces modern reliquaries: broad, shallow boxes divided into little cubbyholes, each containing a labeled, more or less sacred relic. Among the items displayed in "Celebrity" you'll find a police badge worn by Sean Penn in the movie "Colors" and a wad of Dustin Hoffman's chewing gum. These devotional works are for a Warholian world where the gods have devolved into celebrities (Johnson).
 
ROSS BLECKNER, Betsy Senior, 375 West Broadway, near Spring Street, (212) 941-0960 (through Aug. 27). The 10 new etchings in this show correspond to the large cellular abstract paintings Mr. Bleckner exhibited last fall. Patterns of luminous, blurry lines and glowing dots are Bleckneresque but the prints don't have the magical illusionism of the paintings (Johnson).
 
ALBERT HOFFMAN, Luise Ross, 568 Broadway, at Prince Street, (212) 343-2161 (through July 23). Hoffman (1915-1993), a junkyard proprietor in Absecon, N.J., was passionately devoted to carving wood in his spare time. A number of the works in this show have the sculptural and imaginative presence of the best folk art, including a bigger-than-life bust of a rabbi, an undulating eel that has a Brancusian formal economy and a fanciful representation of Neptune riding a sea turtle (Johnson).
 
CHIP HOOPER, "California Dreamin,' " Edward Carter Gallery, 560 Broadway, at Prince Street, (212) 966-1933 (through Sept. 11). The Big Sur coast of northern California and the Southwest desert are explored in these contemplative black-and-white photographs, with a bow to the work of Ansel Adams. Viewing the daily moods and changes of the Big Sur territory, Mr. Hooper captures events ranging from the flaming eruption of dawn over the sea to the milky dusk that settles on Soberanes Beach. In his studies of ancient cliff dwellings in the desert, you can almost sense the spirits of the long-gone occupants. No affectations mar this work; the photography is robust, if on the traditional side (Glueck).
 
BILL KOMOSKI, Feature Inc., 76 Greene Street, (212) 941-7077 (through July 23). The reviving interest in abstract painting gives an edge to these four abstract paintings of similar format, loosely based on a grid or net structure. Long loopy strands and rivulets, puddly nonshapes and linear touches convey an idea of liquescence. Bright colors, along with solid and brushy blacks, redeem the deliberate laxity of form. Mr. Komoski has said that "exuberance" and "disquiet" are what he would like to convey in these expressive works; if that goal is not met 100 percent here, he still rates kudos for not pursuing novelty at the expense of painterly exploration (Glueck).
 
MIGUEL ANGEL RIOS AND SERGIO VEGA, CRG, 91 Grand Street, (212) 966-43600 (through July 23). Inspired by an eyewitness account of the 1541 exploration of the Amazon by Europeans, this exhibition of fragile sculptures, installation pieces and 34 drawings continues the Conceptual Art tradition of tackling unwieldy subjects with the slightest of visual means. The results range from sophomoric to reasonably successful, but the antic drawings of the journey's horrors and high points -- Mr. Rios's are the best -- suggest that a comic book treatment may be the only way to do the saga justice (Smith).
 
"SIGNS OF THE TIMES," American Primitive, 594 Broadway, near Houston Street, (212) 966-1530 (through July 25). Quirkiness prevails in this fascinating exhibition of more than 125 signs ranging from the late 19th century to the present. There are pieces of elegant folk art, vintage professionalism and poetic vernacular, like a bent and torn sheet of cardboard with the scrawled words: "I smile only from the truth. I don't wash car windows" (Johnson).
 
Galleries: Chelsea
 
"THE BUREAU OF INVERSE TECHNOLOGY," Postmasters, 459 West 19th Street, (212) 727-3323 (through July 31). The Bureau of Inverse Technology is a group of Neo-Dadaists who think up perverse applications for new technology. Though visually uninteresting, their most intriguing projects operate like chillingly plausible ideas in a dark science-fiction novel. "Suicide Box" proposes to correlate a real-time tracked suicide rate (people leaping from Golden Gate Bridge) with the Dow Jones Industrial Average to generate "a new economic indicator" called the "Despondency Index" (Johnson).
 
SAINT CLAIR CEMIN, Cheim & Read, 521 West 23d Street, (212) 242-7727 (through July 31). Mr. Cemin, one of his generation's most inventive sculptors (he was born in 1951) presents five marmoreal mock monuments, including a sphinx with a smoothly finished woman's face and a roughly carved body; an archaic, cartoonish horse pierced by a stainless-steel spear, and a square wind-filled sail carved from a single block of stone (Johnson).
 
"CHANGING FACES," Jim Kempner, 501 West 23d Street, (212) 206-6872 (through July 24). A crowded, wildly diverse and rewarding selection of 74 contemporary portraits, including Robert Mapplethorpe's luminous photograph of a beatific Alice Neel; John Currin's ink drawing of a winsomely sensual girl; a skittery lithograph by Kiki Smith depicting birds, a cat and someone's sideways head, and tiny, finely made portraits of artists by Jim Torok. Look also for works by Elizabeth Peyton, Chuck Close, David Hockney and William Kentridge (Johnson).
 
"EUROPE ON A SHOESTRING," Weber, 529 West 20th Street, (212) 691-5711 (through July 31). This roundup of European avant-gardists ranges from the amusing to the oblique. Highlights include a Roman Olpalka number painting; Alghiero E. Boetti's enormous steel-framed window with the delightful title, "Nothing to See, Nothing to Hide," and Hans Haacke's "Photo Opportunity," which pairs a portrait of George and Barbara Bush at a storm disaster site with a portrait of a poor Alabama farm family by Walker Evans (Johnson).
 
WADE GUYTON, Andrew Kreps, 529 West 20th Street, (212) 741-8849 (through July 30). Mr. Guyton has removed everything from the gallery's office and storage space and installed a puzzling, roughly made abstract sculpture of slotted Plexiglas units, two oblique architectural photographs and a piece of dark plywood. This stark and harsh environment contrasts sharply with the crowded, anarchic installation of Kreps's complete inventory in the main exhibition space (Johnson).
 
"KILL ALL LIES," Luhring Augustine, 531 West 24th Street, (212) 206-9100 (through July 30). This motley group show is held together by language, subversive intent and different kinds of static. Jean-Michel Basquiat's early graffiti wall writings are recorded in Henry Flynt's handsome color photographs; the 1998 United States bombing of Iraq is the subject of a sound piece by Dara Birnbaum, and Steve DiBennedetto's bright, fragmented abstract paintings are little exploding worlds unto themselves (Smith).
 
B. G. MUHN, Stux, 529 West 20th Street, (212) 352-1600 (through July 31). Mr. Muhn, who was born in Korea and teaches at Georgetown University, produces crafty, surrealistic paintings combining abstract elements, luminous color fields and images that may be highly finished or loosely sketched. Mood ranges from portentous to absurd, as in the picture of a rabbit with a big pink tongue on a tormented-looking bald man's head (Johnson).
 
"THE SEA, THE SEA," Murray Guy, 453 West 17th Street, (212) 463-7372 (through July 30). Among the attractions in this smart, understated selection of works related to oceanic themes are Kay Rosen's bouncy painting of the words "nausea" and "seasick"; deft painterly miniatures by James Sheehan and Pamela Golden; a lush seascape made of cut paper by David Thorpe, and dark, dense, postcard-size pictures of watery surfaces by Michael Blodget (Johnson).
 
"STARS AND STRIPES," Ricco/Maresca, 529 West 20th Street, (212) 627-4819 (through Aug. 14). In this absorbing exhibition of photographs and folk art America's star-spangled banner exerts iconic resonance. In Philip Jones Griffith's photograph "Vietnam," the flag flies in the distance while a soldier washes up in a crater; Jayne Hinds Bidaut's shadowy, contemporary tintypes depict full-bodied nude women wrapped in the flag, and a funky, flag-waving goddess of liberty weather vane, made in 1865, points the way (Johnson).
 
Other Galleries
 
"FOR MYLES," five myles, 558 St. Johns Place, Brooklyn, (718) 783-4438 (through July 24). A new exhibition space opens in Brooklyn with a six-artist show selected by Marian Griffiths, the former Sculpture Center director. Included are a snaky, 27-foot cast-iron spinal column by Jack Pospisil; Michael Lee Poy's globular, cosmically split "Crystal City"; poetic boxed works about hair by Cathleen Lewis; a meditative grid of padded paper and pins by Veronica Ryan; Terry Boddie's mixed-media essays on the martial art Capoelra, and ceremonial tiled stools by Maria Elena Gonzalez (Johnson).
 
ROMUALD HAZOUME, The Project, 421 West 126th Street, Harlem, (212) 662-8610 (through July 25). The first United States show of this West African artist includes two dozen small, masklike sculptures made from industrial and commercial materials: detergent jugs, video cassette casings, electric fan blades. Mr. Hazoume is a deft and witty assemblagist of objects and ideas: references to traditional art, consumer culture and an economy of recycling are all touched on here. In the back gallery are seven airy paintings of oracular pictographic forms painted on layers of earth. A welcome debut (Cotter).
 
* LIZA LOU, "American Glamorama," Grand Central Terminal, (212) 878-7178 (through July 26). The extreme beader Liza Lou followed up her unforgettable "Kitchen" (1995) with the spectacular "Backyard" (1997), on view along with other works in the Main Waiting Room. A life-size tableau of twinkling grass and goofy flowers surrounding a loaded picnic table, a ruby barbecue grill, a glittering lawn mower and more, all realized in zillions of glass beads, "Backyard" is not only a marvel of crafty industry, but also a funky, transcendental transfiguration of an iconic American scene (Johnson).
 
SUSAN WANKLYN, Cheryl Pelavin, 13 Jay Street, Lower Manhattan, (212) 925-9424 (through Sept. 18). To gaze upon Ms. Wanklyn's unassumingly radiant paintings -- shifty interweavings of richly hued translucent bands -- is to surrender to a fine visual hedonism. Ms. Wanklyn creates her luminous plaids using wide brushes and homemade, milk-based casein paint. Her process is transparently simple yet results in complex orchestrations of light, color and form. One moment you feel as if you are looking at a piece of a tablecloth, the next into veiled Rothkoesque space (Johnson).
 
Last Chance
 
JOSE BEDIA, Ramis Barquet, 41 East 57th Street, (212) 644-9090 (through today) and Annina Nosei, 530 West 22d Street, Chelsea, (212) 741-8695 (through today). The best works in this two-gallery show are visionary white line pictures made on shaped and unstretched black canvases. A pointy-eared figure at the top of a crystalline mountain grasps a great flying bird by the tail; a man warms his hands at a fire while a woman with flowing breast milk nurses a phoenix. Mr. Bedia, a Cuban-born artist living in Florida, condenses such fabulous narratives into luminous compositions of Art Deco-like elegance (Johnson).
 
"COLLECTING IN DEPTH: DRAWINGS BY GROSZ, SCHWITTERS, ERNST AND KLEE," Museum of Modern Art, 11 West 53d Street, (212) 708-9400 (through Tuesday). While a little on the dry side, this exhibition effectively encapsulates the careers of four major German modernists, layering their sensibilities like a sandwich and demonstrating the singular uses that each artist found for Cubism. In the outer layers, George Grosz and Paul Klee reformed the tensile lines and transparencies of Analytic Cubism for the purposes, respectively, of scathing social satire and psychologically charged fusions of fantasy and form. In between, Kurt Schwitters and Max Ernst took innovations of Synthetic Cubist collage into new territory. Schwitters used the detritus of everyday life to create a streetwise formalism that indexed different kinds of social interaction and human contact. Ernst extracted found images from their natural habitat in the public press to create a universe as fully imaged as Klee's, only scarier. Hours and admission: See above (Smith).

Consumer Prices Rise in New Jersey

BYLINE: AP 

 BODY:
Consumer prices in southern New Jersey rose 0.6 percent from April to June and 2.4 percent for the year that ended in June, the Federal Bureau of Labor Statistics reported yesterday.
Consumer prices in northern New Jersey rose 0.4 percent from May to June and 2.1 percent for the year that ended in June, the bureau reported. 
 The Consumer Price Index is compiled every two months for southern New Jersey and monthly for northern New Jersey.
Energy price increases were responsible for most of the increase in overall retail prices in southern New Jersey, said Alan M. Paisner, the bureau's regional commissioner in Philadelphia.
Seasonal factors accounted for most of the increase in northern New Jersey, said John L. Wieting, the bureau's regional commissioner in New York, citing increases in electricity prices and out-of-town lodging charges.

HEADLINE: Once, Conservatives Knew the Value of Transportation

BYLINE: By Bud Shuster; Bud Shuster, a Republican from Pennsylvania, is chairman of the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
Abraham Lincoln called Senator Henry Clay "my beau ideal," largely because he was dedicated to building America. Clay, whose nickname was "Capital Improvements Harry," helped pass legislation to construct roads and inland waterways to tie America together. During the Civil War, Lincoln authorized the construction of the first transcontinental railroad. Teddy Roosevelt championed the Panama Canal, and Dwight Eisenhower created the Interstate System.
Fiscally responsible Republicans, all. 
 Fortunately, most modern-day conservatives still believe in building America. Witness the strong support last year from conservatives at all levels of government for the Transportation Equity Act, which unlocked Eisenhower's highway trust fund and allowed it to be used for its intended purpose of improving highways and transit systems.
Unfortunately, some conservatives seem dedicated to breathing new life into Benjamin Disraeli's adage that "it is much easier to be critical than to be correct." These critics have little inclination to deal in facts or face the reality of a growing America. They know the cost of everything but the value of nothing. Some have called this "Know-Nothing Conservatism."
They criticize increased spending on transportation, but they do not differentiate between transportation trust-fund dollars and general tax dollars. They do not tell you that the trust fund receives money from an 18.3-cent-per-gallon tax on gasoline and an 8 percent surcharge on airline tickets, all of which is designated solely to pay for our country's transportation needs.
These conservative critics oppose investments by trying to discredit them. They call spending on public works in someone else's backyard a pork barrel project, but that is far from the truth. In the Transportation Equity Act, for example, only 5 percent of the money goes to Congressionally mandated projects. The rest goes to the Department of Transportation or to the states.
This year, some conservatives are once again keeping their heads buried in the sand. The House overwhelmingly passed the Aviation Investment and Reform Act last month, by a vote of 316 to 110; 67 percent of Republicans -- including the Speaker and the majority leader -- approved of this measure.
But this didn't stop some conservative critics from immediately attacking the bill as "busting the budget" and "fiscally irresponsible."
Never mind that many Americans are furious over the decline in air service. Never mind that our antiquated air-traffic control system, which fails somewhere nearly every week, needs both reform and an infusion of capital investment.
Never mind that the National Civil Aviation Review Commission established by our Republican Congress warns that "the United States aviation system is headed toward gridlock shortly after the turn of the century" and that "it will result in a deterioration of aviation safety, harm the efficiency and growth of our domestic economy, and hurt our position in the global marketplace."
Never mind that the money in the aviation trust fund will skyrocket to $90 billion within 10 years if we don't make the investment. Never mind that the aviation taxes would otherwise be used in smoke-and-mirrors budget gimmickry to help finance general tax cuts. Never mind that the bill does not contain any projects earmarked for any specific Congressional districts.
And never mind that some "Know-Nothing" conservatives in the media will attack this session for being a "do nothing" Congress. The one thing Congress is doing, over their objections, is building assets for the future of our country.
Perhaps the next time they attack Government spending, they might reflect on an observation by the columnist George Will: "Many of today's conservatives rallied 'round keeping control of the Panama Canal. But would such conservatives have built it in the first place?"

Optimism on Corporate Profits Lifts Dow to Another High

BYLINE: By Reuters 

 BODY:
Stocks powered ahead across the board yesterday, capping a week of record-setting sessions as Wall Street toasted good corporate earnings.
The Dow Jones industrial average rose 23.43 points, or two-tenths of a percent, to 11,209.84, beating Monday's record of 11,200.98.
The technology-laden Nasdaq composite index gained 25.11 points, or nine-tenths of a percent, to 2,864.48, its third consecutive record finish. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index set its second consecutive record, rising 9.16 points, or seven-tenths of a percent, to 1,418.78.
In the broader market, declining issues edged out advances 1,481 to 1,474 on active trading of 714 million shares on the New York Stock Exchange.
The price of the 30-year Treasury bond rose 1 3/32, to 91 6/32. The bond's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, fell to 5.88 percent from 5.91 percent on Thursday.
"Usually options expirations bring some extra oomph, but we didn't see that this week," said Barry Hyman, analyst at Ehrenkrantz King Nussbaum Inc.
The week ended with a double expiration: stock options and index options.
Despite setting records on Monday and yesterday, the Dow Jones industrial average was ahead only 16.14 points for the week.
"This has been a technology rally and I think that's good for the overall market," Mr. Hyman said. "The technology sector has been and will remain the leading sector."
But he said that with many technology issues looking very expensive based on their charts, it would be good to see more rotation into economically sensitive stocks.
In the only major United States economic data out yesterday, the Federal Reserve reported that output by factories, mines and utilities gained two-tenths of a percent last month, the same as in May. It was the fifth consecutive monthly increase.
Notwithstanding steadily rising output, businesses ran at 80.3 percent of their maximum capacity in June, down slightly from 80.4 in May.
Peter Canelo, a Morgan Stanley Dean Witter market strategist, raised his 1999 profit growth outlook for the companies in the Standard & Poor's 500 index to 14 percent from 12 percent.
Among the active stocks, Microsoft jumped 5 1/16, to 99 7/16, on a report that the software giant was close to creating a stock to track its Microsoft Network business.
Microsoft also benefited from news that a Federal jury in Connecticut found that the company did not violate antitrust law in a suit brought by a small Connecticut software company.
Air Products and Chemicals fell 4 3/8, to 36 15/16, after it issued a profit warning for its fiscal third quarter because of pressure on its equipment and chemicals businesses. Earlier in the week, Air Products and Air Liquide of France announced a bid for BOC Group P.L.C. of Britain.

HEADLINE: Caterpillar Sees Profit Growth Slowing in '99

BYLINE: By DAVID BARBOZA 

DATELINE: CHICAGO, July 16

 BODY:
After months of hinting at a turnaround, Caterpillar Inc., the maker of construction and earth-moving equipment, warned investors yesterday that profit growth would continue to slide this year.
The warning came after Caterpillar said that its second-quarter profits had fallen 36.5 percent from a year earlier because of slumping demand for heavy machines and equipment. It was the fourth consecutive quarterly profit decline for Caterpillar. 
 Shares of Caterpillar fell 18.75 cents, to $58.9375, on the New York Stock Exchange.
The company said it revised its outlook because sales of more profitable machines and equipment, like mining trucks, had dipped while sales of less profitable equipment, like truck engines, had gained -- upsetting the more favorable profit mix that had been the basis for an earlier projection.
Second-quarter sales were $5.1 billion, Caterpillar said, down from $5.6 billion in the second quarter of last year, and profits in the latest quarter were $283 million, down from $446 million a year earlier. Earnings per share were 78 cents, slightly below Wall Street expectations and down from $1.20.
Wall Street analysts said they were disappointed by the results and by the company's warning, but several analysts said investors were already looking ahead to early next year.
"Caterpillar, at this point, is a 2000 story," said David Bleustein, an analyst at Paine Webber. "We expect the benefits of the global recovery to more than offset any slowdown there might be here in the United States."
That turnaround, however, was expected to come earlier this year. In March, Caterpillar executives sounded an upbeat note at a convention in Las Vegas, Nev., saying that signs of a recovery in Asia, corporate belt-tightening and a push to diversify its business could put the company on sound footing in 1999.
But today, the company pushed that optimism further out, saying that it did not expect a big jump in profits until the fourth quarter of this year.
"We're trying to fix this," said F. Lynn McPheeters, chief financial officer at Caterpillar, which is based in Peoria, Ill. "We thought the mix of business would turn a little earlier."
Although Caterpillar says its warning grew out of a slowdown in the sale of more profitable mining and oil exploration equipment, the company pegged its yearlong profit slump to a recession in parts of Asia, Latin America, Africa and the Middle East and weakness in the mining and oil exploration industry.
Despite those problems, Caterpillar executives say the company has made great strides in diversifying its mix of businesses, noting gains in everything from solar turbines to truck engines and financial services.
Revenue in 1998 was a record $21 billion, and this year the company expects revenue to be slightly below that figure. Profits, though, could be down 20 percent to 25 percent because of fierce competition and the unexpected slump in some of the company's most profitable products, the company said. Although profits dipped last year to $1.5 billion, it was the third consecutive year the company recorded a profit of more than $1 billion. Even with a sharp slowdown, the company could still earn $1 billion this year.
"We'll have profits that are down but reasonable, considering the recession we've had in many of our businesses," Mr. McPheeters said today in a telephone interview.
He also said that the company had already seen a slight upturn in Asia, the only region where sales gained from a year earlier, and that Caterpillar had not yet benefited from a Federal highway bill that recently went into effect.
The company said it would continue to benefit from cost reduction put into place a year ago, and there are expectations for a solid fourth quarter, with some analysts estimating a profit jump of 40 percent or more from a year ago, when Caterpillar suffered a steep decline.
Wall Street analysts, though less optimistic in March than the company was at that time, now say they believe the company's fortunes will turn in 2000. While several analysts dropped their third-quarter and year-end estimates, according to the First Call Corporation, which surveys analysts, no analyst altered a prediction for next year.
"This is being seen as a one-quarter problem," said Charles Hill, director of research at First Call. "This is a pretty mild analyst reaction."

HEADLINE: Talks Halt On Bombing Of Embassy In Belgrade

BYLINE: By SETH FAISON 

DATELINE: BEIJING, July 16

 BODY:
Chinese and American officials wound up two days of negotiations today on compensation for the NATO bombing of the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade, without reaching an agreement.
An American official said talks would resume later this month. 
 The stalemate was a disappointment to officials who had hoped an agreement would clear a persistent stumbling block in relations between the two as a potential military conflict brews over Taiwan.
Presidents Clinton and Jiang Zemin have each expressed a desire to recover some of the good will that was lost over sharply diverging views of the NATO air campaign in Kosovo and that was further eroded by the embassy bombing in May. Yet the deadlock, after inconclusive bickering about money, appeared to represent a clash of midlevel officials who represent the less forgiving sides of their respective Governments.
An American official familiar with the talks described the officials' sharply different approaches as a "complete disconnect."
"It was lawyers' talking at lawyers," the official said. "Entirely different mind-sets."
If money was the topic, the underlying issue for China seemed to be an obsession with regaining national pride that it feels was wounded in the bombing and harmed further by what it regards as an utter lack of remorse by the Americans. Beijing has rejected American explanations that the bombing was an accident.
On the American side, lawyers in the delegation were most worried about setting a precedent for future compensation cases, to the extent that they even refused to use the term "compensation" in the talks, saying "humanitarian payments" instead.
A legal adviser to the State Department who headed the American team, David Andrews, issued a short statement that called the substance of the talks sensitive and complex. Progress was made, Mr. Andrews said, but he did not elaborate.
What is so sensitive and complex appears to be the starting point that Chinese officials still see the bombing as a deliberate attack on the Chinese nation, making them unwilling to discuss other bilateral issues until the bombing question has been resolved.
A senior Chinese official, Zhao Qi zheng, elaborated on the Chinese view on Thursday at a news conference. He ridiculed the American explanation that they hit the wrong target because of defective intelligence and outdated maps, comparing the odds that three outdated maps were used simultaneously to rolling dice and getting triple snake eyes.
"The chances of throwing a one, that's 1 out of 6," said Mr. Zhao, who heads the Information Office of the State Council, or China's Cabinet. "If you roll three dice, it is 1 out of 216. If you add in other errors, that is like rolling 10 dice. The chances are close to nothing."
Chinese officials have demanded compensation for the families of three Chinese who died in the bombing and for 20 who were injured, as well as for damage to the building. They have also asked that those responsible for the bombing be identified and punished.
In response, the Americans have demanded reciprocal compensation for damage to the United States Embassy in Beijing, where rock-throwing broke virtually every window in one building. The United State Consulate in another city, Chengdu, was burned in a riot.
"The United States hopes to make these payments as soon as possible," Mr. Andrews's statement said. "Both sides also raised their respective property claims."
A spokesman for the American Embassy said that Mr. Andrews would leave Beijing on Saturday and that he or someone else would resume talks at the end of the month.
Without a resolution over the bombing, officials say, it may be difficult for Washington and Beijing to regain footing on another, arguably far more significant, issue, China's entry to the World Trade Organization.
China's effort to join the organization, desired both by China's leaders and by the Clinton Administration, now looks increasingly vulnerable.
For a deal to go through this year, an agreement between the United States and China would essentially have to be worked out before Presidents Clinton and Jiang meet in September at the Asia Pacific Economic Conference in New Zealand. If this year's deadline is not met, China's entry may be delayed for several years, a potentially serious setback to China's ability to effect much-needed reforms in its state-owned industries.
China's top trade negotiator, Long Yongtu, said again this week that China would not resume trade talks until the bombing issue had been resolved.

HEADLINE: Industrial Production Gained 0.2% in June

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 16

 BODY:
Industrial production in the United States rose in June, the seventh month without a decline, led by increased demand for automobiles, computers and electricity.
Output at factories, mines and utilities rose two-tenths of a percent last month, capping a 3.9 percent second-quarter annualized increase, the Federal Reserve said today. The quarterly pace was the fastest in one and a half years and triple the first quarter's rate. 
 The Fed's industrial production report showed that manufacturing output rose one-tenth of a percent in June after rising three-tenths of a percent in May. Manufacturing grew at a 4.1 percent annual pace in the second quarter, up from a 1.5 percent rate in the first three months of the year.
Output of autos and trucks rose 2.7 percent last month, and home electronics rose 2 percent, accounting for almost all of the June factory increase.
Production of computers and office equipment rose 2.7 percent. For the second quarter, output of computers rose at a 48 percent annual pace, up from a first-quarter rate of 33.7 percent.
But production of carpeting and furniture fell half a percent, output of construction supplies declined six-tenths of a percent and appliance output dropped three-tenths of a percent. Analysts said the declines probably reflected the recent flattening of home sales.
The overall plant-use rate, which measures industrial capacity in use, fell to 80.3 percent in June from 80.4 percent in May. Analysts had expected a June reading of 80.4 percent. May was previously reported at 80.5 percent.

HEADLINE: West Virginia, Home Of the Gray in America

BYLINE: By FRANCIS X. CLINES 

DATELINE: DUNBAR, W.Va., July 14

 BODY:
Ken Hechler may be the only candidate in the post-Monica era of American politics who gets away with singling out female strangers in a crowd of constituents, holding out his arms and grinning as he gently asks, "May I give you a hug?"
In receiving multiple hugs today for his daring, the merry-eyed Mr. Hechler, West Virginia's elected Secretary of State for the past 15 years, was helped by the fact that he is an 84-year-old political legend who was wooing a sea of gray-haired retirees at the crowded Kanawha Valley Senior Services picnic. 
 The tableau was revealing. For West Virginia now has the oldest per capita population in the union, having overtaken Florida in 1996. Its senior residents, in the upper half of a population with a median age of 38.6 (Florida's is 38.3), include a record tide of returning natives who choose to come home to retire after careers elsewhere.
"A significant factor in their return is the intrinsic bond in the Appalachian culture between the people and their land," said Thomas L. Dudley, research director for the state Bureau of Senior Services. Recent studies, he said, have established the state as leading the nation in attracting back original residents for retirement. They come in particular from urban areas in the East, attracted by West Virginia's lower cost of living and its rural, recreational spirit.
The current estimate is that with the elderly now accounting for 15 of every 100 state residents, the graying trend will continue upward to almost 25 per 100 by the first quarter of the new century. The state, which is widely recruiting non-native retirees the way Florida does, is making adjustments, with its older residents far more politically active than its young.
It is no wonder that Mr. Hechler, unfinished with a political career seeded in the Presidency of Franklin D. Roosevelt, has decided that a politician as old as he can be the wave of the future. Though he would seem a shoo-in for re-election to his state office, he has decided to run next year for his old seat in Congress, from which he retired after 18 years in 1976, turning to state politics.
"Life is a series of challenges and I don't want to just coast along here," said Mr. Hechler, a classic maverick who already has banjo-picking campaign advertisements on the radio.
To counter any bias that he is too old, he is offering his four younger primary challengers free baseball throws at him next week when he sits on the dunking stool at the Berkeley County Democratic picnic.
He campaigns from a signature red Jeep, always with young people at his side, often mentioning the four times a week he plays tennis. ("I'm saving golf for my old age.")
"With the oldest age average in the country, we don't expect any age bias in our politics," said Robert Perelman, the president of the rapidly growing state chapter of the American Association of Retired Persons. Mr. Perelman, 77, is a former chemical plant supervisor who teaches skiing in the winter.
Mr. Hechler is not alone as a political patriarch. West Virginia's Republican Governor, Cecil H. Underwood, is 76 and a phenomenon himself, having been the nation's boy-wonder Governor in 1956 at age 34, and then returning to politics in 1996 to be elected the oldest Governor.
"We're learning seniors do vote, but also that politicians will live longer and be more active, too," Earl Jarvis, director of Kanawha Valley Senior Services, said of the evolving lesson of West Virginia. "I'm encouraging more of my people to run for public office."
Mr. Hechler has lived a rich life as a college professor, a researcher for President Roosevelt, a speech writer for President Harry S. Truman, a book writer ("The Bridge at Remagen," a best seller about the World War II crossing of the Rhine) and an elected politician. In Congress, he bucked the state's coal industry and capped his career in Washington with the landmark Coal Mine Health and Safety Act of 1969.
He wants to go back to Washington for far more than the obvious issues brought up at the seniors' picnic, which are keeping Social Security and health-care programs effective for the elderly. He passionately campaigns for stronger controls on political fund-raising and handguns and for a half-dozen other issues, telling voters he can hardly be seeking a long, safe House career anchored in poll-tailored evasions.
"God will be setting my term limit," says Mr. Hechler rather nonchalantly. "But I don't want to be known as the candidate of the seniors," he insists. A native New Yorker, he moved here in the 1950's, fresh from working in the idealistic campaigns of Adlai E. Stevenson, to teach political science at Marshall College and try to engender fresh interest in politics among the young.
"He's a legend," said Bill Walker, a 24-year-old political science student from Marshall working the picnic crowd at Mr. Hechler's side as a summer intern. "Just to someday look back and say I learned politics from Mr. Hechler is a great honor," said the student. He exuded the kind of dedication seen in the young interns in a state program in which elderly mountaineers have been reinstilling the art of fiddle-playing. The skill had nearly been lost when earlier generations were forced to emigrate to find work.
"I'll tell you, people my age are soured on politics lately," said Mr. Walker, who is determined to run for office at the earliest opportunity.
As the elderly come to the fore, state politics are shifting to consider issues like how the revenue base will hold up as more retirees claim special tax abatements. "Most studies show incoming retirees are actually increasing the economic base," said Mr. Dudley of state senior services. "They bring in an average of $250,000 in liquid assets, and they're a tremendous resource in volunteer work, politics and civics."
Like all states, West Virginia faces the potential trauma from the retirement of a wide swath of talent when the baby-boom generation hits 65. "We'll feel it a little quicker," Mr. Dudley said. But he noted there were all sorts of variables, including a slow but promising reversal from the state's traditional loss of young workers, plus a redefinition of retirement itself.
"Close to half of the Governor's cabinet came out of retirement to serve," noted Mr. Dudley, who is busy preparing for Governor Underwood's regional conference in September on the problems and opportunities of the elderly. Next year, West Virginia will play a principal role in the United Nations' International Year of the Older Person as host of the conference on rural health.
Mr. Hechler appreciates those issues but puts more passion into railing against mechanized mountaintop coal mining and its effects on the environment, citizenry and general attractiveness of West Virginia now that all the retirees are flocking in. He has been hiking the state on this issue, just as he has been hiking nationally for campaign finance reform, a buoyant old New Dealer come round one more time.
"Oh, that's Ken Hechler," an elderly woman told her friend as the candidate confronted them at the picnic. "You ought to know him -- he's been around 100 years."
Mr. Hechler, a whippet on the hustings, responded: "One hundred years! Whoopee!" And he asked if he might give the woman a hug.

HEADLINE: Iran's View of U.S.: Evil, Bumbling or Unimportant

BYLINE: By ELAINE SCIOLINO 

DATELINE: TEHERAN, Iran, July 16

 BODY:
At Friday Prayers here at noon today, the United States was presented as the all-powerful hidden hand behind Iran's worst civil unrest in two decades.
In a docudrama on television a few hours later that included clips of Jimmy Carter and Sam Donaldson, America was presented as an inept, pagan military giant that could not even rescue its own hostages in 1980 because God was on the other side. 
 The two vastly different characterizations underscore the contradictions in the official Iranian view of the United States.
On the one hand, the United States is blamed as the evil mastermind behind every misfortune -- the recent political unrest, the crippled economy, the dramatic fall of Iran's currency and the cultural pollution of the youth. On the other, the United States is scorned as the helpless superpower that has tried over the years to destroy the Islamic Republic but has failed miserably.
Then there is a third view, espoused by the reformist newspapers that back President Mohammad Khatami, that Iran can no longer play the role of victim and has to solve its own problems.
"Why do we accuse the foreign enemy, instead of acknowledging the truth and finding our own weakness?" an editorial in the newspaper Khordad asked about the violent street demonstrations of the last week. "Do we have a foreign enemy that is so strong that it managed to penetrate and riot even in the most central streets of Teheran?"
But that was not the view expressed at Teheran University, the country's biggest official platform. There, the Government sent Hassan Taheri Khoramabadi, the most junior of the four rotating speakers at Friday Prayers, to address the tens of thousands of worshipers.
American meddling was part of a plot to destroy Iran's economy, the cleric said. "America wants to prove to the European and our neighboring countries and the Middle Eastern countries that there is no stability in Iran, that there's anarchy here," he said. "That way the others would not have relations and do business with Iran."
"Death to America!" the crowd chanted.
Mr. Khoramabadi said nothing less than the demise of the revolution was the goal of the American-backed protesters. "It is the revolution that they have taken aim at," he warned.
"Death to America!" the crowd chanted again.
He asked the country's top leaders to define "a red line for the revolution" that no one would be allowed to cross. "Differences in a family can be tolerated, but there have to be unbreakable limits," he said.
"Death to America!" the crowd chanted again.
So it went all through the sermon.
Fourteen months ago at the same pavilion on the first anniversary of his election, Mr. Khatami had a different message, a call to end the clergy's tight hold on power. He silenced a group of students when they uttered the familiar, "Death to America!"
"I prefer to talk about life, not death," he said, to cheering and clapping, considered an un-Islamic and Western affectation.
But the strategy did not work.
"The regime is like a shop that is selling this slogan," said a political science professor at Teheran University who a few days ago was willing to speak on the record but is no longer. "If they lose this slogan, they have nothing left to sell."
On the docudrama this afternoon, one of the most popular viewing times of the week, a different sort of anti-Americanism was on display, "Sandstorm," an officially produced film about the failed military raid by the United States to free American hostages in April 1980.
The use of television footage from the crisis lent an authenticity to the film. It showed Mr. Carter in his signature cardigan sweater in the Oval Office, consulting with Vice President Walter F. Mondale and other top aides; Mr. Donaldson, with long sideburns, reporting the seizure of the American Embassy on ABC News on Nov. 4, 1979, and an English-speaking hostage taker who interviewed blacks and women among the hostages. The hostages were released "on humanitarian grounds."
The rescue mission was a horrific combination of bad luck and poor planning. The plan was to raid the embassy from a staging area deep in the Iranian desert. The mission was halted after three of the eight helicopters involved had been put out of action by technical problems. In the evacuation, a helicopter collided with a C-130 transport plane. Eight Americans died. The evacuating Americans left behind a battlefield scene of burned and abandoned equipment, and their comrades' bodies.
The 90-minute film portrays the Americans as ruthless, obscenity-spouting veterans of Vietnam eager to free the hostages -- and perhaps restore the monarchy in the process.
"By tomorrow, we will have Iran in our hands," the commander said in the film.
"Tell me, old soldier, do you mean we're going to have a military coup?" asked the pilot.
"Did you think we're going with no plan and no invitation into the heart of the enemy?" the commander replied.
Much of the film was accurate. It portrayed a team of American spies' posing as journalists as they watched the embassy from a hotel across the street.
But like any docudrama, distortions abounded. The main Persian-speaking spy was a Zionist, who wears a yarmulke. When an American commando tried to pray, his commander did not let him finish.
The end of the film showed actual film of the rescuers' crash site and the eight bodies.
"Who stopped Carter's helicopters?" a male voice asked at the film's end, a quote from the late Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, the father of Iran's revolution. "We stopped it. The sands stopped it. They were God's messenger."
In the reformist newspapers, a different sort of "dialogue" is being conducted.
The crackdown against the protesters and the pledge by the authorities to use all necessary means to prevent more trouble may have stilled the students, at least for the moment. But the move has emboldened commentators in several newspapers, who are writing in ways that they would not have dared even a few weeks ago.
The newspapers have become a voice of the country's conscience, demanding that Iran look for the reasons behind the unrest at home, not abroad.
One argument is that years of restrictions have led youths to rebel.
"When our kids are at school, they only hear things like, 'Do not do this, do not do that,' " Shahla Ezazi, a sociologist, wrote on Thursday in Neshat. "Instead of learning to become independent citizens capable of living in society, they react this way."

HEADLINE: Legislators In Nassau Approve Tax On Land Sales

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HALBFINGER 

DATELINE: GARDEN CITY, N.Y., July 16

 BODY:
Voting along party lines, the Nassau Legislature today approved a new 1 percent tax on property sales to help solve the county's deepening financial crisis. But Republicans in the majority made no public mention of the fiscal reforms they have conceded are necessary to rein in the county's budgetary practices.
Democrats in the State Assembly, whose approval is necessary before the new tax becomes law, have insisted that they will not do so unless Nassau agrees to tough oversight measures. Among other things, they want the State Comptroller, H. Carl McCall, to be given approval power over all Nassau budgets and bond issues. The county's debt has been downgraded to near-junk levels in recent weeks, and bond-rating agencies have criticized the County Executive, Thomas S. Gulotta, for consistently spending more than the county raises in taxes. 
 An emergency legislative session called by Mr. Gulotta was delayed for hours this morning as Republicans sought to agree on measures that would satisfy the Assembly.
Officials involved in the private talks said the Republicans were amenable to giving Mr. McCall a seat on a new outside financial board that would be empowered to send Mr. Gulotta's budgets back for revision. But when told that any such measure would require a countywide referendum, the Republicans gave up, the officials said.
Frustrated, legislators from both parties then spent much of the day belittling Mr. Gulotta's budget director, Michael Fabiano.
They criticized him for asking for the new property-sales tax without having made any firm estimate of how much money it would contribute toward reducing the county's deficit of more than $200 million. "How much time would you need?" Presiding Officer Bruce A. Blakeman asked. "We'll give you a calculator. We'll give you a room."
Democrats lambasted Mr. Fabiano and Mr. Gulotta, who was not present, for never having put their deficit-cutting measures into writing.
"Where is the plan?" asked the minority leader, Judith A. Jacobs. "I have to assume there is no plan. There's a wish list."
Mr. Fabiano said that Mr. Gulotta's plan was really a "menu" of items, including tax increases and cost savings. "It's a fluid document," he said.
One legislator, Barbara J. Johnson, a Democrat from Port Washington, said, referring to the rating agencies that downgraded the county's bonds, "If this is the presentation you made to Moody's and Standard & Poor's, I can see why they downgraded us."

HEADLINE: Fears of Military Confrontation With China Shake Taiwan Financial Markets

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER 

DATELINE: HONG KONG, July 16

 BODY:
Fears of a military confrontation with China swept through financial markets in Taiwan today, causing the biggest single-day plunge in the stock index in nine years.
In a panicky wave of selling that began on rumors of Chinese military action against Taiwan, the Taipei stock index fell 6.4 percent, or 506 points, to close at 7,411. The jitters spread across the region, with stock markets' dropping in Tokyo, Hong Kong and Singapore. 
 Tensions between China and Taiwan have been growing since last weekend, when President Lee Teng-hui of Taiwan unexpectedly dropped the long-held premise that Taiwan and China are separately governed parts of the same country. Mr. Lee declared that the countries ought to negotiate on a "state-to-state" basis.
The Chinese Government responded with denunciations of Mr. Lee and warnings that it was ready to use military force to stop Taiwan from declaring independence from China. The warning led newspapers in Hong Kong to report that China might seize a couple of islands off Taiwan as a show of force.
Military officials in Taiwan flatly denied the reports, saying they had detected no Chinese military movements. But the damage was done. Despite aggressive buying of shares by the Government this week, Taiwan's market has fallen more than 13 percent since the dispute erupted.
Domestic politics has deepened the instability. A popular former Governor of Taiwan, James Soong, announced today that he would break away from the governing Nationalist Party and run for president next year as an independent. Although Mr. Soong's move was widely expected, it exposed a fissure in the party, which has governed Taiwan for 50 years.
Some analysts said they worried that prolonged instability could derail the economy, which managed to get through the Asian crisis largely unscathed and had been picking up steam lately.
"We're expecting a low-intensity confrontation across the straits, which could last until the presidential elections next year," Dong Tao, a regional strategist at Credit Suisse First Boston in Hong Kong, said. "Obviously, the longer it lasts, the more negative the impact on the economy would be."
Mr. Tao said Taiwan was more vulnerable to a crisis of confidence than other countries, because a large percentage of people's wealth is tied up in stocks. So a further drop in share prices could cause a decline in consumer spending.
Taiwan's economy is driven by exports, particularly semiconductor chips and other computer components. A growing confrontation could prompt computer companies in the United States to cancel orders.
"It happened in 1995, it could happen again," Mr. Tao said, referring to a dispute in which China conducted military exercises and tested ballistic missiles near Taiwan. That crisis, defused after President Clinton sent two aircraft carrier groups to the region in 1996, had measurable negative effects on the country's growth.
Before the verbal fireworks this week Taiwan had emerged as the economic star of Asia. Although the country never fell into a wrenching recession like its rivals Hong Kong and Singapore, its growth slowed, from 6.8 percent in 1997 to 4.8 percent last year. After a shaky start this year, analysts said, Taiwan's domestic spending and exports had picked up strongly.
In January, Credit Suisse First Boston predicted that Taiwan's economy would grow 3.5 percent in 1999. In May, it raised its forecast, to 5.2 percent. Mr. Tao said the firm had been on the verge of raising it again, to 6 percent. Now, however, he said it would hold off until the end of the current crisis.
"From time to time, China finds ways to make Taiwan feel uncomfortable," Mr. Tao said. "I don't think it would go so far as to fire missiles."
Few experts said they believed that the tension would escalate into a shooting war. Some even said the sharp drop in the Taiwanese market is a good opportunity to invest. But the sell off was a reminder that the Asian recovery is a fragile phenomenon, driven by market psychology, as well as economic fundamentals.

HEADLINE: House Supports Trade Benefits To Aid Africa

BYLINE: By ERIC SCHMITT 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 16

 BODY:
The House approved a far-ranging American economic initiative for Africa today that offers enhanced trade benefits in exchange for the adoption of free-market practices by African nations.
The bill, passed by a vote of 234 to 163, would authorize quota-free and duty-free imports from 48 sub-Saharan African countries, including some of the world's poorest nations, for 10 years, with a particular focus on textiles and apparel. African-made textiles currently face import taxes of 15 percent to 25 percent. 
 If the legislation, known as the African Growth and Opportunity Act, were to become law, it would be the first major trade-promotion measure enacted in the United States since the 1994 North American Free Trade Agreement that established duty-free commerce between Canada, the United States and Mexico.
The African legislation has been quietly percolating through Congress for months. President Clinton, who has strongly supported such a measure since he visited Africa in 1998, began a concerted effort to push for passage earlier this year. House Speaker J. Dennis Hastert of Illinois is also a strong supporter.
But the legislation still faces big opposition in the Senate, which rejected a similar measure last year. It also comes against a backdrop of increased trade protectionism in the United States, where companies in industries like steel and textiles fear a rising tide of inexpensive imports could hurt profits and jobs.
Proponents of the African legislation contend that United States trade with Africa is relatively small and any increased imports from Africa would have no harmful effects on the healthy American economy. American merchandise exports to the region totaled $6.7 billion in 1998 while imports from Africa amounted to $13.4 billion. By comparison, United States trade with Japan alone totaled $180 billion last year, according to Commerce Department figures.
The bill's supporters also contend that removing all quotas and taxes on African products would stimulate economic growth in the region and nurture the increasing number of fledgling democracies there.
"This will open a new era in U.S. relations with sub-Saharan Africa," said Representative Bill Archer, a Texas Republican who heads the House Ways and Means Committee.
After today's vote, Charlene Barshefsky, the United States trade representative, said in a statement that the House had taken "a vital step toward promoting further economic growth and reform in Africa."
The prospects for Senate passage are unclear, even though its version of the bill is more restrictive.. It would require, for example, that African nations use American raw materials in the manufacture of their textile exports to the United States.
The Senate version is also incorporated into broader trade legislation that includes a Caribbean Basin Initiative, backed by Senator Trent Lott of Mississippi, the majority leader.
"U.S. policy has virtually ignored Africa," said Senator Richard Lugar, an Indiana Republican who is the Senate's main sponsor of the measure. "This bill encourages a transition from aid to trade for sub-Saharan countries committed to economic and political reform."
The bill does not affect foreign aid to African countries.
Opposition in the House and Senate comes largely from Southeastern lawmakers from districts with large numbers of textile workers.
"Everyone here wants to help Africa, but we don't want to do it on the backs of U.S. workers," said Representative Richard M. Burr, a North Carolina Republican whose district around Winston-Salem includes 22,000 textile employees.
Textile and apparel imports from sub-Saharan Africa represented less than 1 percent, or $383 million, of the $46 billion worth of all such imports in 1996, according to the International Trade Commission. A commission study found that even if all quotas and duties were removed, African textiles would still probably remain below 2 percent of total United States textile imports in the next 10 years.
Opponents say they do not fear direct competition from African businesses. Rather, they are concerned that large quantities of inexpensive textiles from countries like China may be shipped illegally through Africa to the United States. Supporters insist that the bill includes tough safeguards against that practice, called transshipment.
"It will be a national holiday in China when we pass this bill," said Representative Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina Republican.
The trade bill divided House Democrats, many of whom complained that the Africa legislation failed to include adequate protections for African workers and the environment. In today's vote, 136 Republicans and 98 Democrats supported the bill, while 63 Republicans, 99 Democrats and one independent opposed it.
Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, the Democratic leader, voted for the bill, while Representative David E. Bonior of Michigan, the Democratic whip, or No. 2 official, voted against it. Mr. Gephardt, however, opposes a Caribbean Basin Initiative and would oppose combining it with the Africa bill.
The Congressional Black Caucus was also badly riven over the bill. Representative Charles B. Rangel of New York, the ranking Democrat on Ways and Means, has championed the Africa trade bill over the last several years, and personally lobbied several wavering Democrats, House aides said.
But 14 of the black caucus's 36 members opposed the bill today, led by Representative Jesse Jackson Jr., an Illinois Democrat. These critics say that multinational companies will exploit African workers, and that the bill does not address other crucial issues like debt relief and AIDS in Africa.
"Tell me where in this bill it says multinationals must hire African workers?" Mr. Jackson said during today's debate on the House floor.

HEADLINE: Agreement at Last in Albany On $73 Billion Budget Plan

BYLINE: By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA 

DATELINE: ALBANY, July 16

 BODY:
Three and a half months after the state budget was due, legislative leaders and Gov. George E. Pataki have agreed to the outlines of a $73 billion deal, legislators and top aides said today. The plan would preserve a prekindergarten program and make no new cuts in health care, while salting away $1.8 billion to pay for future tax cuts.
The Assembly Speaker, Sheldon Silver, and the Senate majority leader, Joseph L. Bruno, told legislators today to return to Albany on Monday, in order to convene conference committees to draft a detailed budget over the next week or two. 
 The news follows one of the most rancorous proceedings in what has become, in recent years, a uniformly rancorous process. For months, Mr. Silver has accused the Governor of sacrificing New York's needs to his ambitions for national office, while Mr. Pataki has charged that the Speaker was trying to spend so much that the state would rack up huge deficits and would have to forgo promised tax cuts.
This year, for the first time, a state law provides that legislators' salaries will be withheld as long as the budget is overdue, adding friction to an already heated atmosphere.
Last year, the two houses of the Legislature passed a spending plan that pleased nearly everyone, only to have the Governor veto $1.6 billion worth of items in it, most of them programs prized by the Democrats. That experience cast a long shadow over this year's budget talks, with Mr. Silver determined not to repeat it.
This week's breakthrough, officials said, rested in part on Mr. Pataki's assurances that he would not make widespread use of his veto pen this year -- though some vetoes remain likely -- as long as the Legislature remains within the agreed-to boundaries.
The legislative leaders had agreed weeks ago to spend about $1.1 billion more than Mr. Pataki proposed in January, but the Governor had indicated that their figure was a few hundred million dollars too high. In the last few days, Mr. Pataki agreed to the $1.1 billion in additions, but how one arrives at that number relies heavily on widely varying estimates of what some programs will cost, and he insisted on calculating more conservatively than Mr. Silver had hoped. There is still no accord on precisely how to reach that number, and officials warned that the agreement could fall apart on this issue.
Word of progress was met with wary relief by state officials who are painfully aware that tentative deals here have a habit of imploding over the finer points. "There is very nearly an agreement, but the operative words here are 'very nearly,' " said Zenia Mucha, Mr. Pataki's communications director.
Today, Mr. Silver and Mr. Bruno issued a joint statement, saying that they were "in virtual agreement" on an overall spending figure. Aides and legislators said the statement understates how close to a final deal the Legislature is, with the leaders having already agreed to a rough division of the money by category.
In intensive negotiations over the last six weeks, Mr. Pataki, Mr. Silver and Mr. Bruno at least partly abandoned their pledge not to return to the traditional practice of negotiating a budget among the three of them, with minimal input from rank-and-file legislators.
This year's budget is already the second-latest in state history, at 108 days overdue as of Saturday. If there are any snags, it could break the record set two years ago, when the final budget bills were not passed until Aug. 4, 126 days late.
Mr. Pataki appears to have achieved one of his two primary goals for this budget: the state's $1.8 billion surplus from the fiscal year that ended March 31 will be saved, not spent, to insure that the state will have enough money to absorb tax cuts that are already in law, and ones that are to go into effect over the next few years.
It is unclear whether he reached his other goal, to keep the spending increase under the rate of inflation. It is an important claim for a man who would like the national Republican Party to consider him for the Vice President's spot on next year's ticket, and is trying to reassert his credentials as a fiscal conservative, after last year's 6 percent overall spending increase.
In January, Mr. Pataki called for a 1.8 percent increase. Officials are saying the budget outline that the leaders have agreed to raises spending by more than 3 percent.
But state lawmakers routinely overestimate expenses when drafting budgets, so the true figures will not be known until the fiscal year ends next spring. Last fiscal year, the state spent $800 million less than was predicted by the enacted budget; the year before, it spent $1.1 billion less.
Mr. Silver and the Democrats have reportedly salvaged, for the next year, one of their prized programs, the state's year-old investment in prekindergarten classes, all-day kindergarten and lower class sizes in the early grades. Mr. Pataki had proposed eliminating the program and replacing it with a less expensive block grant that districts could spend as they pleased.
But the future of the program remains murky beyond this fiscal year, officials said, with the Governor unwilling to lock it into law permanently. The 1997 agreement that created it called for implementation in stages, with spending rising from more than $300 million over the next year, to $1.4 billion in a few years.
The state will probably increase aid to school districts by about the same amount as last year's record increase of more than $800 million, or more than 6 percent, officials said.
Early this year, Mr. Pataki proposed new Medicaid cuts, while Mr. Silver proposed undoing cuts made to the program in 1995 and 1996. Both demands were seen as bargaining positions, and both have been abandoned, officials said, though many thorny details must still be resolved. The 1995 and 1996 cuts, which expired on July 1, will be reinstated, officials said, but the state and local governments may not be reimbursed for the money they lost as a result for a three-month period.
The biggest victor is Mr. Bruno, who will apparently get a final budget that will look very much like the one his Republican majority proposed in March. The overall spending figure, the amount of education aid and the handling of Medicaid will all be very nearly what he had called for. And throughout the budget talks, it was Mr. Bruno who acted as the arbiter, maintaining good relations with both the Governor and the Speaker.
But officials said it remains to be seen what becomes of the tax cuts, particularly those for businesses, which the Senate leader sought.
The leaders have agreed to sell the state's malpractice insurance pool for doctors to a private insurance company, which officials said could raise about $250 million, but it was not clear tonight how the money would be spent.

HEADLINE: CONNECTICUT CASE FAVORS MICROSOFT

BYLINE: BySTEVE LOHR 

 BODY:
It was a David versus Goliath case, a courtroom confrontation between a struggling little software maker and the mighty Microsoft Corporation.
Microsoft was accused of befriending the fledgling company when it suited its interests and then callously casting the company aside when it was no longer useful, denying it access to Microsoft's technology on fair terms. The tactic, the plaintiff's lawyers argued, was a violation of Federal antitrust laws and all but a death sentence for Bristol Technology Inc. of Danbury, Conn. 
Yet yesterday, as an uptick in Microsoft's stock price lifted the personal wealth of William H. Gates to nearly $100 billion, a Connecticut jury of five men and three women, ranging in age from 21 to the late 60's, whose job status ran the gamut from unemployed to corporate executive, sided with Goliath.
The jury in Federal District Court in Bridgeport, Conn., found that Microsoft had not violated antitrust laws in its dealings with Bristol.
The private suit in Connecticut has no direct impact on the major antitrust challenge Microsoft faces -- the Federal case brought by the Justice Department and 19 states. The charges and evidence are different.
But antitrust experts said yesterday's verdict would certainly hearten the Microsoft legal team in Washington. Despite the differences, Microsoft has been portrayed in both cases as an overreaching monopolist that used its market power as a club -- a characterization supported by piles of Microsoft E-mail and internal documents that spoke forcefully of destroying rivals and leaning on partners.
"This is a decisive triumph for Microsoft, and it has to be a shot of adrenaline for the Microsoft lawyers working on the Government case," said William Kovacic, a professor at the George Washington University law school. "This verdict may not have any direct effect on the Government case, but it shows Microsoft that it can win these cases, even when much of the evidence in court is unflattering."
In celebrating their victory, the Microsoft lawyers certainly echoed the same themes of the company's defense in the Government case -- that its business practices are merely the rough-and-tumble of modern capitalism, and that the computer software market moves so rapidly that Microsoft can scarecly be considered an entrenched monopolist.
"The considered opinion of the community in which Bristol operates is that Microsoft did nothing wrong," said David Tulchin, a partner at Sullivan & Cromwell who was Microsoft's lead trial lawyer. "All that Microsoft did was compete hard."
Steve Aeschbacher, a senior corporate lawyer at Microsoft, said that the verdict strongly suggested that the jury was "impressed by all the evidence in the record of the intensity and dynamism of competition in the software industry."
The verdict, legal experts say, may help Microsoft avoid a wave of private antitrust suits in the future, by giving potential plaintiffs second thoughts. A trial is expected to start early next year in a private antitrust suit against Microsoft in Utah, filed by Caldera Inc. Two other private antitrust suits have been filed, one in California and one in Texas, though no trials are scheduled.
Bristol had sought a stiff financial penalty against Microsoft -- damages ranging from $130 million to $263 million, which, if Microsoft was found to violate antitrust laws, would have been tripled.
The jury did find that Microsoft had violated a Connecicut law prohibiting "deceptive practices," like making misleading statements to a business partner. But for that unspecificed transgression, the jury awarded Bristol $1.
"That's not even a parking ticket," observed Mr. Kovacic of George Washington University.
Not even that for Microsoft, which has nearly $22 billion in cash on hand, according to its most recent financial statement.
Bristol said it was disappointed by the outcome and that it was exploring the option of appealing. "We still firmly believe that Microsoft engaged in anticompetitive behavior against Bristol," said Keith Blackwell, Bristol's chief executive.
Patrick Lynch, a partner at O'Melveny & Myers and lead counsel for Bristol, said: "This is a case of great importance to the entire computer industry. While the ruling is disappointing to Bristol, this is an issue that is not going to go away. Microsoft's abuse of its dominant position has to be addressed."
Still, antitrust experts say the Bristol suit was a high-risk legal case from the outset. First, they say, the case focused on the software markets for computer work stations and so-called server computers, which feed data out to desktop machines in computer networks. In those markets, Microsoft is not nearly as dominant as it is in the market for desktop operating systems for personal computers, where its Windows software runs more than 90 percent of PC's sold.
Second, antitrust experts note that Bristol relied on the theory that Microsoft had a "duty to deal" with Bristol. And the experts point out that duty-to-deal cases, which regard the plaintiff almost as a regulated utility, have been difficult to win in recent years. The main exceptions, they note, have been in industries with traditions of regulation, like telecommunications, or businesses involving natural assets, like ski slopes.
Significantly, for its sweeping antitrust case, the Government did depose Mr. Blackwell of Bristol. But the Justice Department chose to focus instead on Microsoft's use of its market power derived from its dominance of the PC operating system market. The Government has charged that the company used its Windows monopoly to stifle competition from the rise of Internet software. And the Government also steered clear of any duty-to-deal claims.
"Bristol chose to bring a case in one of the most prodefendant areas of antitrust," said Robert E. Hall, an economist at Stanford University. "Courts have been very reluctant to say that companies must share their intellectual property."
Bristol makes software that allows programs written for Microsoft's Windows to run on work stations or servers that use Unix, an industrial-strength operating system popular among corporate users. In 1994, when Microsoft was still having trouble cracking into the market for corporate computing, it signed a three-year licensing deal with Bristol. It allowed Bristol broad access to Microsoft's Windows technology.
But three years later, when Microsoft's own powerful operating system, Windows NT, was making strong inroads into the corporate market, the deal offered to Bristol was very different. Microsoft wanted corporate customers to switch from Unix to Windows NT, and Bristol said that its "translation" software -- once an asset for Microsoft -- was now seen by Microsoft as a potential impediment to the migration of customers to Windows NT.
So when renegotiating the contract, Microsoft offered Bristol a new license, but at four times the price and with far less access to Microsoft technology. "Microsoft's dealings with Bristol are a classic bait-and-switch," Mr. Lynch, Bristol's lawyer, said before the trial began in June.
Microsoft did not deny that its license terms had changed, but it explained that was because the market conditions changed. Besides, Microsoft says that another company, Mainsoft Inc., accepted the same terms that were offered to Bristol. Microsoft argued that Bristol was trying to elevate a garden-variety contract dispute into an antitrust case.
In 1997, Inc. magazine ranked Bristol 140th among the 500 fastest-growing companies in the nation, with a payroll of 70 people and estimated revenues of $8 million. But the failure to renew its Microsoft license has placed Bristol's future in doubt, and it has spent heavily on its suit.
"Bristol's mistake was that it chose to litigate instead of negotiate," said Mr. Aeschbacher of Microsoft.
The jury in Connecticut agreed.

HEADLINE: Gates Hits $100 Billion Mark, More or Less

BYLINE: By AMY HARMON 

 BODY:
Last month, in the largest gift ever by a living person to a charitable foundation, William H. Gates, the chairman of the Microsoft Corporation, donated $5 billion to support education and health care causes.
Yesterday, in a few hours of stock market trading, Mr. Gates's holdings surged by just about that amount, brushing $100 billion for the first time. 
 The mixture of awe and dismay that has long characterized America's fixation on Mr. Gates's personal wealth was perhaps best summed up yesterday by Vincent Malgapo, a contributor to the Silicon Investor electronic discussion forums: "Bill Gates MSFT stock worth $100 Billion right now!" read the comment, which was posted at 11:41 A.M. "WOW!"
Mr. Gates, who owns 19.8 percent, or about one billion shares, of the company he co-founded in 1975, owes his world record to the remarkable performance of Microsoft's stock. Shares of the software company climbed 5.4 percent yesterday to a record high of $99.4375, on expectations that it will establish a separate tracking stock for its Internet properties.
The company is the first to top $500 billion in market value. If it were a country it would have the ninth-largest economy in the world, behind Spain, which has a gross domestic product of $553 billion.
But the ballooning of Microsoft's stock price simply does not hold the same fascination as that of its chairman's brokerage account.
"He finally did it," said Paul Saffo, director of the Institute for the Future in Menlo Park, Calif. "This is what we've all been waiting for. How much interest do you suppose it generates? I bet it's a 747 per day."
Philip Greenspun, creator of the Bill Gates Personal Wealth Clock, a Web site that continuously calculates the value of Mr. Gates's Microsoft stock, had a more pointed speculation.
"Maybe this will convince my students they shouldn't work so hard to become rich," said Mr. Greenspun, a researcher at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's laboratory for computer science. "Because they're probably not going to be richer than Bill Gates, so they might as well do something interesting and valuable to society instead."
At a time of sustained economic prosperity, America's proclivity to celebrate wealth is reflected in the high marks Mr. Gates still receives in national opinion polls. And the 43-year-old executive, who lives in a $60 million mansion on the shores of Lake Washington with his wife and two children, has recently begun to contribute more to philanthropy.
But the $100 billion mark may also mark a change in popular perception.
"Gates has crossed a psychological marker and it's going to increase pressure on him to recycle more and more of that money through his foundations," said Ron Chernow, an economic historian. "There will be more attention focused on the extraordinarily lopsided distribution of wealth."
Of course, Mr. Gates is not the only software entrepreneur to become fabulously wealthy in recent years. Microsoft's co-founder, Paul Allen, and its chief executive, Steve Ballmer, are among the world's five richest people, along with the investor Warren E. Buffett, whose 39.9 percent stake in the investment holding company Berkshire Hathaway Inc. is valued at about $42.5 billion, making him second to Mr. Gates.
Dozens of founders of fledgling Internet companies have become worth millions on paper in a matter of months.
And by some calculations, Mr. Gates is poorer than John D. Rockefeller, who had in excess of 2 percent of the gross national product at the peak of his wealth in 1913.
Still, it may not be long before Mr. Gates passes another milestone.
"The key is when he reaches a trillion," said Lewis D'vorkin, an executive editor at Forbes magazine, which publishes an annual list of the world's 400 richest people. "If Microsoft share price grows in the next five years as fast as it has in the last five, he hits the big one in 2004."

HEADLINE: Newspaper Columnist Suspended for Buying Stock Through Friend

BYLINE: By FELICITY BARRINGER 

 BODY:
A San Jose Mercury News business columnist was suspended indefinitely yesterday for taking advantage of a friend's offer to buy shares of a fledgling company at a price not available to the general public.
The columnist, Chris Nolan, told one of her editors about the offer before she bought 500 shares of Autoweb.com at the initial offering price of $14, but he offered no explicit approval or disapproval, according to Ms. Nolan. The columnist, whose "Talk Is Cheap" column focuses on the gossip of Silicon Valley's high-technology businesses, said she made about $9,000 by selling her stock within the first two days after Autoweb.com first offered stock for sale to the public in March. 
 David Yarnold, the executive editor of the Mercury News, said yesterday that he felt "she clearly placed us in a situation where the public could perceive the Mercury News to have a conflict of interest."
The newspaper's ethics policy forbids staff writers to make news decisions about companies in which they have a financial interest. It also stipulates that business writers should not invest in local businesses.
Ms. Nolan's situation, which was first reported in The Wall Street Journal, reflects the way the culture of quick profits from initial stock offerings has become a routine part of Silicon Valley life. It also shows the value of being invited to buy stock at the offering price.
What has not changed, however, are newspaper and newsmagazine ethics policies. They remain strict in forbidding business reporters and editors from having any financial stake in the companies they cover.
Ms. Nolan's case troubles some because she did seek her editors' guidance and permission. Ms. Nolan said in an interview that the chief executive of Autoweb.com, Dean DeBiase, "has been a friend for many years" and that "I felt this was an offer from a friend."
Ms. Nolan is a member of the local chapter of the Newspaper Guild, and a union executive confirmed that he is investigating the situation.
Ms. Nolan also said yesterday that she had also sold Fortune magazine a first-person account of her experience with Autoweb.com -- a freelance arrangement that she said her editors had approved. Mr. Yarnold said last night that while Ms. Nolan had mentioned the article to editors "in a passing way," she "did not have affirmative permission to submit the article to Fortune."
While some colleagues said there was some sentiment among reporters that the editor's reactions were overly harsh, the one reporter who spoke on the record, the economics correspondent Jonathan Rabinovitz, said: "I like Chris. I think Chris is a great reporter. But you don't do that. It's that simple."

HEADLINE: MOST IN H.M.O.'S WOULDN'T BENEFIT FROM SENATE BILL

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 16

 BODY:
Despite all the talk about protecting people in health maintenance organizations, most people in H.M.O.'s would gain no tangible benefit from many of the consumer-protection standards approved by the Senate this week as part of a bill to define patients' rights, lawyers and health policy experts said.
Many of the bill's basic consumer protections would apply to 48 million people in group health plans regulated by the Federal Government. Few H.M.O.'s are in that category, according to data published recently in the journal Health Affairs. 
 Most of the 48 million people, it appears, get their health care through traditional fee-for-service arrangements or through loosely organized forms of managed care that are less restrictive than the H.M.O.'s whose decisions about care have angered many consumers.
Even the application of the measure to those 48 million is in doubt because President Clinton has said he would veto the measure, many aspects of which remained unclear until today, because a substitute was put forward at the last minute.
In four days of debate before the final vote on Thursday, Republican senators said repeatedly that they did not want to usurp the states' authority to regulate insurance. In general, they said, they wanted to set Federal standards for health plans that could not be regulated by the states -- "self-insured" health plans established by employers for their employees.
The study in Health Affairs, by two economists at the Rand Corporation, Susan Marquis and Stephen H. Long, finds that only 2 percent of employers offer H.M.O.'s that would be covered by these standards in the Senate bill. And only 9 percent of employees are in such H.M.O.'s, they said.
Craig Copeland, a research associate at the Employee Benefit Research Institute, a nonpartisan organization, said today that "only a small number of the 48 million people are in H.M.O.'s -- at most 10 percent."
In a "self-insured" health plan, the employer insures itself, bearing the financial risk for its employees' medical costs and often paying the claims out of the assets of the business. By contrast, most H.M.O.'s bear the financial risk for their members. In return for fixed monthly premiums, the H.M.O.'s promise to provide whatever care is needed and covered under the insurance contract.
Prof. Timothy S. Jost of Ohio State University, the co-author of a treatise on health law, said, "Usually if a plan is an H.M.O. operation, it would be fully insured and therefore exempt" from many standards in the Senate bill.
An H.M.O. is one type of managed care. In other forms of managed care, patients may receive a discount if they use certain doctors and hospitals, but they are not required to do so. Republicans said that many people in these managed-care plans would gain protection from the Senate-passed bill.
But there have been fewer complaints about these plans because they are less restrictive and generally do not require patients to get permission to see a specialist or to go outside the network of doctors recommended by the health plan.
Democratic senators often complained that the Republican bill was a sham, but it was impossible to evaluate those assertions until the full text of the legislation became available on Thursday night. The Senate Republican leader, Trent Lott of Mississippi, offered the substitute several hours before the final vote, and that substitute was the measure passed by a final vote of 53 to 47.
As lawmakers sorted through the legislation today, one thing seemed clear. If the bill becomes law, patients could not immediately be sure of their rights, and some employers could not be sure of their obligations, because those rights and duties depend on the details and structure of a person's health insurance plan.
Employees working side by side could thus have different rights and remedies, depending on whether they were in an H.M.O., a traditional insurance plan or some hybrid.
Under the Senate Republican bill, all group health plans would have to have procedures so patients could obtain "an independent external review" of decisions to deny coverage on the ground that a particular service was medically unnecessary or experimental.
At least 18 states already require such appeal procedures, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Adrienne Hahn, legislative counsel for Consumers Union, said the Senate bill would supersede the state laws, including some that provide patients with more protection.
Senate Republican aides said they did not know if the bill would pre-empt state laws that give patients more extensive appeal rights. And the bill itself does not say.
Several miscellaneous provisions of the bill, largely overlooked in the debate on Thursday night, drew sharp criticism from Democrats today.
One provision would kill an experimental program for H.M.O.'s in Phoenix. The demonstration project would encourage price competition among H.M.O.'s by requiring them to bid for the privilege of serving Medicare beneficiaries.
Senator Jon Kyl, Republican of Arizona, joined H.M.O.'s in opposing the project, which they said would disrupt the local insurance market. But Senator Bob Graham, Democrat of Florida, said it was outrageous to block a program that sought to use the free market to save money for taxpayers and for the Medicare program.
"The language to destroy this pilot project was buried in a 250-page bill, and nobody was given an opportunity to read it," Mr. Graham said today.
The effort to define patients' rights takes Congress into a legal swamp that surrounds a landmark 1974 law, the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, known as Erisa. The law, which governs health plans covering 125 million Americans, has been described by the Supreme Court as "an enormously complex and detailed statute."
A major purpose of the law was to establish uniform Federal standards for health and pension plans, on the theory that employers would be deterred from providing such benefits if they had to comply with conflicting state laws.
Many provisions of the Senate-passed bill are framed as amendments to Erisa. But it is difficult to know for sure who would be protected under provisions of the bill that would, for example, guarantee access to emergency care, obstetricians and other medical specialists.
Each of these standards applies, in the words of the bill, to "a group health plan (other than a fully insured group health plan)."
Other standards, which establish procedures for patients to appeal a denial of coverage, apply to "every employee benefit plan." Still other standards apply to "a group health plan" or an insurance company that offers coverage in connection with a group health plan.
Sheldon Weinhaus, a St. Louis lawyer who often represents patients, said these provisions of the bill were "an invitation to mischief." Mr. Weinhaus said, "No one really knows, with any precision, what is meant by the terms 'self-insured' and 'fully insured.' " Employers and insurers often share the risk of paying for catastrophic medical expenses, he added.
One of the stronger provisions in the Senate bill would require all health plans to pay for overnight hospital stays after breast cancer treatments, including mastectomy, if a woman and her doctor agreed that such a stay was "medically necessary and appropriate."
Unlike many other provisions, this one would cover anyone with private health insurance.

HEADLINE: What Price the Most Expensive Diamond of All?

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY EGAN 

DATELINE: SEATTLE, July 16

 BODY:
Safeco Field, the most costly single-sport stadium in North America, opened for Major League Baseball on Thursday night, a $517 million expanse of art and green grass cradled by the marine air of Puget Sound and the hopes of fans long blanketed in misery. But what was once heralded as a grand local celebration of the national pastime is now soured by protests, legal threats and a growing squall over how much the public should pay for stadiums that enrich private owners.
The focus of the battle here is the Seattle Mariners' ownership group. The owners, who include Microsoft billionaires, promised to cover all cost overruns on the new park but have now stunned even the team's strongest allies by asking for tax dollars to pay for most of an overrun totaling $100 million, on top of $372 million that taxpayers have already contributed to the stadium's cost. 
 Elsewhere, team owners including Ross Perot Jr., who is using tax money to build an arena for his Dallas Mavericks basketball team, and George W. Bush, who saw the value of his stake in baseball's Texas Rangers rise to $15 million from $600,000 after the public financed a new stadium for the club, have figured in a debate that entwines the emotional threads of sports with the strands of politics.
"I think the public is at its limit," said Thomas M. Finneran, the Speaker of the Massachusetts House of Representatives, who led the fight to curb the amount his state would pay to keep the New England Patriots. The team is staying in Foxboro, Mass., with the help of $70 million in state road improvements, after backing out of a $375 million stadium deal with Connecticut.
"Our hearts are with the home team," Mr. Finneran said. "But more and more, people are saying enough of this kind of corporate welfare. And I think the sports owners asked for the backlash," by making exorbitant demands.
The new home of the Mariners, with its Internet kiosks, views of the Olympic Mountains and signature sculptures of baseball symbols, has been hailed by fans and design critics alike as a wondrous addition to Seattle. The 47,000-seat stadium -- which replaces the drab, 23-year-old Kingdome -- has a retractable roof, grass that can be automatically heated to bring it out of its dormancy in the spring and, hanging in a rotunda behind home plate, a chandelier of 1,000 translucent bats. Without the new stadium and the additional revenue that is expected as a result, it is unlikely that baseball could have remained in the city, said Bud Selig, the baseball commissioner.
But Safeco Field also has the distinction of being the first ball yard built with public money after voters said no to paying for it. It is a kind of dubious forerunner to stadiums that are scheduled to open in Milwaukee next year and in Pittsburgh in 2001, each built with tax dollars despite overwhelming, though nonbinding, votes against using taxes for them.
In Pennsylvania, what started as an effort to give one team, the Pittsburgh Pirates, a new stadium to keep it from leaving one of baseball's oldest venues ended up this year in the state's approval of public financing for a new home for each of four teams -- two in Pittsburgh, two in Philadelphia. The four stadiums will cost about $1 billion, at least two-thirds of which will be public money.
"Pennsylvania is a major league state, and we proved it today," Gov. Tom Ridge, a second-term Republican, said after guiding the stadium financing package through the Legislature.
But many others were outraged, particularly in the Philadelphia region, which had not been given a chance to vote on spending local tax dollars for new stadiums, and in Pittsburgh, which had been given the chance and rejected the idea.
"It boils down to politicians' giving more money to certain special interests that outweigh whatever voters may say," said Jake Haulk, director of the Allegheny Institute, a conservative public-policy organization in Pittsburgh. "They used to justify this on the grounds that these new stadiums were great economic generators, but they have abandoned that line. Now they just say, 'We need to be a world-class city, and taxpayers will have to pay for it.' "
At least 15 major sports complexes around the country are to open in the next three years, all but one, in San Francisco, financed by the public. Through the 1990's, nearly $11 billion in public money has been spent building and renovating sports centers.
In New York, both the Yankees and the Mets have asked the public to underwrite new baseball parks for them, although it appears that the Yankees will now most likely stay put in 76-year-old Yankee Stadium if $189 million in renovations are made in and around it.
Prompted by the runaway stadium plans of his home state, Senator Arlen Specter, Republican of Pennsylvania, has introduced a bill that would require Major League Baseball and the National Football League to pay at least 50 percent of the construction costs of new stadiums for their teams. For parks already being built, the owners are generally paying 10 to 30 percent, with the lone exception of San Francisco, where the Giants are privately financing the entire cost of $255 million Pacific Bell Park.
Senator Specter's bill has bipartisan support on the Senate Judiciary Committee but is strongly opposed by baseball and football owners, and other senators say it has only a slim chance of winning passage.
But a revolt of sorts is under way in a number of states. Gov. Jesse Ventura of Minnesota, for instance, has drawn a line against state financing of a new stadium for the Minnesota Twins despite ownership's repeated threats to move the team.
"No pushing things down people's throats," said Mr. Ventura, who last month set up a fund for Minnesotans who want to apply their state tax rebate toward construction of a new stadium. "This will be the state's contribution," the Governor said. "It's called put your money where your mouth is."
And in May, Arizona voters turned down a request by the owners of the Cardinals to finance a new football stadium. The vote followed by a year the opening of a $354 million stadium in Phoenix for baseball's Diamondbacks, a park financed largely by a sales tax increase.
The economics of major league sports, in which even mediocre players demand long-term contracts of $50 million or more, is largely behind the need for new stadiums and their revenue-enhancing features, like luxury boxes, corporate suites and innovative, interesting designs that can swell attendance.
"Could owners build and pay for their own stadiums?" said Allen Sanderson, a professor of economics at the University of Chicago who has written extensively about sports financing. "Yes, of course they could. But then they would make less money. So they go to the public instead."
In 1995, Seattle's voters narrowly turned down a proposal to raise the sales tax to build a new home for the Mariners. But later that year the team went on a magical run, coming from 13 games out of first place late in the season to win the division title and then beating the Yankees in the first round of the playoffs. A fan frenzy and the Mariners' demand for a new stadium prompted an emergency session of the Legislature, which gave the green light to a new taxing proposal. That proposal then went not to the voters but to the governing King County Council, which approved it.
The team's owners, a consortium of 16 members whose wealth is drawn largely from local high-technology enterprises and the Japanese-owned Nintendo Company, agreed to pay $45 million toward the new stadium -- most of which they raised by selling to the Safeco Corporation the right to name the park -- plus any cost overruns.
The owners say they have been losing more than $10 million a year, and with the prospect of $20 million in new annual revenue generated by Safeco Field, they ordered it rushed to completion. Then, just three weeks before it opened, they declared that tax dollars should be used to pay at least $60 million of the $100 million overrun. They are threatening suit for that amount against the Public Facilities District, the public agency that owns the stadium.
Political and business leaders who supported the team are furious. "I think all the unmitigated gall on the face of the earth right now resides at Mariner headquarters," said Cynthia Sullivan, a member of the King County Council.
Although they earlier promised to cover overruns, the team's owners say a close legal reading of the stadium financing contract supports their claim for additional public money. They have refused to respond in detail to questions about their position.
"I realize there are a lot of people who don't agree with us," said Howard Lincoln, a Mariner director who is chairman of Nintendo of America. "But even baseball owners are entitled to their day in court."
The baseball commissioner, Mr. Selig -- whose family, owner of the Milwaukee Brewers, is getting its own publicly financed stadium next year -- praised the Mariner owners, saying they were "heroes" who had lost $80 million since they bought the team seven years ago. "To me, they are the people that saved baseball in Seattle," Mr. Selig said. "Without them, there's no team here."
On Thursday night, protesters marched outside the Mariners' inaugural game at Safeco Field, holding signs reading, "No More Corporate Welfare" and "Keep Your Word."
Gov. Gary Locke offered advice to fans who feel conflicted. "It is not a contradiction," he said, "to say we love this stadium, and it's gorgeous and going to make people of the Pacific Northwest love baseball, but still insist that a contract is a contract, a deal is a deal."

HEADLINE: In Iowa, Clinton Makes Case for School Spending

BYLINE: By MELINDA HENNEBERGER 

DATELINE: DES MOINES, July 16

 BODY:
President Clinton today pitched his $24.8 billion plan to modernize 6,000 schools, saying students could not do their best work in buildings "where kids walk up the steps and they see broken windows every day, where there are rooms, in some cases whole floors they can't even go on."
He also commiserated with Iowa's small farmers who have been hit hard by crop prices that have fallen below the cost of production in some cases. 
 Joking that he was the only noncandidate Iowans had seen in weeks, Mr. Clinton spoke in a newly refurbished, but sweltering, gymnasium at Amos Hiatt Middle School, a 74-year-old building where recent repairs were paid for through an $18 million Federal demonstration project. A line about how some schools do not even have working heating and air-conditioning systems got a huge laugh.
Mr. Clinton tied the need for school construction, through interest-free bonds, to the broader debate about how to spend the budget surplus.
"I believe before we pass a big tax cut we should save Social Security and Medicare and add a prescription drug benefit to Medicare," the President said.
But the outlook for Mr. Clinton's proposal in Congress is uncertain. It was defeated as an amendment to a tax bill this week in the House Ways and Means Committee.
"This is a time of confidence and pride," Mr. Clinton said of the current economic boom. "But the time to fix the roof is when the sun is shining, and that is literally true in the case of school construction."
These are not boom times in Iowa, though, and Mr. Clinton acknowledged that farmers were among those who have not shared the wealth.
Only a day earlier, he was criticized by George W. Bush, the Texas Governor and Republican Presidential contender, for ignoring the plight of farmers during his cross-country tour last week to highlight pockets of poverty.
Today, Mr. Clinton said, "The big problem on the farm is we've had four years in a row of worldwide record harvest for the first time in history, and an economic collapse in 1997 in Asia, so markets shrink, the products go, prices collapse."
At that point a woman in the crowd shouted, "Freedom to Farm!" referring to the Freedom to Farm Act, a 1996 law that phased out most direct crop subsidies and encouraged high production at a time when the Asian financial crisis had limited the buying power of overseas customers.
After the speech, Bill Sherman, a local lobbyist for the teachers union, said the farm crisis had, among other things, made it much harder to pass bond issues for school construction. "Until farmers can make a decent living, it will be very difficult to get decent facilities, especially in rural areas," Mr. Sherman said.
Later in the afternoon, Mr. Clinton had a closed meeting with a group of farmers who planned to talk to him about the importance of pushing for changes in the Freedom to Farm law, with the soft prices and bumper crops causing a repeat of the farm crisis in the 1980's, but with much less national attention.
Mr. Clinton was also to appear at two evening fund-raisers for Senator Tom Harkin, who said in an interview after his school speech that it was important for the President to come to Iowa to hear about the farm crisis firsthand. "This is the worst I've seen," he said. "It's worse now than in the mid-80's."
A recent report by the Agriculture Department projected the average prices for corn and soybean for this year at about half the prices of only a few seasons ago.
With commodity prices falling below production costs, Mr. Harkin said, an aid package for struggling grain farmers and livestock producers was desperately needed. "Every day we wait is going to cost us more," he said.

HEADLINE: In Newark, a Carnival as Bears Return, With Bats

BYLINE: By RONALD SMOTHERS 

DATELINE: NEWARK, July 16

 BODY:
This city, which has been furiously reimagining itself in recent years as performing arts center and a transportation hub, donned a baseball uniform today with the opening of Riverfront Park stadium and the return of minor-league baseball to Newark after a 50-year absence.
The 6,000-seat, $34 million stadium, financed by the city and Essex County, will be the home of the Newark Bears. The name is drawn from the Triple-A New York Yankees farm team that won two dozen divisional and league championships and three minor-league equivalents of the World Series in an earlier era. And the Yankee imagery dominated today as the Bears' owner, Rick Cerone, a former Yankee catcher who grew up in Newark, brought in the legendary Yankees Yogi Berra and Phil Rizzuto for the opening ceremonies. 
 Calling the stadium the "House That Rick Built," the master of ceremonies had county and city elected officials line up along the first base line. Clowns, a costumed stilt walker, bagpipers and some Bears players circulated among the sellout crowd. A video about the old Newark Bears and the city's Newark Eagles of the Negro leagues played on a giant scoreboard screen.
"It's a carnival atmosphere and that's what it should be," said Mr. Cerone, speaking to reporters before the game while self-consciously twisting the huge World Series ring on his left hand.
The Bears -- in violet shirts, white pants and white and violet caps -- took the field for the first time to the pulsing beat of rock music, ready to face the Lehigh Valley Black Diamonds.
In the stands, spectators' expectations varied.
Larry Goldman, the president of the nearby New Jersey Performing Arts Center, whose opening 18 months ago heralded an important beginning to the city's revitalization, said that "arts and sports, sports and arts would prove to be the leading edge of change in urban areas." He cited examples in Pittsburgh, Dallas, Cleveland and Baltimore.
For Diana Hawks, a longtime Newark resident, it was "someplace to take the grandchildren."
Isaias Vasquez, 10, attending his first pro baseball game, was in search of memories. Looking around the stadium and pronouncing it "beautiful," he said, "I just want to get hit by a ball."
Situated on seven acres near the Passaic River that once housed iron foundries, carriage works and a dairy, Riverfront is the stadium that almost wasn't built.
Two years ago, just two weeks before city and county officials were to break ground on county parkland about a mile away, neighborhood opponents of the plan obtained landmarks designation for the park and blocked construction.
The Essex County Improvement Authority, the designated builder, had to shift gears, revise the financing plans, find a new site, negotiate to buy land from private owners and deal with new construction realities. The changes pushed the costs 50 percent over initial estimates.
Even as work started, skepticism remained, Mr. Cerone said. From January to June, Mr. Cerone said, the team got no calls from advertisers seeking space on the scoreboard or outfield fences or takers for its luxury sky boxes. Most thought work would never be finished by today, he said, adding: "But once the light towers went up last month and the sod went down, they started calling. Now we have a waiting list for everything, including promotions for our 36 home games."
All last winter and spring, the contractor played "beat the clock," said Harris Levy, the construction manager for the project with Prismatic Development Corporation. Today, still looking much like a construction site with trailers clogging dusty flats, and some cement walkways cordoned off and still drying, the stadium was pronounced "fan ready" by Mr. Levy.
Members of the six-team, independent Atlantic League, the Newark Bears are part of a boom in minor-league baseball that experts say is being fed by the same promise of economic development that comes with having a major league team and stadium. There are five independent leagues, unaffiliated with major-league teams or their farm systems, with 48 teams.
Alan Simpson, editor of Baseball Today, the trade publication that focuses on minor-league baseball, said the teams of the Atlantic League are an aggressive bunch who are paying more than some other leagues in an effort to get good players and who seem to have a flair for the marketing necessary to build fan interest and profits.
Last year, in their first year of operation and playing home games at Bridgeport and Skylands Park in far west Sussex County, the Bears came in last with a record of 17-33.
Team manager Tom O'Malley said that "feeling like nomads" may have accounted for the dismal record. After an equally dismal first half this season, the team started the second half with a 1-2 record. But tonight, the Bears gave the fans a thriller, winning 9-8 in 10 innings.

HEADLINE: Pension Fund Increases Property Purchases

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: SACRAMENTO, Calif., July 16

 BODY:
The largest United States public pension plan said this week that it had bought more than $1 billion in real estate assets in the last six months, with half of the purchases coming in California.
The pension plan, the California Public Employees' Retirement System, known as Calpers, which has overseas assets of more than $155 billion, said it was taking advantage of low stock prices for real estate investment trusts, or REIT's, that have caused the trusts to sell off properties. 
 Calpers said it began buying the properties when analysts carrying out a market review noticed that acquisitions by REIT's were down.
Unable to use stock to raise more capital and unwilling to take on new debt, the trusts began cutting back and selling off assets, according to Guy Jaquier, senior investment officer at Calpers.
Calpers said it had taken a cautious approach: About 40 percent of the real estate includes grocery-anchored retail centers and industrial buildings, properties better able to withstand economic downturns, a spokesman, Brad Pacheco, said.
The buying activity comes after a two-year review of the pension fund's real estate. Of its 41 new purchases, 21 are in California.

CORRECTION-DATE: July 31, 1999, Saturday

 CORRECTION:
A brief report in Business Day on July 17 about recent purchases of real estate assets by the California Public Employees' Retirement System referred to the pension fund's investment portfolio incorrectly. The fund oversees total assets in excess of $155 billion; its overseas assets are about 23 percent of that.

SPINOZA
 A Life.
 By Steven Nadler.
 Illustrated. 407 pp. New York:
 Cambridge University Press. $34.95. 
 "The noblest and most lovable of the great philosophers" is what Bertrand Russell called Spinoza in "History of Western Philosophy." Russell was quirky in his selection of heroes and villains, but in this case it is hard to disagree with him. Spinoza, a Dutch Jewish thinker of the 17th century, not only preached a philosophy of tolerance and benevolence but actually succeeded in living it. He was reviled in his own day and long afterward for his supposed atheism, yet even his enemies were forced to admit that he lived a saintly life. The worst anyone found to say about him, religious matters aside, was that he sometimes enjoyed watching spiders chase flies.
Last year, one biographer, Margaret Gullan-Whur (in "Within Reason: A Life of Spinoza"), devoted prodigious efforts to establishing that Spinoza's attitude toward women fell somewhat short of what one might expect from a late-20th-century college professor. In this she succeeded. It is also true that he smoked. But these shortcomings may perhaps be forgiven in a man whose philosophical vision was as powerful as any since Plato's.
Spinoza's life was relatively uneventful and its documentation hard to come by, so he has received little attention from biographers. Apart from the work of Gullan-Whur, who mainly sought to demonstrate that his philosophical attitudes were the product of a frustrated romance (which most experts believe never happened anyway), there seems to have been no biography of him in English since 1880. Steven Nadler, a professor of philosophy and a faculty member of the Center for Jewish Studies at the University of Wisconsin, Madison, has now admirably filled the gap with his meticulous, measured and highly readable "Spinoza: A Life."
Baruch Spinoza was born in 1632 into a community of former Marranos -- Jews who had for generations been obliged to live as Christians in their native Spain and Portugal. Much of their knowledge of Jewish law and tradition had been lost during the years when their ancestors had been forced to practice their religion in secret. Indeed, by the time they escaped to the relative freedom of the Netherlands, their earnest attempts to become good Jews were hampered by the fact that many of them had all but forgotten what this entailed. In effect, the Amsterdam Jews were new to Judaism and had all the zeal of recent converts. They were quick to condemn any of their number whose behavior seemed to threaten the recently regained faith. The intellectually inquisitive Spinoza soon aroused their ire. He was cursed and excommunicated, in the strongest language his synagogue could find, at the age of 23.
Spinoza spent the remaining 21 years of his short life writing and studying as a private scholar. A romantic myth -- still often repeated in textbooks and encyclopedias -- depicts him as a solitary soul who eked out a living as a lens grinder. In truth, he had many friends and survived on grants and pensions from them, though he kept his needs to a minimum. Nadler tells the tale of Spinoza's legacy from his friend Simon de Vries. De Vries, who was unmarried, wanted to make Spinoza his heir. Spinoza refused, since he thought this would be unfair to de Vries's brother. The philosopher could not stop de Vries from bestowing an annuity, but he did succeed in reducing the amount. As for lens grinding, this was primarily a scientific rather than a commercial enterprise. It was common in those days for a keen experimenter, as Spinoza was, to make his own optical instruments.
Many of Spinoza's friends in his not-so-solitary years of study were members of the various dissident Christian groups collectively known as Collegiants. These small sects, which were sometimes little more than discussion groups, typically rejected all religious ceremonies. They dismissed the authority of the established churches and many or even all traditional dogmas. Their religion focused on the morally uplifting effects of reading Scripture, the virtues of religious freedom and the desirability of an absolute separation between church and state. Despite his growing fame in philosophical and scientific circles -- Leibniz sought him out and the University of Heidelberg offered him a chair in philosophy, which he politely declined -- it was for his religious views, which chimed with those of the Collegiants, that Spinoza was primarily known.
As a spy-priest wrote to the Inquisition (which kept a close watch on Marranos abroad, in case they were in contact with former Jews at home), Spinoza held that "God exists only philosophically." What this meant, in effect, was that Spinoza's God was abstract and impersonal -- far too abstract and impersonal to be acceptable to orthodox Christianity or Judaism. When Spinoza's reputation eventually recovered from the stigma of atheism, it was the apparent identification of God with nature, presented in his posthumously published "Ethics," that most attracted attention. This picture meant many things to many people. Coleridge and Shelley saw in it a religion of nature. George Eliot, who translated some of the "Ethics" into English, liked Spinoza for his vehement attacks on superstition. Marx liked him for what he took to be his materialistic account of the universe. Goethe could not say exactly what it was that he liked in the "Ethics," but he knew he was profoundly moved by something or other.
Goethe was one of the few with the courage to admit that he could not really understand what Spinoza was on about most of the time. The "Ethics" is a work with many still-unresolved obscurities, a forbidding mathematical structure modeled on Euclid's geometry and a technical vocabulary derived in part from medieval scholasticism. Nadler wisely chooses to outline its conclusions and not delve any deeper.
It is puzzling that almost everyone who reads Spinoza reads the "Ethics" and not his earlier "Tractatus Theologico-Politicus." This work, published anonymously in Spinoza's lifetime, is easily comprehensible and, as Nadler notes, succeeds in explaining many of the most distinctive tenets of his philosophy. It is arguably the first major work of modern biblical criticism, one of the finest defenses of freedom of thought and a neglected masterpiece. It is certainly the first work of Spinoza's to which readers who have been introduced to him by this engaging biography should turn.

WALKER EVANS
 By James R. Mellow.
 Illustrated. 654 pp. New York:
 Basic Books. $40. 
 "I used to try to figure out precisely what I was seeing all the time, until I discovered I didn't need to. If the thing is there, why, there it is." This was how the photographer Walker Evans approached his art. The tone and content of his declaration encapsulate the astute but cryptic viewpoint with which Evans emerges in "Walker Evans," published posthumously by the fine cultural biographer James R. Mellow, who died in 1997. Evans comes across as possessed by a brave and all-encompassing vision; like his work, he was straightforward, decisive and highly intelligent. He is also shown to have been cold and dismissive, an almost frightening combination of the brazen and the unanalytical.
Evans photographed Manhattan construction sites, Tahitian beaches, workers in Havana, American neo-Gothic architecture, gas stations in West Virginia, barber shops in Mississippi, tenant farmers in Alabama, flood refugees in Arkansas, New York subway riders and a range of other subjects that documented American life, urban and rural, affluent and impoverished, starting in the mid-1920's. He made his best-known images in the Depression but continued taking pictures -- many of which appeared in Fortune magazine -- almost until his death in 1975 at the age of 71. He was one of the rare human souls perpetually open to seeing and able to push back the boundaries of what was acceptable. His scope was inclusive, but he was discriminating. Receptive to everything, he was also forever making judgments. The first photographer to have a solo retrospective at a major American museum -- his 1933 show at the Museum of Modern Art -- Evans created images that were visually and technically impeccable, and truly evocative of their myriad themes. Carl Van Vechten rightly declared that "if everything in American civilization were destroyed except Walker Evans's photographs, they could tell us a good deal about American life." Eleanor Roosevelt voiced much the same sentiment, writing in one of her My Day columns that Evans's work "shows us contemporary America, and I think all of us who care about our country will be deeply interested in this record."
What is harder to figure out is how Evans felt about the America and its inhabitants he captured. Regarding that issue, Mellow -- like Evans with his camera -- does not comment on his subject so much as focus carefully, present the information and let us come to our own conclusions.
Mellow zeroes in on the pictures and describes their achievement with both poignant accuracy and critical flair. Even when the work is not reproduced, it comes vividly to mind, with sharply elegant summations like "a photo of a decrepit Ford with a door off and a rubber tire missing, stationed like a pilgrimage shrine on a journey not completed." A picture that "shows a man and a woman clutching each other against some impending menace" in front of a "ravaged poster . . . plastered over with torn banners . . . taken in the early phases of the Great Depression . . . is an announcement of ephemerality: the ephemerality of the American Dream, of American advertising, of circuses and movies -- the whole host of disillusionments swept up by economic reality." How refreshing to read a commentator on art who evokes both what something looks like and, without malarkey, what it signifies.
And in his clear way Mellow conveys Evans's considerable complexity. He presents Evans and his art as exemplifying traits and effects summed up by the photographer's primary supporter -- the indefatigable editor, writer, curator and ballet impresario Lincoln Kirstein -- who mounted exhibitions of the work, wrote a pivotal book about it and brought it to the attention of the larger world. To Kirstein, Evans's work was provocative, the man frustrating. Kirstein was Evans's opposite in his intense emotional engagement and delicious loss of control as he delved beneath surfaces. In a prose style as personal as Evans's was objective, Kirstein wrote:
"Exerting a kind of small but concentrated animal magnetism, he somehow seemed to allow his small size to lead him into the exaggerations of a strutting compensation. . . . His jealousy or irritation manifests itself after the initial impulse by a long interval. His self-consciousness and localized egotism I found so difficult to put up with that I knew I must be affected pretty subjectively."
Mellow himself holds back on generalizations or conclusive statements evaluating either the work or its maker, but that jealousy and irritation -- indeed, a real nastiness -- come through in Evans's own voice. We have to assume that it was Mellow's intention to portray Evans as pitiless and even cruel -- even if those traits seem to be contradicted by his work. Consider Evans's assessment of the photographer Ralph Steiner: "Like all superior Jews, he has married an inferior Nordic who has pushed him in the wrong direction." Evans is no kinder about H. G. Wells, whom he calls "not a poet, not an artist, not an historian. Just a goddamn little socialist." His terseness and cynicism dominate a letter to a friend about Hart Crane's suicide in 1932: "Don't let this upset you. Crane a goner long ago, as you will remember." Evans is particularly chilling about Ben Shahn's wife, Tillie, when pregnant: "I dislike other men's wives in that condition." How strange when someone whose art would suggest humanity seems lacking in it.
Evans's harshness peaked in relation to his own family. Of a reunion with his mother's relatives, he wrote a friend: "I got an immediate impression of false teeth, dandruff, adenoids, varicose veins and halitosis of the eardrums. . . . How fatal it has been that all the women have ruled the men right out of their masculinity, independence, courage, will and at last, brains even." His bitterness knew no bounds; when divorcing his wife, Jane, Evans wrote her, "From now on I will consider you dead."
Was Walker Evans one of those people who could show sympathy only for anonymous strangers? Or was he, like many other highly intelligent people, simply unable to avoid twisting the knife? Mellow provides no answers here, but his apparently deliberate decision to follow Evans's example and present rather than comment seems the right one. After all, no adjectives Mellow might have mustered could be as telling as Evans's own remarks.
Of course we do not know what Mellow might have done if he had lived long enough to complete this book. Would he have given his own assessment of the man he researched so carefully but met only once -- on an occasion when Evans's alcoholism dominated their encounter? Would he have worked with his editor to clear up certain problems in the text -- the introduction of characters without adequate explanation of who they are; confusion about Evans's high school education in Toledo, Ohio, at the New England preparatory schools Loomis and Andover and at Mercersburg Academy in Philadelphia, with no precise elucidation of the sequence or why he attended all of them? Would Mellow have eliminated occasional inconsistencies, like the way he calls his subject Evans through most of the text but Walker for just a few pages? Or was that intentional, since the use of Walker coincides with what must be the photographer's most human moment in the entire text -- a rare display of emotion when Evans cries at the sight of Jane in an evening gown? These shortcomings aside, Augie Capaccio, Mellow's partner, and Don Fehr, his editor, are to be congratulated for producing this unfinished book and providing a chronology of the last 18 years of Evans's life; Mellow died before completing the final chapters.
The result includes fascinating cameos of some of the most imaginative, energetic and courageous forces in 20th-century American culture. The intersection of creative lives is forever exciting, and through Evans we encounter, among others, the poet Ezra Pound, the saloniste Muriel Draper, the painters Ben Shahn, Diego Rivera and Frida Kahlo, the critic Dwight Macdonald, the art critic Clement Greenberg, John Cheever as a struggling young book reviewer, the photographers Alfred Stieglitz, Berenice Abbott and Jay Leyda, the publisher Henry Luce and the writers Edmund Wilson and Ernest Hemingway (on whom Mellow is particularly adept). Looming larger are the ever-original Kirstein and Evans's brilliant collaborator on "Let Us Now Praise Famous Men," James Agee -- from whom Mellow provides judicious quotations that lead him to the marvelous conclusion, "Among hard-nosed social documentarians, Agee is a rank sensualist."
What makes these portraits fascinating is that Evans knew these people when they were hard-working, hard-living professionals, not icons. Sometimes we sense that he treated the people in his life the same way as the subjects of his photographs -- they were there, so there they were -- but even if Evans's sentiments were harsh or inaccessible, the scope of his lens was never in doubt.

Starting Out in the Evening
 By Brian Morton. Berkley, $12.95.
Leonard Schiller is an out-of-print novelist in his 70's whose intensely ordered life is shaken by the arrival of a young woman who wants to write a master's thesis on his work. Last year our reviewer, William H. Pritchard, called this a sad novel that nonetheless "works toward affirming and enhancing life. . . . As a piece of writing, it's nothing less than a triumph."
 
Cold New World: Growing Up in a Harder Country
 By William Finnegan. Modern Library, $14.95.
These four bleak portraits of young people left behind by America's bustling economy explore how and why they came to be drawn into lives ruled by drugs, crime, gangs and extremism. "The cumulative effect is to create an unusual kind of sympathy," Jack Hitt wrote here last year. "Finnegan convincingly connects the wayward events in these people's lives to the messages and forces they detect around them." A Hope in the Unseen: An American Odyssey From the Inner City to the Ivy League, by Ron Suskind (Broadway, $13), is a more optimistic dispatch, based on a Pulitzer Prize-winning series in The Wall Street Journal, that chronicles the struggle of a poor black teen-ager to lift himself from his blighted Washington high school into Brown University. In 1998 our reviewer, Sara Mosle, called this an "extraordinary, formula-shattering book."
 
Some Tame Gazelle
 By Barbara Pym. Moyer Bell, $11.95.
The author's first novel, originally published in Britain in 1950, is about two middle-aged sisters living in an English village: one is hopelessly in love with the local vicar; the other has a thing for young curates. In 1983 Michael Gorra, reviewing the first American edition here, said the story "has all the quiet skill, the tough, reasonable wit and . . . the calm integrity of Pym's best work."
 
Genuine Reality: A Life of William James
 By Linda Simon. University of Chicago, $18.
This biography of America's most famous philosopher (and the brother of Henry James) reveals how his ideas were linked to his own experiences, including his troubled relationship with his father, and how he spent a lifetime coping with severe depression. The author "vivifies William James in such a way that his life and thought come freshly alive for the modern reader," David S. Reynolds wrote here in 1998. In Alice James: A Biography, by Jean Strouse (Harvard University, $18.95), the youngest of the James siblings is shown to have been a formidable figure in her own right: even though mysterious illnesses rendered her an invalid for most of her life, she was a gifted, enigmatic woman whose intellectual powers intensified over time. In 1980 our reviewer, Diane Johnson, called this a "judicious and beautifully written biography."
 
Loves That Bind
 By Julin Rios. Vintage International, $12.
The narrator of this Spanish novel recounts his amorous exploits in a series of letters addressed to an unnamed lover who has abandoned him in London. Last year in these pages, Abigail Lee Six admired the author's "virtuoso use of language: multilingual puns, neologisms galore, dazzling networks of extended metaphor."
 
Will This Do?
The First Fifty Years of Auberon Waugh: An Autobiography
Carroll & Graf, $13.95.
The son of Evelyn Waugh recalls life with father, who not surprisingly was exasperating and extremely hard to please, as well as the rest of his childhood and his own literary travails. The result is "a modest but terrifically entertaining book that's funny, acerbic and a little sad," Michiko Kakutani wrote in The Times in 1998.
 
The Long Falling
 By Keith Ridgway. Mariner/Houghton Mifflin, $13.
The murder of an abusive husband by his long-suffering wife in rural Ireland is portrayed as an understandable act that raises a disturbing question: Is the taking of another's life ever justifiable? Last year our reviewer, Rosemary Mahoney, called this first novel skillfully drawn and "at times excruciatingly suspenseful."
 
Hullabaloo in the Guava Orchard
 By Kiran Desai. Anchor/Doubleday, $12.95.
In this opulent Indian novel, a young man climbs a guava tree to escape his fellow humans and finds himself revered as a prophet by both the local villagers and the local monkeys. "It's a parable, an allegory, a bittersweet reminder of the chaos of India," Zia Jaffrey wrote here last year.
 
About This Life: Journeys on the Threshold of Memory
By Barry Lopez. Vintage, $13.
These essays cover a lot of geographic and imaginative territory, from Hokkaido and Antarctica to the author's childhood and the subject of air freight, but at their core is a fascination with the role of landscape in one's life. "Lyrical prose is Lopez's trademark," Sara Wheeler wrote here in 1998. "I enjoyed this rich book hugely."
 
The Translator
By Ward Just. Mariner/Houghton Mifflin, $14.
The hero of this novel is an expatriate German in Paris who can't shake his past -- and his memories of World War II -- when he's called on to help an old friend at the end of the cold war. "Just plots his ironies with a diabolical cunning and patient thoroughness that make them seem inevitable," George Stade wrote here last year. Scott Veale

HEADLINE: The Way We Live Now: 7-18-99: The Ethicist;
Cut-Rate Rationale

BYLINE: By Randy Cohen 

 BODY:
The other day I noticed an unusual sign in the window of a kids' clothing and toy store: Lesbian Moms, 10 Percent Off. Is this ethical (not to mention legal)? I can't imagine a store boasting a sign, White People, 10 Percent Off, for example. But that really got me thinking: what about those Ladies' Nights at bars? - Gina D., Manhattan
By filing complaints against Ladies' Nights with the Department of Human Rights in Washington, John Banzhaf 3d, a law professor at George Washington University, and his students forced several local bars to abandon the practice. 
 But while this argument is right on the law, it is wrong in the heart.
Considering all the places to demand strict economic equality, it would be cold and unfeeling to start, say, at the movie-theater box office. Pay up, Granny! And you, too, little baby! You infants and oldsters have had a free -- or at least moderately discounted -- ride for too long.
Equal pricing is fair in a world of equal paychecks, but if women earn less than men, why not offer them nickel beer? If lesbian moms are hard pressed in other ways, what's the harm in giving them a break here?
While these pricing policies are certainly not meant as economic justice, they do provide a kind of unintended compensation.
Professor Banzhaf and his team were on stronger ethical ground when they filed suits against the all-male Metropolitan and Cosmo clubs, and when they forced dry cleaners to charge women the same price as men for cleaning shirts. The former was an egregious policy of segregation, the latter a failure of the law to recognize the decline of the elaborately pleated blouse. But courtship and mating -- surely at the heart of Ladies' Nights -- are a different case.
The ethics of such policies must be judged by the actual effect they have on the society and not only by their adherence to abstract legal principles. Ladies' Nights subsidize a supply of amorous tipsy women to attract thirsty and infatuated men.
If the result is sociability, flirtation and an increase in the supply of human happiness, drink up. If the result is drunkenness, despair and grim misalliances, it is not just the pricing policy that discredits this institution.
More than a year ago, our bank overcredited our checking account by $400.
I pointed out the error twice, with full documentation, but my letters were ignored. Now when each monthly statement arrives -- service charges have now reduced the balance to $385 -- I wonder: should I just ask for the balance, and send it to a couple of charities? - R. B., Dallas
Even if the tellers are surly, the lines endless and the Muzak some horrible marching-band medley, you still don't get to keep the $400. The bank's error -- no matter how persistent -- does not justify theft.
Your situation is undoubtedly frustrating.
If you'd found a bag of cash that no one came forward to claim, you would eventually be allowed to keep it. But all you've discovered are numbers on a bank balance. Such are the vexations of the cashless economy. That, and the fact that you can't tip an attractive waitperson by making an origami bird out of a Visa card.
While these monthly reminders of the bank's ineptness may be irksome, they do you no real harm. Even if the bank never responds to your courteous letters, you must let the money sit there. It will gradually decay and be absorbed back into the bank in nature's timeless cycle of service charges.
It's humbling, really.

HEADLINE: Olympian Prices

 BODY:

To the Editor: I read with interest Edwin A. Bernstein's letter "Olympian Prices" (June 20). I have had a similar experience with obtaining accommodations in Sydney for the Games.
Because I was a Gold Medalist in the 200-meter Butterfly in Melbourne in the 1956 Games (the first time this event was included in the Olympics), my wife and I have had an intense desire to return for these Games. We have attended most of the summer games in the past, but never have we run into this situation. 
 We applied for tickets from Cartan, the authorized seller, based in Manhattan Beach, Calif. The process itself is difficult, as you must purchase an equal number of Type I and Type II tickets. The Type I tickets are for the most highly sought-after events, whereas the Type II tickets are for those not as popular. (All of the swimming is listed as Type I.)
It was thus necessary for us to request a number of tickets we knew we would not use. The Type I prices are also a source of wonder. The best seats for Opening Ceremonies cost $1,054 a person, with the second-class tickets going for $752. Tickets for the swimming finals each day are $347 a person. Our total ticket order was $8,095.05.
After sending the order to await the lottery, we turned to accommodations. Zone A is the most expensive, nearest most of the venues. Because my wife and I are both in our 60's, we wanted a hotel in Zone A that might allow us to go back to the hotel between events. The price in Zone A for a deluxe twin was $12,340 a person, including economy air fare from Los Angeles and return. I questioned Cartan's prices, as Mr. Bernstein did, only to be given the same answer -- they include breakfasts.
Our total for seeing the Olympic Games in Sydney in the year 2000 is now up to $32,775. And we haven't even gotten a flight from the East Coast to California yet, nor have we calculated in the cost of other meals. These prices effectively put the Games out of range for most folks. You need not be a mathematician to see that this trip could cost $37,000 to $50,000 for 12 days in Sydney.

HEADLINE: If You're Thinking of Living In/Sleepy Hollow, N.Y.;
A Sense of the Past In a Diverse Village

BYLINE: By CHERYL PLATZMAN WEINSTOCK 

 BODY:
AFTER living in Beverly Hills for seven years, Laura and William Carraro, a freelance film producer, longed for the things they couldn't find there.
"I grew up looking at the Hudson River outside the window of my parents' apartment on Riverside Drive," said Mrs. Carraro. "I really wanted to be back looking at that river. I also wanted to live in a neighborhood where I could borrow a cup of sugar and where my kids could have a lifestyle where they could get off the school bus, dump their knapsacks and go out and play." 
 Also crucial to the Carraros was that their two children grow up in a diverse environment. "I think a lot of life's lessons are learned spending time with people not like you," said Mrs. Carraro.
Last year, the Carraros finally found the place for them -- Sleepy Hollow, a culturally and socio-economically diverse village sloping toward the Hudson replete with many historical landmarks.
When he was 16, Washington Irving hunted and fished in what is now Sleepy Hollow and was inspired by its customs and whimsical stories, said Henry Steiner, the village historian. Irving then wrote "The Legend of Sleepy Hollow" about the schoolmaster Ichabod Crane who left a neighbor's party after he tried to court Katrina Van Tassel and encountered the Headless Horseman on the site where Major John Andre was captured with the plans of West Point during the Revolutionary War. Crane vanished as he rode away from the ghost along what is now Route 9, leaving behind a shattered pumpkin.
Though its connections with its Colonial past, evident in the Philipsburg Manor Restoration, make it an interesting village for children and adults alike, Mayor Philip E. Zegarelli said his village had other merits.
"Sleepy Hollow is really a mirror reflection of the greater metropolitan area," he said. "Its diversity from a socio-economic point of view and the blending of the different ethnic backgrounds present a challenge, but also provide a great opportunity to meld all the groups together."
ANDRES VALDESPINO, a villager who works in neighboring Tarrytown at his law firm, Valdespino Copland, said: "Although the Hudson River is a natural boundary of this village, there are few boundaries within it. This is not a bedroom community. It's more like a corridor. A lot of our neighbors work in town, or nearby and we all gather and play during lunch at the Y.M.C.A."
Barbara Eisert, a sales associate for Houlihan/Lawrence in Tarrytown and Irvington, said the village "used to be a harder sell because of its diversity." Now, she said, "whatever comes on the market sells fast. We have no inventory. Maybe because our name has changed it's put us on the map."
The Village of North Tarrytown was renamed Sleepy Hollow in December 1996. Since then, it has attracted many newcomers. Janet Nold, a broker who is district manager of Coldwell Banker in Tarrytown, said that quite apart from its river views and "affordable price ranges," there are myriad housing options ranging from multifamily homes and single-family dwellings to stately colonials and Tudors on the banks of the Hudson.
Ms. Eisert said housing prices begin in the $200,000 to $300,000 range for small, two-bedroom, one-bath colonials, ranches and Cape Cods on 50- by 100-foot properties around the village and in Webber Park. Houses in the $300,000 to $375,000 range are larger, but may back on to Route 9.
From there, she said, houses jump to $450,000 for 1940's and 1950's three- and four-bedroom ranches, split-levels and old colonials with about 2,200 square feet of space on a quarter to a third of an acre in Philipse Manor and Sleepy Hollow Manor. Both neighborhoods have many cul-de-sacs and river views. Ms. Eisert said that renovated homes in the Manors sell for $450,000 to $500,000 and that larger homes go for $650,000 to $750,000.
Nineteen condominium units are available in two town-house complexes, A.R.C.H. and Pocantico Park Condominiums. "But they rarely turn over," said Ms. Eisert. A two-bedroom town house with a one-car garage on the market is selling for $128,000.
Downtown there are also 415 two- and three-family homes scattered along Beekman Avenue and two federally subsidized low-income housing projects with a total of 117 apartments.
"Apartments are rented quickly," said Ms. Nold. They rent from $950 for a one-bedroom to $1,200 for a two-bedroom.
What the schools offer is as varied as the housing stock. "They really have something here for each individual child," Mrs. Carraro said. "They can address everyone's needs. From an academic standpoint of view, I think the district compares favorably to the Beverly Hills school district we left. I feel it's just as challenging."
Donald R. Kusel is superintendent of the 2,194-student Public Schools of the Tarrytowns. The district, which serves the village and adjoining Tarrytown, has five schools -- a kindergarten building, one for first grade, a second and third-grade building, the Washington Irving Intermediate School serving grades four through six and the Sleepy Hollow Middle School/High School.
Dr. Kusel said what made the district work so well -- with its diverse student body that is 8 percent black, 5 percent Asian, 38 percent white and 49 percent Hispanic -- was that "we encourage our teachers to experiment."
"A few years ago some teachers in the district began teaching first-graders Spanish after school," he said. "Then our teachers, on their own time, starting extending the classes to kindergarten and second grade and then integrated the curriculum into the school day. Now we're institutionalizing teaching Spanish."
HIS philosophy of melding the student body together is somewhat unique. "We prefer not to focus on a specific holiday, but to study about our students' different lives every day," Dr. Kusel said. "Even though we don't necessarily work a special day in with a party, we want our kids to know about it and we put it on the school calendar."
In addition to sensitizing the students about one another, Dr. Kusel cites as an example of his policies "our absolute commitment to run an advanced placement course even if only seven or eight kids register for it."
In addition to 15 advanced-placement courses, the district offers several computer science courses and a three-year science research course.
Of the 124 graduating students this year, 77 percent are going on to higher education.
The village has its own police and fire services, as well as the 235-bed Phelps Memorial Hospital Center, which includes a Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Satellite.
VILLAGE landmarks on the National Register of Historic Places include the Tarrytown Lighthouse on the Hudson, the Manor House at Philipsburg Manor, the Captor's Monument at Patriots Park where Major Andre was captured; Kykuit, the mansion that John D. Rockefeller and his son John D. Jr. built in 1913, and the Philipse Manor Railroad Station, restored by the Hudson Valley Writers Center three years ago. The center sponsors readings, courses, performances and other educational events there.
The Old Dutch Church of Sleepy Hollow, a massive stone and brick edifice built in 1685 and immortalized in Irving's ghost story, is also a national landmark. The church, which is still active, is one of six in the village.
The village has a plethora of recreational opportunities in more than 57 acres of parkland.
Visitors to the 18-acre county-owned Kingsland Point Park can picnic, fish and view Kidd's Rock where, said Mr. Steiner, legend has it that Capt. William Kidd conspired with Frederick Philipse to dispose of the pirate's treasure. The private Philipse Manor Beach Club has a 40-slip marina for its members. In 1996 the village opened a catch-and-release trout stream program at the section of the Pocantico River alongside the Old Dutch Church where Irving fished.
But the best opportunity for the village is yet to come.
In June 1996, the 2.8 million-square-foot General Motors plant just north of the Tappan Zee Bridge, which had been primarily producing minivans, shut down, displacing 2,100 employees and creating a large revenue gap for the village. Since then three proposals have been offered for redevelopment, all calling for a mix of housing, offices and retail space.
The proposals for the 96-acre property are now under consideration by both the village and General Motors, which before it closed the plant paid close to $1 million a year in property taxes and now pays $185,000, according to Deputy Mayor Mario DiFelice.
Deborah Lindsay, president of the Sleepy Hollow Chamber of Commerce, said that the anticipation of the development of the downtown had attracted many new restaurants to the village, including Casey's Tarry Inn, an Irish pub; La Pastora, a Chilean restaurant, and Hudson Restaurant and the Sleepy Hollow Castle, which serve American fare.
In 1693, Frederick Philipse owned 100,000 acres of land, including Slapershaven (sleepers' harbor in Dutch), which later became Sleepy Hollow. But because his descendant Frederick Philipse 3d was a Loyalist, the land was confiscated during the American Revolution.
A portion of the village became known as Beekmantown in the early 1800's, after Gerard Beekman purchased 750 acres of the property.
The village was incorporated as North Tarrytown in 1874. Farming and milling continued there until the late 19th century when several manufacturers moved in. General Motors opened its complex in 1918.

HEADLINE: In the Region/Connecticut;
Proposal Advancing for Tallest Stamford Tower

BYLINE: By ELEANOR CHARLES

 BODY:
THE Louis Dreyfus Property Group goes before the Stamford Zoning Board tomorrow evening with a plan to build what would be the tallest structure in Stamford, one floor higher than the 22-story Landmark Building, which is now the city's highest.
Although the plan has passed a number of key hurdles in the approval process, no target starting or completion date has been set for the building. As is the case with two other plans for new buildings, both of which have all their approvals in place, construction dates are awaiting the signing up of enough tenants to make the new buildings financially viable. 
 The Dreyfus Property Group plan calls for a 507,000-square-foot, $125-million office tower to be built on a 3.3-acre site on Washington Boulevard, opposite the Warburg Dillon Read (formerly Swiss Bank) building. The developer is seeking site plan approval and a zoning change from commercial-residential to commercial.
The 23-story building rising 349 feet from mean high tide -- the measurement Stamford uses in certain downtown districts -- would just graze the 350-foot maximum for commercial structures. It has been designed by Skidmore Owings & Merrill of Manhattan, the architectural firm that designed the Swiss Bank building, which since became the headquarters of Warburg Dillon Read, a subsidiary of UBS A.G.
The project was approved in April by the city's Environmental Protection Board and last month by its Planning Board, which functions in an advisory capacity to the Zoning Board. Approvals by the state's Traffic Commission and Department of Environmental Protection and the Stamford Board of Representatives, the city's legislative body, must still be obtained.
If the various agencies all give the green light, the building -- tentatively named Connecticut Place -- would become the third major structure with all approvals in place in Stamford. None of the buildings, however, has a sufficient number of tenants signed up to announce a starting date for construction.
The others still on hold are a 480,000-square-foot building to be developed by Hines Interests Limited Partnership, which was approved two years ago for a site at Atlantic Street and Tresser Boulevard, and a 75,000-square-foot building to be constructed by Collins Enterprises L.L.C., which was approved this year for Shippan Point.
Real estate professionals are skeptical that large-scale office space will be built anytime soon, in spite of a tight upper-end market that should be setting the stage for new construction.
"Dreyfus has a terrific location," said Jeffrey R. Dunne, senior vice president of investments at CB Richard Ellis real estate in Stamford. "The whole Washington Boulevard corridor is where future development seems to be going. Access to I-95 and the train station is excellent, and there are few places for large tenants to go."
But he said that he doubted that Dreyfus, or any developer of a large building, would proceed without preleasing 30 to 40 percent of its space. "The economy is good now, and the forecast for the region is for growth in rents and employment," Mr. Dunne said, "but in a two- or three-year time frame for completion, the economy can change."
Paul King, leasing specialist at CB Richard Ellis, cited an instance where, he said, "a couple of our brokers representing a large user met with Dreyfus, but Dreyfus wouldn't give them a date for completion."
In another situation, he said, "Dreyfus is willing to rent a 65,000-square-foot office building it owns within its proposed construction site to a client who wants to rent short term for two years. Now what does that tell you?"
That building, at 24 Richmond Hill Road, was occupied by Dreyfus until about 10 years ago when the company moved to 10 Westport Road in Wilton. Now, with building permits and approvals in place, Dreyfus has started site work on a speculative office building of 310,000 square feet on its adjacent land at 20 Westport Road.
Dreyfus is agreeable to leasing 26,000- to 300,000-square-foot chunks at Connecticut Place, said David J. Friedman, the company's northeast regional vice president. Spaces of 26,000 square feet, more or less, are, however, available immediately in the city in a market that is showing signs of softening at that level, brokers say.
Stamford's overall vacancy rate for its 14 million square feet of office space is up to 11.9 percent currently from 10.8 at the same time last year, according to Mr. King. But, he noted, even though smaller spaces are coming on the market rental rates in the high $20's per square foot annually to the low $30's are becoming less negotiable. Landlords, according to many brokers, are aggressive. Financial and build-to-suit concessions to new tenants have disappeared.
Ed Tonnessen, executive vice president at the Stamford office of the Albert B. Ashforth commercial brokerage, noted that potential tenants looking for 100,000 square feet and up, have been negotiating around the county for months. But, he said, "nothing is working out."
"Some companies are not financeable, some decide that moving is not cost effective at this time and a shadow market is developing," he said, referring to a practice in which a pocket of space will be sold quietly without ever going on the market.
The rationale for obtaining approvals in this unsettled atmosphere, said Dean J. Shapiro, executive vice president of Insignia/ ESG, the commercial real estate services organization, "is that these developers consider it a marketing advantage to say they're ready to go, or they're going."
"They're looking to create momentum," he said. "They were not pleased to see that Fortune Brands just put its 186,000-square-foot Stamford building on the market."
Real estate people generally agree that if any one building gets built it will be the Dreyfus tower, because, as Mr. Shapiro put it, "the money behind Dreyfus is Apollo, and they may be more flexible in financing." Apollo Real Estate Investment Fund II is Dreyfus's joint venture partner.
The fund, a subsidiary of Apollo Real Estate Advisors, has equity in excess of $3 billion. More than 15 percent of its investments is in half a dozen European countries.
AT Dreyfus headquarters in Wilton, the mood is sanguine. "We've been dealing with over three million square feet of tenant prospects," said Mr. Friedman. "At this point financing is not an issue. We finance from our own corporation, from Apollo, and other sources."
In an unusual procedure for a developer, according to Robin Stein, the city's land use planner, "Dreyfus bought rather than optioned the parcels for its building site." One lot containing the Bibleway Church of God in Jesus Christ, he said, "the developer bought, helped the church find a new site, paid for it, paid for the move and gave the money for renovations. Cooperative is an understatement."
During more than a year of talks with community leaders to help fulfill Mayor Dannel Malloy's wish to provide the public with about a five-block greenbelt from Broad Street to I-95, Dreyfus bought three acres of land bordering the Mill River and across Richmond Hill Avenue, outside its building site. Total land acquisition costs were $1.6 million. Dreyfus and its land planning consultants, Redniss & Mead, then devised their proposal for their new building.
Dreyfus gained a density bonus of 113,998 square feet by donating the three acres to Stamford. On 1.42 acres of the donated land, Dreyfus will create a linear park of 3,500 feet from Broad Street to I-95, with a three-quarter acre easement for public access to the area. The city considers the rest of the property, across Richmond Hill Avenue, a potential housing site, which it can sell to a developer.
The city also agreed to eliminate an extension of Clinton Avenue that bisects the building site. And, in return for allowing evening and weekend use by the public of 176 parking spaces in its proposed 1,380-space garage, Dreyfus received an additional 35,200-square-foot density bonus.
Before construction begins, Dreyfus must demolish several buildings and clean up pollution caused by a gas station. It has also promised the city to grade, seed and landscape the strip it will donate along the river, and provide a public walkway and benches.
"What Dreyfus did," said Rick Redniss, a partner in Redniss & Mead, "was to come in and say, 'Here's what we want to do. Now what do you want?' instead of, 'This is what we want, give it to us.' They accomplished in one application what could have taken years." Until now the city had been unsuccessful in acquiring land for the linear park through grants because it can only pay market value, Mr. Redniss said.
The Dreyfus office building -- bounded on the east by Washington Boulevard, where the building entrance will be situated; on the south by the I-95 right-of-way; on the west by the Mill River and on the north by Richmond Hill Avenue -- will have a 5,000-square-foot public restaurant on the ground floor overlooking the river.
Tenants will have exclusive use of a third-floor cafeteria and a fitness room. The seven-story garage, accessed from Richmond Hill Avenue, will be joined to the building's rear, with two stories underground. Its roof will be landscaped with a circular lawn area, clusters of bamboo trees, a sculpture, and two types of bluestone flooring laid out in a striped pattern.
Mustafa K. Abadan of Skidmore, Owings & Merrill described the building's exterior as a glass curtain wall facing Long Island Sound, with glass and precast concrete walls on the remaining sides "What we started with Swiss Bank," he said, "the city considers a gateway to the city. We are making sure the buildings are complementary without being alike."
Louis Dreyfus Property Group is a subsidiary of S. A. Louis Dreyfus & Cie, a family-owned business founded in 1851 and based in Paris. The parent company is active in agricultural commodities, energy products, ships, manufacturing, and other diversified businesses.

HEADLINE: The View From/Yonkers;
Reunion at Orphanage Remembers Good Life

BYLINE: By LYNNE AMES 

DATELINE: YONKERS

 BODY:
WHEN Lynn Keyser McSpedon feels unhappy, she gets in her car and drives from her home in Hawthorne to the Julia Dykman Andrus Memorial children's home here. "It gives me a warm feeling, a safe feeling, a feeling like I'm coming home, just to drive through the campus," the 55-year-old Mrs. McSpedon said.
What is pretty remarkable about this is that Andrus, as it is generally known, was the institution where Mrs. McSpedon grew up. Although it is now a residential school primarily for children with emotional problems, it was then a place for youngsters who themselves were fine but whose parents were dead or could not keep them at home for financial or other reasons. Mrs. McSpedon lived there from age 5 through 18, from 1949 through 1962, and her memories are all good ones. The stereotype of an orphanage -- of any place where young people live without their families -- is of something dark, lonely and forbiddingly disciplinarian. Yet Mrs. McSpedon -- and 150 or so other student alumni who recently gathered for a reunion -- had nothing but praise for the place where they did at least part of their growing up. 
 "Here, I was allowed to express myself in my fullest," said Felicia McInnis-Lassiter, a 44-year-old artist and photographer who came to Andrus at 14 and stayed three years. "I had all the art supplies I needed. I had been living in New York City and was having some conflicts with my dad. Here, I had an apple orchard on the property, peach trees and a grape arbor. I ate meals in a dining room with white linen tablecloths."
Guy Gustafson, a 20-year-old who was in Andrus for three years beginning in the late 1980's, added, "At first I resisted the concept, but I wound up really loving this place." A tall, thin young man with pale blue eyes, dressed all in black with his hair in a ponytail, he does not seem at first to be the type to embrace any official institution, even a pleasant and benign one. He said he had gotten into trouble at home and at school and was sent to Andrus. "Like I said, at first, I resented it, but I really got to love it." He even promoted the place to a 13-year-old current resident who was complaining that she wanted to return home. "And what, go to public school in the Bronx?" he said. "I'm not into that."
The reunion took place on the rolling lawns of the 100-plus-acre campus in the northwest corner of this city. For a newcomer it was easy to see the visual appeal of the place, with its hilly vistas, apple orchard and well-maintained Tudor-style buildings. Indeed, when it was founded in 1928 by the philanthropist John E. Andrus in memory of his wife, Julia Dykman, it was so exclusive as to be exclusionary: "Only white Anglo-Saxon Protestants were allowed" until the mid-1960's, Wendi Selby said. Ms. Selby, who is black, lived at Andrus from 1969 through 1971 and now works there as a clinical social worker.
Until the mid-1970's, when social and economic changes required a shift in focus, the institution, which is both privately and publicly financed, operated primarily as an orphanage, providing a place to live for children and teen-agers whose parents had either died or were unable to raise them.
Several alumni recalled being from large families where there simply was not enough money; others remembered parents plagued by chronic physical or mental illness. The children were, for the most part, not only "normal," but many were also high achievers who said at the reunion that their unfortunate situations combined with the upbringing they got at Andrus spurred them on to greater autonomy later in life.
"This place made me aggressive in a good way, independent; it gave me the feeling that nothing was too difficult to accomplish," said Joe Antizzo, who lived there from 1948 to 1959. Mr. Antizzo, 57, recently retired from financial work on Wall Street ("It really didn't make sense for me to work anymore," he said with obvious satisfaction). He came from modest beginnings, having been born on West 98th Street in Manhattan "before it was gentrified." His mother was "a worker and she didn't feel she could keep me at home." Although at the time he did not quite understand why he had been sent away, he liked the place where he wound up and began considering it his second home.
So it was with a younger generation, too. Sitting at tables under a white tent, sipping soda and eating barbecued chicken and charcoaled, marinated flank steak (requested because that had been one of the most frequent Andrus meals), alumni greeted one another with kisses, handshakes and squeals of "My God, you look great." Among them were four women in their 40's who had formed a clique when they were there in the late 1960's and early 70's.
Ms. Selby, Ms. McInnis-Lassiter, Paula Kelly, a graphics designer, and Arlene Schilb, an accountant, were once close friends. They keep in touch mainly by telephone now -- Ms. Selby lives in Yonkers, Ms. Kelly in Manhattan, Ms. Schilb in New Milford, Conn., and Ms. McInnis-Lassiter in Newport News, Va. But like many old, good friends, they pick up right where they left off when they see one another, with lots of grins and giggles and easy-flowing reminiscences.
"Felicia was more the rebel type," Ms. Selby said of her friend, who nodded in agreement and said, "You bet I was."
Ms. Selby continued: "She was the one who taught me about black power and Afro hairdos. I embraced more traditional middle-class values. I had a hard time trying to find my identity. I remember a civil rights march that I went on. I agonized over it first. My peers were expecting me to go and I did, but I was scared to death I'd get arrested." The women also talked about the minutiae that made up everyday life at Andrus: the pastel pink dorm rooms big enough to sleep four comfortably; the meals cooked in individual cottages, especially the vats of fresh scrambled eggs, from eggs sometimes plucked from chickens right on campus, and the fact that residents went to local public schools on a big gray bus (now they attend special classes on campus).
"That bus -- we had to get up so early in the morning; how did we get up in the morning? Did we set alarms?" asked Ms. Kelly who, like Ms. Schilb, is a youthful-looking woman with sleek blond hair.
Ms. Selby practically shouted: "The bell! A big brass bell."
Ms. Kelly said: "Oh, my God, that's right. There was a real dinner bell. We'd be in the peach orchard and that dinner bell would ring, and we'd all come running."
The bell is gone now, but the Andrus experience still resonates with these, and, apparently, with many alumni. "There was a certain personality Andrus hand picked," Ms. Selby said. "They had an idea of who they wanted. Resilient . . ."
Ms. Kelly interjected, "Well-developed and creative."
Ms. Selby added: "Yes, that too, and independent and ambitious. You were expected to appreciate Andrus -- Andrus gave you the best there was."

Also attending were Velma Bandel and Hunter Kelly, far left. Old photographs recall a Christmas celebration at the home, which originally operated as an orphanage for children whose parents had died or were unable to raise them. It is now primarily for children with emotional problems. (Photographs by Chris Maynard for The New York Times)
