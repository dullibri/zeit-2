HEADLINE: Isolated, Vulnerable And Broke

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS S. MASSEY. 
Douglas S. Massey is a professor of sociology and public affairs at Princeton and the author of ''Categorically Unequal: The American Stratification System.''

 BODY:
Princeton, N.J.
ACCORDING to a new study by the Pew Research Center, Hispanic families saw the largest decline in wealth of any racial or ethnic group in the country during the latter half of the last decade: from 2005 to 2009, their median wealth fell by an astounding 66 percent. The reason? The implosion of the housing market, where Hispanic families had invested much of their wealth.
But that's only the latest chapter in a much longer story. Over the past two decades Hispanics have moved from the middle of the socioeconomic hierarchy, between blacks and whites, to a position below both. On virtually every indicator of socioeconomic welfare, Hispanics fell relative to blacks. 
This has nothing to do with nativist tropes like work ethic or resistance to assimilation and everything to do with misguided government policy: our immigration and border-control system has created a class of people cut off from traditional legal and economic structures and thus vulnerable to the worst depredations of the market system.
During the housing bubble, those depredations came in the form of predatory lenders, driven by the boom in mortgage-backed securities. Before that, minorities had generally been shunned by lenders, which tended to be risk averse and discriminatory.
In the new system, the amount lent was no longer constrained by deposits, merely by the willingness of investors to buy mortgage-backed securities. The more mortgages that could be originated, the more bonds could be created and sold, and the more profits could be made; best of all, investors bore the risks.
Mortgage brokers quickly saturated underserved black and Hispanic neighborhoods with seductive lending packages. But the system of ever expanding lending depended on a steadily rising housing market, and when the bubble burst everything came crashing down. Because minorities had been singled out for subprime lending, delinquent loans and foreclosures were disproportionately concentrated in black and Hispanic neighborhoods after the collapse.
Yet subprime lending affected both blacks and Hispanics and, if anything, predatory lenders went after the former more than the latter. So why did Hispanics suffer more?
The answer is simple: over time more and more Hispanics had become economically vulnerable and eminently exploitable, a fact attributable in large part to American immigration policy.
In the early 1990s the United States began militarizing its border with Mexico in an effort to halt unauthorized migration. This disrupted a significant but largely circular flow of illegal migrants: according to estimates from the Mexican Migration Project, between 1965 and 1985, for every 100 undocumented entries there were 85 undocumented departures, yielding only a small net increase in the undocumented population each year.
Because of the irresistible draw of the American economy, militarization of the border didn't really affect undocumented in-migration, but it did reduce out-migration -- migrants knew that once they left it would be hard to get back in. Whereas there were an estimated 3 million undocumented migrants in 1990, the number rose thereafter to peak around 12 million in 2007 and 2008, at which point half of all Salvadoran immigrants, 60 percent of all Mexican immigrants and two-thirds of Guatemalan and Honduran immigrants were here illegally.
Thus the sudden creation of a new class of people, working low-wage jobs outside the legal labor markets. Not only was it difficult for them to safely accumulate wealth, but they were left uniquely vulnerable to economic exploitation -- such as the promise of a mortgage with little documentation required at signing.
When the Great Recession arrived, many Hispanics got hit with a double whammy: not only were many Hispanic homeowners left with negative equity, but the collapse of construction jobs, which had been a primary draw for immigrants beforehand, eliminated the very means by which they could continue making mortgage payments.
And because many were working and living in legal gray areas, they had little recourse when they learned their mortgages came with ballooning fee structures and onerous penalties for late payments. What little wealth they had managed to accumulate simply vanished.
Even worse, there is little chance that things will improve when the economy finally begins to expand. Until the country fundamentally changes its immigration policy to remove millions from the legal shadows, the entire economy will continue to suffer as its most vulnerable participants watch their fortunes disappear at the slightest downturn.

HEADLINE: The Right Way to Trim

BYLINE: By JOSEPH S. NYE Jr.. 
Joseph S. Nye Jr., a former assistant secretary of defense, is a professor at the Harvard Kennedy School and the author, most recently, of ''The Future of Power.''

 BODY:
Cambridge, Mass.
THE recent debt deal will slash the defense budget over the next decade. And if Congress can't agree on an additional $1.5 trillion in cuts, the law's ''trigger mechanism'' will lead to deeper reductions in military spending. The initial cuts will not imperil America's national security, but the deeper cuts could.
The administration of George W. Bush nearly doubled the defense budget following 9/11. With the winding down of Mr. Bush's two wars, we could cut our ground forces to 1990s levels, reduce the planned purchases of F-35 Joint Strike Fighters, make greater use of cheaper drones and other technologies, and deal with the escalating costs of the defense health care system -- without serious damage to national security. Indeed, President Obama's budget had already planned for $400 billion in defense savings by 2023. 
But it is not enough to tinker with the defense budget. We also need to rethink how we use our military power. Unlike the state of affairs during the cold war, the United States and its allies today account for over 70 percent of world military expenditure. The No. 1 power no longer has to patrol every boundary and seek to police every country. Opponents of defense cuts are raising the specter of isolationism and the weakening of American power. But there is a middle way.
At the height of the cold war, President Dwight D. Eisenhower decided against direct military intervention on the side of the French in Vietnam in 1954 because he was convinced that it was more important to preserve the strength of the American economy. Today, such a strategy would avoid involvement of ground forces in major wars in Asia or in other poor countries. While it will take time to extricate ourselves from Mr. Bush's post-9/11 strategy, we must start, as the National Security Strategy of 2010 states, ''by recognizing that our strength and influence abroad begins with the steps we take at home.'' Eisenhower could have said that -- and no one could accuse Ike of being an isolationist.
Counterinsurgency is attractive as a military tactic but it should not lead us into a strategy of nation-building in places where we do not have the capacity to engineer change. The maxim of avoiding major land wars in poor countries does not mean withdrawing our military presence from places like Japan and South Korea, or ending military assistance to countries like Pakistan and Egypt. Some analysts call this ''off-shore balancing,'' but that term must mean more than just naval and air force activity. For example, in Japan and South Korea, our allies pay a significant portion of the cost for basing American troops there because they want an insurance policy in a region faced with a rising China and a volatile North Korea.
Over the course of this century, Asia will return to its historic status, with more than half of the world's population and half of the world's economic output. America must be present there. Markets and economic power rest on political frameworks, and American military power provides that framework. Military security is to order as oxygen is to breathing: underappreciated until it becomes scarce. That is why the new bipartisan Congressional commission must provide the revenues that allow America to continue to play this vital role while avoiding the trap of overly ambitious nation-building.
Such a strategy is also sustainable at home. The British historian Niall Ferguson, an enthusiast for empire, lamented at the time of the Iraq war that the United States lacked the capacity for empire because of three domestic deficits: personnel (not enough boots on the ground); attention (not enough public support for long-term occupation); and financial (not enough savings and not enough taxation relative to public expenditure). He was correct.
Lacking a stomach for empire or colonial occupation is one of the important ways in which American political culture differs from that of imperial Britain. Americans like to promote universal values. But rather than succumbing to the temptation to intervene on the side of ''the good,'' we can do it best by being what Ronald Reagan called ''a shining city on a hill.''
The alternatives we face today are not an untouchable defense budget or isolationism. A smart strategy for preserving America's power and global role will depend on wisely tailoring our foreign policy to fit the cloth we have. Eisenhower knew this well.

HEADLINE: Republicans, Fresh From Debt Battle, Set Sights on Balanced Budget Amendment

BYLINE: By JENNIFER STEINHAUER

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- House Republicans, feeling they have scored significant fiscal victories, are moving on to an even bigger challenge: persuading voters, state legislatures and Democrats to alter the Constitution with a balanced budget amendment.
In a meeting with his conference on Monday, Speaker John A. Boehner told members that the best thing they could do during the August recess was to sell their constituents on the idea that the amendment -- which essentially stipulates that government cannot spend more than it takes in -- is necessary and good.
Republican leaders on the Hill have pivoted from railing against Democrats about tax increases to pressing for the amendment, which would require the acquiescence of two-thirds of each chamber of Congress, and three-quarters of state legislatures. They point out that such a measure passed the House in 1995, but then failed in the Senate by a single vote. 
And if Congress passes a proposed amendment, it bypasses the president, going straight to the states, where 26 legislatures are dominated by Republicans.
Getting Democrats to agree to such a measure now is likely to be an uphill battle. President Obama has previously rejected the idea of a balanced budget amendment. And, after the nasty debt-ceiling duel with Republicans, which left the country a cat's whisker from default, most Congressional Democrats are bruised and cranky, with little incentive to work with the other side.
Further, of the roughly 10 bills filed by House Republicans to create such an amendment, most contain provisions, like setting a high bar for votes on future debt-ceiling increases, that few Democrats in either chamber would abide. The nation's fiscal situation is far worse than in the 1990s, when a balanced budget would have required much less drastic cutting than what would be required today.
Opponents argue that an amendment could hamstring the government at times that it needs to run deficits, comparing it, for example, to a situation in which families would be forbidden to get mortgages to buy homes. Most of the versions being proposed this year in the House and Senate do contain a provision that the amendment would be waived when the country is in a declared time of war.
But for Democrats seeking to redefine themselves as careful fiscal stewards on the cusp of the 2012 campaign, the idea of a balanced budget amendment free of hard-line provisions is not an impossible sell. Several Senate Democrats have said in the past that they support such an amendment, and Senator Mark Udall of Colorado has already put forth his own measure.
''I think it is definitely achievable,'' said Representative Robert W. Goodlatte, Republican of Virginia, who has offered two balanced budget amendments, one far more conservative than the other. ''I have been talking to dozens of Democrats in the House about this, and there is a tremendous amount of interest in this issue.''
Under the agreement to lift the debt ceiling approved by Congress and signed by President Obama this week, a second, $1.5 trillion increase is contingent upon either the adoption of deficit reductions recommended by a new Congressional ''super committee'' or Congressional passage of a balanced budget amendment. If neither is done, large cuts to military spending and some social programs would automatically be made. Nearly every state has some form of balanced budget provision, though most are more flexible than those proposed for the federal government.
''It is almost so institutionalized now, though there is a variance in stringency,'' said Brian Sigritz, the director of state fiscal studies for the National Association of State Budget Officers.
In the House, the two measures that have gained the most traction are Mr. Goodlatte's, which prohibit outlays exceeding total receipts for that fiscal year, other than interest payments, unless Congress says otherwise in a three-fifths vote of each chamber.
The more conservative version would require a two-thirds majority in the House and the Senate to raise taxes and a spending cap of 18 percent of the gross domestic product, unless two-thirds of each chamber of Congress provides for a specific increase above this amount. The measures require a three-fifths roll call vote in each chamber to increase the public debt limit.
''The more tough version has broad Republican support,'' Mr. Goodlatte said, ''but it's not going to get the 290 votes needed.''
The other measure, similar to the amendment that passed the House in 1995, has support from even those members who offered their own right-leaning options, he said.
In the Senate, Mr. Udall's amendment faces significant hurdles with Republicans, largely because it prohibits Congress from providing income tax breaks for people earning more than $1 million a year, except during years of budget surpluses. Another senator, Mike Lee, Republican of Utah, has his own measure, and the two men have been playing phone tag trying to set up a time to talk about their proposals.
Many Democrats, even moderates, have raised skepticism about any balanced budget amendment offered by a Republican.
''As someone who supported the 1995 balanced budget amendment, let me say that at this point in time I would not support it,'' Representative Steny H. Hoyer, the Democratic whip, said in a recent meeting with reporters. Mr. Hoyer added, ''I don't have any confidence that even at a time of great challenge, that there aren't 40 percent-plus one in the House that would oppose doing something necessary to assure the country was on a sound footing.''
Republicans have also expressed their doubts. In a recent speech on the floor of the Senate, Senator John McCain of Arizona said: ''I will take a back seat to none in my support of the balanced budget amendment to the Constitution. I have voted for it 13 times. I will vote for it tomorrow. What is amazing about this is some members are believing we can pass a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution in this body with its present representation, and that is foolish. That is worse than foolish.''
But none of this is likely to stop Republican supporters from pushing the issue, as they have with all their fiscal policy hopes and dreams in the 112th Congress.
''House and Senate passage of the balanced budget amendment will make reckless borrowing a thing of the past and will ensure that our children enjoy futures full of opportunity,'' Representative Eric Cantor of Virginia, the majority leader, said in a recent op-ed article. ''Let Democrats and Republicans join together to do the right thing and make a real difference for the future.''

HEADLINE: In Need of Deficit Plan, Congress Opts for Several

BYLINE: By CATHERINE RAMPELL

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Congress says it has a plan for addressing the government's deficit problems. But it does not. Instead, it merely has a plan for a plan for a plan, effectively commanding Congress to continue fighting over budget priorities through the 2012 elections.
The law has two separate -- and equally fragile -- phases for deficit savings. 
The first is a set of spending caps that start in the 2012 fiscal year, which begins Oct. 1 of this year, and extend for 10 years. The second involves a to-be-determined budget plan for additional, deeper cuts over that same time period. These cuts will be recommended by a bipartisan committee and voted on by Jan 15.
If no such plan passes, an autopilot budget trigger will kick in instead, requiring substantial cuts equally divided between domestic and national security spending.
The first phase cuts $21 billion in the 2012 fiscal year to address a projected deficit of $1.1 trillion in a budget with outlays of roughly $3.6 trillion. It would also reduce projected deficits by $917 billion over a decade.
But the bill does not specify which individual programs to cut, or which, if any, taxes to increase, to achieve those savings. Instead, the legislation calls for caps on broad categories of spending, and leaves it to the House and Senate, where partisan differences on the issues are running as deep as ever, to work out the specifics.
''Setting the cap for appropriations in advance, and putting that into law, does count for something,'' said Sarah Binder, a political science historian at George Washington University. ''But no, it doesn't actually tell you whose ox gets gored.''
All this means that Congress will return from its August recess and land back in this summer's budget fight. Legislators have not yet appropriated money for the 2012 fiscal year, and in September they will have to figure out how to achieve cuts that add up to the $21 billion.
Then they will move to the second phase, which involves creating a special Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction to come up with a bipartisan plan to reduce deficits by an additional $1.2 trillion over the next decade. This $1.2 trillion in savings would be in addition to the $917 billion in cuts mandated by the first phase.
Congress has given itself until Jan. 15 to pass a proposal by the joint committee. Failing to meet that deadline activates a sort of punishment: a budget plan that automatically cuts $1.2 trillion over the next decade, with the cuts distributed relatively evenly over time.
''The idea behind this trigger is it would be so unpalatable, for very different reasons, for both Democrats and Republicans, that they'll have to come up with something else they like better,'' said Michael Linden, director for tax and budget policy at the Center for American Progress, a liberal research organization.
This trigger plan, though, is just another overall spending cap, with no direction about which individual programs to cut. It dictates that the cuts must come evenly from military and nonmilitary spending. But those broad categories encompass hundreds of different programs. Nonmilitary spending alone includes housing, highways, education, prisons and scientific research.
''In general, when Congress was hitting a cap in the past, practically nobody has been spared, but that was in the past,'' said Richard Kogan, a senior fellow at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a research organization. ''The question now is whether real needs are the same, and if interest groups are proportionally about as powerful as they were in the past. We just don't know. The makeup of the House is different than it was in the past, and Republicans are not like the Republicans we saw in the past.''
The trigger plan is intended to force both parties to compromise on the composition of the second phase of deficit reduction. But the magnitude of the cuts in the first few years is actually quite modest in the scale of the federal budget and the projected deficits.
Moreover, while the trigger would be activated in January if the joint committee's recommendations are not adopted and Congress does not pass a balanced budget amendment, the automatic across-the-board spending cuts would not go into effect for a year.
This date is telling for two reasons.
First, even if the trigger is activated and the cuts become law, members of Congress still have over a year to rescind them, as they have done in the past with other budget constraints they deemed unpalatable.
''The joint committee has a chance of success only if people believe that, if it fails, the pain of the sequester will bite,'' said Keith Hennessey, a former economic adviser to President George W. Bush and a research fellow at the Hoover Institution, a conservative research organization. ''If they instead think that Congress and the president will renegotiate that bite in a 2012 postelection lame duck session, or that a new Congress and maybe president will renegotiate them in early 2013, then there's a very high likelihood that the threat of pain will be diminished, and that the joint committee will therefore fail.''
Second, January is an odd month to choose for a spending cap to start. The fiscal year starts on Oct. 1; historically it is unusual to plan on enacting a spending cap in the middle of a fiscal year, according to political historians and budget analysts.
The January timing was perhaps chosen so that legislators would not have to make any hard decisions until after the 2012 elections, Mr. Kogan said. But they will still be able to spend the campaign season warning about the threat of a cap and the permutations of spending cuts it could create.
Previous efforts by Congress to bind its own hands have almost always failed.
''I'm a skeptic about these kinds of things,'' said Alan J. Auerbach, an economics and law professor at the University of California, Berkeley. ''You're sort of saying, 'I can't control myself, so I'm putting in this external mechanism to control myself, but I'm also in control of the external mechanism.' ''

HEADLINE: A Striking Evolution in Bedford-Stuyvesant as the White Population Soars

BYLINE: By SAM ROBERTS

 BODY:
Mark Dunlea and his wife, Judith A. Enck, moved to Brooklyn from upstate New York two years ago. Last March, they breached the blurry Clinton Hill border to buy an apartment in a four-story condominium that had replaced an abandoned warehouse in Bedford-Stuyvesant.
The couple say they do not feel like pioneers in the gentrification of Bedford-Stuyvesant, the neighborhood in central Brooklyn that traces its African-American roots to the early 19th century and has been the borough's black cultural capital for decades.
''We just feel so lucky to be in such a vibrant neighborhood,'' Ms. Enck said. Mr. Dunlea, the director of the Hunger Action Network of New York State, added, ''To us, if you're going to move to New York City, one of the benefits is a really diverse neighborhood.''
Overshadowed by Harlem's racial metamorphosis since 2000, an even more striking evolution has occurred in Bedford-Stuyvesant. Over all, the neighborhood is now barely 60 percent black -- down from 75 percent a decade ago. But in the older Bedford section west of Throop Avenue, according to the 2010 census, blacks have recently become a minority of the population for the first time in 50 years. 
''Both the fall of the crime rate and the improvement of the subway were conditions that made this neighborhood more attractive to people who might not have considered living there in the past,'' said John H. Mollenkopf, director of the Center for Urban Research at the Graduate Center of the City University of New York.
Arthur Kell, 54, a jazz musician and composer who is white and who bought a brownstone in Bedford with two friends five years ago, said, ''It seems to be similar to what I saw happen in Fort Greene starting in 1997.''
In the past decade, the black population of Bedford dropped to 34,000 from 40,000, or to 49 percent from 69 percent. Meanwhile, the number of whites grew to more than 18,000, up from just over 2,000, or to 26 percent, up from 4 percent.
From 2000 to 2010, the white population soared 633 percent -- the biggest percentage increase of any major racial or ethnic group in any New York City neighborhood. In Central Harlem, meanwhile, the number of whites rose 400 percent, increasing their share of the population to 10 percent, up from 2 percent.
''When I moved here 10 years ago, I was the first white guy on the block,'' said Ryan McCullough, 48, a sculptor, who lives off Bedford Avenue with his wife and rents out the top two floors of his three-story brownstone to four tenants. Now, he said, nearly half of the residents on his street are white.
''In the 2010 census, the first thing we noticed was how the concentrations in many traditional black and white areas dropped off across so many blocks,'' said Steven Romalewski, director of the mapping service of the Center for Urban Research at CUNY's Graduate Center, which analyzed the census results block by block.
In Brooklyn, he said, ''you can see how the white population, for example, is shifting eastward into traditionally black areas, while blacks are also moving eastward, especially to Flatlands and Canarsie.''
In Clinton Hill, Fort Greene and Williamsburg, ''the prices are so astronomically high that obviously the next place to go to is Bedford-Stuyvesant or Bushwick,'' said Henry L. Butler, the chairman of Community Board 3 in Bedford-Stuyvesant.
''You're getting new money, new people, you get different types of services and stores, and you get more police protection,'' he said. ''Homeowners are doing well, but if you're a renter, those prices have gone up also and that has pushed some people into moving out.''
Michael Guerra, executive vice president of Prudential Douglas Elliman and its Brooklyn sales director, said the neighborhood was attracting students from the nearby Pratt Institute, as well as ''couples and singles who are looking for more value and a segment of pioneers who think there's a long-term upside.''
The spillover from more expensive neighborhoods, like Williamsburg, Fort Greene and Clinton Hill, has produced a striking metamorphosis in relatively short order.
On Greene Avenue, down the block from Mr. Dunlea and Ms. Enck, a four-family town house is listed at $1.5 million. An area that epitomized racial tension around a pizza parlor in Spike Lee's 1989 film ''Do the Right Thing'' is now home to several Zagat-rated restaurants and to Nice (as in France) Pizza, which features a ''La Baltique'' pie topped with smoked salmon and heavy cream ($20 for the 16-inch version).
A section of Bedford is moving toward being designated a historic district in the neighborhood that, 30 years ago, Billy Joel crooned he might ''be crazy'' to walk through alone.
Tremaine Wright, 38, a lawyer who opened Common Grounds, an upscale coffeehouse on Tompkins Avenue four years ago and lives nearby in the house her grandfather bought in the 1940s, says the resurgence of businesses and other services has also attracted younger blacks who might otherwise have moved away.
''I have a solid peer group here,'' said Ms. Wright, who is black. ''The real gentrification is people staying instead of leaving.''
The extent of racial integration, so far, has been mixed in Bedford-Stuyvesant, which the city's Planning Department defines roughly as bounded by Throop, Classon and Flushing Avenues and Fulton Street.
''Some white residents are involved in local block associations and community-based advocacy groups,'' said John L. Flateau, a professor of public administration at Medgar Evers College. ''But there are also a number of white families and single hipsters moving into Bed-Stuy, as renters and owners, who seem to be disconnected from, unaware of, and oblivious to Bed-Stuy's rich, historical legacy of social capital, community networks and its politics.''
Professor Flateau, who is black and lives in the area, said whites represented ''a vibrant part of a new entrepreneurial class'' and added: ''My concern is the social cohesion gap created by the home sellers and evacuees and stubbornly slow immersion and social integration by the new urban pioneers.
''Some home sellers were one step shy of foreclosure; others are retirees, heading back 'down South.' Still others cannot manage New York's high cost of living, high black unemployment, very tight, high-skills job market, etc. In any event, this constitutes a major drain on Bed-Stuy's social and economic capital.''
Assemblyman Hakeem Jeffries, who represents the area, said ''some African-American homeowners have sold their houses and returned down South with the ability to improve their quality of life from a space standpoint or are moving to other parts of Brooklyn and to the suburbs.''
''Others,'' he continued, ''have remained in Bedford-Stuyvesant, but have rented parts of their home out to newcomers, both black and white, to benefit from the increased market.'' (The number of renters since 2000 has increased at a higher rate than the number of owners.)
Still, he said, ''the area has undergone dramatic racial and socio-economic change, but at its core Bedford-Stuyvesant remains Bedford-Stuyvesant with a proud history and tradition infused with African-American culture.''

HEADLINE: End the Debt Limit: The limit is not necessary, or good for the economy, and is now a political hand grenade

 BODY:
It has long been clear that the federal debt limit is far too dangerous and unstable for lawmakers to use as a political weapon. Allowing that to happen in the last few traumatic weeks created an artificial national crisis that put the economy and the savings of Americans at risk and helped produce a loss of confidence that lingered as a cause of Thursday's stock-market plunge.
None of that, however, has stopped Republican leaders, who announced this week that they intend to repeat this explosive episode over and over, in perpetuity. With the bad memory still fresh, President Obama should quickly seize the opportunity to make clear that he will not allow it even once more, never mind permanently. Instead of raising the debt ceiling every few years, it's time to eliminate this dangerous game once and for all. 
As this page said in 1961 -- not remotely for the first time or the last -- the ''debt limit does not limit the debt.'' It's an illusion of a law, instituted in World War I, to persuade gullible taxpayers that Congress is exercising responsible oversight over borrowing. Congress already controls spending and taxation, and if it wants a smaller debt it can cut spending or raise taxes at will. To allow the deficit to rise, and then refuse to pay for it months later, is the definition of financial irresponsibility.
But being irresponsible worked for Republicans this time. They refused to raise the limit without cuts in spending and won $2.5 trillion in cuts in the deal wrapped up on Tuesday. Now they want to make permanent the arbitrary and simplistic standard devised by Speaker John Boehner -- a dollar of cuts for every dollar in the debt increase.
Senator Mitch McConnell, the Republican leader, said on Tuesday that no president of either party should ever be allowed to raise the ceiling ''without having to engage in the kind of debate we've just come through.''
Mr. McConnell may call it a ''debate,'' but what his party really did was threaten the economy with catastrophe in the blind pursuit of huge spending cuts with no tax increases. He admitted that he saw the ceiling as ''a hostage that's worth ransoming.'' No president or voter should tolerate that level of disregard for the national good.
The debt limit should ideally be dispensed with, but, at a minimum, it can no longer be held for ransom. The president and Congress are free to continue talks to reduce the deficit, but not while the economy is dangling in the balance. The president should assemble a coalition of business leaders, mayors, governors and ordinary Americans ready to spend the next year explaining to voters why the debt limit should be eliminated, or blunted as a tool to change budgetary policy. If Democrats continuously remind the country how dangerous this path is, Republicans may think twice about repeating it.
If they do not, Mr. Obama could meet their challenge with a legal threat. The White House has repeatedly demurred when asked if a provision of the 14th Amendment could be used to declare the debt ceiling invalid, saying it was an untested theory. There is more than a year for administration lawyers to find ways to put it into practice.
The 14th Amendment, adopted during Reconstruction, says the validity of the public debt of the United States cannot be questioned. Threatening the economy with calamity to achieve partisan goals does just that. President Obama should use every power at his disposal to fend off Republicans' irresponsible threats and invite them to meet him in court if they want to resist.

HEADLINE: Jobless Claims Fall Slightly

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
WASHINGTON (Reuters) -- The number of Americans claiming new unemployment benefits was steady last week, nudging down 1,000 to 400,000, the Labor Department said on Thursday. Economists had expected initial jobless claims to rise to 405,000, and the dip last week indicated an easing in layoffs. 
''While the economic slowdown appears to be stretching into the third quarter, what really matters is jobs,'' said Millan Mulraine, a macroeconomic strategist at TD Securities in New York. Data so far shows the anemic economic growth persisted early in the third quarter, with manufacturing activity hitting a two-year low in July and the services sector expanding at its slowest pace in nearly 1 1/2 years.
''We expect economic activity to improve in the second half of the year, which should result in better labor market conditions,'' said Michael Gapen, a senior economist at Barclays Capital.
The claims data came before Friday's release of the government's comprehensive July employment report.
Nonfarm payrolls most likely increased 85,000 last month, according to a Reuters survey, after rising only 18,000 in June. The jobless rate is expected to hold steady at 9.2 percent.
The four-week moving average of claims, considered a better measure of trends, fell to its lowest level since mid-April.

HEADLINE: Retreating on Every Front: Unnerved Investors Chase Low-Risk Assets

BYLINE: By NELSON D. SCHWARTZ; Julie Creswell contributed reporting.

 BODY:
It was a frantic flight to safety.
Investors roared into Treasury bonds, cash and other low-risk assets on Thursday, acting on their fears about the weak global economic outlook on a day when stock markets in the United States declined more than 4 percent.
Just last week, the markets showed signs of nervousness about the government's creditworthiness during a standoff over Washington's debt limit. But on Thursday, yields on two-year Treasury notes touched 0.26 percent, the lowest ever, while the yield on the benchmark 10-year bond dropped 21 basis points to 2.41. 
The low yields reflected a surging demand for Treasuries, which have long been considered almost as secure as cash. The 10-year rates approached depths not seen since October 2010, shortly before the Federal Reserve began to pump hundreds of billions of dollars into the economy amid fears of a slowdown.
Rates on even shorter-term credit, including six-month Treasury bills and overnight loans in the vast market for repurchase agreements, swung toward zero Thursday. Yields on one-month bills actually fell into negative territory before closing at zero.
Above all else, cash has become the investments of choice this week as the deepening economic and debt worries in the United States and Europe have made stocks look like a minefield to be avoided.
''The move to cash is symptomatic of a broader concern about growth and the stock market,'' said Mike Ryan, chief investment strategist at UBS Wealth Management Americas. ''It's all part of a generic derisking exercise.''
Tom Forester, chief investment officer for the Forester Value Fund, based in Lake Forest, Ill., summed up the situation more succinctly. ''Cash doesn't go down,'' he said.
Mr. Forester said he was shifting assets into a money-market fund that invests in Treasury notes. For other institutional investors, even money market funds seemed risky, and they instead sought the security of cash invested in commercial bank accounts.
The huge buildup in cash does not suggest that the world financial system is on the brink of another Lehman-like panic. But it does underscore the broader economic challenges facing both the United States and Europe, particularly the fear and uncertainty that has taken hold among companies, financial institutions and individuals.
Many companies are holding off on investing in new capacity and creating new jobs, instead stockpiling cash in case of another panic. And banks on both sides of the Atlantic are cautious about lending, restricting the money available to both businesses and consumers. Finally, individuals are clamping down on spending, too. Consumer spending in June dropped for the first time in nearly two years, according to government data announced earlier this week.
At the height of the uncertainty over whether the debt ceiling would be raised and with a potential default in the offing, in late July, investors pulled out more than $100 billion from money market funds and put much of it into banks, lifting fears that the funds could see a run that resembled the one after Lehman Brothers' collapse in 2008.
Since the beginning of this year through July 20th, holdings of cash in United States commercial banks surged 85 percent, or $912.7 billion, to $1.98 trillion, according to the Federal Reserve.
In a sign of just how much cash had poured into commercial bank accounts, Bank of New York Mellon said on Thursday that it would charge institutional clients with more than $50 million on deposit a fee of 13 basis points. The move is intended to recover some of the cost of managing the money, but is also a bid to slow the so-called hot money that has been ricocheting between Treasuries, money-market funds and pure cash balances at the big banks.
The Bank of New York Mellon said the fee would only be applied ''to a small number of institutional clients with extraordinarily high deposit levels where the deposits have increased significantly in recent weeks, well above market trends.'' The bank did not disclose just how much cash had poured into its coffers recently.
Over all, banks took in nearly $200 billion between mid-June and mid-July as institutional investors fled money market accounts and sought the safety of accounts protected by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, according to Joseph Abate, a money market strategist at Barclays Capital.
While its rivals have not yet announced similar moves, the Bank of New York's charges are likely to force cash out of banks and back into money market funds and Treasuries, driving rates even lower where possible, Mr. Abate said in a note to investors Thursday.
''The movement into deposits during a financial crisis is expensive for U.S. banks because they have to pay deposit insurance on these extra inflows,'' Mr. Abate wrote. ''These inflows mostly represent 'hot money.' ''
There are signs that money market funds are beginning to regain some of their appeal now that the debt ceiling has been raised and as stocks swoon.
Amid the decline on Wall Street and approval of the debt ceiling increase this week, $13.1 billion went back into money market funds on Tuesday and Wednesday, said Peter Crane, the president of Crane Data, which tracks money market mutual fund flows. Data for Thursday was not in yet, but Mr. Crane said he expected this trend to continue in the coming days.
''Bad news for everyone else is good news for money market funds,'' he said.
That is certainly why they appeal to Mr. Forester. He has been building up his cash position for weeks, he said, selling shares of past winners like I.B.M. and Honeywell.
The weak growth in gross domestic product in the first half of 2011, a figure released by the government last Friday, only confirmed his doubts, he said. Now, Mr. Forester's cash position in his $210 million stock fund equals 22 percent of assets, about double the average since he started the fund 11 years ago.
''You do this ahead of time, you don't do it when the world's falling apart,'' he said. ''We've seen a lot of this coming.''

HEADLINE: Before a Walk Across the Falls, A Balancing Act

BYLINE: By THOMAS KAPLAN

 BODY:
NIAGARA FALLS, Ontario -- Nik Wallenda is a seventh-generation circus performer, scion of the famed Flying Wallendas. He set the world record for farthest distance traveled by bicycle on a high wire. And now he has set his sights on a new deed of daredevilry -- walking the 1,800 feet across the gorge of Niagara Falls while balancing on a two-inch-diameter steel cable.
But before he can attempt his funambulist feat, Mr. Wallenda must persuade officials in both Canada and the United States to abandon their century-old aversion to ''stunting'' as a distraction from the majesty of the falls. So for several days, Mr. Wallenda has been attempting his own form of tightrope diplomacy, shuttling across the falls and meeting with lawmakers and parks overseers in both countries as he pleads for support.
''This is a dream of mine that I've always wanted to do,'' Mr. Wallenda, a 32-year-old father of three, said on Thursday, sitting on the pool deck of a hotel here and surveying the waterworks in the distance. ''I get chills thinking about it.'' 
In the United States, a long list of local politicians, eager to help the economically depressed city of Niagara Falls, N.Y., have championed his proposal: lawmakers in Albany voted this year to give permission for Mr. Wallenda's escapade, and that measure will soon come before Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo for his consideration.
''We have to keep Niagara Falls fresh,'' said John Percy, who as president of the Niagara Tourism and Convention Corporation is the top tourism official on the American side of the falls. ''From a destination marketer's standpoint, we want this to happen, because it just garners worldwide attention.''
But in Canada -- where Niagara Falls, Ontario, is booming as a casino-enriched tourist metropolis that has been developed over decades -- parks officials are frowning on what they see as a falls folly, citing a 19th-century crackdown on stunt acts.
''Our vision is to have people come and be inspired by the falls, by the beauty of the natural environment,'' the interim chairwoman of the Niagara Parks Commission, Janice Thomson, said in an interview. ''We don't believe that stunting has any place in front of that natural splendor.''
Niagara Falls has a long history of attracting stuntmen, and stuntwomen, eager to taste the thrill, and the fame, of plunging over the cascade packed into wine barrels, rubber inner tubes or hot water tanks. Annie Taylor, a 63-year-old schoolteacher, pioneered the barrel plunge in 1901 and lived to tell about it. Other daredevils followed; not everyone fared as well.
But tightrope walking has an even longer history here. Jean Francois Gravelet, known as the Great Blondin, crossed the gorge on a wire in 1859 and repeated his feat as a regular attraction at the falls. On occasion, Blondin would wear a sack over his head, or push a wheelbarrow, or even carry his business manager. In one variant of his act, he donned a chef's hat and stopped above the gorge to cook an omelet for passengers on the Maid of the Mist sightseeing boat, bobbing in the waters beneath him.
But the Niagara Parks Commission, the Canadian agency that oversees the parkland adjacent to the falls, traces its creation in 1885 to the desire of local officials to reduce the ''increasingly carnival atmosphere'' at the falls. Even though the mayor of Niagara Falls, Ontario, is a Wallenda supporter, the Parks Commission prohibits ''stunting'' at the falls, and holds that rule near and dear.
Mr. Wallenda, who wants to walk across the gorge in front of the Horseshoe Falls, met with the general manager of the Parks Commission on Thursday in a session he described as friendly and positive.
''It was just, 'Hey, this is who I am, I'm a real person, I'm not cocky, I'm not crazy, I'm not a maniac,' '' he said. '' 'I'm a real person, I respect you 100 percent, I respect your country, I respect your laws, I'm going to abide by your laws, and together, I think we can accomplish something amazing.' ''
After the meeting, the Parks Commission released a statement saying that it invited Mr. Wallenda to submit a written proposal, which would then be reviewed ''to ensure it meets the best interests of the park.''
The commission, its statement said, ''requested the proposal address its concern over the possibility such a feat would encourage others to try and undertake possible stunting activities.''
The disagreement reflects the diverging paths of the two cities that flank the falls.
Niagara Falls, N.Y., is a shell of a city: the stucco exteriors of low-rise motels wear the stains of neglect; paint peels on old bungalows, their porches sagging; and weeds poke through the cracks of downtown sidewalks. The falls, once a default honeymoon destination, have clearly lost some of the cultural cachet from 1953, when Marilyn Monroe starred in a thriller set here, ''Niagara.''
The city, like other Rust Belt communities, has steadily decayed as factory jobs vanished. Barely 50,000 people live there today, down from 102,000 in 1960. And tourism has not been as strong as the city's boosters wish, despite repeated efforts to promote the falls, most recently as a wedding destination for same-sex couples.
Mr. Wallenda is arguing that his tightrope walk would provide an economic stimulus for this area, with the only cost being the suspense of watching him.
''Talk to any local business owner here, far and wide -- they'll tell you, the falls need a boost,'' Mr. Wallenda said. ''It's about bringing attention to this region, which helps the economy, which is what we're all trying to do in this day and age.''
In June, New York State lawmakers approved a bill written specifically to allow the stunt, which the bill's sponsors promised would give Niagara Falls ''a much-needed shot in the arm in terms of economic development.''
The legislation would require state parks officials to grant Mr. Wallenda permission to walk across the falls, but would also require him to pick up all safety costs, and would bar him from suing New York State should he be injured or die.
On Thursday, at a Niagara Falls, N.Y., souvenir shop housing a ''daredevil museum,'' two visitors, Kim Walker, 50, a Pennsylvania homemaker, and Deanna Meadows, 49, who works for a lawyer in Texas, eyed some of the contraptions that had previously carried people over the falls, including a steel tank turned into a craft for two people (they lived) and a mangled Jet Ski (he did not).
They offered a fatalistic endorsement of Mr. Wallenda. ''If he falls, it's not going to ruin the falls,'' Ms. Meadows said. ''I mean, it's not going to mess them up. It's going to mess him up.''
Mark DiFrancesco, 51, who runs the souvenir shop with his brother, said it was about time for another high-wire act.
''It just gets everybody excited again,'' he said. ''No matter how you look at it, whether you like it or you don't like it, it is part of the history of Niagara Falls.''

HEADLINE: Stocks in Worst Tumble in 2 Years Amid Global Worry

BYLINE: By GRAHAM BOWLEY; Reporting was contributed by Nelson D. Schwartz, Clifford Krauss, Mark Landler, Motoko Rich and Bettina Wassener.

 BODY:
What began as a weak day in the stock markets ended in the worst rout in more than two years, as investors dumped stocks amid anxiety that both Europe and the United States were failing to fix deepening economic problems.
With a steep decline of around 5 percent in the United States on Thursday, stocks have now fallen nearly 11 percent in two weeks. Markets have been plunging as investors sought safer havens for their money -- including Treasury bonds, which some had been avoiding during the debate over extending the nation's debt ceiling.
Sparking the drop was an unsuccessful effort by the European Central Bank to reassure the markets, which instead ended up spooking investors. The bank intervened with a show of support to buy bonds of some smaller countries, but not Italy and Spain, whose mounting troubles have come into the spotlight. This was taken as a sign that the recent rescue packages by Europe could soon be overwhelmed by the huge debt burdens in those two countries. 
Investors were further unnerved by a candid remark by Jose Manuel Barroso, the European Commission president, who seemed to confirm fears about the sense of political paralysis. Rather than play down the problems, as European officials have done since the debt crisis began last year, he said, ''Markets remain to be convinced that we are taking the appropriate steps to resolve the crisis.''
With investors in the United States already focusing anew on fragile economic growth and high unemployment, waves of selling of stocks began in Europe and continued throughout the day in the United States. Analysts said the market still might have further to fall, as investors reassess the dimming economic prospects. In the short run, attention will be focused on critical unemployment numbers for July to be released on Friday morning. And some in the markets are already questioning whether the Federal Reserve has done enough to mend the economy and whether it could soon take further steps to stimulate growth.
On Thursday, more than 14 billion shares changed hands, the heaviest selling in more than a year. In addition to being unnerved by weaker economic data reported in recent days, investors appeared to lose their optimism about the strength of corporate profits that had driven increases in the stock market in the first half of this year.
At the close, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index was down 60.27 points, or 4.78 percent, to 1,200.07. The Dow Jones industrial average was off 512.76 points, or 4.31 percent, to 11,383.68, and the Nasdaq was down 136.68, or 5.08 percent, to 2,556.39.
The S.& P. 500 has now fallen 10.7 percent from 1,345 on July 22, underlining the new negative investment sentiment about the economy and about Europe.
''We are now in correction mode,'' said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at Standard & Poor's. ''We could have another couple of weeks to go before it bottoms.''
The last time the market was in a correction was last summer, when it fell 16 percent before recovering.
Analysts said credit markets were still healthy and the United States was now stronger than just a few years ago so that a repeat of the financial crisis was unlikely.
''There is a huge difference -- during the financial crisis the banking sector broke down. Right now it's a crisis of confidence based on weak economies but the banking sector is not broken,'' said Reena Aggarwal, professor of finance at Georgetown University.
The Vix, which measures the implied volatility of options on the S.& P. 500 index, and is called the fear index by traders, spiked on Thursday, though it is still much lower than during the depths of the financial crisis in 2008.
Washington's reaction to the market's tumble was muted. The Treasury Department said it did not plan to issue any statements or provide officials to comment.
''Markets go up and down,'' said the White House spokesman, Jay Carney. ''We obviously are monitoring the situation in Europe closely.''
As the prospects for economic growth dimmed, several commodities, including oil, silver and palladium, fell by more than 5 percent, perhaps producing some good news for consumers.
With oil prices dropping below $87 a barrel, wiping out the rise caused by unrest in the Middle East and North Africa earlier in the year, drivers can expect sharply lower gasoline prices just in time for the Labor Day weekend and back-to-school shopping.
Agricultural crops and most industrial metals fell somewhat less drastically, with copper falling 1.9 percent, aluminum by 1.7 percent, corn by 1.9 percent, wheat by 3.4 percent and soybeans by 1.8 percent.
Taken together, the drops should mean lower input costs for manufacturers and give the Federal Reserve more policy options should the economy continue to slow.
A closely-watched survey of American investor attitudes provided by the American Association of Individual investors on Thursday showed the biggest increase in bearish sentiment for five years in the latest week. As investors fled assets like stocks, they piled into the perceived safety of United States Treasuries where 10-year interest rates fell to 2.41 percent, recording the biggest one day fall since March 2009.
Yields on one-month United States notes actually fell into negative territory before closing at zero.
Besides piling into Treasuries, institutional investors are also seeking out the safety of cold, hard cash, pouring billions into commercial bank accounts backed up by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. Investors had also been buying Swiss francs and Japanese yen. But earlier this week, Switzerland unexpectedly cut interest rates in an effort to weaken the franc. Japan on Thursday also intervened to weaken its currency, raising the specter that more nations could take similar steps to try to protect their economies.
Around the world, markets from Brazil to Turkey were battered.
In Britain, stocks closed down 3.43 percent. In Germany, the DAX index dropped 3.4 percent. In France, the CAC 40 closed down 3.9 percent.
''It really is Europe today,'' said Barry Knapp, head of United States equity strategy at Barclays Capital. ''The market feels that European leaders are one step behind, and they are.''
Asian markets quickly followed suit in trading lower. In midday trading on Friday, the Nikkei 225 in Japan was down 3.47 percent to 9,312.22 while the S.& P./ASX 200 index in Australia fell 3.98 percent to 4,106.40. The Hang Seng index in Hong Kong opened sharply lower as well, and was down 4.6 percent to 20,865.95 by midday.
With some warning signs that weaker European banks are struggling to fund themselves, the central bank moved to help weaker banks by expanding its lending to institutions in the euro zone. Bank stocks nevertheless fell sharply in Europe.
In the United States, as the stock market fell, it broke through critical support levels, leading to more selling as traders rushed to reduce exposure to plummeting prices. That included computerized program traders, one analyst said.

HEADLINE: Another Musical Post Is Vacated at City Ballet

BYLINE: By JAMES R. OESTREICH

 BODY:
The music staff of the New York City Opera continues to dwindle. Kevin Murphy, a widely respected vocal coach, said on Thursday that he would leave his position as the company's director of music administration to take a faculty post at the Indiana University School of Music this fall. 
The news came just two days after George Steel, City Opera's general manager and artistic director, revealed that the position of music director, now occupied by the conductor George Manahan, would be eliminated next season.
Mr. Murphy, 46, is married to the noted soprano Heidi Grant Murphy, who will join him on the Indiana faculty. Mr. Murphy will be a full-time professor, coaching and overseeing opera studies within the school's vocal program. Ms. Murphy will be an adjunct professor, teaching voice and directing graduate opera workshops, while maintaining a performing career.
At Mr. Steel's request Mr. Murphy has agreed to retain a tie with City Opera as a casting adviser, joining Steven Blier, the artistic director of the New York Festival of Song, who now holds that title.
Mr. Murphy joined the company in 2008 -- during the brief tenure of Gerard Mortier, with whom he had worked at the Paris Opera -- and remained in place when Mr. Steel took over as manager in 2009. The Steel years, coinciding with an economic recession, have so far been marked by austere programming (some five productions a season), staff cuts and, recently, turmoil surrounding the company's decision to leave Lincoln Center.
Mr. Murphy declined to discuss his departure in terms of the recent upheaval.
''I'd like to keep it in a positive light,'' he said from Chicago, where he was preparing for another new appointment, as director of the vocal program at the Steans Music Institute of the Ravinia Festival.
''This is really a wonderful opportunity for both of us,'' Mr. Murphy said, ''and it comes at a good time for our family.''
Mr. Steel said in a statement: ''Kevin is one of the most skilled and talented arts professionals in opera, and has been a brilliant and delightful colleague. Together with Steven Blier, he has been an essential part of New York City Opera's casting team, so I am very pleased he has agreed to continue with us as a casting adviser.''

CORRECTION-DATE: August 6, 2011

 CORRECTION:
A headline on Friday with an article about the departure of Kevin Murphy, a vocal coach, from an arts organization in New York misidentified the organization. It is New York City Opera, not City Ballet. The article also misstated the year Mr. Murphy joined City Opera. It was 2008, not 2007. And the article referred imprecisely to some of Mr. Murphy's duties in his new post, at the Indiana University School of Music, where he will be a professor. He will oversee opera studies within the school's vocal program, not the entire vocal program.

HEADLINE: Hope and Doubt Over a City Effort to Aid Black and Latino Men

BYLINE: By ADRIANE QUINLAN

 BODY:
The problems that face young black and Latino men in New York City are deep-seated and diverse, officials who work in minority neighborhoods say. They vary not only from neighborhood to neighborhood, but also from family to family and man to man.
So when Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg announced on Thursday a $130 million plan to help young black and Latino men find jobs, raise families and stay out of trouble, those men -- and the mentors who would help them -- were tentatively happy, but raised some questions. 
''I'm glad to see somebody's actually mentioning the words 'young men' and 'color' in the same sentence as 'funding,' '' said Danny R. Peralta, director for arts and education at The Point Community Development Corporation in the Bronx.
Still, Mr. Peralta worried that the money would just graze the surface of the problem. ''If you can't wake up in the morning to some food or if you can't get some counseling for whatever traumas you've been experiencing,'' he said, ''it is not going to reach you.''
Lee Cabrera, 23, holding his son as he looked out on a courtyard in the Harlem River Houses development, said, ''There are a lot of homeless kids out there right now.'' With three children under 6 and a fourth on the way, Mr. Cabrera said looking for a job was the last thing on his mind. Would Mr. Bloomberg's plan help him raise his family?
Young fathers like Mr. Cabrera face the double challenge of supporting themselves and creating an environment that keeps their children out of trouble. Odane Andrews, 22, has a 6-month-old son in Virginia, but because he is looking for work, he has not seen the child for two months. ''I don't know when I might get a call back,'' he said, adding that, even with a G.E.D. and a job-training program under his belt, he still lived with his mother.
City financing for training programs and recruitment centers might be good, Mr. Andrews said, but ''all the opportunities they say are out there are not as easy to get; there's always a catch.''
Damichael Jones, 20, ran into one of those catches. He said that he had finished serving a three-year prison sentence in May, and that even with programs like an intensive job-training course at the Center for Employment Opportunities in Manhattan, which he was planning to attend, he thought it would be hard to persuade employers to hire a felon. ''If you have a felony, you can't get a job,'' he said. ''The only thing holding me back is me.''
The challenge is not just finding employment for these young men, said Ernest Johnson, the senior director of support services at Strive, a group based in East Harlem that offers job-training programs: Officials may have to start by changing public perceptions. A locksmith training program Mr. Johnson ran years ago failed because customers did not trust the men who came to help them. ''They didn't want people 20 years old changing the locks at their house,'' he said.
Mr. Peralta said that while money for job programs was good, the roots of the problem were deeper. For instance, at The Point Community Development Corporation, many young people were trained to install environmentally friendly roofs but left unemployed because of the recession. ''There's no construction happening in the Bronx,'' he said. ''So I have several young people trained to do this work that's not even realistic.''
Even when there are job opportunities, many employers are more eager to hire women than men. Elizabeth C. Yeampierre, the executive director of the United Puerto Rican Organization of Sunset Park in Brooklyn, said that in her experience, young women were quickly hired to work at cash registers, but men were hired less often. When they were hired, she said, it was for lower-paid stock positions.
''Girls are hired for the wrong reason: because they're cute,'' Ms. Yeampierre said. ''The boys are hired to do stock, not cash registers, because they're not trusted.''
Even so, Redell Ferguson, 26, who works as a manager at a sporting goods store, said the mayor's program might help men who were down on their luck. ''People can only better themselves if you help them,'' he said.
Ms. Yeampierre said, ''We can't have a cookie-cutter approach.'' She added that she was pleased about Mr. Bloomberg's initiative, as her organization is seeking financing for a program that teaches young Puerto Rican men leadership skills and encourages them to change their perceptions of masculinity. But she worried it might lump together people with different needs.
Mr. Peralta agreed, saying young people would not follow programs that told them what to do without addressing the problems they face on the ground. ''How do we work with them to work on their own needs?'' he said. ''Without that autonomy, that's not going to work. You're going to pigeonhole them.''
Asked what his dream job was, Mr. Andrews, the father who had not seen his son for two months, paused. ''To be honest with you,'' he said, ''I don't think I have one anymore.''

HEADLINE: A First Lady Who Has Avoided the Spotlight Now Faces an Even Bigger One

BYLINE: By MORGAN SMITH. 
msmith@texastribune.org

 BODY:
Anita Perry first entered the national consciousness as the spur to her husband's possible presidential run. But a different theme emerges when friends and associates talk about the wife of Texas' governor: she is not the type to draw attention to herself.
Instead, they say, she is a woman who immediately sets at ease the survivors of sexual assault she works with; who knows how to tell a humorous anecdote about her husband; and who never turns up at her dress designer's studio without a book that is perfect for his 4-year-old.
Mrs. Perry grew up as the daughter of a country doctor in a place where, as she has fondly recalled, freezers were piled high with casseroles for neighbors in need. Behind her small-town reserve is also a woman who encouraged her husband to get out of his ''comfort zone'' -- and run for president.
''She is a quiet, strong, feminine force,'' said Mica Mosbacher, a prominent Republican donor who became acquainted with Mrs. Perry six years ago through her work for the Texas Association Against Sexual Assault. Mrs. Perry declined to be interviewed for this article. 
When Mrs. Perry learned that Mrs. Mosbacher had been sexually assaulted during college, the first lady approached her to see if she would help the association raise money in the Houston area. Mrs. Mosbacher said she was struck with the warmth Mrs. Perry displayed when she broached the difficult topic.
''You could tell she was more interested in me, and my comfort with the situation, rather than asking something of me,'' Mrs. Mosbacher said.
When Rick Perry, who was first elected a state representative in 1984, took his first statewide office in 1991 as agriculture commissioner, Mrs. Perry moved to Austin with their two young children, Griffin and Sydney. She left her post as director of nurses at Haskell Memorial Hospital, where she oversaw a newly established rape crisis program.
Less than a decade later, she became first lady of Texas. She shared many similarities with Laura Bush, said Pamela Willeford, who served as ambassador to Switzerland and Lichtenstein during the second Bush administration and has worked with both women.
They both carried into the role long-held interests, she said -- reading and literacy for Mrs. Bush and health care for Mrs. Perry -- and became known for their graciousness.
''They both had their own style,'' she said. ''But with grace and determination and toughness, they highlighted things that are important to Texas and to them.''
Since the 1991 move, Mrs. Perry's professional life has been defined by her husband's political career. But before he became governor, her work as a consultant for the economist Ray Perryman brought in a substantial chunk of the family's income. In 2001, The Houston Chronicle reported that the governor's tax returns showed her work at the Perryman Group -- whose clients included Philip Morris, Dell and the Texas Farm Bureau -- brought in $66,000 of the family's $138,115 annual earnings in 2000. Mrs. Perry quit the job when Mr. Perry became governor.
When she began fund-raising and development work as a contract employee for the Texas Association Against Sexual Assault in 2003, Mrs. Perry became the first Texas governor's wife in remembered history to have a paid job outside her role as first lady. She told The San Antonio Express-News then that the job helped defray her children's college expenses and to occupy ''the more hours in the day'' she had as a recent empty-nester.
The job at the assault association was a natural fit for a first lady who had by then begun to focus on women and children's health care issues. Though she drew on those experiences, she was careful to stay away from the organization's public policy arm because of her husband's office, said Chris Lippincott, who shared an office with her there for three years as public relations director.
''She was somebody who is as warm and caring as she was thorough and professional,'' he said. ''In that field, both are important; both matter to people.''
Mr. Lippincott, a longtime Democrat, said his and Mrs. Perry's mutual love of college sports grew into a friendship that transcended party boundaries. ''I never voted for Rick Perry, and I don't think I ever will,'' he said. ''But I count his wife as a friend.''
As in her work with the association, Mrs. Perry carefully avoids any public indication of divergence with her husband on political issues. During the 2010 gubernatorial race, when The Houston Chronicle asked her if there were any areas where she and her husband had different opinions, she said, ''Any two people are bound to disagree on at least a few small issues, and we are no different.''
That comment characterizes much of Mrs. Perry's tenure as first lady -- down to earth, but cut with a cautious political sense she has had reason to refine throughout her husband's time as the state's chief executive.
When Mr. Perry signed an ill-fated executive order in 2007 requiring all sixth-grade girls to receive a vaccine to prevent the human papillomavirus, a sexually transmitted disease linked to cervical cancer, observers pointed to her influence. After outrage from all quarters -- social conservatives argued it encouraged teenage sex, while ethics watchdogs questioned a former Perry staff member's work as a lobbyist for the vaccine maker, Merck -- lawmakers voted to block it.
In 2004, she felt forced to respond publicly to rumors of her husband's infidelity and gossip that her marriage was in trouble. ''It's very sad that some people believe that spreading false, vicious and hurtful rumors is acceptable behavior,'' she said in a statement at the time. The rumors, which were never substantiated, have been revisited in national news media coverage of Mr. Perry's prospective presidential bid.
It is a good thing that Mrs. Perry has had the practice: after the challenges of more than 25 years as a political spouse, she appears poised to enter a much brighter spotlight.
Soon Mrs. Perry will take on yet another role: that of ambassador for her home state -- and her husband. In that regard, she has an example in Lady Bird Johnson, who entered the White House during a particular low point in sentiment about Texas after a popular president was assassinated in Dallas.
''She didn't apologize for being a Texan'' but reached out to her opponents, said Jan Jarboe Russell, a Johnson biographer. In the coming political spotlight, she said, Mrs. Perry has the opportunity to, like Mrs. Johnson, ''defend us and put the best face forward for Texas and serve as a foil to some of the more negative aspects'' of Mr. Perry's ''and our caricature.''

HEADLINE: Governing The City By Writing A Check

BYLINE: By MICHAEL POWELL. 
E-mail: powellm@nytimes.com

 BODY:
It began years ago as a toss-off laugh line in City Hall's marble halls: Hizzoner, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, might consider solving his most intractable problems with a quick tap-tap-tap on his personal savings account.
Except, slowly but surely, Mayor Daddy Warbucks has converted that punch line into unprecedented reality. He offered the city he rules a gilded two-shot this week. 
He cajoled five of his impossibly wealthy peers to help him foot the cost of the midyear Regents examination, so that several thousand high school seniors could graduate on time.
In a far grander move, the mayor put $30 million of his own philanthropic stash -- along with $30 million more from that liberal Croesus George Soros -- into an ambitious and indisputably compelling effort. He would reel in the tens of thousand of young black and Latino men who drift far from the shores of steady work and toward prison and dysfunction.
As our nation takes a long trek through a deep recessionary canyon, no group has suffered more brutally than black men, for whom unemployment now sits just below 20 percent. Those who might be expected to offer succor, from President Obama to the Senate and the Tea Partying House, talk, more or less endlessly, about debt ceilings and deficit reduction.
So Mr. Bloomberg's words and actions fall as water onto parched soil.
''Even though skin color in America no longer determines a child's fate, sadly, it tells us far more about a child's future than it should,'' he said Thursday. ''How could we possibly tell them that when they get older they are far more likely than their peers to become violent criminals -- or the victims of violent crimes?''
And yet you cannot write of this mayor and his good works without reckoning with his personal and policy contradictions, and with the questions that might be raised about government by personal checkbook.
This same mayor runs a police department that stops and frisks record numbers of black and Latino men -- half a million each year, sometimes at gunpoint. I recall sitting on a bench at York College several years ago, interviewing 20 black male students. All had been stopped by the police, and although the vast majority had committed no offense, they suffered the indignity of being treated as if they had.
And that same police force arrests more people, most of those blacks and Latinos, for marijuana possession than any city in the world. Mayoral aides protest, reasonably, that 90 percent of those arrested for marijuana do not end up with felonies. But these men will feel the slap of handcuffs and stand in stinking precinct holding cells, even as their white peers smoke more but rarely get arrested.
THERE is, too, the question of Mr. Bloomberg's billions and the thin membrane between philanthropy and mayoral advantage. Patricia E. Harris, for instance, wears a broad hat as chairwoman and chief executive of the mayor's $1.75 billion charity. And she dons a perhaps more modest chapeau as his first deputy mayor.
Will she, as philanthropic doyenne, play a role in overseeing and monitoring this program? Even aides weren't certain of the answer.
Over the decade that Mr. Bloomberg has ruled, many nonprofits, including neighborhood dance programs and such august worthies as the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the Doe Fund for homeless men, have benefited from the mayor's largess. He is a generous man, and most often behaves well.
Slowly, almost imperceptibly, however, many groups have become outcroppings of Bloomberg Politics Inc. When the mayor was in need of witnesses to pipe up about revoking term limits at a City Council hearing, the sound heard offstage was of nonprofit leaders tripping over themselves in the dash to the podium. Aides protest that this phenomenon is entirely voluntary -- they simply love this man.
Conflict of interest? With just the barest tinge of irony, City Hall aides suggest a correction: It's a conflict of benefit.
Yet here's the rub. We live in straitened times. Those Regents tests were tossed aside by state legislators who cut taxes and then lacked the gumption or the creativity to find enough money. A few thousand teenagers might not have graduated on time, and a few hundred of those might have found themselves on the hot asphalt streets of summer with few prospects and too much idle time.
Which is another way of beginning to describe those young men the mayor spoke of so eloquently.
''As a general rule, public programs should be funded with public money,'' noted Raymond Horton, a Columbia professor who has analyzed the city for many decades. ''But Bloomberg's leadership on this issue at this time is so needed. And the sums are not small.''
Some complain the mayor was late to the problem of young black and Latino men. Councilwoman Letitia James of Brooklyn speaks, quite eloquently, of going year after year to funerals for young black men slain by other young black men. Where was the mayor years ago?
Perhaps this is so, though that indictment could be brought against most elected officials in this nation. And New York, historically and today, puts more money into creating health and recreation programs, and tens of thousands of units of housing, than in most cities.
Deputy Mayor Linda I. Gibbs, who deserves credit along with Andrea Batista Schlesinger for developing this initiative, says the mayor's foundation money was plowed into programs that promised the quickest payoff. Cut by 5 percent the number of teenagers who file into juvenile halls and jails, at ruinous expense to the taxpayer, and you quickly save tens of millions of dollars.
City dollars, by contrast, will go into longer-term programs of less certain direct payoff.
''This isn't a cure-all,'' she said. ''Some of these initiatives will work better than others.''
She has been at poverty work a bit too long to promise miracles. But in lean, even terrible, economic times, it would be a strange beggar who turns away a wealthy man's money.

HEADLINE: U.S. Taking Step To Open Drilling In Arctic Ocean

BYLINE: By JOHN M. BRODER and CLIFFORD KRAUSS; John M. Broder reported from Washington, and Clifford Krauss from Houston.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The Department of the Interior on Thursday granted Royal Dutch Shell conditional approval of its plan to begin drilling exploratory wells in the Arctic Ocean next summer, a strong sign that the Obama administration is easing a regulatory clampdown on offshore oil drilling that it imposed after last year's deadly accident in the Gulf of Mexico.
The move confirms a willingness by President Obama to approve expanded domestic oil and gas exploration in response to high gasoline prices and continuing high levels of unemployment. It comes as the issuing of drilling permits in the gulf is quickening, including the granting on Thursday of a permit for a Shell floating drill rig for a 4,000-foot-deep well. That means that that all five of its rigs there will be back to work after a long drilling halt. 
The decision to tentatively approve Shell's plan to drill four exploratory wells in the Beaufort Sea off the North Slope of Alaska represents a major step in the company's efforts to exploit the vast oil and gas resources under the Arctic Ocean, although some hurdles remain.
The company has spent nearly $4 billion and more than five years trying to win the right to drill in the frigid waters, against the opposition of many environmental advocates and of Alaska natives who depend on the sea for their livelihoods.
Opponents say the harsh conditions there heighten the dangers of drilling and make cleaning up any potential spill vastly more complicated than in the comparatively benign waters of the gulf.
Administration officials cautioned that the company must win a number of secondary permits before it can begin punching holes in the seabed. The plan approved Thursday, considered the overarching one, contains detailed information on how the company would respond to any blowout and spill.
''We base our decisions regarding energy exploration and development in the Arctic on the best scientific information available,'' said Michael R. Bromwich, director of the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, Regulation and Enforcement, which oversees offshore drilling. ''We will closely review and monitor Shell's proposed activities to ensure that any activities that take place under this plan will be conducted in a safe and environmentally responsible manner.''
Shell enthusiastically welcomed the decision. ''We feel very good about it,'' said Pete Slaiby, Shell's vice president in Alaska. ''It's one of the road marks we wanted to see. It makes us very happy.''
But the announcement only partly smooths the rocky relations between the administration and the oil industry, with the president remaining committed to repealing $4 billion in annual oil company tax breaks. The administration has also been wary of encouraging the industry's aggressive plans to drill in shale oil and gas fields across the country because of concerns about potential drinking water contamination.
''This strikes me as a shift back to the track that the administration was on prior to last year's oil spill,'' said Michael A. Levi, an energy and environment fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations. ''It seems the lesson that the administration took is that offshore drilling needs to be regulated better and done better, not that it shouldn't be done at all.''
The plan is almost certain to face legal challenges.
''No drill bits are going to hit the Arctic seafloor until at least one and probably several courts have reviewed this plan,'' said Brendan Cummings, senior counsel at the Center for Biological Diversity, which is already suing to stop drilling in the Chukchi Sea west of Alaska. ''From the perspective of ocean drilling and climate, it's hard to see a difference between this administration and the last one.''
Shell still needs to win approval of its drilling plan for the Chukchi Sea, which is west of the Beaufort Sea and more remote.
The company has proposed drilling four wells at a depth of approximately 160 feet of water about 20 miles from shore in the Beaufort Sea. The BP well that exploded in the gulf in April 2010 was at a depth of more than 5,000 feet and 40 miles from the Louisiana coast. The accident killed 11 workers and spilled nearly five million barrels of oil into the gulf.
Energy experts and industry executives said the move on Thursday reflected a partial warming of relations between the oil industry and Obama administration since the BP disaster.
''I don't know if I would call them friends yet, but I look at this as a step in the right direction,'' said Craig T. Castille, operations manager for deepwater projects at Stone Energy, who added that the permit process in the Gulf of Mexico remained slower than the industry would like.
Shell has spent years trying to convince federal regulators and several courts that it can drill safely in the Arctic, and every year one hurdle or another has stood in its way.
Shell has already invested nearly $4 billion on its 10-year offshore leases and preparations for exploration in the forbidding Chukchi and Beaufort Seas. Its current plan is to drill up to 10 exploratory wells in the two seas, potentially leading to production by the end of the decade.
Shell has been obliged over the years to tighten its spill response plan, especially since the BP accident at the Macondo well in the gulf. It is proposing to use two drill ships in the Arctic, each capable of drilling a relief well for the other; to put an extra set of shears on its blowout preventers; and to keep emergency capping systems near drill sites to capture any leaks.
The Alaskan Arctic may hold 27 billion barrels of oil, enough to fuel 25 million cars for 35 years. But environmentalists warn that a spill in the Arctic would be more catastrophic than the Gulf of Mexico accident was because the Alaskan waters are dark and inaccessible, and because they are vital breeding grounds for many aquatic species that are endangered or at risk.
Marilyn Heiman, director of the Pew Environment Group's Arctic program, said that the region was the harshest area in the world in which to drill for oil, as well as a delicate habitat for a variety of sea mammals. The proposed well sites are subject to fierce winds and high seas in the fall and lie hundreds of miles from the nearest Coast Guard stations.
''Hard questions need to be asked about any oil company's ability to mount a response to a major oil spill in hurricane-force winds, high seas, broken and shifting sea ice, subzero temperatures, and months of fog and darkness,'' Ms. Heiman said in an e-mail from Alaska.

HEADLINE: European Central Bank Buys Bonds to Reassure the Markets, to Little Avail

BYLINE: By JACK EWING and MATTHEW SALTMARSH; Jack Ewing reported from Frankfurt and Matthew Saltmarsh from London. Julia Werdigier contributed reporting from London and Rachel Donadio from Rome.

 BODY:
FRANKFURT -- Once again seeking to calm market tension, the European Central Bank intervened unexpectedly in bond markets on Thursday in an effort to prevent the region's debt crisis from engulfing Italy.
The show of force initially bolstered Italian and Spanish bonds. But the move appeared to backfire as stock markets in Europe and the United States fell sharply after Jean-Claude Trichet, the central bank's president, warned of dangers ahead, while the modest scale of the bank's bond-buying apparently fell short of what investors considered adequate.
Compounding the tension, a top European official said that a deal reached two weeks ago to ease the debt crisis was not working and urged leaders to consider bolstering the region's existing bailout fund.
European leaders decided last month to authorize the European Financial Stability Facility -- the European Union's bailout fund -- to buy bonds in open markets, relieving the central bank of that responsibility. But it will take months before the rescue fund is able to start making purchases. In addition, European leaders did not increase the size of the fund, leaving questions about whether it would be up to the task if a country as big as Italy or Spain needed help. 
The European Commission president, Jose Manuel Barroso, has been pushing euro zone leaders to do more. In a letter released Thursday, he called for a ''rapid reassessment of all elements'' related to the stability fund, so that it was ''equipped with the means for dealing with contagious risk.''
He also criticized European politicians for ''the undisciplined communication and the complexity and incompleteness'' of the package agreed to at the summit meeting on July 21.
''Markets remain to be convinced that we are taking the appropriate steps to resolve the crisis,'' he wrote. ''Whatever the factors behind the lack of success, it is clear that we are no longer managing a crisis just in the euro area periphery.''
As part of its response to the crisis, the central bank also moved to prop up weaker banks that may be having trouble raising cash, expanding its lending to euro zone institutions at the benchmark interest rate. The central bank left that rate unchanged at 1.5 percent, while the Bank of England left its benchmark rate at a record low of 0.5 percent.
Mr. Trichet declined to say what bonds the bank was buying or how much. He said the bank acted in response to ''renewed tensions in some financial markets in the euro area.'' It was the first such intervention since March.
Traders said the central bank had bought Irish and Portuguese government debt during the day. But the bank did not buy bonds of Italy and Spain, two countries with huge bond markets and now seen as most vulnerable in the region.
The move to buy Portuguese and Irish debt made little sense, given that they are insulated by their official bailouts and no longer have to raise money on the market, said Michael Leister, a fixed-income analyst at WestLB in Dusseldorf, Germany.
Mr. Trichet, however, had ''opened the door to acting on behalf of Spain and Italy,'' he added. The yield on 10-year Italian debt rose 11 basis points, to 6.19 percent. Yields on 10-year Spanish bonds rose three basis points, to 6.28 percent. Earlier, Spain sold 3.3 billion euros, or $4.7 billion, of bonds due in 2014 with demand more than twice the level of supply. But the average yield rose to 4.813 percent from 4.037 percent at a comparable auction in June.
''Over all, sentiment hasn't changed yet,'' Mr. Leister said after the central bank had acted. ''Everyone's afraid that the debt spiral will become a self-fulfilling prophecy. And the E.C.B. is the only institution with the firepower to stop the situation in the short term.''
The central bank first began buying bonds in the open market in May 2010 but tapered off the interventions earlier this year, a move investors may have interpreted as a lack of resolve. Michael T. Darda, chief economist at MKM Partners in Stamford, Conn., warned Thursday that half-hearted forays into the bond market ''will fail, just like they did last year.''
''In each case, the debt crisis got worse instead of better,'' he wrote in a note.
The central bank also responded to signs of stress in interbank markets when institutions, wary of each other's exposure to troubled government paper, became reluctant to lend to each other. One worrisome sign was a surge in the cost at which European banks borrow dollars in the open foreign exchange market.
Mr. Trichet said that next week the central bank would lend banks as much cash as they wanted for six months at the benchmark interest rate, assuming the banks could provide collateral. A six-month term is longer than is customary.
Speaking to reporters Thursday after a regular meeting of the bank's governing council, Mr. Trichet also gave a more subdued view of the European economy.
''As expected, recent economic data indicate a deceleration in the pace of economic growth in the past few months, following the strong growth rate in the first quarter,'' he said. While he expected moderate growth to continue, he said, ''uncertainty is particularly high.''
Nonetheless, some analysts said they still expected the bank to raise its benchmark rate for the 17-nation euro zone again this year, after Mr. Trichet retires at the end of October, handing the presidency to Mario Draghi, the governor of the Bank of Italy. The central bank has raised its main rate in two steps since April, from 1 percent to the current 1.5 percent, in an attempt to head off rising inflation.
''The E.C.B. gave the impression that further rate hikes are necessary,'' Jorg Kramer, chief economist at Commerzbank, said. ''However, the E.C.B. would probably immediately refrain from raising interest rates if the sovereign debt crisis escalated.''
Mr. Trichet beseeched political leaders to speed up efforts to cut their budget deficits and remove impediments to growth, like overly protected labor markets. ''The key for everything is to get ahead of the curve, in fiscal policy and structural reform,'' he said.
With Italy in danger of being swept over the same waterfall as Greece, Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi on Thursday pledged sweeping changes to increase growth.
He said the measures would include privatization, infrastructure projects, cutting administrative hurdles, streamlining the government, and carrying out a ''historic'' change to Italy's constitution that would require balanced budgets.
''We want to adopt a comprehensive pact'' between the government, labor unions and businesses ''absolutely by September,'' Mr. Berlusconi said, a day after addressing Parliament.
Mr. Berlusconi played down growing fears that Italy could become the next country at risk in the spreading European debt crisis. ''I don't think the crisis will get worse,'' he said. ''We should not be afraid about the current level of spreads because they only affect a small part of the public debt at any moment, which overall remains at the interest rates it was placed at years ago.''
At a news conference later, the Italian finance minister, Giulio Tremonti, said Italy was in contact with the European Union, International Monetary Fund and Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development on strategies for growth.
Mr. Berlusconi interrupted Mr. Tremonti, to add, ''And the E.C.B.'' Mr. Tremonti looked taken aback and said, ''I think it's important, but not involved.'' He suggested the hope the bank would buy some Italian bonds.

HEADLINE: F.A.A. Impasse That Hit 4,000 Ends, for Now

BYLINE: By EDWARD WYATT; Andrew Pollack contributed reporting from Los Angeles.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The Obama administration has reached a patchwork agreement with Congressional leaders to end a 13-day partial shutdown of the Federal Aviation Administration, the Senate majority leader, Harry Reid, said Thursday.
The agreement signals an end, at least for a few weeks, to a standoff over policy issues that had left 4,000 agency employees out of work, idled tens of thousands of workers at hundreds of airport construction projects and cost the federal government more than $350 million in lost taxes on airline tickets.
Congressional officials said the deal arranges rubber-stamp passage by the Senate on Friday of a bill that was approved by the House last month, extending the aviation agency's operations through Sept. 16.
Only a few senators need to be present when the Senate convenes at 10 a.m., and if no one objects to the request for unanimous consent to pass the House bill, the impasse will officially be over. 
''This agreement does not resolve the important differences that still remain,'' Mr. Reid said in a statement. ''But I believe we should keep Americans working while Congress settles its differences, and this agreement will do exactly that.'' The agreement, in the wake of a nasty and protracted battle over the debt ceiling, was worked out as both the White House and Congress were beginning to feel pressure from voters who said they have grown tired of political fights that hurt working Americans and the economy.
Official Washington has been peppered in recent days by appeals from labor unions employing furloughed F.A.A. employees and construction workers and letters from trade groups representing airport executives and business groups.
Together, they expressed outrage that Congress left this week on a five-week vacation without resolving the F.A.A. issue, letting $30 million a day in airline ticket and fuel taxes go uncollected because of a dispute over $16.5 million in annual cuts to rural air service.
''This shutdown is putting thousands of critical employees out of work,'' a coalition of labor unions said in a statement Thursday, before the deal was reached. ''Every day this impasse continues is another day that major airport projects are delayed and work is stopped'' on upgrades of airport safety and aviation navigation systems.
Mr. Obama said in a statement that he was ''pleased that leaders in Congress are working together'' to put tens of thousands of Americans back to work. ''We can't afford to let politics in Washington hamper our recovery, so this is an important step forward,'' he said.
Senate Democrats had previously refused to pass the House bill because it contained cuts in the Essential Air Service, a subsidy program that helps to pay for commercial airline service to rural airports.
The breakthrough came on Thursday when the transportation secretary, Ray LaHood, told Congressional leaders that he has the authority to issue waivers for the communities affected by the cuts in rural air service contained in the House bill. The White House had been coordinating discussions for days involving Mr. LaHood, House Speaker John A. Boehner, Mr. Reid and others.
Congressional officials said Mr. LaHood had indicated that he would review the affected rural communities for waivers that would postpone the cuts, but added that he had not promised any specific action.
In a statement, Mr. LaHood said: ''This is a tremendous victory for American workers everywhere. From construction workers to our F.A.A. employees, they will have the security of knowing they are going to go back to work and get a paycheck -- and that's what we've been fighting for. We have the best aviation system in the world and we intend to keep it that way.''
The agreement does not address differences over labor issues that Senate Democrats said were the real reason that Republicans were trying to press for the cuts to rural air service. Democrats had embraced some of those changes in their own long-term F.A.A. reauthorization bill, which was passed earlier this year by the Senate.
The House also passed a long-term F.A.A. bill that included a measure to repeal a rule of the National Mediation Board, which oversees union and labor issues in the airline and railroad industries. The new rule, which passed after President Obama appointed two of the board's three members, reversed a 76-year-old rule and made it easier for unions to win a representation election. Under the old rule, workers who did not vote were counted as ''no'' votes; under the new rule, only those casting ballots were counted.
The F.A.A. and the Transportation Department offered repeated assurances that the partial shutdown did not threaten the safety of air travel. But among the 4,000 workers whose jobs were affected, out of a total F.A.A. workforce of 47,000, were 40 airport safety inspectors who check airport lighting, runway markings and other features that are part of federal safety guidelines.
Those inspectors were asked to work without pay and to pay their own travel expenses during the shutdown. Steven A. Oetzell, the chief inspector for the aviation agency's Western-Pacific region, said that he and the five inspectors have not minded.
''The bottom line is safety,'' he said in an interview Thursday morning, before the impasse was broken, at the F.A.A. regional headquarters in Hawthorne, Calif., a few miles from Los Angeles International Airport.
''What I've been most proud of is the fact that none of our inspectors has called in sick, none of our inspectors has threatened to not come into work, and one of our inspectors even canceled his personal vacation,'' Mr. Oetzell said.
He and the five people he supervises are responsible for about 50 airports in California, Arizona, Nevada, Hawaii and the Pacific Islands. An inspection can take two to four days and involves checking an airport's signage, lighting, runway markers, firefighting equipment, fueling facilities and record-keeping.
Inspectors have still been able to charge their travel expenses to their government credit cards. But since the funding ran out, they have not been reimbursed after they pay the credit card bill. Mr. Oetzell said an inspector might typically run up a bill of $500 to $2,000 a month.
That the shutdown seems to be over after two weeks will substantially lessen the hardship. Workers have not yet actually missed a paycheck, Mr. Oetzell said. About an hour after he spoke, an agreement was announced that would restore funding and put people back to work.
''This is the best piece of news I've heard in the last three, four weeks,'' Mr. Oetzell said, adding that he was not surprised. ''I have faith that our members of Congress will do the right thing.''

HEADLINE: India: Leader Travels to U.S. For Undisclosed Surgery

BYLINE: By LYDIA POLGREEN

 BODY:
NEW DELHI -- India's most powerful politician, Sonia Gandhi, has flown to the United States for surgery, said a spokesman for the governing Congress Party, which Mrs. Gandhi leads. 
The nature of her illness was not disclosed, but the spokesman, Janardan Dwivedi, told reporters here that ''generally her condition is satisfactory, but her operation has not taken place as yet.''
Mr. Dwivedi would not disclose what operation Ms. Gandhi would undergo or when. He did say that she was expected to recuperate abroad for two or three weeks. He did not say whether that would be in the United States.
Mrs. Gandhi, 64, the widow of former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi, has transformed herself from a shy, foreign-born homemaker to a formidable political force. Though she holds no formal position in the government, she is without question the most powerful figure in the Congress Party, her influence far eclipsing that of Manmohan Singh, India's prime minister.
Mrs. Gandhi is deeply influential, especially on social policy. With the help of a quasi-governmental kitchen cabinet called the National Advisory Council, she has pushed expensive but popular social welfare programs that were an important factor in her party's election victory in 2009.
In 2004, when she led the Congress Party to power after six years in opposition, she resisted calls to become prime minister, instead choosing Mr. Singh, a soft-spoken economist who had ushered in economic reforms as finance minister in 1991.
Information about the Gandhi family is tightly guarded, but Mrs. Gandhi is not known to suffer from any major illnesses.
Her absence from India comes at a difficult time. The government is battling multiple corruption scandals and struggling to combat rising inflation and slumping economic growth.
Her son and heir apparent, Rahul, will lead the party in her absence along with three other senior Congress Party leaders, Mr. Dwivedi said.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Congress Seen As Top Culprit In Debt Debate

BYLINE: By MICHAEL COOPER and MEGAN THEE-BRENAN; Marjorie Connelly, Allison Kopicki and Marina Stefan contributed reporting.

 BODY:
The debate over raising the debt ceiling, which brought the nation to the brink of default, has sent disapproval of Congress to its highest level on record and left most Americans saying that creating jobs should now take priority over cutting spending, according to the latest New York Times/CBS News Poll.
A record 82 percent of Americans now disapprove of the way Congress is handling its job -- the most since The Times first began asking the question in 1977, and even more than after another political stalemate led to a shutdown of the federal government in 1995.
More than four out of five people surveyed said that the recent debt-ceiling debate was more about gaining political advantage than about doing what is best for the country. Nearly three-quarters said that the debate had harmed the image of the United States in the world. 
Republicans in Congress shoulder more of the blame for the difficulties in reaching a debt-ceiling agreement than President Obama and the Democrats, the poll found.
The Republicans compromised too little, a majority of those polled said. All told, 72 percent disapproved of the way Republicans in Congress handled the negotiations, while 66 percent disapproved of the way Democrats in Congress handled negotiations.
The public was more evenly divided about how Mr. Obama handled the debt ceiling negotiations: 47 percent disapproved and 46 percent approved.
The public's opinion of the Tea Party movement has soured in the wake of the debt-ceiling debate. The Tea Party is now viewed unfavorably by 40 percent of the public and favorably by just 20 percent, according to the poll. In mid-April 29 percent of those polled viewed the movement unfavorably, while 26 percent viewed it favorably. And 43 percent of Americans now think the Tea Party has too much influence on the Republican Party, up from 27 percent in mid-April.
''I'm real disappointed in Congress,'' Ron Raggio, 54, a florist from Vicksburg, Miss., said in a follow-up interview. ''They can't sit down and agree about what's best for America. It's all politics.''
There were signs that the repeated Republican calls for more spending cuts were resonating with the public: 44 percent of those polled said the cuts in the debt-ceiling agreement did not go far enough, 29 percent said they were about right and only 15 percent said they went too far. More than a quarter of the Democrats polled said that the cuts in the agreement did not go far enough.
But by a ratio of more than two to one, Americans said that creating jobs should be a higher priority than spending cuts.
Though Republicans prevented tax increases from being included in the debt-ceiling deal, half of those polled said the agreement should have included increased tax revenue, while 44 percent said it should have relied on cuts alone. That issue is likely to be revisited soon: Congress is preparing to appoint a special committee to recommend ways to reduce the deficit. Sixty-three percent of those polled said that they supported raising taxes on households that earn more than $250,000 a year, as Mr. Obama has sought to do -- including majorities of Democrats (80 percent), independents (61 percent) and Republicans (52 percent).
The poll found that Mr. Obama was emerging from the crisis less bruised than the Republicans in Congress.
The president's overall job approval rating remained relatively stable, with 48 percent approving of the way he handles his job as president and 47 percent disapproving -- down from the bump up he received in the spring after the killing of Osama bin Laden, but in line with how he has been viewed for nearly a year. By contrast, Speaker John A. Boehner, an Ohio Republican, saw his disapproval rating shoot up 16 points since April: 57 percent of those polled now disapprove of the way he is handling his job, while only 30 percent approve.
Americans said that they trusted Mr. Obama to make the right decisions about the economy more than the Republicans in Congress, by 47 percent to 33 percent. They were evenly divided on the question of whether he showed ''strong qualities of leadership'' during the negotiations, with 49 percent saying he did and 48 percent saying he did not. And they were still more likely to blame President George W. Bush for the bulk of the nation's deficit: 44 percent said that the deficit was mostly caused by the Bush administration, 15 percent said it was mostly caused by the Obama administration and 15 percent blamed Congress.
The growing fears about the economy -- amid a sinking stock market and warnings that the nation risks sliding back into recession -- were reflected in the nationwide telephone poll, which was conducted Tuesday and Wednesday with 960 adults and has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points.
The number of Americans who rated the economy ''very bad'' was the highest it had been in a year. But there was uncertainty about whether the debt-ceiling deal would help or hurt the economy: nearly half said it would have no effect, while 24 percent said it would make the economy worse and 22 percent said it would improve it.
Americans were evenly divided on the parameters of the debt-ceiling deal, in which Congress agreed to allow the federal government to borrow the money needed to pay its current obligations and avoid default on the condition that it reduce the deficit by at least $2.1 trillion over the next 10 years. Over all, 46 percent of those polled approved of the deal, while 45 percent disapproved of it.
Most of those polled said that the spending cuts included either did not go far enough or were about right. But with the nation's unemployment rate at a stubborn 9.2 percent, 62 percent of those polled said that creating jobs should be the priority.
''Cutting spending is important, but getting people back to work is more important,'' said Diane Sherrell, 56, a Republican from Erwin, N.C. ''If people are working, they are more productive. There is less crime, there is less depression, there is less divorce. There are less hospital and medical bills. If you put people back to work, you are cutting spending.''
Stanley Oland, 62, a Republican from Kalispell, Mont., said that the government needed new jobs to generate the economic activity and the revenue it requires.
''That revenue supports the basic foundation for the economy, creates more jobs and stimulates the economy,'' he said. ''Unless you have working people you don't have revenue from taxes. If you cut spending, jobs will be eliminated and you won't get any revenue. Every dollar spent creates jobs.''

HEADLINE: S&P and the USA

BYLINE: PAUL KRUGMAN


HIGHLIGHT: We're a mess, but they're not the ones to judge.

 BODY:
OK, so Standard and Poors has gone ahead with the threatened downgrade. It's a strange situation.
On one hand, there is a case to be made that the madness of the right has made America a fundamentally unsound nation. And yes, it is the madness of the right: if not for the extremism of anti-tax Republicans, we would have no trouble reaching an agreement that would ensure long-run solvency.
On the other hand, it's hard to think of anyone less qualified to pass judgment on America than the rating agencies. The people who rated subprime-backed securities are now declaring that they are the judges of fiscal policy? Really?
Just to make it perfect, it turns out that S&P got the math wrong by $2 trillion, and after much discussion conceded the point -- then went ahead with the downgrade.
More than that, everything I've heard about S&P's demands suggests that it's talking nonsense about the US fiscal situation. The agency has suggested that the downgrade depended on the size of agreed deficit reduction over the next decade, with $4 trillion apparently the magic number. Yet US solvency depends hardly at all on what happens in the near or even medium term: an extra trillion in debt adds only a fraction of a percent of GDP to future interest costs, so a couple of trillion more or less barely signifies in the long term. What matters is the longer-term prospect, which in turn mainly depends on health care costs.
So what was S&P even talking about? Presumably they had some theory that restraint now is an indicator of the future -- but there's no good reason to believe that theory, and for sure S&P has no authority to make that kind of vague political judgment.
In short, S&P is just making stuff up -- and after the mortgage debacle, they really don't have that right.
So this is an outrage -- not because America is A-OK, but because these people are in no position to pass judgment.

HIGHLIGHT: The United States jobless report, which will be released at 8:30 a.m. ET, could be an early indicator of whether global markets will continue to worsen Friday.

 BODY:
Will the rout continue? Global stocks tanked on Thursday on pessimism over the state of economic affairs in both the United States and Europe. Recession-weary investors are losing hope for a recovery, and big European countries have still not wrestled their debt problems to the ground. The Lede blog is tracking developments in the markets Friday looking for clues to the near-term direction of stocks and bonds.

HIGHLIGHT: As technologists and entrepreneurs debate whether they are in the midst of a new technology bubble, real estate brokers in San Francisco agree that we're in a dot-com-era style rental market.

 BODY:
I've recently learned that real estate brokers in San Francisco have reached a consensus on a topic that entrepreneurs and investors can't seem to agree on: that we are in the midst of a technology bubble.
Technologists have been debating the existence of such a bubble for over a year now, but they just can't seem to agree. Some argue that companies like Twitter, Facebook and LinkedIn, are overvalued with multi-billion dollar valuations. Others say that technology companies are actually undervalued.
Real estate brokers in San Francisco have seen the evidence of a new dot-com style bubble: Rents are shooting up as the demand for apartments grows. As a newcomer to San Francisco, I can attest to how frantic the search for apartments has become in the area, and to the often audacious pricing of rental properties.
An article published on Thursday in The San Francisco Examiner notes that Bay Area renters are now seeing rent hikes that are eerily similar to those during the dot-com bubble that occurred a little more than a decade ago. RealFacts, a real estate analysis firm, told the Examiner that a new wave of San Francisco residents who work for technology giants and start-ups seemed to be responsible for the rise in apartment rental costs.
"I think a lot of new dot-com employees, specifically those who work for companies like Apple, Google and Twitter, are now moving into the city and can afford to pay much higher rents," said Sally Kuchar, editor of the real estate blog Curbed San Francisco, told me in a phone interview. "As a result, San Francisco rental rates have risen by 6 percent between 2010 and 2011."
As a very recent transplant to San Francisco, I've visited dozens of open houses over the past week and already see a frightful pattern. When I show up to see a property there is always a long line of young people, mostly wearing t-shirts adorned with Twitter, Facebook or Google logos, who are standing at the ready with an application, credit report and deposit check in hand. They often bid up the price of an apartment by several hundred dollars too.
Real estate brokers I've spoken with note that although the San Francisco market has always been challenging for renters, the current state of affairs is extraordinary.
Ms. Kuchar of Curbed said rents were also rising because more landlords were choosing to turn their properties into short-term rentals using services like AirBnB, a company that lets people rent out their spare bedrooms or homes to travelers.
"A lot of residential property owners are now converting their long-term rentals into vacation rentals; that has also depleted the market," Ms. Kuchar said. She also said that though high real estate prices make it clear there is a new bubble in Silicon Valley, no one can really predict how long it will take before it pops.

HEADLINE: S.&P.'s Rationale for Downgrading the U.S.

BYLINE: MICHAEL J. DE LA MERCED


HIGHLIGHT: Standard &#038; Poor's said it cut the United States' credit rating to AA+ from AAA because the recent deal to raise the debt ceiling failed to address the country's mounting obligations.

 BODY:
After weeks of of speculation, Standard & Poor's downgraded on Friday the credit rating of the United States by one notch, to AA+ from AAA. The agency's outlook on the country's short- and long-term ratings was also negative, meaning that a further downgrade to AA was possible.
Why? In a lengthy statement, S.&P. said that the recent deal to raise the United States' debt ceiling failed to address the country's mounting obligations. 
Here's the crucial takeaway from the agency's statement:
"In our view, the difficulty in framing a consensus on fiscal policy weakens the government's ability to manage public finances and diverts attention from the debate over how to achieve more balanced and dynamic economic growth in an era of fiscal stringency and private-sector deleveraging (ibid). A new political consensus might (or might not) emerge after the 2012 elections, but we believe that by then, the government debt burden will likely be higher, the needed medium-term fiscal adjustment potentially greater, and the inflection point on the U.S. population's demographics and other age-related spending drivers closer at hand."
S.&P. also expects the Bush administration's tax cuts, passed in 2001 and 2003,to remain in place past their expiration next year because of Republican opposition to their lapsing. The agency expects annual real trend gross domestic product growth of 3 percent and annual consumer price inflation of almost 2 percent over the coming decade.
In outlining what could lead to a further cut, to AA, S.&P. had this to say:
"We could lower the long-term rating to 'AA' within the next two years if we see that less reduction in spending than agreed to, higher interest rates or new fiscal pressures during the period result in a higher general government debt trajectory than we currently assume in our base case."

HEADLINE: Wild Market Quiets the Buzz for I.P.O.'s

BYLINE: EVELYN M. RUSLI and MICHAEL J. DE LA MERCED


HIGHLIGHT: A small number of companies have already scaled back or canceled their initial stock offerings because of volatile market conditions.

 BODY:
As stocks swing violently, a chill is beginning to settle on the initial public offering market. 
A small number of companies have already retreated on their offering plans. WageWorks, an employee benefits provider, pushed its offering, originally scheduled for Friday, to next week and dropped its target price range by as much as 43 percent. Two real estate investment trusts, Orchid Island Capital and Eola Property Trust, have withdrawn their filings. And Old Mutual, a big South African insurance company, said on Friday that it was now unlikely to go public in the United States before the end of next year because of market conditions.
For volatility is the enemy of the I.P.O. market. The ripples could spread, affecting even larger offerings this year, including some hotly awaited Internet offerings, as well as the sales of government-owned shares in companies like the American International Group, General Motors and the lender Ally Financial. 
Ally may prove to be the most difficult, with the Treasury Department and its underwriters having postponed its initial public offering in June. The former G.M. financing arm may now seek to go public in September, though that is looking unlikely given the recent market swings, according to a person briefed on the matter.
Yet A.I.G.'s chief executive, Robert H. Benmosche, professed little worry about the current market conditions' effect on the insurer's next stock offering. "We're going to make that decision in November," he said in an interview on Friday. 
Still, when there are jitters in the market, offerings are vulnerable.
"Until volatility settles, we're not going to see a lot of I.P.O. launches," said Brian Reilly, head of United States equity capital markets at Barclays Capital, referring to the moment a company sets its price range and starts a road show to court investors.
One measure of market volatility, the Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index, or VIX - known as Wall Street's fear gauge - on Friday reached its highest level since May 2010. That degree of uncertainty makes it difficult for companies to price their offerings and for investors to feel confident that they can generate meaningful returns.
"The best advice for most clients is to wait for volatility to calm down," Mr. Reilly said. 
The sharp jitters in the market threaten a broad range of deals on Wall Street, including acquisitions, which can be ultrasensitive to price fluctuations in the equity markets. But the current roller coaster may be particularly damaging to the offerings market, analysts say, which is still recovering from the financial crisis, when it was virtually moribund. 
Although demand for offerings in the United States has been somewhat uneven, the market has shown signs of strength. So far this year, the number of offerings is up nearly 15 percent, to 93, while proceeds have more than doubled to $28.5 billion, according to data from Renaissance Capital, a firm that advises on stock offerings. 
A lot of that growth can be traced to the technology sector, which has produced some of the most highly anticipated public offerings, like the online music service Pandora Media and LinkedIn, the social network for professionals. When LinkedIn went public in May, it raised more than $350 million and its shares surged 109 percent on their first day of trading. 
LinkedIn's success was seen to be a curtain raiser to a string of even larger Internet blockbusters. The popular games maker Zynga and Groupon, a daily coupon Web site, have recently filed to go public. Facebook, the world's largest social network, is on track to file within the next eight months, at a valuation north of $100 billion, according to people close to the matter. 
These popular start-ups, which have been heavily traded on secondary markets, were largely seen as immune to market turbulence because of the feverish demand for their shares. But a prolonged severe period of volatility could eventually drag down these companies too, analysts say, forcing management and bankers to revise timelines and trim valuations. 
"You can't sit here with a high valuation, when everything else is crashing around you," said Kathleen Smith, a principal at Renaissance. "Even Facebook may have a hard time getting its offering done at a premium."
For now, the hope is that the economy calms down by September, when the stock offering market restarts in earnest after a traditionally slow August. 
"Thank goodness it's August," said Horace Nash, a partner at Fenwick & West, a prestigious Silicon Valley law firm. "In the medium term, it's pretty unpredictable, but it's not going to kill a filed transaction."
Though Mr. Nash still believes the largest offerings exist in a silo apart from the rest of the technology sector, he says instability will most likely sway their valuations. "That would really put the sand in the gears," he said. 
David J. Abella, a portfolio manager with Rochdale Investment Management, says he is closely watching the markets and has already lowered his price expectations based on the broader market declines. He foresees a stark divide in the market, where offerings from well-known brands like Dunkin' Donuts and Zynga perform well, but the rest of the market struggles to find its footing. 
"If I'm able to get an allocation from a top-tier name, I will generally be a buyer," he said. "In this market, you might not get the same upside as LinkedIn, but it will probably still be attractive." 
Mr. Abella says his firm will not buy shares from top tier names on the first day of trading and will be especially wary of debt-laden, private-equity-backed offerings, which he predicts will suffer in this environment. 
Investor confidence will be put to the test once again next week, with 12 companies expected to go public in the final push before the late-summer lull. WageWorks is back, along with Trustwave Holdings, an enterprise software company, and HomeStreet, a modest-sized regional bank. If all go public, it will be the best showing since 2007. But few expect next week to go without a hitch.
"Some may do better than expected, but it's gotten a lot riskier," Mr. Abella said.

HEADLINE: Home Entertainment Spending Continues To Slide

BYLINE: MICHAEL CIEPLY


HIGHLIGHT: Hollywood has been struggling to compensate for the lower revenue from DVDs and downloads.

 BODY:
LOS ANGELES - Home entertainment revenue slowed its decline in the second quarter, as total spending in the United States on DVDs, downloads and other formats fell 3.55 percent to about $3.99 billion, down from $4.14 billion in the second quarter of 2010, according to the Digital Entertainment Group. First quarter sales had fallen by about 6.41 percent from the year-earlier period.
The group, which tracks sales across the entertainment industry, said home entertainment sales for the first half were $8.34 billion, down 5.06 percent from $8.78 billion in the first half of 2010.
The movie and television industries have been struggling for years with a continuing slide in home entertainment sales, as piracy took a toll, and consumers spent less to purchase discs, and showed a growing preference for cheaper digital formats and low-priced rentals. In the second quarter, revenue from video rental kiosks, which have generally underpriced rental stores, grew 36.7 percent to $403.7 million, surpassing rental revenue from stores, which fell almost 29 percent, to $393 million. Store rentals had surpassed those from kiosks in the year-earlier period.
In Friday's report, the group said the anticipated home video release of blockbusters like "Transformers: Dark of the Moon" and "Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2" promised stronger performance in the year's second half.

HEADLINE: July's Political Best Sellers

BYLINE: GERRY MULLANY


HIGHLIGHT: July's political best sellers is dominated by books tied to warfare.

 BODY:
"A World On Fire" by Amanda Foreman debuts at No. 10. Ms. Foreman, the acclaimed historian, sheds light on the vast involvement that Britain had in the American Civil War; the fruits of her research shocked her: finding that countless British writers, students, actors and others sympathized with the feudal South. "The Storm Of War" by Andrew Roberts debuts at No. 13. A British historian, Roberts ponders that if the Axis had strategized and made better decisions, they possibly could have won World War II. And the final debut is "The Triple Agent" by Joby Warrick at No. 14. This is the first comprehensive account of the C.I.A. blunder that allowed an Al Qaeda mole, Humam al-Balawi, a Jordanian pediatrician turned spy, to detonate a custom-made vest of explosives that took the lives of nine intelligence operatives at a C.I.A. base in Afghanistan. 
The full list for July:
1. In The Garden Of Beasts, by Erik Larson. (Crown, $26.) This portrait of Berlin during the rise of the Nazi Party concentrates on William E. Dodd, who became the U.S. ambassador to Germany in 1933, and his daughter, Martha.
2. Seal Team Six, by Howard E. Wasdin and Stephen Templin. (St. Martin's, $26.99.) An expert sniper and former member of the Navy Seals recounts his military training and missions, including the battle of Mogadishu in 1993.
3. Unbroken, by Laura Hillenbrand. (Random House, $27.) An Olympic runner's story of survival as a prisoner of the Japanese in World War II.
4. Lost In Shangri-La, by Mitchell Zuckoff. (Harper/HarperCollins, $26.99.) After a jungle plane crash in 1945, three survivors were caught between headhunters and enemy Japanese.
5. Reckless Endangerment, by Gretchen Morgenson and Joshua Rosner. (Times Books/Holt, $30.) This account of the Wall Street implosion highlights individuals who played crucial roles and bore responsibility.
6. The Miracle Of Freedom, by Chris Stewart and Ted Stewart. (Deseret Book Company, $28.99.) The authors discuss "seven tipping points that saved the world," including the Battle of Thermopylae, Constantine's conversion to Christianity, and the Battle of Britain.
7. Demonic, by Ann Coulter. (Crown Forum, $28.99.) The columnist compares the Democratic Party to a mob.
8. Area 51, by Annie Jacobsen. (Little, Brown, $27.99.) An account of the mysterious military installation, which the author contends is the home of secret espionage programs.
9. The Heart And The Fist, by Eric Greitens. (Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, $27.) A Navy Seal describes his military deployments and his larger vision of public service.
10. A World On Fire, by Amanda Foreman. (Random House, $35.) An account of the major role Britain played in the American Civil War.
11. On China, by Henry Kissinger. (Penguin Press, $36.) China and America are mutually dependent economic giants, Kissinger writes, but they need to design of partnership.
12. The Secret Knowledge, by David Mamet. (Sentinel, $27.95.) The playwright denounces liberalism and offers his views on religion and American culture.
13. The Storm Of War, by Andrew Roberts. (Harper, $29.99.) A distinctive, comprehensive and detailed account of World War II.
14. The Triple Agent, by Joby Warrick. (Doubleday, $26.95.) The intelligence debacle of the CIA in Khost, Afghanistan post-9/11.
15. The Post-American World: Release 2.0, by Fareed Zakaria. (Norton, $26.95.) Author of "The Future Of Freedom" optimistic forecast for America as other nations prosper in the 21st century.
Rankings are based on July figures at many thousands of venues where a wide range of general interest books are sold nationwide. These include hundreds of independent book retailers (statistically weighted to represent all such outlets nationwide); national, regional and local chains; online and multimedia entertainment retailers; university, gift, supermarket, discount, department stores and newsstands. An asterisk (*) indicates that a book's sales are barely distinguishable from those of the book above. A dagger () indicates that some bookstores report receiving bulk orders.

HEADLINE: Mobilizing Help for People Accused of Hacking

BYLINE: COLIN MOYNIHAN


HIGHLIGHT: Courthouse Confidential: A left-leaning lawyers' group is offering help to those ensnared in the government's investigation into electronic attacks against corporations and the United States government.

 BODY:
When Senator Joseph R. McCarthy held hearings in the 1950s to question witnesses about their supposed ties to communism, critics accused him of fomenting a Red Scare hysteria. 
Decades later, the term Green Scare was used to describe a series of sweeping federal prosecutions of people involved in radical environmental and animal rights groups.
Now, perhaps, comes the Nerd Scare.
That is the phrase used by the National Lawyers Guild to describe a wave of subpoenas and indictments aimed at people thought to be members of activist hacker groups like Anonymous and LulzSec, which are known for waging cyberattacks against corporations including Sony, Amazon and Visa. 
On Monday, the guild unveiled a Web site, www.anonlg.com, meant to help people or groups accused of hacking to find free legal representation. In July, the Federal Bureau of Investigation arrested more than a dozen suspected Anonymous members accused of using a tool called the low orbit ion cannon to carry out a denial of service attack against PayPal.
The attack took the company's Web site off line for four days in December. It was carried out, according to members of Anonymous, in retaliation for PayPal's refusal to process credit card payments to Wikileaks, a whistle-blowing organization that has made public hundreds of thousands of sensitive documents from the United States military and the State Department. 
Law enforcement authorities say the electronic attacks have cost millions of dollars. But others have said that they caused little lasting harm and should be treated more like a political protest than a serious economic crime.
That view fits with the history of the lawyers guild, a national group that the F.B.I. has admitted to trying to disrupt with counterintelligence programs and warrantless searches from 1940 to 1975. Since the 1930s, members of the guild, which has headquarters in Manhattan, have represented a host of defendants tied to left-leaning causes. Clients have included producers and screenwriters who refused to testify before Mr. McCarthy's committee investigating communist infiltration, protesters at national political conventions and people accused of being environmental extremists.
"It became pretty clear to us that this was a new wave of activism, protesting the growth of corporations' power," the guild's executive director, Heidi Boghosian, said, referring to the Anonymous attacks. "And it seemed to us that it would also be a new chapter in the Justice Department's view."
Ms. Boghosian said that she was concerned that those accused of hacking were facing harsher penalties than their alleged actions might otherwise warrant because the cyberattacks were aimed at prominent companies and were motivated by sympathy for Wikileaks and its founder, Julian Assange, whose publication of secret documents was condemned by the Obama administration. 
An indictment unsealed last month in San Jose, Calif., where PayPal is situated, said that 14 Anonymous members used an open source computer program to bombard PayPal computers with messages, thus denying service to legitimate users. The defendants are charged with intentionally damaging protected computers, which carries a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison and a $250,000 fine, and with conspiracy, which carries an additional 5 years and $250,000 for each count.
 The Justice Department has said that the investigation into Anonymous, which has involved more than 75 searches in at least 10 states, is continuing.
In the spring, as word of the investigation spread, the lawyers guild decided to help the hackers. The new Web site offers advice for those who are served with subpoenas or whose homes are raided and includes a phone number to call for help in finding a lawyer. It also has links to a primer by the Electronic Frontier Foundation called "Surveillance Self-Defense" and an illustrated pamphlet called "If an Agent Knocks" by the Center for Constitutional Rights.
Over the last several weeks, the guild has sent messages to members across the country asking for pro bono volunteers to represent accused Anonymous members. Among those who responded was Omar Figueroa, in Sebastopol, Calif., who said that he was looking forward to exploring issues of government monitoring of law and technology that had not yet been heavily litigated.
Mr. Figueroa, who said that he was representing one of those indicted but would not reveal the name of his client, said that he questioned whether it was fair to say that Anonymous members had hacked PayPal computers when they had never penetrated the network, only flooded it with messages. 
"They are trying to accuse someone of breaking and entering, when all they have done is ring the doorbell," Mr. Figueroa said, "albeit in an annoying fashion."
A guild member in San Francisco, John Hamasaki, said that his client had been indicted, and he described the investigation into Anonymous as "the almighty power of the federal government cracking down on ordinary citizens in a situation where nobody was hurt." 
The client, Keith Downey, a 26-year-old carpenter in Jacksonville, Fla., declined to discuss the charges against him. But, he said, he was surprised by "the government putting all of these resources into something so minor" and added that he was still shaken by his arrest several weeks ago.
"I woke up and literally had an assault rifle in my face," he said. "It was the last thing I expected on a random Tuesday morning."

HEADLINE: Complaints That Rent Is Illegally High Often Languish

BYLINE: CARA BUCKLEY


HIGHLIGHT: In a survey of 200 rent-regulated apartments, a tenant advocacy group found that landlords for nearly half the units had registered rents above what they could legally charge; it also found that processing complaints often took at least a year.

 BODY:
Relations between Maria de los Santos and the landlord of her railroad apartment in Bushwick, Brooklyn, soured after she filed a complaint in 2007 over lack of heat. But they worsened, she said, after she discovered that she had been overcharged in rent and appealed to the state housing agency for help.
Ms. de los Santos said that the agency did not process her complaint for 18 months and that she has yet to be paid the $10,000 that the landlord owes her, according to the agency. All the while, she said, her landlord took advantage of the delay to harass her.
"He came to the store," said Ms. de los Santos, who runs a flower shop, "and he said, 'If you're still fighting for this, why don't you just leave?' "
A tenant advocacy group says Ms. de los Santos's case is not unusual. In a survey of 200 rent-regulated apartments, the group, Make the Road New York, found that landlords for nearly half the units had registered rents above what they could legally charge. Yet because enforcement is largely complaint driven, the state agency usually investigated rent increases only after tenants complained.
Processing the complaints, the advocacy group found, often took at least a year. 
"It's not anything radical we're asking for," said Hilary Klein, a lead organizer at Make the Road New York, "just that tenants' rights under the law be enforced."
Landlords of rent-regulated apartments are required to report the legal rents for their units, as well as the actual amount they charge, to the state agency, New York State Homes and Community Renewal.
Christopher Browne, deputy commissioner for policy and communications at Homes and Community Renewal, noted that Albany had recently overhauled rent laws. 
"Enforcement is one of the things that are being strengthened," Mr. Browne said.
The agency is responsible for administering laws that govern 875,000 rent-regulated apartments statewide. Last year, 1,892 cases alleging overcharges were filed, and the agency found in the tenants' favor 670 times.
Roberta Bernstein, president of the Small Property Owners of New York, a landlord association, said that while rent overcharges did happen, landlords were often hamstrung by the legal rent that they could collect, which often, she said, did not cover maintenance or routine repairs.
"I'm not denying that it occurs, but in some cases, there could be legal reasons, valid reasons, for what's happening," Ms. Bernstein said. "You have skewed situations where tenants are subsidized by the owner, and the owner attempts to balance the scales."
She questioned the sources of the information in Make the Road New York's report (see also below), which was based on rent histories of 200 households, some of which came from rent histories collected by other community organizations.
Judith Goldiner, a supervising lawyer at the Legal Aid Society, said many tenants were unaware that their apartments were rent regulated, and often too intimidated to challenge their landlords.
After Ms. de los Santos, 32, discovered her rent overcharge - she was paying $1,080 and it was supposed to be, according to rent records, $927 - she began paying the lesser amount.
Her landlord, Manuel Gonzalez, paid her about $3,600 for the overcharges, but Ms. De los Santos said the check did not clear.
Early this year, the state agency ruled that Mr. Gonzalez owed her a total of $10,000, less the $3,600. He has yet to pay, and Ms. de los Santos has appealed to the state agency for help. 
Reached by phone, Mr. Gonzalez initially said he did not know that his check had been returned. But then he said he was having difficulties with his properties and was short of funds.
"We're going to fix the problem with this," he said "We're going to pay and we got no money, O.K.?"
Before he could be asked about Ms. de los Santos's claim that he harassed her, he hung up.

HEADLINE: Complaints That Rent Is Illegally High Often Languish

BYLINE: CARA BUCKLEY


HIGHLIGHT: In a survey of 200 rent-regulated apartments, a tenant advocacy group found that landlords for nearly half the units had registered rents above what they could legally charge; it also found that processing complaints often took at least a year.

 BODY:
Relations between Maria de los Santos and the landlord of her railroad apartment in Bushwick, Brooklyn, soured after she filed a complaint in 2007 over lack of heat. But they worsened, she said, after she discovered she had been overcharged in rent and appealed to the state housing agency for help.
Ms. de los Santos said the agency did not process her complaint for 18 months and, according to the agency, she has yet to be paid the $10,000 that the landlord owes her. All the while, she said, her landlord took advantage of the delay to harass her.
"He came to the store," said Ms. de los Santos, who runs a flower shop, "and he said, 'If you're still fighting for this, why don't you just leave?' "
A tenant advocacy group says Ms. de los Santos's case is not unusual. In a survey of 200 rent-regulated apartments, the group, Make the Road New York, found that landlords for nearly half the units had registered rents above what they could legally charge. Yet because enforcement is largely complaint-driven, the state housing agency usually investigated rent increases only after tenants complained.

HEADLINE: The Do-Everything Congress

BYLINE: MARK GREENBAUM


HIGHLIGHT: How Capitol Hill's 37th legislative session, which sat from 1861 to 1863, laid the groundwork for modern America.

 BODY:
Last week New York magazine, in a list of the worst Congresses in history, highlighted "The Inarguably Awful 37th," which ran between 1861 and 1863: "The very least that can be said for the other congressional classes on this list is that they did not oversee the eruption of a catastrophic civil war." And that's pretty much all the 37th Congress is remembered for - which is a shame, because it was actually one of the most productive and momentous in American history. 
Like President Lincoln, Congress took office not knowing if the United States would endure. When it convened, about a third of the seats in both chambers were vacant, as newly declared Confederates had emptied Washington. Fittingly, members served under an unfinished Capitol dome - construction on the cast-iron edifice began in 1855 and would not be completed until 1863 - at once a symbol of republican government striving to rise up just as fierce fighting mere miles south on the battlefields of Virginia, and elsewhere, sought to tear it down. 
Yet, despite the mortal threat that hung over the nation throughout the two-year session, the new Congress was able to pass laws of incredible breadth and significance for both the immediate stability and future growth of the United States. Congress's work in these early years of the Civil War helped lay the track not simply for the Union's victory, but the groundwork for the nation's educational, socio-economic and physical expansion. The 37th Congress, in the words of the historian Leonard Curry, set the "blueprint for modern America." 
First came the Revenue Acts of 1861 (and later 1862) which created the first federal income tax, to help fund the Union war effort. While the acts would be repealed after the war, their impact on the future economic direction of the nation is clear: with their precedent, income taxes would serve as future keystones of the nation's economy, as would the National Banking Act passed near the conclusion of the session, which established a single national currency. 
In 1862, Congress ended slavery in the District of Columbia, a critical forerunner to the Emancipation Proclamation and, eventually, abolition. Soon thereafter it created the Department of Agriculture, a guiding engine for the nation's agricultural expansion during the post-Civil War era - a boom that the same Congress facilitated with the Homestead Act which enticed over a million Americans westward on the promise of earning 160 acres of land to call their own. Also helping spur that drive was the Pacific Railway Act of 1862, which began the construction of the first transcontinental railroad from Omaha and San Francisco, culminating with the famous linking of the Central and Union Pacific lines at Promontory, Utah seven years later.
The 37th Congress's contribution to education was also estimable. A week before the brutal Seven Days Battles raged outside of Richmond, it passed the Morrill Land-Grant Colleges Act, which set aside over 15 million acres for the founding of agricultural and mechanics schools. The landmark act led to the founding of institutions including Cornell, Berkeley and the University of Wisconsin, and established the backbone of the finest public university system in the world. 
And in one of its final legislative moves in 1863, it passed the False Claims Act to combat abuses by federal contractors. Better known today as "Lincoln's Law," the act remains arguably the most effective anti-fraud statute ever passed, having recovered over $20 billion from war profiteers and deterred exponentially more since 1986 alone.
How did such a visionary slate of legislation come to pass? To be sure, Congress remained focused throughout the session on supporting the war effort, and assorted measures like the Revenue Acts were enacted with that overarching goal in mind. 
The quick answer is that Congress was able to move so adroitly because Republicans held the White House and possessed huge majorities in both the House and Senate. Founded in the mid-1850s, the party catapulted to immediate success with the dissolution of the Whig Party and the collapse of the Know Nothing movement, doing well in the 1856 elections and capturing the House of Representatives just two years later. In 1860, Republicans won nearly three-fifth majorities in each chamber, paving the way for a unified government.
Prior to Republicans' birth and quick rise, Democratic congresses had been stymieing economic growth for years. Looking back in 1863, Maine Republican Senator and future Treasury Secretary William Fessenden captured his party's ambitious outlook in the 37th, noting, "I cannot say that the wiser course was not to make the most of our time, for no one knows how soon this country may again fall into a democratic slough." 
From the beginning, the Republicans had a clear idea about what they wanted. As the historian Eric Foner has observed about the young party, "their outlook was grounded in its emphasis on social mobility and economic growth, it reflected an adaption of that ethic to the dynamic, expansive, capitalist society of the ante-Bellum North." Indeed, the party's core principle held that any American could advance himself in society and achieve economic independence, and that the future lay with industrial growth and westward expansion, away from the decayed, slaved-based southern model. The role of government, then, was to make this happen. These were old Whig philosophies Lincoln himself had subscribed to from the very start of his political career in his almost monastic pursuit of internal improvements. 
At times the anti-slavery element of the party platform could overwhelm the economic-development element as the era in Congress is remembered mostly for colorful figures like Thaddeus Stevens, Benjamin Wade and Charles Sumner, who were dedicated first and foremost to the slave issue. Similarly, many Democrats who had switched sides to the Republican Party in the 1850s, including Salmon Chase, Gideon Welles and Francis P. Blair, did so over slavery and did not agree with many of their new party's core economic views. 
Ultimately, however, Radical Republicans' focus on slavery, and former Democrats' misgivings, did not derail the enactment of the party's economic agenda. While many early state Republican platforms ignored economic issues to avoid divisions, this had already begun to change near the end of the 1850s, as many converted Jacksonian Democrats began to tone down their anti-government sentiments in the wake of the Panic of 1857. 
Not that infighting was lacking on Capitol Hill. Partisanship during the war was perhaps even more toxic than ever; Republicans created the Committee on the Conduct of the War largely to disgrace Democratic generals in the aftermath of the disastrous Battle of Balls Bluff (where Republican Senator Edward Baker was killed). 
But in the end, progress would define the Congress's work and would build the nation as the old-line Whiggish vision of economic growth and opportunity won out. 
It's understandable why the drama of the Civil War should overshadow the grinding legislative activities of Capitol Hill and the 37th Congress. But for anyone who has ever gone to a public university, spent a dollar bill or ridden a passenger train cross-country, it's a legislative session that deserves to be remembered.

HIGHLIGHT: 8:58 A.M. GreenJust after the jobless figures were released by the Labor Department, stock index futures flashed green, suggesting there might be something of a recovery at the Wall Street opening.

 BODY:
5:20 P.M. | The Effect on Americans
We asked Times readers via Twitter and Facebook how recent economic news had affected their outlook, which generated some lively discussion. Many people expressed anxiety at a bad situation getting worse.
"I'm already unemployed - can't collect unemployment, I'm already broke, I have no health insurance and I have to live with my parents in my mid 30s. I'm already at rock bottom. It feels like it can't get much worse for me," Stacey Gotsulias wrote on Facebook.
Ashley Rufino wrote on Facebook, "Everything changed, but that happened a long time ago. My husband and I are in our mid 20's and we have no clue what lies ahead... which is scary. This country has turned its back to their veterans (including my husband) and has placed the consequences of playing politics on the backs of those who are already struggling. I consider ourselves lucky that we can keep a roof over our head and food in our stomach, but we cannot save money, afford health insurance, or move forward with our lives. We are standing still and barely holding on. We want to buy a house, have kids, save for retirement etc etc. American Dream, right? Or has the ability to obtain such a dream just wishful thinking today? Not only does our future look gloomy, but I do not want to even imagine what the future holds for our children and grandchildren. True Democracy died when people found the price tag."
Others were more sanguine about the effect of the day's news on their personal finances.
"People who make plans on how the stock market is doing because of one week shouldn't own stocks," Brooke Johnson wrote on Facebook.
Amy Laguitao wrote on Facebook, "Markets are constantly in a state of uncertainty so one should have to brace him/herself and see to it that whatever may happen to the market, it won't affect his/her plans. I bet this is the wise way, I do!"
On Twitter, @a_ad_r wrote, "The economy of course worries everyone, but I'm optimistic & not willing to change my lifestyle."
"I make financial decisions based on my personal economy, not the global economy. So, I bought a boat," wrote Cheryl Smith Mills on Facebook.

4:43 P.M. | S.&.P Fell 7% in the Week
It turned out to be the worst weeks in three years.
In the end, the broader market as measured by the Standard & Poor's 500 index was unable to muster a gain, just barely slipping into the red with a 0.69 point decline. That meant it finished the week down 7.1 percent, making it the worst weekly decline since November 2008.
The Dow Jones industrial average was down 5.7 percent for the week and the Nasdaq closed 8 percent lower. 
As might be expected with the talk of the possibility of a recession hanging over the markets, financial stocks were left in the dust. Of all the sectors in the S.&P. 500, financial stocks were the worst performing, declining more than 1.7 percent. Bank of America and Citigroup fell more than 7 percent and nearly 4 percent, respectively.
Consumer staples, on the other hand, were the best-performing sector, up 1.63 percent.
3:18 P.M. | Gold Is Holding Up
As a "safe haven" asset, gold has held up in today's volatile market. But other precious metals more closely related to industrial use are not doing as well.
For the last couple of weeks, the price of gold has hit six record highs, noted James Steel, a commodities analyst at HSBC, referring to its nominal price.
But in Thursday's market rout, skittish investors reacted to the equity declines by raising cash. Gold prices plunged as investors basically cashed in their holdings, using it as the safe-haven asset it is intended to be.
"Gold proved itself to be a safe haven yesterday," said Mr. Steel. "It is perversely positive. It shows investors are able to liquidate a hard asset in times of stress."
On Friday, when the better-than-expected jobs data came out, the market for gold bullion dropped to the low of the day, or about $1,643 an ounce. It then made a bit of a choppy comeback but largely was unchanged.
In the near-term outlook, since the reasons for higher gold prices do not seem to have diminished, there could be some deferred demand in its most robust markets: India, China and the Middle East.
Other precious metals, such as silver, palladium and platinum, have fallen harder with the poor economic outlook as they are more closely tied to industrial use. Those metals have weakened against gold and could continue to do as long as the economic "malaise" continues, Mr. Steel said.
2:50 P.M. | Italy's Promises
News came from across the Atlantic that helped support stocks in the United States in late afternoon trading.
Reuters reported that the European Central Bank would buy Italian bonds if Italy undertook further reforms, and Italy's prime minister, Silvio Berlusconi, later appeared to come through, pledging to bring forward austerity measures and bring Italy's budget into balance by 2013, a year ahead of the original plan. 
"We consider it appropriate to introduce an acceleration of the measures which we introduced recently in the fiscal planning law to give us the possibility of reaching our objective of balancing the budget early, by 2013 instead of 2014," Mr. Berlusconi announced, according to the agency report. 
Mr. Berlusconi spoke at a news conference in Rome after a day of calls with world leaders, including German Chancellor Angela Merkel and United States Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner.
2:25 P.M. | Deja Vu All Over Again
In the week ended March 6, 2009, the government's monthly labor report showed that unemployment had surged to its highest level in 25 years. The unemployment rate was 8.1 percent in February, it said, after the economy lost 651,000 jobs. 
The broad stock market as measured by the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index ended that five-day period down 7.03 percent, a record low that has held until now.
Fast forward to today, and that record is in our sights. At 1:15 p.m., the S.&P. index was at about 1,206.04, setting it on track to finish the five-day trading week down 6.67 percent.
The index is trading higher for the day, but it has been dug down so deep in losses recently that it could still break the five-day record. 
That would make this week the index's worst such period since the week March 6, 2009, according to Howard Silverblatt, S.&P.'s senior index analyst.
12:44 P.M. | Breaking the Fall
Amid Thursday's mayhem, why didn't Wall Street's "circuit breakers" kick in and stop the plunge in stocks? Because the flow of orders to buy and sell was relatively orderly, The Wall Street Journal reports.
The circuit breakers introduced after the 2010 "flash crash" to guard against rapid price swings were triggered by just one stock on Thursday, the WSJ said. In another case, NYSE Amex canceled a set of trades relating to what was probably trader error.
However, "Problems in Europe were more severe, where derivatives markets run by NYSE Euronext reported a 90-minute trading engine outage that forced a delayed open for interest-rate and stock-index contracts, while driving erroneous calculations of equity indexes compiled by the exchange group," the article said.
Restrictions were also invoked on roughly 460 short sales when a stock's price fell at least 10 percent. "In such cases, traders are only allowed to sell the stock short at a price above the highest national bid, serving to relieve what is often sharp, rapid selling pressure," the Journal reported.
12:24 P.M. | Waiting for Stocks to Stick
There is an old saying in the business that at least one Wall Street trader is keeping in mind today: "Nobody wants to try to catch a falling knife." 
The idea is that if the market is tanking, don't rush in.
"Let it land, and then get involved," said Gordon Charlop, a managing director at Rosenblatt Securities. "Don't fight the trend. Eventually it will stick somewhere."
"You would rather miss it by 100 points on the Dow than to jump into the big selling pressure," he said.
With the trend still down - the Dow, the S&P and the Nasdaq are down about 1 percent - there was a lot of negativity to work through before the weekend, when investors and traders are usually hesitant to carry positions.
Dr. Charlop said the opening bell rally was just a temporary reprieve, gradually giving way to a choppy trading. 
"Clearly right now, the bears are running the market," he said. "So what is it that is going to get people confident? That is the big question."
12:19 P.M. | The Weekend Is Nigh
Now that the jobs report is behind them, traders are moving on, juggling a variety of indicators to help them look for direction. Among them are the volatility index (up), the 10-year Treasury yield (up to 2.44 percent) and even the lowly calendar to remind them that in the near term, the weekend is nearly upon us and next week, the Federal Reserve is scheduled to meet.
''This may go some way to helping stabilize market sentiment,'' James Knightley, an economist at ING, said after the jobs report. But he warned that investor attention would switch to how the Federal Reserve will react after a meeting of its open market committee next week.
That's in the United States. Then there is Europe. A statement is expected to be released after a phone conference today between Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany and President Nicolas Sarkozy of France. Perhaps it will give analysts more information, or even ease some of the concerns of investors, about euro zone problems.
10:33 A.M. | Lack of Communication?
Forgive the understatement, but investors and traders thrive on information. And in the mind of at least one European official, an insufficient amount of information might have been a factor behind the recent market turmoil.
Olli Rehn, the European Union's top finance official, said that European Union leaders have failed to adequately explain how a second bailout for Greece, which he described as a "comprehensive, detailed and technically complex" agreement, and other reforms would work. As a result, financial markets had unrealistic expectations about the implementation of the agreement.
But once investors understand that European officials are "working night and day to put flesh on the bones" of the agreement, investors will be reassured, my colleague in Brussels, James Kanter, quotes Mr. Rehn as saying. "All of us who are in responsible positions in Europe will have to do much better in order to ensure verbal discipline and rigor," Mr. Rehn said.
9:53 A.M. | A Short-Lived Rally
At the much-anticipated opening bell, the Dow, the S.&P. 500 and the Nasdaq indexes all rose and within minutes were each up more than 1 percent. As expected, benchmark 10-year Treasury yields were up 2.5 percent.
 But the stock rally quickly faded. Before the half-hour mark, all three indexes were in negative territory. It could be that the markets are picking apart the jobs numbers, and, ever skeptical, are not liking what they see. Sure, there was a rise in nonfarm payrolls, but population growth needs to be taken into account, as well as the bumpy nature of monthly data that can go through revisions and seasonal adjustments. Floyd Norris, our columnist, says that seasonal adjustments in July may have overstated gains.
9:29 A.M. | Up in Europe
Just before the opening on Wall Street, stocks in Europe reversed initial losses and pushed higher after the stronger than expected United States labor report, my colleague in London, Matthew Saltmarsh, writes.
But as always, there was a word of caution. He quotes analysts warning that the gains could be temporary.
Still, as it did for stock futures in the United States, the jobs report provided a lift to battered stock markets in Europe, which have been sliding this week on fears about the economic outlook on both sides of Atlantic.
The broad Euro Stoxx 50 index reversed early losses and gained 1.6 percent. The DAX in Frankfurt added 0.2 percent and the French CAC 40 climbed 2 percent.
Safer assets like bonds, Treasuries and precious metals gave up some of their early gains.
"This may go someway to helping stabilize market sentiment," James Knightley, an economist at ING, said after the report.
8:58 A.M. | Green
Now there is a color we have not seen much of recently: Just after the jobless figures were released by the Labor Department, stock index futures flashed green, suggesting there might be something of a recovery at the Wall Street opening.
Dow industrial futures and those of the other main indexes had wallowed in the red all morning until the United States jobless report said that employers added 117,000 jobs in July, a number that was above analysts' expectations of 85,000.
Shortly after the report was released, Dow futures, as well as those of Standard & Poor's 500-stock index and the Nasdaq, turned up.
European indexes, meanwhile, remained mixed. Euro Stoxx 50 was up 17.98 points, while the FTSE 100 was lower at 38.41 points in London. The DAX was lower, while the CAC 40 in Paris was 33.35 higher.
8:47 A.M. | Wall Street Welcomes Jobs Figures
After the jobs report, stock index futures on Wall Street turned higher, with the Dow futures up 66 points.
8:41 A.M. | United States Adds 117,000 Jobs in July
The United States economy added 117,000 nonfarm jobs in July, beating expectations. The unemployment rate was 9.1 percent. 
8:11 A.M. | A Positive Sign
In the past half-hour, one gauge of how the New York markets will open has actually turned positive - the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index - albeit ever so slightly.
Dow futures have also improved marginally to a loss of 31 points, a vast improvement over the real dive on Thursday of 512.76 points.
European indexes, meanwhile, are showing a range of declines, from 0.5 percent for the Euro Stoxx 50 to 2.24 percent for the FTSE 100 in London. One hopeful sign: The Italian stock index has climbed 1.23 percent today.
8:03 A.M. | Next Step in Markets Today
Investors are awaiting the United States jobless report at 8:30 a.m. ET for guidance on whether global markets will worsen today. The consensus of the professionals is that the key figure - the number of new jobs created in July - will be around 85,000, so a number that drifts far higher or far lower could prompt market reaction. Another signal: Dow Jones industrial futures, traders' best guess at the New York opening, are trading down a mere 45 points. 
Later today, heads of state in Europe are expected to confer by phone as their stock markets ricochet, a reaction in part to a lack of consensus among European officials on how to best combat the debt crisis there. President Nicolas Sarkozy of France will confer with Angela Merkel, chancellor of Germany, and Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero of Spain.
Among the sea of numbers of note the day after the Dow's 4 percent rout: Bloomberg News notes that more than $4.5 trillion has been erased from the value of equities worldwide since July 26.
Looking for good news? Canada said this morning its unemployment rate dropped in July to its lowest since December 2008.

HEADLINE: A.I.G. Unit at Center of Financial Crisis Is Wound Down

BYLINE: MICHAEL J. DE LA MERCED


HIGHLIGHT: More than two years after protests outside its offices, A.I.G.'s Financial Products unit has finally been wound down -- and at a profit, not a big loss.

 BODY:
More than two years ago, fury over the financial crisis appeared to find a single target: an unassuming red-brick building in a suburban Connecticut office park.
There sat the headquarters of the American International Group's Financial Products unit, largely unknown until its imploding derivatives contracts portfolio threatened to sink the global banking system. And for many on Wall Street and in Washington, Wilton, Conn., was shorthand for the excesses of the credit bubble.
But this week, A.I.G. announced with little fanfare that it had finished its "active wind-down"of the unit, having slimmed down the portfolio to just over $198 billion from a peak of $2.7 trillion. A.I.G. executives say that even more importantly, the unwinding operation -- which was initially projected to cost at least $10 billion -- has instead yielded a $4 billion operating profit.
"There was no real benefit to getting it right," Robert H. Benmosche, A.I.G.'s chief executive, said in an interview on Friday from the insurer's harbor-side offices in Jersey City. "But there would have been a lot of pain in getting it wrong."
Friday marked the final official working day of Gerry Pasciucco, the chief operating officer of Financial Products, known informally as F.P. A former Morgan Stanley vice chairman, he was hired in 2008 by A.I.G.'s then-chief executive, Edward Liddy, with a mandate to dismantle F.P. within a year. (Read his resignation letter.)
Much of the work involved negotiating early terminations of contracts known as credit default swaps, derivatives that had been linked to subprime mortgages that had largely soured amid the housing downturn. Rising foreclosures had eventually led to A.I.G.'s needing to post some $15 billion in collateral, prompting an unprecedented government bailout.
But according to F.P.'s calculations, a quick dismantling of the unit could have cost A.I.G. $10 billion to $20 billion, Mr. Pasciucco said in an interview. 
An especially dangerous part of the portfolio was the unit's regulatory capital book, which held derivatives that helped European banks lower the amount of capital reserves required under international accords by about $400 billion.
"This was the largest unwinding of a derivatives portfolio ever attempted, with a lot of potential second- and third-order effects," he said. 
But from the onset of A.I.G.'s bailout in September 2008, F.P. drew political fire. Among the biggest targets were about $165 million in bonuses that it was set to pay out to its employees. By March of 2009, even the White House and New York's attorney general had attacked the payouts as untenable, as protesters trekked to the homes of F.P. executives to express their scorn.
The fight left the division's employees demoralized and angry, according to Mr. Pasciucco, threatening F.P.'s attempts to unwind the contracts with minimal losses. He spent much of the early part of his tenure persuading staffers to stay, despite most of them facing inevitable layoffs within a year's time.
"Gerry did a masterful job working with those people," Mr. Benmosche said.
Ultimately, the Obama administration's special master for compensation at bailed-out financial firms pressured A.I.G. to recover some $45 million from the division's executives. (A.I.G. recouped only a portion of those payouts.)
At the time, the justification in paying out the bonuses was that A.I.G. was legally obligated to pay out the contracts, which critics seized upon as weak reasoning. But Mr. Benmosche said on Friday that he would have simply argued that the employees, who drew the bulk of their compensation from the bonuses, deserved them. 
He added that the employees ultimately received less than what they were owed, since much of the bonuses had been deposited into deferred accounts that were later wiped out.
Many of the workers had not been involved in creating the contracts in the first place, he added.
Beyond the payouts, however, Mr. Pasciucco said unit still had a limited amount of time to handle a big undertaking. When Mr. Benmosche visited F.P. on his first official day as chief executive on Aug. 10, 2009, Mr. Pasciucco told him two things. One was that his new boss was the first A.I.G. chief executive to visit the division since Maurice R. Greenberg, who resigned from the insurer in 2005. 
The other was that his current mandate left him little room to avoid losses. "Some of the bids we received were literally, 'Give me some money to take the contract off your hands,'" Mr. Pasciucco said.
Within hours, Mr. Benmosche had changed F.P.'s mission and offered to give the team as much time as it needed to unwind the contracts with minimal losses.
That decision ran into opposition from multiple parties, notably the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, a senior lender to A.I.G. as part of the insurer's bailout. The New York Fed's main concern was being paid back as soon as possible, and the regulator maintained pressure as recently as the fourth quarter of last year, Mr. Benmosche said.
Jack Gutt, a spokesman for the New York Fed, declined to comment.
Mr. Benmosche and other top A.I.G. executives met with New York Fed officials every Wednesday morning to update them on F.P.'s progress.
By the end of the second quarter, however, F.P.'s portfolio consisted of about 2,200 derivative trade positions. Most of the division's employees will either be shown the door or folded into other A.I.G. units, primarily its capital markets division.
F.P.'s office space in London has been taken over by the insurer's asset management decision. And that red-brick office has become just another A.I.G. outpost.
As for his next step, Mr. Pasciucco said he hadn't decided what to do, and would take a short break first.
"Know of any companies in need of fixing?" he asked with a laugh.

HEADLINE: Podcast: Double-Dip Fears and Grab-and-Go Food

BYLINE: DAN NIEMI


HIGHLIGHT: A look at the latest Weekend Business podcast, and a listen.

 BODY:
August is off to a rocky start.
Despite an agreement to raise the debt ceiling just hours before the government's borrowing authority was set to run out, investors quickly switched their focus to the European debt crisis and weak prospects for the United States economy and pummeled stocks.
In the Weekend Business podcast, Floyd Norris, chief financial correspondent for The Times, discusses the possibility of a double-dip recession for the United States and the troubles plaguing Europe. In addition, he suggests that the unemployment report for July, which showed a better-than-expected gain of 117,000 jobs, could be overstating seasonal adjustments. 
One place where workers seem pretty happy is Pret A Manger, the British fast-food chain. Its annual work force turnover rate is about 60 percent - low for the fast-food industry, where the rate is normally 300 to 400 percent. As David Gillen discusses with Stephanie Clifford, the chain is slowly expanding in New York and other American cities with its own brand of grab-and-go food and, more significant, a fresh approach to service. At Pret, the goal is to serve customers within 60 seconds, and with maximum currency.
You can find specific segments of the podcast at these junctures: Floyd Norris (15:51); news headlines (10:52); Pret A Manger (8:28); the week ahead (0:58).
As articles discussed in the podcast are published during the weekend, links will be added to this post.

HEADLINE: On the Shark Beat

BYLINE: ANDREW C. REVKIN


HIGHLIGHT: A seasoned political reporter turns her back on Capitol Hill's predators and dives in with real sharks.

 BODY:
Juliet Eilperin, a Washington Post reporter who shifted in 2004 from covering Congress and politics to writing on the environment, has written "Demon Fish", a captivating, world-spanning (and much praised) exploration of the difficult human relationship with sharks. I recently had an e-mail exchange with Eilperin* about the book and her reporting adventures. With Shark Week nearing an end (I still think what's needed is Human Week), this seemed an appropriate time to post our Q&A. Here it is, with some shorthand cleaned up: 
Q.
I was fascinated at first, but then not surprised, to read the details of how President George W. Bush, thanks to Jean-Michel Cousteau, produced what might be one of the biggest victories for sharks ever. How would you cast the importance of his decision on the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands National Monument
A.
I think that decision was pivotal, in terms of setting a precedent that countries need to protect the ecologically rich, vast swaths of the sea from exploitation. Bush not only followed this up by creating large marine reserves in the Marianas Trench and the Line Islands, but other world leaders have followed suit in Britain's Chagos Islands and Chile's Sala y Gomez preserve. So his move has reverberated across the globe.
Q.
My one close encounter with a shark in the water was unforgettably unnerving, even though it was a small reef shark. I was snorkeling along the drop-off on a fringing reef outside a harbor on a small island in Fiji (where, i later learned, there was a tuna cannery). I crossed a deep natural cut in the coral wall and a shark was commuting back out to sea through that cut, and right toward me. It twitched. I remember watching its dorsal fin twitching as it hesitated, shifted course, then shot past me to open water. What moment with a shark caught your attention most deeply?
A.
The first time I jumped into the water with sharks off Triangle Rocks in Bimini was unforgettable. There were so many sharks, coming at me from all different directions, that it was almost overwhelming. But it was beautiful at the same time, and since I survived, it convinced me I needed to do it again.
Q.
Can humans have a kind of primordial "enemy" relationship with something and still really work to conserve it? Have you seen any place where the passion to conserve has most outweighed the profit motive and/or fear factor?
A.
There are several places where this is happening, actually, though there's always a profit motive involved. Shark tourism is a driving force behind the economies of Isla Holbox in Mexico, Hermanus, South Africa, and in the Maldives, Palau and the Bahamas. So in those communities, local people have opted for shark conservation out of economic self interest.
Q.
Do you see any real prospect that the Chinese trade in fins will ebb?
A.
I think at some point we will reach a tipping point where shark's fin soup will fall out of favor, and the trade will decline. The issue is I just can't predict when we will reach that point.
Q.
Eugenie Clark was a hero of mine as a teenager and her books were probably one factor drawing me toward marine biology (before I wised up and pursued science writing instead of science). Did you come late to this realm of marine wonders or did anything steer you in this direction as a kid or young adult?
A.
I've always enjoying swimming in lakes and in the ocean. But I didn't focus on the sea until I switched beats in 2004, and Roger Rufe (who headed the Ocean Conservancy at the time) told me I needed to refresh my diving skills if I was going to cover the ocean. I took his advice, and never regretted it.
Q.
What shark would you be glad never to see, and which of the species you have not seen is on your wish list to observe?
A.
I have no desire to see a bull shark in person, though I have seen one shortly after getting out of the water. I'd love to see a cookie cutter shark taking a cookie-shaped chomp out of a swordfish or equally-large predator. And I still intend to see hammerhead sharks gathered off Cocos Island during mating season, when all the females are swimming together and the males are fighting to make their way into to hook up with the alpha females.

HEADLINE: Is Less Defense the Best Offense?

BYLINE: CLAY RISEN


HIGHLIGHT: Can the nation live with a smaller defense budget? Does it even need to?

 BODY:
"Disastrous." "Unacceptable." "Doomsday." "This is the Pentagon's worst nightmare." What is it? Another 9/11? North Korea nuking Seoul? Nope - try budget cuts.
After seeing its budget increase 110 percent since 2001, the Department of Defense is facing what both its defenders and critics are calling a new age of austerity. In the default-averting deal worked out at the start of the week, the federal government will cut $900 billion in spending over the next decade, with some $350 billion coming from security spending.
But what really has folks up in arms, so to speak, is what happens next. A six-person "supercommittee" has until Thanksgiving to find another $1.5 trillion in cuts over the next decade; if it doesn't, then $1.2 trillion in across-the-board cuts will kick in, the so-called sequester mechanism, with half coming from defense spending.
In a letter posted on the Pentagon Web site, Leon E. Panetta, the new secretary of defense, wrote:
In the past, such as after the Vietnam War, our government applied cuts to defense across the board, resulting in a force that was undersized and underfunded relative to its missions and responsibilities. This process has historically led to outcomes that weaken rather than strengthen our national security - and which ultimately cost our nation more when it must quickly rearm to confront new threats...
We expect that the responsible transitions in Iraq and Afghanistan will help reduce total U.S. defense spending over the coming years. But I will do everything I can to ensure that further reductions in defense spending are not pursued in a hasty, ill-conceived way that would undermine the military's ability to protect America and its vital interests around the globe. For example, the debt ceiling agreement contains a sequester mechanism that would take effect if Congress fails to enact further deficit reduction. If that happens, it could trigger a round of dangerous across-the-board defense cuts that would do real damage to our security, our troops and their families, and our ability to protect the nation.
But many Washington hawks were less willing to accept even the upfront hit the Pentagon will take. John R. Bolton, the former ambassador to the United Nations, wrote on the Web site Decide America that "Defense has already taken hugely disproportionate cuts under President Obama, and there is simply no basis for expanding those cuts further." Frank Gaffney, a defense expert, echoed Mr. Bolton in an online column for National Review: "Under President Obama, the Defense Department's budget has already been reduced by some $430 billion. Now, thanks to this 'compromise,' the security portfolios will be reduced by a further $350 billion in the first round of cuts."
Other commentators, however, pointed out that the $350 billion in new cuts would simply replace the earlier $400 billion to $430 billion in cuts mentioned by Mr. Bolton and Mr. Gaffney, rather than add to them - meaning that the Defense Department was actually in a better position, fiscally speaking, than it was last week.
What's more, even the first round of cuts are less ominous than they seem, as Jacob J. Lew, the head of the Office of Management and Budget, made clear in an Aug. 4 blog post:
The agreement reduces discretionary security spending in FY 2012 by $4 billion as measured from FY 2011, and then only increases that reduced amount by $2 billion in FY 2013. After that, security spending (and non-security savings, for that matter) is projected to increase by about 2 percent a year. Overall, this new funding path will generate about $420 billion in savings over the next 10 years compared to CBO baseline levels. Compared to the Administration's FY 2012 long-term plan (which included growth above current services), this new path will save some $600 billion, including about $500 billion from national defense, most of which would come from the Department of Defense.
Put more simply, the deal doesn't actually cut any current spending - it simply puts a limit on future, projected spending. That may be cold comfort to defense planners, but it's hardly as bad as some make it out to be.
What's more, as Mr. Lew makes clear in the same post, there is an important distinction between "defense" spending and "security" spending. Defense means, more or less, the Pentagon; security means the Pentagon plus Homeland Security, foreign aid and a variety of other functions. True, defense is still the biggest item by far, but there's a lot of wiggle room to cut other spending items without harming defense money.
This has led some observers to cry foul on the whole thing. Russell Rumbaugh at the blog The Will and the Wallet, which focuses on defense spending issues, wrote,
Defense spending made out pretty well in the debt deal. Despite all of the claims, the only immediate impact of the deal on defense is the FY12 and FY13 cap on "security," which includes DoD, NNSA [the National Nuclear Security Administration], function 150 international affairs, the intelligence community management account, and the Departments of Homeland Security and Veterans Affairs. The FY12 security cap is $5B lower than the final FY11 discretionary number for security. So even if DoD ate all of that reduction it would be less than a 1 percent cut from FY11.
The White House is claiming $350B in defense savings, presumably by extrapolating out from the FY12 and FY 13 caps. But that is an assumption. Nothing in the deal mandates those savings.
The real debate, though, is about the yet-to-be-named budget committee and where it decides to make further cuts. Mr. Panetta, for one, was quoted in a Times article as saying that the Pentagon should be exempt from more spending reductions, and that the focus should be on tax increases and entitlement reform:
Let me for a moment put a budget hat on You cannot deal with the size deficits that this country is confronting by simply cutting the discretionary side of the budget. That represents less than a third of the overall federal budget.
You've got to, as the president's made clear, if you're going to look at those size deficits, you've got to look at the mandatory side of the budget, which is two-thirds of the federal budget. And you also have to look at revenues as part of that answer.
Fareed Zakaria, editor at large for Time, on the other hand, sees this as a great opportunity to bring American military spending in line with what he sees as the country's long-term interests. Writing in The Washington Post on Aug. 3, he said,
Let the guillotine fall. It would be a much-needed adjustment to an out-of-control military-industrial complex . The Pentagon's budget has risen for 13 years, which is unprecedented. Between 2001 and 2009, overall spending on defense rose from $412 billion to $699 billion, a 70 percent increase, which is larger than in any comparable period since the Korean War. Including the supplementary spending on Iraq and Afghanistan, we spent $250 billion more than average U.S. defense expenditures during the Cold War - a time when the Soviet, Chinese and Eastern European militaries were arrayed against the United States and its allies. Over the past decade, when we had no serious national adversaries, U.S. defense spending has gone from about a third of total worldwide defense spending to 50 percent. In other words, we spend more on defense than the planet's remaining countries put together.
The very next day, however, Michael E. O'Hanlon of the Brookings Institution took to the pages of the same publication to argue against Mr. Zakaria's "cavalier" attitude toward defense cuts:
Zakaria is right that U.S. defense spending has grown greatly over the past decade. Even after factoring out the effects of inflation, annual spending has risen from just over $400 billion to about $700 billion. But almost $200 billion of that growth is for the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, and those budgets are headed down already. Estimated 2012 expenses are about 40 percent less than the recent peak yearly level. The downward trend will continue as most or all remaining U.S. forces exit Iraq this year and the number of American troops in Afghanistan declines by a third by next year, with further cuts likely to follow soon thereafter.
Mr. O'Hanlon's words were underlined by Representative Duncan L. Hunter, Republican of California, who wrote in Politico that the strain of fighting in extreme environments in Iraq and Afghanistan had left the military with equipment in desperate need of replacing or refurbishing:
These cuts come when each service is already facing heavy operational requirements, with three wars and significant readiness gaps.
The signs of nearly a decade of combat and aging inventory are evident in each branch. Today, for example, barely half the Air Force fighter aircraft units are fully mission-capable, and that branch is likely to face an 800-jet shortfall in the next few years.
In fact, an F-15 fighter jet recently broke in half because of fatigue crack. Fuselage cracks also routinely plague the aging inventory of A-10 aircraft.
For the Marine Corps, its amphibious vehicles are more than 35 years old and can no longer fulfill their expeditionary mission. The Navy is well below the minimum number of ships required to sustain its readiness capabilities.
Each of these examples underscores why now is not the time to cut defense spending. We are a nation at war - fighting on multiple fronts. Significant reset burdens are not going away, and new threats continue to emerge. It's crucial that our military stay ready- which is near impossible with an anemic defense budget.
Perhaps the most thoughtful statement, however, came from Andrew M. Exum, a former Army Ranger in Iraq and Afghanistan and now a senior fellow at the Center for a New American Security, who wrote on his blog:
Most of us defense analysts, though, can agree that whatever happened last night and in the budget negotiations, cuts to the defense budget were inevitable and even make sense. As we draw down in Iraq and Afghanistan, it's a perfectly reasonable thing to wonder why we have as many ground troops as we do, and it's also a perfectly reasonable thing to wonder why retirement benefits in the military outpace those in the private sector or why health care premiums are so low for servicemen while they continue to rise for everyone else. So I have no problems with intelligent cuts to the defense budget, though I do have problems with blind swipes of the ax to the defense budget, and I worry we're going to see more of the latter than the former.
But, Mr. Exum cautioned, there are smart ways and there are dumb ways to cut defense spending:
Here's the thing, though: if defense hawks want to prevent other law-makers from gutting the defense budget in a clumsy way, they should play offense instead of defense. The path of least resistance now will be to fight some valiant rear-guard action protecting this or that weapons system, but the smarter play will be to convince other law-makers and the public at large that it makes more sense to re-invest in our nation's exhausted military for the next few years than to continue to fund entitlement schemes that we are going to need to eventually cut anyway. And it might even make sense for someone to suggest we all pay an extra $20 "thank you tax" to our nation's Army and Marine Corps this year to replace some of the equipment those soldiers and Marines have used in Iraq and Afghanistan while most of the rest of us have sat on the couch eating Cheetos and worrying about the NFL lock-out. I think most Americans would be down with that - if they were assured this extra $20 would go to our exhausted Army and Marine Corps.
Because if you want to fix the debt, you're going to have to eventually raise taxes and cut entitlements anyway. You might as well do so now in the name of national security rather than wait until the next crisis.
Sadly, if the nail-biter ending to the debt-ceiling impasse is any indicator, waiting until the next crisis is the only way Washington knows how to deal with things.

HEADLINE: Debt Deal Could Be a Job-Killer For Incumbents

BYLINE: NATE SILVER


HIGHLIGHT: Their vote on the debt ceiling deal could be trouble for House incumbents running for re-election in districts deemed competitive in November.

 BODY:
Initial public reaction to the deficit-reducing deal reached by President Obama and Congress is fairly poor. Although there is some variance from survey to survey, on average approval of the deal registers at 38 percent against 49 percent disapproval across four national polls conducted on it so far.
The numbers are quite similar to polls conducted in 2010 on the Democrats' health care bill, which almost certainly cost some Democrats their seats in Congress.
Unlike the health care bill, however, or the financial bailout in 2008, the debt deal was agreed to overwhelmingly by Congressional incumbents running in swing seats. Of the 63 Republicans running for re-election to the House in districts that the nonpartisan Cook Political Report deems competitive, 56 of them, or 89 percent, voted for the deal.
Democrats have fewer members running in swing districts in the House, simply because they lost so many of them in 2010. Still, among Democrats who are running in competitive races, the tally was 23-to-14 in favor of the bill, whereas the majority of Democrats in safe districts voted against it.
We get the same story if we look at the votein the Senate. All but two senators running in competitive races -- Ben Nelson, Democrat of Nebraska, and Dean Heller, Republican of Nevada -- voted for the bill.
One question is whether the members of Congress who voted for the bill did so because they actually thought it would be electorally advantageous -- or because it was more in line with their ideological leanings. In both parties, the bill triggered more opposition from the wings than from moderates.
In the House, members of the liberal Congressional Progressive Caucus overwhelmingly voted against the bill, with 56 of the 70 members voted opposing it, while other Democrats voted for the bill by roughly a 2-1 margin. A 32-to-28 majority of Republicans in the Tea Party Caucus, meanwhile, voted the bill -- but they were less likely to do so than other Republicans in the House, who approved the bill by a 72-to-19 margin.
Since relatively few members of both the Tea Party Caucus and the Congressional Progressive Caucus are in competitive seats, the greater propensity of members in swing districts to support the bill could plausibly reflect ideological differences rather than differing views on electoral strategy.
For Republicans in the House, however, the differences persist even if you account for affiliation with the Tea Party. Among Republicans affiliated with Tea Party, 91 percent of those in competitive districts voted for the bill, while 62 percent of those not running in competitive races did. Of the nine members of the Tea Party Caucus who are running in competitive races, meanwhile, seven voted for the bill -- while a bare majority of Tea Party Caucus members serving in districts that are not expected to be competitive next November voted against it.
For Republicans, in other words, both ideological and electoral factors were in play. Relatively moderate Republicans were more likely to vote for the bill -- but, also, those in competitive districts were more likely to vote for the bill than those in safe districts, even after controlling for this.
For Democrats, on the other hand, splits in the vote were primarily accounted for by ideological differences.
Around 80 percent of Democrats in the Congressional Progressive Caucus voted against the bill, while two-thirds of the remaining Democrats voted for it. Once this is accounted for, however, there were essentially no differences in the voting patterns based on district competitiveness. Excluding members of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, about two-thirds of Democrats in competitive seats voted for the bill -- but so did about two-thirds of Democrats in safe seats.
So Democrats appear to have viewed the bill as something of a wash electorally, while Republicans in competitive districts seemed to go out of their way to vote for it.
There are a variety of plausible explanations for why Republicans voted this way. Districts which are competitive in the general election are not usually competitive in the primary, and vice versa. So the greater tendency of Republicans in competitive general election races to vote for the bill may have reflected a lack of concern about primary challenges, rather than some perceived advantage in the general election.
Still, the bill wound up passing the House with some margin to spare, 53 yea votes. In the Senate, all members running in competitive races could have voted against the bill and it would still have received the 60 votes necessary to overcome a filibuster.
When deals like this are reached, they usually poll well, at least initially. But it's not hard to see why this deal is an exception. The process that led up to it was ugly, leading to record-high disapproval ratings for Congress in New York Times/CBS New polls and other surveys. (There is some evidence that this represents a real danger both to incumbents in general and to Republicans in particular.) And both the final deal, and all the deals that were proposed before it, were roundly trashed by partisans on all sides.
This is another way in which the debt ceiling debate resembled the health care debate. If voters spend months hearing overwhelmingly negative things about the various proposals, it's going to be hard for them to turn on a dime and declare the deal that emerges to be a winner.
But it's also worth keeping in mind that the final deal was not well aligned with public opinion. Voters overwhelmingly supported a mix of tax increases and spending cuts as part of the deal, something they did not get.
It's true that, in general, tax increases don't poll very well. Who knows how many elections Republicans have won over the years by campaigning against them. But the public's views on this are not as monolithic as those of, say, Grover Norquist. The types of tax increases that were proposed as part of the deal, like higher rates for those making more than $250,000 per year, poll quite well -- even among Republicans. And although the public might prefer spending cuts to tax increases, they prefer a mix of both to an imbalanced deal. It may be that members of Congress -- but especially the Republicans in swing districts who were overwhelmingly likely to vote for the bill -- relied on an oversimplified view of public opinion.
Instead, the reasons for the public's objection to the bill are reasonably complex. It's likely that at least some significant fraction of the public disliked the deal for the following reasons:
-- The bill did not cut spending enough.-- The bill led to dangerous cuts in national defense.-- The bill led to dangerous cuts in Medicare.-- The bill weakened the economy, and failed to address the problem of job losses.-- The bill raised the debt ceiling without ensuring long-term fiscal stability, especially in entitlement programs.-- The bill played games with the full faith and credit of the United States.-- The bill failed to raise taxes on high-income earners, balancing the budget on the back of the poor.-- The bill opens the door to cuts in entitlement programs through the special commission.-- The bill opens the door to tax increases through the special commission.-- The bill represented a capitulation to the terrible, horrible, no-good Tea Party.-- The bill represented a capitulation to the terrible, horrible, no-good president.
Some of these objections, of course, are self-contradictory -- and some have more of a ring of truth than others. But all are likely to make their way in some form into campaign commercials against members of Congress who voted for the bill, whether in the primaries or the general election.
This also gets at why an unpopular bill is likely to be more of a threat to members of Congress than to President Obama, even though he also endorsed the compromise. Challengers can pick and choose their critiques from this menu based on what might resonate the most in a particular district. But because the presidential campaign takes place at a national level, the Republican candidate will probably be limited to just a couple of these themes. There may nevertheless be some risk for Mr. Obama -- but he'll face less of a moving target. In addition, the polls suggest that the public tends to assign more responsibility for the deal to the Republican Congress than to the White House.
Nor is it clear that Mr. Obama's support for the compromise will prevent Democratic challengers for Congress from running against it. Since Mr. Obama's approval ratings are mediocre, his endorsement of the deal may even be a bug rather than a feature. Democratic candidates can run against the fairly unpopular Mr. Obama and the extremely unpopular Republican Congress at the same time.
Finally, keep in mind that critiques about the substance of the deal will come on top of critiques about the process -- which will apply to virtually all incumbents, whether they voted for the deal or not.
Anti-incumbent sentiment is probably stronger now than at any point since polling began. We don't know exactly how that is going to play out, and to some extent we are in uncharted territory.
But the polling so far suggests that the risks are particularly acute for Congress -- and even more acute for the Republicans in Congress, who were more likely to vote for the bill and are being assigned more responsibility for it by the public.

HEADLINE: Obama's One Economic Upside Heads Down

BYLINE: MICHAEL D. SHEAR


HIGHLIGHT: For more than a year, the president could point to the stock market as a sign of economic progress. Until this week.

 BODY:
For more than a year, there has been one economic indicator that President Obama could always count on as a good-news salve to the festering sore of grim unemployment and jobs data. 
Until now, the stock market - and more specifically, the Dow Jones Industrial Average - had been on a long, steady increase for the last year, adding nearly 3,000 points, an increase of almost 30 percent, between June 30, 2010, and July 22, 2011.
Since Mr. Obama took office, the market has gained steadily even as the overall economy has sputtered along and job growth has remained anemic.
But in the last two weeks, the market has suffered an abrupt correction, giving back nearly 1,300 points on the Dow - more than 500 of them on Thursday alone. 
Politically speaking, the news couldn't come at a worse time for Mr. Obama. The weeks-long battle over the debt ceiling has pushed his approval numbers down, especially where the economy is concerned.
Economic growth has slowed to a crawl. And the private sector is producing almost no jobs every month. A new jobs report to be released Friday morning is expected to show little progress toward getting Americans back to work.
Which leaves Mr. Obama and his top aides little to crow about as he begins to ramp up his reelection campaign.
The stock market is fickle, of course. It could go up again as quickly as it went down on Thursday. The president and his top aides have always been careful not to claim credit for a short-term increase, nor worry publicly too much about a momentary drop.
But a review of Mr. Obama's speeches, and those of his top economic advisers, over the past two years reveals that the success of the stock market had become a staple of Mr. Obama's stump speech.
On April 1, 2010, at a fundraiser in Boston, Mr. Obama joked that he wasn't getting the credit he deserved for the performance of the stock market, which hit a high for the prior year that day.
"You guys may remember last March, when the stock market was bottoming out - 'this is Obama's stock market,'" Mr. Obama said. "And I notice it's not my market anymore. I don't know what happened. You notice that?"
Now, it's his market again.
In a speech in Buffalo the next month, Mr. Obama was more cautious, but still managed to point out the market's gains.
"It's great that the stock market has bounced back," he said, "but if you're still looking for a job out there, it's still a recession."
And in Mr. Obama's State of the Union speech in January, the stock market was one of the key indicators that he pointed to as evidence that the economy - while still struggling - was ripe for a strong recovery.
"We are poised for progress," he said. "Two years after the worst recession most of us have ever known, the stock market has come roaring back. Corporate profits are up. The economy is growing again."
As recently as April of this year, Mr. Obama was touting the stock market. During a fund-raiser at the Waldorf Astoria in New York, Mr. Obama said that "the stock market is almost fully recovered. The financial system has stabilized. And people have a sense that this recovery may finally start building some steam."
If the stock market was a political asset for Mr. Obama while it was going up, that could mean it's a political liability for him while it's going down.
In an email to reporters on Thursday morning - before the market's 512-point slide - the Republican National Committee listed 50 numbers for Mr. Obama to ponder. (Thursday was Mr. Obama's 50th birthday.)
Among the numbers were the $14.3 trillion debt; the $1.42 trillion deficit for 2009; the $831 billion stimulus program that Mr. Obama pushed through Congress; and the 1.8 million jobs the Republicans say were lost since the stimulus was passed.
What they didn't note was the stock market.
But by Thursday evening, the Republicans had seized on the stock market decline as a political weapon. In an email, the R.N.C. quoted Mr. Obama's State of the Union message about the market "roaring back," and stated that the last time the stock market declined for nine straight sessions was during Jimmy Carter's presidency.
(In fact, the Dow, which closed up slightly on Wednesday to break a losing streak, has not declined nine times in a row under Mr. Obama.)
It's possible, of course, that the stock market decline is viewed by the public as divorced from Mr. Obama's political fortunes.
My colleague at The Times, Nate Silver, noted Thursday that the stock market crash of October 1987 had very little immediate impact on the approval ratings of President Ronald Reagan, as measured by Gallup.
But Mr. Obama's problem is not one of the immediate reaction of polls. The challenge for his political advisers is how to construct a long-term narrative about Mr. Obama's successful efforts to improve the economy despite the torrent of bad news that seems to arrive every day.
The stock market has seemed impervious to that news for most of Mr. Obama's term - and that meant it could play a starring role in the narrative during the next 15 months.
If the decline of the last week is an aberration fueled by economic uncertainty abroad, it could end up as a minor blip for Mr. Obama politically. The stock market - even after the recent declines wiped out its gains for the year so far - remains well above where it started on the day Mr. Obama was inaugurated.
On the other hand, a continued decline would feed the already negative perception that people have about the economy.
And that would not be good for Mr. Obama.

HEADLINE: U.S. Reports Solid Job Growth, A Bit of Relief Amid Grim Data

BYLINE: By MOTOKO RICH

 BODY:
The United States economy continues on a wobbly course, but there was a momentary sigh of relief on Friday as the government reported that employers added 117,000 jobs last month, slightly more than expected.
While hardly robust enough to produce a substantial change in the employment picture, the jobs growth calmed investors who feared that the stock market plunge on Thursday might pick up speed if the number had signaled a worsening of the already weak economic outlook.
Hours after the market closed, however, the economy was dealt a new blow when Standard & Poor's downgraded the United States credit rating to AA+, from AAA. The move reflected the agency's growing concern over the high level of federal debt.
During the day stocks seesawed before ending the session mixed, with investors wavering between encouragement over the jobs number and disappointment that the world's economies were not on firmer footing. 
Europe, in particular, is struggling to control a debt crisis that began in its smaller countries and now threatens the much bigger economies of Italy and Spain. A flurry of phone calls among European leaders led to announcements in Italy and elsewhere that reforms would be speeded up, though worries remain widespread that markets could resume their sharp fall if concrete steps to give financial support to Italy and Spain are not taken next week.
Those who have been waiting for the United States economy to move into high gear took little comfort in Friday's jobs report from the Labor Department, even though it was better than the previous months, whose job gains were revised slightly upward to 46,000 in June and 53,000 in May.
Companies added 154,000 jobs in July, but state and local governments continued to backslide, shedding 39,000 jobs. The federal government added 2,000 jobs. The unemployment rate slipped a notch to 9.1 percent, from 9.2 percent in June, but that was mainly because some people had simply given up looking for work.
The news tempered, but did not silence, talk of a double-dip recession. ''It gives us some temporary relief,'' said Nigel Gault, chief United States economist at IHS Global Insight. ''I suspect, though, that relief will probably not last too long as people refocus on what they think will happen in the future.''
Economists are now worried about the reduction in government spending outlined in the Congressional deal this week to raise the country's debt ceiling. Deep divisions remain between the two political parties on how to cut spending further at a time when many analysts worry that the economy can ill afford it.
Speaking at the Washington Navy Yard as he announced new programs for returning veterans from the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, President Obama called for Congress to extend the payroll tax credit and emergency unemployment insurance, measures that are scheduled to expire at the end of this year.
''There's no contradiction between us taking some steps to put people to work right now and getting our long-term fiscal house in order,'' Mr. Obama said. ''In fact, the more we grow, the easier it will be to reduce our deficits.''
Other signs that the recovery has slowed to a crawl are mounting. The Commerce Department reported this week that consumer spending, which accounts for up to 70 percent of economic activity, actually declined in June for the first time in nearly two years.
A closely watched survey of manufacturers showed that employment in July grew at a slower rate than in June and that new orders of factory goods fell. Companies like Merck, Cisco and Boston Scientific have all announced layoffs in recent weeks. Housing prices are still extremely weak.
Jan Kokes, president of Kokes Family Home Builders, which creates residential communities for 55-and-over buyers in Ocean County, N.J., said that his staff had shrunk to 87 from a peak of 220 in 2007. With average home sales down to just 30 a year from 200, he said, he has no plans to hire. ''There really aren't any jobs in the construction industry right now,'' he said.
The typical precursors to increased hiring remained sluggish. Average weekly hours worked, which tend to rise as a sign that employers are maximizing their current staff, were flat in the latest month, and average weekly earnings nudged up only slightly.
In temporary help, which often ticks up as employers prepare to expand, there were no net new jobs in July.
Tig Gilliam, chief executive of the Adecco Group North America, said that while information technology, engineering and some other industry sectors were seeking more temporary workers, some others, like government and the mortgage industry, were not. ''It's the story of growers and shrinkers,'' Mr. Gilliam said.
Austan Goolsbee, departing chairman of the President's Council of Economic Advisers, said there was no question that rising oil prices and the shocks rippling out of the disaster in Japan had hindered United States growth and hiring. But he said government's role was now to give the private sector incentives to hire, calling for Congress to pass trade measures, set up an infrastructure bank and pass patent reform.
With extended unemployment benefits scheduled to expire at the end of this year, 13.9 million people remain out of work, 6.2 million of whom have been searching for jobs for six months or longer.
An additional 8.4 million are working part time because they cannot find a full-time job, and 1.1 million have become so discouraged that they have stopped looking for work altogether. Including such people, the broader measure of unemployment was 16.1 percent in July.
In a sobering note, only 58.1 percent of the population is working, the lowest level in nearly three decades.
Mabel, a 54-year-old unemployed clerical worker in Pinetop, Ariz., who did not want her last name published for fear of putting off prospective employers, said she had been looking for work since being laid off in 2009. She is more frantic now as her unemployment benefits ran out in June.
''It's like when you go and talk to people and ask, 'Oh, do you have a job?,' they say, 'Oh no, my dear, we don't have anything,' '' she said. '' 'Everything is so hard, it's just the economy.' I don't know if anything is ever going to change.''
Since the recovery officially began two years ago, economists have been cautioning that it would take years to get back to full employment, given the depth of the financial crisis. With options for government aid now severely restricted by the political environment, said Steven Ricchiuto, chief economist at Mizuho Securities USA, ''once you've frittered away all your opportunities, all that's left is time.''

HEADLINE: Crises Reach Across Borders: Wall Street Is Shaken as Signs Point to Economic Weakness Ahead

BYLINE: By GRAHAM BOWLEY and CHRISTINE HAUSER; Julie Creswell contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Like a battered boxer, stocks were knocked down and kept dragging themselves up through trading Friday, closing flat in the end, but capping the worst weekly decline since November 2008.
After Thursday's painful rout, the market swung more than 400 points on Friday as nervous investors were buffeted by news about the weak United States economy and Europe's debt problems. The decision late Friday by the ratings agency Standard & Poor's to downgrade United States long-term debt, dropping it one level from AAA to AA+, was likely to ensure that nervousness continues into next week.
At the close of trading on Friday, which came before the downgrade, the broader market as measured by the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index ended down 0.69 points at 1,199.38, for a drop of 7.1 percent over the week. 
With talk of a recession hanging over the markets, many investors still think they have further to fall. Already, attention is turning to the Federal Reserve meeting next week, and whether it will take more steps to mend what appears to be a weakening economy.
''There is no sign of momentum turning higher,'' said David Sneddon, a technical analyst at Credit Suisse, adding that the S.& P. 500 could head as low as 1,100.
Ciaran O'Kelly, head of United States equities at Nomura, said he saw ''some serious issues going forward,'' noting downward revisions last month to the gross domestic product of the United States.
''G.D.P. forecasts are being slashed. There is a very real possibility of a recession in 2012 or 2013,'' Mr. O'Kelly said. ''Earnings models are now being reassessed across all sectors and consequently valuations are tumbling. It is a total re-evaluation.''
After stocks took a battering in Asia and Europe, the market traded higher at the opening in the United States on better-than-expected jobs numbers.
The United States economy added 117,000 jobs in July, hardly robust, but not as terrible as some people had expected. It led to a sigh of relief that the terrible day that some had expected after the worst drubbing in two years in markets on Thursday might not be so awful.
Later in the morning, stocks turned decisively downward, as investors continued to readjust their expectations of economic growth.
By noon, the S.& P. 500 was down 32 points, or 2.6 percent.
Only in the afternoon, when rumors began to swirl that the European Central Bank was preparing to intervene to support bond markets in Italy or Spain, did the market begin to recover.
The announcement by Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi of Italy that he was prepared to accelerate measures to get the government's spending under control also lifted investor confidence.
The fears that European governments were not doing enough to address their economic problems had been a major worry hanging over markets.
European stocks zigzagged as well. In Britain, the FTSE 100 ended down 2.71 percent. The DAX in Frankfurt moved briefly into positive territory then fell again, ending down 2.78 percent. The French CAC 40 was off 1.26 percent. Yields on Italian and Spanish government bonds, which have risen sharply in recent weeks, suggesting their debt situations are worsening, dipped on Friday. But they remained above 6 percent.
In the United States, the Dow Jones industrial average eked out a positive close at 11,444.61, up 60.93 points, or 0.54 percent. It was down 5.7 percent for the week, shedding 698.63 points, making it the largest point decline on the index since the week ending Oct. 10, 2008.
The Nasdaq composite index was down 23.98 points, or 0.94 percent, to 2,532.41.
Treasury yields rose after sinking for several sessions. The Treasury's benchmark 10-year note fell 1 12/32, to 104 27/32. The yield rose to 2.56 percent from 2.41 percent late Thursday.
But analysts said the trend toward lower Treasury yields was likely to continue as investors looked for safe havens.
''Despite what everybody says, the concept of a safe haven is still U.S. Treasuries,'' said Clemente Cappello, the chief investment officer of Sturgeon Capital, a $35 million hedge fund that invests in emerging markets in London.
Mr. O'Kelly said most of the moves upward were caused by short-covering and there had been little buying by investors.
He said one worrying trend was that whereas in the past investors bought on dips, few were willing to commit in the falling market because they had been burned by their experience in the financial crisis in 2008.
There were some signs of stress in United States credit markets. Otis Casey, a credit analyst at Markit, said interest rates on investment grade corporate debt had widened -- suggesting investors had revised upward their estimate of corporate credit risk in the light of the weaker economy.
As might be expected with the talk of recession and concern about fiscal distress, financial stocks were among the worst hit of all the sectors on the S.& P.
Bank of America and Citigroup were widely traded and were down more than 7 percent and nearly 4 percent, respectively.
Consumer staples, on the other hand, were up 1.63 percent.
''If the sentiment in the next couple of months pulls away from the recession cliff, financials could bounce,'' said James W. Paulsen, chief investment strategist for Wells Capital Management.
It was not clear just who was buying on Friday. Mr. Paulsen said he did not think the participants in the market included retail buyers, perhaps scared off by the plummet the previous day.

HEADLINE: The Decade of Lost Children

BYLINE: By CHARLES M. BLOW

 BODY:
One of the greatest casualties of the great recession may well be a decade of lost children.
According to ''The State of America's Children 2011,'' a report issued last month by the Children's Defense Fund, the impact of the recession on children's well-being has been catastrophic. 
Here is just a handful of the findings:
The number of children living in poverty has increased by four million since 2000, and the number of children who fell into poverty between 2008 and 2009 was the largest single-year increase ever recorded.
The number of homeless children in public schools increased 41 percent between the 2006-7 and 2008-9 school years.
In 2009, an average of 15.6 million children received food stamps monthly, a 65 percent increase over 10 years.
A majority of children in all racial groups and 79 percent or more of black and Hispanic children in public schools cannot read or do math at grade level in the fourth, eighth or 12th grades.
The annual cost of center-based child care for a 4-year-old is more than the annual in-state tuition at a public four-year college in 33 states and the District of Columbia.
Grim data, indeed. And there is no sign that things will get better anytime soon.
As a report issued last week by the nonpartisan Center on Budget and Policy Priorities points out: ''Of the 47 states with newly enacted budgets, 38 or more states are making deep, identifiable cuts in K-12 education, higher education, health care, or other key areas in their budgets for fiscal year 2012. Even as states face rising numbers of children enrolled in public schools, students enrolled in universities, and seniors eligible for services, the vast majority of states (37 of 44 states for which data are available) plan to spend less on services in 2012 than they spent in 2008 -- in some cases, much less. These cuts will slow the nation's economic recovery and undermine efforts to create jobs over the next year.''
We risk the creation of an engorged generational underclass born of a culture that has less income equality and fewer prospects for mobility than the previous generation.
It's hard to see how we emerge from this downturn and its tumult a stronger nation if we allow vast swatches of our children to be lost. My fear is that we may not.

HEADLINE: No Better in Europe

 BODY:
We were hopeful last month that Europe's leaders had bought themselves and the global economy time to address the fundamental economic problems eroding the finances and credibility of the 17-nation euro zone. 
As it has turned out, it took less than two weeks for markets to decide that the European Union's latest debt relief plan was too slow-acting and underfinanced, and still based more on words than on actions.
Europe's leaders -- who wasted more than a year dithering as Greece unraveled -- need to urgently mobilize the Continent's full financial resources to broaden the thin private market for Italian and Spanish bonds. That could help drive down Italian and Spanish borrowing costs so that these much bigger economies will not also be pushed toward catastrophic defaults, bringing many of Europe's banks down with them.
Even astute crisis management won't be enough. Europe's leaders must also face up to the euro zone's deeper problems, including excessive trade surpluses in Germany and anemic growth prospects almost everywhere else.
July's debt summit meeting was a more serious effort than past exercises in procrastination and denial. Leaders agreed to add funds to Europe's bailout agency and gave it new authority to aid vulnerable governments and banks. But they ducked too many issues and left too many blanks to be filled in. The bailout fund will not actually get the new money until later this year and cannot wield its new powers until all 17 euro-zone governments formally approve -- normally a lengthy, uncertain process.
Investors and creditors rightly concluded that there is still no European commitment or institution standing between Europe's troubled economies and default. Republican debt-ceiling antics in the United States further undermined investor confidence in Europe, driving home the sad truth that even countries with strong credit ratings can be driven toward default by shortsighted politicians.
Europe's leaders must get back to work and finish what they started in July. They must also persuade the European Central Bank to serve as Europe's unflinching lender of last resort until the bailout fund can take over.
With luck, those steps can buy enough time to put lasting solutions in place. Those must include a substantial write-down of Greece's existing debt and new fiscal strategies for Greece and other weakened economies emphasizing growth. Austerity isn't working for these countries, bringing only high unemployment, stagnating growth and deeper indebtedness. And it is not working for countries that embraced it voluntarily, like Britain.
This week's market upheavals should send a resounding message to politicians on both sides of the Atlantic that shortchanging growth and games of fiscal roulette are a recipe for years of stagnation and needless pain.

HEADLINE: Terms of Loan From Baseball Ease Dodgers' Fear of Seizure

BYLINE: By RICHARD SANDOMIR

 BODY:
Under the terms of a $150 million loan agreement submitted to federal bankruptcy court on Friday, Major League Baseball cannot seize control of the Los Angeles Dodgers if the team defaults. 
''The worst that can happen -- in the narrow case of default -- is they can stop funding,'' said Bruce Bennett, one of the Dodgers' lawyers. ''It is not a secured loan, so baseball can't foreclose on anything.''
Bennett said that the team's current cash needs were not dire and that it did not immediately need to ask for any of the $150 million. ''They have more than adequate resources to meet all their payables as they come due,'' he said, adding, ''We don't need to borrow the maximum amount of the loan.''
If Judge Kevin Gross of the bankruptcy court signs the order approving the loan, tensions between the team and M.L.B. should abate. In court filings, the Dodgers have accused Commissioner Bud Selig of forcing them into bankruptcy by rejecting loans and a TV deal with Fox Sports. Selig has accused Frank McCourt, the Dodgers' owner, of mismanagement.
McCourt contended that Selig's actions -- including hiring a monitor to oversee the team and sending investigators to examine its operations -- added up to a plan to seize the franchise and sell it.
At a hearing in bankruptcy court in Delaware last month, the Dodgers insisted they wanted to borrow $150 million from Highbridge Capital, a hedge fund, despite a higher interest rate than baseball offered and the risk of foreclosure in case of a default. Gross rejected the Highbridge loan and told M.L.B. and the Dodgers to negotiate a deal.
The loan agreement submitted to Gross removed the conditions that prompted Bennett to call it a ''deal with the devil.'' The short-term loan is due on Nov. 30, 2012.
Bennett has doubts about baseball's ability to finance the loan, but he said, ''We are satisfied that either they do have it or that Judge Gross will make sure they have it.''
Bennett would not discuss what was expected to be the Dodgers' next step: filing court documents designed to set up a process to sell their future TV rights. The estimated $2 billion to $3 billion deal with Fox Sports -- which would have given McCourt $385 million up front -- was rejected by Selig in June.

HEADLINE: Poll Shows Negative View of Tea Party Is on the Rise

BYLINE: By KATE ZERNIKE

 BODY:
Little more than a year ago, most Americans did not know enough about the Tea Party to have an opinion. Now, more people have opinions, and they are hardly positive.
The percentage of people with an unfavorable view of the Tea Party in a New York Times/CBS News Poll this week was higher than it has been since the first time the question was asked, in April 2010. Forty percent of those polled this week characterized their view as ''not favorable,'' compared with 18 percent in the first poll.
In the first poll, a plurality, 46 percent, said they had not heard enough about the Tea Party to have an opinion (an additional 14 percent were undecided). Now, just 21 percent said they had not heard enough. 
The Tea Party may have benefited early on from people not really knowing exactly what it was.
While 18 percent of people in the April 2010 poll identified themselves as Tea Party supporters, just 4 percent of those polled had actually attended a meeting or given money to the movement.
Without any central organization or policy platforms, the Tea Party became a vehicle for all sorts of amorphous frustrations. Many people came to it more out of anxiety about the economy or anger toward Washington than for any specific policy position.
On Election Day, while 4 in 10 voters said they were Tea Party supporters, many might not have known what they were signing up for.
The debate over the debt ceiling gave people a more concrete picture: Tea Party groups and members of the Tea Party caucus in the House and Senate -- many of them elected in the Republican sweep of 2010 -- insisted that they would not raise the debt ceiling under any circumstances. Members of the American public, meanwhile, including Tea Party supporters, were telling pollsters that they wanted compromise, not inflexibility.
Tea Party groups and lawmakers made debt reduction their priority, but many Americans said creating jobs was more important. And while many Republicans, influenced by the Tea Party, insisted that they would not allow any increases in tax revenue, a majority of Americans said debt reduction had to include higher taxes as well as lower spending.
Matt Kibbe, the president of FreedomWorks, the libertarian advocacy group that has encouraged the growth of the Tea Party movement, said he was not surprised that the negative views had grown, and blamed that change on attacks from Democrats during the debt-ceiling debate.
''It's almost a mantra with Democrats,'' he said, '' 'Call them Tea Party extremists.' It's the inevitable price you pay for having an impact.''
He said that the issues that Tea Party groups had been pushing -- balancing the budget, reducing the debt and cutting the size of government -- continued to be popular. ''These issues still animate a lot of independents and a growing number of Democrats with buyers' remorse,'' he said.
Jenny Beth Martin, a co-founder of Tea Party Patriots, a national umbrella of Tea Party groups, said people might be upset with the Tea Party because it was ''holding Republicans accountable and not just Democrats.''
''That bothers some people who tend to support Republicans just because they have an 'R' after their name,'' Ms. Martin said.
She said she had also seen an increase in her hate mail. But she still believes the Tea Party movement is winning. ''Part of the reason is that we're being effective, and we're demanding change,'' she said. ''And sometimes change scares people.''
Last year, many people were attracted to the Tea Party because they were angry at the way Congress, then led by Democrats, had handled negotiations over health care legislation, and saw it as Washington politics at its worst.
In the most recent poll, most Americans took a negative view of the debt-ceiling negotiations, seeing them as ''mostly about gaining political advantage.'' With Republicans in charge of the House, more of the blame fell on them. And many people -- a 43 percent plurality -- saw the Tea Party as having too much influence on Republicans.
Perhaps not surprisingly, Democrats were most likely to have an unfavorable view of the Tea Party. But a plurality of independents, too -- 40 percent -- viewed the Tea Party negatively, and said it had too much influence on the Republican Party.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Fairer Share of Tax Burden

 BODY:
To the Editor:
When the special Congressional committee begins its work to further reduce America's debt (''Debt Bill Signed, Ending Crisis and Fractious Battle,'' front page, Aug. 3), let's hope it looks at ways to rebalance the tax burden. 
After World War II, the United States debt was even larger, as a percent of gross domestic product, than the debt we face today. It was repaid largely from revenue from income taxes, with individuals paying just a slightly larger share than corporations in the 1940s.
Changes to the tax code in subsequent decades dramatically shifted that balance, so that individuals paid a much larger share of taxes, while the business contribution shrank. Individuals now pay almost five time more taxes than corporations. In 2010, individual taxpayers paid $898.5 billion in income taxes and companies paid $191.4 billion.
It's time for the pendulum to swing the other way, with America's families paying less and businesses picking up a larger fair share of the burden.

HEADLINE: Steep Increases Proposed for PATH Fares and Tolls at Hudson Crossings

BYLINE: By MICHAEL M. GRYNBAUM; Michael Barbaro contributed reporting.

 BODY:
The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey proposed its steepest toll increase in modern memory on Friday, unveiling a plan that would raise the cost of crossing the tunnels and bridges that span the Hudson River by 50 percent for most drivers and raise the price of a monthly PATH train pass by 65 percent.
E-ZPass users would see a jump from $8 to $12 at peak hours on the three major Hudson River crossings -- the George Washington Bridge and the Holland and Lincoln Tunnels -- as well as three other bridges between New Jersey and Staten Island. Drivers who pay with cash would be charged $7 more, or $15 a trip, making the toll one of the highest in the country. 
The provenance of the larger-than-expected proposed increases was mysterious. The two men who control the agency, Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey and Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo of New York, issued a statement saying they shared ''obvious and significant concerns'' about the proposal.
But privately, the Cuomo administration signed off on the plan within the past week, according to two sources familiar with internal discussions who spoke on the condition of anonymity to avoid angering administration officials. The agency had been planning for months to impose a $2 toll increase. The $4 proposal caught agency officials off guard.
Asked whether Governor Cuomo had pushed for the $4 increase, a spokesman, Josh Vlasto, responded, ''That's not true.'' But he would not elaborate on the discussions or the governor's view of the proposal.
''There is nothing more to say,'' Mr. Vlasto said.
Of course, governors often like to step in and halt unpopular increases and fees, and proposals to raise Port Authority tolls tend to start a familiar political dance: the agency puts forward a bracing plan, the public reacts angrily, and governors relish the role of advocate for the overburdened commuter. Usually, a more reasonable compromise is reached.
A public hearing on the proposal is expected to be held on Aug. 16, and the Port Authority's board of commissioners will consider the new tolls and fares at a meeting this month.
If the board votes for the plan, both governors would have 10 days during which they could veto the increases.
The board and the Port Authority's top administrative staff members are entirely selected by the two governors, and few decisions at the agency, which controls many of the region's bridges, tunnels, shipping ports and airports, are made without some form of consultation with Albany and Trenton.
The Port Authority, which receives all of its revenue through tolls and fees, has seen its budget wither from the poor economy, which has reduced the number of drivers on its crossings, and the siphoning off of funds for nonagency projects.
After Governor Christie decided last year to end an ambitious plan for another train tunnel under the Hudson because of its cost, he successfully pushed the agency to redistribute $1.8 billion of the money it had earmarked for the project instead to be used for road and highway repairs in New Jersey.
Some regional transportation advocates endorsed the toll increases on Friday, saying the additional revenue was sorely needed for major infrastructure projects. But critics said drivers and PATH riders would not be asked to make such large sacrifices if the agency's budget had not been raided.
''This increase is not surprising given the financial pressure'' put on the agency, said Kate Slevin, executive director of the Tri-State Transportation Campaign. And some New Jersey politicians said the big increases were a way for Mr. Christie, who has sworn off tax increases, to squeeze revenue from the commuting public.
''If you say you're not going to raise taxes on anybody to fund transportation, it's disingenuous to take money from the Port Authority and have them raise tolls, and act as if you're not responsible,'' said Assemblyman John S. Wisniewski, Democratic chairman of the State Assembly's transportation committee. The toll increase, he said, ''is Chris Christie's toll increase.''
Under the proposal, a single fare on the PATH train, the diminutive commuter subway system that connects parts of Manhattan to New Jersey, would be raised $1, to $2.75 a ride.
The price of a 30-day unlimited pass for the PATH system would be raised by 65 percent, to $89 from $54 a month.
The proposal calls for the crossing tolls to be raised again in 2014, with an increase of $2 for drivers. The PATH fare would not be raised again in 2014, under the current proposal.
Revenue from this year's increases would generate an additional $720 million for the agency. The second phase of increases, in 2014, would raise $290 million.

HEADLINE: Complaints to State of Illegal Rents Often Languish, Advocacy Group Says

BYLINE: By CARA BUCKLEY

 BODY:
Relations between Maria de los Santos and the landlord of her railroad apartment in Bushwick, Brooklyn, soured after she filed a complaint in 2007 over lack of heat. But they worsened, she said, after she discovered she had been overcharged in rent and appealed to the state housing agency for help.
Ms. de los Santos said the agency did not process her complaint for 18 months and, according to the agency, she has yet to be paid the $10,000 that the landlord owes her. All the while, she said, her landlord took advantage of the delay to harass her. 
''He came to the store,'' said Ms. de los Santos, who runs a flower shop, ''and he said, 'If you're still fighting for this, why don't you just leave?' ''
A tenant advocacy group says Ms. de los Santos's case is not unusual. In a survey of 200 rent-regulated apartments, the group, Make the Road New York, found that landlords for nearly half the units had registered rents above what they could legally charge. Yet because enforcement is largely complaint-driven, the state housing agency usually investigated rent increases only after tenants complained.
Processing the complaints, the advocacy group found, often took at least a year.
''It's not anything radical we're asking for,'' said Hilary Klein, a lead organizer at Make the Road New York, ''just that tenants' rights under the law be enforced.''
Landlords of rent-regulated apartments are required to report the legal rents for their units, as well as the actual amount they charge, to the housing agency, New York State Homes and Community Renewal.
Christopher Browne, deputy commissioner for policy and communications at Homes and Community Renewal, said Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo had recently overhauled rent laws.
''Enforcement is one of the things that is being strengthened,'' he said.
The agency is responsible for administering laws that govern 875,000 rent-regulated apartments statewide. Last year, 1,892 cases accusing landlords of overcharges were filed, and the agency found in favor of the tenants 670 times.
Roberta Bernstein, president of the Small Property Owners of New York, a landlord association, said that while rent overcharges did happen, landlords were often hamstrung by the legal rent that they could collect, which, she said, often did not cover maintenance or routine repairs.
''I'm not denying that it occurs, but in some cases, there could be legal reasons, valid reasons, for what's happening,'' Ms. Bernstein said. ''You have skewed situations where tenants are subsidized by the owner, and the owner attempts to balance the scales.''
She questioned the sources of the information in Make the Road New York's report (see also below), which is based on rent histories of 200 households, some of which came from rent histories collected by other community organizations.
Judith Goldiner, a supervising lawyer at the Legal Aid Society, said many tenants were unaware that their apartments were rent regulated, and often too intimidated to challenge their landlords.
After Ms. de los Santos, 32, discovered the overcharge - she was paying $1,080 and it was supposed to be, according to rent records, $927 - she began paying the lesser amount.
Her landlord, Manuel Gonzalez, paid her about $3,600 for the overcharges, but Ms. De los Santos said the check did not clear.
The state agency ruled this year that Mr. Gonzalez owed her a total of $10,000, less the $3,600. He has yet to pay, and Ms. de los Santos has appealed to the state agency for help.
Reached by phone, Mr. Gonzalez initially said he did not know that his check had been returned. But he then said he was having difficulties with his properties and was short of money.
''We're going to fix the problem with this,'' he said. ''We're going to pay and we got no money, O.K.?''
Before he could be asked about Ms. de los Santos's claim that he harassed her, he hung up.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Compounding Problems

BYLINE: By CARL RICHARDS

 BODY:
The showdown over increasing the federal debt limit got me thinking about the power of compound interest. It's always been one of the most powerful forces in the financial universe. And in the case of the debt ceiling, it appears that compound interest has the potential to become a crushing enemy. 
Some people fear that the United States will lose its AAA credit-rating or even default temporarily, potentially increasing how much it costs the government to borrow money. According to the Congressional Budget Office, ''...a 4-percentage-point across-the-board increase in interest rates would raise federal interest payments next year by about $100 billion; if those higher rates persisted, net interest costs in 2015 would be nearly double the roughly $460 billion that the C.B.O. currently projects for that year.''
Think about that for a minute. If those worst-case-scenario interest rates came to pass and persisted, we'd be approaching a trillion dollars in interest payments per year. That's what compound interest looks like when it's working against you.
On a personal scale, you get a taste of it every month if you get careless with credit cards. Take a look at a bill. For every month you carry a balance, there's a minimum payment required.
Many people only pay the minimum, not realizing that compound interest could make that $3,000 television cost way more than that and take over a decade to pay off. And that assumes you don't add any additional charges to the balance.
New rules require that credit card companies include a section on each statement that shows just how long it will take to pay off the balance if you only make the minimum payment. Do yourself a favor and pay attention to the numbers. What you owe will only compound over time, and paying the minimum just digs the hole that much faster.
J. Reuben Clark, an undersecretary of state for President Coolidge, noted a long time ago that, interest on debt ''never sleeps nor sickens nor dies... Once in debt, interest is your companion every minute of the day and night; you cannot shun it or slip away from it; you cannot dismiss it; it yields neither to entreaties, demands, or orders; and whenever you get in its way or cross its course or fail to meet its demands, it crushes you.''
It also gets in the way of achieving our goals. Last week, one reader commented that having a zero balance on your credit card was almost as good as saving money. There is some truth to that because every dollar we spend on interest is one less dollar that can be saved for the future.
Now it becomes a question of how to make compound interest work for you instead of working against you.
Next week we'll talk about the power of compound interest and the end of a long period of savings. In the meantime, what have you done to protect yourself from getting crushed by interest?
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Prison Term For Crimes Against Cuba Is Upheld

BYLINE: By DAMIEN CAVE

 BODY:
MEXICO CITY -- Cuba's highest court on Friday upheld a 15-year prison sentence for Alan Gross, an American contractor charged with crimes against the Cuban state for distributing satellite telephone equipment to Jewish groups in Havana. 
The ruling leaves Mr. Gross, 62, without another opportunity for appeal. He has already spent a year and a half in a Cuban prison, bruising relations with the United States, which has requested his release. Mr. Gross's lawyers say his only hope now is clemency.
''While we are not surprised, we are extremely disappointed with today's ruling,'' said Peter J. Kahn, Mr. Gross's American lawyer. He added that Mr. Gross's family ''remains hopeful that there continues to be room for a diplomatic resolution.''
Analysts said a release from the Cuban courts was never likely, in part because Mr. Gross, a technology consultant from Maryland, has become caught up in a longstanding dispute between the highest levels of the American and Cuban governments.
He had been sent to Cuba as part of a semicovert United States Agency for International Development program that has been supported for years by conservative Cuban-American exiles, and thus hated by Cuban officials, who see such programs as an affront to sovereignty. Since he was detained in December 2009 after being caught trying to hand out satellite telephone equipment that provides access to the Internet -- which the Cuban government tightly controls -- he has been held up as an example by both sides.
Cuban authorities have focused less on what he did than on their contention that he was part of a well-financed American conspiracy to ''subvert Cuban constitutional order.'' Mr. Gross's supporters in turn have used his case to highlight Cuba's limits on freedom, as they did again on Friday.
''Mr. Gross's unjust sentence is the latest example of everything that is wrong with the Castro regime,'' said Senator Marco Rubio, Republican of Florida, whose parents are Cuban exiles. ''For every Alan Gross, there are many more Cubans being incarcerated, harassed and repressed for simply yearning to be free.''
Mr. Gross's lawyers have been more conciliatory -- emphasizing that he has lost 100 pounds in prison, by his own estimation, and that several of his close relatives are ill. Philip Peters, an analyst with the Lexington Institute, a research and policy group, said that if there was a silver lining in Friday's decision, it would be that it cleared the way for a high-level discussion about a release on humanitarian grounds.
''The real issue is political,'' Mr. Peters said, ''and needs to be addressed not in courts, but in diplomatic talks.''

HEADLINE: Down to the Wire

 BODY:
More than 150 years ago, this newspaper took an editorial position on the question of tightrope walkers at Niagara Falls. We were opposed.
In 1859, a French daredevil known as the Great Blondin had been wowing huge crowds by walking back and forth on a rope over the Niagara Gorge. Not just walking -- somersaulting, bicycling, pushing a wheelbarrow and frying eggs. Once he carried a guy on his shoulders. 
Our editors were appalled. ''A cheap circus,'' they called it. ''The brutal excitements of the Pagan arena.'' ''The senseless and wicked trifling with human life and human feelings'' by this ... this ... ''man-monkey.''
(The editors' outrage was stoked by a real disaster that year. A bridge crowded with people watching a Blondin copycat collapsed and more than a dozen people died. The editors heaped blame on M. Blondin, for setting a bad example, the bridge builders, for obvious reasons, and the unlucky dead, for tolerating ''outrageous spectacles.'')
Stunts like tightrope walks and barrel plunges were later banned at the falls, with fines of up to $10,000. But times change and now another audacious man, Nik Wallenda of the famous flying family, wants to walk in Blondin's footsteps, for reality TV. Mr. Wallenda is no outlaw; he has asked American and Canadian authorities for a waiver. The New York State Legislature and the City Council of Niagara Falls, N.Y., have given their blessing, eager to give people a reason, any reason, to go to Niagara Falls and spend money.
But Canada's Niagara Parks Commission is dubious. It was created, after all, to end the carnival atmosphere and lend decorum to a natural wonder. We'll leave it for others to decide if that mission is succeeding, perhaps after a game of glow-in-the-dark mini-golf.
On the economically dismal New York side, only a few have questioned the wisdom of cashing in on suicide-tinged stunting and gawking. ''Are we that desperate?'' a local historian asked the Niagara Falls City Council. The answer, sadly, was: Heck yeah.

HEADLINE: Wild Market Quiets Buzz For I.P.O.'s

BYLINE: By EVELYN M. RUSLI and MICHAEL J. DE LA MERCED

 BODY:
As stocks swing violently, a chill is beginning to settle on the initial public offering market.
A small number of companies have already retreated on their offering plans. WageWorks, an employee benefits provider, pushed its offering, originally scheduled for Friday, to next week and dropped its target price range by as much as 43 percent. Two real estate investment trusts, Orchid Island Capital and Eola Property Trust, have withdrawn their filings. And Old Mutual, a big South African insurance company, said on Friday that it was now unlikely to go public in the United States before the end of next year because of market conditions.
For volatility is the enemy of the I.P.O. market. The ripples could spread, affecting even larger offerings this year, including some hotly awaited Internet offerings, as well as the sales of government-owned shares in companies like the American International Group, General Motors and the lender Ally Financial. 
Ally may prove to be the most difficult, with the Treasury Department and its underwriters having postponed its initial public offering in June. The former G.M. financing arm may now seek to go public in September, though that is looking unlikely given the recent market swings, according to a person briefed on the matter.
Yet A.I.G.'s chief executive, Robert H. Benmosche, professed little worry about the current market conditions' effect on the insurer's next stock offering. ''We're going to make that decision in November,'' he said in an interview on Friday.
Still, when there are jitters in the market, offerings are vulnerable.
''Until volatility settles, we're not going to see a lot of I.P.O. launches,'' said Brian Reilly, head of United States equity capital markets at Barclays Capital, referring to the moment a company sets its price range and starts a road show to court investors.
One measure of market volatility, the Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index, or VIX - known as Wall Street's fear gauge - on Friday reached its highest level since May 2010. That degree of uncertainty makes it difficult for companies to price their offerings and for investors to feel confident that they can generate meaningful returns.
''The best advice for most clients is to wait for volatility to calm down,'' Mr. Reilly said.
The sharp jitters in the market threaten a broad range of deals on Wall Street, including acquisitions, which can be ultrasensitive to price fluctuations in the equity markets. But the current roller coaster may be particularly damaging to the offerings market, analysts say, which is still recovering from the financial crisis, when it was virtually moribund.
Although demand for offerings in the United States has been somewhat uneven, the market has shown signs of strength. So far this year, the number of offerings is up nearly 15 percent, to 93, while proceeds have more than doubled to $28.5 billion, according to data from Renaissance Capital, a firm that advises on stock offerings.
A lot of that growth can be traced to the technology sector, which has produced some of the most highly anticipated public offerings, like the online music service Pandora Media and LinkedIn, the social network for professionals. When LinkedIn went public in May, it raised more than $350 million and its shares surged 109 percent on their first day of trading.
LinkedIn's success was seen to be a curtain raiser to a string of even larger Internet blockbusters. The popular games maker Zynga and Groupon, a daily coupon Web site, have recently filed to go public. Facebook, the world's largest social network, is on track to file within the next eight months, at a valuation north of $100 billion, according to people close to the matter.
These popular start-ups, which have been heavily traded on secondary markets, were largely seen as immune to market turbulence because of the feverish demand for their shares. But a prolonged severe period of volatility could eventually drag down these companies too, analysts say, forcing management and bankers to revise timelines and trim valuations.
''You can't sit here with a high valuation, when everything else is crashing around you,'' said Kathleen Smith, a principal at Renaissance. ''Even Facebook may have a hard time getting its offering done at a premium.''
For now, the hope is that the economy calms down by September, when the stock offering market restarts in earnest after a traditionally slow August.
''Thank goodness it's August,'' said Horace Nash, a partner at Fenwick & West, a prestigious Silicon Valley law firm. ''In the medium term, it's pretty unpredictable, but it's not going to kill a filed transaction.''
Though Mr. Nash still believes the largest offerings exist in a silo apart from the rest of the technology sector, he says instability will most likely sway their valuations. ''That would really put the sand in the gears,'' he said.
David J. Abella, a portfolio manager with Rochdale Investment Management, says he is closely watching the markets and has already lowered his price expectations based on the broader market declines. He foresees a stark divide in the market, where offerings from well-known brands like Dunkin' Donuts and Zynga perform well, but the rest of the market struggles to find its footing.
''If I'm able to get an allocation from a top-tier name, I will generally be a buyer,'' he said. ''In this market, you might not get the same upside as LinkedIn, but it will probably still be attractive.''
Mr. Abella says his firm will not buy shares from top tier names on the first day of trading and will be especially wary of debt-laden, private-equity-backed offerings, which he predicts will suffer in this environment.
Investor confidence will be put to the test once again next week, with 12 companies expected to go public in the final push before the late-summer lull. WageWorks is back, along with Trustwave Holdings, an enterprise software company, and HomeStreet, a modest-sized regional bank. If all go public, it will be the best showing since 2007. But few expect next week to go without a hitch.
''Some may do better than expected, but it's gotten a lot riskier,'' Mr. Abella said.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: As Corporate Profits Rise, Workers' Income Declines

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS. 
Floyd Norris comments on finance and economics in his blog at norris.blogs.nytimes.com

 BODY:
THESE are the worst of times for workers, and the best of times for companies. At least that is one way to read the newly revised national economic statistics.
The Commerce Department last week reduced its estimates of economic growth in 2010 and early 2011. At the same time, it said corporate income was much better than it had thought. Using newly available data from 2009 corporate tax returns, the department raised its estimates of corporate profits by 8.3 percent for 2009 and 10.8 percent for 2010.
The new figures indicate that corporate profits accounted for 14 percent of the total national income in 2010, the highest proportion ever recorded. The previous peak, of 13.6 percent, was set in 1942 when the need for war materials filled the order books of companies at the same time as the government imposed wage and price controls, holding down the costs companies had to pay. 
In the first quarter of 2011, the latest figures available, the new estimates indicate corporate profits accounted for 14.2 percent of national income, well above the 13.1 percent that had previously been estimated.
The news is not so good for smaller enterprises. The government category for many such businesses, known as proprietors and partnerships, is based on the type of tax returns filed, and is not completely accurate because some large enterprises file partnership tax returns while some smaller ones file as corporations. But it is generally used as a proxy for small business.
The latest figures indicate the smaller businesses' share of national income fell to a 17-year low of 7.7 percent in 2009, but recovered to 8.3 percent in 2010 and in the first quarter of this year.
Employees have always received more than half the total national income, until now. In 2010, the percentage of national income devoted to wages and salaries fell to 49.9 percent, and it slipped a little more to 49.6 percent in the first quarter of this year. That continued decline may help explain the economic worries of many Americans who have jobs but still fear they are falling behind.
The figure for wages and salaries reflects only what employees are directly paid, and does not include the cost paid by employers for benefits, which has been steadily rising over the years. It is thus not an accurate gauge from the point of view of employers, for whom a dollar spent on health insurance premiums is no less real than one spent on wages.
Adding the two categories together may provide a better view of the share of national income going to workers or being spent for their benefit.
The 2010 total, of 62.1 percent, is not close to the record low share of 54.5 percent, set in 1929, the first year for which numbers are available. But it is the lowest for any full year since 1965. In the first quarter of 2011, it slipped further, to 61.7 percent.
National income, as calculated by the Commerce Department, is similar to gross domestic product but excludes some items, most notably an estimate of depreciation. Besides the ones shown in the charts, there are other categories included in national income, including rental income and net interest income, so the figures shown do not add up to 100 percent.
One way to look at recent trends is to compare the total income figures for 2010 with those of 2006, before the economy began to slide into recession. In nominal dollars, not adjusted for inflation, national income was 6.7 percent higher in 2010 -- a gain that did not come close to matching the 8.2 percent rise in the consumer price index.
Total employee compensation, including benefits, rose 6.6 percent, although wages and salaries gained only 5.6 percent. Corporate profits were 11.9 percent higher, while proprietors' income was down 8.5 percent. Corporate profits more than kept up with inflation. Other categories of income did not.
It can be misleading to look at shares of income without examining their magnitude. A small share of a big pie may be larger than a big share of a small pie. The record high share for wages and salaries, of 59.7 percent, came in 1932. Worker pay was plunging in those days, but not as fast as corporate profits. Companies as a group lost money that year.
Nonetheless, President John F. Kennedy's observation that a rising tide lifts all boats is no longer as true as it once was.
There have been 10 years when corporate profits as a share of national income exceeded 13 percent -- 1941, '42, '43, '50, '51, '55, '65, '66, 2006 and 2010. In eight of those years, the economy, as measured by real gross national product, grew at a rate of greater than 6 percent.
The exceptions were 2006, when real growth was just 2.7 percent, and 2010, when it was 3 percent.
Similarly, in the past, unemployment was generally low when corporate profits were high. In 2006, the unemployment rate ended the year at 4.4 percent -- and that was higher than it had been in other postwar years when the corporate share of national income was high. At the end of 2010, the jobless rate was 9.4 percent. On Friday, the government reported that the rate was 9.1 percent in July.

GRAPHIC: CHARTS: Each category's share of national income after last week's revisions by the Commerce Department: Corporate profits were much stronger in 2009 and 2010 than the government had thought, and rose to a record share of national income. But profits were not as strong for smaller businesses. Wage and salary income fell to a record low relative to total national income. The cost of employee benefits was a little lower than had been estimated, but remained near record levels. (Source: Bureau of Economic Analysis, via Haver Analytics)

HEADLINE: Managing an Investment Portfolio for Risks, Not Only Returns

BYLINE: By PAUL SULLIVAN

 BODY:
LIKE many Americans, I watched the debate in Washington over the debt ceiling in utter disbelief that lawmakers would risk the sterling credit rating of the United States over something that had been raised 10 times since 2001.
The debt debate fell into the category of events that could hurt your portfolio, with you having little control over it. The same goes for the drop in stock prices at the end of the week; even if you did everything right with your own finances, your portfolio still could lose value.
Yet there are many risks in people's investments that they can control. How many investors, for instance, know what is in their portfolios and, more important, how those assets work -- or do not work -- together? How many people use several financial advisers who do not know what the other managers are doing? These and other common mistakes can expose a portfolio to unintended risks.
''This is a primary issue for individual investors,'' said Stephen M. Horan, head of private wealth management at the CFA Institute, an association of investment professionals. ''We have a much clearer sense of what return is than what risk is. But losses govern the accumulation of wealth to a dramatic extent.'' 
Here are three areas of risk that often get overlooked:
SECURITY SELECTION The classic example of unintended risk in a portfolio is the investor who buys six different mutual funds and thinks that equals diversification. What the investor may not realize is that all six funds can own 10 of the same stocks. Instead of diversifying risk, the investor has concentrated it.
Mr. Horan said investors needed to know what their holdings actually were. It is easy. Look up the funds' Top 10 holdings, available on the fund's Web site, and the sector concentrations. Then, investors need to have the courage of their convictions. Lynn Ballou, an investment adviser and also an ambassador for the Certified Financial Planner Board of Standards, said investors inadvertently increased their risk by being swayed by people who had little knowledge of their portfolio.
''It's, 'I went out to lunch with someone and he said, wink, wink, nod, nod, I've heard about this company and I'm going to buy some and you should, too,' '' Ms. Ballou said. ''All that is what I call sexy noise. And 99 times out of 100, it's just fun lunch talk.''
But should investors act on those tips, they risk a problem that Chris Walters, executive vice president at Citizens Trust , calls ''portfolio happens,'' the accumulation of investments that are not part of an overarching strategy and do not work together.
At the extreme, he said, was a client who recently bought $1 million of gold bullion without telling anyone. ''We said, 'How are you going to get it home? What are you going to do with it?' '' Mr. Walters said. But the best advice is to have a personal benchmark, pegged to when you will need the money, like in retirement. Thomas J. Pauloski, national managing director in the wealth management group at AllianceBernstein, said he urged his clients to do that.
''You want to get people away from focusing on the day-to-day jousting,'' he said. In doing this, an investor hopes to reduce the risk of buying high and selling low.
MANAGING SECURITIES The market crash of 2008 has instilled a fear of being overly concentrated with any one manager or firm. But spreading out everything among different people is not the solution, either.
''We think about the best fund managers and do a pretty good job at the beginning of finding them,'' Ms. Ballou said. ''But we don't stay on top of them. And then, it's, 'I just read my famous fund manager retired or got indicted -- what do I do now?' ''
She said more people should think about who is managing their portfolios the way they would think about a garden: after spending time planting beautiful flowers, they don't let it go without pruning and weeding.
This discipline is not easy, even among the wealthiest. One investor, whose family's wealth came from an agricultural products company and inheritance, said it was not until the family decided to move to another financial firm that they found out how much unintended risk was in their portfolio.
The investor, who asked not to be name to protect his family's privacy, said the family had 5 percent of its $50 million of liquid wealth in Microsoft and 7 to 8 percent in Oracle. But since the stocks were held in various accounts, they did not realize how concentrated they were.
''We looked at the stock statements and not what was in the funds,'' he said. ''Microsoft and Oracle are great companies, but we didn't have any other significant holdings.''
BNY Mellon Wealth Management performed the risk audit on the portfolio and the family moved their money to that firm. But Timothy E. Sheehan, senior director for business development at the firm, said the risk audits he did for clients were something anyone could do.
''All of this is public information,'' he said. ''But when you tell them they own 30,000 different equity shares, they say, 'How did that happen?' ''
A better way for investors to think about risk in their portfolio may be to consider various situations, Mr. Horan said. One might be looking at how your portfolio would fare with high inflation. (Answer: Banks perform less well than companies with tangible assets, like automakers and airlines.)
HIGH-END RISKS Sophisticated, often customized investments have become the norm for those at the top of the wealth scale to minimize losses or maximize returns.
Beyond the obvious risk that an investment will not pan out, there are other risks as well. One is being blinded by the name of an investment and not considering what it does with your money.
Mr. Walters pointed out that people often talked about being invested in hedge funds as if that alone meant something. A hedge fund, like a mutual fund, is just a vehicle to buy and sell things. Investors who don't understand the fund's strategy could unintentionally increase their risk, just like buying six different mutual funds.
Likewise, a private equity fund can give investors a sense of stability that may not be real. It comes partly from how infrequently it is valued. ''If it was priced daily, it would look more like a microcap fund,'' which is more volatile, Mr. Walters said.
Then there are investors who think they are doing the right thing by spreading their money across different asset classes without understanding that those assets perform the same way. Mr. Walters said many of his clients in California own real estate along with municipal bonds. But both assets are vulnerable to interest rates and go up and down together.
Having a point person to gather all the information could help reduce these unintended risks, but who should that be? Advisers will vie for that role, but winning is not easy.
''Upfront, clients are very reluctant and they don't want to show their hand,'' said Nancy Driggers, senior portfolio manager at BNY Mellon Wealth Management in Atlanta. ''A lot of times, they've never seen everything in one place. They think of it as very compartmentalized.''
That may be fine for some investors who are their own point people. Spreading out their money protects them from the risks of a single firm or adviser.
But they also could find themselves overly concentrated in one area, not invested in another or lacking an overall plan. Unlike Congressional infighting, that is something individual investors can control.

HEADLINE: Crises Reach Across Borders: Resisting the Urge to Run Away From Home

BYLINE: By RON LIEBER

 BODY:
In market moments like these, it's always tempting do something really big and bold with our investments.
Here's a bad idea that's likely to occur to the fight-or-flight animal within all of us: Scale way back on stocks in parts of the developed world with economic woes and put the proceeds someplace far, far away, in emerging-markets stocks or gold or foreign currencies.
It's clear why this is tempting. After all, there are too few grown-ups at all levels of government who are willing to both scale back programs and raise the taxes we need to pay for them. Standard & Poor's, in fact, expressed its own disillusionment on Friday night by taking the long-term sovereign credit rating of the United States down a notch.
Meanwhile, in Europe, it seems that with each passing week another country is at risk of not being able to make good on its debt. 
If you've lived through these swoons before, however, you know that few knee-jerk investing strategies born of uncertain times prove to be anything but total bunk. But this particular bit of lunacy is useful for the question it raises about the optimal amount of money to bet on your own country. The answer: leave more at home than your animal instincts would suggest right now.
Let's start with a few givens. First of all, no parking money on the sidelines. You will read a lot about ''investors'' going to cash, but they are among a couple kinds of people.
There are professionals, who aren't investing for the long run. Then, there are individuals who don't realize that most investors who bail out end up selling at low prices and getting back in again after prices have spiked.
Most of us should be the third kind of investor, the one who rebalances by selling the winners in well-balanced portfolios and buying the losers after large percentage declines.
The second given is this: we believe in stocks. For those of us who have a time horizon longer than a decade or two and lack a trust fund or a fat pension, a portfolio made of anything other than a hefty proportion of stocks stands a good chance of not earning enough over time. Low returns necessitate unpleasantries like doubling savings, working much longer or living on less in retirement.
And a third given: we're talking about index or other passively managed mutual or exchange-traded funds here. Tracking individual stocks requires too much work and adds too much risk of underperforming the various market indexes.
As for whether you should run scared from your investments in the United States and Europe, the most natural initial question is this: Why bother investing outside of these regions when global markets seem to move in tandem?
There are three reasons. While it is true that global markets move up and down together with more similarity than they used to, returns are not identical either. As a result, owning stocks around the world should decrease your overall volatility, which can help returns.
Second, there's currency diversification, which helps at times like these when the American dollar is weak. And finally, there is industry diversification in things like manufacturing, which you don't get as much of from some developed-market companies as you used to.
While our hair-trigger strategy from up above suggests that familiarity with the United States and much of Europe ought to breed contempt with their stocks now, the reverse has historically been true. Investors exhibit ''home bias,'' owning a collection of stocks from their own country that is out of proportion to that country's ranking in the global market.
In the United States, this results partly from our smug feeling of singularity in general. But it may also be a comfort thing.
''They know Wal-Mart, but when you show them Petrobas or a company with another funny sounding name, there is some uncertainty,'' said Mike Palmer, a principal with the Trust Company of the South in Raleigh, N.C. ''People like certainty in their investment portfolios. But we don't know where the next Wal-Mart is.''
In fact, American investors exhibit the least amount of home bias on earth according to academic research by three professors, Sie Ting Lau, Lilian Ng and Bohui Zhang. (The homebody awards go to investors in the Czech Republic and Peru.)
Still, the professionals in the United States who move the most money around tend not to match the market exactly.
The value of American stocks makes up roughly 40 percent of the world's stock market, but you won't find many target date mutual funds with 60 percent of their stocks in international investments.
Fidelity increased the international portion of its stock collection to just 30 percent in 2009. Vanguard followed suit in 2010. Even Dimensional Fund Advisors, a company built on academic research about the efficiency of markets, has just 40 percent or so of its stock money in international securities in its mutual funds that allocate assets for investors.
Why not match the 60 percent allocation that truly represents international stocks' share of all stocks on earth?
Vanguard notes that the higher expenses of investing outside the United States can affect returns. Dimensional points to taxes -- some countries withhold them and that can reduce returns for many American investors.
Rick Ferri, author of ''All About Asset Allocation'' and founder of the money management firm Portfolio Solutions, has had his clients' international stock allocations fixed at 30 percent for 12 years.
He notes that given all of the business that American companies do outside the country, anything more than 30 percent may not reward you with the returns you would want as compensation for the fact that many emerging-markets stocks bounce around more than others.
That said, emerging-markets stocks have returned a bit more than others historically in exchange for their wild swings. So wouldn't now be a good time to make a big bet on their stocks? Or certainly their currencies, since the dollar may remain weak?
''If you're certain that the dollar has to go down from here, the market is going to be aware of it and account for all of those beliefs already,'' said Chris Philips who works in Vanguard's investment strategy group. ''You're going up against hedge funds and professional traders.''
And even if you have a bright idea before they do, betting on countries is tricky. Consider a Dimensional Funds commentary that's been making the rounds among the rational recently. (I've linked to it from here in the online version of the column.)
The article notes that ratings agencies ranked Indonesia's sovereign debt in the junk category for all of the last decade, though it has improved some. Despite the supposed uncertainty, however, its stock market's total return has been 33 percent a year in dollars.
There are probably not a lot of people who made big stock bets in Jakarta, though. There are even fewer, if any, anywhere on the planet, who found all the Indonesias and can pick them again in the future.
And that's why humble investors spread their bets around the globe, avoiding both home bias and the kind of home-country self-hatred that times like these can too easily breed.

HEADLINE: America's economic crisis has clear political roots

 BODY:
By nearly every recent measure -- growth, consumer spending, manufacturing, house prices and stock prices -- the American economy is struggling. The jobs report for July, released on Friday, was a bit better than expected, but still grim. 
The question now is whether Washington will move beyond the wrongheaded focus on budget cuts -- the last thing a faltering economy needs -- to job creation.
With the debt limit fight over for now, President Obama has ratcheted up the talk about jobs. That is a start, but only a start. What the economy needs is real government investment to support demand and create new jobs.
The handicappers will tell you that that is impossible given Congressional Republicans' fierce opposition to any new spending or new revenues. The alternative is months, and even years, of stagnation or worse.
The numbers are undeniable. The economy created 117,000 jobs in July, but at comparable points in the recoveries from other severe recessions, the economy was adding about 400,000 jobs a month.
Even at that rate, it would be three years before the unemployment rate was down to its prerecession level of 5 percent. In the last three months, job growth has averaged 72,000.
The downtick in the unemployment rate, to 9.1 percent from 9.2 percent, is also dismaying on closer inspection. It does not reflect an increase in the share of workers finding jobs. Rather, it reflects a shrinking labor force, as the long-term unemployed and other jobless workers give up looking for jobs. If nearly three million sidelined workers were included in the official unemployment rate, it would be 10.7 percent. (The rate is higher still, 16.1 percent, when people who can only find part-time jobs are included.)
Washington may be in denial, but the rest of the country knows what's going on. A New York Times/CBS News Poll, released the same day as the July jobs report, showed that by a ratio of more than two to one, Americans say that creating jobs should be a higher priority than cutting spending.
The poll also showed that a record 82 percent of Americans now say they disapprove of Congress, a sentiment that is surely fed by the belief of an overwhelming majority who told the pollsters that the debt ceiling fight was more about gaining political advantage than doing what is best for the country.
President Obama must push Congress to extend federal unemployment benefits and the payroll tax cut for employees before they expire at year's end. Congress should also establish an infrastructure bank to finance building projects and initiate a direct federal job creation program to employ young people in their communities.
The American people understand what's needed, even if Congress doesn't. As Stanley Oland, 62, a Republican from Kalispell, Mont., told the pollsters: ''Unless you have working people, you don't have revenue from taxes. If you cut spending, jobs will be eliminated and you won't get any revenue. Every dollar spent creates jobs.''
Is anyone listening?

HEADLINE: The Tea Party, Take Two

BYLINE: By JOE NOCERA

 BODY:
In the four months since I began writing an Op-Ed column, the thing that has most surprised me is how darned liberal I sound sometimes. I know that seems like a strange thing to say, so let me explain.
Growing up in heavily Democratic Providence, R.I., in the 1950s, it was hard not to absorb the values of the Democratic Party -- the party of Roosevelt, as my parents often reminded me, who had gotten the country through the Great Depression. My parents and their friends believed in a progressive income tax, in the importance of unions (my parents were public schoolteachers), and in a government that helped those who couldn't help themselves. It wasn't until I moved to Washington after college that I got to know any Republicans. Not until I was nearing 30, and living in Texas, did I see how conservative most of the country truly is. 
Early in my career as a journalist, I had a mentor, Charlie Peters, who believed strongly that it was important for liberals to criticize various wrongheaded tenets of liberalism. He used his magazine, The Washington Monthly -- and his young editors, of which I was one -- to do so regularly. I remember once writing an article so critical of teachers' unions that my mother was moved to complain in a letter to the editor.
In Texas, where I started writing about business, my views evolved further. Businessmen were not the embodiment of evil, as liberals sometimes seemed to think. Some regulations made sense, but others did not. And so on. I came to see myself as a pragmatist who favored common-sense solutions over ideology.
Then came the financial crisis. I like to joke that there's nothing like a good financial crisis to turn you into a liberal. But it's not really a joke. The more I learned the back story that led to the crisis, the more horrified I became. The lack of regulation and oversight of Wall Street and the big subprime companies like Countrywide, driven by the ideology of deregulation, was thoughtless and irresponsible. The refusal of bank regulators to stop subprime abuses bordered on the criminally negligent. The unwillingness of the Obama Justice Department, even now, to hold anyone to account for their role in the crisis has been disheartening.
Once the Republicans gained control of the House of Representatives, they began to systemically undermine the Dodd-Frank reform law, pushing back against new, and mostly sensible, regulations designed to prevent another meltdown. The worst was the way Republicans took a hatchet to Elizabeth Warren as she tried to set up the new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Such an agency, had it been in existence prior to 2008, might have prevented millions of Americans, many of them poor and financially unsophisticated, from being gouged by mortgage companies. Watching it all unfold made me angry.
That anger reached its apex on Tuesday, when I wrote a column comparing the Tea Party Republicans to terrorists. The words I chose were intemperate and offensive to many, and I've been roundly criticized. I was a hypocrite, the critics said, for using such language when on other occasions I've called for a more civil politics. In the cool light of day, I agree with them. I apologize.
I still think it was terribly wrong for the Republicans to use the threat of default to insist on massive spending cuts, though President Obama also deserves blame for playing his hand so poorly. Putting on my pragmatist hat again, I also think Congress could not have chosen a worse time to rein in spending. Yes, the country's enormous debt -- and the entitlement programs that are driving the federal deficit -- needs to be brought under control.
But look at how sick the economy is. Standard and Poor's just downgraded U.S. debt for the first time in modern history. Despite the better-than-expected job numbers on Friday, unemployment remains stubbornly, and unacceptably, high. So far this year, G.D.P. growth is under 1 percent. The stock market is skittish. Companies have cash, but they aren't hiring because there is no demand for their products.
Choking off spending can only make matters worse. Mark Zandi, the well-known economist at Moody's Analytics -- who applauds the debt ceiling deal -- acknowledged to me that if major spending cuts take place in 2013, as is currently envisioned, they will cost the country 1.5 percent of G.D.P. The debt ceiling deal, it seems to me, practically guarantees another recession.
Most frightening of all, the hand-to-hand combat over spending is going to resume shortly when Congress returns from the August recess, and its supercommittee will start to look for an additional $1.5 trillion in cuts. It is hard to see how the outcome of those negotiations will be any different from this last awful go-round. In all likelihood, they will inflict more damage to our battered economy.
Undoubtedly, I'll write columns about those negotiations. But I won't be calling anybody names. That I can promise.

9 P.M. (Starz) HOW DO YOU KNOW (2010) Reese Witherspoon taps into her intimidating side to play Lisa, a 31-year-old softball star whose world-class aspirations have been dealt a huge blow. Owen Wilson, above with Ms. Witherspoon, is Matty, the major-league pitcher whose spell she falls under, and who thinks he may be ready to give commitment a try. Then George (Paul Rudd) enters Lisa's life, first as a dud of a blind date and then as a friend whose father-cum-boss, Charles (Jack Nicholson), isn't all that unhappy about letting his son take the fall for his own financial misdeeds. Now Lisa needs to decide. Writing in The New York Times, Manohla Dargis said that this romantic comedy from James L. Brooks was ''so wan and disconnected to anything that feels like real life or, just as good, a screwball interpretation of it, that it's hard to know what Mr. Brooks was really after, other than passing the time with some talented movie people.'' Curiously, she added, Ms. Witherspoon, Mr. Rudd and Mr. Wilson were ''outshone by a pair of character actors -- Kathryn Hahn, who plays George's secretary, Annie, and Lenny Venito, as her boyfriend -- who, in an overworked, overwritten hospital scene, show you what love looks like simply by, surprise, good acting.'' 
6 A.M. (TCM) SUMMER UNDER THE STARS: LUCILLE BALL An all-day tribute to Ball, the glamorous blond Goldwyn showgirl turned carrot-top comedian, begins with ''Du Barry Was a Lady'' (1943), Roy Del Ruth's musical about Louis Blore (Red Skelton), a nightclub coatroom attendant who dreams that he's Louis XV and that the star he idolizes, May Daly (Ball) -- who claims to be interested only in rich men -- is his lover. Gene Kelly plays the club M.C., Alec Howe, Louis's rival for May's affections. In ''The Long, Long Trailer'' (1954), at 2:30 p.m., Ball and her real-life husband, Desi Arnaz, above, portray newlyweds who take to the road in an oversize motor home. And in ''Stage Door'' (1937), at 8, Ball is a New York City actress, alongside Ginger Rogers, Eve Arden and Ann Miller, in a boarding house where a society beauty (Katharine Hepburn) has come to fulfill her Broadway dreams.
10 A.M. (Fox News Channel) ON THE BRINK: ANSWERS FROM THE ABYSS In a special live edition of ''The Cost of Freedom,'' Neil Cavuto looks at the recent market sell-off and speaks to political and business leaders about the impact of the legislative deal earlier this week to raise the country's debt ceiling, and what needs to be done to improve the economy and the job market.
NOON (OWN) THE SWELL LIFE Nine back-to-back episodes follow a summer with Izzy Paskowitz, a world-class surfer, and his wife, Danielle, a former model, as they rear three children and run Surfer's Healing, a camp for children with autism inspired by their 18-year-old son, Isaiah.
7:30 P.M. (HGTV) CANDICE TELLS ALL New episodes of this channel's prime-time design-theme shows kick off with Candice Olson's transformation of a lakeside home's walkout basement into a mudroom, family room and satellite kitchen to handle holiday overflow and summer barbecues. The evening ends with ''Home by Novogratz,'' at 10, in which Cortney and Robert Novogratz take their seven children to Florida, where the parents upgrade a music room and create art and reading spaces at the Winegard Elementary School in Orlando.
8 P.M. (NBC) WHO IS SIMON MILLER? (2011) This latest entry in NBC's ''Family Movie Night'' chronicles the exploits of the Millers: the patriarch, Simon (Loren Dean), whose frequent business trips have created an emotional distance between him and his family; his wife, Meredith (Robyn Lively); their daughter, Sarah (Skyler Day), an 18-year-old honor student who has landed in hot water at school; and their son, Kevin (Drew Koles), whose interests begin and end with video games. Then Simon vanishes, leaving behind a stash of passports with various aliases and a frantic phone message instructing his family not to tell anyone that he has disappeared. Now the Millers have a mission: to return the dad they thought they knew to safety, whatever it takes.
9 P.M. (BBC America) OUTCASTS The season ends as a deadly virus hits Forthaven, causing President Tate (Liam Cunningham) and Stella (Hermione Norris) to worry that it's an answer to their attempts at communication with the host force. Berger (Eric Mabius), on the other hand, blames the genetically modified humans known as ACs and, after revealing a shocking secret about Fleur (Amy Manson), sets out to bring down Tate's government and create a new order. In ''The Graham Norton Show,'' at 10, Mr. Norton chats with Liza Minnelli and James McAvoy. KATHRYN SHATTUCK

HEADLINE: Crises Reach Across Borders: Italy Vows to Contain Debt Crisis As G-7 Hastily Organizes a Meeting

BYLINE: By LIZ ALDERMAN; Judy Dempsey contributed reporting from Berlin, James Kanter from Brussels and Matthew Saltmarsh from London.

 BODY:
PARIS -- As European leaders on Friday tried to calm fears that the region's sovereign debt problems were spinning beyond politicians' control, Italy's prime minister said finance ministers from the Group of 7 industrial nations would meet ''within days'' to discuss the volatile financial crisis.
The Italian prime minister, Silvio Berlusconi, whose nation has been viewed as the next potential debt-laden domino to fall, also announced a number of measures Italy would take to restore the confidence of investors and creditors.
The G-7 meeting is meant to show that leaders are taking action to address the crisis, even before votes occur in national parliaments next month to expand Europe's rescue fund for its most financially troubled members. 
While no details of the meeting's agenda were given, the situation ''requires coordinated action,'' Mr. Berlusconi said. ''We have to recognize that the world has entered a global financial crisis that concerns all countries.''
For all the hum of activity on Friday, though, many economists and analysts remained unconvinced that sufficient steps were being taken to resolve the problems engulfing the European nations that share the euro.
European stocks were down for a second consecutive day on Friday, on the gnawing realization that Europe and the United States may face fundamental economic problems for years to come.
The turmoil prompted a flurry of phone calls between President Nicolas Sarkozy of France from his vacation retreat on the French Riviera, and Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, who had chosen an August getaway to Italy. Mrs. Merkel and Mr. Sarkozy also each spoke with President Obama on Friday, the White House said, but offered no details on their discussions.
Mr. Berlusconi, meanwhile, spoke by phone Friday with Mrs. Merkel and, separately, with Herman Van Rompuy, the European Council president, and with Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero of Spain -- the other big debt-saddled European country that, like Italy, is seen as teetering.
Mr. Zapatero of Spain, whose economy is in greater peril as investors drive up borrowing costs, also spoke separately to both Mr. Sarkozy and Mrs. Merkel from his vacation in Andalucia.
At a hastily called news conference, Mr. Berlusconi, who has been criticized for being too slow to recognize that Italy's debt problems threaten the euro union, said his country would take various steps to address the crisis.
He said Italy would aim for a balanced budget a year earlier than a previously stated 2013 deadline, seek a constitutional balanced-budget amendment and make other moves to liberalize the nation's economy -- which is so sclerotic from bureaucratic rules that it has barely grown for a decade.
Parliament may shorten its August recess to pass the measures, Mr. Berlusconi said. He appeared alongside the economy minister, Giulio Tremonti, whom Mr. Berlusconi had recently treated with public disdain that added to the market's concerns about Italy.
Many analysts remain skeptical that European leaders have grasped the problems confronting them.
''Politicians have done everything to demonstrate they are not ahead of the curve,'' said Stefan Schneider, the chief international economist at Deutsche Bank in Frankfurt. ''That is hitting market confidence and creating a self-fulfilling feedback loop.''
Just days after Washington struck a harrowing, last-minute deal to lift America's debt ceiling, a stark reality has come crashing in on both sides of the Atlantic. Neither the United States nor Europe has yet fully recovered from the financial crisis that spread from spring 2007 through early 2009.
Instead, brief bright spots of recovery have been overshadowed by rising unemployment and anemic economies, especially as debt-reduction austerity programs in Europe and spending cuts in the United States weigh on growth.
Signs of economic weakness continue to emerge. New data indicates that industrial output fell in June in Italy and Spain, and both economies grew at a tepid pace in the second quarter. While the German economy remained strong, industrial production there slid in June, by 1.1 percent, as construction activity also slackened.
Meanwhile, leaders in Brussels on Friday were trying undo the damage wrought by Jose Manuel Barroso, the European Commission president, a day after he frightened investors by conceding that Europe was gripped by political paralysis.
His remarks, which angered German policy makers, were one of the catalysts for the markets' downward spiral Thursday, along with a half-hearted attempt by the European Central Bank to bolster the bonds of the most deeply troubled debtors.
Many analysts say that the inability of politicians to speak with a unified voice, whether about the debt ceiling in the United States or the debt crisis threatening the foundations of the euro monetary union itself, is at the heart of these problems.
China, whose surging growth depends on the West, voiced new worries Friday about the declining fortunes of its two largest trading partners.
''Europe's debt problems are still developing, and the U.S. sovereign debt default risk is escalating,'' China's foreign minister, Yang Jiechi, said during a visit to Poland. He urged all countries to ''further increase communication and coordination.''
Europe's leaders seemed to take the hint -- for now.
''All of us who are in responsible positions in Europe will have to do much better in order to ensure verbal discipline and rigor,'' Ollie Rehn, the European economics commissioner, said at a hastily called news conference in Brussels on Friday.
European officials, he said, were ''working night and day to put flesh on the bones'' of an agreement in principle they struck in July for a second bailout of Greece and to reinforce its sovereign rescue fund, the European Financial Stability Facility. The fund is supposed to keep the economies of Italy and Spain from succumbing to market attacks the way Greece, Ireland and Portugal did.
''Once investors understand that all this work is under way behind the scenes, they will be reassured,'' Mr. Rehn said. ''It is not as if the fundamentals of the Italian or Spanish economies have changed overnight.''
That may be. But with Greece, Ireland and Portugal having received an unprecedented bailout from their European partners, investors are now wary of any country with low growth and high debt -- like Spain and Italy, with their much larger economies.
European parliaments are scheduled to vote on expanding the capacity and scope of the rescue fund after their vacations. But the worry is that financial markets will not wait that long, and will drive up borrowing costs for Italy and Spain to levels that will make it much harder for them to maintain a sustainable debt load.
''If they had agreed on those measures nine months ago it would have prevented the crisis from spiraling to this extent,'' said Simon Tilford, the chief economist at the Center for European Reform in London. ''But this is too little too late.''
For all their declarations, Europe's leaders are still not taking the ultimate step that many analysts say would shore up the euro union: moving toward greater fiscal federalism, a system that would make Europe look more like the United States.
The reasons for resisting are deep-seated: No country wants to give up its sovereignty. Even discussions about issuing euro bonds are met with fierce resistance in Germany, as are ideas for a pan-European financial regulator and Europe-wide deposit insurance to guard against instability in the region's banks.
Germany warned Friday that it would oppose any plan to introduce euro bonds. Joachim Pfeiffer, a lawmaker and economics spokesman for Mrs. Merkel's parliamentary bloc, called them ''poison.''
Another move that critics say would stem the crisis would be for the central bank to buy Italian and Spanish bonds, which would keep their rates from spiraling to the levels that forced Greece and others to take a bailout. But the central bank sees this as a weapon of last resort and is loath to use it.
Mr. Sarkozy has something else to fear. If the crises in Italy and Spain cannot be tamed, France, as one of the major contributors to the cleanup operation, would be in an increasingly weak position.
Spreads on benchmark French bonds have widened against ultrasafe German bonds. And while growth is not lagging, France's structural deficit is high. If the size of the rescue fund were to increase enough to protect Spain and Italy, investors might start to look askance at France's ability to underwrite its share, analysts said.

HEADLINE: Many Questions About Money Remain After Financing Is Restored for F.A.A.

BYLINE: By EDWARD WYATT

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- It took the Senate all of about 30 seconds on Friday to approve a bill that will put 4,000 employees of the Federal Aviation Administration back to work on Monday. Calculating the cost of the 14-day standoff will take much longer.
Democratic and Republican leaders in Congress, meanwhile, made clear on Friday that the fight was not over. The bill, signed into law by President Obama within hours of its approval, expires on Sept. 16. 
Among the costs, of course, is the $388 million, as calculated by the American Association of Airport Executives, in lost revenue from ticket and fuel taxes that the federal government could not collect during the shutdown.
And there could be the salaries of about 3,960 F.A.A. workers who were forced out of work for two weeks and have not been guaranteed that they will receive back pay.
The transportation secretary, Ray LaHood, said Friday that ''as a matter of fairness, we will also do everything we can to get Congress to provide our furloughed employees with the back pay they deserve.'' The 40 airport safety inspectors who were required to work during the shutdown have been promised back pay.
Thousands more construction workers lost income because the F.A.A. halted more than 250 of its own building projects, and many airports asked crews to stop work on airport improvement efforts that they were financing out of their own pockets with the expectation that they would be repaid by the F.A.A.
While the government lost revenue on airline ticket taxes, passengers who paid those taxes will not receive refunds, the Internal Revenue Service said Friday. That reversed its earlier position that passengers could apply for refunds if they had paid the tax before the F.A.A. shutdown on a ticket that was used during the last two weeks.
''The impasse was an unnecessary strain on local economies around the country at a time when we can't allow politics to get in the way of our economic recovery,'' Mr. Obama said Friday in a statement.
While the nation's economy will gain some benefit from the return to work of those idled, the impact was not likely to be as big as many politicians made it out to be. Repeated assertions that 70,000 or more construction workers had lost their jobs because of the F.A.A. shutdown were almost certainly overstated.
The figure came from the Associated General Contractors of America, which estimated last month that 70,000 ''construction and related jobs'' were at risk in an F.A.A. shutdown. The estimate, based on research by Professor Stephen Fuller of George Mason University, included 24,000 construction workers, 11,000 workers in ''service and supply businesses'' and 35,000 jobs that ''will be undermined in the broader economy, from the lunch wagon near the job site to the truck dealership across town.''
Any nuance in that estimate was quickly lost in the parade of dueling news conferences and press releases that Democrats and Republicans used to cast blame for the F.A.A. impasse by pointing fingers across the aisle. Even after a CNN.com article debunked the idea on Thursday morning that 70,000 construction workers had lost work, Democrats and Republicans continued to cite the figure.
The interim financing measure passed by unanimous consent by the Senate on Friday is the 21st short-term measure passed by Congress since the last long-term bill expired in 2007. Both the House and the Senate have approved long-term measures this year, and there are only about a dozen differences remaining between the two bills. Those could be big enough, however, to keep a long-term agreement on ice.
Senator Harry Reid, the Nevada Democrat who is the majority leader, addressed one of those issues on Friday when he said that the F.A.A. employees had been forced out of work ''because Republicans were holding their jobs hostage to try and jam through a favor for the C.E.O. of one airline.''
He was referring to Delta Air Lines, which has lobbied Republicans to roll back a National Mediation Board rule that makes it easier for unions to organize airline workers. Delta said this week that it had never pushed for an F.A.A. shutdown.
Representative John L. Mica, a Florida Republican who is chairman of the House Transportation Committee, fired off his own warning on Friday.
''If the Senate refuses to negotiate on the few remaining issues, they can be assured that every tool at our disposal will be utilized to ensure a long-term bill is signed into law.''

HEADLINE: S.&P. Downgrades Debt Rating Of U.S. For The First Time

BYLINE: By BINYAMIN APPELBAUM and ERIC DASH; Eric Dash contributed reporting from New York.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Standard & Poor's removed the United States government from its list of risk-free borrowers for the first time on Friday night, a downgrade that is freighted with symbolic significance but carries few clear financial implications.
The company, one of three major agencies that offer advice to investors in debt securities, said it was cutting its rating of long-term federal debt to AA+, one notch below the top grade of AAA. It described the decision as a judgment about the nation's leaders, writing that ''the gulf between the political parties'' had reduced its confidence in the government's ability to manage its finances. 
''The downgrade reflects our view that the effectiveness, stability, and predictability of American policymaking and political institutions have weakened at a time of ongoing fiscal and economic challenge,'' the company said in a statement.
The Obama administration reacted with indignation, noting that the company had made a significant mathematical mistake in a document that it provided to the Treasury Department on Friday afternoon, overstating the federal debt by about $2 trillion.
''A judgment flawed by a $2 trillion error speaks for itself,'' a Treasury spokeswoman said.
The downgrade could lead investors to demand higher interest rates from the federal government and other borrowers, raising costs for governments, businesses and home buyers. But many analysts say the impact could be modest, in part because the other ratings agencies, Moody's and Fitch, have decided not to downgrade the government at this time.
The announcement came after markets closed for the weekend, but there was no evidence of any immediate disruption. A spokesman for the Federal Reserve said the decision would not affect the ability of banks to borrow money by pledging government debt as collateral, a statement that could set the tone for the reaction of the broader market.
S.& P. had prepared investors for the downgrade announcement with a series of warnings earlier this year that it would act if Congress did not agree to increase the government's borrowing limit and adopt a long-term plan for reducing its debts by at least $4 trillion over the next decade.
Earlier this week, President Obama signed into law a Congressional compromise that raised the debt ceiling but reduced the debt by at least $2.1 trillion.
On Friday, the company notified the Treasury that it planned to issue a downgrade after the markets closed, and sent the department a copy of the announcement, which is a standard procedure.
A Treasury staff member noticed the $2 trillion mistake within the hour, according to a department official. The Treasury called the company and explained the problem. About an hour later, the company conceded the problem but did not indicate how it planned to proceed, the official said. Hours later, S.& P. issued a revised release with new numbers but the same conclusion.
In a statement early Saturday morning, Standard & Poor's said the difference could be attributed to a ''change in assumptions'' in its methodology but that it had ''no impact on the rating decision.''
In a release on Friday announcing the downgrade, it warned that the government still needed to make progress in paying its debts to avoid further downgrades.
''The downgrade reflects our opinion that the fiscal consolidation plan that Congress and the administration recently agreed to falls short of what, in our view, would be necessary to stabilize the government's medium-term debt dynamics,'' it said.
The credit rating agencies have been trying to restore their credibility after missteps leading to the financial crisis. A Congressional panel called them ''essential cogs in the wheel of financial destruction'' after their wildly optimistic models led them to give top-flight reviews to complex mortgage securities that later collapsed. A downgrade of federal debt is the kind of controversial decision that critics have sometimes said the agencies are unwilling to make.
On the other hand, S.& P. is acting in the face of evidence that investors consider Treasuries among the safest investments in the world. Yields rose before the Congressional deal on fears of default and a possible downgrade. But after a deal was struck, yields sank as money poured into Treasuries as a safe haven from sharply falling stocks and the turmoil of the European debt markets.
On Friday, the price of Treasuries fell sharply in heavy selling, and yields rose, reversing the moves of recent sessions. The 10-year Treasury note ended the day with a yield of 2.56 percent.
The United States has maintained the highest credit rating for decades. S.& P. first designated it AAA in 1941, reflecting a steadfast belief that the richest nation in the world would not default on its debt payments. The rating was also bolstered by the role of the dollar as the world's leading currency, ensuring that demand for American debt securities would remain strong in spite of burgeoning deficits.
''What's changed is the political gridlock,'' said David Beers, S.& P.'s global head of sovereign ratings, in an e-mail several days before a debt ceiling agreement was announced. ''Even now, it's an open question as to whether or when Congress and the administration can agree on fiscal measures that will stabilize the upward trajectory of the U.S. government debt burden.''
Experts say the fallout could be modest.
The federal government makes about $250 billion in interest payments a year, so even a small increase in the rates demanded by investors in United States debt could add tens of billions of dollars to those payments.
In addition, S.& P. may now move to downgrade other entities backed by the government, including Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the government-controlled mortgage companies, raising rates on home mortgage loans for borrowers.
However, because Treasury bonds have always been considered perfectly safe, many rules prohibiting institutions from investing in riskier securities are written as if there were no possibility that the credit rating of Treasuries would be less than stellar.
Banking regulations, for example, accord Treasuries a special status that is not contingent on their rating. The Fed affirmed that status in guidance issued to banks on Friday night. Some investment funds, too, often treat Treasuries as a separate asset category, so that there is no need to sell Treasuries simply because they are no longer rated AAA. In addition, downgrade of long-term Treasury bonds does not affect the short-term federal debt widely held by money market mutual funds.
In other words, almost no one would be precluded from investing in federal debt, and even the ratings agencies have concluded that few investors would walk away voluntarily.

HEADLINE: Russian President Says U.S. Had Role in Georgian Conflict

BYLINE: By ELLEN BARRY

 BODY:
MOSCOW -- In an interview Friday that was timed to the third anniversary of Russia's war with Georgia, President Dmitri A. Medvedev said top United States officials played a key role in events that touched off the war, and offered a withering assessment of a recent Senate resolution on Georgia's behalf, which he said reflected ''the personal tastes of certain elderly members of the Senate.''
They were the toughest remarks Mr. Medvedev has directed toward the United States in months, heightening the impression that the rapprochement between the two countries -- the so-called reset -- is beginning to unravel. Mr. Medvedev dismissed as ''pure provocative nonsense'' the notion that a Russian military intelligence officer was linked to an explosion outside the American Embassy in Tbilisi, a charge that was tentatively corroborated by a United States intelligence assessment that was described to reporters last week. 
Georgia has always been the point of highest tension between the United States and Russia, even as they negotiated on such subjects as Iran's weapons programs, the war in Afghanistan and nuclear nonproliferation. The tension has re-emerged this summer, as both countries head into an election season and with the question of Russia's accession to the World Trade Organization appearing to dominate the agenda for the reset.
Mr. Medvedev cast doubt on that prospect in the interview, conducted at his resort home in Sochi and broadcast on state television. He said Russia would withdraw its application rather than accede to the current demands of Georgia, which, as a W.T.O. member, can block the entry of any new member. Georgia has asked for independent observers to be stationed at the borders between Russia and the enclaves of Abkhazia and South Ossetia; Mr. Medvedev said Russia was willing to offer only electronic monitoring.
''Under the guise of W.T.O. accession, our colleagues in Georgia are trying to push through a new edition of the political problem,'' Mr. Medvedev said. ''We will not fall for it. W.T.O. accession is not too high a price to pay here.''
The 2008 war stripped Georgia of any control over the ethnic enclaves of Abkhazia and South Ossetia, whose separatist governments have long been supported by Russia. It began on Aug. 7, when, after an exchange of artillery fire, the Georgian military shelled the South Ossetian capital of Tskhinvali. The Russian Army poured in, forcing Georgian troops to retreat. Since then, despite Western protests, Russia has remained deeply entrenched in both enclaves, which it has recognized as sovereign nations.
Mr. Medvedev devoted much of the interview to the decisions he made during the confrontation with Georgia, casting himself as a resolute leader who stood up to American pressure. As he waited for President Mikheil Saakashvili to engage in talks with Russia, ''Georgia was getting more and more visits from 'envoys from across the ocean,' as the Soviets would have called them,'' Mr. Medvedev said.
''The moment of truth for me, as I realized later while analyzing those events in hindsight over and over again, came with the visit by Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice,'' he said. ''Following that visit, my Georgian colleague simply dropped all communication with us. He simply stopped talking to us, he stopped writing letters and making phone calls. It was apparent that he had new plans now. And those plans were implemented later.''
Notably, Mr. Medvedev said that he decided to go to war with Georgia without consulting Prime Minister Vladimir V. Putin, and that the two did not even have a conversation until the following day.
In the interview, which was broadcast in Georgia as well, Mr. Medvedev missed no opportunity to denigrate Mr. Saakashvili, describing him as ''a person I will never shake hands with'' and ''a difficult man to avoid, because he is gluey; if he wants to adhere to you, he will do a good job of it.'' He said he would like to see the Georgian leader tried for war crimes, and at times seemed to be goading Mr. Saakashvili, who has expressed persistent anxiety about Russian attempts to undermine his government, both through military force or interference in domestic politics.
After saying it was up to Georgian voters to decide Mr. Saakashvili's future at the polls, he added, ''maybe they could also use other means, the way it sometimes happens in history.'' He added that deposing Mr. Saakashvili three years ago would have been ''a piece of cake,'' but it ''wasn't on my agenda.''
''He should actually be thankful to me for halting our troops at some point,'' Mr. Medvedev said. ''If they had marched into Tbilisi, Georgia would most likely have a different president by now.''

HEADLINE: Prattle and Prejudice

BYLINE: PAUL KRUGMAN


HIGHLIGHT: Mysteries of WSJ economics.

 BODY:
Via Mark Thoma, David Glasner marvels at an utterly incoherent op-ed by David Malpass in the WSJ. The fact that the Journal even invites Malpass to write says volumes: this is, after all, the guy who insisted that American savings were plenty high because of all those capital gains on housing.
But what's really interesting, as Glasner notes, is the incoherence. And this is an issue that goes beyond the woeful Malpass; it pervades the WSJ in general, and is broadly visible in much conservative economic writing, including the academic side.
Think of it this way: there was a time when you could say that the right had a model of how the economy worked. A silly model, yes, since it depended on implausibly large effects of marginal tax rates on incentives. Still, supply-side economics had a point of sorts.
But can you discern any model in what Malpass wrote, or for that matter in almost anything on the WSJ editorial page? I can't. All I see is a bunch of prejudices, strung together with some vaguely economistic-sounding phrases, something like someone talking gibberish that sort of sounds like Swedish. In the world according to the WSJ, low taxes are good (unless the people involved are low income lucky duckies), regulation bad, low inflation good, low interest rates bad, strong dollar good -- and don't ask why. 
The thing is, however, that more or less the same thing, at a subtler level, is going on among famous Republican economists. Read what Robert Barro is saying lately, or Robert Lucas, and try to find any commonality between their explanations of the current slump and what they have been saying about business cycles these past 30 years. I can't.
By contrast, the Krugman/Thoma/DeLong axis (I still like it!) is basically using standard macroeconomics, applied to a nonstandard situation. The Hicks/Keynes model -- in which demand drives output in the short run, interest rates are determined by the tradeoff between liquidity and yield, and extreme negative shocks push you into a liquidity trap in which conventional monetary policy loses traction and deficits don't crowd out private spending -- has worked very well in this crisis, which is why we keep using it with a few twiddles (such as emphasizing the role of private debt).
The point is that at this point we're not having a debate between opposing models; we're having a conflict in which one side has a model that has been working, while the other side has prejudices, and makes stuff up to justify those prejudices.

HEADLINE: The Arithmetic of Near-term Deficits and Debt

BYLINE: PAUL KRUGMAN


HIGHLIGHT: Not what you think.

 BODY:
Amid all the debt hysteria, it's worth taking a look at the actual arithmetic here -- because what this arithmetic says is that the size of the deficit in the next year or two hardly matters for the US fiscal position -- and in fact the size over the next decade is barely significant.
Start with interest rates. What matters for debt sustainability is the real interest rate, since what matters is keeping real debt, not nominal debt, from growing. (World War II debt never got paid off, it just eroded in real terms to the point where it was trivial). As of yesterday, the US government could lock in 30-year bonds at a real interest rate of 1.25%. That means that a trillion dollars in extra debt would mean $12.5 billion a year in additional real interest payments.
Meanwhile, the CBO estimates potential real GDP in 2021 at about $18 trillion in 2005 dollars, or around $19 trillion in 2011 dollars.
Put these together, and they say that an extra trillion in borrowing adds something like 0.07% of GDP in future debt service costs. Yes, that zero belongs there. The $4 trillion S&P said it needed to see clocks in at less than 0.3% of GDP. 
These are not, to say the least, make or break numbers. So what are we talking about here?
America does have a long-run fiscal problem, driven by the combination of rising health costs, an aging population, and the unwillingness to raise taxes to pay for the programs we already have. If we don't come to grips with that problem, bad things will happen. But what happens to the deficit in the medium term is almost irrelevant to the question of whether our long-run finances will get under control. 
Yet S&P (and others) obsess about those medium-term numbers, without ever explaining why. Maybe they think there's some critical level of debt -- but they don't know that. Maybe they think that fiscal austerity over the next decade will somehow guarantee good behavior further out -- but that didn't work in the 1990s. Or maybe they're just pulling stuff out of regions I can't mention in the Times.
The point is that while S&P may try to give the impression that it's just doing the math (incompetently, too!), the math doesn't at all support its position.

HEADLINE: 2011 Tampa Bay Buccaneers Season Preview

BYLINE: ANDY BENOIT


HIGHLIGHT: It's Year Three of what has been a top-to-bottom youth movement in Tampa Bay. The project is going better than planned.

 BODY:
We're entering Year Three of what has been a top-to-bottom youth movement in Tampa Bay. So far, most would agree, it's going better than planned. The team's starting quarterback, running back, wide receivers, defensive ends, defensive tackles, middle linebacker and strong safety enter the season with less than three years of league experience. Yet no eyes rolled when Raheem Morris - who, at 35 on opening day, will still be the youngest head coach in the league - declared this year's goal to be to win the N.F.C. South.
The Buccaneers were 10-6 last year. Still, Morris's lofty ambitions of reaching the postseason fell short (in part because the N.F.L. insists that a team that wins seven games but finishes atop the worst division in history is more deserving of a postseason berth than a team that wins 10 games).
The Bucs are the N.F.L.'s version of "The Sandlot" - watchable for blending sports and youth. Of course, this Sandlot gang faces actual major league competition. Last season, the more "major" the competition, the more callow the Bucs seemed. They were 2-5 against playoff teams, with those two victories coming in Weeks 16 and 17 against the Seahawks and the Saints, neither of whom had anything to play for at the time.But considering that giving games away is part of most young clubs' learning experience, it's impressive that Tampa Bay went 8-1 against non-playoff opponents. It suggests that Morris's players performed to their potential week in and week out.
It helps that the Bucs' "Benny the Jet Rodriguez" plays the most important position on the field. At this albeit extremely early stage, 23-year-old quarterback Josh Freeman appears destined to become a smarter, more mature version of Ben Roethlisberger. A cog like this makes building the rest of the roster much, much easier.
Forty-year-old general manager Mark Dominik has been straightforward about his approach since right out of the gate in '09 when he dumped a handful of veterans and sang the first lines of his now familiar song about rebuilding the franchise from the ground up. This low-cost monogamous commitment to the draft may be influenced by the well-documented financial woes of the Glazer family and poor home attendance figures brought about by an ailing Florida economy. Dominik and Morris insist it comes strictly from a desire to groom their own talent. We may never know the truth; the N.F.L.'s new salary floor does not go in effect on a team-by-team basis until 2013. By then, the Bucs hope to be using their funds for re-signing their own players.
But we're getting ahead of ourselves. Intriguing as it is to see a young team have early success, there's no certainty that this is indeed a 10-win quality club. Let's face it: aberrational seasons happen. And while it's always iffy to tie a pro team's record to the difficulty of its schedule, one could argue that last season wasn't about the Bucs playing up to their potential week in and week out - it was about them getting to play the Panthers twice and the two futile teams from Ohio.
So is Tampa's youthful lineup a result of having a surplus of young talent or a shortage of veteran talent?
Offense
There's no better embodiment of this chicken-or-egg type question than the paradox that is LeGarrette Blount. The undrafted running back from Oregon joined the team last September, cracked the starting lineup in late November and surpassed the 1,000-yard rushing mark in January. Blount was among the league leaders in various broken tackle statistics and finished the season averaging an impressive 5.0 yards per carry.
And yet, put on the tape and it's easy to see why Blount went undrafted (no, character concerns were not the primary reason - they almost never are in the N.F.L.). A roundly built 247-pounder, Blount is far from fast. More damning is he's not powerful. Blount can't seem able to lower his shoulder and deliver a great blow. At times, he even stops his feet and braces for contract. His timing and vision are unrefined, and his blocking and receiving skills are poor.
Still, Blount is able to produce, mainly as a lumbering runner who's difficult to bring down in the open field (think of a bear that's been just shot with a tranquilizing dart). But this kind of style makes for an inconsistent rushing attack. Blount might put up yardage, but defenses have no reason to fear him. And it's still to be determined whether such a punishing style can be sustained for an entire 16-game slate (Blount played in 13 games last season, starting seven).
The Bucs are prepared to ride the mudder because they have no other options (i.e. there's a shortage of veteran talent). Cadillac Williams washed up last year and is now gone. The penciling of Earnest Graham's name at fullback seems to have been written over permanent ink. Thus, the top backup is Allen Bradford, a sixth-round rookie who, at 242 pounds, figures to have a similar between-the-tackles style as Blount. Before Labor Day, expect the Bucs to acquire a third-down back. Last season, Josh Freeman completed 46 passes to Cadillac Williams, almost all of which were dumpoffs.
As Freeman develops, the dumpoff passes will become less frequent. His remarkable attributes - such as the size to shed would-be sackers, or the athleticism and arm strength to make stick throws downfield while on the move - are a reminder of Roethlisberger. But unlike Roethlisberger, Freeman seems to have a grasp for winning the down before the snap. His diagnostic acumen has improved with each start, which is equally as important as his penchant for conjuring big plays in critical situations.
A key in the passing game's growth will be Freeman and his receivers becoming more cohesive at reading blitzes. Too often the Buccaneers get caught in five-and seven-step-drop play designs when they should be executing three-step hot routes. These are things that get fixed with experience, though if the Bucs are going to rely on two second-year starters out wide (Mike Williams and Arrelious Benn), it's on coordinator Greg Olson and receivers coach Tim Berbenich to help accelerate the learning process.
As with Blount, there seems to be a national movement to declare Williams a star. Williams is better than his fourth-round draft status, but he doesn't have the explosive elevation or straight-line speed of a true No. 1. The original plan was for the second-rounder Benn to become the No. 1. However, Benn struggled to grasp the system before blowing out his knee late last year. He has been able to fully partake in the start of training camp, so don't expect hit-or-miss playmaker Michael Spurlock or the moderately shifty Sammie Stroughter (whom coaches prefer to use in the slot) to capture the other starting job. The Bucs will most likely be a little patient with Benn.
Tampa's best receiving weapon is clearly tight end Kellen Winslow. It would be wise for Olson to make a more concerted effort at featuring the fluid, versatile eighth-year veteran. (Winslow led the team with 66 catches last season but was too often an afterthought in the game plan.)
Winslow is a willing but underwhelming blocker, which could be a problem considering that veteran backup tight end John Gilmore is gone and new fourth-round rookie tight end Luke Stocker figures to be somewhat of a project in this realm. Edge blocking assistance will be crucial on the right side, where tackle Jeremy Trueblood has seemingly made "getting beat" a form of art. The reason he's back in the starting lineup is because the only player on the team who's seemingly less confident happens to be his backup, James Lee. Filling in for holdout left tackle Donald Penn last season, Lee admitted to not feeling qualified to start. He backed up those words in a cameo appearance down the stretch when coaches sent Trueblood to the pine. Penn, of course, is under contract long-term this season and can handle the left side adequately. He's a decent pass-blocker and needs to become a better run-blocker (he's a good downhill mover for someone shaped like a workout ball).
Re-signing Davin Joseph was Dominik's top priority this past off-season, even though the right guard uncharacteristically struggled before his season-ending foot injury. Left guard Ted Larsen has some trouble sustaining power but shows decent short-area mobility in the run game. It's critical he get plenty of reps with gritty veteran center Jeff Faine; injuries killed the cohesion of this interior offensive line last season, which was part of the reason the Bucs were so vulnerable to fire-X and other A-gap blitzes.
Defense
Raheem Morris is willing to go after the quarterback out of Tampa Bay's three-man sub-packages, but many of the basics in his defensive philosophy are still those of a traditional Cover 2. A Cover 2 requires generating pressure from a four-man defensive line. This explains why Dominik spent his first two draft picks in '10 on tackles (Gerald McCoy and Brian Price) and the first two draft picks this season on ends (Adrian Clayborn and Da'Quan Bowers).
The jury is still out on McCoy, though the early prognosis is "good pick." Even while struggling to learn multiple positions last season, McCoy flashed the powerful initial quickness to justify his No. 3 overall status. His wish to work out of just one position this season has been granted, so assuming his surgically repaired left biceps holds up, he could emerge as a star. Price, on the other hand, is still a mystery after injuries, and the stellar play of nose tackle Roy Miller kept him out of the lineup for most of 2010.
Equally mysterious is Bowers, once projected as the top pick of the draft. He plummeted all the way to Pick 51 because of a knee problem. If Bowers, who figures to be a three-down end, can't stay on the field, the Bucs will fall back (way back) on last year's starter, Michael Bennett. There's also third-year pro Kyle Moore, though he can't hold ground against the run.
Because of the nature of the zone coverage techniques in a Cover 2, cornerbacks are considered part of the defensive run front. This affords the defense the option of letting runs bounce outside. But it also requires the linebackers to get to the ball quicker than in most schemes, as there's very little time to read and react. It's a tall order, and one the Bucs, frankly, don't have the linebacking personnel to fill.
Outside linebacker Quincy Black has the raw speed and open-space tackling aptitude to operate in this scheme, but his smaller stature (6'2", 240) is problematic for getting off blocks. Despite this, and a vulnerability to injuries, Black was re-signed to a five-year, $29.5 million contract over the off-season. He'll continue to start opposite Geno Hayes, a fourth-year pro with questionable instincts.
Don't listen to the people who express shock that middle linebacker Barrett Ruud was not re-signed. His lack of physicality and Buddhist-like willingness to just sit back and let the ballcarrier come to were the primary reasons this run defense ranked in the bottom two for yards allowed per carry each of the past two years. There's no guarantee that either Tyrone McKenzie, an oft-injured third-round pick of the Patriots in '09, or Mason Foster, an out-of-position third-round pick of the Bucs this past April, will be able to fill Ruud's old position. But any change at this spot is worth a shot.
An examination of each player's skills might lead one to conclude that the Bucs have five linebackers in their starting lineup. But two of those linebackers - Sean Jones and Cody Grimm - are actually safeties. Both are emphatic in traffic and iffy in space, which presents the exact pluses and minuses you'd expect. At one time there were whispers about moving 36-year-old corner Ronde Barber to safety. Though he's lost a step in man coverage, Barber is too valuable as an X-factor in the slot to play in center field. The only better blitzing cornerback in football is Charles Woodson.
In nickel, Barber will slide inside and either E.J. Biggers (who can be surprisingly effective in deep man coverage) or Myron Lewis (who was drafted in Round Three last year to hopefully become the long-term No. 2 corner) will align outside.
Shadowing the opposing team's top receiver will be Aqib Talib, who could be facing a major suspension after his felony assault charges from an off-season shooting (the trial is set for 2012). It was initially presumed that the Bucs would cut the troubled Talib. The reason the team hasn't is they simply don't make enough 6'1" ball hawks with such fluid change-of-direction ability.
Special Teams
Connor Barth is an everyman kicker: accurate inside of 40 yards, hit-or-miss beyond that. Michael Koenen comes over from Atlanta to punt and share secrets about his former team. (You'll never believe it: Matt Ryan doesn't actually shave with Gillette Fusion in the shower!) Return specialist Michael Spurlock is capable of occasional magic but doesn't quite have the wiggle to create his own space on punts.
Bottom Line
This young team will be better than it was a year ago because, if nothing else, of the laws of nature. But improvements may not translate into victories given the harder schedule, shortened off-season (which hurt young players most) and higher expectations.

Outside linebacker Quincy Black has the raw speed and open-space tackling aptitude to operate in this scheme, but his smaller stature (6'2", 240) is problematic for getting off blocks. Despite this, and a vulnerability to injuries, Black was re-signed to a five-year, $29.5 million contract over the off-season. He'll continue to start opposite Geno Hayes, a fourth-year pro with questionable instincts.
Don't listen to the people who express shock that middle linebacker Barrett Ruud was not re-signed. His lack of physicality and Buddhist-like willingness to just sit back and let the ballcarrier come to were the primary reasons this run defense ranked in the bottom two for yards allowed per carry each of the past two years. There's no guarantee that either Tyrone McKenzie, an oft-injured third-round pick of the Patriots in '09, or Mason Foster, an out-of-position third-round pick of the Bucs this past April, will be able to fill Ruud's old position. But any change at this spot is worth a shot.
An examination of each player's skills might lead one to conclude that the Bucs have five linebackers in their starting lineup. But two of those linebackers - Sean Jones and Cody Grimm - are actually safeties. Both are emphatic in traffic and iffy in space, which presents the exact pluses and minuses you'd expect. At one time there were whispers about moving 36-year-old corner Ronde Barber to safety. Though he's lost a step in man coverage, Barber is too valuable as an X-factor in the slot to play in center field. The only better blitzing cornerback in football is Charles Woodson.
In nickel, Barber will slide inside and either E.J. Biggers (who can be surprisingly effective in deep man coverage) or Myron Lewis (who was drafted in Round Three last year to hopefully become the long-term No. 2 corner) will align outside.
Shadowing the opposing team's top receiver will be Aqib Talib, who could be facing a major suspension after his felony assault charges from an off-season shooting (the trial is set for 2012). It was initially presumed that the Bucs would cut the troubled Talib. The reason the team hasn't is they simply don't make enough 6'1" ball hawks with such fluid change-of-direction ability.
Special Teams
Connor Barth is an everyman kicker: accurate inside of 40 yards, hit-or-miss beyond that. Michael Koenen comes over from Atlanta to punt and share secrets about his former team. (You'll never believe it: Matt Ryan doesn't actually shave with Gillette Fusion in the shower!) Return specialist Michael Spurlock is capable of occasional magic but doesn't quite have the wiggle to create his own space on punts.
Bottom Line
This young team will be better than it was a year ago because, if nothing else, of the laws of nature. But improvements may not translate into victories given the harder schedule, shortened off-season (which hurt young players most) and higher expectations.

HEADLINE: A 'AAA' Q. and A.

BYLINE: FLOYD NORRIS


HIGHLIGHT: Answers to frequently asked questions about the U.S. debt crisis and the ratings agencies.

 BODY:
7:12 p.m. | Updated to elaborate on bank bailout.
Q.
Why did Standard & Poor's lower the credit rating of the United States to AA+?
A.
The rating agency thinks the United States has too much debt, or at least will: "Under our revised base case fiscal scenario -- which we consider to be consistent with a AA+ long-term rating and a negative outlook -- we now project that net general government debt would rise from an estimated 74 percent of G.D.P. by the end of 2011 to 79 percent in 2015 and 85 percent by 2021."
Q.
Why is the debt so high?
A.
One reason is that the government had to spend huge sums to bail out the banks and try to offset the impact of the deep recession caused by the financial crisis. It looks as if the government will more or less break even on the bank bailouts, but it cannot recoup the money it had to spend to keep the economy afloat.
Q.
Did S.&P. issue warnings when the mistakes leading to the financial crisis were being made?
A.
No. One cause of the crisis was that S.&P. and its competitors handed out AAA ratings to almost anyone who wanted one for a mortgage-backed security. They did that even for securities whose only source of repayment was subprime mortgages issued to buyers with poor credit who had taken out what were known as "liars' loans" because no one checked to see if they had any income at all.
Q.
Why did they do that?
A.
They had models that showed a lot of such mortgages would never default.
Q.
Are those securities still AAA?
A.
No. Many of them are rated in the lower regions of junk. It turned out there were a lot of defaults.
Q.
Does this mean that S.&P. thinks the U.S. ability to meet its obligations is in question?
A.
No. It knows the United States borrows in dollars, and also has a dollar printing press. The recent Congressional circus raised some fears the country would refuse to pay, but that seems to have passed.
Q.
There have been complaints that the rating agencies are always behind the market. Is that true this time?
A.
No. In recent months, Treasury borrowings costs have declined, because investors around the world engaged in a flight to safety. The market thinks there is nothing safer than a Treasury bill.
Q.
How have other AAA countries done?
A.
Generally O.K. But rates have gone up in France because of worries about the euro and a recognition that France, unlike the United States, does not have the ability to print the currency it must repay.
Q.
So the market seems more concerned about France, but S.&P. does not. Is that because France has less debt outstanding?
A.
No. S.&P. believes that in 2015 France's debt will be 83 percent of its GDP, compared to 79 percent in the U.S. But it thinks France will do a better job of bringing down budget deficits.
Q.
So the market seems to have a different view than does S.&P. of the relative merits of U.S. and French debt? Whom should I believe?
A.
That is up to you. But the market figured out subprime mortgage securities were junk long before S.&P.
Q.
So the U.S. debt is up partly because S.&P. was incompetent before the financial crisis. Is there any particular reason to assume they know what they are doing now?
A.
Next question.
Q.
What impact will this have on trading in Treasuries in coming days?
A.
There is no way to be sure. Anything that causes a lot of people to sell a security is likely to cause prices to fall. But it is hard to see there is any new information in S.&P.'s report.

HEADLINE: The Talk About the Downgrade

BYLINE: ELIZABETH A. HARRIS


HIGHLIGHT: A flurry of reaction on the news programs to the decision to downgrade U.S. debt.

 BODY:
Standard & Poor's downgraded the United State's long-term federal debt for the first time in history Friday, dropping the rating one notch to AA+ from AAA.
Standard & Poor's, one of the three major rating agencies that evaluates debt, said in a statement that "the downgrade reflects our view that the effectiveness, stability, and predictability of American policy making and political institutions have weakened at a time of ongoing fiscal and economic challenges."
Within minutes, current and former government officials were on television discussing and condemning the decision, which the Obama administration said was based on an evaluation that included a $2 trillion error. Meanwhile, John Chambers, the head of Standard & Poor's sovereign debt ratings, went on the defensive.
On CNN's "Anderson Cooper 360" late Friday, Mr. Chambers said, "the political brinkmanship we saw over raising the debt ceiling was something that was really beyond our expectations." Mr. Chambers, however, declined to assign blame to Democrats or Republicans.
"There's plenty of blame to go around," he said. "This is a problem that's been a long time in the making."
Mr. Cooper shared the floor with a former federal comptroller general, David M. Walker, inviting him to ask questions of Mr. Chambers, as well.
Mr. Walker asked the Standard & Poor's executive whether the United States might regain its AAA credit rating if the government were to cut $4 trillion from the deficit over the next 10 years (the figure that the agency has cited as necessary for the United States to keep a top-notch rating).
"It's going to take a while to get back to triple-A, because once you lose your triple-A it doesn't usually bounce back in that way," Mr. Chambers said.
On the same CNN program, Mr. Walker told Mr. Cooper that he was "not totally surprised" by the downgrade and explained what the effects might be on interest rates and consumers.
 Representative Barney Frank, Democrat of Massachusetts and the ranking member of the House Financial Services Committee, joined "The Rachel Maddow Show" on MSNBC by telephone Friday night. Mr. Frank dismissed the downgrade as unwarranted and questioned the record of Standard & Poor's.
"This is the rating agency that took money from the people who were selling junk bonds, and told other people to buy it," Mr. Frank said. He also claimed that the ratings agency had a history of over-valuing the debt of private companies while under-valuing public debt. (The interview with Mr. Frank begins in the video below around 4 minutes and 35 seconds.)

HEADLINE: Sunday Breakfast Menu, Aug. 7

BYLINE: EMMARIE HUETTEMAN


HIGHLIGHT: It's been a big week for the economy, and the Sunday shows are talking about it.

 BODY:
The last week has seen an 11th-hour deal to avert a government default, a stock market plunge, a cautiously positive jobs report and the nation's first credit rating downgrade in history. Naturally, the Sunday talk shows will be focused on the economy.
"Fox News Sunday" features David Beers, a credit analyst at Standard & Poor's, who will discuss the decision that he and other S.&P. analysts made to downgrade the country's credit rating.
Representative Paul Ryan, the Wisconsin Republican who serves as chairman of the House Budget Committee, and Bill Miller, chief investment officer of Legg Mason Capital Management, will also be on Fox to talk about the economy and July's job growth.
Also on Fox: the Republican presidential candidate Tim Pawlenty, who joins the other Republican candidates in Iowa this week for a debate and the straw poll in Ames.
Two former presidential nominees -- Senator John Kerry, Democrat of Massachusetts, and Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona -- join "Meet the Press" on NBC to weigh in on the unemployment situation and the struggling economy. Also, NBC brings in the former chairman of the Federal Reserve Alan Greenspan and President Obama's former chief economic adviser, Austan Goolsbee, who left his post on Friday.
Talking about the nation's economic outlook on "Face the Nation" on CBS will be President Obama's campaign strategist and former senior adviser David Axelrod; Senator Lindsey Graham, the South Carolina Republican who serves on the Senate Budget Committee; and Howard Dean, the former Vermont governor who was chairman of the Democratic National Committee.
Senator Jeff Sessions, the Alabama Republican who is the ranking member of the Budget Committee, and Gov. Martin O'Malley of Maryland, chairman of the Democratic Governors Association, appear on "This Week" on ABC.
Larry Summers, a former Treasury secretary and former director of the National Economic Council, and Steve Forbes, president and chief executive of Forbes Inc., will be on CNN's "State of the Union" to discuss jobs and the economy. Also, the former White House communications director Anita Dunn and the former Republican congressman Thomas M. Davis III discuss the politics of the deal to raise the debt ceiling.
Also on CNN: Gov. Jerry Brown of California, in his first national interview since being elected, will talk about California and the state of the nation as a whole.
Then, the subject turns to foreign affairs and security. Vice Admiral Mike McConnell, retired, the former director of national intelligence, discusses the violence in Syria, as well as cybersecurity in the wake of the reports of attacks originating in China.
Bloomberg's "Political Capital" has Carmen M. Reinhart, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The former treasurer Rosario Marin and the former housing secretary Henry G. Cisneros join Univision's "Al Punto" to discuss how the debt ceiling deal will affect the economy.
And C-Span's "Newsmakers" is talking about Africa with Representative Christopher H. Smith, the New Jersey Republican who is chairman of the House Foreign Services Africa subcommittee. The devastating famine in Somalia and tensions between Sudan and the newly formed South Sudan are on the agenda.

HEADLINE: Candidates Give Obama an F for AA+ Rating

BYLINE: JEFF ZELENY


HIGHLIGHT: The Republican presidential candidates seized on the first-ever downgrade of the nation's credit rating as a new line of criticism against President Obama, suggesting that ultimate responsibility rested in the Oval Office even though the rating agency, Standard &#038; Poor's, cited the overall political gridlock in Washington as a major cause for its decision.

 BODY:
CEDAR RAPIDS, Iowa - The Republican presidential candidates on Saturday seized on the first-ever downgrade of the nation's credit rating as a new line of criticism against President Obama, suggesting that ultimate responsibility rested in the Oval Office even though the rating agency, Standard & Poor's, cited the overall political gridlock in Washington as a major cause for its decision.
"It happened on your watch, Mr. President," Michele Bachmann, the Minnesota representative and Tea Party caucus leader, said, drawing applause at an afternoon rally here. "You were AWOL. You were missing in action."
She criticized the president for spending the day at Camp David.
"I'm calling on the president of the United States to come back to the White House," Mrs. Bachmann said, "address the American people before the markets open on Monday and give us his positive plan for putting the ratings back up to the AAA rating."
The political recriminations were swift over the decision by S.& P., one of the major credit rating agencies, to take the unprecedented step of downgrading the credit of the United States government. It became an instant addition to the growing critique being built on the campaign trail against the president by Republicans fighting to win their party's nomination.
As former Gov. Tim Pawlenty of Minnesota campaigned in Grinnell on Saturday, he declared: "What we should be talking about is downgrading Barack Obama from president of the United States."
Former Gov. Mitt Romney of Massachusetts, who arrives in Iowa next week for a Republican presidential debate, said in a written statement that the credit rating decision "is a deeply troubling indicator of our country's decline under President Obama."
The decision by S.& P. became a central part of Mrs. Bachmann's presentation on Saturday as she met voters in Cedar Rapids and later in Waterloo, the city of her childhood, where she announced her candidacy in June. She warned voters that the credit downgrade "means higher interest rates for everyone."
"Last night, we had our day of reckoning," Mrs. Bachmann said. "Eventually it hits the fan."
In Congress earlier this week, she was among the House Republicans who voted against raising the debt ceiling and the budget compromise that was negotiated by Speaker John A. Boehner and Republican leader in the Senate, Mitch McConnell. She singled out Mr. Obama for criticism, but she said there was plenty of blame to go around.
"The responsibility is of those in Washington, D.C., who put the deal together," Mrs. Bachmann said in a brief exchange with reporters. "But the real problem in all of this is that President Obama has failed to give leadership on this issue."

HEADLINE: Criticism of Shale Gas Articles, and of the Critic

 BODY:
Two columns on articles by Ian Urbina about the development of shale gas drew strong responses. Here's what some readers said in response to my July 17 piece discussing Mr. Urbina's June 26 article about gas producers' allegedly exaggerated claims.
Arthur S. Brisbane, public editor 
Your Public Editor piece ''Clashing Views on the Future of Natural Gas'' (July 17) commits some of the same errors that you attribute to Ian Urbina's articles.
You complain that Mr. Urbina didn't include statements from experts ''not entrenched on one side or another,'' but you rely heavily on the M.I.T. natural gas study group, which has been consistently pro-drilling and has strong industry connections, as if it was neutral.
The ''boom'' in natural gas production is real enough, but that is arguably precisely part of the problem. In economic terms booms are not necessarily a good thing; they are commonly followed by busts.
You suggest that energy giants like Exxon Mobil would not invest in a Ponzi scheme, though smaller companies might, as Mr. Urbina suggests. But if the last three years of financial history have taught us anything it is that large corporations have no monopoly on virtue and good behavior. You seem to have forgotten about the poor performance of BP after the Gulf of Mexico oil blowout last year.
You say his article should have included ''more space for a reasoned explanation from the other side.'' But there is no reason to presume that the truth must be evenly balanced. What would you have to say about balance in a debate between slaveholders and abolitionists?
ADRIAN KUZMINSKI Moderator, Sustainable Otsego Fly Creek, N.Y.
It's dismaying that Arthur S. Brisbane sees fit to stake his criticism of Ian Urbina's coverage on the observation that explosive growth in gas exploration wasn't acknowledged. How odd -- wasn't a central point of the article that this has the feel of a bubble (and all the excess, including boom growth, that that implies)?
DUANE SCHRAG Abilene, Kan.
Mr. Urbina is right on. He is up against a powerful P.R. machine. Thank God he has the courage to speak up on this important issue.
RICHARD YANOCK Washington, Pa.
Thank you for calling attention to Ian Urbina's confused reporting about the transformational oil shale business and his insistence that natural gas executives may be exaggerating the reserves.
First, there is an immense glut of natural gas in this country, as witnessed by the failure of natural gas to spike in record cold and record heat, as it always did before the shale discoveries. Second, we now have discovered so much natural gas in this country that oil and gas companies are mothballing gigantic facilities that were built to import natural gas from overseas. Many industry executives now expect that we will be exporting natural gas, as our production costs are now the lowest in the world.
Third, Mr. Urbina asserts that shale production falls rapidly after a short time. Actually, the production has increased over time and the initial projections in all the major shales have gone up, and up dramatically, from their initial discoveries. Fourth, both national oil companies and major integrated oils, including Korean, Japanese, Chinese, Norwegian and Indian companies as well as Exxon Mobil, have spent tens of billions of dollars buying up domestic shale properties.
Could all of these entities be wrong and Mr. Urbina right? I don't think so.
JIM CRAMER Host, ''Mad Money'' on CNBC
I was so happy to read Mr. Brisbane's critique of the Times report on the ''financially dangerous'' business of drilling for natural gas in U.S. shale plays. I was a Wall Street energy analyst for 25 years, and nothing in the June 26 article rang true to me.
Mr. Brisbane said that the Times reporter was referring only to a handful of independent exploration companies. Perhaps. But to argue that Big Oil has no stake in shale gas is simply false. Exxon just paid $41 billion to purchase XTO Energy -- largely for that company's shale gas. Chevron earlier this year agreed to pay $4 billion to acquire the Pennsylvania shale gas producer Atlas Energy. And in July, the Australian resource giant BHP announced that it would buy U.S.-based Petrohawk Energy -- another shale gas player -- in an all-cash deal worth $12 billion.
The major oil companies are voting with their pocketbooks and saying that shale gas economics look good to them!

On Redacted E-mails
The letters below came in response to my July 31 column, ''Why Redacting E-Mails Is a Bad Idea,'' on Mr. Urbina's subsequent shale gas article on June 27, which reported on dissent within the Energy Information Administration about shale gas prospects. The article relied in part on redacted e-mails from employees of the agency. Arthur S. Brisbane
One of the real values of your articles is naming Times reporters and editors who are involved in the issues you raise, and holding them to account in a manner that often makes them feel compelled to respond. Apart from your comments on the relevant substantive issues, the identification of reporters and editors who need to account for what seems to be a breakdown in following norms and exercising care may be the most important aspect of your columns. Hopefully, it may have long-lasting deterrent effects. This column was particularly helpful because it identified a collateral effect of publishing anonymous sources that had not been sufficiently emphasized, namely, how their use can sway the reporting.
NAPOLEON WILLIAMS Manhattan
I think the use of the word ''redact'' in this situation is misleading. It implies some complicated but necessary process but all it actually means is editing -- cutting out.
This article was misleading because crucial information was left out (or ''redacted''), and that will always cause a problem, whether editing audiotaped, written or e-mailed information!

HEADLINE: A Thriving Growth Area In a Weak Economy: Hair

BYLINE: By SABRINA TAVERNISE

 BODY:
CAPITOL HEIGHTS, Md. -- In low-slung suburban strip malls, nestled among fast-food restaurants and auto supply stores, hair salons are sprouting like mushrooms.
The Census Bureau recently noted their jump in an otherwise glum report about mom-and-pop businesses, stating that the number of hairdressers and barbers and the shops they work in grew by about 8 percent from 2008 to 2009, one of the few industries to register growth in a tough economic climate.
It seems that getting a haircut is one expense that consumers are reluctant to give up. And people who run salons never have to fret that their work might be outsourced. ''We don't have to worry about someone flying to China to get their hair cut,'' said Charles Kirkpatrick, director of the National Association of Barber Boards of America. ''Barbering is not going away.'' 
Here in Prince George's County, the number of hairstylists and beauty salons rose by 10 percent from 2008 to 2009, according to the census data, which came from a survey of the country's smallest businesses, owned and operated by a single person. In Washington, they jumped 18 percent.
One reason may be that people who were battered in the economic downturn turned to haircutting as a quick career change. Fabulocs, a hair salon in Capitol Heights, employs several refugees from the recession. One has a master's degree in education. Another worked as a manager at a Circuit City store. Seven of the nine stylists there had been to college.
''It's a sensitive subject,'' said Nimat Bilal-Young, 34, the owner. ''That moment of, 'You've got a master's degree and you're a stylist?' ''
Ms. Bilal-Young has tapped into a growing demand among black women for natural hairstyles. Her salon now has 12,000 Facebook followers, a line of hair care products and more clients than she can handle. She is considering franchising.
''It's not like other industries where you're trying to find customers,'' she said. ''The customers are trying to find you.''
Tarsa Scott, a single mother, started working with hair in 2008 after her business as a real estate broker dried up. She works full time as an administrator for the United Negro College Fund but supplements her income with work at the salon at night and on Saturdays.
''I wanted to do something the market wouldn't have such a drastic effect on,'' said Ms. Scott, 37. ''Women may slow down with how often they get their hair done, but they'll always get it done.''
Customers at the salon said they refused to cut back on the money they spent on their hair, even as they scrimped on things like vacations. ''It's just part of my budget, like keeping the lights on,'' said Rochelle Mills, 38, who works at the Department of Justice. ''I'll forgo a lot of things, but not my hair.''
Getting your hair done, said Ms. Bilal-Young, ''is like when your house is clean. Everything seems better.''
The number of barber licenses across the country has been rising, with about 250,000 now, said Mr. Kirkpatrick of the Association of Barber Boards, up from 190,000 in the 1980s. Since 2008, the number of barber licenses in Maryland has increased by more than 60 percent to about 5,000 now, according to Phil Mazza, a member of the State Board of Cosmetologists.
Another reason for the rising number of haircutters could be the hot weather in recent years, Mr. Kirkpatrick mused. Or the fact that the country has been at war for the past decade, and the military is setting a broader style for short locks.
Or even, he said, the recession.
''There are people saying, 'I got to look good, I'm trying to get a job,' '' he said. ''And you know, a bad attitude with a good haircut can fool you sometimes.''

HEADLINE: Some Concern Abroad About U.S. Downgrade

BYLINE: By LIZ ALDERMAN; Jack Ewing contributed reporting from Frankfurt

 BODY:
PARIS -- Europe was taken aback Saturday at the unprecedented downgrade of America's sterling sovereign credit rating, as officials of the Group of 7 industrial countries prepared to hold an extraordinary conference call on Sunday to discuss the debt crisis that has beset Europe and the United States.
Jean-Claude Trichet, the president of the European Central Bank, planned to convene a late-afternoon call Sunday from his vacation in France with the heads of Europe's national central banks as they gird for what is expected to be a rocky opening of financial markets on Monday. 
The news that Standard & Poor's had lowered Washington's AAA rating to AA+ was received with some concern in the corridors of power in Europe and spurred flurries of calls and meetings by officials around the world as the crisis risked spinning beyond their control.
In the meantime, the French finance minister, Francois Baroin, questioned the downgrade, which he said appeared to be based on ''nonconsensual figures.'' The Obama administration had disputed the judgment, noting that Standard & Poor's had made a significant mathematical mistake and overstated the federal debt by about $2 trillion.
Standard & Poor's said the downgrade was based more on the view that the effectiveness, stability and predictability of American policy making had eroded during the rancorous debate over lifting the debt ceiling. Mr. Baroin said he found it curious that neither Moody's nor Fitch, the two other major ratings agencies, had reached a similar conclusion. Moody's has said that it was keeping its AAA rating on the nation's debt, but that it still might lower it.
''We have total confidence in the solidity of the American economy,'' Mr. Baroin said in an interview on French radio. Nonetheless, he added, the decision ''confirms'' that the world's most developed economies are confronted with the same urgent priorities: to lift growth and reduce public and private debt.
Prime Minister Julia Gillard of Australia also warned against overreacting to the downgrade.
Standard & Poor's ''had been signaling for some time that unless they saw a certain figure of budget cutbacks out of the discussion that there's been in Washington about the American budget and fiscal consolidation, that they were intending to do that downgrade,'' Ms. Gillard said, according to Agence-France Presse. ''At the same time, the other two major ratings agencies, Moody's and Fitch, continue to have the American economy rated at AAA. So I think people just need to look at all of the facts.''
In Germany, commentators saw the downgrade as further evidence of the decline of American prestige.
The weekly newsmagazine Focus called the downgrade ''a public humiliation.''
The magazine noted a scolding that the United States received from Chinese officials.
''Now the country must allow itself to be reprimanded and lectured before the eyes of the world,'' Focus said, referring to the United States.
During their telephone conference, Group of 7 ministers are expected to discuss ways to ready themselves if financial markets continue to spiral lower. Reuters reported that ministers of the Group of 20 industrialized and developing nations held a conference call Saturday night.
Several political leaders kept in touch while on vacation. President Nicolas Sarkozy of France was expected to speak with Prime Minister David Cameron of Britain. On Monday, Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi of Italy, a country that is considered Europe's new weak link, is scheduled to speak with President Obama, according to an Italian official who was not authorized to speak publicly.
The possibility that the Washington's sterling sovereign rating would be tarnished, together with the dawning realization that the United States and Europe may be grappling with fundamental problems in their economies for years to come, stoked the worst global sell-off of stocks this week since the financial crisis blew open in 2008.
Yet even with Standard & Poor's downgrade, American debt is still seen as one of the world's safest investments. The action may lift borrowing costs on a variety of debt around the world, though perhaps not enough to do serious damage.
That is cold comfort to China, the largest foreign holder of American debt. The country has issued several warnings to Washington. On Saturday, just hours after the downgrade, Beijing admonished the Obama administration to ''cure its addiction to debts'' and ''live within its means.''
One senior European official who has been involved in debt crisis negotiations said that Europeans were ''not especially happy'' about the downgrade decision but that there was a feeling that the ratings agency was fair in its relative treatment of Europe and the United States.
''We all feel the consequences of the crisis on our public finances,'' the official said, ''and we all need to take serious action to restore their sustainability while being attentive to the strengthening of growth.''
While the political atmosphere in the United States has not been helpful in that regard, the official added, the ruling was unlikely to ''aggravate things for us.''
Still, it confirms that sovereign risks are not totally risk-free and that governments must prove they are undertaking sounder governance and greater sustainability of public finances, the official added.
Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, who spent hours on the phone Friday talking with President Obama, President Sarkozy and the leaders of Italy and Spain, did not issue a statement on Saturday.
But German newspapers summed up the general sentiment, with Die Welt calling the news a ''thunderbolt'' and saying that Standard & Poor's was ''brave'' to downgrade the United States's credit rating.
''This is not Spain or Ireland,'' the normally pro-American Die Welt said.
''This is the debtor nation U.S.A., that in contrast to other countries has always fulfilled its obligations.''
The daily Suddeutsche Zeitung said that Germany might even profit from the downgrade, because money could flow to safe-haven investments like German bunds. ''This effect could become even stronger following the downgrade of the U.S.,'' the newspaper said.
Philipp Rosler, the German economics minister, said he did not want to comment on decisions by ratings agencies. But he told the newspaper Bild am Sonntag, ''It's obvious that the competitiveness of the economies of other countries is also an important issue for us.''

HEADLINE: Back to the Simple Life, With Needle and Thread

BYLINE: By LIZ ROBBINS

 BODY:
WALK into the modest railroad-style brownstone apartment and it feels less like Brooklyn and more like stepping off the steam train into ''Little House on the Park Slope Prairie.''
Floppy felt hats with broad rims gather like old friends on an antique green rack, greeting visitors at the door. Simple striped yellow, white and gray curtains adorn the front windows.
In the middle room, linen and raw-silk blankets sit with seersucker pillowcases atop cotton sheets. A white linen pinafore dress with a ruffled chiffon hem hangs in the sparse closet next to a flamenco flannel skirt and dozens of other colorful creations. T-shirts, tank tops and lingerie are folded into neat squares on small shelves, and wooden hooks hold just-worn items. 
A wicker basket on the floor fills with laundry that never felt so satisfying.
Sarah Kate Beaumont sewed all of these items one by one over the past three years in what began as an experiment of self-reliance and artistic whimsy and has now blossomed into a way of life.
That life may hark back to pioneer days, but Ms. Beaumont is not homesteading alone.
Brooklyn, fiercely proud of its independence from Manhattan, is an expanding frontier for the Do It Yourself movement -- resourceful residents are baking bread, raising chickens for eggs, keeping bees for honey or simply renovating brownstones themselves. Ms. Beaumont, a shy woman in her early 40s with auburn curls, settles as comfortably into that ethos as she does into her flowing dresses.
''I never intended to do it this long,'' she said softly on a recent afternoon. ''I think it speaks to how good it feels. Self-reliance is really empowering.''
Ms. Beaumont began sewing to live in the summer of 2008, when after eight years of teaching art in the city's public and private schools, she decided to become a full-time artist. Her dream was to share her craft by teaching adult sewing classes. Because the timing coincided with the financial collapse, she altered the dream with common sense.
''I decided,'' she said, ''that I would make anything I needed.''
She started with the lingerie. A flowing skirt led to a pair of pajamas. Aprons, stuffed animals, raincoats, sheets, terry cloth towels and curtains followed. She makes everything she wears save the odd pair of jeans, socks and shoes.
Ms. Beaumont likes to call her project ''Slow Clothes,'' after the Slow Food movement promoting the homegrown.
Ms. Beaumont recycles material from old items or buys fabric relatively inexpensively in Manhattan in the garment district. It usually takes her two to three weeks to finish a dress, a few hours for underwear.
Two years ago, she decided to put a label on her items, ''verysweetlife,'' with the inscription, ''Handmade in Brooklyn.'' She has yet to market that label, though she says she is ready to start. There is one nagging issue: pricing.
''How do you take something that you've spent a tremendous amount of time and effort on and put a price on it?'' she said. ''Each piece is unique. That's one thing about making everything you wear -- nobody will ever be wearing what you are wearing.''
In the meantime, Ms. Beaumont supports herself with sewing classes, for which she charges $65 to $500, depending on the length of the course, and offers private lessons as well.
Tamara Mose Brown, an assistant professor of sociology at Brooklyn College, who lives in Kensington, says Ms. Beaumont exemplifies the economic growth occurring in Brooklyn, driven by small businesses, restaurants and clothing shops. ''Brooklynites are feeling that they want to have this identity away from Manhattan and the air of consumerism,'' Professor Brown said. ''There's this element of self-preservation and economic sustainability.''
In her intimate second-floor sewing studio in Boerum Hill, outfitted with five Kenmore sewing machines and filled with rulers, patterns and dress forms, Ms. Beaumont teaches adults -- lawyers, writers, grandmothers and others -- fractions, geometry and remedial cutting in order to master patternmaking.
''It is not a sign of intelligence how hard it is to cut or measure,'' she assured three students working on a pillow pattern last month in her studio.
Harriet Clemons, 54, of Crown Heights, was taking the three-week course so she could make clothes for her grandchildren. Kate Clifford, 28, works at a SoHo knitting shop and wanted to expand her repertoire. One of her roommates in Kensington sells homemade vegan muffins.
Elizabeth Cline, 30, of Bedford-Stuyvesant, is writing a book about budget fashion and the declining price of clothing, and hoped to supplement her own wardrobe.
''It's encouraging that you can actually make things that are better or at least the level of what stores are selling,'' Ms. Cline said.
Ms. Beaumont never followed the crowd, growing up in Pittsburgh embroidering, and enjoying the meals made by her mother, a chef and a baker. She majored in English literature at Bryn Mawr College, where she rode a unicycle in leggings and a skirt.
Every day she kisses her sleek white high-tech Bernina sewing machine, next to which she has meticulously organized bobbins by color, and spools of thread. Although hers is an intense, solitary passion, it is also meditative, in sync with much of the D.I.Y. culture.
''It's hands on, getting back to the basics,'' Ms. Brown said, ''and it makes people feel that they are not falling victim to the machine.''
Unless, of course, it's a white Kenmore.
''These are adults who hold their pillows and beam, they are so proud of themselves,'' Ms. Beaumont said with a twinkle. ''That's how I feel a lot of the time. It's not ego-driven pride, but I look in the mirror and say, 'I can do this.' ''

HEADLINE: Danny Meyer on a Roll

BYLINE: By SEAN WILSEY

 BODY:
Danny Meyer scaled the subway stairs two at a time, emerged on Lexington and 77th, lengthened his stride and called over his shoulder: ''Have I told you about the Meyer Street-Crossing Method? Meyscrom.'' He scanned traffic. ''Cut off every possible angle without being killed.''
A car whipped by. Another stopped. He sliced off the last 10 feet of 75th street (''That was a baby jay'') and reached the Whitney museum, home of his newest restaurant, in two minutes.
Meyer -- 53, trim, salt-and-pepper hair -- greeted me an hour earlier in his Union Square office. It was March, and the branches outside his windows were just beginning to blur green. He stood up from behind a desk, backed by a wall of books (sample title: ''The Power of Nice''), took my hand and applied the ideal amount of pressure for the ideal amount of time: a better handshake than any I could recall. 
It was 9 a.m., and he was reviewing final edits for ''Eleven Madison Park: The Cookbook,'' a collection of recipes from his four-star restaurant. In the hall, his assistant, Haley Carroll, examined lunch reservations on a computer.
''I'm looking for notable people,'' she said. Meyer would spend from 11:30 a.m. to 2 p.m. visiting their tables. A prominent book publisher would be eating at Union Square Cafe. ''He's made 878 reservations and always sits at Table 38.'' Onscreen a note said to give him 38 unless someone named Peggy wanted it.
''Does Danny do dinner visits?'' I asked.
''He will depending on where.'' She called out, ''Danny, how often do you do dinner drop-ins?''
''Three times a week for Maialino'' -- the Roman-style trattoria across from his apartment -- ''two times a week somewhere else.''
Carroll told me: ''If there's a school play at 7:30'' -- Meyer is the father of four -- ''he can stop by the bar at 6:45 and say hello. It's all about schedule.'' To Meyer: ''Adam Moss is at Maialino tonight . . . Angie is in the Modern's Bar Room dining with Judy. They get together a couple times a year. Gramercy Tavern, Sy Sternberg is there . . . Vincent Ottomanelli, Jason Epstein for dinner. Jamie Niven.''
Carroll handed a printout to Meyer. He pointed to a name and asked, ''Doesn't she write us notes?''
''Danny caught one that I missed.''
After going over the cookbook manuscript (''They're trying to get me out of the present. . . . I don't want to be in the conditional''), Meyer made his way to the Whitney for a 10 a.m. meeting with his staff. The scheduled opening of the restaurant, named Untitled, was a week away. Meyer devotes unlimited time to his new ventures, tasting every item on the menu multiple times, suggesting alterations to such minutiae as the size of a sous chef's dice and constantly consulting with the manager. I heard him instruct Untitled's chef to alter a B.L.T. so the bacon would stick out on either side. ''That's called turning up the 'home' dial,'' he explained.
In the museum's basement, Untitled's chef, manager and three dozen waiters, waitresses, busboys, runners and line cooks sat on uncomfortable chairs. Meyer greeted them and went into a speech -- one of three he would give that day -- calibrated to inspire. (His mother, Roxanne Frank, told me of his public persona: ''That's something that has evolved as he matured. He was a little bit shy growing up.'') ''When an artist can't decide a name it's untitled,'' he told the group. ''When the name is Untitled, it's underlined. We are underlining it. . . . I thought it would be refreshing -- make of it what you want. Put it on yourself. 'I'm Untitled.' Put it on a coffee. Every coffee has a big brand on it. Wouldn't it be great if you could just serve really good food and make people happy?'' He segued into the decline of the Upper East Side coffee shop, the ascent of boutiques, the economics behind corporate entities that can afford to pay almost any rent for exposure at a particular location. ''We thought, Let's do a New York farm-to-table coffee shop. Why is it that coffee shops aren't that good with coffee? . . . When was the last time you went to a coffee shop that cured and smoked its own bacon? Right here at Untitled. We're here for you and what you want to be.''
We left and walked up to the Upper East Side branch of Shake Shack, one of his five hamburger stands in Manhattan. On Park Avenue he was recognized by a pedestrian, and briefly stopped to talk. ''Occasionally they'll see me up here, and I'm like that doorman they can't place,'' he told me.
When we reached 86th Street, Meyer asked, ''Smell it?'' I did. Shake Shack makes its first impressions olfactorily. He breathed deeply, stepped inside, stood atop a flight of stairs leading to the cash registers and slowly scanned the scene. ''My favorite thing is watching people enjoy our food,'' he told me earlier. ''I get sort of an insane amount of pleasure out of that.''
After a quick walk-through -- Meyer spotted and comped a woman he referred to as ''New York's first celebrity woman chef'' -- we stepped back outside to ponder logistics. Could we hit the Upper West Side Shake Shack, and then the Modern, his restaurant at the Museum of Modern Art, and still make Eleven Madison Park, where he was expected to address a private party, by 2 p.m.? It was 11:50 a.m. Into a cab. Through the park. Out in front of the Shack, on 77th and Columbus, where Meyer was recognized by a slender woman pushing a stroller. He greeted her without breaking eye contact, then, as she walked off, turned to me and pointed out a damaged chair through the Shack's window (''See that slat?'') that he somehow noticed without looking away from the stroller pusher. He went inside, had a brief word with the manager and descended a staircase to ''the scrum'' -- a basement dining room with a flat-screen TV, packed full of kids and nannies.
Meyer told me: ''One of my greatest moments was right here. A bunch of sixth or seventh graders were carrying their trays down. One said, 'Yeah, I guess I'm glad we're here -- I couldn't bear one more day of Chipotle.' ''
He decided to add the theater-district Shack to our itinerary. After grabbing another cab, we stopped at 44th and Eighth Avenue. ''Former Chipotle manager here,'' Meyer said with satisfaction. We entered into the Smell. Now that Meyer had pointed it out, I was struck by its tactile qualities -- the presence of more airborne grease than even the most advanced exhaust systems can dissipate. In the manager's office, pictures of a multibranch Shack outing on a booze cruise covered a bulletin board. Meyer smiled and said, ''That's what I want to see -- people goofing around and having fun.'' As we exited, the staff waved, and Meyer told me, ''This is management by walking around.''
To make it to MoMA he opted against a cab -- we'd Meyscrom through parking lots and breezeways, cheating the Manhattan grid. Midblock in a hotel atrium, he stopped, shook his head and said: ''If you can get joy out of this, life isn't so bad.''
At the Modern, Meyer pulled a silk tie out of his jacket pocket, knotted it on and made for a grand cru Chablis tasting in the private dining room. He approached a young man in a thick-napped brown suit: Romain Collet, of the Jean Collet wine dynasty. Meyer introduced himself, in French, and began detailing the long relationship between his restaurants and the family's vineyard.
Next, dining room visits: with a former neighbor from his home town, St. Louis; the chairman of the Sotheby's board (which Meyer had just joined); and a gray-blond, very attractive businesswoman who, refusing the half-hug Meyer offered while she was seated, exclaimed, ''That's not enough; I need a full-body hug,'' stood up and got it.
We took a cab to 26th and Madison, Meyer on a call all the way downtown. Then he hopped out and skirted the park, still talking into his phone while pointing out the first flowers of spring (yellow), crossed the avenue and stepped through the revolving doors of Eleven Madison Park. We walked to the back of the restaurant, passed through an upstairs kitchen where penny-size petit fours were being arranged, then into a room where a group of Tammanyesque men, the Country Club Chefs of Connecticut, had just pushed back their chairs. One stood and introduced Meyer: ''He's a man with a lot of ambition.''
Meyer delivered an effortless postprandial speech, insidery for the industry crowd, dropping the surprise that he was planning a Shake Shack for Connecticut. Huge applause.
After jaywalking across 23rd Street and making Union Square in six minutes, Meyer told me: ''This is what I do. I couldn't sit in a chair in an office all day.''
New York is a city of rooms. Most of them are tiny, dark, lonely and the wrong temperature. Meyer makes rooms that are exquisite -- overlooking, in the case of the Modern, the greatest sculptures of the 20th century -- and intimate. You feel at home. His goal, he told me, is for customers to make his restaurants their clubhouses.
Meyer's track record is near perfect: one closing (Tabla, a 283-seat Indian place that lasted for 12 years), 25 openings and counting. And for most of his career he has expanded without repeating himself. He has created new restaurants as though they were each his first and only -- the singularity of a place always as important as the food. His looseness and precision are qualities more reminiscent of an athlete or an artist. Whatever Meyer is engaged in -- jaywalking, French-speaking, grease-inhaling -- receives his complete attention.
Some of this is hereditary. Meyer's father, Morton, owned hotels and had a gift for hospitality. As Meyer told me, ''My dad gave me the gene to enjoy cooking, and to enjoy consuming good food and wine.''
After college, Meyer apprenticed in European kitchens, worked as a successful salesman (of plastic shoplifting-prevention tags) in New York, became an assistant manager at a Manhattan seafood restaurant, got to know chefs and critics and one of his future partners, and met the woman who would become his wife, Audrey Heffernan, who was working as a waitress. In 1985, he withdrew his savings and opened Union Square Cafe. Anticipating that The New York Times was going to review the place, he came down with Bell's palsy. The left half of his face was paralyzed, and the left half of his tongue lost its sense of taste. Symptoms abated after two weeks. The review was a rave. And Union Square Cafe went on to critical and popular acclaim. The natural next step was to try to repeat his success at another restaurant. But Meyer had seen his father overextend and fail. Morton Meyer was in the travel-tour business before jumping into owning two hotels -- in Rome and Milan -- and spending much of his life on an airplane. Unable to balance ambition and finances, the elder Meyer went bankrupt at 42, destroyed his marriage, went bankrupt again and died at 59, when Danny was 32. Meyer told me his father's notions of hospitality were always ''right on the money,'' but his weakness was ''business disciplines'' and ''team-building.''
The son has managed every aspect of his career to avoid repeating the mistakes of the father. It would be nine years before his second restaurant, Gramercy Tavern, opened. Other restaurants followed, approximately one every four years, each requiring vast investments of time to meet his standards. It has taken Meyer 26 years to go from the owner-manager of a single place to C.E.O. of a company -- Union Square Hospitality Group -- that employs 2,200 people and oversees the operations of all his restaurants. His mother calls the company ''his business family.'' Its core is a tight-knit group of five general partners whom Meyer has known for an aggregate of 102 years. Together they oversee three places that are in the Zagat Guide's Top 5 (Gramercy Tavern, Eleven Madison Park, Union Square Cafe), plus the Modern, Maialino, Blue Smoke, the two cafes at the Museum of Modern Art, the newly opened restaurant at the Whitney, a jazz club, a handful of seasonal stands including one at Citi Field and a catering and events company. Meyer is on the board of Open Table, the Internet restaurant reservations service that not only allows him to materialize midlunch for a full-body hug but also tracks the eating habits of his 3,500 or so fine-dining customers each day. (Shake Shack feeds more than 12,000 daily.) This has all taken decades. And Meyer might have remained an incrementalist were it not for Shake Shack, which began as a hot-dog cart that he told the staff of Eleven Madison to set up in the park across the street in 2001. The cart was such a sensation that he expanded the menu to include burgers and milkshakes and opened an actual 400-square-foot shack in the park in 2004. Eleven Madison owned Shake Shack from 2004 to 2009, when it became its own company -- but the mobbed burger stand provided the capital required to hire the Swiss chef Daniel Humm away from a restaurant in San Francisco, reduce the seats in his new dining room, double his staff and establish a venue so elevated in its pursuits that it's less a restaurant than a graduate program in taste. Four stars from The Times ultimately followed.
Shake Shack began spreading throughout Manhattan in 2008, along the Eastern Seaboard in 2010 and 2011 (Miami and Washington) and now overseas, with branches newly opened in Dubai and Kuwait City. The total number of Shake Shacks now stands at 13 -- in three years, Meyer has doubled his restaurant holdings.
In ''Setting the Table,'' his memoir cum manifesto on hospitality, published just after Shake Shack opened, Meyer describes his mood upon opening restaurant No. 2, Gramercy Tavern: ''I had the sense of being close to a dangerous outcome. Was I now treading down the same path my father had taken -- expansion to bankruptcy?''
These fears have been definitively put to rest, and Meyer has embraced what he described to me as ''the profitability edge'' of Shake Shack -- an edge that is sharpened by volume and expansion, in contrast to the world of white tablecloths. According to the National Restaurant Association, profit margins in ''full service'' restaurants, with an average check of $25 or more per person, range from -2 percent to 6.8 percent, with a median of 1.8 percent. Meyer, having perfected fine dining, may only just be beating 30-year Treasurys. Shake Shack changes that, with margins in its category, ''limited service,'' as high as 13 percent. Of course, odds are that Meyer is beating all these markers. But for the first time in his career, Meyer finds it impossible to visit all his restaurants in a single day. Ubiquity and hands-on attention -- essential to his success -- are incompatible with expansion.
Union Square Hospitality Group has begun to produce some Shake Shack ingredients in a Louisiana factory (instead of in an auxiliary kitchen at Eleven Madison Park). In the walk-in fridge of one branch, I handled a gigantic plastic pillow of cheese sauce: designed to travel. A day earlier I wondered about a sticker on a bag Meyer was carrying: MSY, the New Orleans airport code. I imagined him flying in, sniffing the cheese vat, recalibrating machinery. It was a reassuring vision. But I had to wonder if Meyer -- without being present to indulge customers, tweak recipes and notice every broken chair -- can perpetuate the dining experience that is expected of him. Later I walked past Union Square Cafe and saw that it had been given a Health Department grade of ''B,'' indicating 14 to 27 sanitary violation points. (It now has an ''A.'') In a non-Meyer place this would barely be worth noting. But how can Union Square Cafe and his other inimitable restaurants preserve their essence without constant infusions of Meyerness?
This past winter, in Miami, Meyer participated in a mass grill-off called Burger Bash. Shake Shack, past winner of the event's People's Choice award, was a returning champion. Meyer opened a Miami Shack in 2010, and he wanted to use this trip to scout for a second location -- with a management group in place, he needed to give it more to do.
In South Beach, under a huge oceanside tent, American celebrity chefery was prepping to sear hecatombs of flesh. There for the weekend were Bobby Flay, Rachael Ray, Emeril Lagasse, Martha Stewart, Anthony Bourdain, Giada De Laurentiis -- the gods and demigods of an industry that generates an estimated $1.7 trillion.
Shake Shack would produce a few thousand burgers and chorizo cheese fries. As we dodged front-end loaders and harried interns, Meyer took a call and said, ''I'm walking the grounds of Burger Bash the way they take a racehorse to the paddock before the race.''
Shake Shack competes with ''better burger'' chains -- Five Guys, In-N-Out, etc. But the scale and execution are different. Those chains have hundreds of locations and exponential expansion plans. In-N-Out operates two meat-processing plants. Meyer told me the vast majority of Shake Shack's management ''began their careers with us in our fine-dining restaurants,'' and the meat comes from Pat LaFrieda, a third-generation butcher who produces a blend of sirloin, chuck and brisket designed by Richard Coraine, former general manager of Wolfgang Puck's Postrio in San Francisco and now one of Meyer's partners. As Meyer put it: ''There are a zillion variables to a hamburger. What part of the animal went into it. What coarseness. What temperature.'' Coraine spent months ''tasting and modifying the blend to hit the right chord.'' Coraine explained the details in an e-mail: ''You can also factor a few other elements . . . the amount of butter brushed on the bun before griddling it (there is fat in butter, so the brisket was taken down a level) the composition and amount of 'Shack Sauce' (flavor in there as well) and the type and 'slice width' of the American cheese.''
The critic Oliver Strand told me -- hyperbole be damned -- that the meat was ''every bit as excellent as what you'll find in Peter Luger's or Keens's.'' Beyond the exalted flesh, the Shake Shack aesthetic is unintimidatingly midcentury, the marketing is cheeky (if you want cucumber, tomato and relish on your hot dog, the kitchen will ''drag it through the garden'') and each branch supports a local charity.
At the Shake Shack booth I was introduced to one of Meyer's partners in Union Square Hospitality, David Swinghamer, a straw-haired Wisconsinite so tall he stooped. Swinghamer fed me a Shack burger: cooked-through, barely a suggestion of pink at the center, as they are in every Shack. Then I sneaked off to Umami Burger, a five-unit Southern California chain coming to Miami in 2012. The competition. Umami's meat was capped with a mushroom, but it was raw on the inside. I got a sample for Meyer. He and Swinghamer devoured it, communally -- ripping it apart with their hands.
Meyer, mouth full, declared, ''It's not cooked, but the beef is mighty good.''
Swinghamer: ''I like the shiitake.''
Me: ''Maybe I should tell them the meat's not cooked.''
Meyer, solemnly: ''If they asked, I would tell them. But as Napoleon said, 'Part of brilliance is winning and part is leaving your opponent alone when he's losing.' ''
A line formed for Shake Shack burgers. A Frenchman jostled up to say: ''Hi, Danny. You look great.''
Meyer said: ''Laurent. You left Chicago. You got your Michelin stars and -- '' He pantomimed a goodbye wave then handed him a burger.
The Frenchman devoured it.
After he'd gone, Meyer said: ''Laurent Gras. Incredible chef. Three Michelin stars.''
An 11-person band started cranking out covers. A man hollered at Meyer: ''I e-mailed you! We met a couple years ago!'' Then he was swallowed up by the crowd.
I took a walk and came upon Bobby Flay, standing in a cloud of smoke surrounded by young women in ''Get Crunchified'' T-shirts, all screaming to INXS's ''What You Need,'' while fans' camera flashes lighted up billowing explosions from the grill. I got a burger and brought it back to Shake Shack.
Meyer grabbed Swinghamer, and we all withdrew to a stainless prep table.
Regarding the offering, Meyer said, ''This is Bobby Flay.''
A dissection ensued. He removed the top bun. Something white jiggled to the bass line.
''Is that an egg?'' Swinghamer asked.
''Goat cheese,'' Meyer said.
He broke it up and began to eat.
''It's good,'' he conceded.
Then, with a vulnerable gleam in his eye, Meyer asked, ''How long is their line compared to ours?''
At the end of the night, Meyer left the tent and sat down, wearily, on the boardwalk. ''There were some slimy people there,'' he said. ''Just picking at me. Pick, pick, pick! . . . 'I e-mailed you.' What kind of greeting is that?'' He continued: ''I can't believe how many people tried to get me to sign a lease in Las Vegas. We're the only ones who haven't gone into Vegas yet.''
Most of these people want to recreate one of Meyer's marquee restaurants in a casino. In an e-mail later, Meyer provided three reasons that this won't happen:
1) ''I . . . cannot imagine spending my life in an airplane for the purpose of visiting a fine-dining restaurant. . . . Saw my dad try that . . . and saw a very unhappy family outcome.''
2) The impossibility of bonding with customers in a city ''built upon so much transiency.''
3) Chemical sensitivity: ''I actually have a bad reaction to . . . the synthetic deodorizers they pump through to eliminate smoke. Really, those smells almost sicken me.''
But he'll leave the door open for Shake Shack: ''We never know who's eating there day-to-day anyway,'' Meyer wrote in an e-mail. ''There's no reservation sheet to scour; no dining room to host.'' In an interview with Business Insider, he said: ''Think about a business where each one does not have a chef, or a pastry chef, or a dining-room manager, or a maitre d', or a florist, or a linen company, and you start to notice that a lot of the cost structure that goes into a fine-dining restaurant is missing. . . . From a cost-structure standpoint, it's a good way to go.''
Swinghamer found Meyer on the boardwalk and invited us to join Dan Tavan, general manager of the Miami Shake Shack, for drinks at a Japanese gastropub.
Over sake, Meyer asked Tavan, ''What was tonight, six in sales?''
''Nine, almost nine.''
A $9,000 dinner rush. Everyone drank to that.
The next morning, Meyer, Swinghamer and I drove to Shake Shack, which is in a Herzog and de Meuron-designed building, just off a pedestrian mall (Meyer sniffed and said, sadly, ''It smells different before it opens''), then on to south Miami to scout for a new location. As we crossed Biscayne Bay, Meyer admired the palm-covered islands, with their 1920s architecture. But as the traffic got thicker and the buildings blander, he said: ''This strip is so antiseptic. Needs to be cool. '' Then, ''This whole area just gets me nervous.''
Of the 13 Shake Shacks, a majority are in parks or areas with lots of pedestrian traffic. Such locations create a boutique quality Meyer calls ''Shackness.''
Credit here goes to Swinghamer, who Meyer told me has a ''sixth sense'' for real estate. ''The ideal doesn't just come up for rent,'' Swinghamer said. ''You need to have inside knowledge. People on the ground.'' He explained that they had ''inside information about the place we're going.'' He added, ''It's not on the market yet, so nobody else really knows about it.''
We were following a commuter rail line, boxed in by strip malls. As we passed a corner Chipotle, Swinghamer said, ''Reliable sources say they do $2.7 million there.'' Pause. ''We do a lot more business than a typical Chipotle.'' He looked hard at the corner. ''Gotta do a lot . . . and be in a place that expresses Shackness.''
Meyer was only getting more nervous. Financial upsides aside, he seemed unable to tune out the surroundings. ''It's a sea of dreck,'' he said, and began reading the names of businesses: ''Puritan Cleaners. Hookah Lounge.''
''Meyer Mortgage,'' I pointed out.
''Saw that -- I'm looking for signs.''
We arrived at the place they'd been tipped to: a barbecue joint with good parking, straddling the highway and a bland residential district, within walking distance of the University of Miami.
''Can this be a Shack?' Meyer asked.
Contemplative silence.
''I see something looking back real far to the iconic hamburger/hot-dog stands,'' Swinghamer said. ''We'll put our modern twist to it.''
''Modern retro,'' Meyer said.
They began refining a concept. Every Shake Shack is nominally tailored to its presumptive clientele: the TV room for kids and nannies on Manhattan's Upper West Side, communal seating for tourists in the theater district, site-specific ''concretes'' (frozen custards with various mix-ins), like the vanilla, fudge sauce, peanut and shattered-sugar-cone ''Nut-Thing but Amazin' '' for Mets fans at Citi Field.
Here the clientele would be undergrads. ''Should have a lot of TVs, and ultra-cool music so the students come over,'' Swinghamer said. ''This is an alternative to going to a bar.''
''You'd want some neon that said something about ice-cold beer,'' Meyer said.
''Yeah,'' Swinghamer said. ''A touch of a roadhouse. That would work for college.''
''I like the tree,'' said Meyer, indicating a banyan up against the building. We pulled alongside, and Swinghamer lowered the windows.
Meyer mused, ''We could name a concrete after it.''
For years the question of how to expand has been something Meyer struggled with. Then he met Susan Reilly Salgado, a doctoral candidate in business at New York University. She'd been eating at the bar at Union Square Cafe, getting to know the staff, listening to waiters say things like, ''When I found this job, I felt like I'd come home.'' In 1998 she saw Meyer ''working the room'' on the opening night at Tabla, introduced herself and said she wanted to do her dissertation on his restaurants. He agreed, provided she work as a hostess for six months.
Five years later she informed Meyer that his company was too dependent on him. ''There's no system for opening restaurants without you,'' she said, ''and the more you open, the more diluted your impact becomes.'' Salgado proposed forming a curriculum ''to make explicit everything that Danny . . . intuitively knew.'' Practically speaking, this would allow for succession (part of avoiding his father's mistakes is ensuring the business can continue without him) and, in the shorter term, for the company to open new restaurants not just in Miami but anywhere in the world.
Meyer has often been approached with the idea of franchising Shake Shack in the United States, which he has never wanted to do -- ''How can you franchise hospitality?'' But in 2008, after Shake Shack opened its second branch, an international franchiser, Alshaya, approached him. They operated Starbucks, Estee Lauder, Dean & DeLuca, Pinkberry and H&M outlets in the Middle East. Meyer, flattered by the interest, went to Dubai, noted that Alshaya's Starbucks were ''as well run if not better than the ones on Union Square''; he told Business Insider he decided to ''get a master's degree in replication . . . but so far away that our audience wouldn't watch us doing it, and at the same time give us a chance to grow.'' Shake Shacks in Dubai and Kuwait are the first phase.
Salgado now leads a new company, incorporated last year under the name Hospitality Quotient (H.Q.), that franchises not food but Meyer's style -- franchises, in effect, his eye contact, handshaking, infectious capacity for pleasure. As Meyer put it, hospitality is ''the degree to which it makes you feel good to make other people feel good.''
Salgado told me of Meyer's feelgood style, ''We decided the model was sustainable, the concepts transferable.'' And many were the companies that could benefit.
The abbreviation comes from Meyer. As he put it, an I.Q. is native and can't be taught; so, too, is an H.Q. ''But it can be identified. . . . Someone with a high H.Q. is at their best when providing happiness to someone else.'' And with H.Q., ''we're working with companies that . . . want to be the best in the world at how people feel.'' To this end they've trained staff at Beth Israel (''A hospital should be hospitable,'' the head of orthopedics told Meyer), a Broadway theater company and a supermarket chain.
Alshaya's management teams for Dubai and Kuwait came to New York for a sort of kindness boot camp, months before opening. Then Meyer sent a group of his high-H.Q. staff members to Dubai and Kuwait for on-site training.
The businesses that Alshaya franchises are the exact sorts H.Q. hopes to work with. Should all proceed as planned, the profitability edge will be unbluntable.
Floyd Cardoz, the chef of Tabla, which closed last year, was waiting in Meyer's office on a clear March afternoon. The decision to shutter Tabla was, Meyer told me, ''excruciatingly hard.'' He resisted for years, losing money, laying people off for the first time in his career.
''I always genuinely believed we could turn Tabla's fortunes around,'' he told me in an e-mail. ''I was hanging on to the false pride of being able to say we had never closed a restaurant in our first quarter-century of doing business.'' He continued, ''But I was ultimately convinced by my partners that -- counterintuitively -- the cruelest thing we could do for people's careers was to keep it going.''
Now Meyer and Cardoz embraced. A new tenant had just taken over the Tabla lease, and the chef said, slowly, ''I have a lump in my throat. . . . I handed my keys over today.'' Tears were in his eyes. Meyer's too. ''It was a very good 12 years,'' Cardoz said. ''I learned a lot about myself. I don't know what the outcome was.''
''It was good, Floyd,'' Meyer said. ''You'd like to think that a restaurant will go on forever, like you think your life will go on forever.''
Soon they began to leaf through a stack of menus from the '20s and '30s (Meyer has a collection), looking for ideas for a new Battery Park City restaurant that U.S.H.G had just announced. It would serve seafood and grow its own vegetables. Cardoz would be in the kitchen.
Meyer mentioned that the shrimp at Blue Hill, where he ate for his birthday the night before, were cooked on hibachis, with charcoal made from the bones of animals raised on an upstate farm affiliated with the restaurant.
''That's a gimmick kind of thing -- it's not going to flavor the food,'' Cardoz said.
Meyer countered that it was smart recycling and good marketing.
Cardoz: ''Lot of carbon emissions making charcoal. Not that green.''
Meyer ended the argument by pointing out that the farm used the emissions to heat its greenhouse. (He turned out to be wrong; the farm used the heat generated by composting.)
They started debating what they'd serve at the new place. Cardoz had been to the Oyster Bar at Grand Central: ''Bad food for high prices, paper cups for sauce and full of people.''
Meyer leafed through his menus.
Cardoz: ''A whole section on eggs.''
Meyer: ''Anchovies on toast. How long ago was this? Broiled lobster, $2.50.'' He pointed -- 1939.
''Vegetables are an important part of this restaurant,'' Meyer continued. ''What if vegetables were the main course? Not just to keep vegetarians happy, but to make the restaurant a destination.''
Cardoz was jotting down menu categories. ''Lose 'sides' and call it 'vegetables,' '' he said.
They moved on to seafood.
Meyer said: ''It's become totally cliche to have a big platter of raw stuff. . . . At the Oyster Bar, how many oysters were there, 20?''
''And the waiter didn't even know what they were,'' Cardoz said.
''I want to have the best oyster you can have in New York today, opened perfectly.''
Half an hour later Cardoz got up to go.
Meyer said, ''Peace be with you, baby.'' It was time for dinner.

THE PIRATES OF SOMALIA
Inside Their Hidden World
By Jay Bahadur
Illustrated. 300 pp. Pantheon Books. $26.95.
On April 8, 2009, the Maersk Alabama, a 17,000-ton United States cargo vessel, was hijacked by four Somali pirates several hundred miles east of Mogadishu. Bobbing in a lifeboat with the skipper, 53-year-old Richard Phillips, they began negotiating with the ship's owners via cellphone for a multimillion-dollar ransom. For five days, the pirates and their hostage drifted in the Indian Ocean, shadowed by the U.S.S. Bainbridge, a destroyer that arrived at the scene not long after the hijacking. At dusk on April 12, Navy snipers killed three of the Somalis, and Phillips was rescued unharmed. The surviving pirate was seized and taken to the United States, where he pleaded guilty in a Manhattan courtroom to a host of charges and was sentenced to 33 years and nine months in a federal prison. 
The hijacking of the Alabama, the first seizure of an American-flagged vessel in 200 years, drew the country's attention to the return of a scourge once associated with plank-walks, treasure chests and peg-legged marauders. But, as Jay Bahadur makes clear in ''The Pirates of Somalia,'' buccaneering has evolved into a very modern activity, complete with night vision goggles, GPS units and even investment advisers.
In the fall of 2008, Bahadur, a young Canadian, quit his job writing market-research reports in Chicago and flew in an aging Russian Antonov to Puntland, a breakaway region of northeastern Somalia that has become, as he puts it, ''the epicenter'' of the piracy business. Braving the constant threat of kidnapping, he ingratiated himself with pirate bosses and their crews and made a risky trip through the desert to Eyl, the remote enclave where present-day Somali piracy was born.
Bahadur has gone deep in exploring the causes of this seaborne crime wave, charting its explosive growth and humanizing the brigands who have eluded some of the world's most powerful navies. The way Bahadur tells it, the piracy industry gained force in the 1990s, after the outbreak of Somalia's civil war. The first targets, commercial lobster-fishing vessels, were trawling off the coast of Puntland. Because they used steel-pronged drag fishing nets, Bahadur explains, ''these foreign trawlers did not bother with nimble explorations of the reefs.'' Instead, ''they uprooted them, netting the future livelihoods of the nearby coastal people along with the days' catch.'' A small group of aggrieved fishermen, led by a pirate called Boyah (whom Bahadur interviewed at a farm near the flyblown Puntland capital, Garowe) began capturing the trawlers and holding the crews for ransom. But after the commercial fishermen cut deals with southern warlords for protection, Boyah and his fellow pirates switched tactics, indiscriminately assaulting vessels that sailed into the vicinity of Eyl.
As Somali piracy increased, resourceful characters like Mohamed Abdi Hassan, known as Afweyne (''Big Mouth''), from the central coastal town of Harardheere, brought a new sophistication to the business. Afweyne raised venture capital for his pirate operations, Bahadur writes, ''as if he were launching a Wall Street I.P.O.'' Criminal gangs like his became highly organized, and the deployment of ''motherships'' allowed them to operate hundreds of miles from the coast.
When a radical fundamentalist movement called the Islamic Courts Union seized control of the southern half of Somalia in 2006 and declared war on pirates in its territory, the Puntland operations gained unchallenged supremacy. And dodgy coast guard outfits hired by the Puntland government inadvertently provided on-the-job training to aspiring pirates, familiarizing them with sophisticated weapons, assault tactics and advanced navigation systems. In 2009, Puntland's newly elected president, Abdirahman Farole, a low-key former professor who seemed, Bahadur says, to abhor the pirates, ended the laissez-faire policies of his predecessors. But while he authorized the arrest and imprisonment of pirates, Farole has proven unwilling to attack their bases. To do so would risk plunging clan-fractured Puntland into civil war.
It wasn't until October 2008 -- when NATO, the European Union and the United States committed significant naval forces to patrol the main shipping route -- that the international community began to respond. The Internationally Recommended Transit Corridor, a heavily patrolled safety zone, now runs for about 400 miles along the Yemeni side of the Gulf of Aden. Yet lumbering destroyers are often no match for small groups of marauders in nimble skiffs. ''Hunting pirates,'' Bahadur remarks, ''must seem like playing a losing game of Whac-a-Mole.'' Moreover, what the pirates sometimes lack in technology and firepower, they have compensated for in adaptability. After Western nations began positioning naval vessels outside key harbors, the pirates simply tied their skiffs to the backs of 44s and set sail from remote beaches.
The payment of seven-figure ransoms, an inexhaustible supply of unemployed young men, a highly romanticized pirate culture and continued Somali chaos have undermined efforts at interdiction. From 2008 to 2010, Bahadur reports, the number of attacks nearly doubled, with only a small drop in the rate of success.
Bahadur captures the inner workings of Somali piracy in extraordinary detail. The organizational structure of typical pirate cells, he explains, includes not just attackers, interpreters, accountants and cooks: almost every group also has its supplier of khat, a plant flown into Somalia by the ton every day from Kenya and Ethiopia and chewed for an addictive high. Like low-level urban crack dealers, the pirates at the bottom rung of the hierarchy make barely enough to survive. But, high or low, these brigands practice some peculiar rituals. After receiving his cut of the ransom on the captured ship, one pirate tells Bahadur, each man must toss his mobile phone into the ocean -- a precaution to make sure no one can call ahead to his kin to arrange an ambush of his fellow cell members.
Bahadur seems to admire the pirates' audacity and resourcefulness, yet at the same time he avoids glamorizing them. If the first wave of Somali pirates consisted mostly of ''fishermen vigilantes,'' Bahadur writes, the new generation is far more cynical, exuding ''cold ruthlessness'' and demonstrating a proclivity for torture and violence.
Not all of Bahadur's encounters are edifying. There are too many long-/winded conversations with desperadoes who present the same tiresome self-/justifications (they were pushed into their crimes because of abuses carried out by commercial fishing vessels) and the same dubious assertions that piracy would disappear if illegal fishing were halted. A lengthy excursion to meet low-level pirates in a maximum security prison in Kenya -- a dumping ground for outlaws captured in international waters -- doesn't add much to the narrative.
But the book ends with a flourish, with Bahadur's account of his road trip to Eyl, a hellhole by the sea where swaggering young pirates lord over a cowed population. Sitting immobilized in the harbor is the MV Victoria, a German freighter hijacked while transporting rice to the Saudi Arabian port of Jeddah. For the captive crew, weeks of boredom and terror end the way such episodes usually do, in this case with a $1.8 million ransom dropped by parachute. A solution to the scourge of Somali piracy, as Bahadur's brave and exhaustively reported book makes clear, won't fall into place so easily.
Correction: August 28, 2011, Sunday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: A review on Aug. 7 about ''The Pirates of Somalia,'' by Jay Bahadur, attributed an erroneous distinction to the hijacking of the United States cargo ship Maersk Alabama by Somali pirates in 2009. It was one of several -- not the first -- American-flagged vessels to be seized within 200 years. (At least two other such incidents preceded the Maersk Alabama one. In 1968, North Korean forces seized the U.S.S. Pueblo, a Navy intelligence-gathering ship, and in 1975, the Khmer Rouge regime in Cambodia seized the United States merchant ship Mayaguez.)

HEADLINE: U.S. Widens Its Role in Battle Against Mexico's Drug Cartels

BYLINE: By GINGER THOMPSON; Eric Schmitt contributed reporting.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The United States is expanding its role in Mexico's bloody fight against drug trafficking organizations, sending newC.I.A. operatives and retired military personnel to the country and considering plans to deploy private security contractors in hopes of turning around a multibillion-dollar effort that so far has shown few results.
In recent weeks, small numbers of C.I.A. operatives and American civilian military employees have been posted at a Mexican military base, where, for the first time, security officials from both countries work side by side in collecting information about drug cartels and helping plan operations. Officials are also looking into embedding a team of American contractors inside a specially vetted Mexican counternarcotics police unit.
Officials on both sides of the border say the new efforts have been devised to get around Mexican laws that prohibit foreign military and police from operating on its soil, and to prevent advanced American surveillance technology from falling under the control of Mexican security agencies with long histories of corruption. 
''A sea change has occurred over the past years in how effective Mexico and U.S. intelligence exchanges have become,'' said Arturo Sarukhan, Mexico's ambassador to the United States. ''It is underpinned by the understanding that transnational organized crime can only be successfully confronted by working hand in hand, and that the outcome is as simple as it is compelling: we will together succeed or together fail.''
The latest steps come three years after the United States began increasing its security assistance to Mexico with the $1.4 billion Merida Initiative and tens of millions of dollars from the Defense Department. They also come a year before elections in both countries, when President Obama may confront questions about the threat of violence spilling over the border, and President Felipe Calderon's political party faces a Mexican electorate that is almost certainly going to ask why it should stick with a fight that has left nearly 45,000 people dead.
''The pressure is going to be especially strong in Mexico, where I expect there will be a lot more raids, a lot more arrests and a lot more parading drug traffickers in front of cameras,'' said Vanda Felbab-Brown, a counternarcotics expert at the Brookings Institution. ''But I would also expect a lot of questioning of Merida, and some people asking about the way the money is spent, or demanding that the government send it back to the gringos.''
Mexico has become ground zero in the American counternarcotics fight since its cartels have cornered the market and are responsible for more than 80 percent of the drugs that enter the United States. American counternarcotics assistance there has grown faster in recent years than to Afghanistan and Colombia. And in the last three years, officials said, exchanges of intelligence between the United States and Mexico have helped security forces there capture or kill some 30 mid- to high-level drug traffickers, compared with just two such arrests in the previous five years.
The United States has trained nearly 4,500 new federal police agents and assisted in conducting wiretaps, running informants and interrogating suspects. The Pentagon has provided sophisticated equipment, including Black Hawk helicopters, and in recent months it has begun flying unarmed surveillance drones over Mexican soil to track drug kingpins.
Still, it is hard to say much real progress has been made in crippling the brutal cartels or stemming the flow of drugs and guns across the border. Mexico's justice system remains so weakened by corruption that even the most notorious criminals have not been successfully prosecuted.
''The government has argued that the number of deaths in Mexico is proof positive that the strategy is working and that the cartels are being weakened,'' said Nik Steinberg, a specialist on Mexico at Human Rights Watch. ''But the data is indisputable -- the violence is increasing, human rights abuses have skyrocketed and accountability both for officials who commit abuses and alleged criminals is at rock bottom.''
Mexican and American officials involved in the fight against organized crime do not see it that way. They say the efforts begun under President Obama are only a few years old, and that it is too soon for final judgments. Dan Restrepo, Mr. Obama's senior Latin American adviser, refused to talk about operational changes in the security relationship, but said, ''I think we are in a fundamentally different place than we were three years ago.''
A senior Mexican official, speaking on condition of anonymity, agreed. ''This is the game-changer in degrading transnational organized crime,'' he said, adding: ''It can't be a two-, three-, four-, five- or six-year policy. For this policy investment to work, it has to be sustained long-term.''
Several Mexican and American security analysts compared the challenges of helping Mexico rebuild its security forces and civil institutions -- crippled by more than seven decades under authoritarian rule -- to similar tests in Afghanistan. They see the United States fighting alongside a partner it needs but does not completely trust.
Though the new United States ambassador to Mexico was plucked from an assignment in Kabul, Afghanistan, the Obama administration bristles at such comparisons, saying Mexico's growing economy and functioning, though fragile, institutions put it far ahead of Afghanistan. Instead, administration officials more frequently compare Mexico's struggle to the one Colombia began some 15 years ago.
Among the most important lessons they have learned, they say, is that in almost any fight against organized crime, things tend to get worse before they get better.
When violence spiked last year around Mexico's industrial capital, Monterrey, Mr. Calderon's government asked the United States for more access to sophisticated surveillance technology and expertise. After months of negotiations, the United States established an intelligence post on a northern Mexican military base, moving Washington beyond its traditional role of sharing information to being more directly involved in gathering it.
American officials declined to provide details about the work being done by the American team of fewer than two dozen Drug Enforcement Administration agents, C.I.A. officials and retired military personnel members from the Pentagon's Northern Command. For security reasons, they asked The New York Times not to disclose the location of the compound.
But the officials said the compound had been modeled after ''fusion intelligence centers'' that the United States operates in Iraq and Afghanistan to monitor insurgent groups, and that the United States would strictly play a supporting role.
''The Mexicans are in charge,'' said one American military official. ''It's their show. We're all about technical support.''
The two countries have worked in lock step on numerous high-profile operations, including the continuing investigation of the February murder of Jaime J. Zapata, an American Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent.
Mexico's federal police chief, Genaro Garcia Luna, put a helicopter in the air within five minutes after receiving a call for help from Mr. Zapata's partner, the authorities said. Then he invited American officials to the police intelligence center -- an underground location known as ''the bunker'' -- to work directly with Mexican security forces in tracking down the suspects.
Mexican officials hand-carried shell casings recovered from the scene of the shooting to Washington for forensics tests, allowed American officials to conduct their own autopsy of the agent's body and shipped the agent's bullet-battered car to the United States for inspection.
In another operation last week, the Drug Enforcement Administration and a Mexican counternarcotics police unit collaborated on an operation that led to the arrest of Jose Antonio Hernandez Acosta, a suspected drug trafficker. The authorities believe he is responsible for hundreds of deaths in the border city of Ciudad Juarez, Mexico, including the murders of two Americans employed at the United States Consulate there.
While D.E.A. field officers were not on the scene -- the Mexicans still draw the line at that -- the Americans helped develop tips and were in contact with the Mexican unit almost every minute of the five-hour manhunt, according to a senior American official in Mexico. The unit, of about 50 officers, is the focus of another potentially ground-breaking plan that has not yet won approval. Several former D.E.A. officials said the two countries were considering a proposal to embed a group of private security contractors -- including retired D.E.A. agents and former Special Forces officers -- inside the unit to conduct an on-the-job training academy that would offer guidance in conducting operations so that suspects can be successfully taken to court. Mexican prosecutors would also work with the unit, the Americans said.
But a former American law enforcement official familiar with the unit described it as one good apple in a barrel of bad ones. He said it was based on a compound with dozens of other nonvetted officers, who provided a window on the challenges that the Mexican police continue to face.
Some of the officers had not been issued weapons, and those who had guns had not been properly trained to use them. They were required to pay for their helmets and bulletproof vests out of their own pockets. And during an intense gun battle against one of Mexico's most vicious cartels, they had to communicate with one another on their cellphones because they had not been issued police radios. ''It's sort of shocking,'' said Eric Olson of the Woodrow Wilson Center. ''Mexico is just now learning how to fight crime in the midst of a major crime wave. It's like trying to saddle your horse while running the Kentucky Derby.''

HEADLINE: Pilfered Peppers In City Gardens; Tomatoes, Too

BYLINE: By ROBIN FINN

 BODY:
AT the 700 community gardens sprinkled through the city like little Edens, the first commandment should be obvious: Thou shalt not covet, much less steal, thy neighbor's tomatoes, cucumbers or peppers. But people do.
''This was an inside job,'' Holland Haiis-Aguirre, a key-holder at the West Side Community Garden, said after she arrived at her plot on July 24 to pick a ''big, beautiful, full-sized cucumber'' that she and her husband had tended from infancy. Instead, she found a denuded vine; her prize cuke apparently was in someone else's salad. ''So frustrating,'' she wailed.
By midsummer, the urban irritant of garden pilferage was in full bloom, right in sync with the crops, the heat and the mosquitoes. 
On a recent evening, Jackie Bukowski, president of the West Side garden, was batting away biting insects while talking about the thefts from the garden, which has 87 vegetable plots under cultivation. She recalled her disbelief last summer when hundreds of ripe figs were looted overnight. ''Every single one of them, gone,'' she said, noting that the two plum trees at the garden, on 89th Street between Amsterdam and Columbus Avenues, yield fruit ''for the taking'' by neighborhood children, ''not to encourage stealing, but to help city kids learn where their food comes from.''
In the 1970s, there were far fewer community gardens in New York City. The number swelled beyond 1,000 after the parks department's GreenThumb program was established in 1978. After a falloff in the 1990s, it is now on the rebound. GreenThumb currently offers stewardship and supplies for some 600 community gardens, and the New York Restoration Project oversees 52 others. Two-year waiting lists for plots are not uncommon as the interest in organic, locally grown food has exploded.
But to hear urban farmers speak, no borough, and no garden devoted to edibles, whether sprawling or thimble-size, is immune to theft. ''Food is more attractive than flowers, especially in this economy,'' said Marjorie J. Clarke, a caretaker at the flowers-only Riverside-Inwood Neighborhood Garden, known as RING.
On the Upper West Side, cucumbers are tops for filching; in Harlem, the main draws are chilies and herbs; on the Lower East Side, green and red peppers; in Brooklyn and Queens, tomatoes and squash. But then, ''tomatoes are universally enticing,'' Ms. Bukowski said.
''Tomato theft has probably been going on since the first farmer planted the first tomato,'' she said.
In early July, Gay Snyder, a first-timer at the Floyd Bennett Gardens Association in Brooklyn at the Gateway National Recreation Area, noticed that two of her tomatoes were turning as fiery red as a summer sunset.
On July 12, after she roped in another newcomer, Barbara Pearson, to witness her debut harvest, astonishment replaced anticipation. The red tomatoes had vanished; only green ones were left. ''Crop theft season at F.B.G.A. has officially begun,'' Ms. Pearson observed.
Ms. Snyder has added a lock to her gate. ''It's such a shame,'' she said. ''One of the things I enjoy about the garden is the feeling of peace and freedom and security, the ability to get away from crime and crowds. Losing my tomatoes dampened that dream a bit.''
Adriann Musson, the president of the Floyd Bennett Gardens Association, said there were no locks or fences when she began gardening there 19 years ago. ''We separated our gardens with string,'' she said. Not anymore. ''For some reason,'' she said, ''people don't seem to consider taking veggies and flowers stealing.''
Some culprits are outsiders, like a woman who drove up in a van, took out a hand shovel, and began digging up lilies until Ms. Musson intervened. Some thieves are garden members who pounce on super-ripe produce. Their explanation is that they are taking it lest it rot.
Joanie Freedom, a founder in 1983 of the Sixth Street and Avenue B Community Garden, a busy place with 85 plots, said theft was a given. This summer the pepper crop is under tight surveillance.
''Last August someone stole every pepper in the garden,'' Ms. Freedom recounted. ''We've lost not only ripe veggies but whole plants and garden ornaments to these folks who want to take an easy way around growing their own. I caught a woman taking all of our honeysuckle blossoms because it was cheaper than buying them in Chinatown.''
Sally Young shrouds her 18 heirloom tomato plants in bird netting, but it is not birds she is trying to outwit. Claude Bastide, who grows aromatic herbs, had his spearmint and rosemary plants stolen early in the season. He responded with a sign: ''Dear Plant Thief: If I catch you stealing my plants, I will boil you alive in a cauldron filled with poison ivy and stinging nettles until your flesh falls off your bones!''
The wording caused an intramural stir. Some gardeners found the sign hilarious, but others thought it overly aggressive. ''No one should lose sleep over that sign,'' said Mr. Bastide, whose herbs have gone unmolested since he put it up. ''I know I don't lose sleep over the loss of some of my plants. It's just a big-city annoyance that one has to shrug off.''
Garden theft is by no means unique to New York. In 2007, David Tracey, a Vancouver journalist and environmental designer, published ''Guerrilla Gardening, a Manualfesto.'' Tips from the book appear on Ecolife, a Web site devoted to green living. He says yellow tomatoes are less enticing than red ones; protective fencing and belligerent signs are acceptable; and hiding desirable fruits like raspberries behind beets or parsnips is smart strategy. He also has a Zen-like attitude to dealing with stealing. ''Invent some better scenario,'' he wrote, ''where the stolen food somehow ends up in the stomachs of people who need it.''
Robert Cruz helped build the 103rd Street Community Garden in East Harlem, with money from the New York Restoration Project. Since 2004, he has watched over the various herbs, fruits and vegetables in the nine plots, along with two pomegranate trees and the winter-hardy banana tree he calls ''the star of the show'' for the nostalgia it inspires among his Caribbean neighbors.
This summer, the garden, which has sports areas, a shaded picnic space and vegetable plots, is under reconstruction and will be getting a protective fence around the planting area. The old wire mesh was not up to the task of keeping probing hands out of the tomato and pepper patches. ''The joke is that we're going to install a 220-volt electric fence to keep the thieves away,'' Mr. Cruz said.
''I know that people who garden in the country have trouble with squirrels and deer and turkeys; here in our neighborhood, we have old ladies,'' he said. ''They're the culprit.''
Mr. Cruz was sitting on his stoop last summer when he noticed a couple of elderly women on hands and knees on the sidewalk clawing their way through the mesh to get at the chili peppers. They did not notice him swoop in for the bust. ''Ladies, if you would only ask, I would gladly give you more than what you're stealing,'' he remembers telling them before he gave them a tour, and some peppers.
''My philosophy is that I can either get very selfish or I can take pleasure that what I plant gave somebody else pleasure,'' Mr. Cruz said. ''If taking a ripe tomato that doesn't belong to them is going to make someone's day, let them have it.''
At the Brooklyn Bears community garden on Pacific Street, the most egregious bandits, members said, were an elderly man who thought it his right to fill shopping bags with produce and a gardener whose key was taken away after she was repeatedly caught pocketing the vegetables of others. A peach tree by the fence had a branch ripped off by sidewalk ''grazers'' (a euphemism gardeners use for thieves), but all things considered, said Jon Crow, who has gardened there for 26 years, the loss to theft is minimal. Like many gardens, the Pacific Street garden has a communal planting box where goodies like cherry tomatoes are free for the plucking.
''As the saying goes, you don't get too attached to your farm animals, and you don't get too attached to your vegetables in a community garden,'' Mr. Crow said. He sees the next threat to the gardens as politics, not pilferage; the GreenThumb initiative operates on $800,000 in federal funds annually, a perennial target of cost-cutting. (This season's subsidy was restored after the city's community gardening coalition organized a rally and petition campaign.) ''The community gardening movement here would be lost without GreenThumb,'' he warned.
Ms. Snyder, crestfallen after losing her ripe tomatoes to theft on July 12, had better news two weeks later. One of her surviving tomatoes was finally ready for harvest. It tasted like validation.

ATOMIC BOMB SURVIVORS
JOIN NUCLEAR POWER PROTEST
As both Hiroshima and Nagasaki mark the 66th anniversary of the twin American atomic attacks at the end of World War II, the survivors are hoping that they can use their unique moral standing to wean both Japan and the world away from what they see as tragedy-prone efforts to tap the atom. PAGE 11
RECOGNIZING RESCUE GROUP
Activists known as the Bergson Group have been credited by modern historians with playing a pivotal role in rescuing hundreds of thousands of European Jews. But the group was rejected by the Jewish establishment it challenged, both in the United States and in Israel, where its militant Zionism and right-wing politics clashed with the less-assertive and generally liberal mainstream. Recently, prominent historians have begun to recognize the group's achievements. PAGE 10 
CHINA'S HANDPICKED LAMA
Emotions have spiked as news spread that China's handpicked Panchen Lama, the second most important religious figure in Tibetan Buddhism, might be going to study at the Labrang monastery in Xiahe. The main problem is that this Panchen Lama, 21, is one of two young men with claims to the title. One was selected by the Dalai Lama, and the other by the Chinese Communist Party. PAGE 5
RARE SANCTUARY IN LIBYA
In a city of tapped phone lines and ubiquitous government informers, Mass at the Church of Christ the King in Tripoli is a rare place where people can speak freely about the anxious, ever-shifting mood of their city. For this week's sermon at the capital's main Protestant church, the Rev. Hamdy Daoud chose the trial of Hosni Mubarak. Members of his congregation braved the city's checkpoints to make it to Anglican Mass. PAGE 9

STATES TAKE RECOVERY
INTO THEIR OWN HANDS
This year, at least 500 new laws have been passed and signed by governors that aim at economic recovery. But with most states struggling to balance their budgets -- and with Washington planning trillions of dollars in cuts in coming years -- there is also painfully little money available to dive in with ambitious job-creation programs. PAGE 12
BARBERS DEFY RECESSION
The Census Bureau recently noted in an otherwise glum report about mom-and-pop businesses that the number of hairdressers and barbers and the shops they work in grew by about 8 percent from 2008 to 2009, one of the few industries to register growth in a tough economic climate. PAGE 18

Some former Brooklyn residents who grew claustrophobic in the city have found an alternative in Millerton, a small town in Dutchess County with an artistic tilt. Call it the Brooklynization of the Hudson Valley, the steady hipness creep with its locavore cuisine, its Williamsburgian bars, and its recent arrivals from New York City. PAGE 21

AS LOCHTE RAISES PROFILE,
IMAGE MAKERS DIVE IN
In Shanghai, the swimmer Ryan Lochte aced his screen test to be the leading man of the London Olympic Games, which means that for the next 11 months, he will be treated like a movie star. Will the increased attention cramp his style? For those in his inner circle, it is no minor worry. PAGE 1
GIANTS LOOK FOR RHYTHM
Every N.F.L. team had to deal with the sudden end of the lockout, the frenetic transaction period, the complex rules governing when free agents could take the field and the elimination of two-a-day contact practices. The problem has been acute for the Giants, who were forced to practice without many key players before the collective bargaining agreement was ratified. PAGE 6
PLAYING AS IF IT'S OCTOBER
In Nick Swisher's world, a battle for first place between the Yankees and the Red Sox during the first weekend of August may as well be the middle of October. The opening game of a three-game series when both teams are steaming toward the postseason was apparently no different from their sudden-death playoff in 1978, writes Harvey Araton. PAGE 3
P.G.A. RETURNS TO OLD HOME
The P.G.A. Championship, the last of the year's four major championships, returns to the Atlanta Athletic Club for the first time since 2001 this week, and the golf course will be longer, tougher and faster than the one on which David Toms won his lone major by holding off Phil Mickelson a decade ago.

Hidden expenses associated with how local governments finance themselves are compounding financial problems down at city halls. Wall Street banks have peddled to municipalities all sorts of financial products, some of which have become costly mistakes, Gretchen Morgenson says. PAGE 1
ECONOMICS OF MARRIAGE
In some cultures, romance isn't nearly as important as cash when it comes to choosing a marriage partner. And even when money plays no explicit role in selecting a mate, courtship customs are governed by the venerable economic model of supply and demand, says Robert H. Frank. PAGE 4
HEARING THE FUTURE
The story of the invention of the wah-wah pedal, which enables an electric guitar to take on aspects of the human voice -- and which helped define the sounds of rock stars like Jimi Hendrix and Eric Clapton -- is complicated.

The hijacking of the Alabama drew attention to the return of a scourge once associated with plank-walks, treasure chests and peg-legged marauders.

HEADLINE: Win Together or Lose Together

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN. 
Nicholas D. Kristof is off today.

 BODY:
IN the wake of the hugely disappointing budget deal and the S.& P.'s debt downgrade, maybe we need to hang a new sign in the immigration arrival halls at all U.S. ports and airports. It could simply read: ''Welcome. You are entering the United States of America. Past performance is not necessarily indicative of future returns.''
Because our country is now finding itself in the worst kind of decline -- a slow decline, just slow enough for us to keep deluding ourselves that nothing really fundamental needs to change if our future is to match our past. 
Our slow decline is a product of two inter-related problems. First, we've let our five basic pillars of growth erode since the end of the cold war -- education, infrastructure, immigration of high-I.Q. innovators and entrepreneurs, rules to incentivize risk-taking and start-ups, and government-funded research to spur science and technology.
We mistakenly treated the end of the cold war as a victory that allowed us to put our feet up -- when it was actually the onset of one of the greatest challenges we've ever faced. We helped to unleash two billion people just like us -- in China, India and Eastern Europe. For us to effectively compete and collaborate with them -- to maintain the American dream -- required studying harder, investing wiser, innovating faster, upgrading our infrastructure quicker and working smarter.
Instead of doing that at the scale we needed -- that is, building muscle -- we injected ourselves with massive amounts of credit steroids (just like our baseball players). This enabled millions of people to buy homes they could not afford and to fill jobs in construction and retail that did not require that much education. Our European friends went on a similar binge.
All this debt blew up in 2008 in the U.S. and Europe, and that led to the second problem: Homeowners, firms, banks and governments are all now ''deleveraging'' or trying to -- meaning that they are saving more, shopping less, paying off debts and trying to dig out from mortgages that are under water.
No one better explains the implications of this than Kenneth Rogoff, a professor of economics at Harvard, who argued in an essay last week for Project Syndicate that we are not in a Great Recession but in a Great (Credit) Contraction: ''Why is everyone still referring to the recent financial crisis as the 'Great Recession?' '' asked Rogoff. ''The phrase 'Great Recession' creates the impression that the economy is following the contours of a typical recession, only more severe -- something like a really bad cold. ... But the real problem is that the global economy is badly overleveraged, and there is no quick escape without a scheme to transfer wealth from creditors to debtors, either through defaults, financial repression, or inflation. ...
''In a conventional recession,'' Rogoff noted, ''the resumption of growth implies a reasonably brisk return to normalcy. The economy not only regains its lost ground, but, within a year, it typically catches up to its rising long-run trend. The aftermath of a typical deep financial crisis is something completely different. ... It typically takes an economy more than four years just to reach the same per capita income level that it had attained at its pre-crisis peak. ... Many commentators have argued that fiscal stimulus has largely failed not because it was misguided, but because it was not large enough to fight a 'Great Recession.' But, in a 'Great Contraction,' problem No. 1 is too much debt.'' Until we find ways to restructure and forgive some of these debts from consumers, firms, banks and governments, spending to drive growth is not going to come back at the scale we need.
Our challenge now, therefore, is to deleverage the economy as fast as possible, while, at the same time, getting back to investing as much as possible in our real pillars of growth so our recovery is built on sustainable businesses and real jobs and not just on another round of credit injections.
Regarding deleveraging, Rogoff suggests, for example, that the government facilitate the writing down of mortgages in exchange for a share of any future home-price appreciation.
Regarding growth, we surely need a much smarter long-term fiscal plan than the one that just came out of Washington. We need to cut spending in areas and on a time schedule that will hurt the least; we need to raise taxes in ways that will hurt the least (now is the perfect time for a gasoline tax rather than payroll taxes); and we need to use some of these revenues to invest in the pillars of our growth, with special emphasis on infrastructure, research and incentives for risk-taking and start-ups. We need to offer every possible incentive to get Americans to start new businesses to grow out of this hole.
If juggling all these needs at once sounds hard and complicated, it is. There is no easy, one-policy fix. We need to help people deleverage, cut some spending, raise some revenues and reinvest in our growth engines -- as an integrated strategy for national renewal. Something this big and complex cannot be accomplished by one party alone. It will require the kind of collective action usually reserved for national emergencies. The sooner we pull together the better.

HEADLINE: Straight Outta Havana

BYLINE: By SUJATHA FERNANDES

 BODY:
Sujatha Fernandes is an assistant professor of sociology at Queens College and the Graduate Center, City University of New York, and the author of the forthcoming ''Close to the Edge: In Search of the Global Hip Hop Generation.''
ONSTAGE is Instinto, a female trio extraordinaire. It's my first time seeing them perform in Havana. The divas are wearing shimmering strapless dresses with high heels. As a salsa beat kicks in, they shake and turn, rapping lyrically, then singing in three-part harmony. 
This is Cuban rap, where the streets meet highbrow art. It is an American-derived subculture that has flourished on the island despite -- and in some ways, because of -- the United States' half-century-long embargo against Cuba.
President Obama has relaxed travel restrictions to Cuba and has begun granting visas for visiting Cuban artists. This month, the Grammy-winning singer Pablo Milanes will tour the United States for the first time since 1979. And on Monday the National Assembly agreed to lift some restrictions on the economy. Many are celebrating these changes as the beginning of the end of the embargo and an opening of Cuban society. But it's worth remembering that, besides the hardships, there can be benefits to living in a bubble. Islands are hot spots of biodiversity. And out of isolation, Cuban art forms like rap have developed a particular richness and vitality.
Rap was originally an import. In the early '90s, young Cubans built antennas from wire coat hangers and dangled their radios out of their windows to catch 2 Live Crew and Naughty by Nature on Miami's 99 Jamz. Aspiring Cuban M.C.'s rapping at house parties and in small local venues crassly mimicked their American counterparts.
''Just like you, just like you, nigger, we wanna be a nigger like you,'' Primera Base rapped offensively about their hero, Malcolm X. The group was known to sport thick imitation gold chains and fake diamonds -- even though ''bling'' was a remote concept given Cuba's endemic scarcities.
But Cuban rap soon took on a life of its own. Unlike other hip-hop fans around the world, young Cubans had little access to the latest trends in American rap, so they had to look inward for inspiration. With only two state-run TV channels, they couldn't tune in to the globally televised Yo! MTV Raps to see pioneers like Public Enemy or N.W.A., and Havana wasn't on the touring circuit for De La Soul.
The embargo also kept out the key tools of background beats -- samplers, mixers and albums -- so Cuban rappers instead drew on a rich heritage of traditional local music, recreating the rhythmic pulse of hip-hop with instruments like the melodic Bata drums, typically used in ceremonies of the Afro-Cuban Santeria religion. In the tradition of Cuban a cappella groups like Vocal Sampling -- which conjured up full salsa orchestras solely through their voices -- Cuban rappers made up for the lack of digital technology by developing the human beat box, mimicking not just drum machines but congas, trumpets and even song samples.
Cuban rap is also special for the caliber of its lyrics. Thanks to the country's excellent and free schools, rappers -- although predominantly black and from poorer neighborhoods -- received a high degree of education. Cuba's most prolific rap producer, Pablo Herrera, was a professor of English at the University of Havana. Rap lyrics mine Cuba's literature and history in their portrayals of the tribulations of street life.
''I have a race that is dark and discriminated / I have a workday that demands and gives nothing,'' rapped Hermanos De Causa in their song ''Tengo.'' The song reworked a 1964 poem that praised the achievements of the revolution for blacks; a new generation was watching those gains erode.
The increasing innovativeness of Cuban rap stands in stark contrast to American rap, where the diversity of sounds and themes has been eschewed in favor of a catchy pop formula with a focus on consumption. Hip-hop originated in the outdoor jams and battles of the Bronx during the 1970s, and commercial distribution began in 1979, when the Sugarhill Gang's ''Rapper's Delight'' became a hit. Global entertainment networks have promoted many influential rap artists, like Run-D.M.C. and Salt-n-Pepa, but today there is less and less room for American rappers to experiment with unconventional subjects and styles.
Cuban rappers avoided this fate for a number of reasons. One was government support. Initially, the government criticized the ''racially divisive'' culture of rap, but seeing how popular it was among the youth, the state soon came around. It began to support the annual rap festivals and now finances a yearly international hip-hop symposium. In Cuba, many musicians are full-time employees of the state, paid a monthly salary for performing, composing and rehearsing. Starting last decade, prominent rappers also entered into this arrangement, freeing them to be creative rather than producing generic salsa-rap fusions to appeal to foreign record labels.
The government's interest in rap isn't all positive, however. With state sponsorship comes state censorship: Rappers who criticize the government risk being censored on the radio or barred from performing in prominent venues. But censorship, like seclusion, can foster innovation. Cuban artists perfected techniques of metaphor, allusion and ambiguity to trick the censors. The rapper Magia Lopez of Obsesion defended a song, from her 2002 album, that was about prostitutes in barrios like Central Havana by saying that it was about capitalist countries. But she had never been to a capitalist country when she wrote it. The song takes on a universal appeal because of the artist's need to dissemble.
This is, of course, not an argument in favor of state censorship or the embargo -- which has deprived Cubans of basic necessities like food and medicine. The recent openings initiated by the Obama administration should be celebrated. But we can also recognize that some things, like the distinctiveness of Cuban rap, may be lost as the country opens up to a global market economy. It's worth remembering that imposed, even self-imposed, isolation can be a crucible for artistic creativity.

HEADLINE: Anger Over Credit Ratings Resurfaces in Washington

BYLINE: By LOUISE STORY, JULIE CRESWELL and GRETCHEN MORGENSON; Nelson Schwartz contributed reporting.

 BODY:
The frustration in the air was palpable. Officials from the credit ratings agency Standard & Poor's were meeting with Congressional leaders on a stifling late day in late July to discuss the thorniest issue in Washington: the effort to cut the nation's deficit and raise the borrowing limit to avert a default.
S.& P. and two financial industry groups listened to various proposals for debt reduction and warned the lawmakers of the impact a default would have on world markets, according to a Congressional staff member in attendance. The staff member said the agency was providing guidance on what target to hit in budget savings, but lawmakers struggled to understand the agency's views. 
Since that meeting, several lawmakers have publicly questioned whether the ratings agencies have the competence to evaluate the country's finances, and whether it was appropriate for them to be so deeply involved in discussions of fiscal politics. The criticism reached a fevered pitch after S.& P. announced Friday night that it was downgrading America's credit rating, a decision that thrust the ratings agencies to the center of the debate over the government's budget, and prompted renewed scrutiny of an industry that has been harshly criticized since the financial crisis.
The ratings agencies' purview is traditionally viewed as evaluating data and revenue projections for debt issuers, but they have long taken governance into account for ratings of sovereign nations and corporations. In its announcement Friday night, S.& P. cited the political gridlock in Washington during the debt limit debate as a main reason for its decision. ''The gulf between the political parties,'' S.& P. said, had reduced its confidence in the government's ability to manage its finances.
In an interview Saturday, David Beers, the global head of sovereign ratings for the agency, said ''we have to look at the process under which government policy is made.''
But some politicians questioned whether governance issues should play such a large role in the country's debt rating.
Randy Neugebauer, a Texas Republican who heads the House Financial Services' Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations, said it was appropriate for S.& P. to consider the political situation in its analysis. But he said that it was speculative for the agency to use predictions of what Congress would do in the future as a rationale for a downgrade.
''One thing that puts them out in uncharted waters is trying to predict what the political environment is going to be,'' Mr. Neugebauer said in an interview. ''They're not predicting an overly cooperative environment in Congress and that's a very subjective call.''
The tension between Congress and the ratings agencies could have tangible results on the companies' futures if it speeds up new rules that lessen their roles in the market. As part of the financial reform bill passed last summer, regulators are supposed to write rules designed to reduce the heavy reliance on credit ratings by banks and other buyers of debt securities, a policy that has its roots in the 1930s.
Federal bank regulators have not yet created these rules and a Congressional committee held a hearing on July 27 on the slow pace of regulators' implementation of this part of the law. Fierce debate broke out at the hearing about whether it was appropriate for the ratings agencies -- companies regulated by the federal government -- to be rating United States debt at all.
The pushback against S.& P. echoes the complaints of other governments that have had their debt downgraded and responded with cries of unfairness.
Much of the enmity dates to the financial crisis. All three ratings agencies failed to see the credit crisis coming, and for years they bestowed AAA ratings on bundles of mortgage bonds, even though many of the loans inside those securities were highly questionable. Scores of investors purchased the securities based on the positive ratings; when the mortgages inside those deals went south, investors lost billions of dollars, kicking off the panic that drove the financial crisis.
The ratings agencies, which profited richly during the mortgage boom by rating those deals, have been identified along with banks and mortgage lenders as parties that contributed to the country economic collapse. Despite all that, the agencies still retain lots of weight in the financial markets, and investors have been following their views carefully on sovereign debt in places like Greece, Japan, Italy and, now, the United States.
Moody's and Fitch have not downgraded the United States, though their analysts said in interviews that a downgrade remains a possibility. Analysts from Fitch Ratings were in their offices over the weekend, churning through financial data. The company has said it may take all month to decide. ''Our rating is triple A until the day it changes,'' said David Riley, the head of global government debt at Fitch Ratings from his office in London. ''That being said, we haven't formally reaffirmed the rating.''
Moody's reaffirmed the country's AAA, though it did put the country on negative outlook on Tuesday. The company's sovereign analyst said Saturday the company is not as concerned about political gridlock.
''Despite the contentious political environment and the difficulties in coming to an agreement -- even if it's not the ideal one -- they still reached an agreement which we think is a turning point in fiscal policy,'' said Steven Hess, the lead analyst on U.S. government debt at Moody's. ''It is not enough, but we thought a downgrade would be premature given that they have come up with a plan for deficit reduction.''
Analysts at Fitch agree with Moody's that, by various debt ratios, the United States is not out of line with other AAA-rated countries -- putting the two at odds with S.& P. But Fitch's top sovereign analyst said it would be monitoring the ability of lawmakers to agree on $1.5 trillion in further cuts and, if they can't, it will look to see if Congress follows the triggers for automatic cuts it put in place last week.
''We've had similar triggers in place under previous budget acts and sometimes they're allowed to operate and sometimes not,'' said Mr. Riley , of Fitch.
He acknowledged there was a perception in the markets that a country is not a true AAA if all three major agencies do not agree.
''In that respect, S.& P.'s action has already weakened the U.S.' profile,'' Mr. Riley added.

HEADLINE: Blurring the Wealth Boundary

BYLINE: By ALISON GREGOR

 BODY:
WHEN the developers of Atlantic Terrace, an 80-unit co-op in Fort Greene, began planning, they envisioned occupants reflecting the populace on the sidewalks of Brooklyn -- that is, diverse in all ways, but especially economically.
That meant even the wealthiest buyers would be living side by side with those of moderate and low incomes. The developers, a partnership of the nonprofit Fifth Avenue Committee Inc., the architecture firm Magnusson Architecture and Planning, and the builder Mega Contracting, said they knew they had a challenge when it came to selling the market-rate apartments, because in many developments, lower-income apartments are physically segregated. 
''Really, New York City is one of the most segregated cities in the United States,'' while also being one of the most diverse, said Michelle de la Uz, the executive director of Fifth Avenue Committee.
When for-profit developers create affordable housing without public subsidies, they typically receive benefits like less restrictive zoning regulations or height limitations. But often those affordable apartments end up isolated, either in the nether regions of the building, with a separate entrance and elevator, or in a different building altogether.
Atlantic Terrace, however, is on land provided by the city, and a significant portion of its $38 million budget was publicly subsidized. The city requires developers who accept subsidies to be more inclusive with their affordable units than developers who don't, and at Atlantic Terrace, at 212 South Oxford Street and Atlantic Avenue, the developers created 20 market-rate apartments that are mixed in among 60 affordable ones.
They ''went above and beyond,'' said Joan Tally, the executive vice president for real estate and the chief of staff at the New York City Housing Development Corporation, which provided a $3.7 million construction loan and a $6.7 million mortgage for Atlantic Terrace.
''The unique thing about Atlantic Terrace is that they've used their market-rate units to get more affordability in the affordable units,'' Ms. Tally said, meaning that the apartments are affordable to people of the lowest income, not just middle-income buyers as in many subsidized developments.
Of the affordable units, 31 were sold to people earning 80 percent of the area median income ($79,200 for a household of four), and 19 were sold to those earning 130 percent of it. The nine apartments in the lowest income tier were reserved for those earning 65 percent of the area median.
Affordable apartments are scattered throughout the building, on the same floors as market-rate units, and even have some of the better views. Layouts are identical, and while some finishes in the affordable apartments are a bit less expensive, some are identical, like the IceStone countertops that were made in the nearby Brooklyn Navy Yard.
''The key to making this project successful was selling the market-rate units,'' said Magnus Magnusson, a principal at Magnusson Architecture and Planning, ''so we needed to design the whole look of the building, from the outside to the lobby to the hallways, to look like a market-rate building.''
Almost all of the 60 affordable apartments sold quickly in a city lottery, while nine market-rate apartments have sold or are in contract, four of them two-bedroom penthouses, since they went on the market last October, said Heather Gershen, the director of housing development for Fifth Avenue Committee. The three remaining penthouses range in price from $950,000 to $1.1 million, and the remaining one-, two- and three-bedroom units range from $385,000 to $775,000.
Mike Leslie, a transplant from San Francisco who bought the original model penthouse unit with his partner, Michael Richardson, said the fact that there were low-income owners in Atlantic Terrace had not given them pause. The looming issue for the couple was the construction of the arena for the New Jersey Nets going on across the avenue at the Atlantic Yards site, but after determining that construction noise was minimal, they were won over by the 463-square-foot terrace with their penthouse, Mr. Richardson said.
Both he and Mr. Leslie noted that, while not actively seeking ''diversity'' in their home search, they both appreciated some of the results brought about by that goal in Atlantic Terrace. For example, all the cabinetwork in the affordable apartments, along with the bathroom cabinets in market-rate units, was done by Brooklyn Woods, a work-force development program.
''That kind of gives you a good feeling about it,'' Mr. Richardson said. ''But it's also beautifully done.''

HEADLINE: Bike Vacations Offer Freedom and Frugality

BYLINE: By SEAN PATRICK FARRELL

 BODY:
LIKE many New Yorkers, Alan Tansey is planning an escape this summer -- in his case, a 370-mile journey north through New York State, over the Canadian border and into the heart of Montreal.
But unlike the hordes who brave highway traffic or airport lines to break free of the city, Mr. Tansey will start enjoying himself as soon as he lugs his titanium touring bicycle down the stairs of his apartment building in Greenpoint, Brooklyn.
''I'd rather just hop on my bike and have fun rather than go to some destination,'' said Mr. Tansey, 28, an architect who plans to ride next month through Manhattan, over the George Washington Bridge and along the Hudson River, where cool breezes rise and skyscrapers give way to arching trees. 
As New Yorkers experience another summer of economic jitters and rising gasoline prices, the bike vacation is looking better than ever as an inexpensive and self-powered alternative to motorized trips.
The Adventure Cycling Association, a nonprofit organization that promotes bicycle touring and charts bike routes around the country, says 2010 was a bumper year for bicycle travel.
The group, based in Missoula, Mont., reports a jump in annual sales of its carefully detailed maps of New York State biking routes to more than 1,200, from about 200 a decade ago. Among its 44,700 members are 1,600 from New York State.
Though the freedom of bike travel is a major motivator for many New York City cyclists, another draw is its frugality. Touring can cost as little as $20 to $30 a day, not counting the investment in a bicycle and gear, said Allison Burtch, 28, a resident of Crown Heights, Brooklyn, who is a researcher for the artist Maya Lin's What is Missing? Foundation. Last year, Ms. Burtch spent eight days pedaling and camping around the Adirondacks.
Others choose the lighter-weight but more expensive option of staying in motels and eating at restaurants along the way.
Food is the fuel of any bike vacation, said Ms. Burtch, and can easily account for much of the cost. ''You always spend more on food than you want to because you're ravenous,'' she said.
The appeal of the open road has long drawn New York cyclists into the countryside. More than a century ago, this newspaper's bicycle column Gossip of the Wheelmen reported on ''cycling tours nearby and to distant points,'' including a journey to Washington that it described as ''An Interesting Trip for Cyclers Over Mostly Good Roads.''
Good roads remain the Grail of the touring cyclist. Tim Holmes, who helped develop a new Web site of routes in the Adirondacks, Bike the Byways, praises the six-foot-wide shoulders on that region's roads -- a particular selling point for any rider who has shared a narrow highway with cars whizzing by, only inches away.
Riders point their wheels in every direction from the city; some go to the end of Long Island, while others head south and west, taking ferries, trains or bridges to cross water barriers. But many of the most popular routes remain north of the city, where small-town cafes and sleepy rural roads lie within quick reach.
Carol Waaser, a seasoned rider who has toured across Europe and from St. Petersburg to Istanbul, often takes jaunts upstate with fellow members of the New York Cycling Club.
''It's a down-to-earth way to get around, and you have time to see the countryside,'' said Ms. Waaser, 65, who retired this year as an executive with Actors' Equity and has made many trips up to New England over the years. While stopping to fix a flat tire upstate one year, she was offered a glass of water by a friendly resident. Now, Ms. Waaser stops to visit the woman every time she rides through the area.
For all the lure of a long road trip, though, many New Yorkers find their adventure within city limits. Every weekend a steady line of cyclists, their bikes loaded with towels, snacks and sunscreen, streams south through Brooklyn and across the Marine Parkway Bridge toward the secluded sands of the Rockaways.
''My ride to get out of the heat of the city is to go to the beach,'' said Ed Glazar, 41, a former messenger and now a bicycle tour guide based in Central Park. This year Mr. Glazar helped write and published a pocket-size book, ''BikeNYC: The Cyclist's Guide to New York City,'' detailing routes around the city, including the Rockaways. He, like many cyclists, is a fan of the area's remote Fort Tilden Beach.
And for those testing their touring legs and camping equipment, reserving a camping spot at Floyd Bennett Field, just across the parkway bridge in Brooklyn, can be ideal, said Jessica Wolf, 27, a graphic designer who lives in Prospect Heights, Brooklyn.
Ms. Wolf is planning a trip northeast to the Bay of Fundy this summer. Having made the journey through the crowded city with a loaded touring bike on previous trips, she said she would probably take a bus to Boston for the first leg. But once on the bike, she said, she will slow down and relax.
''It's the best way to travel,'' she said, ''You get to experience everything -- the weather, the smells -- and meet people that you wouldn't if you were driving.''

HEADLINE: Mike Kirby

BYLINE: By VIVIAN MARINO

 BODY:
Mr. Kirby, 50, is a founder and the chairman of Green Street Advisors, an independent research and consulting firm that tracks the commercial real estate industry, with an emphasis on real estate investment trusts, or REITs, public companies that disburse most of their income as dividends. Mr. Kirby, who started the company in 1985, also serves as its research director.
Q How did the firm get started? 
A I was 24 -- straight out of University of Chicago business school -- when I started the company with Jon Fosheim. He stayed for 20 years, then went off to start up a hedge fund. We started Green Street to do something a little different than what it now does: we were looking for opportunities in the junkyard, basically distressed properties.
We came across a couple of REITs that bankers were having problems with, and did our own due diligence. We came to the conclusion, in the case of one, that the company was worth less than zero. Then we came across a research report by a major Wall Street house that said this company was a $12 stock and that they just did an equity offering. That's when the light bulb went on over our heads that a) nobody really understood the real estate in REITs; and b) the conflicts were pretty egregious.
Q How have REITs changed since you began tracking them?
A REITs were a $10 billion niche; now it's about $350 billion. We follow over 90 percent of the market cap of U.S. REITs and now over 50 percent of the market cap in European REITs. Our business grows as the industry grows.
Q What is your assessment of the domestic REIT market?
A REITs had a great 2.5-year run: they delivered total returns of 27 percent two years ago and 20 percent last year, and this year they're up something like 10 percent year to date. That's the good news. The bad news is, that came on the heels of a 75 percent drop.
Q So what does this mean for average investors?
A Most people should be 5 to 10 percent in real estate; it's an asset class that tends to zig when other things zag, and so it's a good diversifier. To the investor already in REITs, it's probably not a bad idea to be on the lighter side of allocation. Today we sort of view the valuations as on the rich side.
Q Who are your main clients?
A Generally mutual fund managers or pension fund advisers.
Q Are you bullish on any commercial property sectors now?
A The one sector that's just on fire is apartments, and this is true in New York and nationwide. So what's happened in apartment land is, the fundamentals didn't weaken as much as in the other sectors. During the downturn, they were supported by the fact that the homeownership rate declined through the recession, creating more demand for apartments. Meanwhile, there's been very little construction in the last few years, and really there won't be any in another year or two. That has been sort of a perfect storm for apartments.
Q How is the New York office market faring?
A New York is doing better right now from a fundamental and a valuation perspective. We didn't see anything near the layoffs we feared we might during the downturn, and there is increasing demand. You're also seeing rents jump up.
If you're buying in New York today, you really have to be pretty bullish that New York is always going to be the dominant place that attracts the best and the brightest of whatever industry, which has certainly been true over the last 20 years.
Q Do you have any numbers?
A During the trough in early- to mid-'09, Manhattan office values went down over 50 percent, and since then they've rallied up 78 percent from the trough. So today we're 15 to 20 percent lower than the '07 peak.
Q A couple of years ago it was difficult even to put a value on many properties.
A Right, it was pretty much a guessing game. The market is pretty liquid now. Pricing among higher-quality property has really skyrocketed in the past two years. I think that's going to level off because we're going to see a lot more stuff get put up for sale.
Q That's good for all the cash-ready institutions, like REITs, waiting on the sidelines to buy.
A In the last year they've had trouble finding enough stuff to buy. A lot of REITs are well positioned to take advantage of any buying opportunities. I don't think they're going to be necessarily distressed sales. There will be bidding contests.
Q Your bio says you were born on Christmas.
A It's kind of nice having a birthday on Christmas once you're older, because then you could either ignore it or at least you've got all your family around.

HEADLINE: Pressing All the Buttons For a Panic Attack

BYLINE: By JULIE CRESWELL

 BODY:
BRADLEY ALFORD, a money manager in Atlanta, just hit the panic button.
No, really. Mr. Alford just hit the key on his computer that initiates the Wall Street equivalent of the nuclear option: Sell everything.
He was acting on orders from two wealthy clients who became so alarmed by the troubled outlook that they simply wanted out. Over the last 10 days or so, they asked him to sell all of their stocks and invest in a mutual fund he oversees that is somewhat insulated against a potential market collapse.
''I have never, ever done it before,'' says Mr. Alford, who is the chairman of Alpha Capital Management and has been managing money for 22 years. ''This was unprecedented.''
The pros on Wall Street are forever telling us to keep socking our money away in that 401(k) plan and to keep believing, whatever the market's daily ups or downs. But after a week like the one we just had, the worst since the dark days of 2008, even the smart-money crowd seems to have second thoughts about the old steady-as-she-goes approach. 
As the Dow Jones industrial average plunged 513 points last Thursday, then gyrated wildly on Friday, all of Wall Street seemed to be asking the same question: What the heck is going on? Evidence that the American economy is bad and growing worse has been piling up for a while now. And it's not as if we didn't know Europe had a debt problem. Why, then, all these crazy swings?
One possible answer comes from, all of places, the fields of psychology and neuroscience. In recent years, an area of study called neurofinance has tried to use brain science to explain how our primal circuits can, and often do, override our reason when it comes to investing.
It's a heretical thought on Wall Street, where most people insist that logic prevails. The economic theory of rational expectations has enshrined the principle that people make judicious economic choices and learn from their mistakes. As a result, our collective expectations about the financial future -- from the price of T-bills next week to the earnings of Google next quarter -- are, on average, accurate.
Or so the theory goes. In practice, we do stupid things all the time. Some of us gamble away money, doubling down when logic tells us to quit. Others let their winnings ride when any rational person would cash out.
But many experts say the 2008 financial collapse recalibrated investor psychology. After living through the collapse of Lehman Brothers and the panic that followed, some investors are apt to sell first and ask questions later. Wall Street's notion of worst-case scenarios has darkened considerably.
The result: the markets go wild. After a little good news on jobs on Friday -- new figures showed the jobless rate slipped a notch in July -- the Dow bolted higher. But by noon it had plunged more than 400 points from its morning high. It closed at 11,444.61, down 5.75 percent for the week and 1.15 percent for the year. Like most major markets, the American stock market has now officially entered a ''correction,'' one of those mini-bear markets that sometimes prove fleeting and, sometimes, are a harbinger of worse to come.
FINANCIAL markets rarely move in straight lines, and whatever the pundits say, it's not always easy to pinpoint what made them move this way or that on a given day. But in New York, London, Tokyo and beyond, a broad shift appears to be occurring. All those graphs and charts are, basically, a representation of our collective financial neurocircuitry getting a bit panicky.
Some large investors, including wealthy individuals who lost big during the 2008 collapse, have more or less been stashing money under the mattress. They have been selling investments aggressively and seeking safety in cash. Over the last three weeks or so, hedge fund managers have been betting that stocks will fall further.
Dick Del Bello, senior partner of Conifer Securities, a company that provides administrative support to hedge funds, says funds have started to place more wagers against the markets, if only to protect themselves. But as a whole, he says, they are still betting that stocks will go up, rather than down.
''Hedge funds decided to add to their short positions and play more defensively,'' he says.
And yet it seems clear that Wall Street is finally realizing what many ordinary Americans have been feeling for a while: these hard times are turning harder. Sure, major American corporations are making fistfuls of money. But smaller businesses aren't. The American consumer confronts a toxic mix of weak home prices and high unemployment. Confidence is fragile.
Granted, people have been trying to explain the financial markets for more than a century. In 1900, the French mathematician Louis Bachelier argued that markets were essentially random. In other words, no one can forecast the markets accurately.
John Maynard Keynes, in his famous 1936 work, ''The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money,'' likened the stock market to a beauty contest that ran in the newspapers of his day. Readers were asked to pick which would be voted the prettiest face. The key to selecting the winner, Keynes argued, wasn't choosing the face you think is the most beautiful, but rather anticipating the face that others will pick.
Such theories aside, the uncertainties in the financial world now seem to have overloaded our collective financial brains, at least judging by the markets.
Denise Shull, the founder of Trader Psyches, which consults funds and investors on neuroscience strategies, says many investors are using the 2008 panic as their new reference point. After so many people lost so much money, many investors no longer hesitate to sell at the first sign of trouble, he says.
''How your brain deals with uncertainty -- when it recognizes it is in an uncertain situation -- is that it tries to pull it from a bigger context,'' Ms. Shull says. ''The context of 2008 and not wanting to see it happen again would absolutely influence these people to hit the sell button. Then it becomes self-fulfilling for the market.''
IT has actually been relatively easy to make money on Wall Street over the last year or so. Buoyed by hopes that the Federal Reserve would be able to reignite growth through quantitative easing, its controversial bond-buying program, the American stock market shot up last August and kept on rising fairly steadily through this May.
That run gave investors, the pros and individuals alike, a false sense of security, says Roy Niederhoffer, who runs a money management firm called R.G. Niederhoffer Capital Management.
Mr. Niederhoffer has a degree in computational neuroscience from Harvard and is a big believer in the idea that neuroscience can help people invest. He says he was surprised at how complacent investors have been, given Europe's problems, the slack American economy and, until a deal last week, the debt-ceiling showdown in Washington.
One measure of that complacency is the Chicago Board Options Exchange's VIX index, which uses the price of stock options to measure investors' expectations about future volatility. After spiking following the earthquake in Japan this year, the VIX drifted lower through June and remained relatively subdued until early July. It has since shot up, although it remains far below the record levels hit during the financial crisis.
Richard Sylla, a finance professor at the Stern School of Business at New York University who has written about market sell-offs, said the plunge last week had all the hallmarks of a classic panic attack. The debt-ceiling debate, concern over the American economy, Europe -- the bad news just kept coming, and investors finally snapped.
''When you pile all of those things together, investors become queasy,'' he says.
Mr. Niederhoffer agrees. ''I think, without question, there's been a tremendous shift in psychology, but it took a while,'' he says. Even when the market began to wobble last month, many investors refused to throw in the towel.
Mr. Niederhoffer has actually had a tough time because investors have been so complacent. He tends to zig when other investors zag, known as a contrarian strategy. Last week, two of his hedge funds were up 8.6 percent and 13.5 percent.
Now he smells opportunity. ''We see what's happening as a return of the psychology of the markets in 2007 and 2008,'' he said. ''This feels like it's got legs.''
If he's right, investors had better fasten their seat belts.

HEADLINE: In State Capitals, Officials Take Recovery Into Their Own Hands

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON

 BODY:
DENVER -- Here is one measure of the nation's lingering economic trouble and the political anxiety festering in state capitals over jobs and angry voters: 500.
That is the number of new laws, at a minimum, that have been passed and signed by governors since Jan. 1 that were aimed in some fashion at economic recovery, according to the bipartisan National Conference of State Legislatures.
But with most states struggling to balance their budgets -- and with Washington planning trillions of dollars in cuts in coming years -- there is also painfully little money available to dive in with ambitious job-creation programs or investing in infrastructure, for example. If anything, the debt deal struck in Washington last week, with its attendant cuts in the federal budget, will only increase the pressure on state and local governments.
The result is a scattershot of economic body-building ideas and innovations mostly on the cheap -- some clever, some desperate, some unpredictable in their consequences. 
Hawaii, for example, authorized an emergency transfer of money from environmental cleanup to economic development.
Indiana declared methane gas from landfills to be a ''renewable energy resource,'' allowing incentives to be paid from an existing development fund.
Here in Colorado, the state is trying a bottom-up approach, looking for ideas -- through meetings and sessions in every county, from rural to urban -- about what might work in creating jobs and what should be dumped as a hindrance.
A 44,000-word document summarizing the new laws, assembled by the Conference of State Legislatures, echoes with terms of a troubled time: ''distress'' appears nine times, ''emergency'' 14 times and ''job creation,'' the Big Kahuna, 43 times.
''The whole landscape is changing -- it's hard to describe where it's going to end up,'' said Mark Lange, the executive director of the Edward Lowe Foundation, a nonprofit group in Cassopolis, Mich., that works with states and communities on economic development.
The chronic news-loop image of Washington stewing in its own sauce of budgetary dysfunction is part of the backdrop to the new laws, state officials and economists say.
Equally important is that numerous state governments across the nation shifted to Republican control in last November's elections. Republicans netted five governor's seats, while in the legislatures, the surge was even more pronounced. Hundreds of new Republican lawmakers, in numbers not seen since the Great Depression, took control with promises to build back battered economies.
Maryland, for example, framed a major research study on the state's economic future around the growing realization that neighboring Washington's days as a golden goose of federal jobs might soon be gone.
''The sword of Damocles is hanging over the state's economy,'' said Anirban Basu, the chairman and chief executive of the Sage Policy Group, an economic and policy consulting firm in Baltimore that worked on Maryland's new economic blueprint. ''The state simply has too many eggs in one basket, and we know that basket is about to shrink.''
Old economic development ideas, meanwhile, like the come-hither incentive packages intended to woo a company from another state -- the hallmark of economic politics in the precrash era -- have quietly gone into semiretirement, development experts say.
''There's still a lot of rhetoric, that we're going to go after some high-cost state, such as California, and get their companies to relocate, but I don't think you see quite as many incentive packages as you saw in the past, partly because the states can't afford them,'' said Kenneth E. Poole, the executive director of the Council for Community and Economic Research, a nonprofit membership group of economic-development experts.
Whether the scattering of corn seeds and big hopes from the state capitals will work is an open question.
Not every state, for example, can become a hub of say, renewable energy, which appears as a goal in at least seven of the new state laws. But a major theme of state economic aspiration is that times of turmoil -- not to mention rapid technological change -- also produce opportunity that might not have been as clear in fatter days.
''Lots of places have a vision that they won't actually ever implement,'' Mr. Poole said. ''But we can't really know the future, and sometimes pie in the sky actually comes true.''
But there is also conflict within states about how to go about creating jobs and how to balance other interests, like the environment.
Gov. John R. Kasich of Ohio, a Republican, vetoed a bill last month, for example, that would have sharply increased how much water industrial users could withdraw from Lake Erie.
The bill, passed by the Republican-controlled legislature, was couched in the language of economic competitiveness, but Mr. Kasich said the plan did not have enough ways to monitor and measure the impact on other industries, like tourism.
And some states have found even budget-conscious innovation to be too costly. Florida began a pilot project several years ago based on what is called ''economic gardening,'' which involves helping businesses solve problems through things like virtual consultants. Other states have since embraced the idea, but this year, Gov. Rick Scott, a Republican, vetoed continued financing for the program.
''It was working, but it got caught in this environment of cutting back,'' said Mr. Lange, of the Edward Lowe Foundation, which is pushing the gardening concept and helping states put it into effect.
Some state officials and independent researchers say they think the bubbling ferment of new ideas itself -- desperation as a mother of invention -- will be its own long-term force for change.
Some states, for example, have reorganized and restaffed their economic development offices with people from the private sector rather than government -- a sea change itself from plum political appointment to professionalization.
Here in Colorado, Gov. John W. Hickenlooper, a Democrat elected last year, calls the state's economic development program ''the conversation,'' a bottom-up program to collect ideas and build relationships on the ground with local businesses and county leaders. Fifty meetings were held across the state with upward of 10,000 people participating in person or having submitted comments and ideas.
Dwayne Romero, who stepped down as executive director of Colorado's Office of Economic Development and International Trade at the end of July, said he thought the conversation could ultimately become a powerful new recruiting tool for the state if it actually made things work better in the business environment.
''We can't buy your love, we can't buy your movement here -- we don't have the resources, the cash,'' Mr. Romero said.
But if the state can build a reputation, he said, as a place that actually ''has its act together,'' then that message will resonate and help the state fight back at a time when the mood of economic woe is bound up with political dysfunction.

HEADLINE: Markets Expected Credit Ruling, But Risks Remain, Analysts Say

BYLINE: By MOTOKO RICH and GRAHAM BOWLEY; Louise Story contributed reporting.

 BODY:
The hit to the United States' prized credit rating may have come as a surprise Friday, but many analysts say it's not so clear that it will deliver any immediate shock to financial markets or to consumers. That is because it confirmed what the markets, economists and most people already know: the United States has a debt problem and Washington is deeply divided over how to solve it.
''I think this is already baked in the cake,'' said Garett Jones, an economist at the Mercatus Center at George Mason University, suggesting that investors and bond traders had already accounted for a downgrade. ''It's not a disaster. It's just that we're a little bit riskier, a little bit crazier than people thought a month or two ago.''
However, with the United States economy on such fragile footing and growth remaining elusive, and with Europe desperately trying to contain its debt crisis, anything that undermines already low confidence levels could create a ripple effect and further stall the recovery. 
''It's a very emotional and volatile environment,'' said Kenneth S. Rogoff, a professor of economics at Harvard University and author, with Carmen M. Reinhart, of ''This Time Is Different,'' a history of financial crises. ''An event like this can sometimes trigger a reaction far in excess of what you might expect.''
In practical terms, investors will first focus on what happens when global markets open Monday morning, particularly in trading of Treasuries. Standard & Poor's announced its downgrade after the markets had closed on Friday. Analysts said that since Moody's and Fitch, the two other ratings agencies, have so far kept the United States at AAA, the S.& P. downgrade left Treasuries near the top of a short list of assets attractive to investors anxious about Europe's debt crisis.
''People are going to look for a safe place to hide,'' said Ward McCarthy, the chief financial economist at Jefferies, a securities and investment banking firm. ''And there aren't many places. There's gold and Treasuries.''
Although the debt downgrade itself is somewhat abstract, even those who don't pay much attention to economic news will hear of it on cable news programs and late-night comedy shows. And S.& P.'s judgment mainly reflects the anxieties many Americans are already feeling as a result of the nation's debt troubles.
''For a household, the concern is, am I going to keep my job and what are my future tax burdens?'' said Glenn Hubbard, the Columbia Business School dean who led the Council of Economic Advisers under President George W. Bush. ''If Washington is having a very difficult time getting its fiscal house in order, as a household, I either expect radical spending cuts that will affect me or radical tax increases that are going to affect me,'' Mr. Hubbard said. ''It doesn't mean I won't buy bread, but it might mean putting off purchases'' like washing machines, furniture or other large items.
The United States stock market will be a crucial barometer when Wall Street opens on Monday morning, and some analysts expect it could actually rally after the big losses last week -- down 7.1 percent in just five days. ''This may be one of those sell-the-rumor-and-buy-the-news relief rallies,'' said Mark Luschini, chief investment strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott in Philadelphia.
The stock market, though, does not have the safe haven protection of Treasuries, and is more a gauge of the broader economic outlook. With up to 70 percent of the economy driven by consumer buying, anything that could cause a further downshift in confidence is worrying.
''People may not know the exact details of what's going on, but when they hear that the U.S. is close to default, even though it may be for all practical purposes a short default, they get scared,'' said Raghuram G. Rajan, professor of economics at the University of Chicago. ''If people think the full faith and credit of the U.S. isn't what it was thought to be, they think that something has changed. It does erode confidence a little bit.''
For those worried that the downgrade could cause mutual funds, banks or money market funds to withdraw from Treasuries, there was little evidence of that over the weekend. The downgrade of long-term Treasuries does not affect the short-term federal debt widely held by money market mutual funds.
Mr. Rajan said that downgrade of debt in a smaller emerging economy would most likely immediately bring jumps in interest rates that would affect companies, home buyers and car purchases. But the strength of Treasuries, which tend to determine mortgage rates, would keep rates low for now, he said.
Indeed, Jim Moshier, general sales manager at Ricart Automotive, a car dealership in Columbus, Ohio, said the firm had ''no indication from any of the many lenders that rates will go up. No indication whatsoever.''
He said the dealership, which sells brands including Ford, Hyundai and Mazda, was enjoying a turnaround, with sales up 25 to 50 percent depending on the brand. Mr. Moshier, whose dealership had already sold 16 cars Saturday morning, said people had been holding onto cars throughout the recession and early recovery and were finally bringing them in for trades.
''We're seeing a lot of 2000-2001 trade-ins,'' Mr. Moshier said. Normally we wouldn't see 10-year-old trade-ins. We see three- to six-year-old trade-ins.''
The battered housing market has shown little sign of recovering and has suppressed consumer spending as those who previously borrowed against their home equity to finance things as varied as remodeling, new boats or college educations, now are worried they will never be able to pay back their loans.
A wave of foreclosures has further depressed housing prices and made it difficult for others to sell. In that context, the S.& P. downgrade will most likely be another drop in the bucket.
''Housing has been bumping around the bottom,'' said Richard Smith, chief of Realogy, which franchises brands including Century 21 and Coldwell Banker and owns the Corcoran Group, the New York real estate brokerage firm. ''I don't see it trending any lower than this, and we're actually starting to see price balance in a number of markets.''
Mortgage rates are unlikely to be affected immediately by the downgrade. But longer term, there is a risk that rates will rise.
''If the political situation does not improve past the next election and the fiscal situation gets worse, then people might start to agree with S.& P.'s decision,'' said Ajay Rajadhyaksha, head of United States fixed income strategy at Barclays Capital in New York. ''If investors around the world then start shunning Treasuries, diversifying away from the U.S. dollar, that will show up in higher yields'' -- and higher mortgage rates.
More near term, jittery buyers could pull back from the housing market. ''When people are fearful, it's never a good thing,'' said Ellen Bitton, president of Park Avenue Mortgage in Manhattan. ''Does it make somebody want to go out and spend $1 million on an apartment? I don't think so.''
Consumer confidence in general has taken a beating over recent months as high oil prices crimped purchasing power and uncertainty over the political wrangling caused people to defer big purchases.
In July, consumer confidence had already hit its lowest level since the beginning of 2009, when the country was still officially in the midst of a recession, according to the Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan index.
Whether the downgrade ultimately leads to the decline of the United States economy or is merely a symbolic turning point is impossible to tell. ''But if you picture a history book in 100 years with the timeline of China passing the U.S.,'' quipped Mr. Rogoff, ''one of the dates on the timeline will be 'U.S. debt downgraded.' ''

PERSON: M.H. Rindskopf, 

HEADLINE: M.H. Rindskopf,, 93, Dies; Submarine Commander

BYLINE: By DENNIS HEVESI

 BODY:
Rear Adm. Maurice H. Rindskopf, the youngest commander of an American fleet submarine during World War II who directed the sinking of 15 Japanese vessels, one of the highest totals in the war, died on July 27 at his home in Annapolis, Md. He was 93.
The cause was prostate cancer, said his granddaughter, Amy Rindskopf. 
Admiral Rindskopf was 26 when, as a lieutenant commander, he took over the U.S.S. Drum after its captain fell ill and had to undergo surgery. Fleet submarines like the Drum were, at that time, the Navy's top-of-the-line long-distance subs, built just before the war and during it. The Navy still had World War I-era submarines, but they were primarily used as patrol vessels.
The future admiral was an ensign when he was first assigned to the Drum in 1941 and was the officer in charge of torpedo targeting (and later executive officer) before being named commander in June 1942. In his three years aboard, he was directly involved in the firing of 125 torpedoes, leading to the confirmed sinking of 15 ships -- most of them cargo vessels -- with a total tonnage of more than 80,000. Of all the submarines in World War II, the Drum ranked No. 8 in confirmed tonnage sunk. Eleven other Japanese ships were damaged by the Drum.
''He basically ran the fire-control party for the entire time,'' James Scott, the author of ''The War Below,'' a soon-to-be-published book about America's submarine battles against Japan, said Friday. ''The submarine war was an economic war, and the Drum played a vital role in destroying Japan's ability to have the natural resources needed to prosecute the war.''
Admiral Rindskopf would receive the Navy Cross, the Silver Star and the Bronze Star for his wartime service. He later served as commander of two submarine flotillas and of the Navy's submarine school in New London, Conn. After being promoted to admiral in 1967, he was assistant chief of staff for intelligence to Adm. John S. McCain Jr., commander of the United States Pacific Command during the Vietnam War and father of Senator John McCain of Arizona.
Maurice Herbert Rindskopf was born in Jamaica, Queens, on Sept. 27, 1917, the only child of Herbert and Amy Baumgarten Rindskopf. After graduating at the top of his class from Poly Prep Country Day School in Brooklyn in 1934, at 16, he was accepted into the Naval Academy, where he was a star player on the lacrosse team. After retiring from the Navy in 1972, Admiral Rindskopf was a marketing manager for Westinghouse.
Besides his granddaughter, Amy, he is survived by two great-grandchildren. His wife of 69 years, the former Sylvia Lubow, died before him, as did his son, Peter.
Not all of the sinkings during then-Commander Rindskopf's time at the helm of the Drum were of large vessels.
On his first patrol as commander, the targets were two sampans -- small, flat-bottomed wooden boats -- that were being used as spy vessels off the islands of Palau. Using a torpedo would have been overkill, so they were sunk by gunfire.
''There were two survivors swimming in the ocean and rather than kill them, which he was authorized to do, he took them on board and put them to work in the kitchen,'' the admiral's granddaughter said. ''He said they ended up becoming very good cooks.''

HEADLINE: Supply, Demand And Marriage

BYLINE: By ROBERT H. FRANK. 
Robert H. Frank is an economics professor at the Johnson Graduate School of Management at Cornell University.

 BODY:
IN some cultures, romance isn't nearly as important as cash when it comes to choosing a marriage partner. And even when money plays no explicit role in selecting a mate, courtship customs are governed by the venerable economic model of supply and demand.
Under the dowry system in India, for example, parents of older brides would typically pay more to prospective grooms. Men with better jobs would receive larger payments, too. 
In short, there really is a marriage market in many countries around the world, and economic principles apply to it. In markets with a preponderance of women seeking partners, the terms of trade shift in favor of men. If more men are seeking partners, the reverse is true. Two cases in point are the baby-boom generation in the United States and the current youth cohort in China.
In the United States, the end of World War II and the return of millions of troops set off the baby boom. In the second half of the 1940s, the population swelled by almost 14 percent, versus growth of less than half of 1 percent during the first half of the decade. By the mid-1960s, many of those babies were reaching the traditional marriage age.
At the time, it was American custom for women to marry men several years older than themselves. In a typical wedding in 1969, for example, the bride might have been born in 1947 and the groom in 1943. Because of that custom, women at the leading edge of the baby boom confronted a significant shortfall of potential marriage partners.
Economics teaches us that when there is excess demand for a good, its price rises. According to this model, excess demand for grooms should have caused the terms of courtship to shift in favor of men.
Before the 1960s, cultural norms encouraged celibacy before marriage. The breakdown of those norms has been widely attributed to the introduction of oral contraception, which gave women an unintrusive way to protect themselves against an unwanted pregnancy. The pill no doubt played a role -- perhaps a very big one -- but skeptics object that effective alternative forms of contraception had long since been available.
The supply-and-demand model bolsters the skeptics' concerns. Biologists describe a fundamental asymmetry in the sexual strategies favored by males and females in vertebrate species. Males, whose sex cells are cheap to produce, tend to favor more transient sexual relationships, whereas females, for whom pregnancy and birth are far more costly, tend to favor greater commitment. The sexual revolution, which bent cultural norms toward male preferences, may thus be partly explained by the excess demand for grooms in the 1960s.
An imbalance in the opposite direction characterizes the contemporary marriage market in China. The Chinese government's one-child policy, combined with a cultural preference for sons and technologies that permit selective abortion, have helped to create a large sex-ratio imbalance among young Chinese. For every 100 women in that group, there are now more than 120 men.
According to market models, the terms of trade in the Chinese marriage market should have shifted sharply in favor of women. And evidence suggests that young Chinese women and their families have in fact become much more selective in recent years.
They appear, for example, to focus more critically on the earnings potential of prospective mates. Because house size is often assumed to be a reliable signal of wealth, a family can enhance its son's marriage prospects by spending a larger fraction of its income on housing. (Other families can follow the same strategy, of course, but when all families do so, the resulting homes are still reliable indicators of relative wealth.) Such a shift appears to have occurred.
For example, when Shang-Jin Wei, an economist at Columbia University, and Xiaobo Zhang of the International Food Policy Research Institute examined the size distribution of Chinese homes, they found that families with sons built houses that were significantly larger than those built by families with daughters, even after controlling for family income and other factors. They also generally found that the higher a city's male-to-female ratio, the bigger the average house size of families that have sons.
Mr. Wei reports that many families with sons have begun to add a phantom third story to their homes, one that looks normal from the outside but whose interior space remains completely unfinished.
''Marriage brokers are familiar with the tactic,'' he reports, ''yet many refuse to schedule meetings with a family's son unless the family house has three stories.''
Risk-taking among men is another marker of the terms of trade in marriage markets. Biologists have long argued that men's relative willingness to engage in risk is an evolutionary legacy of polygynous mating systems, those in which males with the most resources took more than one mate. That means males with the least resources were left with none -- the worst thing that could happen in Darwinian terms.
Fast-forward to humans today, and we can see why men may view financial risk-taking as a compelling strategy. Let's say a man who is single has a chance to invest his last $10,000 in a very risky business venture. If it succeeds, he gets $1 million and is much more successful socially in finding mates.
So even if the odds of success are small, it would be rational -- in Darwinian terms -- for him to make the investment, because he would fail for sure if he doesn't.
How is this showing up in China? Mr. Wei and Mr. Zhang find evidence that men are more likely to make risky financial investments in cities with higher male-to-female ratios. Their specific finding was that significantly more local businesses are started in such cities. This doesn't appear attributable to other factors, since cities' sex ratios seem to have no effect on the number of businesses started by foreigners.
The choice of a marriage partner is one of the most important decisions in life. It's clearly very different from choosing a car. Yet in many ways, it appears to obey a strikingly similar market logic.

HEADLINE: Q&A

BYLINE: By JAY ROMANO

 BODY:
An Inheritance and a Co-op Board
QMy elderly mother was remarried a couple of years ago to a man who owned a co-op in Manhattan. He recently died, and she inherited everything. But the co-op board insists that my mother's finances do not meet their requirements and that she must sell. Can they do this?
A Eva Talel, a Manhattan co-op and condominium lawyer, says the answer depends on the co-op's proprietary lease, and on whether consent to transfer to a surviving spouse requires board approval. According to Ms. Talel, when the owner of a co-op dies, a bequest in the owner's will gives the recipient ownership only of the economic value of the apartment, not the right to live in it or to have its shares transferred to his or her name. Most co-op proprietary leases, however, allow for a surviving spouse to take ownership and residency of an apartment without board approval. Some leases take a middle ground, by allowing a transfer to a ''financially responsible spouse or family member,'' with that determination being left to the board. 
Paying for Services Not Rendered
QI live in a market-rate rental apartment with floor-to-ceiling windows. Each month my rent bill includes a $20 surcharge for window cleaning. The rig used by the window washers has not worked for months. The windows are not being cleaned, but they keep including the surcharge. Management has ignored complaints. What can I do?
A ''The terms of a market-rate tenancy are governed by the lease,'' said David Ng, a Manhattan landlord-tenant lawyer. So if the lease specifically provides that the rent include a separate, identifiable charge for window cleaning, and no window cleaning is provided, the tenant should not have to pay the charge. However, Mr. Ng said, the costs involved in pursuing a refund of these charges are likely to exceed the refund itself. Mr. Ng notes that the lease may contain a provision that the loser pay the winner's lawyer fees. Moreover, if the writer can band together with other tenants, they may be able to share the costs, and risks, of litigation. The writer can sue in small claims court without having to hire a lawyer, or withhold the surcharge from the rent and then use the failure to clean the windows as a defense to any court action the landlord starts.
A New Buyer, an Old Project
QLast May, I bought a condominium in Manhattan. In July, I received a letter from the board stating that it had not raised enough money for a planned maintenance project. As a result, the members wrote, they were imposing a special assessment retroactively for January to July. Do I have to pay, even though I did not own the apartment then?
A Dennis H. Greenstein, a Manhattan co-op and condo lawyer, says the board's authority to impose a special assessment is controlled by the condo's bylaws. He adds that while it is unlikely the bylaws would permit a ''retroactive'' special assessment, they do allow a board to impose an assessment upon present unit owners to make up for a deficit in the funds needed for a project. So regardless of what time period the new assessment covers, when the work was done, or when the initial assessment was deemed insufficient, it is likely that the board can require the writer to contribute.

HEADLINE: Experience Reshapes A Designer

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE ROSENBLOOM

 BODY:
IT was the business equivalent of a blind date.
On a February afternoon in 2010, Andrew Rosen, a founder of Theory, and the Belgian designer Olivier Theyskens met for lunch at Macelleria, a rustic Italian restaurant a few cobblestones away from Theory's offices in the meatpacking district.
On the surface, the two men were an unlikely pairing. One was a blunt-speaking, hard-charging New Yorker who got his start in his family's retailing business three decades earlier and who had built a fashion empire on the principle that clothes could be both practical and stylish. The other was an ethereal, almost waiflike presence whose three previous attempts to create a luxury line (once under his own name, then successively for the venerable European houses Rochas and Nina Ricci) had foundered despite ample critical acclaim.
Steven Kolb, the chief executive of the Council of Fashion Designers of America, was largely responsible for this face-to-face meeting. Acting as a sort of matchmaker, Mr. Kolb had sent Mr. Rosen an e-mail last year at the request of Mr. Theyskens's lawyers, whom he knew through the council. Mr. Theyskens was interested in starting his own line, and he wanted Mr. Rosen's support. 
Mr. Rosen was known in the industry for providing crucial backing for up-and-coming brands like Rag & Bone, Alice + Olivia and Gryphon, as well as helping to revitalize the Helmut Lang brand.
But Mr. Rosen had other ideas, none of which included setting up Mr. Theyskens in his own business. As Mr. Rosen explained in an interview in his office this spring, ''Starting a business today from scratch is a very complicated thing, and to do something on the scale that Olivier would be happy with would be a very expensive proposition.''
Moreover, Mr. Rosen was not shopping for a star designer. But he was on a mission to grow the Theory brand beyond its current markets in the United States and Japan. Bringing in a celebrated international designer like Mr. Theyskens might very well help that cause and give the brand some fresh energy.
So after lunch, as the two men strolled into the nearby Theory flagship, Mr. Rosen suggested that rather than start his own line, Mr. Theyskens design one for Theory.
Mr. Theyskens was intrigued. He had already calculated that it would be impossible to forge a new business with fewer than 30 people, including those with expertise in sales and the contemporary market. Theory already had the staff and expertise. ''You always want to start things,'' Mr. Theyskens said, ''but you want to measure the risk.'' Working with a retailing veteran like Mr. Rosen would help him do just that.
In May 2010, it was announced that Mr. Theyskens would design a new line: Theyskens' Theory. Five months after that -- before the first collection was even in stores, and thus still an unknown in terms of its commercial viability -- Mr. Theyskens was also named artistic director of the entire Theory brand, which is owned by Japan's Fast Retailing.
In an interview with The New York Times, Mr. Rosen was asked whether the seemingly sudden decision to hand over creative control of Theory to the young designer was a risky move. ''To me, it's not a risk,'' he said. ''I know Olivier, and I know his understanding of Theory. I think it's a great opportunity. I didn't need a reaction from the consumer on Theyskens' Theory. It's amazing clothes that will get an amazing response.''
Looking back, Mr. Rosen acknowledged that the series of developments that led from that lunch to this current partnership came somewhat as a surprise to him and to Mr. Theyskens: ''I don't think he was ever thinking that, oh, one day he was going to become the artistic director of Theory.''
ANDREW ROSEN grew up as a garmento. Born in Dedham, Mass., he followed his grandfather and his father into the retailing business when he joined the family-owned Puritan Fashions in 1977. Under his father, Carl Rosen, Puritan, which had been founded in Boston in 1907, grew from a regional dressmaking company into a multimillion-dollar conglomerate by developing licenses with designers like Calvin Klein and Diane Von Furstenberg.
In 1983, when Carl Rosen died of cancer, Andrew took over the business. Later that year, Calvin Klein and his business partner Barry Schwartz succeeded in a takeover bid for Puritan. In 1989, Mr. Rosen left to become president of Anne Klein.
Then in 1997, after two decades of shepherding contemporary brands founded by other people, Mr. Rosen teamed with the designer Elie Tahari to create a new brand: Theory. The label garnered fans with its minimalist, stretchy work basics, and it became a major success. By 2003, Theory's American and Japanese businesses were producing more than $200 million in sales a year.
That year, Mr. Rosen and Mr. Tahari sold Theory to two Japanese firms, Link International and Fast Retailing. Mr. Tahari continues to lead the Elie Tahari label, founded in the 1970s. Mr. Rosen is co-chief executive of Theory and Helmut Lang.
Retailing executives describe Mr. Rosen as a tough negotiator, unafraid to adopt a ''my way or no-way'' stance. They say he is passionate, aggressive, at times irreverent. As demonstrated by his early support for Rag & Bone and Alice + Olivia, he also has a keen eye for rising talent. A little more than a week ago, he and a partner, John Howard, took a stake in Proenza Schouler in a deal seen as an important career move for the company's young designers, Jack McCollough and Lazaro Hernandez.
''He's not driven by the balance sheet,'' Simon Collins, the dean of fashion at Parsons the New School for Design, said of Mr. Rosen. ''Normally someone at his level is all about business and board meetings, and he's not. He goes to all the shows, and he's always got time for the school as well, which is very refreshing.''
FROM the beginning, ever since emerging from the Brussels design school, Ecole Nationale Superieure des Arts Visuels de la Cambre, in 1997, Olivier Theyskens was seen as a talent to watch.
A year later, Madonna wore a black satin coat dress designed by Mr. Theyskens, then 21, to the Oscars. In the years to come, movie stars like Nicole Kidman and Reese Witherspoon would don his moody Edwardian designs. Vogue and its editor, Anna Wintour, were champions, and his clothes were often featured in the magazine.
Mr. Theyskens had his own line from 1997 until 2001, when his financial backer pulled out. A year later, he was named artistic director of Rochas. But in 2006, Procter & Gamble decided to close the luxury French fashion house after determining it was not compatible with the rest of its businesses. (It was later revived by another owner.)
Once again Mr. Theyskens was out of a job. That summer, he won the Council of Fashion Designers of America's International Award for his work at Rochas, and then became the artistic director of another French house, Nina Ricci. He lasted a little more than two years before being dismissed by Nina Ricci's parent company, Puig, in March 2009, seven months before the expiration of his contract.
In the April issue of Vogue that year, Ms. Wintour wrote that his departure from Nina Ricci suggested ''that the vital role of artistic talent has been obscured in the current economic climate. My staff and I were shocked to learn that Theyskens's contract would not be renewed.''
Despite a growing reputation, deserved or not, that Mr. Theyskens was intent on designing clothes that were too expensive to produce commercially, the designer told Mr. Rosen at their Macelleria lunch that he wanted to make more affordable, accessible clothes.
Mr. Theyskens elaborated on that ambition one rainy afternoon in May from atop a divan in his studio near Theory's offices. ''I've always believed that shape is something that has no price,'' he said, wearing a long-sleeved black shirt, maroon corduroy pants for Theory and untied black velvet Dr. Martens. He would occasionally kick them off and expose the maroon lining, which delighted him because it matched his pants. ''It's just a shape,'' he continued, ''the way it's cut.''
The emphasis of Theyskens' Theory is on wardrobe essentials. ''I can do just the cleanest black pant,'' Mr. Theyskens said, almost buoyant. While that may sound very different from designing ball gowns, ''it's not that different,'' he said, noting that his first collection in the 1990s had simple tailoring. ''Since Day One,'' Mr. Theyskens said, many of his designs have been ''more discreet.''
He is not surprised, though, that he's been labeled a ''demi-couturier.'' He likens it to the way people talk about artists: they will say they know a painter because they've seen his masterpieces, even though they might not know the entire oeuvre. ''We always see the point of an iceberg,'' he said. ''So I've always accepted the idea that people -- they don't necessarily know everything I am.''
The Theyskens' Theory line seems to back up his words. ''I've sat through years of runway shows and seeing the Theyskens' Theory show, you knew they hit something that is unique and is filling a void in the market,'' said Robert Burke, a luxury consultant and a former senior vice president of fashion for Bergdorf Goodman. ''It had a real designer point of view. And a designer point of view doesn't mean it has to cost $3-, $4-, $5,000.''
Mr. Theyskens's fall 2011 collection for Theyskens' Theory was shown in February at New York Fashion Week. The raw space in Chelsea was jammed, and the reviews were largely favorable.
Some pieces were enormously commercial, like boot-cut corduroy jeans, cable-knit sweaters and denim short-shorts. ''And if you think teeny tiny shorts aren't commercial,'' wrote Eric Wilson of The New York Times, ''take a look at the racks of Abercrombie & Fitch.''
That fall collection has begun arriving at upscale department stores and at Theory's own outlets. It is the first time that Mr. Theyskens's influence can be seen not only in his own collection (slouchy flare-leg pants, $295, and wool blazers with Mr. Theyskens's signature V cut-out at the nape of the neck, $595) but also in the mainline Theory collection. Prices for the latter are not much different, like a $435 chunky angora women's sweater and $195 stretch corduroy pants for men.
Mr. Rosen said that he did not want to put constraints on Mr. Theyskens's design process, but that he did want Mr. Theyskens to know how his clothes are selling. ''We want Olivier to understand that a lot of what he's doing is working but some things aren't,'' he said.
Mr. Theyskens said he was enjoying the learning process. For instance, he found out that his debut Theyskens' Theory collection was nearly bought in its entirety. ''It's the first time ever,'' he said, referring to the fact that when he designed his ready-to-wear collection, buyers for upscale department stores would usually order only his sumptuous dresses, not his everyday basics.
WILL Mr. Theyskens find in Theory that sustained commercial success that has so far eluded him?
The conventional wisdom and the reviews point toward a yes. ''It's great for his career to be doing this because the contemporary market has been such a major market for the past few years,'' said Virginia Smith, the fashion market and accessories director at Vogue.
Those who know Mr. Theyskens, 34, use words like ''impassioned'' and ''sensitive'' to describe him, but they also suggest there is a steeliness that may not be apparent when you first meet the soft-spoken, somewhat shy Belgian.
''He's almost childlike in a way,'' Ms. Smith said. ''There's a certain naivete that comes across with Olivier. He looks like a beautiful boy. But I think underneath that is a very focused man.''
''One time in going to see him, I think this was at Rochas, he was showing me sketches of the collection,'' she continued. ''It was almost like paper doll sketches of every single look that ended up going into the show. He had his whole show in his head. It's just an incredible showing of how focused and how clear he was on what he wanted.''
Mr. Theyskens describes himself as a ''passionate guy,'' though he takes pleasure in testing his discipline. For example, he stopped sketching to music at one point because he feared he was becoming dependent on it. ''I just challenged myself and said 'No, you do it with no music,' '' he said.
He said he stopped smoking after counting the number of minutes he was losing ''doing nothing'' during smoke breaks. Whenever he is stuck in an airport, he reminds himself: ''Do not stress. It's still a 10th of the time you would need if you were going by boat.''
Julie Gilhart, a fashion consultant and former fashion director of Barneys New York who has known Mr. Theyskens since he was 19, said, ''He knows how to manage his mind.''
''He's shy and quiet,'' she said, ''but he's very confident.''
When asked how he feels before a runway show, Mr. Theyskens said matter-of-factly, ''I've never been nervous.''
Ms. Gilhart called the pairing of Mr. Theyskens and Mr. Rosen ''genius,'' yet she never expected the designer to land at Theory, let alone in Manhattan: ''To me, Paris is the mother lode of design.''
But Mr. Theyskens did move, and living here is changing how he works. His design process, for instance, is less formal. He has come to prefer the people, the social scene, even the food. (His face lighted up in describing how one can find almost any kind of pizza, even without cheese.) The city's energy, pace and post-work cocktail culture is a welcome change. ''I'm definitely more awake here than in Paris,'' Mr. Theyskens said.
Paris, he said, is a lonelier place.
After living there a few years, he began to wonder, ''How come I never saw more than two Parisian apartments?'' He said he randomly met the friends he had there. ''I decided one day to have tea on the terrace and by sort of par l'hasard,'' he said, using the French phrase for ''by chance,'' ''that lonely person, we started talking and we became friends. It happens like, maybe, once in a year. And it's maybe the only few friends I have. It's really strange.''
New York felt warmer. ''I was sometimes a bit sad that I would come here so often and always be in a hotel,'' he said, as his collaborators flitted in and out of the Little West 12th Street studio (the ''aquarium'' as Mr. Theyskens referred to it in his playful tone). He spends many afternoons in the light of its soaring windows, draping clothes, a process that is often meditative for him.
He had hoped ''that maybe one day I would have an apartment in the city.'' His voice trailed off. He smiled, adding: ''It came quicker than I thought.''

HEADLINE: China Strongly Condemns U.S. 'Addiction to Debts'

BYLINE: By DAVID BARBOZA; Hiroko Tabuchi contributed reporting from Tokyo.

 BODY:
SHANGHAI -- China, the largest foreign holder of United States debt, said Saturday that Washington needed to ''cure its addiction to debts'' and ''live within its means,'' just hours after the rating agency Standard & Poor's downgraded America's long-term debt.
The harshly worded commentary, released by China's official Xinhua news agency, was Beijing's latest effort to express its displeasure with Washington. 
Beijing's reaction to the downgrade was the harshest among foreign leaders. Japan -- which held $882 billion in United States Treasuries at the end of last year, making it the second-biggest overseas holder of American debt -- did not release any official statement about the downgrade. A Finance Ministry official said he could not comment.
Though Beijing has few options other than to continue to buy United States Treasury bonds, Chinese officials are clearly concerned that the country's substantial holdings of American debt, worth at least $1.1 trillion, are being devalued.
''The U.S. government has to come to terms with the painful fact that the good old days when it could just borrow its way out of messes of its own making are finally gone,'' read the commentary, which was published in Chinese newspapers.
Beijing, which did not release any other official statement on the downgrade, called on Washington to make substantial cuts to its ''gigantic military expenditure'' and its ''bloated social welfare'' programs.
The commentary serves as a sharp illustration of how the United States' standing in the world is sliding and how China now views itself as ascendant.
While Washington wrangles over its debt and deficit problems and the European Union struggles to deal with its own debt issues, China is sitting on the world's largest foreign exchange holdings, and its economy is growing at close to 9 percent. The country is also once again racking up huge trade surpluses with the rest of the world.
Beijing does have its own worries, like soaring inflation and housing prices and an overheating economy. Policy makers are also trying to deal with the accumulation of huge foreign exchange holdings. Trade and current account surpluses have helped China accumulate the vast foreign exchange reserves. It has invested much of those reserves in United States Treasury bonds, largely because the American market has long been considered the safest and most liquid bond market in the world.
Analysts say that China can also buy bonds in the European and Japanese markets but that those two markets are not big or liquid enough to absorb China's fast-accumulating foreign exchange reserves.
But because China has about $3 trillion in foreign exchange reserves, there are few places big enough to invest those holdings safely outside of United States Treasuries, even though it looks as if they may lose value.
Analysts say that if China pulled back from buying Treasuries, the dollar would weaken and America's borrowing costs would rise sharply, but that would also hurt China's existing holdings.
And so until China can find a way to slow its accumulation of dollars or find alternatives, it is likely to be the largest buyer of Treasuries. Still, government leaders here increasingly sound as if they are losing confidence.
''International supervision over the issue of U.S. dollars should be introduced, and a new stable and secured global reserve currency may also be an option to avert a catastrophe caused by any single country,'' the Xinhua commentary said.
Japanese officials in recent weeks had voiced some concern over Washington's debt impasse and its effect on the global economy. Still, trade-driven Japan is more than ever lured to holding Treasuries as a way to weaken its currency and make its exports more competitive. This week, Japan started what one economist estimated to be a 4.5 trillion yen intervention to buy dollars and sell yen. Data is expected to show that Japan's holdings of Treasuries have increased.
Meanwhile, Japan is struggling with its own burgeoning debt, already twice the size of its $5 trillion economy. Standard & Poor's in January downgraded Japan's sovereign debt rating to AA-, two notches lower than the newly downgraded AA+ rating held by American securities. The markets shrugged off the downgrade, however, and Japan maintains low long-term interest rates.

HEADLINE: This Time, Corporate Profits May Not Save the Day

BYLINE: By PAUL J. LIM. 
Paul J. Lim is a senior editor at Money magazine. E-mail: fund@nytimes.com

 BODY:
U NTIL recently, investors had been holding out some hope for the economy because of the surprising health of corporate earnings.
But after the Dow Jones industrial average plummeted nearly 700 points last week -- pushing stocks down 11 percent from their late April peak -- Wall Street investors are finally waking up to what Main Street households have known all along: The already bad economy is getting worse. And the laundry list of problems that could tip the economy into another severe downturn, if not a recession, is growing only longer.
First, there's the debt-ceiling debate in Washington, which isn't over yet as a special Congressional panel will try to find $1.5 trillion in additional savings by November. On top of that, there are the still-growing debt problems in Europe. 
''There's a growing sense the Continent is in denial and investors will continue to stress those markets until something gives,'' said Jack A. Ablin, executive vice president and chief investment officer at Harris Private Bank. ''Bailouts don't appear to be cutting it.''
And, on another front, it remains to be seen whether the Federal Reserve will step up again to try to stimulate the economy, as it did last November when it started to buy Treasury securities in hopes of keeping interest rates low.
Just about the only bright note has been corporate earnings. Profit among companies in the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index are thought to have grown 18 percent, on average, in the second quarter versus the year-ago period, according to figures tracked by Capital IQ. That's an increase from July expectations for profit growth of around 12 percent. The new figure stands in stark contrast to government reports showing that economic growth slowed drastically in the first half of the year.
''But earnings and earnings revisions are a lagging indicator,'' said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at S.& P. Equity Research. Historically, he noted, corporate profits don't reach a trough until around nine months after a bear market ends. And they typically don't peak until after a bull market runs its course.
Does that mean that this bull run, which began in March 2009, may be over?
It's hard to say. To enter another bear market, the Dow would have to tumble a further 1,200 points or so. Then again, after days like last Thursday, when the Dow fell by more than 512 points, that might not be so far off.
ALL that is certain is that Wall Street's take on profits seems to have done a 180-degree turn. Where once investors were looking at earnings as a way to gauge the health of the underlying economy, they're now using the bad economic news to gauge when profits will drop, said Ben Inker, head of asset allocation at GMO, the asset management firm.
It seems as if ''the weight of ugly economic data is causing people to worry about the sustainability of the growth we've had so far,'' Mr. Inker said.
So far, there have been only slight revisions to third-quarter profit growth, said John Butters, senior earnings analyst at FactSet.
As of Friday, the consensus forecast was that the S.& P. 500's earnings would grow 15.8 percent in the third quarter. That's off slightly from predictions of 16.7 percent third-quarter growth at the end of June, Mr. Butters said.
Jeffrey N. Kleintop, chief market strategist at LPL Financial, says he thinks that ''the estimates are still too high.'' While profits might still grow by double digits, he said, they won't be the 16 or 17 percent gains built into many analysts' estimates.
In the best-case situation, he said, one reason for slowing profit growth will be that margins may decline as some companies ramp up hiring.
The worst-case event, of course, is that the economy will worsen significantly, cutting into both sales and profits.
Michael Thompson, managing director for S.& P. Valuation and Risk Strategies, which oversees Capital IQ, says there is no evidence yet that this worst-case scenario is working its way into the estimates.
But market strategists say it may take some time for bad domestic economic news to work its way into profit figures, simply because of the nature of the S.& P. 500. For one thing, the index tracks large, globally oriented companies that generate nearly half of their sales and profits abroad.
And Mr. Thompson added that historically, ''analysts have never been good at identifying the inflection points in the economy''-- for instance, when recessions turn into expansions and vice versa.
So if the economy is indeed headed south, all bets are off when it comes to profits.

HEADLINE: A Move That Echoes the Nervousness of Global Markets

BYLINE: By BINYAMIN APPELBAUM

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The Standard & Poor's decision to downgrade the credit rating of the United States for the first time echoed the nervousness of global markets in recent weeks, driven down by the relentless beat of grim economic news and a loss of confidence in the ability of political leaders to navigate challenges.
Governments on both sides of the Atlantic have avoided grappling with fundamental problems, counting on renewed growth to help borrowers who cannot afford to pay and creditors who cannot afford to walk away. 
But four years into this age of financial contagion, the global economy cannot seem to pick up steam. Every promising leap seems to end with a sickening thud. The easy answers are exhausted, and political leaders face a rising tide of anger that is constraining their ability to make more difficult choices.
S.&P. said Friday that it was losing faith in America's political leaders. Investors seem to be losing hope. The movements of markets are collective predictions of future prosperity, and the tidings are increasingly grim.
''Europe's plan was to have growth fix the problem. America's plan was to have growth fix the problem. And that's not going to work,'' said Kenneth Rogoff, an economics professor at Harvard. ''I think it's really starting to sink in that we're not anywhere near an endgame.''
The United States and Europe face parallel debt problems. Here, banks and investors are pitted against homeowners. There, banks and investors are pitted against nations. In both cases, governments have struggled to rebalance their books.
There is no surplus of economic strength to throw at the problem. The United States and Europe ran up great debts in the years of plenty, living well and promising to pay later, even as they made expansive promises to aging populations.
''The restorative forces of the economy are very weak and the immediate forces that will be in place are worsening the problem,'' said Joseph E. Stiglitz, an economist at Columbia University. ''We already know it's not going to be a V-shaped recovery. I had said in my book that it would be more of an L-shaped, slow recovery. I think the answer now is a Japan-style malaise.''
The weakness of the American economy is most evident in the lack of jobs. Only 55 percent of working-age adults held full-time jobs in July, the lowest level in modern times. About 25 million American adults want but cannot find full-time work, the government said Friday. The unemployment rate fell slightly, but mostly because 193,000 people stopped searching for jobs.
Consumer spending makes up 70 percent of the nation's economic activity, and people without jobs spend less money. For more than a year the government has reported that the economy was expanding more quickly than employment, fueling hope that hiring would follow.
But last week the government said in a new estimate that it was mistaken, and that the economy actually had expanded at an annual rate of only 0.8 percent during the first half of the year -- about the rate of population growth.
Falling home prices also shadow the recovery. Total household wealth remains 12 percent below its prerecession peak, according to the Federal Reserve. Consumer spending has not suffered a comparable decline, suggesting that people still see brighter days ahead. If they are wrong or if they lose faith, economists say, spending could dip even more sharply -- and with it, the broader economy.
Corporate profits have climbed to record heights, but companies are not hiring. Long-term prosperity depends on investment in research and equipment and workers. But short-term fears are driving a turn toward austerity, said Gary P. Pisano, a professor at Harvard Business School.
''The dynamic that our government has gotten trapped in, companies are trapped in as well,'' he said.
Professor Stiglitz said that falling stock prices could exacerbate the problem.
''Firms with stock prices in decline will be reinvigorated to cut costs,'' he said. ''And what does that mean? Lowering wages and firing people and making people work harder.''
Financial markets have also been slow to recover. A lack of confidence in the reported health of financial institutions is visible in the price of their shares. Bank of America closed Friday at $8.17, implying that investors believe the company is worth about $83 billion. Bank of America estimated its own value at roughly $206 billion at the end of June.
There are no easy solutions. Professor Rogoff, who studies the aftermath of financial crises, has written that recoveries tend to take a very long time, particularly when downturns are as long and as deep as this one has been. The only way to hasten the process, he said, is to force the transfer of wealth from creditors to debtors -- to rebalance the books. He argues that this could be done through a policy of tolerance for higher inflation, which would reduce the value of debts over time.
''People sometimes ask, 'What is the checklist of things that have to happen for a recovery?' '' he said. ''I think there's basically one thing on it -- improving the balance sheets.''
Lawrence H. Summers, President Obama's former chief economic adviser who has returned to his previous role as a professor at Harvard, said that exacting a toll from creditors could constrain future growth by discouraging future investments.
''No one is satisfied with the efforts to reduce foreclosures and support the housing market,'' he said. ''The barrier to doing more has not been ideology or any solicitude for the financial sector, but concern about the adverse effects of inducing nonpayment by homeowners or reducing the flow of new mortgage credit.''
Mr. Summers argues instead that the government should focus on tax cuts and directed spending to stimulate private spending and investment, policies for which there is little political appetite.
But even such measures, he said, have only a limited effect.
Ultimately, he said, crises are caused by too much confidence, too much borrowing and too much spending -- and the irony is that they must be solved by more confidence, more borrowing and more spending.

HEADLINE: Where to Get the World's Best Service

BYLINE: By NATE SILVER

 BODY:
The guidebooks tell you never to tip in Japan. But when my partner and I traveled there last December, and our 90-pound bellhop insisted on carrying our overstuffed suitcases to our room, we thought a few hundred yen was more than appropriate. She politely refused our money. And over the course of the next week, so did the hotel clerks who equipped us with umbrellas at the first sign of drizzle, the concierges who booked us tables at mind-blowing sushi restaurants too off the grid to be listed on the Internet and the restaurant owners who presented us with a souvenir menu -- in English -- to commemorate all the delicious food we had just eaten. No tipping meant no tipping, period. 
This hard-line stance raised a question: do you get better service in countries where gratuity isn't expected, or is Japan unique? The answer is a little bit complicated and involves something I call the Tipping Curve.
Last month, I polled 400 experienced international travelers about the levels of service they experienced in 24 countries and how much they tipped when they dined out in each one. In terms of service, Japan won in a landslide -- it scored 4.4 points on average on a 5-point scale -- while Russia came in dead last, with a paltry 1.7 points.
To figure out what constitutes generally accepted tipping practices, I built a ''tipping index'' from a combination of the survey responses and the guidance of three travel etiquette Web sites. I discovered that countries sort themselves into one of three groups: those where reasonably large tips are a part of the culture, those where tipping is uncommon and those that fall somewhere in between.
The countries that received the highest grades for customer service tended to cluster at either end of the spectrum. In Japan and Thailand, tipping is rare, but the service is regarded as excellent. The most tip-friendly countries -- the United States and Canada -- also received above-average marks for service.
Most European nations (Germany being the exception) scored below average. Places like France, Spain and Italy often append a service charge to the bill -- but what you tip on top of that is an open question. About one-third of visitors to France said they left no more than pocket change for their garcon, while another quarter of the people tipped at least 15 percent for decent service.
There are also weird cases like Russia, where a tip is expected of a foreigner but not always of a native, and Egypt, where tipping is common but often at a flat rate rather than as a percentage of the bill.
All of this brings us to the Tipping Curve. If servers expect a generous gratuity, there is a strong economic incentive for them to do superior work. And if they expect nothing at all, good service is taken completely out of the economic context and becomes a matter of custom. But when countries try to split the difference or if they introduce confusing rules into the system, their servers are more likely to leave customers dissatisfied.

HEADLINE: Have You Picnicked At the Tank Farm?

BYLINE: By FRANCIS X. CLINES

 BODY:
Back when colonial New Yorkers first sweltered in their budding city, one peppercorn per year was the bargain fee negotiated for renting Gotham's first official park, Bowling Green, in 1733. There were grandiose municipal plans to add grass, trees and a wooden fence ''for the Recreation and Delight of the Inhabitants of this City.''
That ethos still resides in the city's 1,700 parks, encompassing 29,000 acres. The parks department's recession-era budget is down to $313 million this year. But it is still building with a $1.6 billion capital fund. The glories of Central Park and Prospect Park and a dozen others are familiar, but there are sundry coves, forests and archipelagoes to be discovered by all sweltering through these hard times. Here is a look at three of the system's lesser-known delights: 
Elmhurst Park
For decades, this six-acre tract -- the city's newest park -- was the site of two massive red and white natural gas tanks, hulking eyesores that Long Island Expressway commuters used as landmarks. The site's owners had big plans to sell the land for millions to Home Depot or some other big-box stores. Neighborhood groups rallied and protested and eventually got them to turn it over to the city for $1 (only slightly more than a peppercorn). More than 600 new trees have been planted. ''Shade will come; give us 15 years or so,'' a park attendant named Carlos politely informs visitors. A few families of picnickers tuck optimistically into the skimpy shade.
Futuristic playground equipment picks up the energy theme. Children pedal furiously on stationary bikes to generate light on a facing column. A few faux hillocks invite meanderers and skateboarders. Carlos wags his finger to signal that bike riding is forbidden, and a cyclist in full Alpine costume dismounts as if lost on his way to some mountain.
Muskrat Cove
At the northern edge of the Bronx lies perhaps the city's humblest park, just several winding blocks long. Getting there requires descending a paved path from street level, beyond Ralph's B Auto Repair, to a graffiti-splashed underpass. The route screams: Beware grinding city! But then it yields to the serenity of a tree-shrouded river, with strollers wandering in silence. The lush greenery is pruned and tended by local residents, who can tell you about jewelweed, white pine, brown bats and muskrats too, in eco-savvy Bronx accents.
The smell of fresh water takes over as tree canopies fend off the car exhaust wafting from the roads above. You can walk to the city limits and along the way pause at a copse of ash trees that is a simple memorial to 9/11 victims. Muskrat Cove is the topmost portion of an ambitious plan that's fortifying a dozen parks along the 23-mile greenway defined by the Bronx River. Downstream, authentic salt marshes are being restored along a blighted factory site now poetically renamed Concrete Plant Park.
Alley Pond Park
Alley Pond is a sleeper in eastern Queens, 655 acres, crisscrossed by highways that overlook ice-age kettle ponds. Staking out corners of the park are horseback riders, birders, overnight campers and rope-climbers. A 2.5-mile bikeway was once part of William Vanderbilt's privately run Long Island Motor Parkway, the millionaire's early auto-era conceit.
A young girl hurries past with a tennis racket and a violin, ready to play something. Tavern league softball teams swing metal bats and beer bellies. The sweet sound of a peewee-league coach delivering baseball cliches to his players is a particular pleasure: ''Now, you played hard, and I know your parents want to know that, but next time I know you'll play harder and we'll win, right?''
Wait -- is that sound the ''cheer, cheerful, charmer'' song of the Eastern bluebird? That this hard-to-spot species is bred in the park is a revelation to someone from faraway Manhattan who has spent too much time contemplating Pale Male wannabes and the sparrows nesting raucously in the stanchions of city lights.

HEADLINE: Wall Street's Tax on Main Street

BYLINE: By GRETCHEN MORGENSON

 BODY:
AMID all the talk of debt and default in Washington last week, tiny Central Falls, R.I., went bankrupt.
Like many states and cities in these hard economic times, Central Falls -- population: 19,000 -- was caught short by hefty pension obligations and weak tax revenue. It may not be the last municipality to file for bankruptcy. Jefferson County, Ala., is now on the brink of it, thanks to a sewer bond issue gone wildly bad.
But while pensions and the economy are behind many of municipalities' troubles, Wall Street has played a role, too. Hidden expenses associated with how local governments finance themselves are compounding financial problems down at city hall.
Wall Street banks have peddled to municipalities all sorts of financial products, some of which have turned out to be costly mistakes. Testifying on July 29 at a public hearing on municipal securities sponsored by the Securities and Exchange Commission, Andrew Kalotay, an expert in financial derivatives who runs a debt management advisory firm in New York, asserted that poorly structured financial transactions involving bonds and derivatives known as interest rate swaps represented ''Wall Street's multibillion-dollar hidden tax on Main Street.'' 
Mr. Kalotay is talking about a type of complex financing that big banks have pushed on state and local authorities in recent years. The arrangements are typically made when borrowers want to exchange variable-rate debt for fixed-rate obligations.
These deals are lucrative for the banks, but many of the issuers don't seem to understand them. Mr. Kalotay told the S.E.C. that excessive fees charged by banks had cost issuers, and therefore taxpayers, $20 billion over the last five years. Real money, in other words, that could have been used in other ways by states and towns short on cash.
There's much for banks to love about these deals. Because there is no central market for interest rate swaps, prices of swaps are shrouded in secrecy. Banks can mark up costs significantly, often without their clients' knowledge.
Banks offering such deals can act as both adviser and counterparty to borrowers, putting the banks in direct conflict with their customers. And under agreements governing many of these swaps, borrowers that want to unwind these deals must go back to the banks that created them, putting the issuers at a disadvantage.
The costs of unwinding swaps can be onerous. Banks justify their fees by saying they are exposed to credit risk. But Mr. Kalotay asked, ''What is the justification for a high margin on unwinding, when credit risk is nonexistent?''
Another plus for the banks is that they book immediately the entire amount earned over the life of the swap; salespeople working on the deals receive bonuses -- typically 10 percent -- on these windfalls.
Alexander T. Arapoglou, a professor at the Kenan-Flagler Business School of the University of North Carolina, says states and cities often pay too much and don't get what they bargained for. ''Very often, swaps are sold to a customer who sees the bank as a financial adviser,'' Professor Arapoglou says. ''They are expecting a charge of some sort but expect it to be relatively modest.''
Marketing materials for these deals often say interest rate swaps will be executed at prevailing market prices, he says. But when the deals are about to close, additional costs typically appear. ''Many banks say that what's defined by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority as fair market practice, such as rules prohibiting excessive markups, does not apply to interest rate swaps,'' he says.
As banks have become more risk-averse, debt financings containing swaps have become more common. Unwilling to take on interest rate risk, banks often make borrowers finance operations with variable-rate debt. Borrowers that prefer the predictability of fixed-rate debt have to take on a swap.
Municipalities aren't the only ones being harmed. Small-business owners are overpaying as well. Consider what happened to Boca Raton Medical and Surgical Specialists, a Florida company that did a $21 million, five-year financing with Wachovia Bank in late 2005.
The deal financed an 80,000-square-foot office complex. But a lawyer for the company says its officials did not realize at the time that Wachovia had incorporated a 25-year interest rate swap into the transaction. This meant that the Boca Raton company would end up paying for a swap with a life five times as long as its financing.
Now the medical company is trying to unwind the deal. It has asked Wells Fargo, which acquired Wachovia in 2008, to return some of the money it paid to put on the swap. Wells has refused.
''We're in effect trapped with what we have because of the size of the unwind fees,'' says David Menkhaus, the lawyer at Moore & Menkhaus who represents Boca Raton Medical and Surgical Specialists. ''The industry portrays swaps as if it is an established market with consistent rates. That's not true, but you only find out when you are trying to unwind a swap.''
Greg Warren, managing member of Swap Negotiators, a firm in Winter Park, Fla., that represents borrowers in such transactions, calculated that the Boca Raton deal contained $800,000 in undisclosed fees, equal to roughly 3.8 percent of the loan. Another independent company confirmed this amount.
''The bank has a reason to make a profit -- they have to cover their risk,'' Mr. Warren says. ''But in this situation they had already covered their risk many times over.''
A Wells Fargo spokeswoman declined to talk about specific borrowers. Noting that the bank is among the smaller players in this arena, she said the bank still worked hard ''to ensure our customers fully understand the transactions.''
SOME borrowers are questioning the cost of swaps and persuading lenders to reduce them. Wells Fargo, for instance, agreed to cut its price in a recent $10.4 million financing for Hillcrest Convalescent Center in Durham, N.C. Fees associated with the transaction were initially around $200,000, but after Hillcrest asked Swap Negotiators to vet the deal, Wells agreed to reduce its fees. Hillcrest saved $93,000, net of Swap Negotiators' fees. Mr. Warren says his company charges 0.04 to 0.09 percent on a new transaction, and 0.02 percent when a swap is unwound.
Ted Smith, Hillcrest's administrator, says, ''It turned out to be a great business decision.''
Mr. Warren says unseen fees on such deals can be 1 to 5 percent of the loan. ''The size of the hidden profits relative to the loan amounts is disproportionate to any other negotiated fee,'' he says.
It is easy to see why big banks want to keep swap prices in the shadows. Until transparency comes to this arena, buyer beware.

ENRIONE--Robert Ugo Bob. February 5, 1947 June 28, 2011. Robert Ugo Bob Enrione, a veteran of the United States Navy, an Emmy award-winning video journalist, and a longtime resident of Tarrytown, NY, died suddenly on June 28, 2011, while he and his wife were visiting family in Virginia. He was 64 years old. 
Born on February 5, 1947, in Astoria, Queens, Mr. Enrione was the son of the late Hugo and Ermina Enrione. A 1964 graduate of Bryant High School, Mr. Enrione earned a Bachelor's degree in chemical engineering from City College in 1974. During the Vietnam War, Mr. Enrione served in the United States Navy as a Petty Officer -- Machinist's Mate. Stationed in Vietnam, he was awarded the Silver Star, as well as numerous other decorations. Bob worked for ABC News and CBS News as a videotape editor from the mid 70's through his retirement in 2010. Most notably, Bob worked for the CBS Evening News and 60 Minutes and sports. He was also a frequent commentator on political, social, and economic topics on blogs and online journals. In the mid-1990's Bob shared responsibilities with his wife, Jackie, on their local newspaper, West Side Beat. They covered neighborhood politics up through the Washington Beltway. A gourmet cook, Bob is immortalized in his Chef Hugo column providing unique, easy-to-cook recipes for Manhattanites in their traditional closet-size kitchens. The couple was married October 26, 1996. Mayor Giulilani performed the nuptials. Mr. Enrione was an amateur naval historian of enormous skill and considerable reputation. A contributor to Sea Classics and Naval History magazines, Bob's encyclopedic knowledge of naval warfare ranged from the operational intricacies of sloops and brigs-of-war, to the strategic and tactical nuances of the great naval battles of the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic wars, and the War of 1812. At the time of his passing, Bob was working on a monumental historical novel concerning life at sea during the Nelsonian period. He was also a long-time member of the U.S. Naval Institute, and an informal researcher for the renowned novelist, Dewey Lambdin. Bob was also a very talented visual artist, and his sketches of schooners, sloops, brigs, and ship-of-the-line from the great age of sail enlivened several publications and serve as special keepsakes for his family and friends. He leaves his loving wife of 15 years, Jacqueline Wolf-Enrione, as well as numerous close cousins and friends. Bob had many good friends from all walks of life from medical lab technicians to media moguls and five star generals. Those of us whose lives he touched are richer for having known him. Enrione's HMS Indefatigable 251947 shines on. In lieu of flowers, the family has requested that a donation be made in Bob's name to the Naval Institute, 291 Wood Rd, Annapolis, MD 21402, attn: Carol Parkinson. A memorial service will be announced.

HEADLINE: Advice for Perry in National Race: Watch Your Right

BYLINE: By ROSS RAMSEY. 
rramsey@texastribune.org

 BODY:
Ross Ramsey, the managing editor of The Texas Tribune, writes a column for The Tribune.
If your job was to protect Gov. Rick Perry from political attack, you'd probably protect his front, his back and his left flank -- the directions from which you'd expect his foes to attack.
You could ignore his right, right? 
Mr. Perry is supposed to check all the boxes there, collecting superlatives from social conservatives, Tea Partiers, fiscal conservatives, evangelical Christians, home-schoolers, economic-development types -- you name it.
But the first part of the presidential race isn't a general election, and it is fundamental politics to attack your opponents' strengths and weaknesses.
Mr. Perry's strength has been his conservative bona fides. Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison found that out last year, when she tried to gather the remaining moderates in the Texas Republican Party and run Mr. Perry out of the Governor's Mansion. Debra Medina, a longtime Ron Paul supporter with some claim to Tea Party support, joined in. Neither landed a serious punch, and Mr. Perry won without a runoff, then easily beat Bill White in the general election.
Front, back, left -- but not right.
Now Mr. Perry is in a national race, and guess what? Suddenly his right flank is exposed.
Late last month, he wandered into a box canyon on federalism and same-sex marriage, drawing fire from some White House wannabes. First, Mr. Perry said New Yorkers had every right to approve same-sex marriage, asserting their state's opinion on an issue that the federal government has left to the states.
''Our friends in New York six weeks ago passed a statute that said marriage can be between two people of the same sex,'' Mr. Perry said. ''And you know what? That's New York, and that's their business, and that's fine with me. That is their call. If you believe in the 10th Amendment, stay out of their business.''
His supporters gulped.
Later, Mr. Perry said he thought the federal Constitution ought to outlaw same-sex marriage. His states' rights supporters gulped.
If this was an episode of ''The Three Stooges,'' he'd have a paint can over his head and another on his right foot.
It's probably more a teachable moment than a sticky predicament -- a crash course in the difference between Texas politics, at which he's quite accomplished, and national politics, where he's playing big for the first time.
That adventure prompted a conversation about Mr. Perry's conservative credentials. It's a weird conversation from a Texas perspective, where Mr. Perry has had exactly two credible primary opponents in two decades, and it'll be interesting to see him working a new problem.
His endorsement of Rudolph W. Giuliani in the 2008 presidential race is bound to complicate things.
During that campaign, Mike Huckabee came to Texas to ask his fellow governor for a cup of sugar -- would the Southern evangelical Republican please support his Southern evangelical Republican brother from Arkansas?
Nope.
Mr. Perry went instead with Mr. Giuliani, who has previously taken what are, for today's Republicans, dangerously liberal positions on same-sex marriage, abortion and gun control.
Bloggers and other chatterers are already writing and talking about a Perry-Giuliani ticket, one of those balanced-ballot concoctions that asks the political diners if they'd like some octopus on the plate to offset the sweetness of the strawberries. Sometimes a strange pairing works -- try praline bacon at Elizabeth's next time you're in New Orleans -- while sometimes it merely alarms the diners.
Everybody in the presidential race is trying to pick off voters, and every contestant has some appeal. Michele Bachmann is after the Tea Party folk and social conservatives. Ron Paul wrote the handbook for small-government conservatives. Rick Santorum is after the social conservatives. Each can be expected to shoot at Mr. Perry or anyone who comes poaching for votes. Their ammunition will be anything that attaches to the opposition that is offensive to those voters.
It's a two-step. First, attach Mr. Perry to Mr. Giuliani. Second, use Mr. Giuliani's positions to raise doubts about Mr. Perry's.
They can couple it with Mr. Perry's own goofs, starting with his states' rights flip-flop.
But it could work the other way, too. Rick-Rudy bumper stickers, anyone?

HEADLINE: Amid Criticism on Downgrade of U.S., S.&P. Fires Back

BYLINE: By NELSON D. SCHWARTZ and ERIC DASH; Jackie Calmes, Binyamin Appelbaum, Louise Story, Julie Creswell, Liz Alderman, Jack Ewing, James Risen and David Barboza contributed reporting.

 BODY:
The day after Standard & Poor's took the unprecedented step of stripping the United States government of its top credit rating, the ratings agency offered a full-throated defense of its decision, calling the bitter stand-off between President Obama and Congress over raising the debt ceiling a ''debacle.'' It warned that further downgrades may lie ahead.
In an unusual Saturday conference call with reporters, senior S.& P. officials insisted the ratings firm hadn't overstepped its bounds by focusing on the political paralysis in Washington as much as fiscal policy in determining the new rating. ''The debacle over the debt ceiling continued until almost the midnight hour,'' said John B. Chambers, chairman of S.& P.'s sovereign ratings committee.
Another S.& P. official, David Beers, added that ''fiscal policy, like other government policy, is fundamentally a political process.'' 
Initial reactions from Congressional leaders suggested that S.& P.'s action was unlikely to force consensus on the fundamental divide over spending and taxes. Politicians on both sides used the decision to bolster their own long-standing positions.
Officials at the White House and Treasury criticized S.& P.'s move as based on faulty budget accounting that did not factor in the just-enacted deal for increasing the debt limit.
Gene Sperling, the director of the White House national economic council, called the difference, totaling over $2 trillion, ''breathtaking'' and said that ''the amateurism it displayed'' suggested ''an institution starting with a conclusion and shaping any arguments to fit it.''
Even as the ratings agency insisted on Saturday that its move shouldn't have come as a shock, it reverberated around the world. Officials from China to Europe scrambled to assess the downgrade's impact on the already troubled global economy, and political leaders in the United States sought to frame the issue in their favor.
Republican presidential candidates on Saturday seized on the downgrade as a new line of criticism against President Obama, suggesting that ultimate responsibility rests in the Oval Office.
''It happened on your watch, Mr. President,'' Representative Michele Bachmann said, drawing applause at an afternoon rally in Iowa. ''You were AWOL. You were missing in action.''
In a statement, the White House made no mention of the downgrade. ''We must do better to make clear our nation's will, capacity and commitment to work together to tackle our major fiscal and economic challenges,'' the White House press secretary, Jay Carney, said.
The ratings agency's action puts additional pressure on a still-to-be-named Congressional committee to find additional spending cuts, tax increases or both to bring down the inexorably rising national debt.
The debt-limit law agreement set spending caps in the fiscal year that begins Oct. 1 and calls for the bipartisan Congressional ''supercommittee'' to propose more deficit reduction -- for up to $2.5 trillion in combined savings over a decade.
Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid said the downgrade affirmed the need for the Democrats' approach, balancing spending cuts with higher revenue from the wealthy and corporations.
The decision, he said, ''shows why leaders should appoint members who will approach the committee's work with an open mind -- instead of hardliners who have already ruled out the balanced approach that the markets and rating agencies like S.& P. are demanding.''
House Speaker John A. Boehner of Ohio, who runs the House with his anti-tax Republican majority, said that, ''decades of reckless spending cannot be reversed immediately, especially when the Democrats who run Washington remain unwilling to make the tough choices required to put America on solid ground.''
While American politicians sparred, China, the largest foreign holder of United States debt, said on Saturday that Washington needed to ''cure its addiction to debts'' and ''live within its means,'' just hours after the S.& P. downgrade.
Europeans had girded for a possible downgrade, but the news was received with a degree of alarm in the corridors of power across the Continent.
Finance Minister Francois Baroin of France questioned the move Saturday, noting that neither Moody's nor Fitch, the two other major ratings agencies, had reached a similar conclusion.
The downgrade could lead investors to demand higher interest rates from the federal government and other borrowers, raising costs for local governments, businesses and home buyers.
The wrangling over S.& P.'s downgrade to AA+ from AAA stretched on for days. But interviews with both officials from the administration and S.& P. reveal sharply differing perceptions on whether a downgrade was imminent. The rating agency argued that their intentions had been plain for months if the government didn't take strong action to curb the debt; administration officials claimed they were blindsided.
The drama, which would culminate late Friday and into the weekend, actually began to gather speed Wednesday, when S.& P. executives came to the Treasury Department to meet with a group of administration officials led by Mary J. Miller, the assistant secretary for financial markets.
At the meeting, the S.& P. executives walked the Treasury Department team through its analysis. Government debt was growing rapidly, they said, and the just-completed deal wasn't going to do enough to slow it down, endangering the AAA rating.
As early as April, S.& P. had changed its credit outlook on the United States to negative. By July, S.& P. warned that if the government did not agree to a deficit reduction package of about $4 trillion, there was a one-in-two chance a downgrade.
Still Treasury officials claim they were taken by surprise on Wednesday. Just the day before, Ms. Miller and her team met at the Hay-Adams Hotel with a group of senior Wall Street executives who advise the Treasury on its borrowing. None of the members believed that the government's credit rating would be lowered in the near-term.
On Thursday, the ratings agency informed the Treasury that its seven-person panel would meet Friday morning to assess the creditworthiness of the United States government.
Even then, one administration official said, ''We didn't think they would actually do it.''
At 8 a.m. Friday, S.& P. convened a global conference call of its sovereign rating committee including Mr. Beers, Mr. Chambers and others. By 10 a.m., they'd reached a majority decision -- the United States no longer was entitled to its top rating. Mr. Beers would not say whether the verdict was unanimous.
Rumors of a downgrade were already swirling in the markets -- a prime reason the Dow dove more than 200 points at lunchtime, and at 1:15 p.m., the three men called the Treasury to inform them of the decision. ''They were not pleased with the news,'' Mr. Beers said.
Half an hour later, Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner called William M. Daley, the White House chief of staff, as well as Mr. Sperling, according to administration officials. They delivered the news to President Obama in the Oval Office, before he took off to Camp David for the weekend.
Inside Treasury, meanwhile, John Bellows, an acting assistant secretary, flagged a concern over S.& P.'s methodology. In its analysis, S.& P. had projected the nation's debt as a share of gross domestic product to reach 93 percent by 2021. That was around 8 percentage points higher than the figure administration officials believed the rating agency should have used -- what they now call a $2.1 trillion error.
In a Treasury blog entry, Mr. Bellows wrote that the difference raised ''fundamental questions about the credibility and integrity of S.& P.'s ratings action.''
Around 5:30 p.m., S.& P. officials called the group of Treasury officials. ''You were right,'' Mr. Chambers told them, but said he was prepared to proceed because the revisions didn't meaningfully affect S.& P.'s conclusion.
In one final effort to prevent what was once unthinkable from becoming inevitable, the Treasury officials again pressed S.& P. to reconsider. At 8 p.m., the ratings agency sent them the final press release on the downgrade. By 8:20 p.m., the news was out.
''For those who follow the fiscal situation of the United States, this shouldn't be news to anyone,'' Mr. Chambers said.

HEADLINE: 3 of Mayor's Men Join Forces. Their Goal: Harness Technology to Help the City.

BYLINE: By JAMES WARREN. 
jwarren@chicagonewscoop.org

 BODY:
James Warren writes a column for the Chicago News Cooperative.
The cramped office seems out of the movie ''A Beautiful Mind,'' where John Nash, the Nobel Prize-winning mathematician with schizophrenia and played by Russell Crowe, fills a dorm room's windows with confounding formulas and diagrams written in wax pencil -- and just stares right through them.
But this is City Hall and the diagram-filled windows belong to Brett Goldstein, Mayor Rahm Emanuel's chief digital officer. After a single encounter, I'd only partly question his sanity, since he left a nice San Francisco job with OpenTable, an online restaurant reservation service, to become a police officer on the West Side. 
But Mr. Goldstein, a Boston native who has degrees in criminal justice and computer science, wound up as a head of the Chicago Police Department's Predictive Analytics Group. And now the new mayor has teamed him with John Tolva, an I.B.M. refugee and the city's chief technology officer, and Kevin Hauswirth, its director of social media, to harness technology to make a typically calcified big-city government more transparent, more efficient and a catalyst for economic development.
In a world of Groupon, Foursquare, Facebook, Livestream, Tumblr, Twitter and Shazam, a few municipalities with similar goals, including London, New York and Washington, are exploiting relatively new strategies like social media. But no mayor appears to have created all three such positions, or to be quite so focused, as Mr. Emanuel, the vacationing heat-seeking missile with a bloodlessly pragmatic streak and prodigious Rolodex.
The early results include nearly 200 online ''data sets,'' like breakdowns of crime, calls to 311, vendors banned from city business, restaurants' rodent-baiting requests, processing time for building permits and removal of fallen trees after bad weather, response rates to graffiti-removal calls and installation of 96-gallon plastic garbage cans at single-family residences.
My personal favorite is wasmycartowed.com. Is your Honda Civic not where you left it last night? This Web site will tell you if it's in a city pound, quelling fears of its winding up in a South Side chop shop. Mr. Tolva offers a challenging historical corollary: As a pioneer in meat packing, Chicago prodded innovation in related areas like transportation and cold storage. Why not use ''data, knowledge and ideas'' as transformative agents. The two coasts need not be the only pacesetters in this regard.
A fourth-generation Chicagoan, Mr. Tolva headed an I.B.M. cultural-innovation squad that did fascinating, often pro bono work for clients worldwide. It included building virtual 3-D digital replicas of Beijing's Forbidden City during the Ming and Qing dynasties, the Hermitage Museum in St. Petersburg, Russia and the pyramids in Egypt.
His team created diverse maps and graphics for cities, assessing everything from crime in Jakarta and New Delhi, with related indices including the possible relevance of weather, to whether serving as host for the Olympic Games spurred employment. (The answer: not really.)
Mr. Goldstein and Mr. Tolva aren't merely cranking out consumer-friendly statistics; they're seeking patterns and solutions.
Can 911 calls about drug dealing or gang activity predict violence? Can oddities in strings of revenue numbers suggest malfeasance? Might streetlight failures prompt graffiti? Is there a way to tell people huddled inside a wintry bus shelter that the next two buses are packed but that an el arriving in six minutes, three blocks away, is not?
The potential is clear to them and to Mr. Hauswirth, a promotions-advertising specialist who taught social media at Roosevelt University. A city and its employees can become more efficient, more geared toward prevention and prod civic participation, whether through a Twitter message about a body found in the lake, an e-mail about a sinkhole as big as a Humvee or a neighborhood forum on Facebook about how the mayor is doing.
And one shouldn't need a computer or BlackBerry. Perhaps the city can devise a way to use a parking meter to tell you that, yes, your car was towed. Or perhaps digital signage at an el stop can be packed with information about buses, the weather, you name it.
Mr. Goldstein and Mr. Tolva are about high-tech architecture, behavior trends and aggressively courting technology entrepreneurs to look on Chicago as a fertile testing ground; Mr. Hauswirth is about conversations to improve services, participation and engagement with City Hall.
As Mr. Tolva noted, we once married pigs and cold storage in a profound, profitable way. If we play our cards right, we might blend deep data analytics and personal responsiveness to yield alluringly fat revenues.

HEADLINE: Obama Team Turns Its Focus to Tough Re-election Fight

BYLINE: By JACKIE CALMES and HELENE COOPER

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- After a month tied down in Washington by the bruising budget fight, President Obama breaks out to four battleground states this week and next, including a campaign-style bus tour in the Upper Midwest, stumping with a new urgency as global economic fears darken his re-election prospects.
Fifteen months from Election Day, Mr. Obama is gearing up his re-election effort with unemployment stuck above 9 percent, economic growth faltering, financial markets gyrating and faith in Washington depressed by the partisan debt limit fight. Now the creditworthiness of government bonds has been downgraded for the first time ever by one of the ratings agencies -- a development with symbolic meaning as well as potential practical impact.
Mr. Obama's approval ratings are below 50 percent in electoral battlegrounds like Iowa, Michigan, Ohio and Pennsylvania, according to recent polls there. His party's political infrastructure has been weakened in crucial states where Republicans won statehouses last year, though the White House sees potential benefit in a reaction to the unpopular policies of new Republican governors in states like Florida, Ohio and Wisconsin. 
Despite an intensive effort by the White House since last November to recapture the political center, Mr. Obama continues to struggle to win back the support of moderate and independent voters, polls show. Having won with their help in 2008 in states where Democrats for years had not seriously competed -- Indiana, North Carolina, Virginia and some mountain states -- Mr. Obama will now have to struggle not just to duplicate that feat but also to prevail in traditional swing states like Pennsylvania.
A recent Quinnipiac poll there had Mr. Obama two percentage points behind a Republican rival, Mitt Romney, a former Massachusetts governor -- essentially a tie, since the difference is within the margin of sampling error.
''You'd have to be anesthetized to be complacent, really, and not only because of economic circumstances,'' said Geoff Garin, a Democratic pollster who lately has held focus groups of swing voters for an independent group working for Mr. Obama's re-election. ''There are clearly concerning signs in the polling data.''
''But,'' Mr. Garin added, ''there's both a campaign yet to be run for Obama and a real debate to be had about what the way forward ought to look like.''
The next two weeks will signal an informal start to the Obama campaign's effort to address all those challenges, as he travels to Iowa, Michigan, Minnesota and Virginia. There he will begin doing what incumbent presidents of both parties do when facing a tough re-election race: trying to make the contest less a referendum on their record than a choice between two competing options. He will also work to frame the Republican option as unpalatable to most voters, even at a time of persistently high joblessness.
Mr. Obama's advisers point to polls showing that voters prefer the president's approach to the economy over that of Republicans, and that even now he gets far less blame than his Republican predecessor for the problems that persist today.
''Right now, Mitt Romney, Rick Perry and all of these Republicans are just a blank slate,'' said David Plouffe, Mr. Obama's senior strategist and his 2008 campaign manager. ''I can assure you this will be made a choice for the American people. And, I tell you, right now the American people in overwhelming numbers don't want to go back to the same policies that got us into this mess.''
Mr. Obama's advisers say the plan now is to get the president out of Washington more often and into communities where he can try to show people, on a more intimate level, how the changes he has made have helped their local economies. Advisers describe a campaign shaping up more as individual state campaigns than a national campaign, attentive to the issues and demographics in each place.
Over all, the message will be of Mr. Obama as ''someone who kept the economy from falling into a depression, who is fighting for the middle class every day and understands where the economy needs to be not just next month and next year, but for the long term so that we can compete with China and India for the future,'' said Dan Pfeiffer, the White House communications director.
On Tuesday, the president is heading to Springfield, Va., near Washington, ostensibly to highlight new fuel efficiency standards for trucks, buses and other heavy vehicles. But his advisers say Virginia, a demographically fluid state that Mr. Obama won in 2008 but that turned Republican in 2010, is a must-win for Mr. Obama's re-election strategy.
In both Virginia and North Carolina, the Obama campaign looks to a changing electorate for support. Both states have increasing numbers of younger, more moderate and well-educated voters, many interested in technology and research programs the administration has sought to help.
On Thursday, Mr. Obama will go to Holland, Mich., where he will talk about the auto industry's recovery and take credit for the bailout that salvaged it. His campaign hopes that this argument will help him in other states like Ohio that rely on auto manufacturing for jobs, as well as in states where some voters will see the rescue as an example of the president's making a tough decision in the face of opposition from Republicans.
Next week, Mr. Obama will return to the Midwest for a bus tour. For three days, he will traverse the highways and small towns of three Midwestern states -- Illinois, Iowa and Minnesota, all of which he won in 2008 -- looking for ways to show how his stimulus measure and other policies helped stem the recession and saved local jobs.
''He has to show independents, conservative Democrats and moderate Republicans -- all of those votes are still up for grabs -- that he's still a strong leader,'' former Gov. Edward G. Rendell of Pennsylvania said in an interview.
At the same time, Mr. Obama is expected to begin a nationwide effort to warn the country of what Republican leadership, in his view, looks like, Democratic advisers say. That means the president will single out Florida, Ohio and Wisconsin -- three states where Republican governors clashed with civil servants, for instance -- as a warning of what could happen if a Republican takes the White House. (''Get those nurses and firefighters who lost their job on television,'' one Democratic adviser said.)
In those three states and others, like Pennsylvania, where a disproportionate number of voters are older, Mr. Obama will hold his Republican rival responsible for proposals to replace Medicare with a smaller voucher system and to make Medicaid a limited block grant to the states.
But even with the advantages of incumbency -- including the ability to raise hundreds of millions of dollars for his campaign, employ the trappings of the presidency and call on a network of allies to attack Republicans and amplify his message -- he still faces a daunting environment as long as the economy remains the nation's main preoccupation.
''Obama's an incumbent below 50,'' said Mark Penn, chief strategist for President Bill Clinton's 1996 re-election campaign and for Hillary Rodham Clinton when she opposed Mr. Obama for the 2008 Democratic nomination. ''Don't confuse the Republican Congressional ratings with the presidential ratings. The Republicans in Congress won't be running against Obama.''

HEADLINE: Republicans Jockey as a Big Week Begins in Iowa

BYLINE: By JEFF ZELENY

 BODY:
TIFFIN, Iowa -- At the outset of a crucial week in the presidential campaign, the Republican candidates are increasingly turning on one another as they try to overcome their own weaknesses and capitalize on the vulnerabilities of President Obama.
A sense of urgency is rising for contenders to make favorable impressions at a debate on Thursday, the first time Jon M. Huntsman Jr. will join his rivals on stage. That will be followed by the Iowa Straw Poll on Saturday, a ritual that provides an early test of organizational strength that could accelerate or dampen the aspirations of some candidates.
The full Republican field will descend upon Iowa this week to court voters and present their arguments to party activists, some of whom say they are eager to build the drumbeat of criticism about Mr. Obama into a candid discussion of which candidates could best defeat him.
''The opportunity is right there for us,'' Tim Pawlenty, a former governor of Minnesota, told Republicans here on Friday. ''The main way we're going to goof this up, as Republicans, is to nominate the wrong candidate.'' 
As Mr. Pawlenty made his way across Iowa this weekend, he warned Republicans against supporting someone without executive experience. His audiences nodded in agreement. Yet the target of his criticism, Representative Michele Bachmann of Minnesota, drew booming applause from far larger audiences when she pledged to confront the establishment, declaring, ''Behind this dress is a titanium spine!''
And looming over the race is the question of whether Gov. Rick Perry of Texas will join the field this month, as he has signaled to donors, activists and party officials. His entry could deliver a jolt to the race, but it remains an open question how long he could maintain the same level of curiosity and intrigue he now holds.
''Everybody's waiting for some ideal candidate to get in,'' said Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa, who fielded a call from Mr. Perry last month. He added, ''I told him to come to Iowa now and start campaigning like you campaign for sheriff.''
As the candidates scramble to test their messages and gain attention, a majority of their arrows have been aimed at Mitt Romney, a former governor of Massachusetts.
Mr. Huntsman, a former governor of Utah, assailed Mr. Romney's leadership on the debt ceiling debate. Rick Santorum, a former senator from Pennsylvania, questioned his convictions on conservative social issues, and even Sarah Palin, who has yet to rule out a run, suggested that he placed his finger to the wind instead of leading by example.
Mr. Romney, who has maintained a disciplined silence, is preparing for rougher treatment in the debate Thursday than he received in his first one in June. His advisers say he is opening a new campaign phase by making more public appearances after several months of lying low. He is not overtly campaigning for the straw poll, but is waging a stealth campaign in Iowa to keep his options open until the field clarifies.
Republicans sense a fresh opening surrounding Mr. Obama, after painful budget talks, sustained high unemployment and the lowering of the nation's credit rating. (''It happened on your watch, Mr. President,'' Mrs. Bachmann said Saturday.) But that is offset for some by a lack of consensus over who would be the strongest -- or least flawed -- Republican nominee.
Here in Tiffin, a handful of candidates delivered speeches and mingled with 300 party activists at a picnic supper on Friday. As Mr. Pawlenty, Mr. Santorum and Newt Gingrich, a former House speaker, worked the room, several people stood out in the crowd. They wore burnt-orange shirts with white lettering: ''Americans for Rick Perry.''
It was yet another sign that Mr. Perry was inching closer toward entering the race and would not be starting a campaign from scratch. The group, formed by friends who say they are operating independently, is urging people to attend the straw poll and support Mr. Perry as a write-in candidate, since his name will not be printed on the ballot.
The political merits of the straw poll are limited, particularly for predicting the results of the caucuses next year. But the results -- fair or not, considering only a few thousand people will take part in Ames -- are likely to accelerate or extinguish the ambitions of some candidates.
Representative Ron Paul of Texas, who has wide appeal among voters with a libertarian strain, is aggressively pursuing a strong finish at the straw poll. He has been working to expand on the deep support of his core followers and has encouraged them to send the party a message. Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky, his son, will arrive this week to help.
The urgency in the voices of the candidates made clear how high the stakes are.
As Mr. Pawlenty concluded question-and-answer sessions with voters on Friday, he asked for their support -- not in the caucuses, but more immediately, at the straw poll. He urged Republicans to take seriously his admonition to elect someone who could go the distance, not a candidate with more limited appeal. ''Before you fuel this rocket and launch it out of here,'' Mr. Pawlenty said, ''make sure it can get all the way to the destination.''
Mr. Pawlenty has moved most of his campaign organization to Iowa from his national headquarters in Minneapolis. He has invested nearly all of his limited finances on television commercials and campaign material to identify supporters and persuade them to go to Ames, where a strong finish in the straw poll could move him beyond his summertime slump.
The debate on Thursday evening, being televised by Fox News, also offers an opportunity for Mr. Pawlenty to avoid the missteps that he acknowledged making at the last debate when he backed away from challenging Mr. Romney on health care. That debate hurt his fund-raising, his aides said, even as Mrs. Bachmann's steady performance helped propel her candidacy.
Mrs. Bachmann is also aggressively working to win the straw poll, which will provide a key test on whether she is able to turn the enthusiasm surrounding her candidacy into actual support. Her crowds are routinely larger than those of her rivals, but her campaign stops are staged as events more often seen in the general election, where a high priority is placed on appearances.
For two days in a row, she was late arriving at campaign events in the warm afternoon sun and humidity. Her blue campaign bus was idling nearby, but as the crowd waited for her to arrive, an aide was busy arranging the crowd, saying into a loudspeaker, ''We need to fill in the crowd and make it look nice and tight for our national media guys.''
She also sought to lower expectations, which have soared since she entered the race two months ago.
''We're at a distinct disadvantage from an organizational perspective, but the response that we've had from Iowans has been overwhelming,'' Mrs. Bachmann said. She also told the crowd that the White House was carefully watching her campaign, declaring, ''They fear my candidacy more than any other.''

8 P.M. (ABC) TY'S GREAT BRITISH ADVENTURE 2011 Ty Pennington of ''Extreme Makeover: Home Edition'' heads to Portishead, England, to save one of the country's few remaining outdoor community swimming pools. And he does it in just seven days.
8 P.M. (Discovery) CURIOSITY: DID GOD CREATE THE UNIVERSE? Created by John Hendricks, the founder and chairman of Discovery Communications, this new series merges scientific queries with celebrity appeal, starting with the astrophysicist Stephen Hawking, who asks whether the laws of nature can exist equally with a belief in God. At 9, David Gregory, of ''Meet the Press'' on NBC, leads a group of theologians in a discussion of Mr. Hawking's findings and theories. (In future episodes the actor Morgan Freeman investigates the possibility of a parallel universe; the actress Maggie Gyllenhaal explores why sex can be fun; and the documentarian Morgan Spurlock investigates whether living like prehistoric cave dwellers would improve the health of humans today.)

The tour guides: the hand-fishermen and self-professed hillbillies Skipper Bivins and Trent Jackson. The lures: fingers and toes, which are every bit as appealing to the snakes, beavers, muskrats and snapping turtles that take over abandoned catfish holes as they are to the fish themselves. The reward: deep-fried catfish and a gulp of relief. KATHRYN SHATTUCK

HEADLINE: Daughter Leads, Mom Follows In Fashion Sync

BYLINE: By AUSTIN CONSIDINE

 BODY:
ONCE upon a time, mothers paled at their daughters' fashion choices. Going braless? Horrors! Bare midriff? God forbid.
Today they're more apt to mimic them.
It's not just celebrity moms like Lynne Spears (glittery little tops) or Dina Lohan (hair, sunglasses and black blazer that looked nearly identical to her daughter Lindsay's in court last summer). Fashion industry observers say many ordinary mothers are following their daughters' style lead these days. 
''I believe many moms defer to their daughters often out of insecurity that they perhaps missed a beat through the years, or the belief that, if you are younger, you are hipper and must be in the know,'' said Sherrie Mathieson, a costume designer and celebrity style consultant based in Scottsdale, Ariz. Her 2009 book, ''Steal This Style: Moms and Daughters Swap Wardrobe Secrets,'' examines mother and daughter style sharing.
Joanne Arbuckle, dean of the School of Art and Design of the Fashion Institute of Technology in New York, attributed the change partly to the current younger generation's constant access to designer trends through technologies like social media. In generations past, Ms. Arbuckle said, ''I don't ever think we had the confidence level, in regard to the mother being confident that the child really knew what was the fashionable thing to wear.''
Researchers tried to quantify the trend in a study led by Ayalla A. Ruvio, a marketing professor at Temple University, in Philadelphia, soon to be published in the peer-reviewed Journal of Consumer Behavior. Based on a survey of 343 Israeli mother and daughter pairs (ages 44 and 16, on average), researchers found that, in cases where mothers and daughters viewed each other as fashion-savvy and respectively youthful or mature, mothers were significantly more inclined to imitate their daughters than the other way around.
Maria Beck, 45, a real estate broker in Manhattan, said she started borrowing everything from shorts to miniskirts from her daughter Jalina, 23, about eight years ago, when the two lived in Florida and wore the same size. The arrangement was, in part, a practical one. ''At the time, I was a single mom so it was very economical for us to share some articles of clothing,'' she said. Since moving to New York, their shared tastes have grown more refined. ''Now, we both aim for sophisticated style,'' the older Ms. Beck said. That means labels like Helmut Lang, Rag & Bone and Dolce & Gabbana.
Ms. Arbuckle said she has increasingly observed the phenomenon of mothers borrowing from daughters over the last few years in the United States, in families at all financial levels. ''In this economy, they probably have more disposable income than their parents do,'' she said about daughters. Still, the rule cannot apply to every mother and daughter, Ms. Mathieson said. In her experience, age and size were major determinants in whether mothers could (or should) borrow from their daughters.
Whatever the reason, the trend seems particular to today's mothers, historically speaking. ''The lines are all blurred today,'' Ms. Arbuckle said. ''It's not about, 'You're this age, and this is what you do.' ''

HEADLINE: Williamsburg on the Hudson

BYLINE: By PETER APPLEBOME

 BODY:
Millerton, N.Y.
FROM the venerable general store his grandparents opened in 1919, where you can get hunting knives, cigars, worms, khaki pants and copies of Vogue, Phil Terni has watched Dutchess County's passing parade for most of his 68 years.
The store has seen celebrated customers -- Babe Ruth, Ava Gardner, Artie Shaw, Ruth Bader Ginsburg -- amble in and out. And Mr. Terni has seen Millerton prosper as an agricultural crossroads with three hotels served by three railroads, and then decline toward irrelevance as the milk processing plant shut down and the farms died. Still, none of that has prepared him for what he sees outside his door every day.
''Not in my wildest dreams would I have expected this,'' he said in the back of the store, with its black-and-white photos of old locomotives, a giant Revolutionary War oil painting, bric-a-brac from a century of small-town commerce. ''This never would have entered my mind.'' 
And yet there it is, everywhere you look: the old diner, renamed the Oakhurst and now serving gourmet curried chicken rolls, organic burgers and venison chili cheese fries; Eckert Fine Art, with its paintings by Eric Forstmann and Robert Rauschenberg; the fliers for the Buddhist Path of Fulfillment retreat; the sustainable agriculture benefit; the artsy, SoHo-esque Hunter Bee antiques; the three-screen Moviehouse on Main Street with its art gallery and cafe.
Somehow, Mr. Terni has no idea how, Millerton has become hip, cited by the magazine Arthur Frommer's Budget Travel as one of the ''10 coolest small towns in America.''
''It's just my comfort zone,'' said Rebekah Blu, who has specialized in rock 'n' roll, celebrity and what she calls Goddess photography and moved to town with her husband and two infants from the East Village two months ago. ''You think of the East Village; you have local businesses, not chains, you don't need a car, there's lots of art and culture. You have a lot of that here, but you're living in the country.''
In the usual suspects of Hudson Valley exurban revival, like Beacon, Cold Spring and Hudson, in cities like Kingston and Poughkeepsie and smaller communities like Tivoli, Red Hook, Accord and High Falls, you can find something similar.
Call it the Brooklynization of the Hudson Valley, the steady hipness creep with its locavore cuisine, its Williamsburgian bars, its Gyrotonic exercise, feng shui consultants and deep clay art therapy and, most of all, its recent arrivals from New York City.
Jenifer Constantine and Trippy Thompson, bartenders in Williamsburg, found the adventurous loft life there a bit too precarious after the birth of their first child in 2007, and moved to New Paltz to open their own minimalist, Brooklynesque bar and restaurant in Rosendale, Market Market, with a locavore menu and weekly spoken-word slams.
Dave Lerner, a musician, found the Brooklyn life getting claustrophobic and moved to West Saugerties, a placed that seemed different but part of a familiar universe, where there was music and culture but you could bike, hike and breathe.
John Friedman, a lawyer who lived in Greenwich Village, fell in love with Hudson and went from making mostly telecom deals in Manhattan to making mostly agriculture deals in the Hudson Valley.
Kate Doris left her hometown of Kingston as it skidded downward after I.B.M. left in the '90s. Now she's back, plugged into the local art scene, amused at the number of her Brooklyn friends who have also moved up.
The greening of the Hudson Valley did not begin yesterday. It's as revealing for what it's not as for what it is. And given the comatose national economy, many grains of salt should be added to any rosy projections.
Still, in the best case, it adds up to more than refugees from the city, fair-trade coffeehouses in every far-flung town and unexpectedly cool places and culture -- the Phoenicia Festival of the Voice, the Last Bite in High Falls, the Wassaic Project arts organization in a refurbished mill and animal auction house.
Instead, you could argue, it's a new chapter in an old story -- Henry Hudson's voyage of discovery, the Hudson River School's attempt to capture an American Eden, updated for the Twitter era and based around sustainable, human-scale agriculture; manageable towns that are neither giant cities nor cookie-cutter suburbs; a $4.7 billion tourism industry; and the mountains, valleys and rivers of one of America's unspoiled places.
''We're in the early stages of a green economic revitalization of the Hudson Valley,'' said Ned Sullivan, president of Scenic Hudson, which half a century ago was at the heart of a battle to save Storm King Mountain, spurring on modern environmentalism.
''The land is being preserved,'' he said. ''Waterfront parks are being created. Water supplies are being protected. There's a green economy that's being born.''
IN the beginning was the river, which the Indians called Muhheakantuck -- ''river that flows two ways'' -- because for about half its 315 miles it is also a tidal estuary, where salty water meets fresh.
Life on the shore has flowed two ways, too, through culture and commerce. For almost a century, beginning around 1825, the Hudson Valley was the nation's first industrial heartland, an incessant bustle of shipbuilding, ironworks, railroad lines, shipping docks, cement, stone, iron, lumber, weaponry and even whaling industries.
The valley was also a seminal creator of American culture, from Washington Irving, who became America's first international literary celebrity, to the Hudson River School and later to artist colonies and the Woodstock Festival. The factories are almost all gone. The cultural buzz remains.
You can pick your favorite current image of industrial past and creative present. The stunning Dia: Beacon collection of massive modernism in an old factory on the Hudson? The exhilarating Walkway Over the Hudson that turned an abandoned railroad bridge into the world's longest pedestrian bridge? The industrial spaces turned into artists' studios in uptown Kingston?
But the Basilica Hudson seems as good a snapshot as any. Built in 1884 as a foundry and forge for manufacturing steel railway wheels, it finally shut down as a glue factory using rabbit hide in the '90s. Almost a decade ago, its 18,000 square feet were reimagined as a local gathering and performance space for ska concerts, avant-garde movies, art exhibits, filming and recording.
Like almost everything in the Hudson Valley, it's still a work in progress. But its owners, Melissa Auf der Maur, a seriously glamorous Montreal native who has played bass for bands like Smashing Pumpkins and Hole, and Tony Stone, a filmmaker, come from central casting as exemplars of the new, hip Hudson Valley.
The Basilica is the kind of space and scene that the artist and musician Patti Smith (no stranger to Hudson) had in mind a few months ago when she advised young artists that ''New York has closed itself off to the young and the struggling'' and that they should find their futures someplace else, like Poughkeepsie.
''A bunch of my friends from Montreal came to visit and they said, 'You told us you moved to a small town, but you didn't tell us you moved to a magic David Lynch town. What is this place?' '' Ms. Auf der Maur said.
Hudson, she added, has the feel of SoHo decades ago. ''There's the sense that it's manageable, it's beautiful, it has infrastructure that can inspire you and facilitate your needs and get you to feel like you're part of a moment of discovery.''
Not long ago, Hudson was notorious for drugs, prostitution and post-industrial torpor. Now, Warren Street, with its antique stores, galleries and hip restaurants, is a vision of the Hudson Valley reborn. And it was the scene of perhaps the last great battle between the old industrial Hudson Valley and the new one, when a coalition of interest groups came together to defeat a proposed coal-fired cement plant with a 40-story smokestack capable of producing two million tons of cement a year. Opponents said it would be an environmental disaster that would cut off access to the river and go against everything Hudson was becoming. They made an overwhelming case. But in the housing projects and poor neighborhoods just off Warren Street, strangers in the new landscape, it doesn't seem so clear.
Sitting in a downtown park, Calvin Wilson Sr., 63, said it was nice to see the revival on Warren Street, but it didn't offer much for him or for young people growing up in a town whose population is almost a third black and Latino, and in which one in five residents is living below the poverty level. ''All those old factory jobs, they've all dried up,'' Mr. Wilson said. ''So, where those people going to work? Me, I wished they'd built that cement plant.''
THERE is a parlor game people sometimes play, comparing Hudson Valley towns with New York neighborhoods, said Sari Botton, a freelance writer in Rosendale.
For instance, Rhinebeck might be the Upper East Side, Woodstock the West Village, New Paltz the Upper West Side, Beacon the East Village, Rosendale and High Falls different parts of Williamsburg. Tivoli could be compared to Greenpoint, Hudson to Chelsea, Catskill to Bushwick, Kingston to a mix of Fort Greene and Carroll Gardens.
The migration north began with the weekender incursions in the '80s and '90s, gained a more urgent and permanent tone after 9/11, stumbled during the real estate bust and is now finding its way again. But, for all the images of upstate decay, the population of the Hudson Valley is growing more than twice as fast as that of the rest of the state -- 5.8 percent over the past decade, compared with 2.1 percent for New York State and New York City. (While there are no universally accepted boundaries to the Hudson Valley, this reference includes the counties north of suburban Rockland and Westchester and south of the capital region: Putnam, Orange, Dutchess, Ulster, Columbia and Greene.)
Add in disparate institutions with some shared sensibilities -- Bard, Vassar and SUNY New Paltz; the Culinary Institute of America and the sustainable agriculture Glynwood Institute; the New Age Omega Institute, Dia:Beacon, the Storm King Art Center, the green, hip and upscale Chronogram Magazine -- you can posit a synergy that is gaining critical mass.
Some of the growth is an extension of suburban New York into Putnam and Orange Counties. The rest is an exurban phenomenon facilitated at least in part by new technology, the limitations of space and cost in the five boroughs and the natural search for something new.
For some it's generational. The Hudson Valley seems a cooler and more affordable alternative to the suburbs. David Clark moved to Beacon seeking space for his ceramic tile business, ModCraft, in a place that felt familiar and creative. At 43, he also felt he had outgrown Williamsburg. ''At some point you look around and find yourself surrounded by club kids and feel, well, maybe I've done this already,'' he said.
For others, the Hudson Valley just seemed a natural fit. Amber Rubarth, 28, an up-and-coming singer-songwriter who used to carve wood sculptures with chainsaws, figured she could make music and live a creative life just as easily in Rosendale as in Brooklyn, and more sanely. ''I go into the city once or twice a week,'' she said, ''but there's nothing I can't do living here, and it's nice to fall asleep and wake up to birds singing rather than trash trucks rolling down the street.''
Still, as with everywhere else in America, the question remains: All right, but where are the jobs? Mr. Sullivan of Scenic Hudson said one answer could be the abandoned I.B.M. complex now called Tech City in Kingston. Its 258 acres, 28 buildings and 2.5 million square feet of industrial and office space are envisioned as a state-of-the-art locale for solar, green energy and sustainable agricultural businesses, like bakeries and fish hatcheries. Across the street is the ambitious nonprofit Solar Energy Consortium, formed in 2007 to assist and incubate solar and green companies. It's an alluring vision.
Whether it becomes reality is another matter. Todd Roberts, chief executive of one of the firms there already, Solartech Renewables, is enthusiastic about the site and the industrial solar panels his company makes, but realistic about the obstacles ahead.
''We know it's going to take root somewhere, but if the market doesn't grow here, and the subsidies don't change in China, that's where it's going to be,'' he said.
IF you were an investor wagering on any Hudson Valley city, it might be Beacon, with a world-class attraction in Dia:Beacon, its walkable downtown, and an emerging art scene a 90-minute train ride from Grand Central Terminal.
But you would still be hoping for the best, as you would with almost every place in the area. Maybe the Roundhouse at Beacon Falls, a proposed 58-room hotel and spa, with a fancy restaurant and living and work space for artists, will succeed, and revitalize an area of shuttered factories and warehouses. Maybe the historic downtown theater will reopen, and the old incline railroad will be rebuilt. But maybe not.
On a summer Tuesday afternoon, it's still a ghost town.
Tim Davis, 48, in Chicago Bulls cap and colors, has lived in Beacon almost all his life, but he is moving to Atlanta. ''There's no work here,'' he said. ''Basically they've turned this place into Antiqueworld. When we had the factories, this was a money-making town. Now it's not. Everyone I know is moving to the South.''
At the Morphicism gallery, the proprietor, Jay Palefsky, offered a cheerful greeting: ''A customer! In Beacon!''
So many people have moved to Beacon from Brooklyn that people now call it NoBro, he said. He would like to buy into the hype, but he doesn't see it. The economy is dead. The Internet has killed downtown commerce. He has seen well over a dozen businesses come and go in the five years he has been in business. ''People want the access to the city without the craziness of the city,'' Mr. Palefsky said. ''But this just needs a lot of variables to make it work. One is the economy, and I don't think that's going to happen. Sorry to be so negative. I just don't grasp the optimism.''
But optimism is one thing you find in the Hudson Valley, to an extent not seen elsewhere. It is true that, even here, it takes more than art, farm stands and caffeine to make an economy work -- especially for those who don't make a living with a laptop or a paintbrush. But in a culture sometimes whipsawed between a desire to be in the middle of the storm and to be a million miles away, the Hudson Valley offers the promise of both, the upstate hills and quirky towns just 90 minutes from Manhattan, said Bradley Thomason, who moved his small technology and organizational development consultancy, Miraclelabb, from Manhattan to the mighty metropolis of Accord last year.
''This isn't like the tech revolution,'' he said. ''I'd be worried if there were some big kaboom Hudson Valley moment. But I think what you're seeing is a slow progression toward something that can sustain itself.''

HEADLINE: What Happened To Obama?

BYLINE: By DREW WESTEN

 BODY:
Drew Westen is a professor of psychology at Emory University and the author of ''The Political Brain: The Role of Emotion in Deciding the Fate of the Nation.''
Atlanta
IT was a blustery day in Washington on Jan. 20, 2009, as it often seems to be on the day of a presidential inauguration. As I stood with my 8-year-old daughter, watching the president deliver his inaugural address, I had a feeling of unease. It wasn't just that the man who could be so eloquent had seemingly chosen not to be on this auspicious occasion, although that turned out to be a troubling harbinger of things to come. It was that there was a story the American people were waiting to hear -- and needed to hear -- but he didn't tell it. And in the ensuing months he continued not to tell it, no matter how outrageous the slings and arrows his opponents threw at him. 
The stories our leaders tell us matter, probably almost as much as the stories our parents tell us as children, because they orient us to what is, what could be, and what should be; to the worldviews they hold and to the values they hold sacred. Our brains evolved to ''expect'' stories with a particular structure, with protagonists and villains, a hill to be climbed or a battle to be fought. Our species existed for more than 100,000 years before the earliest signs of literacy, and another 5,000 years would pass before the majority of humans would know how to read and write.
Stories were the primary way our ancestors transmitted knowledge and values. Today we seek movies, novels and ''news stories'' that put the events of the day in a form that our brains evolved to find compelling and memorable. Children crave bedtime stories; the holy books of the three great monotheistic religions are written in parables; and as research in cognitive science has shown, lawyers whose closing arguments tell a story win jury trials against their legal adversaries who just lay out ''the facts of the case.''
When Barack Obama rose to the lectern on Inauguration Day, the nation was in tatters. Americans were scared and angry. The economy was spinning in reverse. Three-quarters of a million people lost their jobs that month. Many had lost their homes, and with them the only nest eggs they had. Even the usually impervious upper middle class had seen a decade of stagnant or declining investment, with the stock market dropping in value with no end in sight. Hope was as scarce as credit.
In that context, Americans needed their president to tell them a story that made sense of what they had just been through, what caused it, and how it was going to end. They needed to hear that he understood what they were feeling, that he would track down those responsible for their pain and suffering, and that he would restore order and safety. What they were waiting for, in broad strokes, was a story something like this:
''I know you're scared and angry. Many of you have lost your jobs, your homes, your hope. This was a disaster, but it was not a natural disaster. It was made by Wall Street gamblers who speculated with your lives and futures. It was made by conservative extremists who told us that if we just eliminated regulations and rewarded greed and recklessness, it would all work out. But it didn't work out. And it didn't work out 80 years ago, when the same people sold our grandparents the same bill of goods, with the same results. But we learned something from our grandparents about how to fix it, and we will draw on their wisdom. We will restore business confidence the old-fashioned way: by putting money back in the pockets of working Americans by putting them back to work, and by restoring integrity to our financial markets and demanding it of those who want to run them. I can't promise that we won't make mistakes along the way. But I can promise you that they will be honest mistakes, and that your government has your back again.'' A story isn't a policy. But that simple narrative -- and the policies that would naturally have flowed from it -- would have inoculated against much of what was to come in the intervening two and a half years of failed government, idled factories and idled hands. That story would have made clear that the president understood that the American people had given Democrats the presidency and majorities in both houses of Congress to fix the mess the Republicans and Wall Street had made of the country, and that this would not be a power-sharing arrangement. It would have made clear that the problem wasn't tax-and-spend liberalism or the deficit -- a deficit that didn't exist until George W. Bush gave nearly $2 trillion in tax breaks largely to the wealthiest Americans and squandered $1 trillion in two wars.
And perhaps most important, it would have offered a clear, compelling alternative to the dominant narrative of the right, that our problem is not due to spending on things like the pensions of firefighters, but to the fact that those who can afford to buy influence are rewriting the rules so they can cut themselves progressively larger slices of the American pie while paying less of their fair share for it.
But there was no story -- and there has been none since.
In similar circumstances, Franklin D. Roosevelt offered Americans a promise to use the power of his office to make their lives better and to keep trying until he got it right. Beginning in his first inaugural address, and in the fireside chats that followed, he explained how the crash had happened, and he minced no words about those who had caused it. He promised to do something no president had done before: to use the resources of the United States to put Americans directly to work, building the infrastructure we still rely on today. He swore to keep the people who had caused the crisis out of the halls of power, and he made good on that promise. In a 1936 speech at Madison Square Garden, he thundered, ''Never before in all our history have these forces been so united against one candidate as they stand today. They are unanimous in their hate for me -- and I welcome their hatred.''
When Barack Obama stepped into the Oval Office, he stepped into a cycle of American history, best exemplified by F.D.R. and his distant cousin, Teddy. After a great technological revolution or a major economic transition, as when America changed from a nation of farmers to an urban industrial one, there is often a period of great concentration of wealth, and with it, a concentration of power in the wealthy. That's what we saw in 1928, and that's what we see today. At some point that power is exercised so injudiciously, and the lives of so many become so unbearable, that a period of reform ensues -- and a charismatic reformer emerges to lead that renewal. In that sense, Teddy Roosevelt started the cycle of reform his cousin picked up 30 years later, as he began efforts to bust the trusts and regulate the railroads, exercise federal power over the banks and the nation's food supply, and protect America's land and wildlife, creating the modern environmental movement.
Those were the shoes -- that was the historic role -- that Americans elected Barack Obama to fill. The president is fond of referring to ''the arc of history,'' paraphrasing the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s famous statement that ''the arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends toward justice.'' But with his deep-seated aversion to conflict and his profound failure to understand bully dynamics -- in which conciliation is always the wrong course of action, because bullies perceive it as weakness and just punch harder the next time -- he has broken that arc and has likely bent it backward for at least a generation.
When Dr. King spoke of the great arc bending toward justice, he did not mean that we should wait for it to bend. He exhorted others to put their full weight behind it, and he gave his life speaking with a voice that cut through the blistering force of water cannons and the gnashing teeth of police dogs. He preached the gospel of nonviolence, but he knew that whether a bully hid behind a club or a poll tax, the only effective response was to face the bully down, and to make the bully show his true and repugnant face in public.
IN contrast, when faced with the greatest economic crisis, the greatest levels of economic inequality, and the greatest levels of corporate influence on politics since the Depression, Barack Obama stared into the eyes of history and chose to avert his gaze. Instead of indicting the people whose recklessness wrecked the economy, he put them in charge of it. He never explained that decision to the public -- a failure in storytelling as extraordinary as the failure in judgment behind it. Had the president chosen to bend the arc of history, he would have told the public the story of the destruction wrought by the dismantling of the New Deal regulations that had protected them for more than half a century. He would have offered them a counternarrative of how to fix the problem other than the politics of appeasement, one that emphasized creating economic demand and consumer confidence by putting consumers back to work. He would have had to stare down those who had wrecked the economy, and he would have had to tolerate their hatred if not welcome it. But the arc of his temperament just didn't bend that far.
The truly decisive move that broke the arc of history was his handling of the stimulus. The public was desperate for a leader who would speak with confidence, and they were ready to follow wherever the president led. Yet instead of indicting the economic policies and principles that had just eliminated eight million jobs, in the most damaging of the tic-like gestures of compromise that have become the hallmark of his presidency -- and against the advice of multiple Nobel-Prize-winning economists -- he backed away from his advisers who proposed a big stimulus, and then diluted it with tax cuts that had already been shown to be inert. The result, as predicted in advance, was a half-stimulus that half-stimulated the economy. That, in turn, led the White House to feel rightly unappreciated for having saved the country from another Great Depression but in the unenviable position of having to argue a counterfactual -- that something terrible might have happened had it not half-acted.
To the average American, who was still staring into the abyss, the half-stimulus did nothing but prove that Ronald Reagan was right, that government is the problem. In fact, the average American had no idea what Democrats were trying to accomplish by deficit spending because no one bothered to explain it to them with the repetition and evocative imagery that our brains require to make an idea, particularly a paradoxical one, ''stick.'' Nor did anyone explain what health care reform was supposed to accomplish (other than the unbelievable and even more uninspiring claim that it would ''bend the cost curve''), or why ''credit card reform'' had led to an increase in the interest rates they were already struggling to pay. Nor did anyone explain why saving the banks was such a priority, when saving the homes the banks were foreclosing didn't seem to be. All Americans knew, and all they know today, is that they're still unemployed, they're still worried about how they're going to pay their bills at the end of the month and their kids still can't get a job. And now the Republicans are chipping away at unemployment insurance, and the president is making his usual impotent verbal exhortations after bargaining it away.
What makes the ''deficit debate'' we just experienced seem so surreal is how divorced the conversation in Washington has been from conversations around the kitchen table everywhere else in America. Although I am a scientist by training, over the last several years, as a messaging consultant to nonprofit groups and Democratic leaders, I have studied the way voters think and feel, talking to them in plain language. At this point, I have interacted in person or virtually with more than 50,000 Americans on a range of issues, from taxes and deficits to abortion and immigration.
The average voter is far more worried about jobs than about the deficit, which few were talking about while Bush and the Republican Congress were running it up. The conventional wisdom is that Americans hate government, and if you ask the question in the abstract, people will certainly give you an earful about what government does wrong. But if you give them the choice between cutting the deficit and putting Americans back to work, it isn't even close. But it's not just jobs. Americans don't share the priorities of either party on taxes, budgets or any of the things Congress and the president have just agreed to slash -- or failed to slash, like subsidies to oil companies. When it comes to tax cuts for the wealthy, Americans are united across the political spectrum, supporting a message that says, ''In times like these, millionaires ought to be giving to charity, not getting it.''
When pitted against a tough budget-cutting message straight from the mouth of its strongest advocates, swing voters vastly preferred a message that began, ''The best way to reduce the deficit is to put Americans back to work.'' This statement is far more consistent with what many economists are saying publicly -- and what investors apparently believe, as evident in the nosedive the stock market took after the president and Congress ''saved'' the economy.
So where does that leave us?
Like most Americans, at this point, I have no idea what Barack Obama -- and by extension the party he leads -- believes on virtually any issue. The president tells us he prefers a ''balanced'' approach to deficit reduction, one that weds ''revenue enhancements'' (a weak way of describing popular taxes on the rich and big corporations that are evading them) with ''entitlement cuts'' (an equally poor choice of words that implies that people who've worked their whole lives are looking for handouts). But the law he just signed includes only the cuts. This pattern of presenting inconsistent positions with no apparent recognition of their incoherence is another hallmark of this president's storytelling. He announces in a speech on energy and climate change that we need to expand offshore oil drilling and coal production -- two methods of obtaining fuels that contribute to the extreme weather Americans are now seeing. He supports a health care law that will use Medicaid to insure about 15 million more Americans and then endorses a budget plan that, through cuts to state budgets, will most likely decimate Medicaid and other essential programs for children, senior citizens and people who are vulnerable by virtue of disabilities or an economy that is getting weaker by the day. He gives a major speech on immigration reform after deporting more than 700,000 immigrants in two years, a pace faster than nearly any other period in American history.
THE real conundrum is why the president seems so compelled to take both sides of every issue, encouraging voters to project whatever they want on him, and hoping they won't realize which hand is holding the rabbit. That a large section of the country views him as a socialist while many in his own party are concluding that he does not share their values speaks volumes -- but not the volumes his advisers are selling: that if you make both the right and left mad, you must be doing something right.
As a practicing psychologist with more than 25 years of experience, I will resist the temptation to diagnose at a distance, but as a scientist and strategic consultant I will venture some hypotheses.
The most charitable explanation is that he and his advisers have succumbed to a view of electoral success to which many Democrats succumb -- that ''centrist'' voters like ''centrist'' politicians. Unfortunately, reality is more complicated. Centrist voters prefer honest politicians who help them solve their problems. A second possibility is that he is simply not up to the task by virtue of his lack of experience and a character defect that might not have been so debilitating at some other time in history. Those of us who were bewitched by his eloquence on the campaign trail chose to ignore some disquieting aspects of his biography: that he had accomplished very little before he ran for president, having never run a business or a state; that he had a singularly unremarkable career as a law professor, publishing nothing in 12 years at the University of Chicago other than an autobiography; and that, before joining the United States Senate, he had voted ''present'' (instead of ''yea'' or ''nay'') 130 times, sometimes dodging difficult issues.
A somewhat less charitable explanation is that we are a nation that is being held hostage not just by an extremist Republican Party but also by a president who either does not know what he believes or is willing to take whatever position he thinks will lead to his re-election. Perhaps those of us who were so enthralled with the magnificent story he told in ''Dreams From My Father'' appended a chapter at the end that wasn't there -- the chapter in which he resolves his identity and comes to know who he is and what he believes in.
Or perhaps, like so many politicians who come to Washington, he has already been consciously or unconsciously corrupted by a system that tests the souls even of people of tremendous integrity, by forcing them to dial for dollars -- in the case of the modern presidency, for hundreds of millions of dollars. When he wants to be, the president is a brilliant and moving speaker, but his stories virtually always lack one element: the villain who caused the problem, who is always left out, described in impersonal terms, or described in passive voice, as if the cause of others' misery has no agency and hence no culpability. Whether that reflects his aversion to conflict, an aversion to conflict with potential campaign donors that today cripples both parties' ability to govern and threatens our democracy, or both, is unclear.
A final explanation is that he ran for president on two contradictory platforms: as a reformer who would clean up the system, and as a unity candidate who would transcend the lines of red and blue. He has pursued the one with which he is most comfortable given the constraints of his character, consistently choosing the message of bipartisanship over the message of confrontation.
But the arc of history does not bend toward justice through capitulation cast as compromise. It does not bend when 400 people control more of the wealth than 150 million of their fellow Americans. It does not bend when the average middle-class family has seen its income stagnate over the last 30 years while the richest 1 percent has seen its income rise astronomically. It does not bend when we cut the fixed incomes of our parents and grandparents so hedge fund managers can keep their 15 percent tax rates. It does not bend when only one side in negotiations between workers and their bosses is allowed representation. And it does not bend when, as political scientists have shown, it is not public opinion but the opinions of the wealthy that predict the votes of the Senate. The arc of history can bend only so far before it breaks.
Correction: August 14, 2011, Sunday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An opinion essay on Aug. 7 about President Obama's leadership and principles referred incorrectly to the number of deportations under his presidency. More than 700,000 immigrants were deported during Mr. Obama's first two years in office; it is not the case that a million immigrants were deported in 2010, the year Mr. Obama gave a speech on immigration reform. Also, a larger number of deportations occurred over the two terms of George W. Bush, Mr. Obama's predecessor; Mr. Obama has not overseen more deportations than any other president.

HEADLINE: TIF Aided Public and Private Projects Almost Evenly, Analysis Shows

BYLINE: By JUAN-PABLO VELEZ. 
jvelez@chicagonewscoop.org

 BODY:
For years, former Mayor Richard M. Daley heard criticism that City Hall's use of a particular economic development tool amounted to little more than a slush fund for him to subsidize corporate Chicago at the public's expense.
Mr. Daley invariably responded that he used plenty of the money generated by the tool, tax-increment financing or TIF (pronounced tiff) for schools, parks, elevated-train stations and other purely public pursuits across the city.
Now, as aides to Mayor Rahm Emanuel review the city's use of TIF amid the backdrop of severe budget shortfalls, an analysis by the Chicago News Cooperative shows that TIF spending was allocated almost evenly between public works and subsidies for private interests.
The examination of city TIF records for the last eight years of Mr. Daley's tenure reveals that his administration spent about $1.7 billion in TIF money toward public and private endeavors. While about $700 million was spent to the benefit of private interests, roughly $865 million went to public projects like school construction, street repairs and Chicago Transit Authority stations and tracks. 
Another $1 billion paid off bonds issued to finance public and private projects, for a total outlay of almost $3 billion, the city records show.
The city began using TIF in 1984, after state lawmakers authorized the financing technique to help cities spur development in blighted or declining areas. Once the city designates an area as a TIF district, the amount of property taxes that the city, county, schools and other local governments can collect from it is frozen for 23 years. Any new tax revenue generated from rising property values -- the tax increment -- is collected by the city and must be spent within the district or in a bordering one.
The intent is to use these pots of money to lure investment from private real estate investors by fixing infrastructure, acquiring properties for developers or subsidizing them directly. As the developers build or renovate offices, homes and factories, property values presumably rise, leading to incremental increases in property tax revenues.
''I think the public would be in some ways heartened to know that a lot of their money has gone into public facilities and infrastructure,'' said Rachel Weber, associate professor in the urban planning and policy program at the University of Illinois at Chicago and a member of the panel appointed by Mr. Emanuel to examine the program's effectiveness. ''This might answer some of the TIF critics that have said that TIFs have just gone to line the pockets of developers.''
But many people remain unswayed. They point out that much of the TIF money was diverted from public schools, parks, libraries and other taxing districts and was instead put into accounts that Mr. Daley controlled and kept shrouded in secrecy.
''The findings do nothing to dissuade what had been my longstanding concerns, which were transparency in the process,'' said John Fritchey, a Cook County commissioner.
Mr. Fritchey, a North Side Democrat, irked Mr. Daley last year when, as a state representative, he introduced legislation that would have funneled TIF money directly to the Chicago Public Schools.
Mr. Fritchey and other elected officials in Chicago have said that hundreds of millions of dollars are sitting in the accounts of scores of TIF districts, even after Mr. Daley tapped the TIF account last year to help balance the city's 2011 budget.
''There is no question that several good projects came to be through the use of TIF funds,'' Mr. Fritchey said. ''The bigger question is, Is the city getting its money's worth out of that investment? It's a troubling prospect to give millions of taxpayer dollars to projects that are also generating millions in developer fees.''
Mr. Daley vigorously championed the use of TIF. By the end of his tenure in May, city officials had established more than 160 TIF districts that covered about one-third of Chicago. In total, the districts capture about $500 million a year, city and Cook County documents show.
The amount is equal to about one-sixth of the city's annual core budget, although under Mr. Daley the money was not tracked or approved as part of the budgeting process, and his administration provided only a vague accounting of its TIF activities.
Mr. Emanuel has already made marked improvement in transparency by making TIF data public. He has promised to detail the flow of TIF dollars in his first city budget proposal, due in October.
The analysis by the Chicago News Cooperative relied on TIF expense records obtained from the city's Department of Finance through the Freedom of Information Act. Because officials did not classify expenditures by spending category in that data, the analysis involved categorizing thousands of payments. Ultimately, all but 2 percent of the city's TIF spending was able to be tracked.
Between 2002 and September 2010 -- when Mr. Daley announced he would not seek re-election --he used about $626 million for public projects, including rejuvenated C.T.A. stations, 11 new schools, Millennium Park and dozens of other parks throughout the city. Another $238 million went to street improvements, bridge repairs, new streetlights and other public infrastructure projects.
Developers received $505 million in subsidies, just over 30 percent of the total TIF money spent by Mr. Daley. Those payments included $5.4 million to United Airlines to move its headquarters to Willis Tower, $13.7 million for the insurance giant CNA to renovate its South Loop headquarters and $8.5 million to help renovate the Carbide and Carbon building to house the Hard Rock Hotel on Michigan Avenue.
The city also spent more than $200 million buying properties, razing vacant buildings and cleaning up toxic land, mostly for the benefit of private developments.
Another $90 million, or 5 percent of total spending, was used for program administration, consulting and legal services, and for job training for businesses in select districts.
Those figures track closely with city data presented last month at a public forum organized by Mr. Emanuel's Task Force on TIF Reform. The 10-member panel has promised to release a report and recommendations this month.
According to the documents distributed at the forum on the South Side on July 28, the city has spent about $3.7 billion in TIF money on public works and private projects in the almost 30 years since the program began. Private subsidies accounted for a slightly greater share of the disbursements than public works.
Of the $1.8 billion devoted to private investors, the leading categories were mixed-use projects (33 percent), commercial (29 percent), industrial (15 percent) and residential development (11 percent).
The $1.7 billion for public works was divided among schools (47 percent), ''streets and public buildings'' (40 percent) and parks (13 percent).
The city has also spent $131 million in TIF proceeds on programs to aid small-business owners and homeowners, the city documents show.
In recent years, however, the balance of TIF spending has tilted more toward public works than private subsidies. The biggest factor in that shift was the city's $515.2 million, seven-year initiative to build or renovate 23 schools. More than $340 million of the money earmarked for the schools program has already been spent, records show.
That left about $868 million in unspent TIF money at the end of 2010. Although the weak economy and high rates of unpaid property tax bills could slow the program's growth, city officials project that recently created TIF districts will still drive an increase in revenue, from $463 million this year to more than $508 million in 2013.
How that money is used may depend on the reform panel's suggestions. Members are ''charged with developing a comprehensive policy regarding the use of TIF funds, including standards for future investments and measurable performance criteria,'' according to the annual financial analysis released by Emanuel aides last month.
In that document, city budget officials estimate that private developers contribute $5 for each TIF dollar the city invests.
''The city understands that, on a big-picture level, there is value in looking at the program as a whole, which is why the mayor is leading a comprehensive effort to evaluate all aspects of the TIF program,'' said Tom Alexander, a spokesman for the Emanuel administration.
Representative Mike Quigley, Democrat of Illinois, praised the new mayor's efforts at transparency and said the city should conduct an audit to track the contractors, lawyers and others who benefited from the program.
''This is Chicago,'' Mr. Quigley said, ''and when you are flying blind with hundreds of millions of dollars, bad things can happen.''
Critics of TIF frequently complain that too much of the money was spent in or near downtown, in areas that scarcely need such help. The analysis confirmed that TIF spending was skewed toward wealthier areas. For example, about $430 million was spent since 2002 in the Central Loop TIF district alone. That district's TIF status expired in 2008.
But some experts say Mr. Daley's heavy spending on downtown reflected the fact that TIF districts in Chicago's dense, booming core netted vast amounts of property taxes, while those in poor areas struggled to raise revenue.
''In truly blighted areas, it's very hard for TIF to jump-start development,'' said Ms. Weber, the University of Illinois-Chicago professor and TIF panel member. ''It's a sweetener, so it plays off of there being some developer interest in an area.''

HEADLINE: Sunday Dialogue: How to Fix Government

 BODY:
A letter on Thursday lamented the state of politics today and urged changes. Readers critique those ideas and offer their own.
The Letter
To the Editor:
Democratic government requires compromise to work. But when government loses focus and succumbs entirely to compromise and tricks, we have government in name only.
A small segment of Congress seems to be the tail wagging the dog. President Obama and both Democrats and Republicans have capitulated -- the Republicans because they need the minority as part of their political base, and the Democrats because they, well, are Democrats. The president seems unwilling or unable to grab the reins.
When President Ronald Reagan had to raise taxes, he did. When faced with a union leadership that tested his resolve, he fired the union membership. When the Republicans threatened to shut down the government to get their way, President Bill Clinton let them shut it down. 
We need to get some of the tricks and gimmicks out of government. The Senate should constrain the use of the filibuster. We should also consider lengthening the terms of House members from two to four years to reduce re-election pressures in the face of important policy decisions. The Electoral College should be abandoned, leaving the president to be elected by a simple majority. And further work must be done to reform the financing of elections and the influence of lobbying by special interests.
We need to elect representatives who are smart, represent our best interests and are tough enough to stand their ground. Leadership restores confidence and keeps fear at bay. Lack of leadership promotes the opposite.
BRUCE NEUMAN Sag Harbor, N.Y., Aug. 2, 2011
The writer is a retired lawyer.
Readers React
Mr. Neuman laments that the United States government no longer works. His evidence? There is far too much ''compromise,'' and far too many obstructionist ''tricks'' and ''gimmicks'' in our system to permit focused policy action.
He says we are left with ''government in name only.'' There is another name for a political system that forces difficult compromise and is filled with obstructions to swift policy action: the American political system, as embodied in the Constitution.
After nearly three years of growth in government, thousand-page bills, countless new regulations and the birth of new entitlements, the American political system has put up its hand and said ''stop.'' In other words, the system indeed works.
STUART GOTTLIEB New York, Aug. 4, 2011
The writer teaches public policy at Columbia University.
Mr. Neuman offers a helpful diagnosis of the problems and some pragmatic suggestions. I'll offer two more.
First, elect a president who will function as a chief executive rather than as a community organizer. While I appreciate President Obama's commitment to building consensus and community, the two houses of Congress are not a Chicago neighborhood, and not all of its inhabitants need to be appeased.
Second, elect members of Congress who believe in governing. While there is room to debate the reach of government, the value of having a functioning, effective and efficient government ought not to be up for debate.
GARY L. HARKE Harrisburg, Pa., Aug. 4, 2011
In response to Mr. Neuman's statement regarding ''tricks and gimmicks,'' I would point out some characteristics of British and French government that might help fix our own broken political system.
In both countries, individual members of Parliament are not allowed to introduce finance bills; the national budget is prepared by the cabinet and prime minister, and they must approve any parliamentary amendments to finance bills. These provisions prevent the ''pork barrel'' legislation and trading of favors so prevalent in our Congress.
And an embarrassing debt-ceiling standoff? In France, the executive's budget is considered adopted if Parliament does not pass a budget within 70 days!
RICHARD M. ROMERO Smithtown, N.Y., Aug. 4, 2011
The writer is chairman of a junior high school social studies department.
I disagree with Mr. Neuman, and others, who suggest that the recent debt-ceiling debacle has proved that the country needs fewer politicians who compromise and more who ''stand their ground.''
It was newly elected House Republicans who stood their ground and pushed the United States to the brink of default, thereby damaging the country's financial standing in the world. It was Congressional Republicans who last winter refused to consider allowing the Bush tax cuts to expire. The last two years are replete with examples like these.
Standing one's ground is one thing. But recognizing political reality is another, especially when one party has publicly expressed its determination to deny this president a second term, no matter the cost to the country.
NIELS AABOE New York, Aug. 4, 2011
The changes suggested by Mr. Neuman are all good ones, but the one I like best is: ''The Electoral College should be abandoned, leaving the president to be elected by a simple majority.'' I live in Georgia, which is almost always a red state, and if I vote for the Democratic candidate, my vote is essentially meaningless. Is this democratic?
LLEWELLYN W. BELL Atlanta, Aug. 4, 2011
The most direct, albeit unlikely government fix would be to stop gerrymandering Congressional districts, making them safe for incumbents. If the districts were more evenly balanced, candidates would have to appeal to a broader base, and would, by design, be more moderate.
WILLIAM LUCYSHYN College Park, Md., Aug. 4, 2011
The writer is director of research at the Center for Public Policy and Private Enterprise, University of Maryland.
Mr. Neuman's reasons for overhauling our democratic practices argue instead for their effectiveness. A significant portion of the public, unhappy about the economy and sold on the idea that the problem is deficit spending and not the recession, elected Tea Party types. These representatives came to Congress and did what they said they would do. Mr. Neuman would have them in office for four years? Please, no.
JAMIE BALDWIN Redding, Conn., Aug. 4, 2011
The only fix is for Hillary Rodham Clinton to challenge President Obama in the Democratic primary. This time she would win overwhelmingly because many more voters now see that our current neophyte, compliant president is in way over his head. Ms. Clinton, on the other hand, is, as Matthew Norman wrote in the British newspaper The Independent, ''a street-fighter, and would never have surrendered to the Tea Party's pulverizing nastiness and juggernaut stupidity.''
HORACE BARKER Chattanooga, Tenn., Aug. 4, 2011
Mr. Neuman accuses Democrats of capitulating ''because they, well, are Democrats'' and asserts that the ''president seems unwilling or unable to grab the reins.'' It is just such uncritical carping that threatens the nation.
The Senate's minority leader, Mitch McConnell, has said, ''The single most important thing we want to achieve is for President Obama to be a one-term president.'' His most effective strategy for achieving this is defeat of any measure that might improve our economy. Because Republicans not only control the House of Representatives but also have enough votes to sustain filibusters in the Senate, no amount of ''rein-grabbing'' can thwart that strategy.
What can help them, however, is criticism of Democrats for compromising, for doing the only thing that might mitigate Republican-inspired disasters. Such shortsighted criticism can help persuade Democratic voters to refrain from voting in 2012 just as they did with such disastrous results in 2010.
STAN KURZBAN Chappaqua, N.Y., Aug. 4, 2011
I think Mr. Neuman's last suggestion should come first. Special interests control the political process. Tinkering with a few rules regarding length of office terms and the filibuster will just mean that the monied interests will find other ways to maintain control. Frankly, I don't see any way to restore even a semblance of democracy until the Citizens United decision is overturned.
MARTHA SHELLEY Portland, Ore., Aug. 4, 2011
The Writer Responds
I am not sure what Mr. Gottlieb's evidence is that the American political system ''put up its hand and said 'stop.' '' The federal government has grown over many, many years in response to an ever more complicated society, a testament to the Constitution. My point is that good government should result in good decision-making that reflects the desires and interests of a majority. A vocal minority should certainly have its say but not control the debate.
Although I am a fan of President Obama, I agree with Mr. Harke that the president might have stood his ground better in recent political battles, which I believe was his duty and which would have reaped better results. The president needs to have an instinct for when to be a mediator and when to be a leader. As Abraham Lincoln once said, ''Be sure you put your feet in the right place, then stand firm.''
Perhaps, as Mr. Romero suggests, there is something to be learned from the British and French systems; however, we must operate within our own system. Within those parameters, the system needs further transparency.
In response to Mr. Aaboe, the debate is often between reasonable compromise and standing true to one's principles. However, what we are really seeking is a good result, and when one side becomes intransigent, those who would otherwise believe in reasonable compromise must adjust to the fight.
I agree wholeheartedly with Ms. Bell that we should all have an equal vote when it comes to the presidency. Indeed, the Electoral College has outlived its usefulness.
Mr. Lucyshyn is quite correct regarding the issue of gerrymandering, another example of tricks of the political trade. We do best when our politics reflects our diversity in a fair manner.
I have no objection to the election of Tea Party types, Mr. Baldwin, and if they represent a majority of Americans, then so be it. However, it is when their influence exceeds the numbers that they represent that I have a problem. I believe that longer terms for House members would allow for more reflection regarding the nation's direction between elections and less immediate fund-raising pressure.
Regarding Mr. Barker's suggestion that Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton run for president, I will leave that decision to her. However, if President Obama learned anything from his campaign against Mrs. Clinton, being a good street fighter is sometimes necessary to beat an opponent.
In response to Mr. Kurzban, I believe that the president could have taken a firm stand in the recent debt-ceiling debate by threatening to unilaterally raise the ceiling, while inviting compromise. Had the Democrats stood firm behind him, those on the other side might have been forced to relent.
Ms. Shelley certainly reflects the views of many of us when she speaks of special interests controlling too much of the political process. Keeping money and power from flowing into too few hands has been a challenge and will likely continue to be so in the future.
In summary, I learned something from each letter, which made me feel as if we all have more in common than separates us.

HEADLINE: True Believers, All of Us

BYLINE: By FRANK BRUNI

 BODY:
ALMOST from the moment it was announced, Saturday's enormous prayer rally in Houston drew widespread attention and remarks -- for many reasons.
It was championed by Gov. Rick Perry of Texas, whose flirtation with the presidential race is genuine as opposed to Trump-ian. It summoned tens of thousands of evangelical Christians, with whom we journalists become triply fascinated whenever the Republican primaries roll around.
Above all, it presented a spectacle that -- let's be honest -- most of us in the news media don't really get. Seeking relief from the country's woes through a louder, more ardent appeal to God strikes us as too much hope invested in too magical a solution. It suspends disbelief and defies rigorous reason. 
But if we stick with this honesty thing, don't we also have to admit that to varying degrees and with varying stakes, there's magical thinking in secular life, and that it springs from a similar yearning for easy, all-encompassing answers? Didn't the debt-ceiling showdown show us that?
That battle was defined largely by the unshakable, grandiose convictions of low-taxes, small-government puritans in the House, for whom Cut, Cap and Balance wasn't so much a three-pronged wager as a holy trinity, promising salvation. While it's inarguable that government has a tropism toward waste, and while tax increases should indeed be preceded by an inquiry into other options, the adamancy of the puritans' position flew in the face of what many economists say, and it brooked no dissent. It felt more like theology than science.
''Particularly on the conservative side, we're seeing a lot of beliefs that have this faith-based quality: 'We know it's true because our ideology tells us it's true,' '' said Alan Abramowitz, a professor of political science at Emory University, when I raised the subject with him on the phone last week.
Faith-based is right. We all have our religions, all of which exert a special pull -- and draw special fervor -- when apprehension runs high and confusion deep, as they do now. And if yours isn't a balanced-budget amendment and a government as lean as Christian Bale in one of his extreme-acting roles, it might well be a big fat binge of Keynesian stimulus spending. Liberals think magically, too, becoming so attached to a certain approach that they wind up advocating it less as option than as panacea.
It has always been thus, all around the world and all through history. Marxism was supposed to be the answer to everything. Prohibition was supposed to redeem America, and unionization was supposed to guarantee a decent life for workers forevermore. Not all worked out exactly as planned.
Even lesser, more specific initiatives command a reverence out of proportion with actual facts. Look at the early-education program Head Start. Unimpeachable in its goals and seemingly sound in its logic, it's one of the most celebrated, cherished antipoverty initiatives of the last half-century. Discussion about it has almost always centered on how best to protect or, ideally, expand it, because it so surely accomplishes such great good.
Except maybe it doesn't. As Joe Klein reported in Time magazine earlier this summer, a comprehensive impact study for the Department of Health and Human Services raised questions about whether Head Start in its current form had all that much lingering benefit to its participants. That the department did so little to acknowledge or publicize these findings suggests the extent to which the program is considered gospel.
In government and so much else there are a multitude of options to weigh, a plenitude of roads to take and a tendency to puff up the one actually taken, because doing so squelches second-guessing and quells doubt.
''The minute you decide to buy the Toyota, your evaluation of it goes up,'' said Jon A. Krosnick, a social psychologist at Stanford University who studies attitude formation. ''You overly romanticize it.''
The same goes for religious creeds, political theories or, for that matter, management philosophies. Corporate America embraces one eureka approach after another, be it employee ownership or management by objective or the cult of the charismatic C.E.O., and when such movements begin, ''They're considered like the invention of fire,'' said Eric Abrahamson, who teaches at Columbia University's graduate business school. ''They do everything, they work everywhere, with great consequences. Just like religions, they give a whole explanation of the world.'' That is, until they are swept aside in favor of the next movements, to be clung to as fiercely and blindingly as their predecessors.
Clarity seduces. So does simplicity. We don't want to hear that different skills produce different results in different contexts, but rather that there are ''7 Habits of Highly Effective People,'' the number specific, finite. We like to believe that triathlon training will trump genes and keep all major illness and minor sagging at bay, and that the metabolic alchemy of a cabbage-soup diet or a no-carb diet or some other diet will work wonders and obviate humdrum moderation. Magical thinking, all of it.
Want a box-office smash? Just cast Tom Hanks. (Unless it's in ''Charlie Wilson's War'' or ''Larry Crowne.'') Or get Julia Roberts. (Ditto.)
Want baseball dominance? In the early half of the last decade, the sport became obsessed with ''sabermetrics,'' an entirely fresh way of analyzing player statistics to predict future performance. It's the subject of the Michael Lewis best seller ''Moneyball,'' a movie version of which, starring Brad Pitt, is expected this fall. Sabermetrics survives and is used today, but it lost the holy-grail aura once accorded it. Tellingly, its zenith coincided with a time of much angst in baseball over the disparate financial resources of big-city and small-city teams. It was supposed to make the latter more competitive. It was supposed to proffer the prescriptive.
And right now, with the stock market floundering and our credit rating downgraded and millions of Americans stranded in unemployment and Washington frozen in confusion, the temptation to look for one summary prescriptive -- for certainty, even miracles -- is strong. We'd be wise to resist it. To get us out of this mess, we need a full range of extant remedies, a tireless search for new ones and the nimbleness and open-mindedness to evaluate progress dispassionately and adapt our strategy accordingly. Faith and prayer just won't cut it. In fact, they'll get in the way.

HEADLINE: The Truth About Taxes: There is no credible budget fix without more money coming in

 BODY:
A week later and we are still amazed at how the Republicans in Congress pulled it off. They held the economy hostage, won some cheap political points, and all of us will spend the next decade paying the ransom as government programs -- $900 billion over 10 years in the first round -- are slashed and the recovery is put at risk.
The only glimmer of hope is that the battle is not completely over -- if President Obama is finally willing to fight. 
Under the terms of the ill-conceived debt agreement, Congress has to propose another $1.5 trillion in deficit reduction measures by December. Just to ensure that rationality does not have a chance, Republican leaders said they would not put anyone on the deficit-cutting ''super-committee'' who might entertain the idea of raising taxes.
A week later and we are even more amazed by the failure of Mr. Obama and the Democratic leadership to stand up to this intransigence. If they do not start pushing back, with the same ferocity, the results will be disastrous.
Standard & Poor's made its judgment about both the political standoff and the all-cuts, no-new-revenues deal on Friday when it lowered the country's long-term debt rating one notch, down from AAA. And while ''no new taxes'' pledges are almost always big political winners, Americans are also figuring out that the country cannot keep on this way. According to the latest New York Times/CBS News Poll, 63 percent support raising taxes on households that earn more than $250,000 a year to help address the deficit.
If that is not enough to energize the White House, here are a few more facts. To avoid across-the-board cuts, Congress must enact at least another $1.2 trillion in deficit reduction measures over the 10 years. For all of the talk of ''big government,'' there is no way to cut that much in discretionary programs without crippling basic functions. Lawmakers could eliminate the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Pell Grants, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the National Institutes of Health and Head Start and still not cut $110 billion annually.
Entitlement reform is essential. But it is unlikely that lawmakers will agree on deep cuts to Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security. Finally, asserting that deficits can be tamed with spending cuts alone ignores that the Bush tax cuts -- costing $1.8 trillion from 2002 to 2009 -- are a big reason we got into this deep hole.
Here is the bottom line. There is no economically sensible or politically honest way to address the deficit without also increasing revenues and reforming the tax code. The major challenges are these:
LET THE BUSH CUTS EXPIRE Mr. Obama vowed to let the high-end tax cuts (for people making more than $250,00) expire in 2010. But in a preview of the debt fight, he agreed to extend the cuts for two more years when Republicans held unemployment benefits and other measures hostage.
Letting all of the cuts expire at the end of 2012 would save $3.8 trillion over the next decade. Letting the tax cuts expire for those making more than $250,000 would save $700 billion. That would make a real dent in the $2.4 trillion in total deficit reduction envisioned in the debt limit deal.
A sensible and fair approach would be to let the high-end tax cuts expire as scheduled, but keep the other tax cuts for another year. That would keep more cash in the hands of people most likely to spend it and prop up consumer demand while the economy is weak. It would give Congress and the administration time to undertake tax reform.
MAKE REAL REFORMS Most Congressional Republicans are willing to embrace reform, but only if it is ''revenue neutral.'' There is no question that the system is overly complicated; it is also riddled with hugely costly special deals for special interests. Any reform must streamline the code, make it fairer and -- most important -- raise more revenue.
TARGET TAX BREAKS AND LOWER RATES Each year, the government provides $1 trillion in tax breaks. Some of the largest breaks -- for itemized deductions and retirement savings -- should be retained because they subsidize important goals, like home ownership and old-age security. Right now, wealthier taxpayers get the greatest benefit. The process needs to be reformed so that most of the help flows to those who most need it: low- and middle-income taxpayers.
At the same time, super-low tax rates for investment income should be ended. Capital gains are taxed at a top rate of 15 percent, compared with a top rate for wages and salary of 35 percent. Proponents argue that the lower rate is an incentive to invest, but research shows that it also encourages gaming of the system. Tax breaks that have outlived their purpose must be ended, starting with subsidies for the oil industry, which is making billions in profits.
The revenue from such reforms could be used to pay down the deficit and allow all tax rates to be lowered, improving incentives to work. The amount of revenue raised and the drop in tax rates will depend on how much tax breaks are curbed.
OTHER TAXES Congress should consider raising revenues in other ways, like a value-added tax, or carbon taxes. That way all of the needed revenue for deficit reduction, and for what government provides, does not need to be squeezed from the income tax. A value-added tax is conducive to saving, and a carbon tax helps protect the environment.
The public is open to new taxes, and the economic facts are clear. Until tax increases are considered in equal measure to spending cuts, there will be no budget fix.

HIGHLIGHT: For lobstermen on the Long Island Sound, going out to fish is a labor of love. Barton Silverman found that photographing their plight took a special place in his heart.

 BODY:
Last fall, on a visit to his nearby Long Island fish shop, the New York Times staff photographer Barton Silverman placed an order for some lobster.
"I've just got a couple of Maine and Canadian lobsters," came the response.
"How come you don't have any local lobsters?" asked Mr. Silverman, a lobster lover who claims to have eaten the fiery-red crustaceans "morning, lunch and dinner" on a trip to Bar Harbor in Maine.
The answer was simple: "They don't exist anymore."
So Mr. Silverman and his wife brought some Maine-born lobsters home. But he filed the conversation away. When his editors invited staff photographers to pitch photo stories for the Metro Section, Mr. Silverman returned to those words.
They don't exist anymore?
Some research online led him to articles on the Long Island Sound's huge, three-day lobster die-off in September 1999. With the help of New York Sea Grant, Mr. Silverman tracked down a group of lobstermen who meet at Land and Sea Fish Market/Restaurant in Mount Sinai, N.Y.
It took time for the lobstermen to welcome the photographer. But eventually, he earned their trust. They invited him to their June meeting. Some began calling him to tell him their stories. Mr. Silverman began to see the story from another perspective - not that of a hungry seafood connoisseur, but that of a struggling entrepreneur.
In the late spring, he arranged to head out on the water with Phil Karlin, a longtime lobsterman, and his grandson, Carl Nickerson. On the first trip, they didn't pull up any lobsters. On the second, there were only a handful of "keepers."
"It's a labor of love," Mr. Silverman said. "Even though they're not making a living, they love being out there."

HEADLINE: Downgrade Debate Moves to Talk Shows

BYLINE: CHARLIE SAVAGE


HIGHLIGHT: Representatives of the Republican and Democratic parties went on television on Sunday morning to blame the other side for Standard &#038; Poor's unprecedented decision to downgrade the credit rating of the United States.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON - Representatives of the Republican and Democratic parties went on television on Sunday morning to blame the other side for Standard & Poor's unprecedented decision to downgrade the credit rating of the United States - a decision that was based largely on a lack of faith in the ability of the political system to forge agreements to reduce the debt.
On the ABC program "This Week," Gov. Martin O'Malley of Maryland, the chairman of the Democratic Governors Association, said that while he did not agree with the basis for the downgrade, he found it understandable in light of the Republican Party's refusal to agree to any tax increases to "balance" spending cuts.
"One has to find understandable their pessimism about our inability to come together on the most important issue facing our country, which is how do we create jobs," he said, referring to analysts at S.& P. "We need a balanced approach and the extremism, the Tea Party obstructionism here in Washington, is keeping us from restoring that balanced approach America has always used of investing in the future, investing in job creation, and also being fiscally responsible at the same time."
On the same program, however, Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama, the top Republican on the Senate Budget Committee, said that Democrats were "in denial" about the scope of the debt problem, and suggested a 10 percent "across the board" cut in the budgets of federal departments and agencies. He rejected Democrats' call for a "balanced" approach that would combine cuts with ending certain tax breaks or raising some tax rates.
"Raising taxes is what 'balanced plan' means, that is plain to every American by now," Mr. Sessions said. "The administration wants to raise taxes so they can permanently implant a larger level of spending. They have increased domestic discretionary spending 24 percent in two years. This is unthinkable. So we've got a problem -- we've got to bring that spending down, not increase the burden on the private sector."
On the CBS program "Face the Nation," Mr. Obama's longtime political adviser, David Axelrod, made clear that Democrats would seek to brand the rating as a "Tea Party downgrade." He said Mr. Obama had been willing to compromise on issues sacred to liberals by curbing spending on entitlements, but the deal foundered because "Republicans are having to respond to this very, very strident group that is pulling them away and believes that compromise is a dirty word. That is a prescription for failure."
But minutes later on the same program, Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, said the country's fiscal woes were not the fault of the Tea Party. Rather, he said the anti-spending movement within the Republican Party was playing a positive role.
"The Tea Party hasn't destroyed Washington -- Washington was destroyed before the Tea Party got there," Mr. Graham said. "The hope is that the Tea Party and middle-of-the-road people can find common ground to turn this country around before we become Greece. I hope we can."
Mr. Graham also sparred with Howard Dean, the former Vermont governor and former chairman of the Democratic National Committee, about whether the country needs to raise taxes - rather than just cut spending on programs for the poor and elderly -- as part of the long-term debt solution. Mr. Dean said that 60 percent of the deficit was the result of to tax cuts approved during the Bush administration.
"I think the Standard & Poor's downgrade is a good thing because I think it underlines the fact that you cannot get out of this without raising revenues," Mr. Dean said. "You cannot get out of this without raising revenues. It is impossible, and the vast majority of the American people want us to raise revenues -- particularly on all those gazillionaires the Republican tax cuts mostly benefit."
But Mr. Graham said that raising taxes would hurt the economy.
"People are not creating jobs in this country because they think Howard Dean is going to raise their taxes," Mr. Graham said. "If you want to create jobs, don't raise anyone's taxes. Try to lower spending like the Tea Party and other people up here want."
Elsewhere, on "Fox News Sunday," Representative Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin, the Republican chairman of the House Budget Committee, said he saw the downgrade as vindicating the actions of House Republicans and their proposals for sharply reduced spending, including a budget plan Mr. Ryan wrote that would have replaced Medicare with a system of vouchers to help purchase private insurance.
"Clearly, I'm not very surprised by this downgrade," Mr. Ryan said. "We more or less saw this coming because we're on the wrong fiscal path. We'll find out tomorrow what kind of spike in rates we're going to get. But, obviously, not only does it hurt the federal government in its ability to close the deficits, but it hurts people. You know, car loans, home loans, all these things are going to go up. And so, it's because Washington has not gotten its fiscal house in order. To me, this is more vindications of our action."
The validity of the Standard & Poor's decision to downgrade the debt received bipartisan criticism on the CNN program "State of the Nation." Steve Forbes, the chief executive of the company that publishes Forbes magazine and a former Republican presidential candidate, portrayed the move as based in politics rather than economic reality.
"I think it's really -- it'll sound strange for me to say it -- an outrageous move," Mr. Forbes said. "The government can pay its debts. It's legally obligated to do so. It's got the wherewithal to do it. In a larger sense about the economy, I think the U.S. economy is in a perilous state. This recovery has been the worst from a severe recession since the Great Depression, but I am surprised S.& P. would play politics. The U.S. government can pay the interest and principle on the bonds."
Speaking on the same program, Lawrence D. Summers, the former director of Mr. Obama's National Economics Council, agreed, saying "there is nothing good to say about what they've done" and noting that the billionaire investor Warren Buffett also disagreed with the downgrade.
Mr. O'Malley also said he did not think the downgrade was justified, pointing to what the Obama administration has portrayed as an initial $2 trillion error in the math of its explanation on Friday for its decision. He argued that "the other agencies didn't downgrade the U.S. debt because they didn't make that $2 trillion mistake."
Separately on "This Week," the host, Christiane Amanpour, interviewed John B. Chambers, the managing director of Standard & Poor's, about the downgrade. She asked Mr. Chambers about the accounting error in its assessment, but he sidestepped the question by noting that the agency had been warning of problems for months.
On "Fox News Sunday," David Beers, the head of S.& P.'s government debt rating unit, also defended the move. He acknowledged that the agency modified its projections after the Treasury Department pointed out the error in its calculations, but said "it doesn't change the fact that in our estimation, that even with the agreement of Congress and the administration this past week, that the underlying debt burden of the U.S. government is rising and will continue to rise most likely over the next decade."
Mr. Chambers also noted that five other countries had regained the top AAA credit rating after a downgrade like the one that was handed to the United States, but that it took between 9 and 18 years for them to do so.
"It takes awhile," he said. "Our concerns are centered on the political side and on the fiscal side. It would take a stabilization of the debt as a share of the economy and eventual decline, and it would take, I think, more ability to reach consensus in Washington than what we're observing now."

HEADLINE: Voters Want a Change Politicians Can't Deliver

BYLINE: JOHN HARWOOD


HIGHLIGHT: The bad news for President Obama and incumbents in both parties is that voters expect a return to the postwar economic conditions that cannot be repeated.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON - Here is the bad news forPresident Obama and incumbents in both parties: it can get worse - and stay that way for a long time.
That might sound like catastrophic thinking after Mr. Obama's nerve-jangling birthday week, during which he got several gag gifts: a near default, a 500-point market drop and the first-ever downgrade of United States debt by a major credit ratings agency.
But step back from events this month, this year or even this decade, and a more ominous portrait comes into focus.
It shows an American economy under ever-increasing competitive pressure, demographic trends making those pressures more acute and a voting public facing repeated disappointment as it yearns for better times.
That disappointment may represent the long-term political consequence of a financial crisis and recession that has forced the nation to finally come to terms with its economic vulnerability.
For a generation, "our economy has been, for the majority of people, a slow-growth economy," said Robert D. Reischauer, who was the director of the Congressional Budget Office in the early 1990s. "But our standards of living have improved much more, due to some factors that can't and won't be repeated."
Republicans felt the voters' wrath in 2008, as Democrats did last year. There is no sign of a Morning in America in 2012, or anytime soon.
"We're going to see turbulence" in more elections, Mr. Reischauer concluded. "It's a very grim picture."
Then and Now
Any American economy would suffer compared with the one that emerged as a dominant force after World War II. In 1960, according to the World Bank, the United States accounted for 39 percent of global economic output.
Millions of soldiers came home to attend college under the G.I. Bill, lifting worker productivity and expanding the suburban middle class. Annual economic growth topped 5 percent four times each in the 1950s, '60s and '70s.
Those trend lines eventually turned down. But changes in American society helped mask the effects.
While international competition shrank the American share of the global economy, women poured into the work force and gave more and more families two breadwinners instead of one.
While men's median income declined slightly between 1970 and 1990, the median income for women rose nearly 50 percent. So household income rose.
While overall growth slowed - the economy expanded at least 5 percent in a year just once in the 1980s, and not since - so did the rate at which Americans had children. Smaller families stretched family incomes further.
And as increases in education and the number of women in the work force reached a plateau, cheap and easy credit encouraged Americans to consume more. So did the "wealth effect" from the Internet-fueled stock market of the 1990s, and the real estate boom after that.
From 1980 to 2005, personal savings as a proportion of disposable income shrank to 1.5 percent from 9.8 percent. All the while, politicians and voters grew accustomed to more government services than they were willing to pay for.
"The 2007-2009 collapse brought this era to an end," Mr. Reischauer said. In the new one, ordinary Americans "are going to be very frustrated, because the political system can't deliver the rising economic performance and living standards they've come to expect."
Electoral Turmoil
That does not mean that Mr. Obama will lose his bid for re-election, though his approval rating in a New York Times/CBS News Poll last week remained 2 percentage points below the 50 percent mark.
Nor does it mean that Republicans will lose their House majority, even though the same survey showed a record 82 percent voter disapproval of Congress.
Given the advantages of incumbency, even sluggish growth and a glacial decline in the 9.1 percent unemployment rate could preserve the current divided government.
"Americans traditionally are much more interested in the direction the economy's going than in the absolute level," said Mark Mellman, a Democratic pollster. "The absolute level can be not so good, unemployment can be relatively high, and incumbents can still get re-elected as long as things are moving in the right direction."
But it does suggest that after "change" elections in 2006, 2008 and 2010, stability is no longer the presumption.
Thus, most incumbents enter each contest on the defensive - from intraparty rebels in primaries if not from the other party in general elections. The opening for a third-party insurgency has grown wider should an independent candidate emerge with the right profile and financial backing.
"It's a problem for everybody in office," said Tom Davis, a former chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee who describes himself as happily retired from the House.
"The political system, Republican or Democrat, over the last decade has delivered two failed wars, an economic meltdown, 20 percent of homes underwater, stagnant wages," he said. "Voters look at the political system as a whole as just not giving them anything."

HEADLINE: Credibility, Chutzpah And Debt

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN

 BODY:
To understand the furor over the decision by Standard & Poor's, the rating agency, to downgrade U.S. government debt, you have to hold in your mind two seemingly (but not actually) contradictory ideas. The first is that America is indeed no longer the stable, reliable country it once was. The second is that S.& P. itself has even lower credibility; it's the last place anyone should turn for judgments about our nation's prospects.
Let's start with S.& P.'s lack of credibility. If there's a single word that best describes the rating agency's decision to downgrade America, it's chutzpah -- traditionally defined by the example of the young man who kills his parents, then pleads for mercy because he's an orphan. 
America's large budget deficit is, after all, primarily the result of the economic slump that followed the 2008 financial crisis. And S.& P., along with its sister rating agencies, played a major role in causing that crisis, by giving AAA ratings to mortgage-backed assets that have since turned into toxic waste.
Nor did the bad judgment stop there. Notoriously, S.& P. gave Lehman Brothers, whose collapse triggered a global panic, an A rating right up to the month of its demise. And how did the rating agency react after this A-rated firm went bankrupt? By issuing a report denying that it had done anything wrong.
So these people are now pronouncing on the creditworthiness of the United States of America?
Wait, it gets better. Before downgrading U.S. debt, S.& P. sent a preliminary draft of its press release to the U.S. Treasury. Officials there quickly spotted a $2 trillion error in S.& P.'s calculations. And the error was the kind of thing any budget expert should have gotten right. After discussion, S.& P. conceded that it was wrong -- and downgraded America anyway, after removing some of the economic analysis from its report.
As I'll explain in a minute, such budget estimates shouldn't be given much weight in any case. But the episode hardly inspires confidence in S.& P.'s judgment.
More broadly, the rating agencies have never given us any reason to take their judgments about national solvency seriously. It's true that defaulting nations were generally downgraded before the event. But in such cases the rating agencies were just following the markets, which had already turned on these problem debtors.
And in those rare cases where rating agencies have downgraded countries that, like America now, still had the confidence of investors, they have consistently been wrong. Consider, in particular, the case of Japan, which S.& P. downgraded back in 2002. Well, nine years later Japan is still able to borrow freely and cheaply. As of Friday, in fact, the interest rate on Japanese 10-year bonds was just 1 percent.
So there is no reason to take Friday's downgrade of America seriously. These are the last people whose judgment we should trust.
And yet America does have big problems.
These problems have very little to do with short-term or even medium-term budget arithmetic. The U.S. government is having no trouble borrowing to cover its current deficit. It's true that we're building up debt, on which we'll eventually have to pay interest. But if you actually do the math, instead of intoning big numbers in your best Dr. Evil voice, you discover that even very large deficits over the next few years will have remarkably little impact on U.S. fiscal sustainability.
No, what makes America look unreliable isn't budget math, it's politics. And please, let's not have the usual declarations that both sides are at fault. Our problems are almost entirely one-sided -- specifically, they're caused by the rise of an extremist right that is prepared to create repeated crises rather than give an inch on its demands.
The truth is that as far as the straight economics goes, America's long-run fiscal problems shouldn't be all that hard to fix. It's true that an aging population and rising health care costs will, under current policies, push spending up faster than tax receipts. But the United States has far higher health costs than any other advanced country, and very low taxes by international standards. If we could move even part way toward international norms on both these fronts, our budget problems would be solved.
So why can't we do that? Because we have a powerful political movement in this country that screamed ''death panels'' in the face of modest efforts to use Medicare funds more effectively, and preferred to risk financial catastrophe rather than agree to even a penny in additional revenues.
The real question facing America, even in purely fiscal terms, isn't whether we'll trim a trillion here or a trillion there from deficits. It is whether the extremists now blocking any kind of responsible policy can be defeated and marginalized.

HEADLINE: Sharp Rift In a Strike At Verizon

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE

 BODY:
The decision by 45,000 workers at Verizon Communications businesses to go on strike Sunday over proposed benefit cuts reflects sharp battle lines. On one side is a highly profitable telecommunications company that is eager to trim costs in its declining businesses; on the other are unionized workers who fear that the many concessions demanded by their employer will force them to give up decades of hard-won gains.
The walkout is unusual at a time when unemployment is steep and organized labor has lost several big battles. But union leaders are angry that Verizon has budged little from its long list of demands during six weeks of negotiations. The unions have resisted Verizon's requests for concessions on scores of issues because the company has been very profitable overall, with net income of $6.9 billion in the first six months of this year. 
Verizon notes that most of its lines of business that deliver services over wires -- the part of the company where the striking workers are employed -- are in decline. The bulk of the company's profits come from Verizon Wireless, a thriving, nonunion joint venture that is majority-owned by Verizon.
The strike is the largest in the nation since 74,000 General Motors workers walked out for two days in 2007, although some union leaders warned that the Verizon strike could last much longer because the two sides remain far apart.
Union leaders and workers said the walkout would inevitably cause significant delays in phone repairs and in installations of its fast-growing FiOS television and Internet services in customers' homes. But Verizon officials said the company had tens of thousands of managers ready to step in to do the work normally done by the striking workers.
Verizon's chief executive, Lowell C. McAdam, took a hard line on Sunday, arguing that workers in Verizon's heavily unionized wireline businesses must agree to cost reductions. The wireline businesses, which include home and business telephone landlines as well as the FiOS services, have had declines in their customer base and profitability in the last decade, amid growing competition from mobile phones, cable companies and services like Skype and Vonage.
''It is clear that some of the existing contract provisions, negotiated initially when Verizon was under far less competitive pressure, are not in line with the economic realities of business today,'' Mr. McAdam wrote in a letter on Sunday to the company's management to discuss the strike. ''As the U.S. automobile industry found out a few years ago, failure to make needed adjustments -- when the need for change is obvious -- can be catastrophic.''
The strike involves Verizon repair technicians, FiOS installers and call center workers from Massachusetts to Virginia. The walkout was called by the Communications Workers of America, which represents 35,000 of the strikers, and the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, which represents 10,000.
Verizon wants the unionized workers to start contributing to their health care premiums, including $1,300 to $3,000 a year toward family coverage. The company has also called for freezing pension contributions for current employees, eliminating traditional pensions for future workers, limiting sick days to five a year, and eliminating all job security provisions.
''What they're asking is hard for us to swallow because the company had profits of $22 billion over the last four years,'' said Joe Iorio, a field technician based in Brooklyn, who has worked for Verizon for 15 years. ''They're crying poverty, they say they can't afford to pay us. We're just not going to stand for it anymore.''
Several union members said they were insulted that they were being asked to make deep concessions when Verizon's top five executives received a total of $258 million in compensation, including stock options, over the last four years.
Verizon says its unionized employees are well paid, with many field technicians earning more than $90,000 a year, including overtime, with an additional $50,000 in benefits. Union officials say the field technicians and call center workers generally earn $60,000 to $77,000 a year before overtime and that benefits come to far less than $50,000 a year.
Michael Parker, executive vice president for a communications workers' local in Annapolis, Md., said it was not easy to go on strike. ''It's a scary thing -- we have 45,000 families that don't have income coming in,'' he said. ''But we have to draw a line in the sand and defend what we believe in. We bargained for 50 years to gain these things, and we don't want to give that back.''
Jeff Kagan, founder of a telecommunications research firm in Georgia, said the strike would undoubtedly slow construction of Verizon's FiOS network and installation of FiOS in homes, but the short-term hit was worth it to Verizon.
''Their traditional local phone business is shrinking, while the other parts of the business are still growing,'' he said. ''It's just a matter of restructuring so they can remain competitive. If they're not competitive, Verizon will lose business and everyone loses -- investors, customers and workers.''
Richard Hurd, a professor of labor relations at Cornell, said the two unions felt Verizon was trying to humble them by pushing them to adopt some of the same, less generous benefits that many of the company's 135,000 nonunion workers have. ''When you challenge unions like that, in a sense the company is pushing them into a strike,'' he said.
In 2000, Verizon had another big strike, when 86,000 workers walked out for two weeks, causing widespread delays in repairs.
As recently as Wednesday, union and Verizon officials said they thought a strike was highly unlikely. But several union officials said on Sunday that they were stunned that Verizon still had 100 proposals for concessions on the negotiating table on Saturday, including ones to eliminate Martin Luther King Jr.'s birthday and Veterans Day as holidays.
''No one expected six weeks of bargaining would produce absolutely no movement or compromise by the company,'' said Robert Master, a communications workers spokesman. ''This was an unprecedented situation.''
Verizon officials have repeatedly said that the two unions broke off talks on Sunday, but union officials said they have asked for new meetings, and Verizon has refused.

HEADLINE: Europe Pledges Vigorous Action To Calm Markets

BYLINE: By JACK EWING; Judy Dempsey contributed reporting from Berlin, and Liz Alderman from Paris.

 BODY:
FRANKFURT -- The European Central Bank signaled on Sunday that it would intervene more aggressively in bond markets to protect Spain and Italy, and leading finance ministers conferred about the mounting threats to the world's economies, as policy makers sought to calm markets unnerved by deteriorating public finances and slow economic growth.
The shock of the downgrade Friday of long-term United States government debt and the worsening situation in Europe added new urgency to the efforts to restore confidence and prevent an extension of the stock market slide that began last week.
After conducting an emergency conference call late Sunday, the European Central Bank said it would ''actively implement'' its bond-buying program to address ''dysfunctional market segments,'' while welcoming efforts by Spain and Italy to restructure their economies and cut spending. The bank did not identify which bonds it would buy, but its statement is likely to be interpreted as a sign that it will intervene to prevent borrowing costs for the two countries from growing unsustainable. 
The move was a concession that Europe's previous efforts to stanch its debt crisis have fallen short, and underscored the importance of propping up Spain and Italy. Those two countries are central pillars of the euro zone, unlike the countries on the periphery -- Portugal, Greece and Ireland -- that have already received bailouts, and their collapse would threaten the euro currency and intensify the turbulence in world markets.
Shortly afterward, finance officials from the Group of 7 nations -- including Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner and the Federal Reserve chairman, Ben S. Bernanke -- held a conference call to discuss the United States downgrade and other challenges. In a statement issued after the nearly two-hour meeting, the group said it was ready to ''take all necessary measures to support financial stability and growth.''
Earlier Sunday, the Obama adminstration announced that Mr. Geithner would be staying on as secretary, a move whose timing appeared intended to reassure nervous investors.
As officials huddled to discuss strategy, traders and investors around the world also prepared for the fallout from the downgrade of the United States' credit rating, as markets in Asia neared their opening Monday. Although many experts said the impact in the bond market would not be as stark as first feared, the ruling by Standard & Poor's on Friday has already unnerved global stock markets.
Shares across the Middle East fell sharply Sunday, with stocks in Israel falling 7 percent, the steepest daily fall in more than a decade. United States stock futures were lower, as well.
Stock markets in the Asia-Pacific region fell Monday, with the Nikkei index in Japan down 1.3 percent at midday, and the price of gold -- considered a safe haven at times of uncertainty -- jumped to yet another nominal record high, to more than $1,688, underscoring the lingering anxiety. Futures on the Standard & Poor's 500 were 1.8 percent lower, and the price of oil sagged $3 a barrel.
After the G-7 conference call, Yoshihiko Noda, the Japanese finance minister, told reporters that global markets' trust in both United States Treasuries and the dollar remained ''unshaken.''
With signs of slowing growth in the United States and Europe, and government budgets and central bank balance sheets already stretched to the limit, the options for policy makers are dwindling. ''None of them have a lot of things to do to alleviate the crisis,'' Carl B. Weinberg, chief economist of High Frequency Economics in Valhalla, N.Y., said Sunday. ''Fiscal stimulus is not an option right now.''
In addition, it was not clear whether Washington would be able to break out of its partisan stalemate and produce in the next few months the kind of overarching deficit reduction that credit agencies and the markets will most likely demand.
''I just keep asking for the sake of the economy: can't we wait on the things that we're going to yell at each other about and start on the things that we agree on,'' Austan Goolsbee, chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, said on NBC's ''Meet the Press.''
In an interview with CNBC on Sunday, Mr. Geithner emphasized how critical it was for lawmakers to put aside their differences. ''Congress ultimately owns the credit rating of the United States,'' he said. ''They have the power of the purse of the Constitution. And they're going to have a chance now to earn back the confidence of the investors around the world.''
The country, he said, ''is much stronger than Washington.''
This week the focus may shift to policy makers at the Federal Reserve, who meet on Tuesday, but their options are narrower than they have been at other moments of turbulence in global markets. Short-term interest rates are already near zero, and cannot be lowered further, while long-term rates are also at historic lows.
Another series of huge purchases of government bonds and other assets -- so-called quantitative easing -- remains an option, but two earlier rounds have done little to bolster consumer confidence or economic growth.
Some analysts said that Italy, which is fast losing investor confidence, posed a threat to the financial system too great for any one economic superpower to cope with alone, and that a coordinated effort was needed. ''They just can't allow the Italian economy to go down the tubes,'' Uri Dadush, a senior associate at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said Sunday. ''It would be a Lehman-type situation.'' He was referring to the collapse of the investment bank Lehman Brothers in September 2008, which helped to touch off the global financial crisis.
Mr. Dadush put the cost of a bailout of Italy, the third-largest economy in the euro zone, at $1.4 trillion, with Spain requiring $700 billion. Those sums are far beyond the capability of the Continent's current rescue fund. Mr. Weinberg and other analysts said that bond buying by the European Central Bank was likely to provide only temporary relief. The bank's intervention in the much smaller market for Greek bonds failed to prevent a de facto default.
''This is just a Band-Aid to show the markets they are doing something,'' Mr. Weinberg said.
European leaders nevertheless sought to offer their own reassurances to the markets. Late Sunday, the governments of France and Germany issued a joint statement promising to quickly enact the expanded bailout package for Greece that they agreed to last month. They also praised efforts by Spain and Italy to improve their finances and competitiveness.
The central bank intervened in European bond markets last week for the first time since March. But it appeared that it was buying relatively small amounts of Portuguese and Irish bonds.
The bank may have intended this to signal its resolve, but markets seemed to have interpreted the modest intervention as a sign of weakness, creating pressure for a bolder move. The bank's vigorous response Sunday was a significant escalation of the milder intervention of the past.
Markets are likely to quickly test how far the central bank will go to protect Italy and Spain. Even the bank would be hard-pressed to buy enough bonds to hold down yields on Spanish and Italian debt in the long term, and prevent the countries' borrowing costs from reaching levels that would eventually prove ruinous, analysts said.
European governments have agreed to use their joint bailout fund, the European Financial Stability Facility, to buy government bonds on the secondary market. But Germany will be reluctant to risk its own credit rating by committing vast funds to Spain and Italy, a move that would be politically unpopular as well.
In any event, it will be several months before the bailout fund has the resources and legal authority to begin buying bonds.

HEADLINE: After Tumultuous Week, Markets Prepare for Another: A 2nd Recession May Bite Deeper Than the First

BYLINE: By CATHERINE RAMPELL

 BODY:
If the economy falls back into recession, as many economists are now warning, the bloodletting could be a lot more painful than the last time around.
Given the tumult of the Great Recession, this may be hard to believe. But the economy is much weaker than it was at the outset of the last recession in December 2007, with most major measures of economic health -- including jobs, incomes, output and industrial production -- worse today than they were back then. And growth has been so weak that almost no ground has been recouped, even though a recovery technically started in June 2009.
''It would be disastrous if we entered into a recession at this stage, given that we haven't yet made up for the last recession,'' said Conrad DeQuadros, senior economist at RDQ Economics.
When the last downturn hit, the credit bubble left Americans with lots of fat to cut, but a new one would force families to cut from the bone. Making things worse, policy makers used most of the economic tools at their disposal to combat the last recession, and have few options available. 
Anxiety and uncertainty have increased in the last few days after the decision by Standard & Poor's to downgrade the country's credit rating and as Europe continues its desperate attempt to stem its debt crisis.
President Obama acknowledged the challenge in his Saturday radio and Internet address, saying the country's ''urgent mission'' now was to expand the economy and create jobs. And Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner said in an interview on CNBC on Sunday that the United States had ''a lot of work to do'' because of its ''long-term and unsustainable fiscal position.''
But he added, ''I have enormous confidence in the basic regenerative capacity of the American economy and the American people.''
Still, the numbers are daunting. In the four years since the recession began, the civilian working-age population has grown by about 3 percent. If the economy were healthy, the number of jobs would have grown at least the same amount.
Instead, the number of jobs has shrunk. Today the economy has 5 percent fewer jobs -- or 6.8 million -- than it had before the last recession began. The unemployment rate was 5 percent then, compared with 9.1 percent today.
Even those Americans who are working are generally working less; the typical private sector worker has a shorter workweek today than four years ago.
Employers shed all the extra work shifts and weak or extraneous employees that they could during the last recession. As shown by unusually strong productivity gains, companies are now squeezing as much work as they can from their newly ''lean and mean'' work forces. Should a recession return, it is not clear how many additional workers businesses could lay off and still manage to function.
With fewer jobs and fewer hours logged, there is less income for households to spend, creating a huge obstacle for a consumer-driven economy.
Adjusted for inflation, personal income is down 4 percent, not counting payments from the government for things like unemployment benefits. Income levels are low, and moving in the wrong direction: private wage and salary income actually fell in June, the last month for which data was available.
Consumer spending, along with housing, usually drives a recovery. But with incomes so weak, spending is only barely where it was when the recession began. If the economy were healthy, total consumer spending would be higher because of population growth.
And with construction nearly nonexistent and home prices down 24 percent since December 2007, the country does not have a buffer in housing to fall back on.
Of all the major economic indicators, industrial production -- as tracked by the Federal Reserve -- is by far the worst off. The Fed's index of this activity is nearly 8 percent below its level in December 2007.
Likewise, and perhaps most worrisome, is the track record for the country's overall output. According to newly revised data from the Commerce Department, the economy is smaller today than it was when the recession began, despite (or rather, because of) the feeble growth in the last couple of years.
If the economy were healthy, it would be much bigger than it was four years ago. Economists refer to the difference between where the economy is and where it could be if it met its full potential as the ''output gap.'' Menzie Chinn, an economics professor at the University of Wisconsin, has estimated that the economy was about 7 percent smaller than its potential at the beginning of this year.
Unlike during the first downturn, there would be few policy remedies available if the economy were to revert back into recession.
Interest rates cannot be pushed down further -- they are already at zero. The Fed has already flooded the financial markets with money by buying billions in mortgage securities and Treasury bonds, and economists do not even agree on whether those purchases substantially helped the economy. So the Fed may not see much upside to going through another politically controversial round of buying.
''There are only so many times the Fed can pull this same rabbit out of its hat,'' said Torsten Slok, the chief international economist at Deutsche Bank.
Congress had some room -- financially and politically -- to engage in fiscal stimulus during the last recession.
But at the end of 2007, the federal debt was 64.4 percent of the economy. Today, it is estimated at around 100 percent of gross domestic product, a share not seen since the aftermath of World War II, and there is little chance of lawmakers reaching consensus on additional stimulus that would increase the debt.
''There is no approachable precedent, at least in the postwar era, for what happens when an economy with 9 percent unemployment falls back into recession,'' said Nigel Gault, chief United States economist at IHS Global Insight. ''The one precedent you might consider is 1937, when there was also a premature withdrawal of fiscal stimulus, and the economy fell into another recession more painful than the first.''
There is at least one factor, though, that could make a second downturn feel milder than the first: corporate profits. Corporate profits are at record highs and, adjusted for inflation, were 22 percent greater in the first quarter of this year than they were in the last quarter of 2007.
Nervous about the future of the economy, corporations are reluctant to make big investments like hiring. As a result, they are sitting on a lot of cash.
While this may not be much comfort to the nation's 13.9 million unemployed workers, it may be to their employed counterparts.
''In the financial crisis, when markets were freezing up, the first response was, 'I've got to get some cash,' '' said Neal Soss, the chief economist at Credit Suisse. ''The fastest way to get cash is to not have a weekly payroll, so that's why we saw such big layoffs.''
Corporate cash reserves today, he said, could act as a buffer to layoffs if demand drops.
''There are arguments that another recession would be worse, and there are arguments in the other direction,'' Mr. Soss said. ''We just don't know at this juncture. But ultimately it's a question you don't want to know the answer to.''

PERSON: Hugh L. Carey 

HEADLINE: HUGH L. CAREY, 1919-2011: Governor Who Staved Off Bankruptcy

BYLINE: By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA; Frank Lynn contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Hugh L. Carey, the governor who helped rescue New York from the brink of financial collapse in the 1970s and tamed a culture of ever-growing spending, died Sunday at his summer home on Shelter Island, N.Y. He was 92.
His death was announced by the office of Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo. ''Governor Carey led our state during a time of great financial turmoil and pulled us back from the brink of bankruptcy and economic ruin,'' Mr. Cuomo said in the statement.
From 1975 through 1982, as the state's 51st governor, Mr. Carey led a small group of public servants who vanquished the fiscal crisis that threatened New York City and State -- the direst emergency a governor had faced since the Depression -- by taking on powers over the city's finances that no governor had wielded before and none has wielded since. 
A liberal Democrat, Mr. Carey reversed the upward spiral of borrowing, spending and entitlement under one of his predecessors, Nelson A. Rockefeller, a Republican who had presided in an era of limitless government promise. But even after eight years as governor, Mr. Carey remained an enigma. The witty storyteller who could charm an audience alternated with the irascible loner who alienated many of his allies. The brooding, private man, father of more than a dozen children, who mourned the deaths of his wife and, earlier, two sons killed in a car crash, gave way to a man who engaged in an exuberant, very public romance that led to a second marriage.
Hugh Carey rose to power as a Democrat outside his party's machine. He began the 1974 campaign for governor as a recently widowed congressman from Brooklyn, a long shot who was not taken seriously, yet he cruised to one of the most resounding victories in the state's history.
But he spent his final years as governor frustrated. Absent an emergency, he often seemed bored with the job.
The political strategist David Garth, who was one of Mr. Carey's closest associates, once said of him: ''Hugh Carey on the petty issues can be very petty. On the big stuff, he is terrific.''
Mr. Carey's stature grew in his decades out of office, and he was hailed as a hero by Republicans and Democrats. As he acknowledged, his handling of government finances overshadowed all else he did. In an interview in 1982 in his last days in office, he said, ''The objectives I set forth I've achieved in terms of a state that's respected fiscally, a city that's now well on its way back to concrete foundations.''
In four terms as governor, Mr. Rockefeller had built a legacy of state universities and highways but also of much higher taxes and enormous debt. The pattern was repeated at the local level; under Mayor John V. Lindsay, a Republican turned Democrat, New York City had to borrow money for day-to-day operations. The 1974-75 recession opened yawning deficits and exposed years of unsound practices.
Cascade of Emergencies
On Jan. 1, 1975, Mr. Carey declared in his inaugural address, ''This government will begin today the painful, difficult, imperative process of learning to live within its means.''
He immediately faced a cascade of emergencies, as various state authorities, New York City, Yonkers, several school districts and ultimately the state itself flirted with collapse.
New York City lay at the core of the crisis. Mr. Lindsay's successor as mayor, Abraham D. Beame, was taking drastic action, cutting tens of thousands of jobs, but a solution lay beyond the city's grasp. In May 1975, Wall Street firms refused to sell the city's bonds, threatening its ability to pay its bills.
Mr. Carey responded with a series of audacious moves to keep the city afloat. He created the Municipal Assistance Corporation to borrow money for the city. He created and headed the Emergency Financial Control Board, with the power to reject city budgets and labor contracts, giving him vast new authority at Mr. Beame's expense.
By seizing control of the city's finances, and then telling the mayor that he had to fire his closest aide to placate the bankers, Mr. Carey permanently soured his relationship with Mr. Beame, who had helped him get elected. But such tough measures were necessary to keep the enterprise afloat. Felix G. Rohatyn, the investment banker whom the governor appointed to head the Municipal Assistance Corporation, later said of Mr. Carey, ''He was the only one who had any credibility left.''
The governor engineered more than $1 billion in state loans to the city and $200 million in new city taxes. He persuaded banks to refinance city debts and accept a moratorium on some debt payments, and he got municipal unions to invest their pension funds in Municipal Assistance Corporation bonds.
Despite those measures, New York City at one point came within hours having to file for bankruptcy.
On Oct. 29, 1975, President Gerald R. Ford vowed that he would veto ''any bill that has as its purpose a federal bailout of New York City.'' The next day, the front page of The Daily News famously proclaimed: ''Ford to City: Drop Dead.''
A fierce backlash ensued, and a chastened Mr. Ford was persuaded that the governor had the situation under control. The president agreed in early 1976 to $2.3 billion in federal loan guarantees to the city. The greatest peril had passed.
In all, Mr. Carey wrought profound changes, curtailing the entitlements that had been a defining element of New York government. The state wrested primary control of the City University of New York from the city, ending tuition-free education. It took over the city's courts. Subway and bus fares were raised and raised again, and welfare payments were frozen despite high inflation.
In his first five years, Mr. Carey reduced state spending 13 percent when adjusted for inflation, and despite increases forced on him by the Legislature in later years, the budget was smaller in real terms when he left office than when he arrived. He cut state taxes, and city taxes declined over all as well. And most striking, the city and state eliminated more than 100,000 jobs.
Outside the fiscal realm, Mr. Carey promised an era of openness and clean government. He mandated financial disclosure for top state officials, barred party leaders from holding major state posts and signed campaign finance laws that set limits and required disclosure. He secured voter approval of a constitutional amendment providing for appointment, rather than election, of judges to the Court of Appeals, New York's highest court, a change that was viewed as insulating the court from politics.
He ordered an investigation of nursing homes that resulted in the convictions of several nursing-home operators and workers on fraud charges, and the recovery of millions of dollars in government payments. And he helped bring the Democratic National Convention to Madison Square Garden for the first time in a half-century in 1976 and again in 1980.
Like so many New York governors, Mr. Carey harbored presidential ambitions, but trouble at home doomed any hope he might have had. His austerity measures made him unpopular with many voters, and his support for Westway, a proposed highway along the West Side of Manhattan, made more enemies than friends.
Unprecedented Affront
In 1978, when Mr. Carey ran for a second term, he was challenged in the primary by his own lieutenant governor, Mary Anne Krupsak, an unheard-of affront to a sitting governor. He began the general election campaign lagging in polls behind the Republican candidate, Perry B. Duryea, a former Assembly speaker. But capitalizing on Mr. Duryea's refusal to disclose his personal finances, he managed a narrow victory.
Mr. Carey could be remarkably free of egotism, sharing credit liberally with others and readily deferring to his aides. He brought into government an impressive cadre of people who cast long shadows years after he had left office, including Mario M. Cuomo, his second lieutenant governor, who succeeded him as governor (and whose son is the current governor); Richard Ravitch, a lieutenant governor under Gov. David A. Paterson; and Mr. Rohatyn.
But Mr. Carey eventually feuded with nearly everyone around him, beginning with Ms. Krupsak, who felt ignored. In 1977, he helped orchestrate the downfall of his old ally, Mr. Beame, after one term as mayor. He encouraged Mario Cuomo's challenge of Mr. Beame's renomination, but Congressman Edward I. Koch defeated them both and became mayor.
Mr. Carey's relations with the Legislature turned rocky in his second term. A new Democratic speaker of the Assembly, Stanley Fink, asserted his house as an independent force.
The governor let legislators know that he considered them petty and parochial, while they accused him of being distant from the business at hand. Even Mr. Carey's detractors said he was brilliant at sizing up problems and conceiving solutions, but aides and legislators alike agreed that he had little patience for seeing them through.
In 1981 and 1982, the Legislature cut him out of the budget-making process; when he vetoed dozens of spending items, both houses overrode his vetoes. He was the first governor of New York in a century to have a veto overridden.
In 1982, the state approved the most significant legislation of his second term, an $8 billion package to restore New York City's crumbling transit system. But that was largely the doing of legislators and Mr. Ravitch, chairman of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority. The governor had been reduced to a bystander.
In his second term, Mr. Carey acquired a reputation for erratic behavior, which he attributed to people's misunderstanding his offbeat, deadpan humor. He created a furor by saying that one of New York's seats in the United States Senate had been and should remain ''a Jewish seat.'' He sought state condemnation of a neighbor's property on Shelter Island, on the East End of Long Island, over a private feud. He offered to drink a glass of PCBs to allay fears of contamination at a state office building where an electrical transformer fire had spread soot laden with the toxic chemical.
But it was his marriage to Evangeline Gouletas, a wealthy real estate investor, that made the governor seem, to many people, downright eccentric. They met at the inauguration of Ronald Reagan as president in January 1981 and married less than three months later. Ms. Gouletas said that she had been married twice before and that her first husband had died, but shortly after her wedding to Mr. Carey, reporters discovered that she had three former husbands, all quite alive.
Bon Vivant
To the dismay of his staff, the governor began dyeing his silver hair -- not always quite the same shade -- and including his wife in policy discussions. The newlyweds were often seen out dancing, and they turned up regularly at black-tie events; Mr. Carey suddenly seemed more bon vivant than sober executive.
Finally, it became clear that he would be challenged by other Democrats if he ran for a third term. Although Mr. Carey had been a prime sponsor of Mr. Cuomo's political career, their relationship had so deteriorated that Mr. Cuomo, as Ms. Krupsak had done, was considering running against his political mentor.
In January 1982, Governor Carey announced that at the end of his term later that year, at age 63, he would retire from politics. After leaving office, he became a partner in the Manhattan law firm of Finley Kumble Wagner Heine Underberg & Casey. Later he worked with other law firms and was an executive at the chemicals conglomerate W. R. Grace & Company. He and Ms. Gouletas divorced after several years. Mr. Carey quickly faded from the public eye, though he turned up occasionally at the Capitol in Albany to bask in encomiums for his handling of the fiscal crisis.
''When he focuses and buckles down to a problem, he's effective,'' Warren M. Anderson, the Republican majority leader of the State Senate, said in 1982 as Mr. Carey's second term was ending. ''I don't know why he doesn't do it more uniformly. He almost seemed to need a crisis to motivate him.''
Last year, the State Legislature voted to rename the Brooklyn-Battery Tunnel after Mr. Carey. Mr. Koch applauded the move, saying: ''I have been trying for years to get something named for Hugh Carey. I think he's the greatest governor of the modern era.''
Hugh Leo Carey was born on April 11, 1919, in Park Slope, Brooklyn, the fourth of five sons of Margaret and Denis J. Carey, both children of Irish immigrants. Denis Carey founded a successful business delivering fuel oil and kerosene, and the family lived comfortably.
Hugh Carey followed an educational path well worn by Brooklyn's Irish Catholic sons: St. Augustine's Academy and High School, St. John's College. He left school to enlist in a National Guard cavalry unit in 1939, at a time when the cavalry still rode horses. Years later he would regale upstate audiences with tales of his equestrian experiences at Camp Drum, near Watertown, providing a local touch that voters relished. When his unit was activated, he was transferred to the infantry.
He fought with the 104th Division in France, Belgium, the Netherlands and Germany, helping to capture Cologne and liberate prisoners at a concentration camp at Nordhausen. At his discharge in 1946, he was a lieutenant colonel, wearing the Bronze Star, the Croix de Guerre with Silver Star and the Combat Infantryman's Badge.
In 1947 he married Helen Owen Twohy, the widow of a Navy flier killed in the war, and adopted her daughter. They had 13 more children together and divided their time between Park Slope and a rambling white house with a wraparound porch on Shelter Island that in time became the family homestead.
Mr. Carey is survived by his daughters, Alexandria McManus, Susan Dempsey, Marianne Hayes, Nancy Cassidy and Helen O'Neill; his sons Christopher, Michael, Donald, Bryan, Kevin and Thomas; his brothers Denis, John and Martin; 25 grandchildren and 6 great grand-children.
After the war, Mr. Carey returned to St. John's, where he finished his undergraduate education and graduated from law school. He then entered the family oil business. His eldest brother, Edward, struck out on his own, creating the New England Petroleum Corporation and amassing a fortune that would help underwrite his brother's political career.
Challenging an Incumbent
In 1960, Hugh Carey ran for Congress in a Brooklyn district that stretched from Park Slope to Bay Ridge, challenging a popular Republican incumbent, Francis E. Dorn. Though Mr. Carey was not one of its own, the Democratic Party organization backed him because no one else wanted what was viewed as a hopeless assignment. Running in a strongly Catholic district in a year when John F. Kennedy was pulling Catholics to the Democratic line, Mr. Carey squeezed out a 1,097-vote victory.
In seven terms in Congress, Mr. Carey ranked high on the scorecards of liberal groups and adhered to positions like opposing the death penalty even when they were unpopular. But in keeping with the tone of his district, he portrayed himself as a moderate, playing up his support for federal aid to parochial schools.
In Congress he became one of the most influential members of the New York delegation. He sat on the House Education and Labor Committee, which handled most of the New Frontier and Great Society social welfare legislation of the Kennedy and Johnson administrations, and later on the powerful Ways and Means Committee.
But Mr. Carey became restless, and he and his wife grew tired of commuting to and from Washington with their many children.
In 1969, he ran for mayor of New York as an independent, angering Democratic Party leaders and prompting predictions of his political demise. But his sons Peter and Hugh Jr., both teenagers, were killed in a car accident on Shelter Island, and Mr. Carey abandoned the race. Another son, Paul, died of cancer in 2001.
Mr. Carey considered another run for mayor in 1973 but deferred to a fellow Brooklyn Democrat, Mr. Beame. That year, Helen Carey, who had been treated for cancer three years earlier, learned that the disease had returned, and on a family trip to Ireland, Mr. Carey decided to retire from politics.
In December 1973, however, he saw the political opening he had sought, when Mr. Rockefeller resigned as governor, leaving Lt. Gov. Malcolm Wilson to serve the year remaining on his term. Democratic Party leaders backed Howard J. Samuels, the president of the Off-Track Betting Corporation, for governor, and Mr. Carey was seen as a long shot.
On March 8, 1974, Helen Carey died. Her husband, with seven school-age children still at home, was expected to bow out of the race. But on March 26, he announced his candidacy. Friends said that as much as anything, he needed the challenge to distract him from his grief.
When he said that his brother would spend $1 million on television advertising to help his candidacy, the boast was viewed with skepticism, but Edward Carey spent that and more.
In September, he defeated Mr. Samuels with 61 percent of the vote. In November, in the national post-Watergate sweep by Democrats, Mr. Carey trounced Governor Wilson, 57 percent to 42 percent.
''All my life, people have been underestimating me,'' Mr. Carey often said. In rising to power, he repeatedly ignored the conventional wisdom and trusted his own judgment, and he would again as governor.
Years later, he told a reporter: ''A mentor long departed told me that the greatest gift in political life, in any life, is to view yourself objectively, at arm's length, to make an assessment of yourself. So whom do I rely on? I rely on myself.''

HEADLINE: With Prospect of U.S. Slowdown, Europe Fears a Worsening Debt Crisis

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER; Maia de la Baume contributed reporting.

 BODY:
PARIS -- European political leaders have garnered much of the blame for the continuing crisis of the euro, consistently failing to act with enough speed or severity to calm the markets. But the current panic has been partly produced by American politicians, whose noisy squabbling over the debt ceiling has combined with the prospect of another United States recession to undermine the potential for global growth.
It is that prospect -- that Americans will again retrench and stop buying goods from China and Europe and everywhere else -- that is putting new pressure on debt-ridden euro zone economies, most recently Italy and Spain.
Telephone lines were buzzing Sunday, with heads of government, economic ministers and central bankers from Asia to Europe to the United States discussing what might be usefully said before the markets' opening on Monday. They all seem to agree about one thing, however: the need to defend the idea that the United States remains a reliable credit risk, despite a downgrade of a notch by Standard & Poor's. 
But the United States' problems, including the probability of a double-dip recession, have depressed forecasts for growth.
''There is a real psychosis, but everything is mixed, and that creates the problem,'' said Cedric Thellier, an economist at the French investment bank Natixis. ''It's the fear of the markets, so the rates climb and a negative spiral begins.''
It is less clear how Europe can stop the downward spiral. The European Central Bank can buy some Italian and Spanish bonds, but Italy and Spain together are too big to bail out. And Europe -- dilatory and incremental, requiring unanimity -- does not do shock therapy.
Europe already has historically lower growth than the United States, and the likelihood that it will continue to slow will make the debt crisis worse. For the best way to reduce sovereign debt, everyone agrees, is through economic growth. With growth, there are more jobs and more tax receipts, adding to government revenues, while the debt shrinks as a percentage of a rising gross domestic product.
But recession puts even more pressure on governments trying to contain deficits: tax receipts drop, spending on social benefits increases and the debt rises inexorably, unless governments slash spending further, which further undercuts growth.
That is the ''debt trap'' that is dragging down Greece, Portugal and other European countries, and it is the cycle that is pushing Spain and especially Italy to the edge of default. Markets now see growth sputtering further, making those large debts larger and harder to finance, and putting at risk a number of banks holding sovereign debt. Italy can manage its debt at a 4 percent interest rate, but it becomes unaffordable when the rate is 6.5 percent on a debt that is 120 percent of gross domestic product.
As much as the American drama and talk of a new recession added to Europe's ills, Europeans themselves must accept most of the blame. The last in a series of emergency summit meetings, all intended to calm markets and end the crisis, was less than three weeks ago, on July 21. Steps taken then -- including an effective though modest restructuring of Greek debt and new powers for the bailout fund, called the European Financial Stability Facility -- seemed to calm the markets. But everyone knew that the problem was not really solved, and that the fund's new powers had to be drafted and ratified by member parliaments, which would take until autumn, and that Spain and Italy remained vulnerable.
But then came the American debt-ceiling crisis and negative growth projections. Leaders are on vacation, trading is thin and speculators have a larger impact.
As stocks fell and the markets went after Italy and Spain, there were other mistakes. Jose Manuel Barroso, president of the European Commission, made ill-advised comments, as in a letter on Thursday, when he called for a ''rapid reassessment of all elements'' related to the stability fund, so that it was ''equipped with the means for dealing with contagious risk.''
He even criticized European politicians for ''undisciplined communication,'' as if he were not doing the same. It was all food for the bear market, and it brought Mr. Barroso a rebuke from Berlin and even from his own commissioner for economics, Olli Rehn.
A spokesman for the German Finance Ministry said tartly, ''It is not clear how reopening the debate only two weeks after the summit would contribute to the calming of markets.'' At a news conference on Friday, Mr. Rehn said: ''All of us who are in responsible positions in Europe will have to do much better in order to ensure verbal discipline and rigor.''
On Thursday, the European Central Bank reluctantly began to buy sovereign debt again, but not from Italy or Spain, and Jean-Claude Trichet, the president of the central bank, acknowledged that the board was split. Some on the board suggested that not buying Spanish and Italian debt was a way to force those countries to cut deficits and enact structural reform. But even when Italy said it would balance its budget in 2013 instead of 2014, it made little difference to the markets.
Late Sunday night, after a conference call lasting hours, the central bank's governing board said it welcomed new financial stabilization efforts announced by Italy and Spain and urged their swift implementation, and it indicated that on Monday it would start buying their bonds.
As usual, the European Union is moving late, and by increments. Pressed by the markets and its own problems of aging populations, sovereign debt, inflexible labor markets, stagnant growth and especially the imbalance between north and south -- competitive countries like Germany and uncompetitive ones like Greece and Portugal -- the European Union must either move forward or backward.
Backward would mean a slow, complicated and expensive dismantling of the euro zone. Forward means ''more Europe'' -- more solidarity, more coordination of fiscal policies, of retirement ages and taxes. In the end, to keep the euro zone whole, the richer, more competitive countries will have to put their credibility and some of their cash behind the poorer ones, not just to buy their bonds but to give them time to restructure.
At each point in the crisis, the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, has responded to calls for more European and German responsibility by saying no, and then, under market and peer pressure, saying yes. At the moment, she is saying no to ''eurobonds,'' too -- bonds that would be issued with the collective responsibility of all euro zone members. There are good reasons for her to say no -- domestic politics, the German Constitutional Court and the promise that Germans would not be asked to bail out another sovereign state.
But Germany is already doing that in a more hidden way, given the new shape and abilities of the stability fund, which the chancellor only reluctantly approved last month. Mr. Rehn, the European economics commissioner, said Friday he thought eurobonds were now a good idea. Eurobonds are likely to be the next incremental step, in which Germany is forced to say yes where it had said no, in order to put the collective economic strength of the euro zone, with its 330 million people, behind all of its members.
As Finance Minister Giulio Tremonti of Italy recently warned the Germans, ''Just as on the Titanic, not even first-class passengers can save themselves.''

HEADLINE: A Law to Verify the Immigration Status of Workers

 BODY:
To the Editor:
''Farmers Oppose G.O.P. Bill to Require Verification of Workers' Immigration Status'' (news article, July 31) didn't tell the whole story. We could open up millions of jobs for unemployed Americans by requiring all employers to use E-Verify. This program quickly identifies people working illegally in the United States and protects jobs for legal workers. 
Created in 1996, E-Verify allows employers to electronically verify the work eligibility of newly hired employees by checking their Social Security numbers. The ''E'' in E-Verify could just as well stand for ''easy'' and ''effective.'' It takes only one to two minutes to use per new hire and easily confirms 99.5 percent of work-eligible employees.
Both businesses and the public support the expansion of E-Verify. Even though E-Verify is not mandatory, more than 270,000 American employers use it, and an average of 1,300 new businesses sign up each week. And according to a recent poll, 82 percent of likely voters think that all American employers should be required to use E-Verify.
With millions of citizens and legal workers looking for work, it is critical that we promote policies that help grow our economy and increase job opportunities for Americans and legal immigrants.
With a 21st-century tool already on the books, it makes sense to use it. A federal E-Verify law is the only way to ensure that all employers hire a legal work force.
LAMAR SMITH Washington, Aug. 3, 2011
The writer, a Texas Republican who is chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, is the lead sponsor of the E-Verify bill.

HEADLINE: Watching Those Who Treat the Disabled

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re ''Reaping Millions From Medicaid in Nonprofit Care for Disabled'' (''Abused and Used'' series, front page, Aug. 2), about Philip and Joel Levy, and the group they founded:
I recently toured the Young Adult Institute Network's offices and educational programs on West 34th Street in Manhattan. After looking at the beaming smiles and into the gleaming eyes of the children the group provides for, I have to say that sometimes results should not be measured solely by dollars and cents. 
No one is a fan of financial inefficiency, especially when it permeates a nonprofit world that is supported by generous donors and government agencies that rightfully deserve to see their dollars used wisely.
All nonprofit executives, including the Levys, must be accountable to their board, their supporters and the government.
If the Young Adult Institute's accomplishments are examined as a whole, however, then I think your article was biased toward embarrassing the ''Medicaid moguls.''
Instead, we should focus on the fact that our developmentally challenged citizens no longer have to worry about being sent to another Willowbrook, the notorious state-run institution that was shut down in 1987.
GEORGE CONTOS New York, Aug. 2, 2011
The writer is a member of the Young Adult Institute's business advisory council.
To the Editor:
Our younger sister is developmentally disabled and vitally needs 24-hour care. Luckily, she lives in a nonprofit home in California that provides the high-quality care she requires.
The record of the Levy brothers' organization is disturbing. Its history of paying huge compensation packages to top executives, as well as other financial acts that led to a recent settlement and penalty, certainly needed airing.
But we are worried that your article, by focusing on such an exceptional instance of fiscal irresponsibility without also discussing the vital importance of services to the developmentally disabled, could feed into the frenzy to cut state and federal funds for them.
Residential and day care programs for the developmentally disabled are among the most important government-financed services, and their high value to society may get lost in this toxic climate of cut, cut, cut.
LAURA HOFSTADTER DOUGLAS HOFSTADTER Menlo Park, Calif., Aug. 2, 2011
To the Editor:
Your article is a splendid piece of investigative reporting, and it left me with a sickening sense of outrage. In the context of the contentious budget debate in Congress, one can only hope that the disclosures it unearthed will generate enough of an uproar to spur a full investigation of those responsible for such waste of taxpayers' money.
You report that Marcella C. Fava, who led the Young Adult Institute's board for more than 20 years, called one of the perks for senior executives -- payment of their children's college tuition -- a ''retention tool.'' That is beyond belief. There would have been no shortage of financially struggling psychologists and social workers to fill those executives' jobs, especially over the past years of layoffs and high unemployment.
The Levy bothers, who started the Young Adult Institute, and others named in your article ought to be ashamed of taking advantage of the laxness of oversight in the nonprofit sector.
LEO GOLDBERGER West Stockbridge, Mass., Aug. 2, 2011
The writer is emeritus professor of psychology at New York University.
To the Editor:
A worthy sequel to this masterpiece of investigative reporting would be an article about the compensation and benefits awarded to the board members of the Young Adult Institute.
I would also like to know how Marcella C. Fava, who led the board for many years, and the other board members were chosen in the first place. And what was wrong with the state's oversight: ignorance or indifference, or perhaps something less innocent?

HEADLINE: Ad Money Reliably Goes To Television

BYLINE: By BRIAN STELTER and TANZINA VEGA

 BODY:
The economy is faltering and consumers are scared, but you wouldn't know it by watching television, where advertisers are still pouring in money.
Last week, companies like Viacom, CBS and Time Warner reported windfalls in television revenue, much of it from growing ad spending.
Every company was asked the same question by worried investors -- will the weakening economy claim television advertising -- and every company answered the same way. 
''We have not seen any deterioration in our current market conditions,'' said Brad Singer, the chief financial officer of Discovery Communications.
''We don't see any signs of a deceleration right now,'' said Stephen B. Burke, the chief executive of NBCUniversal.
''We're not at all afraid, and frankly we're looking forward to the fall,'' said Leslie Moonves, the chief executive of the CBS Corporation, referring to the start of the fall season.
Despite worries of a possible double-dip recession, so far companies are not pulling back from their television ad spending plans, demonstrating the resiliency of the medium even when faced with a downturn and the persistent threat of the Internet to steal viewers.
Television networks are coming off a robust upfront advertising period, when companies make commitments for spending in the season ahead.
While they can back away from some of those commitments a few weeks ahead of time, ''we have seen absolutely none of that,'' Mr. Moonves told analysts last week. On the contrary, he said, what CBS has seen is ''increased demand for our shows.''
That demand also has been reflected in the so-called scatter market for advertising, when companies buy commercial time during the season. The Viacom chief executive Philippe Dauman said Friday that scatter pricing was up more than 10 percent in the quarter that ended in June, driving a 12 percent gain in domestic ad sales in the spring -- and a prediction for double-digit growth this summer, too.
Media executives said in interviews that the optimism reflected the fact that television is a tried and true medium for advertisers, remaining at or near historical highs in the United States.
''In essence, it's all about sticking with something that you know is proven,'' said Chris Geraci, the president of national broadcast at OMD, a unit of the Omnicom Media Group, echoing sentiments heard during the recession in 2008.
Some companies put down more money in the upfront market this spring to guard against high scatter prices later. ''Companies are making more long-term commitments,'' he said. ''You want to just buy more efficiently.''
Other corners of the media industry -- like publishing -- may have fewer reasons to be confident about their prospects. The Washington Post on Friday said that print advertising revenues had slid by 12 percent in the second quarter, while revenue from display ads on its Web sites slid by 16 percent.
The New York Times had a 6.4 percent decline in print advertising revenues at its properties in the quarter, but a 2.6 percent increase in online advertising. The publishing arm of Time Warner managed a 1 percent uptick in ad revenue, but warned of current weakness in both advertising and newsstand sales.
Broadly speaking, forecasters have been anticipating a slight pullback in ad spending growth this year. ZenithOptimedia, part of the Publicis Groupe, said in mid-July that it thought worldwide ad spending would grow by 4.1 percent this year, down slightly from its previous forecast of 4.2 percent growth. A week earlier, the GroupM unit of WPP said it expected 4.8 percent growth this year, down from a previous forecast of 5.8 percent growth.
''There is no doubt we're seeing a slowdown in growth as we get into the second half of this year,'' Rino Scanzoni, the chief investment officer at GroupM, said in an interview last week.
Mr. Scanzoni called television one ''area of resilience'' -- driven mostly not by broadcast, but by cable -- and said that television is ''probably more favored in the media mix'' at this time. It is a medium that advertisers know, understand and can measure, he said.
Then there are the competitive pressures. ''You have to maintain your advertising even in the recession,'' said Pat McDonough, the senior vice president for insights and analysis for the Nielsen Company. ''You're likely to lose market share if you don't.''
Concerns about the economy are likely to loom large as the Walt Disney Company, Cablevision, Dish Network, and Scripps Networks report earnings on Tuesday, and as the News Corporation reports on Wednesday. Last week, the potential slowdown in the ad market was the first question posed by an analyst on the earnings conference call with Comcast, which took control of NBCUniversal this year.
''We are obviously concerned about the economy the way you would expect us to be, but so far the advertising market continues to be strong,'' Mr. Burke said.
In interviews, advertising buyers singled out the pharmaceutical and personal technology sectors as particularly good for business, and said that the automotive and financial services sectors had rebounded after suffering during the last recession.
CBS, on its earnings call last week, said that Japanese automakers that had significantly curtailed their spending after the March earthquake and tsunami were now coming back, benefiting local stations that depend on automotive revenue.
Television companies have two more advantages. One is the rise of digital distributors like Netflix that are willing and able to pay for shows.
If digital distributors can peacefully co-exist with the cable and satellite distributors that are the backbone of the business, they can be new long-term sources of incremental revenue.
''Media owners are getting better at taking their content and monetizing it beyond television,'' said Catherine Warburton, the executive vice president for national broadcast at Universal McCann, part of the Interpublic Group of Companies.
The other advantage is overseas, where their businesses are growing at a faster pace than they are in the United States. ''We've seen real meaningful demand around the world on the advertising side,'' David M. Zaslav, the chief executive of Discovery, told analysts last week.
In countries like France and Italy where Discovery has channels, ad sales make up about 35 percent of revenues, with subscription fees contributing the rest.
In the United States, ad sales make up at least 50 percent of revenues. ''We can really have a lot of growth there,'' he said of its international business.

HEADLINE: How Congress Devastated Congo

BYLINE: By DAVID ARONSON. 
David Aronson is a freelance journalist and blogger focusing on Central Africa.

 BODY:
Washington
IT'S a long way from the marble halls of Congress to the ailing mining towns of eastern Congo, but the residents of Nyabibwe and Nzibira know exactly what's to blame for their economic woes.
The ''Loi Obama'' or Obama Law -- as the Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform act of 2010 has become known in the region -- includes an obscure provision that requires public companies to indicate what measures they are taking to ensure that minerals in their supply chain don't benefit warlords in conflict-ravaged Congo. The provision came about in no small part because of the work of high-profile advocacy groups like the Enough Project and Global Witness, which have been working for an end to what they call ''conflict minerals.''
Unfortunately, the Dodd-Frank law has had unintended and devastating consequences, as I saw firsthand on a trip to eastern Congo this summer. The law has brought about a de facto embargo on the minerals mined in the region, including tin, tungsten and the tantalum that is essential for making cellphones. 
The smelting companies that used to buy from eastern Congo have stopped. No one wants to be tarred with financing African warlords -- especially the glamorous high-tech firms like Apple and Intel that are often the ultimate buyers of these minerals. It's easier to sidestep Congo than to sort out the complexities of Congolese politics -- especially when minerals are readily available from other, safer countries.
For locals, however, the law has been a catastrophe. In South Kivu Province, I heard from scores of artisanal miners and small-scale purchasers, who used to make a few dollars a day digging ore out of mountainsides with hand tools. Paltry as it may seem, this income was a lifeline for people in a region that was devastated by 32 years of misrule under the kleptocracy of Mobutu Sese Seko (when the country was known as Zaire) and that is now just beginning to emerge from over a decade of brutal war and internal strife.
The pastor at one church told me that women were giving birth at home because they couldn't afford the $20 or so for the maternity clinic. Children are dropping out of school because parents can't pay the fees. Remote mining towns are virtually cut off from the outside world because the planes that once provisioned them no longer land. Most worrying, a crop disease periodically decimates the region's staple, cassava. Villagers who relied on their mining income to buy food when harvests failed are beginning to go hungry.
Meanwhile, the law is benefiting some of the very people it was meant to single out. The chief beneficiary is Gen. Bosco Ntaganda, who is nicknamed The Terminator and is sought by the International Criminal Court. Ostensibly a member of the Congolese Army, he is in fact a freelance killer with his own ethnic Tutsi militia, which provides ''security'' to traders smuggling minerals across the border to neighboring Rwanda.
All this might be a price worth paying if the law were having its intended effect of economically asphyxiating the warlords who turned eastern Congo into the deadliest conflict zone since World War II. As Representative Barney Frank, the Massachusetts Democrat for whom the act is partly named, memorably put it, ''The purpose is to cut off funding to people who kill people.''
But by the time President Obama signed the law last summer, the conflict had moved into a different phase. Most of the militias that wreaked havoc between 2003 and 2008 have since been incorporated into the Congolese Army. The two or three of any significance that remain get their money from kidnapping and extortion, not from controlling mining sites or transport routes. The law has not stopped their depredations.
The people of eastern Congo agree that it would be beneficial to bring greater clarity and transparency to the mineral trade. A variety of local and international initiatives to do so were under way when the embargo hit. Those efforts may now become a casualty of the Dodd-Frank law.
The Chinese have recently opened a trading post in North Kivu; they make cellphones as well, and don't feel the need to participate in transparency schemes the way Western companies do. And because they know they're the only market in town, they are buying at a steep discount.
Rarely do local miners, high-level traders, mining companies and civil society leaders agree on an issue. But in eastern Congo, they were unanimous in condemning Dodd-Frank. The Rev. Didier de Failly, a Belgian priest who has lived in Congo for 45 years, insistently warned Western advocacy groups of the dangers posed by their campaign. He told them it was no defense for them to claim that they weren't proposing an embargo, since what they were doing would inevitably lead to one.
But once the advocacy groups succeeded in framing the debate as a contest between themselves and greedy corporate interests, no one bothered to solicit the opinion of local Congolese. As the leader of a civil-society group, Eric Kajemba, asked me, more in confusion than in anger, ''If the advocacy groups aren't speaking for the people of eastern Congo, whom are they speaking for?''

HEADLINE: Waiting For A Landslide

BYLINE: By ROSS DOUTHAT

 BODY:
In 1955, a political scientist named V. O. Key published an essay entitled ''A Theory of Critical Elections.'' He argued that realignments in American politics are usually punctuated by transformative elections, in which the old order suddenly gives way and a new majority emerges in its place.
This ''realignment theory'' was embraced by many scholars because it fit the historical record so well. Every 30 to 40 years, it seemed, the American political order had decisively turned over: in 1800, when Thomas Jefferson's Democratic-Republicans trounced John Adams's Federalists; in 1828, when the Democratic-Republicans split into the Democrats and the Whigs; and then on down through Abraham Lincoln's 1860 victory, William McKinley's 1896 consolidation of a Republican majority, and the emergence of Franklin Roosevelt's New Deal coalition. 
But what made sense to the political scientists of the past has become a trap for the politicians of the present. One reason American policy-making has become ''less stable, less effective, and less predictable'' -- in the words of the downgrade that Standard & Poor's handed to the United States on Friday night -- is the enduring influence of V. O. Key's theory, and the seductive dream of realignment that it conjured up.
This dream has hovered over national leaders from Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan to Bill Clinton and Newt Gingrich. But it has loomed larger in the last decade, as our politics have grown more polarized and our country has suffered through a series of dislocations and disasters. Events like 9/11 and the Great Recession have persuaded partisans on both sides that a dramatic realignment is imminent; the breadth of the ideological divide has convinced them that it's necessary.
Thus the conservative hope that the war on terror would decisively tilt American politics to the right, and the liberal assumption that the 2008 financial crisis had unmade the Reagan coalition forever. Thus Karl Rove's famous goal of a permanent (or at least ''durable'') Republican majority and Rahm Emanuel's promise that the Obama White House wouldn't let a ''crisis go to waste.'' Thus the assumption, on the left and right alike, that every presidential election is the most important in our lifetime -- except for the next one, which will be more important still.
Like most commentators, I've indulged in these kinds of sentiments myself. American politics really is riven by fundamental divisions. Our recent elections have had dramatic consequences. It will make a tremendous difference whether the next enduring majority owes more to Barack Obama's liberalism, Tea Party conservatism, or some other worldview still.
But there's no guarantee that such a majority will be established in time to walk the country backward from the fiscal cliff. And in the meantime, our leaders have a responsibility that transcends their ideological differences: the responsibility to work with one another to keep the country solvent.
The dream of realignment has become the enemy of such compromises. It inspires politicians to claim sweeping mandates from highly contingent victories: think of Dick Cheney insisting on another round of deficit-financed tax cuts in 2003 because ''we won the midterm elections'' and ''this is our due,'' or the near-identical rebukes that President Obama delivered to Eric Cantor (''Elections have consequences -- and Eric, I won'') and to John McCain (''the election's over'') during the debates over the stimulus and health care.
The losers, meanwhile, wax intransigent, while hoping for a realignment of their own. After all, why cut a deal today if tomorrow you might overthrow your rivals permanently? Better to just say ''no'' flat out, as the Bush-era Democrats did with Social Security reform and the Republicans did with health care, and hope that the next election will deliver you the once-in-a-generation victory.
This is how some Republicans are thinking today, as they crow about ''the Obama downgrade'' and imagine all they can accomplish in a Mitt Romney administration. Or a Paul Ryan administration, for that matter: Many conservatives are eager to see their party's leading champion of entitlement reform enter the race, the better to make 2012 feel like a true hinge-of-history moment, a decisive choice between social democracy and free-market capitalism.
In reality, the next election may be no more transformative than 2008 turned out to be. The next Republican president may find himself as hemmed in and frustrated as President Obama has become. Meanwhile, America will still have a credit rating to fix, and a deficit to close.
None of this means that our parties need to give up their deep convictions, their grand plans, or their hopes of winning an enduring mandate.
But in the wake of the weekend's downgrade, we need them to govern as though that final victory might never quite arrive.

HEADLINE: A.I.G. to Sue Bank on Loss In Fiscal Crisis

BYLINE: By LOUISE STORY and GRETCHEN MORGENSON

 BODY:
The American International Group is planning to sue Bank of America over hundreds of mortgage-backed securities, adding to the surge of investors seeking compensation for the troubled mortgages that led to the financial crisis.
The suit seeks to recover more than $10 billion in losses on $28 billion of investments, in possibly the largest mortgage-security-related action filed by a single investor.
It claims that Bank of America and its Merrill Lynch and Countrywide Financial units misrepresented the quality of the mortgages placed in securities and sold to investors, according to three people with knowledge of the complaint.
A.I.G., still largely taxpayer-owned as a result of its 2008 government bailout, is among a growing group of investors pursuing private lawsuits because they believe banks misled them into buying risky securities during the housing boom. At least 90 suits related to mortgage bonds have been filed, demanding at least $197 billion, according to McCarthy Lawyer Links, a legal consulting firm. A.I.G. is preparing similar suits against other large financial institutions including Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase and Deutsche Bank, said the people with knowledge of the complaint, as part of a litigation strategy aimed at recovering some of the billions in losses the insurer sustained during the financial crisis. 
The private actions stand in stark contrast to the few credit crisis cases brought by the Justice Department, which is wrapping up many of its inquiries into big banks without filing any charges. The lack of prosecutions -- the Justice Department has brought three cases against employees at large financial companies and none against executives at large banks -- has left private litigants, mainly investors and consumers, standing more or less alone in trying to hold financial parties accountable.
''When federal authorities don't fulfill their obligation to enforce the law, they essentially give an imprimatur to the financial entities to do whatever they want and disregard the law,'' said Kathleen C. Engel, a professor at Suffolk University Law School in Boston. ''To the extent there are places where shareholders and borrowers can pursue claims, they are really serving the function of the government. They are our private attorneys general.''
Though many in the public have called for more accountability for parties involved in the financial crisis, criminal charges on complex financial matters can be difficult to prosecute.
A spokeswoman for the Justice Department said the government was vigorously pursuing cases where appropriate, and she pointed to a recent jail sentence for the chairman of the mortgage company Taylor, Bean & Whitaker. The spokeswoman, Alisa Finelli, declined to say how many people the government had assigned to that task.
''Prosecutors and agents determine on a case by case basis the importance of relevant evidence developed in private litigation and how such evidence should be pursued,'' Ms. Finelli said. ''Civil litigation involves a lower standard of proof than is required for a criminal prosecution, where prosecutors must have sufficient evidence to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that a crime has been committed.''
On Friday, the department announced it had concluded its investigation into Washington Mutual, the Seattle-based bank that nearly collapsed because of its risky mortgages, without finding evidence of criminal wrongdoing. The Justice Department has also concluded its investigation into Countrywide's conduct leading into the financial crisis, according to a person with knowledge of that case.
Even more investigations may soon be shut down because the Justice Department is heavily involved in negotiations between big banks and state attorneys general that may give the banks broad immunity against future claims. The state attorneys general are weighing these requests in the mortgage servicing and foreclosure cases, even though the government has not pursued the most basic investigation of these practices.
As it has in similar cases, Bank of America is likely to dispute A.I.G.'s claims, in the suit, which is expected to be filed on Monday in New York State Supreme Court. When asked generally about the quality of mortgage bonds issued by companies that are now part of the bank, Lawrence Di Rita, a spokesman for Bank of America, said the disclosures were robust enough for sophisticated investors. He said many of the loans lost value because housing fell.
''Now you have a lot of investors and lawyers who are seeking to recoup the losses from an economic downturn,'' Mr. Di Rita said. The bank has not yet seen A.I.G.'s suit.
A.I.G. also plans to file a request to intervene in the $8.5 billion settlement proposed in June by Bank of America and Bank of New York Mellon, which represents mortgage security investors including BlackRock and Pimco. Mr. Di Rita said on Sunday that large sophisticated investors have signed on to that deal.
A.I.G. plans to object to the deal because it believes the amount is too low and that Bank of New York's role was rife with conflicts, according to the people with knowledge of A.I.G.'s plans.
A spokesman for A.I.G. declined to comment. but the company's chief executive, Robert H. Benmosche, told shareholders in 2010 that he was considering litigation to recover losses.
Cases like A.I.G.'s may turn up information in interviews and document discovery that could be helpful to the government, though it is unclear if the Justice Department would seek to reopen closed cases.
Already, the private suits are revealing dubious activities. One case against Bear Stearns indicates that its employees put troubled mortgages into securitization trusts that it sold to customers, while simultaneously receiving reimbursement -- known as apology payments -- from the companies that originated the loans.
And a recent case against Morgan Stanley cited a witness saying that the bank would receive mortgages with documentation of a buyer's income and then shred that documentation so that it could call it a ''no doc'' loan and pay less for it. Those banks dispute the accusations.
Lawsuits have long been a crucial method for shareholders to recover losses. A February letter to the Securities and Exchange Commission from the general counsel of the California Public Employees' Retirement System noted that private litigants in the 100 largest securities class action settlements had recovered $46.7 billion for defrauded shareholders.
But the costs of these recoveries are often borne by the companies' insurers or stockholders. It is exceedingly rare that such deals require money to come from the pockets of corporate executives or directors. As a result, the lack of criminal inquiries by the government means that restitution is often paid by innocent parties -- shareholders -- who have already been hurt by the questionable conduct.
Lawyers involved in the lawsuits, who stand to share in any financial recoveries, say that there are plenty of unknown facts related to the crisis that should be exposed.
''We continue to discover new information,'' said Gerald H. Silk, a lawyer with Bernstein Litowitz Berger & Grossmann. ''The private litigations that have been brought on behalf of investors paint a very strong picture that many of the financial calamities were caused by fraud.''
Mr. Silk's firm has filed dozens of cases related to the financial crisis, and the government has contacted the firm with requests for information in a few of them, Mr. Silk said.
The government could look to private litigation and the law firms bringing the actions for potential witnesses and new information. A recent case against Wachovia, for instance, included 51 confidential witnesses. Lawyers say, however, that many witnesses in private litigation cases have not been contacted by the government.
A.I.G. faced some limits on the lawsuits it could bring, because during the bailout the company signed a waiver that it would not sue big banks over mortgage bonds it had insured. But it did not sign such a deal on a series of Goldman Sachs securities called Abacus, nor for mortgage bonds it bought outright, like the $28 billion worth of securities included in its suit against Bank of America. The company is working with the law firm Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan, which is bringing many financial crisis cases.
According to the people with knowledge of the litigation, the roughly 200-page complaint relies on more than 1,900 pages of exhibits. Quinn Emanuel interviewed former Bank of America employees and conducted forensic analysis on more than 262,000 loans inside 349 deals. They found that 4 out of 10 mortgages, on average, differed significantly from the descriptions of the loans in the marketing materials.
For instance, the number of loans said to cover owner-occupied properties was lower than investors were told, and the amount of the loans compared with the value of properties was often higher.
The complaint describes the loan files of one mortgage security, where 82 percent of the loans did not comply with the underwriting guidelines as marketed to investors.
For instance, a borrower in that deal who said she was a builder with 25 years of experience was born in 1971. Another borrower inflated his income by about $90,000 on his application, though his tax return in the loan file showed the true figure.
The suit against Bank of America involves mortgage bonds that A.I.G.'s securities lending unit bought using savings from its insurance subsidiaries, which relied to some degree on the high ratings on the mortgage bonds.
A.I.G. will contend that Countrywide, Merrill Lynch and Bank of America provided false information to the ratings agencies, resulting in false ratings. And the insurer will describe the steps it took to understand the mortgages that were placed in the deals, like requesting spreadsheets with data about all the loans in the deals from the banks that created them.

HEADLINE: After Tumultuous Week, Markets Prepare for Another: Across Globe, Traders Brace For a Downturn

BYLINE: By NELSON D. SCHWARTZ; Bettina Wassener contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Traders and bankers are braced for another volatile week in global markets -- and the wildest ride is likely to be in stocks, not the Treasury bonds that were downgraded by Standard & Poor's on Friday.
The initial shock waves from the downgrade of the government's credit rating were felt in stock markets over the weekend. Shares plunged in the Middle East on Sunday and had slipped by midday in Asia.
On Wall Street, traders and strategists trekked to their offices on Sunday in scenes reminiscent of the fateful weekend before Lehman Brothers collapsed in 2008. Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Barclays, Credit Suisse and Morgan Stanley all hosted conference calls for anxious investors, and traders plotted strategy for what they expected to be a tumultuous day on Monday. 
In Israel, shares fell 7 percent on Sunday, the worst drop since 2000. Investors placed so many sell orders that the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange delayed the opening of trading.
By midday on Monday, Japanese stocks were down almost 2 percent, and in Hong Kong they had fallen nearly 4 percent. Gold prices were soaring, with spot prices approaching $1,700 an ounce, and the dollar weakened in early trading. In futures trading on Sunday night, major United States stock indexes were down more than 2 percent, although futures are not always reliable indicators of how stocks will open the next day in New York.
One factor that might bolster stocks is the announcement by European leaders on Sunday that they were planning huge purchases of Italian and Spanish bonds in an attempt to reassure nervous investors.
S.& P. -- the rating agency that issued a historic downgrade of United States Treasury securities to AA+ from AAA on Friday night -- is expected this week to downgrade a host of other securities linked to Treasuries. Those include bonds from insurers as well as debt from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the government-controlled mortgage giants.
Like Treasuries, notes issued by Fannie and Freddie are considered to be among the safest investments, so even a modest downgrade could rattle investors.
''What they did on Friday is a big deal,'' said Peter Fisher, the head of fixed-income portfolio management at BlackRock, the giant asset manager. ''We're all waiting to see how they follow through in terms of the knock-on effect.''
At the Newport Beach, Calif., headquarters of Pimco, the world's largest bond fund manager, the co-chief investment officer, William H. Gross, met with senior money managers and traders as Asian markets prepared to open, and also gathered a skeleton crew of employees to staff the trading desks.
It was the first Sunday that he had gathered his team at the office since Lehman's collapse in September 2008, Mr. Gross said, adding that he was planning to be back at work at 3:30 Pacific time on Monday morning to gauge the market action in Europe.
''It's a series of events that comes close to Lehman in terms of the anticipation, and the sleeplessness is similar,'' Mr. Gross said. While he said he did not expect stocks or bonds to necessarily plunge this time, volatility reminiscent of the days of the financial crisis might be in store.
Mr. Gross said he expected that investors in only about 1 percent of his firm's accounts would sell Treasury securities.
At the Manhattan offices of BlackRock, which has $3.6 trillion under management, Mr. Fisher was also at his desk Sunday. He said he did not expect that investors would automatically sell Treasury bonds as a result of the downgrade, but that they might unload riskier assets like stocks and lower-rated bonds.
''If you think the world is a risky place, you start at the outer edges, not what's least risky,'' Mr. Fisher said.
On both sides of the Atlantic, the twin worries of staggering amounts of government debt and slowing economic growth dominated the broader discussion, prompting European leaders to announce the purchases of Italian and Spanish bonds.
For American investors, the downgrade by S.& P. comes at an especially jittery moment.
By the time the rating agency acted late Friday, Wall Street had suffered its worst week since the financial crisis, with the Dow Jones industrial average falling 5.75 percent, a slide punctuated by a 512-point drop on Thursday.
Even more than the standoff over raising the federal debt ceiling, the stock market's plunge was caused by increasing fears that the economy has lost its momentum and could even be on the verge of another recession.
Those worries, compounded by the downgrade, could add up to a one-two punch for stocks.
''Investors who are still on the fence may begin to think a recession is more likely,'' said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at S.& P. Equity Research, which operates independently of S.& P.'s ratings division. ''There are a lot of things investors now have to contend with. They have to decide whether the global economy has stepped on a soft patch or on quicksand.''
To be sure, not everyone on Wall Street was calling for doom and gloom. In a note on Sunday, Barry Knapp, a strategist at Barclays Capital, said his firm remained bullish. Stock valuations, he insisted, remain appealing.
Still, in a sign of the anxiety coursing through Wall Street all weekend, nearly 4,000 investors dialed into a conference call organized by Morgan Stanley's research team. ''That's the most I've ever heard of for a Sunday in August,'' said Adam Parker, the firm's chief United States equity strategist.
Echoing Mr. Fisher's statements, Mr. Parker said that the Morgan Stanley team did not expect Treasuries to take a hit as a result of the downgrade.
But, as fear rises, riskier assets like stocks are likely to suffer, he said. He is recommending that investors avoid the consumer discretionary sector, which means companies like restaurants, retailers and apparel sellers, as well as industrial companies. A safer harbor might be health care companies and utilities.
''With the market having come down this fast, that in and of itself could increase the probability of a recession,'' Mr. Parker said.

HEADLINE: Titans Grappling With Governance

BYLINE: By JEFFREY GOLDFARB and RICHARD BEALES

 BODY:
Sumner Redstone should enjoy watching Rupert Murdoch squirm. There's no love lost between Mr. Redstone, the 88-year-old chairman of Viacom and CBS, and Mr. Murdoch, the head of the News Corporation. Last year, Mr. Redstone even presciently ridiculed his competitor's fondness for newspapers. But as Mr. Murdoch grapples with the misdeeds of one of his British tabloids, Mr. Redstone can delight only so much. He has his own costly governance problems, too.
Mr. Redstone and his deputies have overcome some of them. Under Les Moonves, CBS has been riding an advertising rebound and capitalizing on digital opportunities with Amazon and Netflix. MTV's unexpected cultural phenomenon ''Jersey Shore'' and Paramount's Oscar-winning movie ''The Fighter'' have helped propel Viacom, which reported better-than-expected earnings last week. So did the decisions last year by Philippe Dauman, its chief executive, to pay a dividend and buy back stock. 
As a result, shares of CBS and Viacom have outperformed rivals over the last year. Even over a five-year span, roughly since Mr. Redstone separated the older broadcast TV business from the supposedly hipper cable network operations, Viacom's total shareholder return of around 40 percent matches Disney's and beats Time Warner's. News Corporation has lost shareholders around 10 percent in value since mid-2006.
Yet Mr. Redstone's empire has plenty in common with Mr. Murdoch's. There are dual-class share structures with unequal voting rights giving them control; unspecified succession plans; children on the boards who've squabbled with Dad; and an F grade from the Corporate Library, a governance watchdog. While the News Corporation's board is packed with Mr. Murdoch's cronies, the average age of nonexecutive directors at Mr. Redstone's companies makes them old enough to have watched Ed Sullivan's 1948 debut.
Despite operational improvements, the market hasn't overlooked these flaws. According to Barclays Capital forecasts for 2012, CBS currently trades at around a 20 percent discount to the sum of its parts, and Viacom trades at nearly 30 percent less than it is worth. As the News Corporation's shareholders are discovering, governance can make a difference. It's a lesson Mr. Redstone's people shouldn't overlook.
Release the Raters
It's a love-hate relationship. The White House doesn't like Standard & Poor's downgrading of America's debt -- it even picked holes in the firm's numbers. European officials don't welcome critiques of sovereign credit either. Yet governments seem broadly inclined to regulate credit rating firms tightly. The better answer is to cut them loose.
Without official recognition, S.& P., Moody's Investors Service and Fitch Ratings would eventually become just competitors with other credit researchers. Investors would have to decide whose analysis was most credible. They could ignore S.& P. if they choose, or discount all three firms' views because of their many failures to see early warning signs ahead of the 2008 crisis and look elsewhere for insight.
Last year's Dodd-Frank act started a process of de-deifying the troika, requiring the Securities and Exchange Commission to find alternatives to the use of credit ratings in regulations.
At the same time, Dodd-Frank also requires the S.E.C. to intensify its oversight of officially recognized rating firms. More pervasively, global Basel III rules on bank capital still have ratings baked in. It's not easy to find a straightforward alternative, but it shouldn't be beyond the imagination of bankers and watchdogs. Traditional ratings carry far too much weight, given their narrow primary purpose as indicators of default probability. A multifaceted approach would bring better risk management. The trouble is, even investors who perform their own credit analysis often like ratings because they provide a framework for arbitrage.
Perhaps the White House's spat with S.& P. will clarify minds. Governments don't need to hold these particular enemies close or worry about their mistakes; they should just release them to fight for influence on their merits.

HEADLINE: Voters Want a Change Politicians Can't Deliver

BYLINE: By JOHN HARWOOD

 BODY:
WASHINGTON - Here is the bad news forPresident Obama and incumbents in both parties: it can get worse - and stay that way for a long time.
That might sound like catastrophic thinking after Mr. Obama's nerve-jangling birthday week, during which he got several gag gifts: a near default, a 500-point market drop and the first-ever downgrade of United States debt by a major credit ratings agency.
But step back from events this month, this year or even this decade, and a more ominous portrait comes into focus. 
It shows an American economy under ever-increasing competitive pressure, demographic trends making those pressures more acute and a voting public facing repeated disappointment as it yearns for better times.
That disappointment may represent the long-term political consequence of a financial crisis and recession that has forced the nation to finally come to terms with its economic vulnerability.
For a generation, ''our economy has been, for the majority of people, a slow-growth economy,'' said Robert D. Reischauer, who was the director of the Congressional Budget Office in the early 1990s. ''But our standards of living have improved much more, due to some factors that can't and won't be repeated.''
Republicans felt the voters' wrath in 2008, as Democrats did last year. There is no sign of a Morning in America in 2012, or anytime soon.
''We're going to see turbulence'' in more elections, Mr. Reischauer concluded. ''It's a very grim picture.''
Then and Now
Any American economy would suffer compared with the one that emerged as a dominant force after World War II. In 1960, according to the World Bank, the United States accounted for 39 percent of global economic output.
Millions of soldiers came home to attend college under the G.I. Bill, lifting worker productivity and expanding the suburban middle class. Annual economic growth topped 5 percent four times each in the 1950s, '60s and '70s.
Those trend lines eventually turned down. But changes in American society helped mask the effects.
While international competition shrank the American share of the global economy, women poured into the work force and gave more and more families two breadwinners instead of one.
While men's median income declined slightly between 1970 and 1990, the median income for women rose nearly 50 percent. So household income rose.
While overall growth slowed - the economy expanded at least 5 percent in a year just once in the 1980s, and not since - so did the rate at which Americans had children. Smaller families stretched family incomes further.
And as increases in education and the number of women in the work force reached a plateau, cheap and easy credit encouraged Americans to consume more. So did the ''wealth effect'' from the Internet-fueled stock market of the 1990s, and the real estate boom after that.
From 1980 to 2005, personal savings as a proportion of disposable income shrank to 1.5 percent from 9.8 percent. All the while, politicians and voters grew accustomed to more government services than they were willing to pay for.
''The 2007-2009 collapse brought this era to an end,'' Mr. Reischauer said. In the new one, ordinary Americans ''are going to be very frustrated, because the political system can't deliver the rising economic performance and living standards they've come to expect.''
Electoral Turmoil
That does not mean that Mr. Obama will lose his bid for re-election, though his approval rating in a New York Times/CBS News Poll last week remained 2 percentage points below the 50 percent mark.
Nor does it mean that Republicans will lose their House majority, even though the same survey showed a record 82 percent voter disapproval of Congress.
Given the advantages of incumbency, even sluggish growth and a glacial decline in the 9.1 percent unemployment rate could preserve the current divided government.
''Americans traditionally are much more interested in the direction the economy's going than in the absolute level,'' said Mark Mellman, a Democratic pollster. ''The absolute level can be not so good, unemployment can be relatively high, and incumbents can still get re-elected as long as things are moving in the right direction.''
But it does suggest that after ''change'' elections in 2006, 2008 and 2010, stability is no longer the presumption.
Thus, most incumbents enter each contest on the defensive - from intraparty rebels in primaries if not from the other party in general elections. The opening for a third-party insurgency has grown wider should an independent candidate emerge with the right profile and financial backing.
''It's a problem for everybody in office,'' said Tom Davis, a former chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee who describes himself as happily retired from the House.
''The political system, Republican or Democrat, over the last decade has delivered two failed wars, an economic meltdown, 20 percent of homes underwater, stagnant wages,'' he said. ''Voters look at the political system as a whole as just not giving them anything.''
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Geithner Will Stay for Now, the Treasury Department Says

BYLINE: By CHARLIE SAVAGE

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The Treasury secretary, Timothy F. Geithner, has told President Obama that he will remain in his position for the time being, the department announced on Sunday, ending speculation that he might step down soon. 
''Secretary Geithner has let the president know that he plans to stay on in his position at Treasury,'' Jenni R. LeCompte, a Treasury spokeswoman, said in a written statement. ''He looks forward to the important work ahead on the challenges facing our great country.''
Mr. Geithner, 49, said a month ago that he would decide on his future after the administration and Congress reached a deal to increase the nation's debt limit, raising the possibility that he would step down. Mr. Obama signed the debt ceiling legislation into law last Tuesday.
But the White House pressed Mr. Geithner to stay, citing a need for stability in Mr. Obama's economic team and a desire to avoid another confrontation with Senate Republicans, who have used the filibuster to delay or prevent votes on many of Mr. Obama's nominees to important executive branch positions.
By late last week, administration officials were saying privately that it appeared Mr. Geithner would stay through the end of Mr. Obama's term, although he had not yet told the White House his final decision, pending conversations with his family.
Jay Carney, the White House spokesman, said in a statement on Sunday, ''The president asked Secretary Geithner to stay on at Treasury and welcomes his decision.''

HEADLINE: S.&P. Downgrade Is Seen as Adding Urgency to Debt-Cutting Panel

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The downgrade of the United States government's credit rating by Standard & Poor's is almost sure to increase pressure on a new Congressional ''supercommittee'' to mute ideological disagreements and recommend a package of deficit-reduction measures far exceeding its original goal of at least $1.5 trillion, lawmakers said Sunday.
Even before the panel is appointed, its mission is expanding. Its role is not just to cut the annual budget deficit and slow the explosive growth of federal debt but also to appease the markets and help restore the United States' top credit rating of AAA. Otherwise, taxpayers may eventually have to pay more in interest for every dollar borrowed by the Treasury. 
The report certainly got the attention of Capitol Hill. ''I think this is one of the most telling, important moments in our country's history right now,'' Senator John Kerry, Democrat of Massachusetts, said Sunday on the NBC program ''Meet the Press.'' He added: ''This poses a set of choices not just about a recession. It's about a financial crisis and the structure of our economy, which really has been misallocating capital.''
In the S.&P. report on Friday outlining the reasons for removing long-term Treasury debt from its list of nearly risk-free investments, the company cited doubts about the ability of the two political parties to bridge their gulf on fiscal policy.
Credit rating agencies have thus emerged as a powerful constituency whose concerns are taken seriously by Congress.
Representative Joe Courtney, Democrat of Connecticut, said he had ''read and reread the S. & P. report'' several times since it was issued Friday night, and he said it could spur action by Congress. If the 12 members of the committee, to be appointed by Aug. 16 by Congressional leaders of the two parties, could agree on a deficit-reduction package, and if Congress approved it, Mr. Courtney said, ''that would surprise a lot of skeptics'' and could disprove the company's criticism of the United States political system.
Representative Blake Farenthold, a freshman Republican from Texas, said the S.&P. report could have a beneficial effect. ''Anything that encourages the new committee to get the job done and get us back on a rational fiscal path is a good thing,'' Mr. Farenthold said.
Another freshman Republican, Representative Steve Southerland II of Florida, said the credit report created ''a sense of urgency for the two parties to come together.'' The possibility of a further downgrade ''scares me,'' Mr. Southerland said.
The stated goal of the new panel, the Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction, is to cut federal budget deficits by a total of ''at least $1.5 trillion'' over the next decade.
The first round of savings under the new law, coming from annual caps on appropriations, is estimated at $917 billion over 10 years. Standard & Poor's had said it was hoping to see $4 trillion in total deficit reduction. If the joint committee wanted to reach that goal, it might seek a bigger, more comprehensive deal, aiming to save $3 trillion rather than $1.5 trillion over 10 years.
If Congress wants to satisfy the rating agencies -- Moody's and Fitch have so far kept their AAA ratings of government debt -- it will need to lock in substantial deficit-reduction measures, without using the kind of budgetary gimmicks that sometimes appear to produce savings under accounting rules prescribed by Congress, several lawmakers said.
Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, said Sunday on ''Meet the Press'' that the credit downgrade created an ''added incentive'' for the new committee and Congress as a whole to agree on major deficit-reduction plans.
On the other hand, opposition to proposals from the committee, due by Nov. 23, could increase with the size of the package. And a bigger joint committee bill might make the alternative -- automatic across-the-board cuts saving $1.2 trillion over 10 years -- appear more attractive, lawmakers said.
Democrats like the Senate majority leader, Harry Reid of Nevada, cited the downgrade as another reason to include revenue-raising measures in a package. Republicans like Speaker John A. Boehner of Ohio said the downgrade strengthened the case for deeper cuts in spending.
Before their talks broke down last month, President Obama and Mr. Boehner were pursuing a ''grand bargain'' that sought savings of $4 trillion over a decade.
Senator Kerry also endorsed that goal. The United States must show the markets that it is ''deadly serious about dealing with its long-term structural debt,'' he said, and the way to do that is by ''putting a plan on the table, $4 trillion plus, if necessary.''
Republicans have historically seen the deficit as an issue that plays to their political advantage. Deficit-reduction proposals floated by Mr. Obama as part of a grand bargain set him against many of his liberal supporters.
Congressional Democrats, lobbyists for older Americans and advocates for the poor expressed alarm last month when Mr. Obama showed serious interest in proposals to reduce the cost-of-living adjustment for Social Security benefits, increase the eligibility age for Medicare and cut Medicaid payments to the states for treating poor people.
The new panel will have 14 weeks to do its work. Republicans have made clear that they will push for cuts in federal spending under the new health care law, arguing that it should be on the table along with other government programs and tax breaks. The Congressional Budget Office says the law will cover 34 million uninsured people by expanding Medicaid and subsidizing private insurance at a cost of $1.1 trillion over 10 years.
On ''Fox News Sunday,'' Representative Paul D. Ryan, Republican of Wisconsin and chairman of the House Budget Committee, said the new panel would probably not ''achieve a full fix to our problems because Democrats have never wanted to put their health care bill on the table.''
S.&P. did not advocate a specific mix of increased revenue and spending cuts. But it did say that overhauling entitlement programs was ''key to long-term fiscal sustainability'' and that the debt deal ''envisions only minor policy changes on Medicare.''

HEADLINE: Better Than Expected?

BYLINE: FLOYD NORRIS


HIGHLIGHT: When down 200 looks positive.

 BODY:
A funny thing happened when the American stock market opened this morning.
European stocks showed signs of recovery.
Presumably the plunge in prices in this country were not as bad as some feared. The Dow may have lost 200 points within minutes, but Europe was encouraged.
You know pessimism has grown intense when there is relief at the Dow falling 200 points.
But in the past few minutes, those gains in Europe have been erased, as American stock prices move to new daily lows. If 200 was not bad enough, how about more than 300?
As this is written about 10:45 a.m., every market seems to be at new daily lows.

HEADLINE: Moody's: Why the U.S. Is Still AAA

BYLINE: FLOYD NORRIS


HIGHLIGHT: Moody's reaffirms its Triple A rating of the United States.

 BODY:
Virtually unnoticed last week was that Moody's kept a Triple A rating on the United States.
On Monday, the credit rating agency released its "Weekly Credit Outlook" publication discussing the decision. Whether by coincidence or not, the stock market turned up just after 11 a.m., just as the wires carried headlines from that. (Why it is news that Moody's has not changed its mind in the past week is for someone else to explain.)
The United States, Moody's says, has "unmatched access to financing, meaning that the U.S. government can support higher debt levels than other governments."
Somebody tell Washington. Greece has a debt crisis. The United States had a debt limit crisis. It can, if it wishes, do something to try to avert a new plunge into global recession, which has become a real fear.
Here's an excerpt:
Characteristics that support the Aaa rating and that formed the basis of our decision to confirm the rating include the following:1. The unparalleled diversity and size of the U.S. economy and its long record of relatively solid economic growth, based on both demographics and productivity. Even if the short-term economic outlook exhibits some weakness, we believe that the long term remains favorable in relation to many other advanced economies. This provides a solid base for government finance.2. The global role of the dollar, which underpins continued demand for U.S. dollar assets, including U.S. Treasury obligations. This feature, unique to the U.S., provides unmatched access to financing, meaning that the U.S. government can support higher debt levels than other governments. Thus, while comparisons of government debt ratios form an important part of our rating analysis, the status of the dollar and the U.S. government debt market need to be taken into account when making such comparisons. Over time, the dollar's role may be eroded, but we see no immediate threat.3. Relative to other large Aaa-rated governments, the U.S. debt position is somewhat high, but not out of line with the positions of these countries. While the projected trend of U.S. government debt is less favorable without further deficit reduction measures, we believe that eventually such measures will be adopted. The less favorable debt ratio trend now in place is reflected in the negative outlook assigned to the rating.4. A step in the right direction toward deficit reduction was taken on 2 August with the passage of the Budget Control Act, even if by itself it will not produce all of the deficit reduction measures necessary to reverse the debt trajectory. Although the political process has been considerably more contentious than usual in the past few months, it finally did produce an agreement. We expect further fiscal measures over time, albeit with vigorous debate over the particulars.

HEADLINE: A Visual Chronicle of Stock Traders' Agony

BYLINE: PETER LATTMAN


HIGHLIGHT: The stock market's latest swoon has good material for a Web site on the anguish of those on the trading floor, but for its creator, the humor has worn off.

 BODY:
The tumult in the stock market has been a boon for The Brokers With Hands on Their Faces Blog.
With traders around the world gesticulating in agony as the financial indexes swoon, a Web site is documenting the suffering.
 The Brokers With Hands on Their Faces Blog is exactly what it sounds like and nothing more: a blog that posts photographs of market players putting their hands on their faces.
"I guess that in a morbid way the site has suddenly come back into fashion," said Matthew R. Robison, the blog's creator. On Friday, the day after the market dropped 500 points, Mr. Robison said the blog's traffic reached a record of nearly 50,000 visitors.
Mr. Robison, 28, started the site in October 2008 during the depths of the financial crisis. Back then he was living in Brooklyn and working as a production assistant at Palgrave Macmillan, the academic publisher. Pictures of pained traders were popping up everywhere, and Mr. Robison thought they were funny.
He put together a collage of about 10 of them and sent it around the office. His friends laughed. He posted them on a site he created on Tumblr, a blogging platform with a visual focus. It went viral.
"I was cavalier about the financial crisis back then because I had so little money," he said. "In the beginning it was pure schadenfreude, because for middle-class people like me it's kind of funny to laugh at stock brokers."
Mr. Robison's blog is one of a group of Web sites that over the last decade has taken pleasure in Wall Street's misfortunes. During the housing crisis, the Mortgage Lender Implode-O-Meter gained a large following by tracking the lenders that had run into trouble. And in the dot-com bust, a Web site with an obscene name became popular as it catalogued technology companies as they collapsed.
Mr. Robison has taken a more visual approach. Through the spring of 2009, he had published about 100 different images. His blog contains no words, only pictures. One guy rubs his eyes in disbelief. Another covers his mouth in surprise. Yet another scratches his head in confusion. (Sad Guys on Trading Floors, an unrelated site, has a similar format but includes captions and is not limited to traders and their hands.)
As the market began its postfinancial crisis rally in 2009 - and brokers presumably stopped putting their hands on their faces - the site went dormant. Mr. Robison also moved on in his personal life, leaving New York to follow his girlfriend to Madison, Wis. But last Thursday during the market downturn, Mr. Robison said he received a couple of dozen e-mails from readers all over the country. One reader, who Mr. Robison said worked for the Web site of a major news network, sent him several new photos of traders in anguish.
"So I started things up again, partly out of boredom, but I was also following the debt crisis and felt like I wanted to comment in some way," he said.
Mr. Robison says he thinks that people have responded to the site for a variety of reasons.
"With these photos there are a number of layers to laugh at - the poor broker, the photographer waiting to take that perfect photo of the poor broker, the media who love to run with these photos," he said. "And then there's me, this guy who collected them and made a blog, which is totally ridiculous as well. People can laugh at whichever part they want to laugh at or maybe they're not laughing at all. Maybe they think it's beautiful, or horrible, or stupid. All of them are probably right."
As for himself, Mr. Robison, who grew up in Lake Elsinore, Calif., said that as Wall Street's problems spilled over onto Main Street - and into his own life - he had stopped finding the humor in market declines.
A bank foreclosed on his parents' home last year. Budget cuts have gutted the public school where his mother teaches. And while Mr. Robison is freelancing for a number of publications, including the popular Web site The Morning News, he says he cannot find steady work in Madison.
"I don't think it's funny anymore," he said. "Now it's kind of sad because I just want the economy to recover."
But he said he would continue to publish photos of brokers with hands on their faces.
"I think I'll keep posting them until I get a job."

HEADLINE: In Brooklyn, a Happy Birthday to a Simple Pleasure

BYLINE: JAMES BARRON


HIGHLIGHT: Recalling the opening of a city pool decades ago during a time of economic distress.

 BODY:
Picture a Monday in August: A bad day on Wall Street. Spain in the headlines again. More hot, dry weather in this country. The mayor was complaining that New York was not getting the federal money it should.
It was a Monday 75 years ago, the day on which Mayor Fiorello H. La Guardia opened the city pool in Red Hook, Brooklyn, the 11th Depression-era pool built by the parks department with money from the federal Works Progress Administration.
That opening was celebrated on Monday by Adrian Benepe, the parks commissioner, and other officials, including the Brooklyn borough president, Marty Markowitz. The crowd was smaller this time around; at most a few hundred were on hand. In 1936, the turnout was 40,000. But as stopwatches clicked and relay races began, some on the sidelines reflected on the economic ups and downs of then and now.
"It's similar, dire, economic straits," said James Martin, an artist from Red Hook who swims at the pool five days a week. "It seems like it's out of our hands now - it's all special interests and lobbyists now, and we're doing well not to close down, not to cut. It's almost like our expectations have become so much lower."
Onorio Mercado, 54, a bus driver from the Bronx, said he was worried about the future, in part because the economy "might even get worse" before it got better, in part because the country seemed "more united" 75 years ago.
"When I retire," he said, "all the benefits people had years ago, I might not have. With all the problems with Wall Street, 401(k)s are going down. The problems are so wide. It's not just the city. But this country has been around a long time. We'll crawl out of it."
Hannah Borgeson of Manhattan sounded more upbeat. "I don't think we're in a great depression," she said, "but I agree when they say it's a great resource to have these pools. I feel like our government is putting less resources into programs than in the Depression."
Mr. Benepe said he was still optimistic, in part because the city was in "the biggest period of investment in parks and infrastructure" since the Depression.
"But we're investing city money," he said. "They" - the officials who built the pools and other parks projects in the 1930s - "also had federal money." 
Mr. Benepe said the pools were models of engineering and design. "They made them safe, and they made them clean," he said.
"You should see the filtration system," he added. "It looks like the Queen Mary." To young swimmers standing nearby, he said, "Anybody know what the Queen Mary is?"
Admission, now free, was 10 cents when the pool opened 75 years ago. Mayor La Guardia told youngsters at the opening that a dime "means a lot to your parents" but that they could swim in the morning, when children were not charged admission. 
After about an hour - there were speeches to give and listen to, and relay races to emcee - Mr. Benepe changed into a bathing suit.
He said he was no Robert Moses, referring to the parks commissioner who presided over the construction of the pools in the 1930s. Moses had been a swimmer in college and, Mr. Benepe said, often swam at events at city pools. 
Mr. Benepe described himself as a "mediocre" swimmer. 
A moment later, he said, "I'm an O.K. swimmer."
Then he said, "I could probably make it across."
But no, he said, he would not join the synchronized swimmers' demonstration.

HEADLINE: Why S.&P.'s Ratings Are Substandard and Porous

BYLINE: NATE SILVER


HIGHLIGHT: S.&#038;P.'s bond ratings from five years ago would have told you almost nothing about the risk of a default today.

 BODY:
Five years ago, if you were an investor looking for guidance on which country's debt was the safest to invest in, Standard & Poor's ratings wouldn't have done much to help you navigate the headwinds of the financial crisis.
Investors now think that Ireland has more than a 40 percent chance of a default or debt restructuring at some point in the next five years. The country is penalized with double-digit interest rates when it wants to borrow money. But in 2006, Standard & Poor's had Ireland's debt rated with its top-of-the-line, AAA rating. It didn't downgrade Ireland until March 30, 2009, long after its financial problems had become obvious, and the price to buy insurance on its debt had increased tenfold from a year earlier.
Spain, which markets now posit has about a three-in-ten chance of default or restructuring, also had a AAA rating, which it maintained until January 2009. Today it still has a AA rating, one notch higher than Japan's.
Iceland, the tiny country with the oversized banking sector that came perilously close to national bankruptcy, was in 2006 rated AA+, the same rating the United States now has. 
Greece, which now appears more likely than not to endure at least a technical default, had debt rated A, lower than most European countries but a reasonably good grade by world standards. It too was not downgraded until January 2009, and its bonds were still rated as investment-grade until March 2010.
Although Standard & Poor's assigns ratings based on a series of letter grades, they can easily be translated into a numerical scale -- sort of like the way that letter grades in high school are translated into a grade-point average:
This allows to test the reliability of the ratings in various ways, as well as to reverse-engineer them and see how the sausage is made.
What factors is S.&P. looking at when it rates sovereign debt? A country's debt-to-G.D.P. ratio? Its inflation rate? The size of its annual deficits?
S.&P. does look at each of these factors. But it also places very heavy emphasis on subjective views about a country's political environment. In fact, these political factors are at least as important as economic variables in determining their ratings.
For instance, the S.&P. ratings have an extremely strong relationship with a measure of political risk known as the Corruption Perceptions Index, which is published annually by Transparency International. These ratings have been the subject of much criticism because they are highly subjective, relying on a composite of surveys conducted among "experts" at international organizations who may have spent little time in most of the countries and who may instead base their judgments on cultural stereotypes. 
I don't know whether or not S.&P. looks at these ratings. But the fact that the two sets of ratings are so closely related is troublesome. It suggests that S.&P. is making a lot of judgment calls about countries they have no particular knowledge about. Keep in mind that even when it comes to the United States, S.&P. made a $2 trillion error that reflects their lack of understanding of the way that bills are scored by the Congressional Budget Office. Are we to expect that they add value based on their perceptions of the political climate in Kazakhstan, or Cyprus, or Uganda?
Other factors that S.&P. looks at, which can be determined through regression analysis, include a country's G.D.P., its inflation rate, its recent deficits and its long-term debt. But the subjective Corruption Perceptions Index is more closely related to the S.&P. ratings than any of these economic fundamentals. 
In addition, in 2006, S.&P. tended to rate European countries higher than others, even after controlling for all these other factors -- something which has been especially problematic since, with some exceptions like Venezuela and Lebanon, countries in the euro zone now dominate the list of those most likely to default. 
None of this would be a problem if S.&P.'s ratings had performed well. But there is little evidence that they do. The next chart presents a comparison of S.&P. ratings as of June 30, 2006, to the risk of default five years later (on June 30, 2011) as measured by the prices of credit default swaps, financial instruments that pay an investor if there is a default on a bond obligation. 
S.&P.'s bond ratings from five years ago would have told you almost nothing about the risk of a default today. They had no insight about the threats in European markets, nor about which countries in Europe were relatively more likely to default. (Norway, which remains among the most solvent countries in the world, had a AAA rating in 2006, but so did Ireland and Spain.)
By comparison, simply looking at a country's ratio of net debt to G.D.P. would have been a better predictor of default. It wouldn't have done well by any means: it only explains about 12 percent of default risk. Still, this simple statistical indicator does better than the S.&P. ratings. (Nor is it the case that some combination of debt-to-G.D.P. ratios and S.&P. ratings does better than either one taken alone. Once you'd accounted for a country's debt-to-G.D.P. ratio, the S.&P. ratings would not have improved your projections of default risk by a statistically significant margin.)
Certainly, one might contemplate more sophisticated models than this (for instance, accounting for a country's inflation rate in addition to its debt seems to be helpful). But when considerably more advanced studies have been published by academic economists like Carmen M. Reinhart, they have come to similar conclusions. Ms. Reinhart found that, although S.&P. rating changes have some value in predicting defaults, they are significantly outperformed by objective, statistical indicators.
One might reasonably protest that my study (although not Ms. Reinhart's) is comparing apples to oranges. Whereas S.&P. is attempting to forecast actual defaults, I'm instead looking at the market's as of today. None of these countries have actually defaulted yet. There's still the chance that the markets turn out to be wrong and S.&P. turns out to be right.
Here's the problem with that: S.&P. ratings tend to lag, rather than lead, the market. That is, in cases where the market's view of default risk is misaligned with S.&P.'s, S.&P. is a good bet to change their rating to catch up to market perception.
As I mentioned, for instance, investors had already determined that Irish debt and Greek debt had become quite risky long before S.&P. downgraded those countries. We can also study this in a slightly more formal way. Suppose that we're trying to predict what S.&P.'s rating for a country would be today based on two factors: S.&P.'s rating on June 30, 2009, and the market's perception of default risk (as determined through credit default swap prices) on the same date. 
If you place these variables into a regression equation, the market price of credit default swaps is a statistically significant predictor of what S.&P.'s rating would be two years later. What that implies is that the markets pick up on salient information about the countries' default risk before S.&P. does. 
In fact, the evidence from the past five years suggests that it may be worthwhile to adopt a contrarian investing strategy that specifically bets against S.&P.'s ratings. If you were trying to predict a country's default risk today, based on the market's perception of its default risk two years ago as well as its S.&P. rating at that time, you would find that accounting for S.&P. ratings actually value from your model. That is, if the market had priced two countries as having a 20 percent default risk in 2009, but one of them had a AA rating from S.&P. and the other had a BB rating, the country with the S.&P. rating is likely to have proven to be the safer bet.
The reason for this is that S.&P. ratings probably have some influence on market perceptions about default risk -- even though they aren't very good. If markets evaluate a country as having a 20 percent chance of default, but S.&P. rates it as being quite safe, that price represents a compromise between daft investors who take S.&P.'s ratings to be gospel, and savvier ones who have conducted their own analysis and have concluded that the country is at significant risk of default. By betting against S.&P.'s ratings, you're taking the side of the smart investors -- and getting a subsidy from the suckers who think S.&P.'s price is right.
But there is another "tell" to indicate that S.&P.'s ratings are slow to incorporate new information. It's something which they seem to think is a feature of their ratings, but which instead is evidence that they are fundamentally flawed.
The giveaway is that S.&P.'s rating changes are serially correlated -- that is, downgrades tend to follow downgrades, and upgrades tend to follow upgrades. According to the company's internal analysis, once a country is downgraded it has a 52 percent chance of being downgraded again in the next two years. By contrast, there is just a 9 percent chance that S.&P. will reverse course and upgrade the country.
What this implies is that S.&P.'s ratings are inefficient about how they incorporate new information. If a country is downgraded from AAA to AA, and that implies that the country is quite likely to be downgraded again in the near future, the question is why S.&P. didn't apply a steeper downgrade in the first place.
Consider the case, for instance, where I had a model to determine the value of shares in Google. Initially, my estimate had been that a price of $600 per share is appropriate. But then there is some shock to the system -- say, some fresh evidence that the country is on the verge of another recession and that this could adversely affect Google's profits. I estimate that $500 is now a fair price.
So I tell you that I'm willing to sell you Google shares, today, for $500. But I also tell you that tomorrow, I'm likely to lower my estimate further, so you can probably buy Google stock from me for $400 per share. 
No competent brokerage firm would ever convey that kind of information to investors. If I signal to you that I'm likely to accept a cheaper price tomorrow than I am today, nobody would buy at today's price.
But this is essentially what S.&P. does. Rather than downgrade (or upgrade) a country by several notches, even when there is abundant to support it, they instead do so in stages. Greek debt, for instance, has been downgraded times since January 2009, as S.&P. has slowly caught up with the grim realities that investors had long ago perceived. 
I suspect the reason that S.&P. behaves this way is because they know that their ratings can have reverberations on the market and are trying to avoid a sudden downgrade that might induce panic.
But in so doing, they are violating their mission of providing the most earnest and accurate assessment of a country's default risk at any given time. A country that is downgraded from AAA to AA is riskier, in S.&P.'s view, than one that was just upgraded from A to AA -- even though they now have the same rating -- since the former country is likely to be downgraded again and the latter is likely to be upgraded again. S.&P. knows this, and smart investors know this. But they won't tell you this because dumb investors might get spooked, which could rattle the markets. 
A more cynical view is that S.&P. is playing the role of the schoolmarm, looking for excuses to reward or punish countries based on good behavior -- and that this is getting in the way of their objectivity. Investors think, for instance, that France is 2 or 3 times more likely to default in the next five years than the United States based on France's exposure to Greek debt. However, France maintains its AAA rating whereas the U.S. was just downgraded to AA+. Arguably, it is not France's "fault" for being exposed to Greek debt -- whereas the United States' fiscal problems are largely of its own making. But France is probably the riskier bet all the same. 
None of this is necessarily to disagree with the downgrade in the United States' rating. A rating system based on objective factors, like debt-to-G.D.P. ratios, might plausibly have the U.S. rated even lower than AA+. 
Then again, investors still perceive the United States to be extremely safe. Based on the very low interest rates on Treasury bonds, as well as the low prices for credit default swaps on U.S. debt, investors continue to view it as among most likely countries in the world to meet its obligations. 
I'm not an efficient markets hypothesis guy. I think that markets can misprice commodities, and that canny investors can profit from them. But relying on the consensus of the market is almost certainly better than relying on Standard & Poor's, whose advice has more often than not led investors toward the losing side of bets. The fact that billions of dollars in wealth are tied up in the judgments of a company with such a poor record is all the proof you should require that the global financial system is in need of reform.

HIGHLIGHT: Who doesn't like Mondays? More turmoil in the markets is expected following the United States downgrade and European debt actions.

 BODY:
The world is a much different place than it was when Wall Street went home on Friday afternoon. 
United States stock futures this morning are poised to open sharply lower following Standard & Poor's downgrade of the United States' credit crediting on Friday evening. 
The Dow Jones industrial average futures are down 200 points and S.&P. futures are down 30 points less than three hours before the market open. European stocks are also lower, with London down 1.8 percent and Frankfurt down 2.5 percent. Gold prices are sharply higher. 
To many, the uncertainty and the speed of the developments is eerily reminiscent of 2008.
Here's a roundup of what has been happening over the last 24 hours:

HEADLINE: Who Trusts Governments?

BYLINE: FLOYD NORRIS


HIGHLIGHT: Intervention in the markets helped stocks in Europe -- but not for long.

 BODY:
The European Central Bank rode to the rescue today. But there was a limit to how much it could do.
European stock markets opened lower today at 3 a.m. (all times New York, to avoid confusion) and were down, although not by huge amounts. But within 20 minutes word spread that the central bank was buying Italian and Spanish bonds, as it had said it would do. Within minutes, the stock markets were in positive territory.
Futures contracts for the S.&P. 500 rallied more than 30 points within minutes, and it looked like this could be a relatively uneventful day.
Never mind. Markets resumed falling by 4 a.m.
The distinguishing fact about the summer plunge of 2011 is the lack of confidence in governments. It is not that people fear they will do the wrong things. It is fear that governments cannot, or perhaps will not, do much of anything.On Sunday night the G-7 finance ministers and central bankers, representing the world's major economies, tried to reassure the world that they would "take all necessary measures to support financial stability and growth in a spirit of close cooperation and confidence." This morning the G-20, which also includes large emerging markets, chimed in.
If there were any reason to believe there will be "close cooperation" the American government, this might be a better day. The Sunday talk shows provided an opportunity to send that signal, one that was not taken.
As it is, there is no sign that Republicans are willing to cooperate with Democrats on anything. President Obama's willingness to give in has made him appear weak and encouraged those who would slash government whatever the economic impact. And it has moved the government in a direction -- of cutting the fire hoses while the economy burns -- that is risky, to say the least.
Nouriel Roubini, an economist who gained fame for warning of the financial collapse, wrote in The Financial Times today:
So can we avoid another severe recession? It might simply be mission impossible. The best bet is for those countries that have not lost market access - the U.S., U.K., Japan, and Germany - to introduce new short-term fiscal stimulus while committing to medium-term fiscal austerity. The U.S. downgrade will hasten demands for fiscal reduction, but America in particular should commit to look for significant cuts in the medium term, not an immediate fiscal drag that will worsen growth and deficits. 
As the American stock market prepares to open, S.&P. futures are down about 30 points, and Dow futures are off about 250 points.
Of course, money must go somewhere. It is going to gold, and it is going to Treasury bonds. Notwithstanding the rating cut, Treasuries are still deemed safe. The yield on 10-year Treasuries is now about 2.46 percent.

HIGHLIGHT: While you were enjoying your weekend, The Caucus was gathering the top political quotes for your reading pleasure.

 BODY:
Miss the best of the political squabbling over the weekend? The Caucus has gathered up the best quotes for your reading pleasure.
1. Representative Michele Bachmann of Minnesota used news of the S.&P. downgrade to call for the resignation of Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner, putting the blame for the credit rating slide on the shoulders of the administration. "I call on the president to seek the immediate resignation of Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner and to submit a plan with a list of cuts to balance the budget this year, turn our economy around and put Americans back to work," she said in a statement on Saturday.
But if she thought that her words would move Mr. Geithner or his boss, President Obama, to accept her advice, she was mistaken. By Sunday, Mr. Geithner revealed that he had decided to stay on as Treasury secretary through the end of Mr. Obama's term. "Secretary Geithner has let the president know that he plans to stay on in his position at Treasury," Jenni LeCompte, a Treasury spokeswoman, said in a statement. "He looks forward to the important work ahead on the challenges facing our great country."
2. Rick Perry, the Republican governor of Texas, is apparently poised to jump into the presidential contest. But his attention was on more spiritual matters on Saturday as he hosted his prayer event in Houston. In front of about 30,000 people in Reliant Stadium, Mr. Perry prayed for the nation, drawing criticism along the way from those who accused him of improperly mixing government and religion. "Lord, you are the source of every good thing," Mr. Perry said. "You are our only hope, and we stand before you today in awe of your power and in gratitude for your blessings and humility for our sins. Father, our heart breaks for America. We see discord at home. We see fear in the marketplace. We see anger in the halls of government, and as a nation we have forgotten who made us, who protects us, who blesses us, and for that we cry out for your forgiveness."
3. The Sunday talk shows featured criticism of Mr. Obama for the credit downgrade. Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, was among the most colorful, saying that "If he were in the Southeastern Conference, he would be fired as a coach. He would not have his contract renewed." Mr. Graham added that Mr. Obama "is failing, and it's not the Tea Party's fault. What was hope and change is despair and confusion."
4. Tim Pawlenty, the former governor of Minnesota, continued his wall-to-wall campaigning in Iowa as the straw poll in Ames approaches. He criticized the president after the downgrade announcement, saying on Saturday: "Any bobblehead can stand up here and give you the words like Barack Obama did - dupe the Democrats in Iowa to catapult him on his way to the presidency - but we don't need any more speeches. What we need is results." 
Mr. Pawlenty appeared on Fox News Sunday and predicted that he would do better than expected in Saturday's straw poll, though recent polls show him trailing Mrs. Bachmann and Mitt Romney, the former governor of Massachusetts, in the state. "The proof will be in the pudding," Mr. Pawlenty said. "And I think you'll see our campaign moving up from back of the pack to closer to front of the pack."
5. Mr. Romney and Jon Huntsman, the former governor of Utah, also used the downgrade as an occasion to criticize Mr. Obama's leadership. Mr. Romney said that "America's creditworthiness just became the latest casualty in President Obama's failed record of leadership on the economy. Standard & Poor's rating downgrade is a deeply troubling indicator of our country's decline under President Obama. His failed policies have led to high unemployment, skyrocketing deficits, and now, the unprecedented loss of our nation's prized AAA credit rating." He added that "the only way things will get better is with new leadership in the White House."
Mr. Huntsman offered an indictment of not only the president, but politicians in Washington generally, saying: "Out-of-control spending and a lack of leadership in Washington have resulted in President Obama presiding over the first downgrade of the United States credit rating in our history. For far too long we have let reckless government spending go unchecked and the cancerous debt afflicting our nation has spread."

HIGHLIGHT: The Lede is following the upheaval in the global financial markets on Monday.

 BODY:
4:15 P.M. | U.S. Markets Close
At the close of trading, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index was off more than 6 percent, on top of a 7 percent loss incurred last week. The Dow Jones industrial average showed a one-day decline of more than 600 points, its steepest point loss in a single day since December 2008.
4:11 P.M. | Measuring the Gyrations
It's not just the losses, it's the volatility.
As the trading session went on the VIX, or fear index, which measures stock market volatility, continued to rise. It's spiked way above 40 to 45.76 today. (It was down at 16 just last month.) It's now back at levels not seen since March 2010 - that in turn was the highest measure of stock market volatility since March 2009.
According to the markets, the United States may not be the last sovereign to be downgraded, either. Investors are already searching for their next target: the credit default swap rates on French government debt - the cost of insuring French government debt against default - rose to record levels. Most analysts don't believe a French downgrade is anywhere near imminent but in these conditions some investors seem to be testing market sentiment.
Amid the global selloff, some of the worst hit stocks have been in emerging markets. The Brazilian stock market, for example, is down about 10 percent. - 
3:58 P.M. | Video of Obama's Remarks
Here, from the White House YouTube channel, is video of President Obama's remarks on the downgrade and the political and economic challenges ahead:
The White House has also posted a transcript of Mr. Obama's complete remarks.
2:33 P.M. | Obama's Remarks on the Economy
WASHINGTON - President Obama defended the country's credit worthiness on Monday, staunchly maintaining that despite the recent downgrading of the nation's long-term debt, that American credit status "remains AAA."
In his first public remarks since Standard & Poor's downgraded the country's debt on Friday, Mr. Obama sought to instill calm and a sense of debt-cutting purpose, even as the stock market was plunging. "Our problems are eminently solvable and we know what we need to do to solve them," Mr. Obama said, in remarks to reporters at the White House.
"What we need to do now is to combine those spending cuts with two additional steps: tax reform that will ask those who can afford it to pay their fair share and modest adjustments to health care programs like Medicare.
"Making these reforms doesn't require any radical steps," he said. "What it does require is common sense and compromise."
Mr. Obama acknowledged that his defense of the country's credit worthiness "doesn't mean we don't have a problem."
"We didn't need a ratings agency to tell us we need a long-term approach to deficit reduction," the president said. "And we didn't need a ratings agency to tell us that gridlock in Washington has not been constructive to say the least.
"We knew from the outset that a prolonged debate over the debt ceiling, a debate where the threat of default was used as a bargaining chip could do enormous damage to our economy and the world's," he said.
But amplifying the uphill task for Mr. Obama as he seeks to restore confidence in the country's leadership: most networks broadcasting his remarks included, at the bottom of their screens, trading in the New York Stock Exchange, where the Dow Jones Industrial Average dipped almost 50 points during the ten minutes that the president spoke, dipping to below 11,000 at one point.
Mr. Obama, as he has in the past, called for an extension of payroll tax cuts and unemployment benefits, both scheduled to expire at the end of the year. "The most immediate concern of most Americans is the issue of jobs," Mr. Obama said. He spoke of the "slow pace of recovery coming out of the worst recession in our lifetimes," and called for the extension of the payroll tax cut, which he said would put more money in the pockets of workers.
He criticized the tendency to "draw lines in the sand" that made compromise difficult.
"It's not a lack of plans or policies that's the problem here," Mr. Obama said. "It's a lack of political will."
He said he will be making his own recommendations in the next few weeks on ways to begin reducing the budget deficit.

1:51 P.M. | Your Stock Market Backup Plan
The time to plan your reaction to stock market corrections is before they actually happen, not when you are freaking out in the middle of them, says Carl Richards in The Times's Bucks blog.
1:37 P.M. | Echoes of 2008: Gold Up, Oil Down
The flight to safety today has driven the price of gold above $1,700, a nominal high. It's currently trading at $1,713, up $61.20 on the day, or 3.7 percent.
In case you're wondering, that still falls short of the one-day surge experienced after the failure of Lehman Brothers and the rescue of the American International Group in the tumultuous days of September 2008. On Sept. 17 that year, gold rose $70 in a single day - but was still only half its current level, at $847.10.
Meanwhile, oil prices, which also took a swift tumble as the financial crisis took hold in 2008, were down sharply today - just about as much as gold was up. Futures on West Texas intermediate crude oil have fallen back to $83.60, a decline of $3.28, or 3.8 percent. As recently as late last month they were touching $100.
1:05 P.M. | Bank Stocks Take a Hit
Amid the general sell-off, bank stocks seem to be coming under especially strong pressure.
The share price of Bank of America is down 16 percent (more from DealBook), Citi is down 10 percent and JPMorgan Chase is down 6.4 percent.
They are being swept up by the general pessimism but also the news that the American International Group plans to sue Bank of America over hundreds of mortgage-backed securities.
The suit seeks to recover more than $10 billion in losses on $28 billion of investments, in possibly the largest mortgage-security-related action filed by a single investor. - 
1:00 P.M. | A Twitter Debate
As the U.S. stock markets flounder, some analysts are arguing that we shouldn't put too much emphasis on them. Daniel Gross, a business columnist for Yahoo, noted on his Twitter feed:
Repeat after me: the stock market is not the economy. 90 percent rise didn't correlate to rapid gdp recovery in 09 and 10.Mon Aug 8 15:45:48 via Twitter for BlackBerryDaniel Grossgrossdm
Ryan Avent, a correspondent for The Economist, disagreed:
@grossdm It's not just equities. It's bond markets and commodity markets. All signs point to sharply falling output expectations.Mon Aug 8 15:53:36 via TweetDeckRyan Aventryanavent
- 
12:14 P.M. | Bank Funding Stress Levels
Bank funding stress levels still seem muted. Slightly worryingly, a measure of funding costs in the banking market, the Libor-OIS spread, has picked up. It is now at about 0.185 percent, around the highest level since August 2010. But it is still well below the rates seen in 2008 and 2009 when it ran up above 2 percent and even reached as high as 3.5 percent. -
12:07 P.M. | Obama to Speak on Economy
WASHINGTON - President Obama will address the economic crisis confronting the country at 1:30 p.m. ET on Monday, White House officials said.
Mr. Obama, who spent the weekend at Camp David grappling with the downgrading of the country's credit rating, is now facing a plummeting stock market. For the president, Monday's remarks can be seen as a leadership moment, particularly since he will be speaking as the markets are open.
White House officials say that Mr. Obama will also address, from the State Dining Room, the crash on Saturday of a Chinook helicopter in Afghanistan, which saw 30 Americans - 22 of them NAVY Seals - and eight Afghans killed. - 
11:57 A.M. | Clearinghouses Downgraded
The ratings downgrade extended today to yet another area -- the clearinghouses that stand behind the trading of securities.
S .&P said its rating for the Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation, the central depository for United States securities, would drop to AA+ from AAA. Three other clearinghouses - the National Securities Clearing Corporation, the Fixed Income Clearing Corporation, and the Options Clearing Corporation - saw their ratings similarly lowered.
Clearinghouses insure the integrity of trading between parties, acting to minimize risk. But ultimately the United States government stands behind the clearinghouses, so S.&P.'s judgment of the government's declining creditworthiness affected its implicit guarantee to the clearing process.
S.&P. said the lower credit rating for the United States "constrained the ratings" on the clearinghouses because their businesses and assets are concentrated in the domestic market. Moody's and Fitch have not taken similar action.
D.T.&C. clears provides clearing and settlement services for more than $36.5 trillion worth of securities, ranging from stock and bonds to some of the simpler types of derivatives. Traders frequently use government securities as collateral in processing those transactions.
A sudden drop in value or perceived creditworthiness of those instruments often causes clearinghouses to demand additional collateral to reflect the increased risk of processing that transaction - something known as a haircut.
But in a statement, the D.T.&C. said that it would not require investors that rely on its clearing operations to put up additional collateral in light of the S.&P. downgrade of government securities. "We do not anticipate any changes in our operations as a result of this revision of our credit rating," it said in a statement, noting the "fundamental strengths of our company" had not changed. -- 
11:33 A.M. | From the Exchange Floor
Speaking from the floor of the New York Stock Exchange, Jonathan Corpina of Meridian Equities Partners, a broker dealer, said the mood on the floor among traders and investors was more intense than ever. "The room is definitely louder. You are seeing a lot more activity. There is a lot more intensity."
They were nervous because the downgrade was an event none of them had ever experienced before. "This is something that none of us have ever experienced before in our business," he said. "We don;'t know what the ripple effects are going to be." - 
11:32 A.M. | Greece Bans Shortselling for Two Months
The Associated Press reports:
Greece has banned short selling on the stock market for two months from Tuesday, after shares on the Athens Stock Exchange plunged to their lowest level in more than 14 years.
The bourse's general index sank below the 1,000-point mark Monday, closing down 6 percent at 998.24 - the lowest level since January, 1997 - as financial markets were buffeted by worries over the U.S. economy following a downgrade of the country's debt.
The slide was markedly more than the declines recorded in other markets in Europe.
11:28 A.M. | Record Low for Two-Year Treasury Note
The two-year Treasury note was at a record low.
On expectations of a slowdown in growth, commodities were also falling. A basket of 24 commodities was about 3 percent lower. - 
11:21 A.M. | Perspectives from DealBook and FiveThirtyEight
Posts on two other Times blogs, DealBook and FiveThirtyEight, add some perspective to what is happening on Monday. 
Our colleagues at DealBook explain that although shares of banks and other financial institutions were down sharply on Monday morning, analysts were more sanguine, seeing little immediate impact from the S.&.P. ratings downgrade.
"S.&P.'s downgrade likely increases market uncertainty, but should not prove overly damaging to major U.S. banks, " Wells Fargo analysts wrote in a note on Monday. The analysts said that the decision by banking regulators to consider United States government obligations to have the risk-weighting at the same zero percent level as before "should help support the repo market."
On FiveThirtyEight, Nate Silver argues that Standard & Poor's ratings "are substandard and porous."
11:13 A.M. | Charting the 'Fear Index'
Amid the stock market sell-off, the Vix index, which some traders call the "fear index," neared 40 points, a key level.
It stood at 39.79, the highest reading since May 20, 2010, just weeks after the "flash crash" when the opening stage of the European debt crisis was roiling markets.
Just to see how far it has come, the Vix was at a reading of around 16 on July 8.
It is a gauge of financial stress many in the markets are watching closely. - Graham Bowley
11:11 A.M. | investors Flee to the Safety of U.S. Treasuries
Amid intense investor anxiety, both U.S. stocks and government bond yields are falling sharply as markets cut their expectations of economic growth and investors flee to the safety of U.S. Treasuries.
 Despite the downgrade of United States government debt by Standard & Poor's, investors are pouring into U.S. Treasury bonds, sending yields plummeting. 
"These kind of price moves are staggering," said Ajay Rajadhyaksha, an investment strategist at Barclays Capital. "Markets don't believe the ratings move and they are sharply repricing growth expectations across much of the world. Looking forward the markets are actually saying that things are much weaker."
The yield on the 10-year US Treasury was down 18 percentage points at 2.38 percent.
Gold, another save-haven asset for worried investors, was also rising. - 
11:02 A.M. | More on the Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac Downgrades
And another one hits the dust.
Standard & Poor's downgraded Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac Monday morning because of "their direct reliance on the U.S. government," the company said in a release.
By direct reliance, the ratings agency is referring to the government conservatorship that the two housing giants were placed in during the 2008 financial crisis. Both companies used to be private companies but they ran into trouble during 2008 because of their ownership of massive amounts of troubled mortgage bonds and their role in the housing market.
Fannie and Freddie are the lifeblood of the housing market because they guarantee the performance of mortgages that are placed in mortgage bonds. That means if a homeowner defaults, Uncle Sam comes in to make it up to the investors owning the bond with that loan. Fannie and Freddie's role has never been more important than it is now because mortgage bond investors are not buying many securities that contain loans without such a government guarantee.
The downgrade for the two housing giants is a move to AA+ from AAA. Much like Treasuries, many Fannie and Freddie securities are used in the market as security deposits backing investors' trades. The thing to watch here is whether banks and clearinghouses and others start demanding extra Fannie and Freddie bonds be put up for given trades since they are now downgraded.
In the same release Monday, Standard & Poor's also downgraded 10 of the 12 Federal Home Loan Banks to AA+ from AAA. (The other two, in Chicago and Seattle, are already rated AA+.) The Federal Farm Credit Banks also received the same downgrade, as did some government programs that backed debt for banks during the financial crisis like the Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program. Finally, the release also gave the same downgrade to AA+ to some debt guarantee by the National Credit Union Association.
The logic behind all of these is that these entities and programs would turn to the government for more money and support if they ran short of funds, and now, with the United States' downgrade last week, according to Standard & Poor's, the nation is a little less likely to make good on its promises. - 
11:01 A.M. | Standard & Poor's Explains New Downgrades
In a press release posted on its Web site a short time ago, Standard & Poor's explains its new downgrades, including the debt of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. The statement begins:
Standard & Poor's Ratings Services said today that it lowered its issuer credit ratings and related issue ratings on 10 of 12 Federal Home Loan Banks (FHLBs) and the senior debt issued by the FHLB System to 'AA+' from 'AAA'. We have also lowered the ratings on the senior debt issued by the Federal Farm Credit Banks to 'AA+' from 'AAA'. The ratings on the individual farm member banks are not affected.
In addition, we have lowered the senior issue ratings on Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to 'AA+' from 'AAA'. Our 'A' subordinated debt rating and our 'C' rating on the preferred stock of these entities remain unchanged. Finally, we have affirmed the short-term issue ratings for these entities at 'A-1+' and removed them from CreditWatch Negative where they were placed July 15, 2011.
The downgrades of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac reflect their direct reliance on the U.S. government. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were placed into conservatorship in September 2008 and their ability to fund operations relies heavily on the U.S. government. In addition to the implicit support we factor into our ratings, the U.S. Treasury has demonstrated explicit support by providing these entities with capital quarterly, as necessary.
The downgrades of 10 of the 12 FHLBs and the FHLB System's senior debt reflect a one-notch reduction in the U.S. sovereign rating. Before we downgraded the U.S., under our GRE criteria, 10 of the 12 FHLB banks were rated 'AAA', the same level as the U.S. sovereign because they have either 'aa+' or 'aa' stand-alone credit profiles and we classify them as having a very high likelihood of receiving support from the government if needed. The FHLBs of Chicago and Seattle were already rated 'AA+' prior to the U.S. sovereign downgrade as they have lower stand-alone credit profiles ('aa-' and 'a+', respectively) than the other 10 FHLBs. The FHLB System is classified as being almost certain to receive government support if necessary under our GRE criteria. Thus, the FHLB System debt is rated at the same level as the U.S. sovereign rating.
10:50 A.M. | Market Drops Following More Downgrades
The market took a sharper turn downward less than an hour into New York trading, as additional downgrades - including the debt of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac - were announced by Standard & Poor's. The Dow, which had been off by less than 200 points in the first half-hour, is now down by about 350.
10:43 A.M. | Who Trusts Governments?
In a new post on the Economix blog, our colleague Floyd Norris writes:
The European Central Bank rode to the rescue today. But there was a limit to how much it could do.
European stock markets opened lower today at 3 a.m. (all times New York, to avoid confusion) and were down, although not by huge amounts. But within 20 minutes word spread that the central bank was buying Italian and Spanish bonds, as it had said it would do. Within minutes, the stock markets were in positive territory.
Futures contracts for the S.&P. 500 rallied more than 30 points within minutes, and it looked like this could be a relatively uneventful day.
Never mind. Markets resumed falling by 4 a.m.
As Mr. Norris observes, the intervention by the European Central Bank in an effort to head off a panic over Spanish and Italian debt seemed to have a calming effect on the European markets - but not for long. Though yields on the bonds of Spain and Italy came down as hoped, stocks in Europe soon resumed their tumble. "The distinguishing fact about the summer plunge of 2011 is the lack of confidence in governments," Mr. Norris says. "It is not that people fear they will do the wrong things. It is fear that governments cannot, or perhaps will not, do much of anything."
Mr. Norris also points to an opinion piece published on Sunday evening in The Financial Times by Nouriel Roubini, an economist who gained fame for warning of the financial collapse, headlined: "Mission Impossible: Stop Another Recession."
10:22 A.M. | 'It Is Going to Be One of Those Days' on Wall Street
There were more traders than usual crowding the floor of the New York Stock Exchange at the opening, said Doreen Mogavero, a trader on the floor.
She said traders had canceled vacations and the exchange operator had brought in extra staff to make sure the systems were working properly as they anticipated a surge in volumes.
"I don't think we are going to get too much of a pop today but I am expecting it to move on the downside," she said midmorning, even as she then called out as the Dow dropped more than 200 points.
"It is the psychological impact that I am concerned about in terms of confidence on the market," she said.
She said traders were closely watching the VIX index, a measure of volatility. It was up more than 3 points, to around 36 - double the level it was just a few weeks ago.
Daily volumes on the New York Stock Exchange had increased each day last week, she said - and she expected turnover to increase again today. But she said investors should remain calm. "It is corporate earnings that drive the stock market. Some corporations are starting to guide earnings expectations lower but others are still fairly bright."
But as the Dow took another leg down, she added: "It is going to be one of those days. A lot of volatility." - 
9:54 A.M. | Wall Street Starts an Anxious Monday
With American markets opening for the first time since Friday night's announcement of a downgrade of long-term United States debt, it is shaping up as a volatile day on Wall Street.
In the opening minutes of trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was off more than 200 points. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index was off 2 percent, and the Nasdaq composite was down 3 percent.
Earlier, in Europe, after a weekend of nervous anticipation, stocks rallied after the European Central Bank said it would intervene aggressively in bond markets in Spain and Italy. But the stock rally soon turned sharply negative, with markets from Germany to Britain falling about 2 percent, as investors waited to see how traders in the United States would interpret the downgrade.
Asian markets had already taken something of a battering. The Tokyo benchmark Nikkei 225 stock average fell 2.2 percent. The main Sydney market index, the S&P/ASX 200, fell 2.9 percent. In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng index fell 2.2 percent, and in Shanghai the composite index closed 3.8 percent lower. 
The action by the E.C.B. had had a positive effect on European bond markets. The yield on 10-year Spanish bonds dropped by 83 basis points, and were down below 5.3 percent, while comparable Italian yields fell 79 basis points and were below 5.4 percent. Both yields had risen in recent weeks to above the painfully high 6 percent threshold. Traders will be watching to see whether those reductions in yields can be maintained.
In the face of all the market upheaval, the flight to safety continued. Gold rose to $1,701.40, up $49.60, or 3.01 percent.
It had been a difficult weekend for bankers and investors. Banks up and down Wall Street held hurried conference calls with worried clients to parse the decision by Standard & Poor's, the rating agency, to downgrade United States long-term debt.
On Monday morning, traders across Wall Street again waited nervously at their desks for the opening of trading - and finally an idea of how the market will interpret the downgrade, and what effect it might have on the economy.
Some expected that the move - long telegraphed - had already been discounted by the market. But coming at a difficult time with the United States economy on such fragile footing and growth remaining elusive - and Europe desperately trying to contain its debt crisis - anything that undermines already low confidence levels could create a ripple effect and further stall the recovery.
Despite the downgrade, United States Treasuries rallied on Monday morning. The yield on 10-year Treasuries was around 2.51 percent.
The yield rose in Asian trading following the downgrade, but fell back in early United States trading. This was in line with most analysts' expectations: the downgrade is expected to hit stock market confidence most, with Treasury bonds being bouyed by a flight to quality from investors worried about sclerotic economic growth around the world and the Euopean debt crisis.
Traders will be watching other important gauges of financial stress, particularly signs of whether problems are building in the banking sector. Despite the big sell-offs in Europe and the United States over the past two weeks, there has been little sign of a pick-up in overnight lending rates between banks,unlike during the financial crisis in 2008 when those markets nearly froze. -

HEADLINE: 10 Questions for Geithner

BYLINE: JOHN HARWOOD


HIGHLIGHT: Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner sat down with John Harwood of The New York Times and CNBC to discuss the credit rating downgrade

 BODY:
Shortly after announcing that he would remain on the job as President Obama's Treasury secretary rather than leave the administration and return home to New York, Timothy F. Geithner sat down with John Harwood of The New York Times and CNBC on Sunday to discuss Standard & Poor's decision to downgrade the United States government's credit rating and America's economic road ahead. Below is a condensed, edited view of their conversation. 
1. S&P downgraded Friday night. Over the weekend, Michelle Bachmann, the Republican presidential candidate, among others, said you should resign. Today you did the opposite and announced that you're staying. Why?
GEITHNER: I believe in this president, John. I believe in what he's trying to do for the country. I love my work. And I think if a president asks you to serve, you have to do it. And we have men and women dying to protect the country in Afghanistan. We have unemployment above 9 percent. Still trying to heal the scars of this crisis. We have a lot of work to do.
2: Do you feel that you or the administration's policies are in any way responsible for this downgrade?
GEITHNER: Absolutely not. You've seen the president work incredibly hard and make really amazing progress trying to heal the damage caused by this terrible crisis. And you saw him work his heart out to try and bring both parties together to reach agreement on a long-term fiscal deal. Made some progress, didn't solve it all, but a very good down payment.
3. Alan Greenspan, former chairman of the Federal Reserve, today said that markets would react negatively, that it's been a blow to the psyche of the United States. What is your message to investors?
GEITHNER: Let's just start with this particular judgment by S&P. I think S&P has shown really terrible judgment, and they've handled themselves very poorly. And they've shown a stunning lack of knowledge about basic U.S. fiscal budget math. And I think they drew exactly the wrong conclusion from this budget agreement.
They, like many people, looked at this terrible debate we've had over the past few months, should the U.S. default or not. That was very damaging. Congress ultimately owns the credit rating of the United States. They have the power of the purse on the Constitution. And they're going to have a chance now to earn back confidence of investors around the world. But our country is much stronger than Washington. We have a very resilient economy. And I have enormous confidence in the basic regenerative capacity of the American economy and the American people.
4. Are U.S. treasuries as safe this week as they were last week?
GEITHNER: The judgment by S&P changed nothing. It added nothing to what people know about this country. There's no risk the U.S. would never meet its obligations. We've got some challenges ahead of us, but we'll be able to work with those challenges. We'll get through this.
5. You said a moment ago that Congress owns the credit rating. John Kerry, Democratic senator, said today, "This is the Tea Party downgrade." Is that right?
GEITHNER: I'm not going to do politics. If we've learned anything these last few months, it's time to put the economy ahead of politics. Again, these are challenges facing the country of the United States, not facing one party or the other. We both have some responsibility for coming together to dig our way out of this stuff.
6. Help the average American who's been absorbing this information this weekend: what's going to happen to the interest rates on their mortgages, their car loans, their business loans?
GEITHNER: I don't like to talk about markets. It's hard to know what'll happen in this context. But I think that everyone can be confident, both here and around the world, that treasuries are the strongest place to put your money at a time like this.
You'll see markets reset. Interest rates are very, very low. Those interest rates reflect the confidence of the world.
7. Why should anybody expect that the political system will function more effectively going forward than it has so far?
GEITHNER: Because it always has in the past and it always will. That's the great strength about this country. Faced with tremendous challenge, our country has shown a unique and extraordinary capacity over time to act, with a tremendous record of judgment in crisis over time. 
8. China said over the weekend that the United States has to cure its addiction to debt. are you worried that they're going to stop lending us money?
GEITHNER: No concern about that. I'm sure they'll be strong investors in the U.S. going forward, as will investors around the world. There's no surprise that the U.S. has a long-term and unsustainable fiscal position. 
We can't solve it overnight. It would be damaging, counterproductive to try to solve it overnight, because we have an economy still healing.
9. Have the headwinds you've referred to made a double-dip recession a possibility?
GEITHNER: I don't think that's likely, but it depends on the quality of judgments of the governments and central banks.
10. How did you feel when you got the word that S&P was downgrading? Were you angry?
GEITHNER: I won't characterize what I felt at that point. (CHUCKLES) But just look at the quality of judgments they've made in the past.

HEADLINE: Nothing New in Obama Remarks

BYLINE: FLOYD NORRIS


HIGHLIGHT: If the president had nothing new to say, why did he say it?

 BODY:
Presidential addresses on days of market panics seldom accomplish very much, but it is not really easy to see why the one President Obama gave this afternoon was scheduled. He got there later than promised. He announced nothing new. He had the same old suggestions for what the government should do -- some of them quite reasonable -- but gave no reason to hope that the Republicans would agree to any of them.
The Dow promptly lost another 100 points. 
It would be nice to hear what, if anything, the president will do if his pleas fall on deaf ears. The current assumption is that he will do nothing except sound hurt.

HEADLINE: The Presider and the Fighter

BYLINE: ROSS DOUTHAT


HIGHLIGHT: Would Hillary Clinton have succeeded where Barack Obama has failed?

 BODY:
The Daily Beast's Leslie Bennetts has a story about prominent New York Democrats (all anonymous, of course) who wish that Hillary Clinton were president instead of the man they voted for three years ago:
At a New York political event last week, Republican and Democratic office-holders were all bemoaning President Obama's handling of the debt-ceiling crisis when someone said, "Hillary would have been a better president."
"Every single person nodded, including the Republicans," reported one observer.
At a luncheon in the members' dining room at the Metropolitan Museum of Art on Saturday, a 64-year-old African-American from the Bronx was complaining about Obama's ineffectiveness in dealing with the implacable hostility of congressional Republicans when an 80-year-old lawyer chimed in about the president's unwillingness to stand up to his opponents. "I want to see blood on the floor," she said grimly.
... Looking as if she were about to cry, an 83-year-old Obama supporter shook her head. "I'm so disappointed in him," she said. "It's true: Hillary is tougher."
To some extent, this kind of angst is related to the intellectual habit that I talk about in my column today. Partisans on both sides keep waiting for a transformative, realigning election that sweeps all their enemies away, and when the realignment doesn't happen or seems to happen and then fizzles, they try to pin the blame on personalities rather than looking at deeper trends. No one can doubt that Barack Obama has made his share of his mistakes and then some. But liberals pining for a different kind of president need to recognize that with unemployment at 9 percent and the deficit to the moon, the toughest, meanest, readiest-for-a-knife-fight liberal in the world would be having difficulties advancing a left-of-center agenda, or any agenda at all. (Unless you think that Hillary Clinton would have singlehandedly saved the housing market, propped up the Euro, and so on down an increasingly fantastic list ...)
With that said, though, the Obama style of leadership - above-the-fray, faintly pedantic, deeply invested in its own reasonability - does feel singularly ill-suited to an era of divided government, ideological polarization and tough economic times. In a sense, Obama has turned out to be the kind of president you want if you really having major ideological realignment, and what your party needs is a figure capable of presiding in style, and putting a handsome, high-minded, highly-intelligent face on the new political consensus. In a world where the White House could relax about the economy and focus on trying to co-opt the Jon Huntsmans of the world with a post-partisan charm offensive, Barack Obama would be sitting pretty. But in a world where the administration's main challenge is negotiating with an ideologically-entrenched opposition confident that history is moving in their direction, I can see why Democrats would pine for Hillary Clinton's experience with Washington infighting instead.
They just need to recognize that any Clinton advantage would be marginal rather than decisive. More effective negotiating tactics and a more visceral understanding of the American psyche (I suspect that a President Hillary wouldn't have waited 72 hours to comment on the S&P downgrade, for instance) might have earned a hypothetical Clinton White House slightly more left-tilting legislative compromises and slightly better polling numbers. But no alternative president would have been able to usher in the kind of quasi-utopian scenario that many progressives seem to imagine would have been possible if only Barack Obama hadn't let them down.

HEADLINE: Rick Perry to Make Clear He Intends to Run

BYLINE: JEFF ZELENY


HIGHLIGHT: Gov. Rick Perry of Texas is preparing to make clear his intentions to join the Republican presidential race.

 BODY:
DES MOINES -- Gov. Rick Perry of Texas is preparing to make clear his intentions to join the Republican presidential race, two associates said, by visiting South Carolina and New Hampshire on Saturday -- the same day several of his potential rivals are taking part in the Iowa Straw Poll.
Mr. Perry, who has been inching closer to declaring his candidacy for weeks, is expected to stop short of making a formal announcement. But appearing before Republican crowds in the two early-voting states was intended to clear up any lingering questions about his plans.
"With President Obama's dismal economic record and Texas' success in creating jobs and balancing our budget, Governor Perry continues to consider a potential run for The White House," said Mark Miner, a spokesman for Mr. Perry, who declined to elaborate on the timing of any announcement. "Stay tuned."
The decision by Mr. Perry is likely to roil the Republican presidential nominating contest. His actions were first reported by Politico on Monday afternoon. 
Mr. Perry is expected to visit Iowa as soon as next week, a Republican official said. A draft movement has been under way in the state for weeks, with admirers of Mr. Perry recruiting supporters across Iowa, whose caucuses open the Republican nominating contest early next year.
For weeks, Mr. Perry has been calling party activists and Republican officials in Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina, trying to build support for his candidacy. He also has been working to line up a fund-raising operation that could compete with his rival Republicans, particularly Mitt Romney, who has significantly outpaced the rest of the field.
Henry Barbour, a member of the Republican National Committee from Mississippi, has been among the party leaders visiting Austin in recent weeks to urge Mr. Perry to run.
"Governor Perry is authentic, a truth-teller and a job-creating machine in Texas," said Mr. Barbour, whose uncle is Mississippi's Republican governor, Haley Barbour. "And it sure helps to come from a big donor state like Texas, if you are going to run for president. He will be able to raise the money to compete with Romney."

HEADLINE: Disaster Movie Gets a Sequel, With Subtitles

BYLINE: ANDREW ROSS SORKIN


HIGHLIGHT: In an interview, Henry M. Paulson Jr., the former Treasury secretary, said the crisis this time stemmed from Europe's fiscal problems.

 BODY:
It is beginning to feel a lot like 2008 all over again. But it's not the same.
As markets tumble - the Dow Jones industrial average fell 5.6 percent on Monday - it is instructive to hear from someone who knows a thing or two about a financial crisis: Henry M. Paulson Jr., the former Treasury secretary.
 And he turns out to be more sanguine about the United States, after the Standard & Poor's downgrade, than some other voices being heard amid the tumult.
"While the players in Washington certainly haven't performed at AAA level, I would certainly take U.S. Treasuries over other AAA sovereigns any day," Mr. Paulson told me.
Yes, there has been much hue and cry over S.&P.'s cut in the credit rating of the United States. But the credit rating downgrade almost seems like a bad joke considering what happened in the bond market: Treasuries rallied as yields fell on Monday to their lowest levels since 2009. In other words, investors felt Treasuries were a safer - yes, safer - bet after S.&P. downgraded them than they were before. (What does that say about S.& P.'s credibility in the bond market?)
The downgrade may point up the enormous challenges facing the country - persistent unemployment and the possibility of slower economic growth is a hard truth that may ultimately force the cost of borrowing to rise for the nation over the long term.
But the downgrade is almost a sideshow compared with the real reason that stocks started falling Monday morning, before panic set in and the momentum of the market took over: the intractable problems in the European Union, which look a lot more like the United States banking crisis circa 2008 than what's happening on this side of the Atlantic now.
Pretend for a moment that countries like Greece, Spain and Italy are our banks in 2008. They are close to insolvent. (And the actual banks in Germany, Britain and France that are supposed to be strong are horribly undercapitalized and are holding too much debt from countries like Greece, Spain and Italy - all countries that truly may not be able to pay it back in full.)
As Mr. Paulson told me, "The most pressing and significant problems in the global economy are unsustainable structural issues with regard to the E.U. - fiscal deficits and the structure of the E.U. itself."
This story might not grab as much attention, but it is this plight that is manifesting itself in the market.
The problem is that without any one individual in charge in Europe, there is virtually no possibility for someone to emerge the way that Mr. Paulson did during the panic of 2008 with a lifeline like the Troubled Asset Relief Program, a plan he practically had to ram down the throat of Congress. (And there's no money for such a program unless a coalition is formed.)
Say what you want about TARP - it was clearly unpopular - but in retrospect, it is hard to argue that it did not keep the economy from going off a cliff. A handful of people with conflicting interests could never come up with such a program. "The E.U. is an odd construct - multiple political systems with disparate economies and fiscal policies but a single currency and monetary system," he said.
Now, just as was the case in the fall of 2008 before Lehman Brothers collapsed, the panicked rumor mill in Europe is in full swing. On Monday, traders were passing along rumors that a French bank and an Italian bank were on the verge of collapse. (There's no evidence that the rumors are true, but the concern is that such chatter can become a self-fulfilling prophesy.)
In Greece, regulators announced a two-month ban on short-selling to prevent investors from betting against stocks. Sounds just like 2008, right?
And when and if there is another bank in Europe - or worse, an entire country - on the precipice, it is unlikely there will be the political will to bail it out. Yes, just like Lehman Brothers.
In the United States, the speculation game jumped the pond. This time it centered on Bank of America, after a report that David Tepper, the founder of the hedge fund Appaloosa Management, had dumped his entire 17-million-share stake in the bank. (In truth, he has sold about 40 percent of his stake.)
Still, Mr. Paulson said he was less worried about the troubles in the financial sector of Wall Street than in Europe. "In the U.S., our capital markets and banks are stable and much better capitalized and better regulated than they were," he said.
But he did suggest that the problems in Europe could be a lesson for us if we didn't get our house in order, echoing a thought that S.&P. made when it downgraded our long-term debt.
"Many of the Western democracies - including the U.S. - have a problem that voters want benefits they don't want to pay for," Mr. Paulson said.
Nonetheless, Mr. Paulson said he actually took some solace in the debate over the debt ceiling, despite its ugliness.
"The good news over the last six months or so - beginning with Bowles-Simpson - is that there is now a much better understanding of what is by far our biggest structural economic problem," he said referring to the Bowles-Simpson bipartisan fiscal commission that looked at ways to cut the deficit.
"Bowles-Simpson was particularly helpful by highlighting the fact that we are such a wealthy country that if we act soon we can deal with this problem with shared sacrifice but without any segment of our society having to sacrifice too much."
Mr. Paulson, a longtime Republican, even appeared to break with party ranks by going so far as to opine that slashing spending wasn't the only answer. "The most discouraging fact is that, as important as expense-cutting is - and it is essential that we cut - we can't just cut our way out of this problem."
His comment implied that a tax overhaul - and the possibility of raising revenue, a prospect that most Republicans have castigated - may need to be on the negotiating table as part of any solution.
Unfortunately, while Mr. Paulson may be bullish on the long-term prospects for the United States and the nation's ability to pay back its debts, he is less convinced that a solution will come anytime soon.
"We need fundamental, structural reform and that is impossible without bipartisan compromise and cooperation," he said, "which doesn't appear to be forthcoming before an election which changes the players."

HEADLINE: Aug. 8, 1974 | President Nixon Announces His Resignation

BYLINE: KATHERINE SCHULTEN


HIGHLIGHT: On Aug. 8, 1974, Richard Milhous Nixon, the 37th president of the United States, announced that he would resign from office, effective at noon the following day.

 BODY:
On Aug. 8, 1974, Richard Milhous Nixon, the 37th president of the United States, announced that he would resign from office, effective at noon the following day.
The New York Times article about the resignation speech reported that Mr. Nixon "may well have delivered his most effective speech since the Watergate scandals began to swamp his Administration in early 1973," and quoted him as saying: "I have never been a quitter. To leave office before my term is completed is opposed to every instinct in my body."
The Times article reported that Mr. Nixon did not have the votes in Congress to escape impeachment in the House and conviction in the Senate. It further quoted Mr. Nixon as saying, "To continue to fight through the months ahead for my personal vindication would almost totally absorb the time and attention of the President and the Congress in a period when our entire focus should be on the great issues of peace abroad and prosperity without inflation at home."
The Watergate scandal began at 2:30 a.m. on June 17, 1972, when five men were caught trying to bug the Democratic National Committee's office at the Watergate Hotel in Washington. The men were found to have connections to President Nixon's re-election campaign.
The F.B.I. launched an investigation into their links to the presidency. Two writers for The Washington Post, Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein, published the results of their own investigation, with help from a secret source: Mark Felt, an F.B.I. official who became known by the code name "Deep Throat."
The Senate also held three months of hearings, and two special prosecutors also investigated the case.
In late July 1974, the House of Representatives began the impeachment process, charging Mr. Nixon with obstruction of justice, abuse of power and contempt of Congress.
On Aug. 5, a tape recording from June 1972 was released, revealing that President Nixon and the White House chief of staff, H. R. Haldeman, had conspired to thwart the F.B.I. investigation. This disclosure ended any realistic hope that Mr. Nixon could remain as president. A month later, on Sept. 8, 1974, President Gerald R. Ford granted former President Nixon "a full, free and absolute pardon for all offenses against the United States" committed during the period of his presidency, freeing him from the possibility of indictment or prosecution for his role in the Watergate scandal.
After resigning from the presidency, Mr. Nixon spent his later life traveling, writing and speaking about foreign policy. He died on April 22, 1994, after suffering a stroke.
Connect to Today:
The New York Times obituary for Mr. Nixon stated that "he never completely dispelled the sense of shame that clung to his last days in the White House." However, it also stated that he "wrought foreign policy accomplishments of historic proportions. He reopened American relations with China in 1972. He began the rapprochement with the Soviet Union with the signing of the first treaty limiting the potentially deadly nuclear arms race. And after at first broadening and intensifying the conflict in Indochina, he ended American involvement in the fighting there."
Whom would you admire more - a politician with many accomplishments who resigned in disgrace for unethical behavior, or one with more modest accomplishments but absolute integrity? What other examples of each type of political figure can you think of?

HEADLINE: Recording Industry Chairman Named to Lead Automotive Trade Group

BYLINE: JONATHAN SCHULTZ


HIGHLIGHT: Mitch Bainwol will be expected to restore a cohesive voice to the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, whose membership recently split on the topic of fuel-efficiency standards.

 BODY:
As reported by our colleagues at Media Decoder, the chairman and chief executive of the Recording Industry Association of America, Mitch Bainwol, has stepped down to lead the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, a lobbying group that represents the interests of the 12 largest automakers in the United States.
Mr. Bainwol will begin his new job on Sept. 1, according to a statement issued by the alliance on Monday. At the R.I.A.A., Mr. Bainwol helped coordinate the recording industry's response to digital piracy, resulting in judgments against individual listeners and the dismantling or significant weakening of peer-to-peer file-sharing platforms, notably Grokster and LimeWire.
Mr. Bainwol's experience in navigating polemical issues like copyright infringement and intellectual property were among the skills praised by the alliance in its official statement, skills that Mr. Bainwol surely will employ at his new post.
The alliance was a highly visible, and audible, presence leading up to the White House's announcement of its proposal to raise Corporate Average Fuel Economy, known as the CAFE standards, to 54.5 miles per gallon by 2025. In the weeks before President Obama's announcement on July 29, the alliance ran radio advertisements around the country that warned against the prospect of too-strict standards, claiming that they would hinder the auto industry's recovery from the global financial crisis of 2008 and 2009.
In a reflection of its fractious membership, the alliance did not issue a formal statement after the standards were announced. Volkswagen and Mercedes-Benz were among the most outspoken critics of the president's proposal, claiming that the standards did not sufficiently acknowledge the benefits of clean-diesel technology for meeting efficiency targets.
Mr. Bainwol, who also worked as a budget analyst for the White House under Ronald Reagan, will be expected to restore a cohesive voice to the alliance. He succeeds Dave McCurdy, the former Oklahoma congressman who has led the group since 2007.

HEADLINE: What Will Stop the Drop?

BYLINE: FLOYD NORRIS


HIGHLIGHT: Political leadership would help the situation. So would a credible plan to assure decently functioning financial systems in Europe and the United States.

 BODY:
What will stop this?
Let's look at some of the things that have not worked.
The G-7 finance ministers promised to act together in a cooperative way.
President Obama assured us that he wanted to cooperate with Republicans.
It would be wonderful - and most likely would lead to a rebound - if there were evidence that genuine cooperation was going to arrive, and that governments would act together to try to both fix the financial systems and avoid new downturns. But so far there is no indication that any such thing will happen. 
If that cannot be, some bold leadership from someone - preferably someone with the ability to borrow lots of money - would be welcome. But the president seems unwilling to do anything but issue pleas that fall on deaf ears. Chancellor Angela Merkel has grudgingly moved but is unwilling or unable to try to persuade Germany that it must step up far more than it has.
Picking one cause for the recent slide is not easy. But in retrospect one should not rule out the European bank stress tests, whose results came out on July 20. This time, we were promised, the tests would be credible. But when they arrived, we learned that Europe was still assuming that European sovereign debts were risk-free. The collapse started soon after that.
I am in no position to crow - I was more optimistic about the economy than most were last year, and I was wrong. But it now appears clear that the financial crisis never really ended. The amount of capital wasted in the boom years continues to drag economies down. But there is no real discussion of how to deal with that.
An important lesson that leaders grasped in 2008 and 2009 was that free enterprise was not going to work without a decently functioning financial system. It is a lesson that may need to be learned again.
It was just six months ago today that American financial stocks hit their recent highs. Since then, the collapse has not spared any bank. But the ones hit particularly hard have had some combination of the following:
1. Leftover liabilities from the bad old days of lending without much regard for credit quality, secure in the knowledge that loans could be sold to someone else before they went bad.2. A lot of European sovereign debt.3. Doubts about the level, or accuracy, of the bank's capitalization.4. Particularly for some regional banks in the United States, commercial real estate loans that should never have been made.
The KBW bank indexes for the United States and Europe contain 24 stocks each. More than a third of them have lost more than a third of their value in six months. 
They are:
1. Bank of America, U.S., down 55.4%2. Commerzbank, Germany, down 55.3%3. Lloyds Banking, Britain, down 49.5%4. Societe Generale, France, down 45.4%5. National Bank of Greece, Greece, down 45.2%6. Regions Financial, U.S., down 43.5%7. Barclays, Britain, down 43.3%8. Citigroup, U.S., down 42.8%9. Suntrust, U.S., down 42.6%.10. Intesa Sanpaulo, Italy, down 42.2%11.

HEADLINE: Defining Economic Interest

BYLINE: NANCY FOLBRE


HIGHLIGHT: Many Tea Party members do not seem to recognize which policies are in their own interest, an economist writes.

 BODY:
Republican resistance to raising taxes represents a distinctly minority view. The latest New York Times/CBS poll shows that only 34 percent of adults believe that taxes should not be increased on households earning $250,000 or more to lower the budget deficit. Even this modest percentage surprises me, because only about 2 percent of American households report income above this amount.
Most conservative economists argue that higher tax rates at the top would hurt everyone because they would lower economic growth. I don't buy this argument for a variety of reasons that I've explained elsewhere. However, the argument seems pretty easy to sell.
People don't always recognize and effectively act on their economic interests. As one of my favorite behavioral economists, Dan Ariely, put it, we are all more like Homer Simpson than Superman.
I've always identified more with Marge Simpson than with Homer, but in any case, if the Simpsons don't act on what we believe are their economic interests, economists should be able to explain why.
Reaching for a better understanding of the Tea Party seems like a good place to start, since it gets much of the credit or blame for current Republican priorities.

According to last week's poll, Tea Party members are slightly better educated and more prosperous than the typical American. Still, only 17 percent earned more than $100,000 a year and 2 percent earned more than $250,000. I wish the survey had asked how many were unemployed or working in the public sector.
Some evidence suggests that the Tea Party's interests are shaped by its racial composition. Surveys show that it includes few African-Americans (3 percent of the total) and has greater membership in the South than in other regions (41 percent of voters compared with 15 percent in the Northeast).
At that time, a majority reported that they believed that "too much has been made of the problems facing black people" (52 percent compared with 28 percent of all Americans).
Asked to volunteer what they don't like about President Obama, the top answer, offered by 19 percent of Tea Party supporters, was that they just didn't like him.
The most recent poll confirms this animus: Only 12 percent of Tea Party supporters approve of President Obama's job performance, compared with 20 percent of Republicans and 48 percent of Americans.
Dislike and disapproval obviously inclined them to support Republicans who gave the president a hard time. But as Kate Zernike pointed out in a recent article in The New York Times, Tea Party members did not line up squarely behind those who wear their mantle in Congress. A CBS News poll taken in mid-July showed that 53 percent of Tea Party members, along with 66 percent of all respondents, favored a combination of tax increases and spending cuts.
One self-identified Tea Party Web site goes so far as to decry wealth inequality and calls for a progressive tax on wealth.
So why did Tea Party Republicans in Congress take such a hard line? Their views -- like those of most other elected representatives -- are not primarily shaped by the views of their constituents.
While the Tea Party movement got a big initial boost from small donors, its elected representatives quickly began relying on political action committees and major contributions from Wall Street firms. These almost certainly grew after the Supreme Court, in its Citizens United decision in January 2010, loosened campaign finance restrictions.
Many Tea Party members may be unaware of the extent to which wealthy political conservatives like the Koch brothers have bankrolled their efforts and shaped legislative priorities.
Partly because it does enjoy significant grass-roots support, the Tea Party has helped Republicans deflect attention from growing concerns about economic inequality and class conflict.
But these concerns are likely to intensify as unemployment rates remain high and the economy moves back toward official recession.
An ABC News/Washington Post poll conducted last month found that most Americans said the biggest difference between President Obama and Republicans lay in whose economic interests they aimed to serve.
Perceived differences based on household income categories, like the "$250,000" benchmark, seem less salient than those based on big business versus everybody else.
A striking 67 percent of Americans said Republicans were protecting the interests of large business corporations, compared with 24 percent who believe the same of President Obama (see chart below).
Meanwhile, the Tea Party is taking the fall. Its popularity has declined significantly in recent months. The latest New York Times/CBS News poll found the Tea Party was viewed unfavorably by 40 percent of the public, up from 29 percent in April.
As the economy nosedives, Tea Party populists are likely to become even less popular. And perhaps Tea Party members will change their perception of where their own economic interests lie.

HEADLINE: Santorum Takes His Message to Iowa Voters

BYLINE: MICHAEL D. SHEAR


HIGHLIGHT: With the Ames Straw Poll just days away, former Senator Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania and his seven children are working their way through all 99 Iowa counties. 

 BODY:
AMES, Iowa -- Rick Santorum quickly admits that he is the only Republican presidential candidate whose name recognition has barely budged since he began campaigning for the Oval Office.
But he's out to change that, even if it's just a handful of people at a time.
With the Ames Straw Poll just days away, Mr. Santorum, the former senator from Pennsylvania, and his seven children are working their way through all 99 Iowa counties -- they've been in 62 since his campaign began. On Monday morning, he arrived to find about 20 people at the Cafe Diem coffee shop on Main Street. 
His message: I can beat Obama. 
"Only one person has done what's necessary to defeat a Democratic incumbent," Mr. Santorum said, noting his defeat of an incumbent senator who was aided by former Bill Clinton strategists. "We went up against Carville and Begala -- and we won!"
The smattering of customers at the small coffee house seemed skeptical, if appreciative, of his invective against regulations, Washington politicians, President Obama and abortion.
"He's right on what I think needs to happen," said Dick Clem, 70 , a retirement planning adviser. But Mr. Clem said was not sure whether he would support Mr. Santorum. "I'm not saying that right now."
John Scheppler, 52, who owns a small construction business in Ames, is also not sure about whether Mr. Santorum would be able to go head-to-head with Mr. Obama in a debate.
"I think he would need to be a little more concrete," Mr. Scheppler said.
For Mr. Santorum, the 40-minute question-and-answer session was the beginning of a long week of small events all over the state. Aides are officially hoping for a fourth-place finish in the straw poll, behind Michele Bachmann, Ron Paul and Tim Pawlenty -- though they admit to secretly hoping to end up ahead of Mr. Pawlenty when the dust settles on Saturday.
It's a long road. Mr. Santorum received his first smattering of applause for a line about getting rid of "czars" from the government. 
The event took place before the stock market opened. But in an indication of what's on people's minds here, the first question, from Mr. Clem, was about what Mr. Santorum would do to create jobs and deal with the nation's economy.
After explaining that the recession was caused by spikes in energy prices that "led into the housing bubble and everything else," Mr. Santorum said the keys to economic recovery were more energy exploration, more manufacturing, less regulation and lower taxes.
He promised to work hard during the next weeks and months to prove that he is the man to do the job.
"No one's ever going to work harder," he promised. "Period. End of story."

HEADLINE: What Once Seemed Too Far Is Now Just Right

BYLINE: By DIANE CARDWELL

 BODY:
Many years ago, back when 96th Street was the bright-line border separating the upper reaches of the Upper East Side and East Harlem, Darin White, an executive at a major search firm, had a friend who lived in a nice prewar building on East 98th Street.
''I remember thinking, 'Hmm, that seems far,' '' Ms. White said. ''It just shows how naive I was.'' 
But as the neighborhood has changed, so has that perception. After living in Carnegie Hill for years and looking on the East Side for a move-in-ready apartment large enough to accommodate her growing family, Ms. White is heading north, among the first buyers at 1212 Fifth Avenue, a luxury condominium carved out of a prewar rental at 102nd Street.
Getting there was a three-year process, while Ms. White and her husband, a banker, acclimated themselves to the area and the north end of Central Park, shedding the concern that their friends would not visit or send their nannies over.
''I was really worried -- I was wondering how people would get there, would it be convenient, and now I have none of that fear because of the overall quality of living of what you're going to get there,'' she said.
''It's not only a prewar, renovated space that's got traditional and modern components, it's giving us complete park views, and is in a neighborhood with schools that we want,'' Ms. White added, alluding to several well-regarded private schools within walking distance.
There have always been, and will always be, barriers in real estate, lines that certain buyers will not cross, including, once upon a time, Columbus Avenue on the Upper West Side and Seventh Avenue in Park Slope, Brooklyn. But as people of means continue to crowd the city, those lines have been shifting.
On Fifth Avenue, part of that shift has been driven by Mount Sinai Medical Center, which sold 1200 Fifth to a group of investors, and 1212 Fifth to Durst Fetner Residential in 2009. The company is also building a market-rate rental tower just east of 1212 for the hospital. The medical center has built a new research lab on 102nd Street, along with other new buildings on 101st Street, and it has plans for more construction farther north.
''One day, I looked down 101st Street and I thought how pretty it was, and how different it was than when I came here in 1969,'' Dr. Kenneth L. Davis, the center's chief executive, said. ''What an enormous transformation.''
In addition, Robert A. M. Stern has designed a new condominium at 1280 Fifth, between 109th and 110th Streets, and the Central Park Conservancy has been busy restoring the plantings and grounds that were destroyed by an August 2009 storm, which took out 500 trees in less than half an hour.
The conservancy has been working on that end of the park since the 1980s, said Douglas Blonsky, the group's president and Central Park administrator, but he added that the recent projects had added ''new value uptown.''
For all of that, though, much of the neighborhood remains poor, particularly in the George Washington Carver Houses, a nearly 15-acre project running from 99th to 106th Streets between Park and Madison Avenues, where average household income is $23,742.
''There are a large number of public housing projects there, and they're not going to go away, and they anchor the neighborhood,'' said John H. Mollenkopf, director of the Center for Urban Research at the City University of New York. ''So it will always be a somewhat poor neighborhood.''
Even if the economics remain the same, and the gulf between Fifth Avenue and its eastern neighbors widens, the ethnic mix is changing, Mr. Mollenkopf said. Once heavily Italian, the area became home to Puerto Ricans and blacks and is now becoming more Mexican. But the divide between the park blocks and those to the east is striking: a walk from the No. 6 train winds under an often-deserted Park Avenue viaduct and through the Carver Houses before arriving at Fifth Avenue.
Nonetheless, sales at 1212 have been surprisingly brisk, said Harold A. Fetner, the chief executive at Durst Fetner Residential, especially for ''the dead of summer,'' given that the target customers are ''the Hamptons, Martha's Vineyard, Nantuckety, just-out-of-the-city market'' that tends to buy more in the spring and fall. Just a few weeks after the sales office opened, six apartments are in contract or on the verge, he said.
Part of the building's appeal lies in its renovation. The developers kept the prewar feel of the residences, including restoring the 90-year-old neo-Baroque ceiling in the lobby, festooned with rosette medallions. And then there is the fact that the prices are well below what they would be farther south, hovering around $1,500 per square foot, with a nearly 2,400-square-foot three-bedroom apartment on a middle floor priced at $3.41 million, and an 1,800-square-foot three-bedroom at $2.66 million.
At 1200 Fifth, after its conversion to condominiums, a penthouse apartment sold for $15 million in 2009 to a client who could have lived anywhere, said Pamela Liebman, chief executive of the Corcoran Group, which was involved in marketing the building.

HEADLINE: New Grist for a Visual Chronicle of Stock Traders' Agony

BYLINE: By PETER LATTMAN

 BODY:
The tumult in the stock market has been a boon for The Brokers With Hands on Their Faces Blog.
With traders around the world gesticulating in agony as the financial indexes swoon, a Web site is documenting the suffering.
The Brokers With Hands on Their Faces Blog is exactly what it sounds like and nothing more: a blog that posts photographs of market players putting their hands on their faces.
''I guess that in a morbid way the site has suddenly come back into fashion,'' said Matthew R. Robison, the blog's creator. On Friday, the day after the market dropped 500 points, Mr. Robison said the blog's traffic reached a record of nearly 50,000 visitors. 
Mr. Robison, 28, started the site in October 2008 during the depths of the financial crisis. Back then he was living in Brooklyn and working as a production assistant at Palgrave Macmillan, the academic publisher. Pictures of pained traders were popping up everywhere, and Mr. Robison thought they were funny.
He put together a collage of about 10 of them and sent it around the office. His friends laughed. He posted them on a site he created on Tumblr, a blogging platform with a visual focus. It went viral.
''I was cavalier about the financial crisis back then because I had so little money,'' he said. ''In the beginning it was pure schadenfreude, because for middle-class people like me it's kind of funny to laugh at stock brokers.''
Mr. Robison's blog is one of a group of Web sites that over the last decade has taken pleasure in Wall Street's misfortunes. During the housing crisis, the Mortgage Lender Implode-O-Meter gained a large following by tracking the lenders that had run into trouble. And in the dot-com bust, a Web site with an obscene name became popular as it catalogued technology companies as they collapsed.
Mr. Robison took a more visual approach to documenting stock market swoons. Through the spring of 2009, he had published about 100 different images. His blog contains no words, only pictures. One guy rubs his eyes in disbelief. Another covers his mouth in surprise. Yet another scratches his head in confusion. (Sad Guys on Trading Floors, an unrelated site, has a similar format but includes captions and is not limited to traders and their hands.)
As the market began its postfinancial crisis rally in 2009 - and brokers presumably stopped putting their hands on their faces - the site went dormant. Mr. Robison also moved on in his personal life, leaving New York to follow his girlfriend to Madison, Wis. But last Thursday during the market downturn, Mr. Robison said he received a few dozen e-mails from readers all over the country. One reader, who Mr. Robison said worked for the Web site of a major news network, sent him a few new photos of traders in anguish.
''So I started things up again, partly out of boredom, but I was also following the debt crisis and felt like I wanted to comment in some way,'' he said.
Mr. Robison says he thinks that people have responded to the site for a variety of reasons.
''With these photos there are a number of layers to laugh at - the poor broker, the photographer waiting to take that perfect photo of the poor broker, the media who love to run with these photos,'' he said. ''And then there's me, this guy who collected them and made a blog, which is totally ridiculous as well. People can laugh at whichever part they want to laugh at or maybe they're not laughing at all. Maybe they think it's beautiful, or horrible, or stupid. All of them are probably right.''
As for himself, Mr. Robison, who grew up in Lake Elsinore, Calif., said that as Wall Street's problems spilled over onto Main Street - and into his own life - he had stopped finding the humor in market declines.
A bank foreclosed on his parents' home last year. Budget cuts have gutted the public school where his mother teaches. And while Mr. Robison is freelancing for a number of publications, including the popular Web site The Morning News, he says he cannot find steady work in Madison.
''I don't think it's funny anymore,'' he said. ''Now it's kind of sad because I just want the economy to recover.''
But he said he would continue to publish photos of brokers with hands on their faces.
''I think I'll keep posting them until I get a job.''
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: U.S. Debt Rating, Brought Down a Notch

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re ''S.&P. Downgrades Debt Rating of U.S. for the First Time'' (front page, Aug. 6):
How could any credit rating agency watch the ideological fanaticism and debt-limit hostage taking of the Tea Party Republicans in the House of Representatives and not downgrade its confidence in the ability of the United States government to address our nation's economic needs effectively?
My confidence in Standard & Poor's has returned, while my confidence in President Obama's ability to mobilize our nation against the Tea Party radicals has been shaken. 
ALLEN HERSHKOWITZ Waccabuc, N.Y., Aug. 6, 2011
To the Editor:
Is this not the same rating agency that gave AAA ratings to the junk mortgage-backed securities that Wall Street peddled to investors, leading to the collapse of the housing market? The hubris of S.&P. is galling, but perhaps more appalling is the failure to hold it responsible for its actions.
S.&P. and Moody's are charged with the enormous obligation to be the unbiased arbiters of risk, and on this central duty they have failed miserably. Why anyone should value their opinions is beyond me.
PETER J. BUGGELN Boca Raton, Fla., Aug. 6, 2011
To the Editor:
Thanks, Republicans, for impairing the creditworthiness of United States securities. S.&P. lost confidence in the ''effectiveness, stability and predictability'' of American political institutions because the Teapartistas showed that they were willing to cause our government to default on payment of Treasury bonds if they did not achieve their political goals -- weakening the social safety net and protecting the rich from paying even one dollar more in taxes.
Thanks to the party of fiscal irresponsibility, United States bonds have now become riskier securities.
MITCHELL ZIMMERMAN Palo Alto, Calif., Aug. 6, 2011
To the Editor:
The S.&P. debt rating cut is certainly not good news for the United States, as it reflects a dim view of our economy by a respected analyst. However, in general, ratings for bonds and other securities mainly reflect default probabilities, and some research, including my own, shows that S.&P. may systematically err in its assessments. Moreover, the United States, technically, never has to default on its debt.
There is a fundamental difference in that respect between, say, Greece and the United States. Our external debt, as well as all our domestic obligations, are denominated in dollars. And our government can print dollars.
Greece, on the other hand, owes euros both domestically and internationally but cannot print euros. Therefore, Greece may actually not have enough euros to pay off its obligations whereas the United States can always print more dollars.
Of course, I am not advocating wiping out our national debt with runaway inflation (which is the usual consequence of heavy printing of money). This is also not to say that we do not have a recession, a serious debt burden, high unemployment and low growth.
But it is important that we are very clear about what a downgrade means.
S. ABRAHAM RAVID New Brunswick, N.J., Aug. 6, 2011
The writer is a professor of finance and economics at Rutgers Business School.
To the Editor:
In ''After Tumultuous Week, Markets Prepare for Another: A 2nd Recession May Bite Deeper Than the First'' (Business Day, Aug. 8), you assert that a second recession could be worse because there is little room left to use fiscal policy. This argument seems to take for granted that there is some threshold value at which the size of the debt rules out fiscal policy. In fact, the United States can borrow right now at near-zero rates (adjusting for inflation), which suggests that we do have the balance sheet capacity to use fiscal stimulus.
It would be a real tragedy if we failed to prevent another economic catastrophe because of widespread misunderstanding about the nature of the public debt.

HEADLINE: Groups Advocating For the Arts Feel the Pinch

BYLINE: By ROBIN POGREBIN

 BODY:
The Alliance for the Arts, which has served New York's cultural world through research and advocacy for 35 years, is transferring its primary activities to the Municipal Art Society and to WNET, two deals in the process of being completed that illustrate how arts advocacy and service groups in New York are struggling to sustain themselves at a time of scarce resources.
The advocacy groups find themselves competing for financing against the very cultural organizations they were created to support, which in turn can no longer afford the dues required by some of the groups that advocate for them.
The Alliance of New York State Arts Organizations, for example, dissolved last year because of debt and lack of money. The New York State Alliance for Arts Education has unsuccessfully explored merging with several organizations, all of which went out of business over the last two years. 
''If it's tough times for the arts, it's even tougher for the advocates,'' said Mitchell L. Moss, a professor of urban policy at New York University. ''People want to give to the organizations that are involved in creating art. The advocacy groups are secondary.''
The Alliance for the Arts says its decision to join forces with two other organizations simply represents an evolution of its activities, an attempt to change with the times that was prompted by the resignation of its longtime president, Randall Bourscheidt, last year.
''We spent a lot of time looking at the organization's position in the community,'' said J. P. Versace Jr., the alliance's chairman. ''I've always been a fan of partnerships, because there is such limited funding.''
Founded in 1976, the alliance was among the first groups to study the arts as an industry and continues to issue reports that emphasize the importance of the arts to the economy and to education.
Over the years the alliance has operated as an industry research arm, providing the sort of intellectual heft that was useful in promoting the arts to fund-granting organizations like the City Council, at whose hearings it has often testified. An alliance study published in 2009, ''Culture Builds NY,'' for example, studied how capital construction at New York City's cultural institutions between 2003 and 2010 created jobs and other economic benefits.
The alliance also serves as a source of information on the arts and cultural events in New York, through its Web sites, nyc-arts.org, nyckidsarts.org and nystatearts.org.
Some see the move of the alliance's research operations to the Municipal Art Society and its Web operations to WNET, the public broadcaster, as an unfortunate diminution. ''It isn't enough to just rely on the individual efforts of not-for-profit arts organizations or to rely on the city or the state to do what's needed,'' said Martin E. Segal, who in 1974 founded the Cultural Assistance Center, the alliance's precursor.
But others say that advocacy groups' efforts are often redundant. ''I've never supported any of these groups, and I've never seen any reason to do so,'' said Robert W. Wilson, a former New York City Opera chairman who now serves on the Metropolitan Opera board. ''I would rather support the arts organizations themselves.''
Because the alliance's Web operations were built with city money, their transfer to WNET needs the approval of the city's Cultural Affairs Department. The agency would also need to approve the transfer of the alliance's city programming money to the arts society.
''It's a good example of an organization being thoughtful about its role and not just perpetuating itself,'' said Kate D. Levin, the cultural affairs commissioner. ''These kinds of organizations remain vital parts of the city's cultural life.''
Three of the alliance's seven employees are also moving over to the art society, including the chief financial officer.
The New York State Alliance for Arts Education considered throwing in the towel in recent years but decided against it. ''The sentiment of the board is: There is still a role to be played and a need for the services we provide,'' said Jeremy Johannesen, its executive director. ''It's just a question of adjusting the model to the economy.''
The arts education alliance's some 100 members are struggling to pay dues of $35 to $250. ''Paying membership dues to support advocacy or making payroll -- that decision doesn't even get considered,'' Mr. Johannesen said.
At the New York City Arts Coalition, which monitors the city and state cultural budgets and promotes arts awareness, membership dues range from $35 to $600, based on an organization's budget. ''Half the membership has asked if they can pay less,'' said Norma Munn, the coalition's chairwoman. ''I've never seen it this bad. The last two years have been unmitigated misery.''
In tough economic times, arts advocacy can seem like a luxury, but cultural experts say this is precisely the time when institutions need their cheering section.
''Often our board members are supporting theaters they love, so we're one step removed,'' said Virginia Louloudes, the executive director of the Alliance of Resident Theaters/New York, an advocacy organization for nonprofit theaters in the city. ''We really have to explain better what it is we do.''
That means explaining how supporting the arts doesn't just mean supporting art or artists, but the restaurants near the theaters, the hotels people stay in to see the ballet and the taxis people take to museums.
''In times like this advocacy is even more important,'' Ms. Louloudes said, ''not just to fight for the dollars, but to let people know the value arts bring to the community.''
Unlike some larger cultural institutions, many small to midsize organizations cannot afford their own lobbyists, so the advocacy groups have filled that need.
''If you're not at the table,'' said Jimmy Van Bramer, chairman of the City Council's Cultural Committee, ''your seat is going to be filled by some other advocacy group and some other issue. We need more money for day care, we need more money for libraries, we need more money for parks.''
The Alliance of Resident Theaters/New York, for example -- known as A.R.T./New York -- has been a lifeline for nearly 300 member theaters since 1972. ''They're really the voice of Off Broadway and not-for-profit theaters,'' said Todd Haimes, the artistic director of Roundabout Theater Company. ''If you're a small theater company and you don't have your garbage picked up, you call A.R.T./New York. If you don't know how to reach your council person, you call A.R.T./New York.''
The New York Foundation for the Arts, which provides unrestricted funds, professional development training and entrepreneurial skills to artists, has been urging its constituents to represent themselves. ''It's very important for them to be part of the political process and not rely on advocacy groups to advocate for them,'' said Michael L. Royce, the foundation's executive director.
But Reynold Levy, the president of Lincoln Center, said cultural groups have their hands full maintaining their core operations. ''Arts organizations can do some of this for themselves,'' he said. ''But their business is generating and producing art, their business is not generating resources for it.''

PERSON: Mark O. Hatfield 

HEADLINE: Mark O. Hatfield, a Senate Republican Known for Liberal Causes, Dies at 89

BYLINE: By ADAM CLYMER; Elizabeth A. Harris contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Mark O. Hatfield, a liberal Republican who challenged his party's positions on the Vietnam War and on a balanced-budget amendment to the Constitution during his 30 years as a senator from Oregon, died on Sunday in Portland, Ore. He was 89.
His death was confirmed by Gerry Frank, a longtime aide.
Mr. Hatfield served in the Senate from 1967 to 1997, spending eight years as the chairman of the Appropriations Committee. But he came out against the Vietnam War even earlier, while serving his second term as governor of Oregon.
At a meeting of the National Governors Association on July 28, 1965, as his colleagues rallied behind President Lyndon B. Johnson, Mr. Hatfield said, ''I cannot support the president on what he has done so far.'' He complained that Johnson's escalation of the war had American troops taking over South Vietnam's responsibility ''to win or lose.'' 
Citing ''the deaths of noncombatant men, women and children,'' he said the American bombing campaign ''merits the general condemnation of mankind.''
At the time, a few prominent Democrats, including Senator Wayne Morse, a fellow Oregonian, were opposing the war. But Mr. Hatfield was the first prominent Republican to come out against it.
By the time he reached the Senate, opposition to the war was growing. In 1970 and 1971, he worked with Senator George S. McGovern, Democrat of South Dakota, on unsuccessful efforts to set a deadline for withdrawing American troops.
Mr. Hatfield said at a Washington prayer breakfast in 1973 that it was time for repentance for the ''sin that scarred the national soul.'' President Richard M. Nixon, who was in attendance, had just signed a cease-fire that ended the combat role for American forces.
Mr. Hatfield was a strong advocate of federal spending on medical research, motivated in part by his father's Alzheimer's disease and other relatives' cancer. For his home state, he pushed for appropriations for the Oregon Health and Science University in Portland, and he backed bigger budgets for the National Institutes of Health and the creation of the institutes' Office for Rare Diseases Research. Medical research, he wrote in 2001, is one of the very few things ''the government does extremely well.''
In March 1996, he told the Senate that with the end of the cold war, ''the Russians are not coming,'' alluding to the 1960s film comedy ''The Russians Are Coming, the Russians Are Coming.'' Instead, he said, ''the greatest enemy we face today, externally, is the viruses that are coming, the viruses are coming.'' Money being spent on the military should be shifted to human needs, he argued.
After he retired from the Senate, he remained a vocal advocate of spending at the health institutes, which named a facility for him, the Mark O. Hatfield Clinical Research Center.
Mr. Hatfield was one of the most liberal Republicans in the Senate. Over his career, he averaged a 65 percent favorable rating from the liberal advocacy group Americans for Democratic Action.
Those stands often put him at odds with fellow Republicans. His most serious breach with the party's senators came in 1995, when he cast the only Republican vote against a constitutional amendment to require a balanced federal budget. His vote meant defeat for the measure, which had 66 votes, one short of the required two-thirds majority.
Mr. Hatfield had voted for a balanced-budget amendment in 1982, but changed his mind in 1986, saying that a new law requiring diminishing federal deficits had made him aware of serious problems the amendment would cause. When he cast that decisive vote in 1995, young Republican senators demanded that he be stripped of his appropriations chairmanship. But senior Republicans blocked that effort.
Norman J. Ornstein, a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, described Mr. Hatfield's manner as courtly and unpretentious, which he said appealed to Oregon voters, as did his willingness to break from Republican orthodoxy. ''Oregon has always prized a flinty independence,'' Mr. Ornstein said.
Gov. John Kitzhaber of Oregon, a Democrat, said Monday, ''Senator Hatfield's moral compass, independence and willingness to reach across the aisle are an inspiration to me and countless Oregonians.''
In 1982, Mr. Hatfield allied with Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts, to campaign for a mutual United States-Soviet freeze on nuclear weapons. ''I see all life as a part of God's creation,'' he told The Christian Science Monitor, ''and I think it's rather audacious and presumptuous of humankind to consider that it has the right to destroy creation, to destroy all life.'' But the Senate rejected the freeze in 1983 and again the next year.
Mr. Hatfield's experience in World War II focused his thinking. A Navy lieutenant, he commanded amphibious landing craft that took Marines ashore -- and carried the wounded offshore -- at the battles of Iwo Jima and Okinawa.
When the war ended, he was sent to Vietnam to ferry Chinese Nationalist troops to fight the Communists. He wrote his parents of observing ''squalor'' and people begging for food, conditions he blamed not on the Japanese, but on French colonialism.
''It has remained my conclusion that the Vietnamese people have been fighting for over 20 years for the cause of nationalism,'' he reflected on that experience in a memoir, ''Not Quite So Simple,'' published in 1968. ''They are fighting in the name of social, political and economic justice, and although we may believe their view of 'justice' to be false and devilish, it is a vision for which they are prepared to die.''
He was next sent to Japan, where, he told Sojourners Magazine in 1996: ''One month after the bomb, I walked through the streets of Hiroshima and I saw the utter devastation in every direction from nuclear power.''
Mark Odom Hatfield was born in Dallas, Ore., on July 12, 1922. He graduated from Willamette University in Salem, Ore., in 1943. He taught political science there from 1949 to 1956 and was elected to the State Legislature in 1950. He was elected secretary of state in 1956 and governor, for the first of two terms, in 1958.
Mr. Hatfield worked well with a Democratic-led Legislature, concentrating on economic development. He brought industry to the state and helped local companies, especially the timber industry, supporting its requests for increased logging. He took credit for an increase of 138,000 jobs in his eight years, while taxes remained lower than in other West Coast states.
He also took leading roles in passing two state civil rights laws. At Willamette, he had had the task of driving the singers Paul Robeson and Marian Anderson to Portland after performances because Salem hotels would not admit blacks. As a legislator in 1953, he managed the passage of a public-accommodations bill to bar such discrimination. As governor, he backed a fair housing law.
He is survived by his wife, the former Antoinette Kuzmanich, whom he married on July 8, 1958; two sons, Mark O. Hatfield Jr. of Sunny Isles Beach, Fla., and Charles Hatfield (known as Visko) of Bantam, Conn.; two daughters, Dr. Elizabeth Hatfield Keller of Portland, Ore., and Theresa Hatfield Cooney of Potomac, Md.; and seven grandchildren.
One blemish on his Senate career came in 1992, when the Senate Ethics Committee rebuked him for failing to disclose gifts from a former university president who had sought his support for a government grant. But the committee found that there had been no ''quid pro quo'' and said his handling of the grant requests, from the University of South Carolina, had been routine.
Mr. Hatfield, a prominent Baptist layman, frequently spoke before church groups, and his liberal positions were often criticized by religious conservatives. But in the Sojourners interview, he said he was not concerned about the movement's influence on the Republican Party, calling it an ''embarrassment.''
Instead, he said, ''what I'm really concerned about is the impact it's having on the cause of Christ -- that somehow I'm going to come into a relationship with Christ by agreeing to their political agenda. That is not the key to salvation from the biblical teaching.''
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.
Online Correction: August 8, 2011, Monday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An earlier version misstated the name of a university that benefited from Mr. Hatfield's support. It is Oregon Health and Science University, not Oregon Sciences and Health University.

HEADLINE: Standard & Poor's Lowers More Ratings

BYLINE: By ERIC DASH; Mary Williams Walsh and Michael Cooper contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Even after Standard & Poor's stripped the United States of its top credit rating on Friday evening, the downgrades were not over.
On Monday, S.& P. lowered its ratings of some of the nation's most important financial institutions, from mortgage giants like the Federal National Mortgage Association to major trading clearinghouses that rely heavily on the government for support. The ratings dropped to AA+ from AAA, in lockstep with its long-term rating for the United States.
S.& P. also dropped the top credit rating of five large insurers, while several states and hundreds of municipalities with strong federal ties braced for similar actions. Late Monday night, however, S.& P. said it would allow some states and cities to keep ratings higher than America's sovereign debt. 
Although the broader stock market fell nearly 7 percent on Monday, the bond market largely appeared to shrug off S.& P.'s later downgrades. Most of the companies affected, in fact, saw only modest increases to their borrowing costs or changes to their operations.
S.& P. had signaled in mid-July that a lower credit rating for the United States could spill over to other government and financial borrowers. That meant much of the expected increase in financing costs had already been priced into the market. And investors actually flocked to the safety of Treasury securities, causing government bond yields to plummet.
One barometer of the relative calm? Even though the overnight borrowing rate for loans backed by government securities rose on Monday, it was still about one-third of where it was a week ago, before the debt ceiling agreement was reached.
''The move by S.& P. is just not that big of a deal,'' said Alex Roever, the head of short-term fixed income for JPMorgan Chase. Investors were instead focused on the dismal economy.
The downgrade announcements started shortly after the American markets opened on Monday. S.& P. announced it would lower the credit rating of the Options Clearing Corporation, Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation as well as two of its affiliates to AA+. The clearinghouses ensure the integrity of trading between parties, acting to minimize risk for billions of dollars worth of stock, bond and derivative transactions each day. But ultimately, the government stands behind the major clearinghouses, so S.& P.'s decision to lower its federal rating forced it to downgrade them as well.
Treasury securities are routinely used as trading collateral, and some market analysts projected chaos if the downgrade prompted the clearinghouses to demand additional securities to adjust for the heightened risk. The clearinghouses maintained they would not. So far, that has meant that the rating actions have been of little consequence.
''We don't expect any changes in our operations,'' Donald S. Donahue, the chief executive of Depository Trust and Clearing, said in an interview. ''We are the company we were yesterday.''
S.& P. moved on to similarly downgrade Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac because of their ''direct reliance on the U.S. government'' in financing their operations. Investors largely anticipated that action; after all, federal officials seized control of the two mortgage giants in fall 2008.
Still, there were some signs that the mortgage giants worried that the downgrade might cause their borrowing costs to rise. Even as Treasury bond yields plummeted, the rates that Fannie Mae agreed to pay lenders for a new mortgage shot up by 0.15 percentage points, to around 4 percent on Monday morning, according to market participants. Those costs typically get passed on to consumers in the form of higher mortgage rates.
S.& P. cut other ratings, too. For example, 10 of the 12 Federal Home Loan Banks, government-affiliated enterprises that are an important source of financing to lenders, had their ratings fall to AA+; the remaining two were already at that level. It knocked down the top ratings of 70 investment funds that have ''significant exposure'' to government securities, from exchange-traded funds sold by BlackRock to a government pool run by the City of Anaheim. Even $6 billion of Israeli bonds, which were guaranteed by the United States, had their top ratings cut.
The five insurance groups were New York Life; Northwestern Mutual; Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association of America; United Services Automobile Association, which sells insurance to military families; and the Knights of Columbus, a nonprofit benevolent society that caters to Catholic families. All said they believed they were downgraded solely because of an S.& P. rule that no insurer can have a higher rating than the sovereign debt of its home country.
Ratings are important marketing tools in the insurance industry, where companies are so complex that consumers have little way of knowing which company is likeliest to honor a long-term promise. Some brokers will not sell policies from companies whose ratings fall too far.
For now, S.& P. has said that American corporate borrowers with AAA credit are safe; their ratings are largely contingent on their own debt and the broader economy. It also affirmed the ratings of bank stocks, although that did little to prevent the pounding they took on Monday.
Meanwhile, several states and cities that have top-flight credit ratings were preparing for the possibility that S.& P. might downgrade them. On top of that, the plunging stock market may translate into lower tax collections, which could mean state and local budget estimates are too rosy. ''There should be a lot of downgrades, and a lot of downgrades is bad for investor sentiment,'' said Matt Fabian, research director for Municipal Market Advisors.

The promoters of the Music to Know Festival on Long Island had a magic number in mind last week: 5,500. That was how many tickets they would have to sell to break even on this two-day event in East Hampton. 
They never got there, a spokeswoman for the festival said. By Saturday, six days before the event was to start on a used runway at the town airport, the organizers had sold only 2,500 tickets. Facing a certain loss, they canceled the festival before the trucks carrying the stage even arrived at the site.
''Unfortunately, the ticket buyers weren't there,'' the spokeswoman, Michelle Fox, said on Monday. ''You have to make a choice.''
Music to Know joins a long list of New York City-area festivals that have flamed out before the first power chord sounded, or died after a couple years of disappointing ticket sales. Festival promoters face tough going in this region: labor costs are high, the permit process is difficult, and competition with the city's rich cultural calendar is fierce. In addition, there are few large sites near the city with access to mass transit or enough camping for thousands of music fans.
The promoters of Music to Know -- Chris Jones, a Montauk hotelier, and Bill Collage, a screenwriter -- faced an additional hurdle. Escape to New York, a second small-scale rock festival aimed at a similar clientele, was slated to take place a week earlier, just a few miles away from East Hampton on the Shinnecock Indian reservation.
That festival was not turning away people at the gate last weekend, either, and the organizers resorted to offering discounted tickets and free passes in the final hours before the curtain went up. The promoter, Fred Fellowes, who also does the successful Secret Garden Party events in England, had planned to bring in about 5,000 people a day for the event.
Pam Workman, a spokeswoman for Mr. Fellowes, said about 3,000 people attended the first night, when Patti Smith was the main attraction, and roughly 5,000 came out the second night, when Edward Sharpe and the Magnetic Zeros headed the show. Tribal leaders canceled the third day because of inclement weather.
Ms. Fox said it was likely that the competition with Escape to New York had hurt the Music to Know festival, along with the spluttering economy.
Mr. Jones, who is an experienced developer and hotel owner but a newcomer to concert promotion, had set out to sell 9,500 weekend passes, at a relatively high cost of $195. For that price, he had promised high-quality food, a children's tent and more than 30 booths selling designer fashions.
He had also assembled a strong list of indie bands, who have little trouble selling out New York City sites. The headliners were Vampire Weekend and Bright Eyes.
''Maybe if Paul Simon was playing, they would have sold 10,000 tickets, but the idea was to bring something new into the community,'' Ms. Fox said.

HEADLINE: In Brooklyn, Celebrating 75 Years of a Cool Treat

BYLINE: By JAMES BARRON

 BODY:
Picture a Monday in August: A bad day on Wall Street. Spain in the headlines again. More hot, dry weather in this country. The mayor was complaining that New York was not getting the federal money it should.
It was a Monday 75 years ago, the day on which Mayor Fiorello H. La Guardia opened the city pool in Red Hook, Brooklyn, the 11th Depression-era pool built by the parks department with money from the federal Works Progress Administration.
That opening was celebrated on Monday by Adrian Benepe, the parks commissioner, and other officials, including the Brooklyn borough president, Marty Markowitz. The crowd was smaller this time around; at most a few hundred were on hand. In 1936, the turnout was 40,000. But as stopwatches clicked and relay races began, some on the sidelines reflected on the economic ups and downs of then and now. 
''It's similar, dire, economic straits,'' said James Martin, an artist from Red Hook who swims at the pool five days a week. ''It seems like it's out of our hands now - it's all special interests and lobbyists now, and we're doing well not to close down, not to cut. It's almost like our expectations have become so much lower.''
Onorio Mercado, 54, a bus driver from the Bronx, said he was worried about the future, in part because the economy ''might even get worse'' before it got better, in part because the country seemed ''more united'' 75 years ago.
''When I retire,'' he said, ''all the benefits people had years ago, I might not have. With all the problems with Wall Street, 401(k)s are going down. The problems are so wide. It's not just the city. But this country has been around a long time. We'll crawl out of it.''
Hannah Borgeson of Manhattan sounded more upbeat. ''I don't think we're in a great depression,'' she said, ''but I agree when they say it's a great resource to have these pools. I feel like our government is putting less resources into programs than in the Depression.''
Mr. Benepe said he was still optimistic, in part because the city was in ''the biggest period of investment in parks and infrastructure'' since the Depression.
''But we're investing city money,'' he said. ''They'' - the officials who built the pools and other parks projects in the 1930s - ''also had federal money.''
Mr. Benepe said the pools were models of engineering and design. ''They made them safe, and they made them clean,'' he said.
''You should see the filtration system,'' he added. ''It looks like the Queen Mary.'' To young swimmers standing nearby, he said, ''Anybody know what the Queen Mary is?''
Admission, now free, was 10 cents when the pool opened 75 years ago. Mayor La Guardia told youngsters at the opening that a dime ''means a lot to your parents'' but that they could swim in the morning, when children were not charged admission.
After about an hour - there were speeches to give and listen to, and relay races to emcee - Mr. Benepe changed into a bathing suit.
He said he was no Robert Moses, referring to the parks commissioner who presided over the construction of the pools in the 1930s. Moses had been a swimmer in college and, Mr. Benepe said, often swam at events at city pools.
Mr. Benepe described himself as a ''mediocre'' swimmer.
A moment later, he said, ''I'm an O.K. swimmer.''
Then he said, ''I could probably make it across.''
But no, he said, he would not join the synchronized swimmers' demonstration.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Bank of America Back in an Abyss

BYLINE: By ANTONY CURRIE and ROBERT COLE

 BODY:
Bank of America is leading banks back into the mortgage abyss. The nation's largest financial institution by assets shed over $16 billion of market value on Monday as its shares fell 20 percent after the downgrade of the United States credit rating, and a home loan lawsuit filed by the American International Group, the insurer. Other mortgage-heavy lenders were hit, too, but none as bad as Bank of America.
The bank, led by Brian T. Moynihan, now has fingers in nearly a fifth of the country's home loan market. Another recession wouldn't just crimp earnings power. It could also lead to fresh losses on $1 trillion of problematic loans the bank owns or services -- or both. Citigroup, where troublesome mortgages account for the largest chunk of its $300 billion in unwanted assets, had its shares tumble 16 percent on Monday. Midsize lenders like SunTrust, Regions and Fifth Third weren't far behind. 
Investors have more concerns about Bank of America. The $10 billion A.I.G. lawsuit accusing the bank -- and two institutions it bought during the crisis, Countrywide and Merrill Lynch -- of ''massive fraud,'' adds to worries that its recent progress in putting its mortgage mess behind it is coming apart.
There are growing doubts about whether bondholders will accept $8.5 billion to settle other outstanding home loan claims. And Bank of America is getting more claims than expected from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, despite a seemingly comprehensive settlement in January.
Granted, the bank is in better shape than when the last crisis hit. Its capital ratios are much higher. Bank of America also now holds more than a third of its interest-earning assets in cash or liquid securities. That could help it to last almost two years before needing to raise any new debt.
But that is, at best, secondary to shareholders. They're focused on the double whammy of a lack of earnings power and the return of the mortgage black hole. Investors now estimate that Bank of America is worth $140 billion less than its breakup value. That's more than even the most pessimistic of estimates for home loan losses. But it shows just how deep the housing hole from which Mr. Moynihan needs to climb really is.
Context Counts
Equities have been clobbered by the latest leg of the global financial crisis. Most indexes have shed more than 10 percent of their value in the last few weeks. The S.& P. 500 index declined 6.7 percent on Monday alone. But falling share prices are a symptom of fears: they are not, as yet, a cause. Unleveraged investors who take a long-term view still have good reason not to panic.
It would be foolish to suggest that equity markets can be insulated from broader woes. Financial stocks have suffered from the euro zone's halting efforts to limit sovereign debt contagion and by America's mortgage troubles. Mining companies, which are a supercharged bet on global economic growth, are also unattractive.
Indeed, if banks get meaner and economic growth slows, few companies will escape. Forecasts are only just starting to acknowledge this. Analysts at Credit Suisse have cut their estimates of corporate earnings growth in the euro zone this year to 7 percent from 12 percent and the outlook for American companies to 12 percent from 14 percent. Consensus forecasts from Starmine, which point to growth of 15 percent in earnings per share in America and Europe this year, also look ripe for downgrades.
But the context is important. Unlike in 2008 -- or 1929 -- investors show few signs of being forced to sell to repay debt or meet margin calls. If that happens, equity markets would be adding to economic problems rather than, as now, being messengers of worry.
Corporate earnings are still expected to grow, and blue-chip equities are hardly highly priced. Even if earnings growth comes in at half the current expectations, the forward price-to-earnings ratio on American stocks is still less than 15. For European companies, it's a little over 12.
There is value in stocks absent from Treasuries, German bunds and British gilts. These supposedly high-quality sovereigns just get more expensive as the stampede to presumed safe havens continues. Equity markets are not immune. But the fundamentals suggest they could prove to be a valuable source of resilience.

HEADLINE: Publishing Gives Hints Of Revival, Data Show

BYLINE: By JULIE BOSMAN

 BODY:
The publishing industry has expanded in the past three years as Americans increasingly turned to e-books and juvenile and adult fiction, according to a new survey of thousands of publishers, retailers and distributors that challenges the doom and gloom that tends to dominate discussions of the industry's health.
BookStats, a comprehensive survey conducted by two major trade groups that was released early Tuesday, revealed that in 2010 publishers generated net revenue of $27.9 billion, a 5.6 percent increase over 2008. Publishers sold 2.57 billion books in all formats in 2010, a 4.1 percent increase since 2008. 
The Association of American Publishers and the Book Industry Study Group collaborated on the report and collected data from 1,963 publishers, including the six largest trade publishers. The survey encompassed five major categories of books: trade, K-12 school, higher education, professional and scholarly.
''We're seeing a resurgence, and we're seeing it across all markets -- trade, academic, professional,'' said Tina Jordan, the vice president of the Association of American Publishers. ''In each category we're seeing growth. The printed word is alive and well whether it takes a paper delivery or digital delivery.''
Higher education was especially strong, selling $4.55 billion in 2010, up 18.7 percent in three years, a trend that Ms. Jordan suggested could be traced to the expansion of two-year and community colleges and the inclination to return to school during a rough economy.
Sales of trade books grew 5.8 percent to $13.9 billion, fueled partly by e-books, the report said. Juvenile books, which include the current young-adult craze for paranormal and dystopian fiction, grew 6.6 percent over three years.
One of the strongest growth areas was adult fiction, which had a revenue increase of 8.8 percent over three years.
E-books were another bright spot, thanks to the proliferation and declining cost of e-reading devices like the Nook by Barnes & Noble and Amazon's Kindle, and the rush by publishers to digitize older books.
In 2008 e-books were 0.6 percent of the total trade market; in 2010, they were 6.4 percent. Publishers have seen especially robust e-book sales in genre fiction like romance, mystery and thrillers, as well as literary fiction. In 2010, 114 million e-books were sold, the report said.
The survey does not include sales data from 2011, a year of substantial e-book growth. In its monthly snapshots of the industry so far this year, the Association of American Publishers has also tracked some decline in print sales.
And the report's estimate of the size of the industry was significantly smaller than those in previous surveys of the book business, which were conducted by the Book Industry Study Group and released annually.
Dominique Raccah, the publisher of Sourcebooks, a midsize publisher in Naperville, Ill., worked on both surveys and said the older methodology was flawed.
''We probably overstated our estimates,'' she said. ''And today we have a better methodology and more data.''
Ms. Raccah emphasized that the newest survey incorporates data from a much larger group of publishers, in addition to distributors, wholesalers and retailers like Barnes & Noble. In its definition of what is a book, the report counted professional and scholarly journals and databases, multimedia teaching materials and mobile apps.
It also noted that publishers, many of which have expanded in recent years, are experimenting with multimedia products that go far beyond the traditional print book, she said.
''It shows that the industry as a whole is really healthy,'' Ms. Raccah said. ''That, I think, is exciting. You're seeing an industry that is transforming itself.''
The newest survey showed that sales of adult hardcover and paperback books from 2008 through 2010 were relatively flat, growing about 1 percent over three years. Sales of mass-market paperbacks declined 16 percent since 2008.
Hardcover books became a slightly smaller portion of the trade market, dropping to 37.7 percent in 2010 from 39.6 percent in 2008. Trade paperbacks also lost some market share, dipping to 37.8 percent in 2010 from 39.5 percent in 2008.
Professional publishing, which focuses on science, medicine, law, technology and the humanities, increased by 6.3 percent from 2008 through 2010, to $3.75 billion. Scholarly publishing, the smallest category in the business, had net revenue grow by 4.7 percent since 2008.

HEADLINE: Chinese Fault Beijing Over Foreign Reserves

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER

 BODY:
HONG KONG -- It is not just many Americans who are upset about the Standard & Poor's downgrade of United States debt. A lot of people in China are angry, too. But they are aiming their venom at the Chinese government.
Chinese Internet sites lit up over the weekend with criticism of Beijing's management of the country's foreign reserves -- a usually esoteric subject that had attracted little public attention. 
But the S.& P. action hit a nerve. The ambitions of the Chinese people, eager to take their part as consumers in their nation's economic success story, have in many ways been stifled by their government's fiscal and monetary policies.
China's stock market plunged Monday, as investors worried that recent events in the United States and Europe would weaken demand for Chinese exports. The Shanghai A-share stock market closed down 3.78 percent and was the third-worst performer in Asia on Monday, trailing only markets in Taiwan and South Korea.
''The United States' sovereign credit rating suffered a downgrade, why did we become the biggest victim?'' one microblogger wrote on Sina Weibo, one of the more popular sites, which had hundreds of such postings. ''China is always bowing to the United States, when will China really rise up and cast aside its constant fear of the United States' reactions!''
Many of the Internet postings were similarly nationalistic, questioning whether the government had acted in China's best interests by investing about half of the country's $3.2 trillion worth of foreign reserves in United States Treasury securities. No other country's government comes even close to such an outflow.
''On the question of U.S. debt, China's strategic decision makers are pigs, they would rather let the people's money be used by others than let the money be used by their own people,'' said one posting over the weekend. The comment soon disappeared, presumably removed by censors.
But much of the outcry seemed to be more about venting wounded pride than proposing monetary alternatives.
That may be because, whether the microblogging patriots realize it or not, few other options exist as long as China sees the need to buy tens of billions of dollars each month to keep its currency weak and protect the nation's export machine. Too few substitutes for United States Treasuries are available to absorb China's huge foreign reserves.
Still, the Chinese political establishment does not want to be perceived by the public as too accommodating of American financial policies. That may be why the state-run news media have been harshly critical of the United States' debt management woes. The attacks that started on Saturday with the state-run news agency, Xinhua, blasting America's ''addiction to debts,'' continued Sunday and Monday with critical commentaries in state-owned newspapers.
Just as notably, though, the central bank and other government agencies remained officially silent about the downgrade.
In fact, in a move that could hardly be deemed anti-American the central bank, the People's Bank of China, let its currency, the renminbi, climb 0.23 percent against the dollar Monday morning in the daily fixing of its value. The United States has long pressed Beijing to let the renminbi rise in value.
The new level, 6.4305 renminbi to the dollar, represents the largest single-day jump in the daily fixing since November.
Still, the renminbi has risen only 2.5 percent against the dollar this year. Economists in Beijing and the West are skeptical that Chinese leaders are ready to accept a sharp rise in the renminbi's value. Producing enough renminbi to buy so many dollars has put the central bank on a collision course with consumers and businesses intent on developing the domestic economy.
One policy has been the rapid expansion of China's money supply. The broad money measure known as M2 has soared in China by 64.3 percent since the start of 2009 -- far outpacing the 10.4 percent of M2 in the United States in that period.
The expanding money supply has produced rapid inflation in housing prices, and is starting to affect consumer goods and services. Prices in July were up 6.5 percent from a year earlier, the National Bureau of Statistics announced on Tuesday morning in Beijing.
The other People's Bank policy crimping the domestic economy is the requirement that state-controlled commercial banks lend ever more of their deposits to the central bank instead of to businesses. Chinese commercial banks must now deposit more than a fifth of their assets at the central bank, earning virtually no interest.
That has given the central bank a source of inexpensive financing for its hoard of foreign reserves, but it has left many small and medium-size private businesses unable to obtain loans. Commercial banks are allocating their limited supply of credit disproportionately to state-owned enterprises.
One blogger over the weekend summed up the public frustration: ''Chinese people are working so hard, day in and day out, the economic environment is so good, but people's livelihoods are not so great -- turns out it is because the government is tightening people's waist belts to lend money to the United States.''

HEADLINE: A Wave of Worry Threatens to Build on Itself

BYLINE: By MOTOKO RICH and NELSON D. SCHWARTZ

 BODY:
Employers delaying or suspending hiring. Home buyers getting cold feet. Shoppers pulling back on spending.
Hesitation is weakening the American economy, as Monday's disastrous day on Wall Street reaffirmed what many companies and ordinary Americans have been fearing for weeks: this is too tumultuous a time for businesses or households to be contemplating expansion.
Just a few months ago, analysts were predicting that the economy would grow about 4 percent this year. The forecast is now closer to half that number as a wave of pessimism sweeps the country.
''Everybody gets into this hangdog demeanor with respect to economic expectations,'' said Paul Laudicina, chairman of A. T. Kearney, a consulting firm. ''People sit on their wallets because they feel like everything is going to get worse, and things get worse because people are sitting on their wallets.'' 
There are some signs of encouragement, including retail buoyancy at high-end department stores, improved car sales and even mild construction growth. But the nerve-racking situation that has put pessimists in ascendance got its statistical impetus late last month, when the government reported that the economy had grown much more slowly than originally thought during the first half of the year.
A few days later, after a bruising fight, Congress passed a compromise bill to cut the federal debt, a move that few saw as a meaningful long-term remedy. And by last week, the stock market started its precipitous slide, which continued Monday after Standard & Poor's downgraded the federal debt late Friday night.
The chain of events has made the prospect of another recession -- a so-called double-dip -- an obsession on Wall Street, in board rooms and living rooms across the country. For many businesses, it is already suppressing hiring. In Houston, for example, Pamela Clark, vice president of a family-owned paint company, had a flurry of new orders earlier this year and began searching for an office clerk and a paint maker.
It was the first time the company, the Preservo Paint and Coatings Manufacturing Company, had considered hiring since the recession. But Ms. Clark has yet to offer anyone a job. Orders have become unpredictable as clients -- including the makers of blow dryers and bathtubs -- say they feel uncertain about the economy and what the government is doing about it.
''There is no logic to how it goes any longer,'' Ms. Clark said. ''So we're in a holding pattern to see what's going to happen with the economy.''
The watchfulness extends beyond hiring. The most recent government reports of consumer spending and factory orders show that both have been falling. The prices of commodities have also dropped in anticipation of an economic slowdown, with crude oil down 29 percent since April. Shoppers for homes are also delaying offers as anxiety grows about the stock market, real estate agents report.
Prospective buyers like Nicole Zachariae are haunting the housing market. Late last week, on the heels of a 500-point one-day drop of the Dow Jones index, Ms. Zachariae and her husband, Brian, went house-hunting. The lush green cul-de-sacs of northern New Jersey were as enticing as ever, but Ms. Zachariae was suddenly feeling more protective of her money -- and less eager to buy.
''I don't live and die by the market,'' she said, ''but this has rocked me.''
Shannon Moore, a real estate broker in Sarasota, Fla., said many people were electing to wait out the turmoil on the sidelines. ''I don't know how many tours I've given where people say, 'I'll be back in three months,' '' she said.
Some housing experts warn that further declines in home prices could help set off another recession. ''The wait-and-see attitude begets more bad economic data, and it can become a self-fulfilling prophecy,'' said Andrew D. Goldberg, market strategist for J.P. Morgan Funds, an asset manager.
The downward cycle that could be at play is known by some economists as a ''feedback loop'' -- when one piece of bad economic data has a way of making everything else worse.
When unemployment -- now at 9.1 percent -- is high, for example, companies have little incentive to pay workers more. And with sales in a slump, they do not hire. That means those people with jobs have no pay raises to spend, and those out of work, of course, have little money to spend at all. That, in turn, means sales do not go up, and companies do not hire.
Home buyers put off their purchases, too, further depressing prices and keeping the market weak for home improvements and other big purchases like washing machines. And the stock market dip means that even those with the means to spend are likely to hold back because they feel poorer.
''It is a nasty feedback loop with negative consequences for the consumer, the jobs market and for the economy,'' said Allen L. Sinai, chief global economist at the consulting firm Decision Economics.
Since employers began adding back workers in March last year, they have hired 1.75 million people, far fewer than the eight million who lost their jobs during the recession. The pace of hiring, which accelerated to an average of 178,500 a month in the first four months of this year, has slowed considerably, to less than half that in the last three months.
Although hiring picked up in July, employers added 117,000 jobs, barely enough to keep pace with normal population growth. Signs of future growth are still subdued: the Conference Board reported on Monday that its Employment Trends index had declined for the third time in four months and that employers were likely to add just 100,000 net jobs a month for the rest of the year.
Moreover, state and local governments under financial stress are likely to continue layoffs for the rest of the year.
While the risk of another recession has certainly increased in recent weeks, what many economists fear most immediately is continued wheel spinning.
''One of the worst outcomes of the great recession is a great stagnation, where you just have an economy that is hovering along,'' said Heather Boushey, senior economist at the liberal Center for American Progress. ''And because of that, there is no urgency'' among policy makers to address job creation in a fundamental way, she said.
One pocket of recent strength has been auto sales, which accelerated after a stall in the spring. In July, all of the Big Three Detroit automakers posted healthy sales increases. Jeff Schuster, executive director for global forecasting at J.D. Power and Associates, a market research firm, said he expected sales in the second half of this year to run 9 to 10 percent ahead of last year's figures.
Such resilience has prompted some car dealers to hire. Chris Meyer, general manager for the Ford and Lincoln flagship location of Heiser Automotive in Milwaukee, said he had hired three new sales people since the beginning of the year and had openings for two more.
Elsewhere, though, a hold-tight mentality pervades.
''The important thing is to get stuff out the door so we can get paid by our customers,'' said Roger J. Sustar, owner of Fredon, a maker of precision parts for the aerospace and locomotive industries based near Cleveland. Although he had no layoff plans, he said, he had no plans to hire, either.

PERSON: Gretchen Daily 

HEADLINE: An Economist for Nature Calculates the Need for More Protection

BYLINE: By JOHN MOIR

 BODY:
COTO BRUS, Costa Rica --Dawn is breaking over this remote upland region, where neat rows of coffee plants cover many of the hillsides. The rising tropical sun saturates the landscape with color, revealing islandlike remnants of native forest scattered among the coffee plantations.
But across this bucolic countryside, trouble is brewing. An invasive African insect known as the coffee berry borer is threatening the area's crops. Local farmers call the pest ''la broca'':the borer.
Despite the early hour, Gretchen Daily, a Stanford University biology professor, is already at work studying this complex ecosystem. Amid a cacophony of birdsong, Dr. Daily and her team are conducting experiments that demonstrate the vital connection between wildlife and native vegetation. Preliminary data from new studies suggest that consumption of insects like la broca by forest-dwelling birds and bats contribute significantly to coffee yields.
Since 1991, Dr. Daily, 46, has made frequent trips to this Costa Rican site to conduct one of the tropics' most comprehensive population-level studies to monitor long-term ecological change. 
''We are working to very specifically quantify in biophysical and dollar terms the value of conserving the forest and its wildlife,'' she said.
In recent years, Dr. Daily has expanded her research to include a global focus. She is one of the pioneers in the growing worldwide effort to protect the environment by quantifying the value of ''natural capital'' -- nature's goods and services that are fundamental for human life -- and factoring these benefits into the calculations of businesses and governments. Dr. Daily's work has attracted international attention and has earned her some of the world's most coveted environmental awards.
Part of Dr. Daily's interest in natural capital emerged from her research in Costa Rica, where she became intrigued with an innovative government initiative known as Payment for Environmental Services. The program, initiated in the 1990s, pays landowners to maintain native forest rather than cut it and has contributed to a significant reduction in Costa Rica's deforestation rate.
The Costa Rican program helped inspire Dr. Daily to co-found the Natural Capital Project in 2006. NatCap, as the program is known, is a venture led by Stanford University, the University of Minnesota and two of the world's largest conservation organizations, the Nature Conservancy and the World Wildlife Fund. It aims to transform traditional conservation methods by including the value of ''ecosystem services'' in business, community and government decisions. These benefits from nature -- like flood protection, crop pollination and carbon storage -- are not part of the traditional economic equation.
''Currently, there is no price for most of the ecosystem services we care about, like clean air and clean water,'' said Stephen Polasky, professor of ecological/environmental economics at the University of Minnesota. He says that because economic calculations often ignore nature, the results can lead to the destruction of the very ecosystems upon which the economy is based.
''Our economic system values land for two primary reasons,'' said Adam Davis, a partner in Ecosystem Investment Partners, a company that manages high-priority conservation properties. ''One is building on the land, and the second is taking things from the land.''
''Right now, the way a forest is worth money is by cutting it down,'' Mr. Davis said. ''We measure that value in board-feet of lumber or tons of pulp sold to a paper mill.'' What has been missing, he says, is a countervailing economic force that measures the value of leaving a forest or other ecosystem intact.
Early on, Dr. Daily recognized that new tools were needed to quantify nature's value. ''We began by developing a software program called InVEST (Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Trade-offs) to map and value nature's goods and services that are essential for humans,'' she said.
The software, which is available as a free download, enables the comparison of various environmental scenarios. What is the real cost of draining a wetland or clearing a coastline of mangroves? InVEST models the trade-offs and helps decision makers better understand the implications of their choices.
''Our dream was not to try to capture the full value of nature's services, because that's so hard to do,'' Dr. Daily said. ''Our goal is to begin making inroads in the decision-making process by including at least some of the value of nature in the economic equation.''
The Natural Capital Project now works in Latin America, Africa, Asia, the Pacific and North America. In China, NatCap is working with the government on an ambitious program to protect natural capital. After deforestation caused extensive flooding in 1998, China committed $100 billion to convert vast areas of cropland back into forest and grassland. The government is building on this success by helping to develop and test the InVEST software to put in place a new reserve network that is projected to span 25 percent of the country. The reserves will help with flood control, irrigation, drinking supply, hydropower production, biodiversity and climate stabilization.
At a NatCap site in Hawaii, Kamehameha Schools, the state's largest private landowner, used InVEST to evaluate future land use for a 26,000-acre site on the North Shore of Oahu. In the past, the landholding had been used for aquaculture, crops and habitation. After examining the alternatives modeled by InVEST, Kamehameha Schools selected a diversified mix of forestry and agriculture intended to improve water quality, sequester carbon and generate income.
About seven months ago, Google.org, the philanthropic arm of Google.com, unveiled a powerful new tool that enables global-scale monitoring and measurement of changes in the earth's environment. Called Google Earth Engine, it features a huge trove of satellite imagery of the earth's surface. NatCap is now moving the InVEST software onto the Google Earth Engine platform.
''Right now, when we do a NatCap project or use InVEST, we send people to a country or state, and they spend weeks accumulating the data and putting it in the right format,'' said Peter Kareiva, vice president and chief scientist for the Nature Conservancy. Google Earth Engine will greatly speed the analysis process, Dr. Kareiva said.
Luis Solorzano, program director of environmental science at the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation, who worked on Google Earth Engine, says that the new tool can map trends and allow scientists to forecast such things as soil fertility, erosion and deforestation. ''It's the kind of tool policy makers need to make informed decisions,'' Dr. Solorzano said.
Because the natural capital concept is anthropocentric, Dr. Daily sometimes is asked whether quantifying ecosystem services runs the risk of ignoring nature's intrinsic worth or overlooking difficult-to-measure aspects of the natural world, like aesthetic or spiritual benefits.
Dr. Daily acknowledges that certain properties of nature defy quantification. ''The beauty of the natural capital approach is it leaves the vast, immeasurable aspects of nature in their own realm while focusing in a very practical way on environmental benefits that we can and should incorporate into our current decisions.''
The precarious state of the world's environment has concerned Dr. Daily since her teenage years, when her family lived in West Germany and she witnessed the destructive power of acid rain on the country's forests. ''I realized then that I wanted to be a scientist,'' she said. This early fascination with nature led to her passion for the forests of Costa Rica, and that in turn set the course for her international leadership with natural capital.
Dr. Daily's work took on a special urgency with the 2005 publication of the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment, which was developed under the auspices of the United Nations. This report found that recent and rapid human-caused changes have produced a ''substantial and largely irreversible loss'' in the diversity of life on earth and that two-thirds of the world's ecosystem services were declining.
''The loss of earth's biodiversity is permanent,'' Dr. Daily said. ''And it is happening on our watch. We need to convey with compelling evidence the value of nature and the cost of losing it. I find it stunning that until the next asteroid hits the planet, it is humanity that is collectively deciding the future course of all known life.''

HEADLINE: Chargers Fans Fear Losing Their Team

BYLINE: By GERARD WRIGHT

 BODY:
SAN DIEGO -- Here is a view of the between-life, or afterlife, known as limbo, for a professional sports team.
The rows of once-temporary steel bleachers below and behind Kyle Spangler show growing patches of rust. Alongside his field-level seat, in the corner end zone at Qualcomm Stadium, the bleacher surface is pitted with fresh tobacco stains, as though to compare their corrosive qualities with those of time and nature.
The hasty return of N.F.L. training camps has left every fan to contemplate a merry-go-round of comings and goings and stayings. In that respect, the Chargers are no different.
Where they stand apart is their status as one of San Diego's two major sports teams, and what their fans consider a real possibility: that in the absence of an agreement by a cash-strapped city and state to replace Qualcomm Stadium, the Chargers will leave town. 
The most likely destination is a two-and-a-half-hour drive north on the San Diego and Santa Ana Freeways, to downtown Los Angeles, where the City Council is expected to vote Tuesday on starting the process of approving construction of a privately financed $1.2 billion stadium with a retractable roof.
Financed by Anschutz Entertainment Group, the sports and entertainment conglomerate owned by Philip Anschutz, the proposed stadium is the latest attempt to lure a N.F.L. franchise back to Los Angeles since the Rams and the Raiders left in 1995.
Also under consideration is a rival proposal, 20 miles southeast of downtown in the City of Industry, also privately financed, by the construction mogul Ed Roski, who worked with Anschutz in developing the downtown Staples Center.
Farther south, negotiations between San Diego and the Spanos family, which owns the Chargers, over a new stadium date to 2002, when the family appointed the lawyer Mark Fabiani as its go-between with the city.
Fabiani, who is also serving as spokesman for Lance Armstrong during a federal grand jury's doping investigation, said a new downtown stadium for the Chargers would cost $750 million to $800 million. Citing previous stadium projects, Fabiani said the public share of those costs would be about 65 percent.
The calculation for teams, politicians and voters alike will be the price that can be placed on the fanaticism of fans like Spangler, 26, who watched a night scrimmage last week in an Antonio Gates jersey.
Spangler's love affair with the Chargers -- he drove 110 miles from the Los Angeles exurb of Ontario to Qualcomm, as he does three or four times a season for games -- began with the end of another relationship when he was 9.
That was in 1995, when the Los Angeles Rams fled Southern California for a warmer welcome and newer stadium in St Louis. With that experience, he can see the future for Chargers fans in his own past.
''A lot of San Diego fans might have the same resentment that I had when the Rams left,'' Spangler said.
As with many of the fans at the practice, he says the Chargers' departure is inevitable.
''The way everything is shaping, it looks like L.A.,'' Spangler said. ''You hear a lot more about the stadium being built in L.A. than you do here.''
The Chargers' departure would not be in response to their performance on the field. With five playoff appearances in the seven years, the talent-laden Chargers have been one of the N.F.L.'s better teams in the regular season.
DeeDee Hess sat nearby with her daughter, son-in-law and granddaughter. Newly returned home after 15 years in ''the People's Republic of Santa Monica,'' she was renewing acquaintances with a place and team that had been part of her family's life from its inception.
As a security guard for the team, her father would walk the field before games during the 1970s and early 1980s. Hess trod the same turf as a volunteer usher for Radio City Music Hall performers when the stadium hosted the Super Bowl in January 2003.
Hess says ''absolutely'' that the Chargers are headed for Los Angeles, a state of affairs that will be painful for her and the team.
''This is nostalgic for me,'' she said. ''It makes me mad. Honestly, they're not going to get the support there. The Lakers are about it in L.A.''
The fans, perhaps 2,000 in all, were scattered through the lower reaches of Qualcomm's 71,500 seats. From the seats beyond the western end zone, quarterback Philip Rivers's voice could be heard as he called plays from the far 20-yard line.
The stadium was opened in August 1967, a monolith of concrete, its playing field and parking lots subject to occasional inundation from a tributary of the nearby San Diego River.
Bert and Lucy Hernandez were among those who voted on the original ballot measure for the stadium's construction, in the mid-1960s. They have been season-ticket holders for 20 years.
He was in the military, and then a salesman, now retired, with no illusions about the state of the place: he waits unto eternity to use the restrooms, the structure itself showing its age.
''They're not doing anything to renovate it,'' Bert Hernandez said of the Spanos family, ''because they don't want to invest in it.
''Right now, I think the Chargers are in limbo because I don't know if they're going to leave or stay. I guess they don't see any hope of San Diego coming through and saving them.''
Players like long snapper David Binn and center Nick Hardwick have more than the usual amount of emotional investment in the team's future whereabouts.
Both are year-round residents of the city, Hardwick for eight years, Binn since 1994.
''San Diego isn't known as a huge football town, but the fans are very passionate,'' Binn said.
Hardwick, who is also the team's players union representative, disagreed. ''A football town?'' he responded. ''Oh yeah. When we're rolling, in our stadium on a Sunday, it's one of the louder places you'll play.''
Neither player professes to know the team's likely destination, but both offer civic pride as a reason for it to stay.
''I guess I would go where I'm told to go,'' Hardwick said with a notable lack of enthusiasm about the prospect of playing in Los Angeles. ''But I like where I'm at, and I would like to stay here.
''I know a lot of the guys in the locker room would rather stay in San Diego. It's a great city to live in and play for. We're proud to be here.''
Timing appears to be critical in persuading local voters to support tax increases. A ballot initiative to allow partial public financing of a $453 million downtown baseball stadium passed easily in November 1998, less than two weeks after the Padres lost to the Yankees in the World Series.
Since then, though, the economy and government's finances have deteriorated in California. In 2008, voters rejected a proposal to pay for improvements in firefighting services and equipment through a parcel tax increase. This came 12 months after wildfires killed 15 people and destroyed 3,400 houses near San Diego in October 2007.
''The Chargers are very popular in San Diego,'' Darren Pudgil, a spokesman for Mayor Jerry Sanders, said. ''For the people of San Diego, it's going to be a decision to decide if they want to keep the team in San Diego.''
Whatever the resolution, it will not be in the near term. Pudgil said the city hoped to put a stadium financing proposition to a vote on the November 2012 ballot, a football lifetime away.

CORRECTION-DATE: August 12, 2011

 CORRECTION:
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on Tuesday about the San Diego Chargers' possible relocation to Los Angeles misstated the name of the section of Interstate 5 that runs between San Diego and Los Angeles. Going north from San Diego, the section is known as the San Diego Freeway, and becomes the Santa Ana Freeway in Orange County; it is not the Golden State Freeway, which begins in Los Angeles.

HEADLINE: While The Markets Swoon ...

BYLINE: By JOE NOCERA

 BODY:
It's hard not to feel a certain contempt for Standard & Poor's in the wake of its downgrade of American debt. Its sole job as a credit-rating agency is to gauge the creditworthiness of bonds, yet like its competitors, Moody's and Fitch, it has consistently fallen short. It downgraded Enron days before the company went bankrupt. Its willingness to slap a AAA rating on securitized subprime junk was the foundation upon which the entire financial crisis was built. And now, to show that it's got some spine, S.& P. decided to downgrade the United States? From a purely economic standpoint, the likelihood of a U.S. default is nil. As my friend Daniel Alpert, a founding managing partner of Westwood Capital, put it: ''The size of the U.S. economy, the wealth of its inhabitants and the assets of the sovereign entity itself are unquestionably more than adequate to repay, with interest, all of the $14 trillion or so of the nation's debt.'' He added, ''Anyone with a rudimentary understanding of finance and economics can figure that out.'' On Monday, with the market collapsing, where did investors rush to put their money? In the one security they still considered safe: U.S. Treasuries. 
On the other hand, I also found myself nodding in agreement as I read S.& P.'s analysis. The downgrade, after all, was less about economics than politics. S.& P. was frightened by the same thing that has scared most Americans: the spectacle of an unyielding minority of Tea Party Republicans ready to push the country into default rather than accept even modest tax increases to help bring down the deficit. ''The effectiveness, stability, and predictability of American policy-making and political institutions have weakened at a time of ongoing fiscal and economic challenges,'' wrote S.& P. in its downgrade report. Who can disagree?
Has any president in American history left behind as much lasting damage as George W. Bush? In addition to two unfinished wars, he also set us on the path to our current financial mess. The Bush tax cuts, which turned a surplus into a growing deficit, have been disastrous. As James Fallows pointed out in a prescient 2005 article in The Atlantic predicting a meltdown, they reduced tax revenue ''to its lowest level as a share of the economy in the modern era.'' (In its downgrade report, S.& P. suggested that it did not believe that Congress would let the cuts expire at the end of 2012, as they're supposed to.) Then, in 2003, Bush pushed through prescription drug coverage for Medicare recipients. David M. Walker, then the comptroller general, described 2003 as ''the most reckless fiscal year in the history of the Republic,'' adding some $13 trillion in future entitlement costs.
When did President Obama become such a lousy speech-maker? His remarks on Monday afternoon, aimed at calming the markets, were flat and uninspired -- as they have consistently been throughout the debt ceiling crisis. ''No matter what some agency may say,'' he said, ''we've always been and always will be a triple-A country.'' Is that really the best he could do? The markets, realizing he had little or nothing to offer, continued their swoon. What is particularly frustrating is that the president seems to have so little to say on the subject of job creation, which should be his most pressing concern. On Monday, Obama mentioned a payroll tax holiday and the extension of unemployment benefits. Both moves would help people in need; neither will do much to create new jobs. I know that there are limits to what any government can do to create jobs. But what one yearns for is a little imagination from this White House. Someone suggested to me recently that the government could create a $50 billion fund for small business, and use it to pay, say, 20 percent of the wages of new hires for two years -- first come, first served. Why doesn't Obama suggest something like that?
In the end, a downgrade from a ratings agency shouldn't keep anyone up at night; it's a sideshow. What should cause some sleepless nights is the never-ending turmoil in Europe. I keep thinking about the moment in 1931 when the failure of an Austrian bank led to a contagion of bank runs, first in Europe and then in the United States, and helped bring about the Depression. Could Europe's current debt contagion jump the Atlantic again? The possibility strikes me as painfully plausible.
I keep waiting for one wealthy, well-known figure to stand up and say publicly that he or she is willing to pay more in taxes as part of the shared sacrifice necessary to gain control of the country's deficit. I know there are wealthy people who've had that thought -- not just liberals like Warren Buffett, but old-fashioned, rock-ribbed Republicans who are worried about the country's debt problems. I even have a pretty good idea who some of them are. Come on, folks. Your country needs to hear from you.

HEADLINE: Their Stock Portfolios May Be Bleeding, but Consumers Get a Break on Gas Prices

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS; Stephanie Clifford contributed reporting from New York, and Nick Bunkley from Detroit.

 BODY:
HOUSTON -- The growing gloom about the economy has pushed down oil and gasoline prices, along with the prices of an array of other commodities. And while that could mean more spending power for consumers, perhaps tempering any possible downturn, the steep drop in energy prices reflects worries that economic activity is headed in the wrong direction.
Since April, the price of the American benchmark crude oil has fallen by roughly $30 a barrel, with more than half the drop occurring in just the last two weeks. On Monday, oil closed at $81.31 a barrel, down more than 6 percent. The decline in recent months is the most rapid in nearly three years, when oil and gasoline prices collapsed in response to the financial crisis. 
As a result, drivers could see a gallon of regular gasoline selling for a national average of as little as $3.25 next month, a drop of more than 40 cents from current levels, according to economists.
While that will be helpful for many consumers, who recently were paying $4 a gallon in some states, the decline is a byproduct of ''a pretty sick economy,'' said Allen L. Sinai, chief global economist for Decision Economics, a consulting firm.
''Crude oil futures are economically sensitive, so the picture for us and the world economy is bleak,'' Mr. Sinai said.
Still, lower oil and gas prices do provide a modest economic lift. Some economists compare them to a tax cut since they put extra dollars in people's pockets, offsetting a bit of the pain caused by a weak job market, soft home prices and evaporating investment portfolios. Falling fuel costs are especially good news for lower-income families, particularly in rural areas where people drive long distances.
The average household consumes 1,200 gallons of gasoline a year, which translates into a $120 annual savings for every dime shaved off the price of gas, according to Fred Rozell, director of retail pricing at the Oil Price Information Service.
''Everybody is helped when gasoline prices come down,'' said Michael P. Niemira, chief economist for the International Council of Shopping Centers.
The rule of thumb of many economists is that every $10 drop in the price of a barrel of oil increases economic growth by 0.2 to 0.3 percentage point, although in the event of a broad economic slowdown, that increase is likely to be offset by other factors, such as cutbacks in consumer spending and business investment, economists say.
Lower energy prices bring down expenses for some businesses that are heavily dependent on oil, like airlines, freight delivery services and makers of plastics and fertilizers.
Michael C. Lynch, president of Strategic Energy and Economic Research, a consulting firm, estimated that the drop in oil prices over the last couple of weeks alone could translate into yearly savings of $13.5 billion for commercial truck fleets, $5 billion in savings for small trucks and local delivery fleets, $5 billion for domestic airlines and $1.4 billion for railroads.
Over all, the decline in oil prices since the spring, if it persists, could save the United States economy as much as $270 million a day in transportation costs, or almost $100 billion a year, according to researchers at the Oil Price Information Service.
Retailers like Wal-Mart and the dollar-store chains should particularly benefit, since they rely on customers whose ability to spend is tied to how much money is left after filling up their tanks.
''You'll find a very, very significant correlation between the two,'' William S. Simon, who oversees Wal-Mart's United States business, said recently. ''One goes up, the other goes down. One goes down, the other goes up.''
Auto executives say consumers will be more likely to buy larger vehicles when gas prices are lower, and prices on smaller cars could go down slightly.
Few consumers seem to be celebrating yet. Shoppers interviewed at a grocery store in downtown Houston on Thursday night, after the Dow fell more than 500 points, said they were more worried about their jobs and stock prices than the cost of a gallon of gas.
Ericka Schiche, a 40-year-old real estate agent, said: ''If prices go down and stay down for a long time, it matters. But they're saying there is going to be another recession, and the new recession may be longer than the last one.''
But for those looking for a silver lining to the cloudy outlook, lower gas and oil prices offer the prospects of some, albeit limited, relief.
''This will make it easier for the Federal Reserve to stay easier on rates and perhaps increase the size of its balance sheet -- that is, to print more money'' by buying assets, Mr. Sinai said. ''Lower oil prices are an automatic response to the prospect of worse times, and in turn set up a counterforce against the possibility of recession.''

 BODY:
THE Treasury can cry foul all it wants, but the decision by Standard & Poor's to downgrade America's credit rating by one notch last Friday, and the subsequent plunge in the stock market, are serious symptoms of a loss of confidence -- an assessment that is fundamentally political, not economic.
There is little question about the technical ability of America to make good on its debts -- but there are grave questions about the political system's ability to resolve our nation's financial problems. 
The debt-ceiling deal between President Obama and Congressional Republicans merely staved off a crisis of confidence for the moment. It does not address our immediate need to avoid falling back into recession, or our longer-term need to raise enough revenue to pay for the social spending Americans want.
Moreover, the deal sidesteps the fundamental challenge the country now faces: who will pay to fix what was broken during the past decade by irresponsible tax cuts, ruinously expensive wars, failures of regulation and the resulting housing and financial booms and busts?
In the short term, the plan cuts a bit of discretionary nondefense spending, a category that in fact has not grown particularly rapidly. This is a mistake. With unemployment at 9.1 percent, and long-term joblessness at record levels, we need more spending, not less. But the agreement all but rules out new spending to boost the economy, at a dangerous time. The chances of a double-dip recession are growing -- and a further slowdown will increase, not reduce, the budget deficit.
The longer-term spending and revenue commitments are no better. Certainly spending, in particular on Medicare and Medicaid, needs to be restrained. But the deficits cannot be reined in without tax increases, and the ''framework'' does little or nothing in this regard. The S. & P. decision to downgrade reflects, in large part, the expectation that Republicans will not allow the Bush tax cuts to expire.
The recent skirmishes all dance around the central issue: the United States is in the midst of the world's largest debt crisis. The Treasury now owes the public almost $10 trillion, including $4.5 trillion to foreigners -- and that doesn't include what households and companies owe. For decades to come, Americans will face the core problem of every heavily indebted nation: who will bear the burden of adjustment?
Countries borrow for many purposes: canals and railroads in the 19th century, factories and highways in the 20th, and in the last decade, a housing and financial boom in Europe and America. When the projects don't pan out and the debtor country falls into crisis, what happens to the accumulated debts? Who pays? Creditors or debtors? Workers or investors? Rich or poor? The European Union is tearing itself apart over this question, which divides creditor nations from debtor nations and which divides groups within nations. The American variant of this conflict is just beginning.
Perhaps, some Americans believe, we can shunt the adjustment costs onto foreigners. Indeed, our creditors worry that the United States will reduce its debt burden the old-fashioned way, by inflating it away. A few years of moderate inflation, and a weaker dollar, would significantly lessen the real cost of servicing the country's debts -- at our creditors' expense.
But adjusting to the reality of America's accumulated debts will inevitably require sacrifices at home. The battle over who will be sacrificing has already begun, albeit under veils of rhetoric. The Republicans seem unconcerned about stimulating recovery, and primarily concerned that none of the long-term costs of balancing our budget be paid by upper-income taxpayers. No surprise: unemployment among the one-third of Americans with the highest incomes is barely 4 percent, while for the lowest third it is more than four times that level.
The Democrats, for their part, seem content to insist that the adjustment burden not fall on beneficiaries of government spending, whether public employees or recipients of social spending. This reflects their base in the labor movement, the public sector and the poor.
We lost the first decade of the 21st century by squandering our wealth and borrowing as if there was no tomorrow. We risk losing this decade to an incomplete recovery and economic stagnation.
An economically responsible, politically feasible distribution of the costs of working our way out of the crisis will require higher taxes, a more efficient tax code, and restrained growth of social spending, particularly Medicare. To ignore these realities, and the contentious choices they entail, is merely to postpone the inevitable day of reckoning -- and probably to make it worse.

HEADLINE: Elusive Prescriptions For an Erratic Ailment: Behind S.&P.'s Downgrade, A Committee That Acts in Private

BYLINE: By JULIE CRESWELL, LOUISE STORY and EDWARD WYATT; Julie Creswell and Louise Story reported from New York and Edward Wyatt from Washington.

 BODY:
A committee of about a half-dozen largely unknown people made a decision last Friday that has roiled Washington and Wall Street.
That committee operates deep inside Standard & Poor's, the credit rating agency that downgraded United States debt for the first time in history. Despite the great interest in the agency's decision, it has remained tight-lipped on what happened in its deliberations.
The individuals most responsible for the decision are not well known, except to finance ministers. S.& P. has declined to say whether the vote was unanimous, to identify all the members of the committee that voted for the downgrade or even say how many people are on it.
S.& P.'s downgrade of the nation's credit rating has raised questions about the company's judgment and even its role in the financial markets. It has also reinvigorated critics of the rating agencies, who have argued since the 2008 financial crisis that the power of S.& .P and other agencies -- which failed to foresee the problems with mortgage-related securities -- should be reduced. 
S.& P., for its part, has defended its decision but has stayed quiet about its internal deliberations. There is no rater of the raters.
When asked whether the company's raters were hiding behind the secretive committee, Catherine Mathis, a spokeswoman for S.& P., said, ''We do this to maintain our analytical independence in much the same way that the editorial board of The New York Times does not discuss its deliberations.'' Ms. Mathis was a spokeswoman for The Times until two years ago.
Ms. Mathis also said the company had many checks and balances and that its commercial role was separate from its analytical role.
''Our role is to call the risks as we see them and we have been communicating our views of America's debt for a very long time,'' she said.
The three people who have been associated with the decision are David Beers, the head of the company's entire sovereign ratings division; his deputy, John Chambers; and Nikola Swann, an analyst who is responsible for ratings in the United States, Canada and Bermuda.
The three men, who are based in different parts of the world, have all spent the majority of their careers at S.& P. rating countries around the world. Their days are typically filled with number-crunching, conversations with investors and foreign budget officials and debate about the conclusions of their reports.
According to people who have worked with them, they pride themselves on the independence of their ratings, and going against the grain can seem like a badge of honor.
''If you moved first and were proven to be right, as S.& P. was when it moved first on Iceland, you got a pat on the back,'' said Philip Alexander, a finance editor for The Banker who edited research and news releases for the sovereign team out of London from 2004 to 2007. ''Being the last to move or being clearly late was always a bad thing.''
Mr. Alexander worked near Mr. Beers, the head of S.& P.'s sovereign ratings, while in a close team of about a dozen people in London who played badminton together at times in a nearby court. He remembered that Mr. Beers, who worked earlier in his career at Salomon Brothers and Bankers Trust, ''liked a bit of a scrap.'' He recalled a time when he overheard Mr. Beers, now 58, on the phone with an angry bondholder defending S.& P.'s decision to upgrade Argentina in 2005. The country had defaulted and restructured its debt, causing losses among bondholders.
''From the sound of things, David relished putting him down,'' Mr. Alexander said. ''He was not going to take any nonsense from him and went through the criteria used to make the decision. He was ready to stick to his guns.''
Mr. Alexander also recalled that a few years ago, after S.& P. downgraded Italy, the finance minister at the time sent the sovereign team an e-mail thanking them, saying he had been warning his government for years that it could happen.
Ms. Mathis, the S.& P. spokeswoman, said Mr. Beers had no recollection of the Argentina call or the e-mail from the Italian minister. On the suggestion that S.& P. put a premium on being first in its ratings, she said the ratings were based on the analysts' views and not on the actions of its competitors.
Mr. Chambers, the deputy head of sovereign ratings who is based in New York, is more soft-spoken than Mr. Beers, said United States government officials who have met with him. Mr. Chambers, 55, appeared on television over the weekend defending S.& P.'s decision, and some news reports have noted that he was a swimming champion at Grinnell College and a literature major. His wife worked as a freelance art director for The New York Times in the 1990s.
Mr. Swann, 38, is based in Canada, where he worked for the government's department of finance before joining S.& P. in 2002. His name is listed first on S.& P.'s reports on the United States.
Last Friday, all three men joined Treasury officials in a phone call about the downgrade decision. After Treasury officials pointed out a disagreement they had with S.& P.'s analysis, the raters conceded the point and they said they would reconvene their private committee of ratings analysts. It is unknown outside of S.& P. what happened in that meeting, and the ratings agency is not saying.
A few hours later, the decision was final: the United States would no longer be rated AAA.
The three men and, to a degree, all their peers have since become heroes to some and traitors to others. Minutes after the downgrade, for instance, Representative Barney Frank of Massachusetts, the ranking Democrat on the House Financial Services Committee, called them incompetent. On Monday, William Gross, a co-founder of the bond house Pimco, declared that S.& P. had demonstrated ''some spine.''
The Dodd-Frank financial reform bill passed last year, named in part after Mr. Frank, included some measures to unravel some of the government's emphasis on ratings in its rules for banks, mutual funds and other financial entities. Those rules have not all been put into effect.
It is possible that the furor over S.& P.'s decision might persuade lawmakers to consider more laws to change the ratings companies or to even spur competition through start-ups. The European Union set up a new regulator this year that is already asking the agencies for more information about how they reach their conclusions. The Senate Banking Committee started gathering information about the downgrade for a possible hearing.
All three companies say they have improved their business practices since the financial crisis and that sovereign ratings of countries' debt do not work the same as ratings for corporate debt. Ms. Mathis, the S.& P. spokeswoman, pointed to a report issued last year by the International Monetary Fund as an example. The report concluded that the long-term track record of credit rating agencies on sovereign debt had been good. One chapter of the report said that all nations that had defaulted on their sovereign debt since 1975 had been placed in a noninvestment-grade category at least one year before the default.
Specifically, the report found that S.& P.'s ratings were generally more accurate and predictive for sovereign debt than for corporate debt. In addition, the research revealed that S.& P. was most often the first to move in downgrading sovereign debt. In up to one half of the cases examined, S.& P. lowered its sovereign debt credit ratings before both Moody's and Fitch.

HEADLINE: The Golden Years, Polished With Surgery

BYLINE: By ABBY ELLIN

 BODY:
At age 83, Marie Kolstad has a rich life. She works full time as a property manager and keeps an active social calendar, busying herself with 12 grandchildren and 13 great-grandchildren.
But one thing needed improvement, she decided: her figure. At her age, she said, ''your breasts go in one direction and your brain goes in another.'' So on July 22, Ms. Kolstad, a widow who lives in Orange County, Calif., underwent a three-hour breast lift with implants, which costs about $8,000.
''Physically, I'm in good health, and I just feel like, why not take advantage of it?'' said Ms. Kolstad. ''My mother lived a long time, and I'm just taking it for granted that that will happen to me. And I want my children to be proud of what I look like.''
Ms. Kolstad is one of many septuagenarians, octogenarians and even nonagenarians who are burnishing their golden years with help from the plastic surgeon. According to the American Society for Aesthetic Plastic Surgery, in 2010 there were 84,685 surgical procedures among patients age 65 and older. They included 26,635 face-lifts; 24,783 cosmetic eyelid operations; 6,469 liposuctions; 5,874 breast reductions; 3,875 forehead lifts; 3,339 breast lifts and 2,414 breast augmentations. 
Except for a brief turndown during the recession, those numbers have been rising for years now, and experts say the trend seems likely to accelerate as baby boomers begin to pass age 65. But the increase also has raised concerns about safety and the propriety of performing invasive elective surgery on older patients, who may suffer unintended physical and psychological consequences.
There are as many reasons for getting plastic surgery as there are older patients, experts say. Some people are living longer and remaining healthier, and they want their physiques to align with their psyches. Some are preening for potential mates and want their feathers to look their freshest. Some are still working or looking for jobs and want to be seen as more youthful contenders.
And some are simply sick of slackened jowls, jiggly underarms and saggy eyelids. Gilbert Meyer, a retired film producer in Boynton Beach, Fla., who gave his age only as ''over 75,'' saw Dr. Jacob Steiger, a facial plastic surgeon in Boca Raton, Fla., for an eye and neck lift last year. He spent $8,000.
''I was looking at myself in the mirror and didn't like what I was starting to see and did something about it,'' Mr. Meyer said. ''Why not look as good as you can when you can?''
Mary Graham, a 77-year-old restaurant owner in Thomasville, Ga., got a face-lift and breast implants earlier this year. ''The only time I go to the doctor is for plastic surgery,'' she said.
Ms. Graham plans to open another restaurant in Tallahassee, Fla., in the fall. ''I work seven days a week,'' she said. ''I wanted to look as young as I feel.''
Her plastic surgeon, Dr. Daniel Man of Boca Raton, Fla., who said he is seeing increasing numbers of patients over age 70, said, ''These people are healthy and want to be an active part of society.''
Any operation poses risks, but surprisingly few studies have focused on older patients and cosmetic enhancements. One report, published in the journal Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery in June, found that the hazards in people over age 65 are no greater than in the younger population.
Researchers from the Cleveland Clinic reviewed the medical records of 216 face-lift patients over the course of three years. The researchers found no significant difference in the instances of minor or major complications between one group of patients whose average age was 70 and another group whose average age was 57.6.
''We're saying it's not chronologic age that's so important, but it really is physiologic,'' said Dr. James E. Zins, the senior author of the study and chairman of the department of plastic surgery at the Cleveland Clinic.
All patients in his study were screened for such health problems as lung and heart disease, diabetes and high blood pressure, as well as use of medications, like anticoagulants, that could have complicated the operations. But not all older patients may be so thoroughly screened, , so his findings don't necessarily mean the risks are minimal in an older population.
''Is there a theoretical age upon which complications do become more likely?'' he mused. ''Does that mean that patients 70 and 75 years and over can safely undergo a face-lift with the same complication rate as young patients? We didn't have enough numbers to answer that question.''
While face-lifts can be performed under ''conscious sedation,'' other reconstructive procedures typically require general anesthesia, which may be risky for an elderly patient. Older patients may take longer to heal, and the results of plastic surgery may not last as long as in younger patients, said Dr. Michael Niccole, a plastic surgeon in Newport Beach, Calif.
Some critics questions whether the benefits are worth the risks, which may be underestimated.
''You know there are biases because of the underreporting of negative findings,'' said James Hughes, executive director of the Institute for Ethics and Emerging Technologies, a nonprofit research group in Hartford. ''The doctors have more or less financial incentives to do these procedures, and that often leads them to understate alternative kinds of treatments or medical advice.''
Harriet A. Washington, author of two books about medical ethics issues, asks how older patients can give informed consent to plastic surgery when so little is known of its risks to them, especially to those with chronic conditions like diabetes, osteoporosis and heart disease.
''It's one of those things that has crept up on us, and I think, as usual, we've embraced the technology before we've really embraced the ethical questions and dimensions,'' she said.
And while most research indicates that people benefit psychologically from cosmetic procedures, reporting improvements in their appearance and in body image, a minority experience some kind of emotional ''turbulence,'' said David Sarwer, an associate professor of psychology at the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine.
''There are truly psychological repercussions to these procedures, which often aren't covered in the informed consent process,'' he said.
And yet: Assuming a patient is healthy, meets all of the presurgical criteria and understands that there are risks, why is it people often are squeamish about seniors going under the knife?
Nancy Etcoff, an assistant clinical professor at Harvard Medical School who studies biology and social beliefs about beauty, believes the double takes arise from our culture's mixed feelings about old people actively on the prowl. ''Part of our stereotype of old people is that they are social, warm and likeable, but powerless and sexless,'' she said. ''Here we are in the age of Viagra, which is very well accepted, but suddenly the idea of older people, mostly women, wanting to be sexually attractive at that age makes us uncomfortable.
''If an older woman wants to regain eyelids or wants a breast that she doesn't have to tuck into a waistband, then why not?''
Ms. Kolstad asked herself much the same question. ''In my day, no one ever thought about breast enhancement or anything,'' she said. ''But nowadays women go out and they would never get a second look if they show their age. I find that you have to keep up your appearance physically, even if you just want a companion or someone to ask you to dinner.
''That's not going to happen if you don't have a figure that these geezers are looking for.''

HEADLINE: Stocks Resume Free Fall On Fear Over Economic And Credit Woes

BYLINE: By GRAHAM BOWLEY; Contributing reporting were Christine Hauser, Nelson D. Schwartz, Andrew Ross Sorkin, Helene Cooper and Bettina Wassener .

 BODY:
The stock market resumed its free fall Monday on mounting fears about the stalling economy and worries that the government had few options to increase growth, dual concerns that overshadowed the downgrade of long-term United States government debt.
The Dow Jones industrial average fell 634 points, or 5.6 percent, and the Standard & Poor's 500- stock index dropped 6.7 percent, the biggest retreats since December 2008 in the midst of the financial crisis, accelerating a sell-off that began a couple of weeks ago. The S.& P. 500 is now down 18 percent from its April 29 peak and is nearing official bear market territory, defined as a fall of 20 percent.
The sell-off continued Tuesday in Asia. The Nikkei 225 in Tokyo was down 3.7 percent in afternoon trading, while the Kospi in Seoul fell 6.2 percent. Shares in Australia sank 2.9 percent, and early indicators suggested that other markets worldwide would follow suit. S.& P. futures fell over 2 percent, signaling a lower open for markets in New York. 
So anxious are many investors that they poured money into Treasury securities, the debt the government sells to finance its operations. Even though the ratings agency Standard & Poor's downgraded United States debt a notch from the sterling AAA rating on Friday, judging it a slightly higher risk than before, many still deem Treasuries to be safer than just about any other investment.
Typically, a downgrade would cause investors to sell, but financial turmoil in Europe and policy gridlock in Washington overrode concerns about the downgrade. ''This is investors running from risk wherever they see it,'' said David Kelly, chief market strategist at JPMorgan Funds. ''The biggest risk we face here is recession.''
The stock sell-off picked up speed even though President Obama sought to calm markets, telling reporters that ''our problems are eminently solvable and we know what we need to do to solve them.'' But there is sharp disagreement how to solve them, as demonstrated by the fiercely partisan battle over raising the government's borrowing limit, which was resolved only through a last-minute compromise.
In the wake of the financial collapse more than two years ago, the government took various steps to invigorate the economy, pouring money into the financial system and adopting stimulus spending. Some economists say they think more stimulus spending is needed now to keep the economy from slowing further, but this seems unlikely given that many Republicans say the country can ill afford to add to the gaping budget deficit with more spending.
It was not just the stock market that was rattled. A few obscure but important parts of the credit market also showed signs of some stress. For example, the market for commercial paper, short-term loans that companies use to finance themselves, became less favorable. This was not nearly as bad as during the financial crisis but people will be keeping an eye on this to see if conditions deteriorate.
''The cause of all this was the marking down of growth expectations,'' said Barry Knapp, strategist at Barclays Capital. ''It has morphed into one giant global growth recession concern.'' The trading day opened ominously in the United States, after sharp drops of stocks in Asia and in Europe. The European Central Bank sought to calm investors by intervening aggressively in bond markets with special measures to help support financially troubled Spain and Italy, to little avail.
On the floor of the New York Stock Exchange, Doreen Mogavero, a trader for Mogavero, Lee & Company, noted that other traders had canceled vacations in anticipation of a wild day. More staff members were on duty to make sure computers were working properly as volumes surged.
The exchange processed a record 390 million orders in the first hour of trading, eclipsing the last record in May 2010. All told, 18 billion shares traded on the nation's stock market, the most active day in a year.
Many investors -- burned by the relentless decline of stocks in the months after the 2008 financial collapse -- seem inclined to sell rather than wait. ''It is the psychological impact that I am concerned about in terms of confidence on the market,'' said Ms. Mogavero.
The force of the stock market sell-off that has accelerated over the last two weeks -- the broader S.& P. 500-stock index has lost 16.8 percent since July 22 -- is creating the growing sense that the economy may be nearing a double-dip recession as everyone from consumers to businesses retrench.
The biggest declines were in bank stocks. Bank of America fell 20 percent. Citigroup fell 16 percent. Morgan Stanley dropped 14 percent. JPMorgan fell 9 percent. And Goldman Sachs fell 6 percent.
Investors feared that banks could be hit by the economic slowdown and that, with government spending constrained, lenders would be less likely to receive official support in the future should they need it, as they did during the financial crisis.
There was little positive news to calm investors. Standard & Poor's, the ratings agency that unleashed the latest uncertainty, took more action on Monday. It downgraded financing entities backed by the federal government, including Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the two housing giants at the center of the nation's mortgage market, because of the support they receive from the federal government.
The pall cast by the downgrades is now raising questions among some heavily indebted states about whether their own credit ratings could be in jeopardy. There are also signs investors are looking for the next country that could lose its AAA rating: the cost to insure French government debt widened significantly. ''There is speculation France could likely be the next target,'' said Otis Casey, a credit analyst at Markit.
The German index, the Dax, which dropped 5 percent Monday, has lost 21 percent of its value since the recent peak on May 2. That reflects investor fears that the European Central Bank's extraordinary bond buying could entangle even Germany in the euro zone's debt problems.
In the United States, the selling came from both panicked individuals and institutions.
Hank Smith, chief investment officer at Haverford Investments of Pennsylvania, which serves private and institutional investors, said he was fielding calls from clients who ''are anxious about is this a replay of 2008-2009 and do I have to go through that again?'' he said. ''But we say the fundamentals are very different. Corporate America has fortresslike balance sheets.''
All 500 stocks in the S.& P. 500 index were lower by the end of the day. The index closed down 79.92 points, or 6.66 percent, at 1,119.46. The Dow Jones closed below 11,000 for the first time this year, falling 634.76 points, or 5.55 percent, to 10,809.85.
As investors fled the stock market, and commodities like oil dropped on fears of a slowdown, they sought the safety of gold, which rose past $1,710 an ounce.
A surprising beneficiary was United States Treasuries, where, despite the downgrade of government debt, 10-year yields fell to 2.32 percent, from 2.56 percent, and the yield on the two-year Treasury note was at a record low.
Warren E. Buffett, perhaps the nation's most famous private investor, also said he thought the downgrade was unwarranted.
''If there were a quadruple A, I would give it to the U.S.,'' he said in an interview. ''We will always pay the bonds -- the only way we won't pay is if the printing press strips a gear.''

HEADLINE: The Downgrading of a Debtor Nation

BYLINE: By MENZIE D. CHINN and JEFFRY A. FRIEDEN. 
Menzie D. Chinn, a professor of public affairs and economics at the University of Wisconsin, Madison, and Jeffry A. Frieden, a professor of government at Harvard, are the authors of the forthcoming ''Lost Decades: The Making of America's Debt Crisis and the Long Recovery.''

 BODY:
THE Treasury can cry foul all it wants, but the decision by Standard & Poor's to downgrade America's credit rating by one notch last Friday, and the subsequent plunge in the stock market, are serious symptoms of a loss of confidence -- an assessment that is fundamentally political, not economic.
There is little question about the technical ability of America to make good on its debts -- but there are grave questions about the political system's ability to resolve our nation's financial problems. 
The debt-ceiling deal between President Obama and Congressional Republicans merely staved off a crisis of confidence for the moment. It does not address our immediate need to avoid falling back into recession, or our longer-term need to raise enough revenue to pay for the social spending Americans want.
Moreover, the deal sidesteps the fundamental challenge the country now faces: who will pay to fix what was broken during the past decade by irresponsible tax cuts, ruinously expensive wars, failures of regulation and the resulting housing and financial booms and busts?
In the short term, the plan cuts a bit of discretionary nondefense spending, a category that in fact has not grown particularly rapidly. This is a mistake. With unemployment at 9.1 percent, and long-term joblessness at record levels, we need more spending, not less. But the agreement all but rules out new spending to boost the economy, at a dangerous time. The chances of a double-dip recession are growing -- and a further slowdown will increase, not reduce, the budget deficit.
The longer-term spending and revenue commitments are no better. Certainly spending, in particular on Medicare and Medicaid, needs to be restrained. But the deficits cannot be reined in without tax increases, and the ''framework'' does little or nothing in this regard. The S. & P. decision to downgrade reflects, in large part, the expectation that Republicans will not allow the Bush tax cuts to expire.
The recent skirmishes all dance around the central issue: the United States is in the midst of the world's largest debt crisis. The Treasury now owes the public almost $10 trillion, including $4.5 trillion to foreigners -- and that doesn't include what households and companies owe. For decades to come, Americans will face the core problem of every heavily indebted nation: who will bear the burden of adjustment?
Countries borrow for many purposes: canals and railroads in the 19th century, factories and highways in the 20th, and in the last decade, a housing and financial boom in Europe and America. When the projects don't pan out and the debtor country falls into crisis, what happens to the accumulated debts? Who pays? Creditors or debtors? Workers or investors? Rich or poor? The European Union is tearing itself apart over this question, which divides creditor nations from debtor nations and which divides groups within nations. The American variant of this conflict is just beginning.
Perhaps, some Americans believe, we can shunt the adjustment costs onto foreigners. Indeed, our creditors worry that the United States will reduce its debt burden the old-fashioned way, by inflating it away. A few years of moderate inflation, and a weaker dollar, would significantly lessen the real cost of servicing the country's debts -- at our creditors' expense.
But adjusting to the reality of America's accumulated debts will inevitably require sacrifices at home. The battle over who will be sacrificing has already begun, albeit under veils of rhetoric. The Republicans seem unconcerned about stimulating recovery, and primarily concerned that none of the long-term costs of balancing our budget be paid by upper-income taxpayers. No surprise: unemployment among the one-third of Americans with the highest incomes is barely 4 percent, while for the lowest third it is more than four times that level.
The Democrats, for their part, seem content to insist that the adjustment burden not fall on beneficiaries of government spending, whether public employees or recipients of social spending. This reflects their base in the labor movement, the public sector and the poor.
We lost the first decade of the 21st century by squandering our wealth and borrowing as if there was no tomorrow. We risk losing this decade to an incomplete recovery and economic stagnation.
An economically responsible, politically feasible distribution of the costs of working our way out of the crisis will require higher taxes, a more efficient tax code, and restrained growth of social spending, particularly Medicare. To ignore these realities, and the contentious choices they entail, is merely to postpone the inevitable day of reckoning -- and probably to make it worse.

HEADLINE: Elusive Prescriptions For an Erratic Ailment: As Obama Counsels Calm, The Finger-Pointing Continues

BYLINE: By JENNIFER STEINHAUER and HELENE COOPER

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- If ever there was a time for contrition in this town, it might be after the events of the last few days: a deeply embarrassing downgrading of the nation's credit rating, poll numbers showing public support for Congress at record lows, topped on Monday with a bracing plunge in the stock market.
But it was not to be. Even as the Dow Jones industrial average fell 5.6 percent on the heels of a 5.75 percent drop last week, Congressional Republicans and Democrats retreated to their now-familiar positions, each accusing the other side of sparking the economic turmoil as President Obama continued to preach compromise. Even as he tried to calm an increasingly nervous country, there were few reassurances that any consensus on debt-reduction or remedies to spur the stalling economy were on the way. 
''It's not a lack of plans or policies that is the problem here,'' Mr. Obama said Monday in his first public comments on the economy since Standard & Poor's downgraded the country's credit rating last Friday. ''It's a lack of political will in Washington. It's the insistence on drawing lines in the sand, a refusal to put what's best for the country ahead of self-interest or party or ideology. And that's what we need to change.''
Mr. Obama then offered, with no modification or expansion, that he would be presenting recommendations to a Congressional committee charged with creating a deficit reduction plan, but hewed to the same central points that he had made during the debt ceiling negotiations, principally that spending cuts must be accompanied by tax increases.
Gene Sperling, the director of the National Economic Council, said: ''You've got a president who has pushed his own supporters to accept politically painful choices, today encouraging a coalition of the willing from both sides to opt for compromise on deficit reduction on entitlement and tax reform at a time where we have seen the real economic harm that comes from drawing hard and fast lines in the sand. That is exactly what a president should be doing at a moment like now.''
Congressional Republicans too, stuck to their talking points, offering up few fresh proposals. Repairing to their districts, they told voters that the reason for the downgrade of American debt and the precipitous slide in the stock market was not gridlock but a final budget deal that did not cut enough spending.
Democrats coined a new tagline -- the ''Tea Party downgrade''-- which they trotted out to anyone who would listen with the hopes that voters would blame Republicans for the nation's problems.
''This is the Tea Party downgrade because a minority of people in the House of Representatives countered even the will of many Republicans in the United States Senate who were prepared to do a bigger deal,'' said Senator John Kerry on Sunday on NBC's ''Meet the Press.''
While the tag may or may not stick, the political dynamics of the debt-ceiling vote were more complicated. Of the 60 members of the House Tea Party caucus, 32 voted in favor of the final debt deal and 28 voted against it.
The buttressing of positions by both parties does not bode well for the committee -- to be made up of half Democrats and half Republicans -- that is charged with coming up with a budget-cutting deal before the end of the year. In fact, the events of the last few days -- and the criticism by S.& P. of a toxic political culture in Washington -- has only heightened the divide between the two parties, according to both Democratic and Republican members.
''Over the next several months,'' Representative Eric Cantor, of Virginia, the House majority leader, said in a letter to his conference Monday, ''there will be tremendous pressure on Congress to prove that S.& P.'s analysis of the inability of the political parties to bridge our differences is wrong.''
''In short, there will be pressure to compromise on tax increases. We will be told that there is no other way forward. I respectfully disagree.''
In Houston on Monday, the House minority leader, Nancy Pelosi, of California, vowed, according to television reports, to fight to protect Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security from Republican spending cuts. Mrs. Pelosi spoke of additions to the entitlement programs that were signed by President Lyndon Johnson, adding: ''With the stroke of a law that they hope to pass, there are those who would repeal, would eliminate, those securities.''
Senior White House officials hope that the threat of up to $1.2 trillion in spending cuts that would be automatically imposed, including on defense and entitlement programs, would spur the committee to reach an agreement.
Mr. Obama's appearance reflected an effort by the White House to project leadership in a crisis while at the same time seeking to calm growing fears that the downgrade could be the beginning of worse things to come, and that the economy could slip back into recession.
Talking for 10 minutes before reporters while the market continued to slide, the president tried to project optimism that the nation's problems could be resolved.
''Markets will rise and fall, but this is the United States of America,'' Mr. Obama said. ''No matter what some agency may say, we've always been and will always be a triple A country.''
Administration officials did not say what Mr. Obama's s debt-reduction proposals might be, though he mentioned raising taxes on the rich and cuts in entitlement programs. He has not put a formal plan on the table. Many of his Democratic advisers have been prodding Mr. Obama to offer a proposal to the special committee. On the economy, Mr. Obama offered only a short list of remedies. Spending for stimulus programs, though, is off the table, given adamant opposition to such programs by Congressional Republicans as well as some Democrats.
Mr. Obama did call for an extension of the payroll tax cut ''as soon as possible,'' a slight speeding up of the end-of-the-year timetable which the administration had been seeking. And he called for an extension of unemployment insurance for those who are out of work.

CORRECTION-DATE: August 10, 2011

 CORRECTION:
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on Tuesday about the positions of President Obama and Congressional leaders on the recent financial turmoil misstated the amount of mandatory, across-the-board spending cuts called for in the new compromise budget law if Congress does not enact another round of deficit reduction by the end of the year. The automatic cuts, in defense and domestic discretionary programs, could be up to $1.2 trillion, not $1.5 trillion. And a picture caption with the article misidentified, in some copies, the White House room in which President Obama delivered his first comments on the economy after a downgrade of the nation's credit rating. It was the State Dining Room, not the East Room.

HEADLINE: Disaster Movie Gets a Sequel, With Subtitles

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSS SORKIN

 BODY:
It is beginning to feel a lot like 2008 all over again. But it's not the same.
As markets tumble - the Dow Jones industrial average fell 5.6 percent on Monday - it is instructive to hear from someone who knows a thing or two about a financial crisis: Henry M. Paulson Jr., the former Treasury secretary.
And he turns out to be more sanguine about the United States, after the Standard & Poor's downgrade, than some other voices being heard amid the tumult.
''While the players in Washington certainly haven't performed at AAA level, I would certainly take U.S. Treasuries over other AAA sovereigns any day,'' Mr. Paulson told me. 
Yes, there has been much hue and cry over S.&P.'s cut in the credit rating of the United States. But the credit rating downgrade almost seems like a bad joke considering what happened in the bond market: Treasuries rallied as yields fell on Monday to their lowest levels since 2009. In other words, investors felt Treasuries were a safer - yes, safer - bet after S.&P. downgraded them than they were before. (What does that say about S.& P.'s credibility in the bond market?)
The downgrade may point up the enormous challenges facing the country - persistent unemployment and the possibility of slower economic growth is a hard truth that may ultimately force the cost of borrowing to rise for the nation over the long term.
But the downgrade is almost a sideshow compared with the real reason that stocks started falling Monday morning, before panic set in and the momentum of the market took over: the intractable problems in the European Union, which look a lot more like the United States banking crisis circa 2008 than what's happening on this side of the Atlantic now.
Pretend for a moment that countries like Greece, Spain and Italy are our banks in 2008. They are close to insolvent. (And the actual banks in Germany, Britain and France that are supposed to be strong are horribly undercapitalized and are holding too much debt from countries like Greece, Spain and Italy - all countries that truly may not be able to pay it back in full.)
As Mr. Paulson told me, ''The most pressing and significant problems in the global economy are unsustainable structural issues with regard to the E.U. - fiscal deficits and the structure of the E.U. itself.''
This story might not grab as much attention, but it is this plight that is manifesting itself in the market.
The problem is that without any one individual in charge in Europe, there is virtually no possibility for someone to emerge the way that Mr. Paulson did during the panic of 2008 with a lifeline like the Troubled Asset Relief Program, a plan he practically had to ram down the throat of Congress. (And there's no money for such a program unless a coalition is formed.)
Say what you want about TARP - it was clearly unpopular - but in retrospect, it is hard to argue that it did not keep the economy from going off a cliff. A handful of people with conflicting interests could never come up with such a program. ''The E.U. is an odd construct - multiple political systems with disparate economies and fiscal policies but a single currency and monetary system,'' he said.
Now, just as was the case in the fall of 2008 before Lehman Brothers collapsed, the panicked rumor mill in Europe is in full swing. On Monday, traders were passing along rumors that a French bank and an Italian bank were on the verge of collapse. (There's no evidence that the rumors are true, but the concern is that such chatter can become a self-fulfilling prophesy.)
In Greece, regulators announced a two-month ban on short-selling to prevent investors from betting against stocks. Sounds just like 2008, right?
And when and if there is another bank in Europe - or worse, an entire country - on the precipice, it is unlikely there will be the political will to bail it out. Yes, just like Lehman Brothers.
In the United States, the speculation game jumped the pond. This time it centered on Bank of America, after a report that David Tepper, the founder of the hedge fund Appaloosa Management, had dumped his entire 17-million-share stake in the bank. (In truth, he has sold about 40 percent of his stake.)
Still, Mr. Paulson said he was less worried about the troubles in the financial sector of Wall Street than in Europe. ''In the U.S., our capital markets and banks are stable and much better capitalized and better regulated than they were,'' he said.
But he did suggest that the problems in Europe could be a lesson for us if we didn't get our house in order, echoing a thought that S.&P. made when it downgraded our long-term debt.
''Many of the Western democracies - including the U.S. - have a problem that voters want benefits they don't want to pay for,'' Mr. Paulson said.
Nonetheless, Mr. Paulson said he actually took some solace in the debate over the debt ceiling, despite its ugliness.
''The good news over the last six months or so - beginning with Bowles-Simpson - is that there is now a much better understanding of what is by far our biggest structural economic problem,'' he said referring to the Bowles-Simpson bipartisan fiscal commission that looked at ways to cut the deficit.
''Bowles-Simpson was particularly helpful by highlighting the fact that we are such a wealthy country that if we act soon we can deal with this problem with shared sacrifice but without any segment of our society having to sacrifice too much.''
Mr. Paulson, a longtime Republican, even appeared to break with party ranks by going so far as to opine that slashing spending wasn't the only answer. ''The most discouraging fact is that, as important as expense-cutting is - and it is essential that we cut - we can't just cut our way out of this problem.''
His comment implied that a tax overhaul - and the possibility of raising revenue, a prospect that most Republicans have castigated - may need to be on the negotiating table as part of any solution.
Unfortunately, while Mr. Paulson may be bullish on the long-term prospects for the United States and the nation's ability to pay back its debts, he is less convinced that a solution will come anytime soon.
''We need fundamental, structural reform and that is impossible without bipartisan compromise and cooperation,'' he said, ''which doesn't appear to be forthcoming before an election which changes the players.''
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Back on Stump, Romney Faults Obama on Downgrade

BYLINE: By ASHLEY PARKER

 BODY:
CONCORD, N.H. -- After a week's vacation, and facing questions about a relatively subdued campaign for the Republican presidential nomination, Mitt Romney kicked off his busiest week yet on Monday and wasted no time in blaming President Obama for America's credit rating downgrade.
Mr. Romney accused the White House of inverting President Harry S. Truman's political motto, ''The buck stops here,'' into ''The buck stops somewhere else,'' and called Mr. Obama's office a ''blame presidency.'' 
Mr. Romney, who has been criticized by fellow Republican candidates for remaining largely on the sidelines during the recent debate over the nation's debt ceiling, defended himself by saying that he had maintained a consistent, if quiet, position throughout the partisan bickering in Washington, favoring the ''cut, cap and balance'' plan passed by the House and defeated by the Senate.
''I didn't react day to day to every negotiation because my position was clear,'' he said. ''Cut, cap and balance was the right way for America to deal with this financial distress.''
Speaking to reporters before a speech to the Greater Concord Chamber of Commerce here, Mr. Romney addressed the ''sobering'' news that ''America's creditworthiness was in question,'' and continued to criticize the president throughout the day as he toured up and down New Hampshire, ending with a town-hall-style event in Nashua.
''In my view, that punctuated once again the failure of leadership of the president in Washington, D.C.,'' he said.
Though Mr. Romney, a former governor of Massachusetts, acknowledged that Mr. Obama was not solely responsible for Standard & Poor's downgrade of long-term federal debt to AA+ from AAA, he sought to place the most fault with the president, saying he was ''primarily responsible.''
''The president is the person that leads the nation and leads the effort in Washington, and if it's tough working there, welcome to the real world,'' said Mr. Romney. ''I'm afraid the president is just out of his depth when it comes to understanding how the private economy works.''
Ben LaBolt, Mr. Obama's re-election campaign press secretary, rejected the criticism.
''After ducking and dodging, bobbing and weaving during the debate over the best way to reduce the deficit,'' Mr. LaBolt said, ''it's telling that in a capitulation to the Tea Party, Governor Romney would have put our economy at great risk by letting the nation default on its obligations, opposing the bipartisan agreement.''
At a Rotary Club event at Fratello's Italian Grille in Manchester later in the day, potential voters noted that Mr. Romney seemed more relaxed and casual than he had in 2008. When a woman mentioned Mr. Romney's lakeside home in New Hampshire and asked what he thought the state could do to increase tourism, he accidentally substituted ''Massachusetts'' for ''New Hampshire,'' before recovering with a lighthearted quip. ''Perhaps the most powerful way to have more people see New Hampshire as a wonderful summer resort would be to have them see a president that summered here in New Hampshire,'' he said to laughter and applause.

HEADLINE: Past Time for a New Agenda: The moment calls for a president more interested in job growth than curbing debt

 BODY:
President Obama tried on Monday to restore the plunging confidence of investors, insisting the United States remains a triple-A country whatever Standard & Poor's might think. It didn't work with the stock markets, which sank again, and it did nothing to reassure the most important shareholders: ordinary Americans living from one paycheck to another, worried about their jobs or wondering how they will replace the one they lost.
Anyone hungering for a robust vision to invigorate the economy and increase employment is still hungry. 
No one was surprised that the president felt wounded by S.& P.'s downgrade of the nation's credit rating. In the defective logic of the Republican machine, that was Mr. Obama's fault because it occurred on his watch. (That's a breathtaking bit of hypocrisy, by the way, from the party that fabricated the debt-ceiling crisis.) The downgrade is a blow to American prestige and credibility. It had to be one reason Wall Street had its worst day since the crisis in 2008, although stagnating growth was hurting the markets before the downgrade.
The credit decision put a price tag on the agenda of dysfunction that Republicans brought to Washington, in which unnecessary crises are created to achieve their goals of shrinking government and bringing down Mr. Obama. When one of the two political parties announces its willingness to let the nation default, S.& P. essentially said, those who lend it money can no longer trust it to act rationally. Whatever flaws may exist in S.& P.'s arithmetic, that scolding is one that lawmakers richly deserve.
But having spent far too long haggling over the margins of the Republican agenda to reduce the deficit with only spending cuts, the president needs to move to a very different set of priorities. He should start making the case that it is foolish to focus the nation's attention solely on debt, where the Republicans want it, and instead shift every available resource toward jobs.
If he becomes passionate about the government's ability to think creatively about a turnaround, he might just inspire a few Americans -- some of them lawmakers -- to join with him. If he stays locked into the arid agenda of the Republicans, the economy will remain as dormant as his speech on Monday, which is just where his rivals hope it will be in November 2012.
The three proposals he mentioned were useful but only as a start. Increased investment in infrastructure, renewing the payroll tax cut and extending jobless benefits are vital to prevent further backsliding. Inaction on the payroll tax and unemployment benefits could cost nearly a full percentage point in growth next year.
Where, though, is the broader vision? Mr. Obama said nothing about direct job creation. He did not mention that unemployment among high school graduates under 25 is averaging 21.5 percent. He said nothing about more help for homeowners who are under water, though easier refinancing rules would help many borrowers at little cost to taxpayers. He could vigorously support the Senate bill to reduce taxes on businesses by forgiving loans to states that replenish their unemployment funds.
Defeatists may say that it is impossible to consider programs like these at a time when Republicans will find a way to kill any worthy idea from the White House, especially those that might require some short-term spending. But the shackles forged by Republican lawmakers can only be broken with the power of good ideas.
If Mr. Obama is worried about his reputation as a spender, he can remind the public that he just agreed to a huge package of cuts lasting a decade. He is now free to move past that deal, to outline much bolder plans for a turnaround. Then he could defy Republicans -- with their crabbed vision of government's role -- to stand in his way.

HEADLINE: Perry Signals Intent to Enter Race, Sending a Jolt to G.O.P. Candidates

BYLINE: By JEFF ZELENY; Michael Shear contributed reporting from Des Moines, and Ashley Parker from Concord, N.H.

 BODY:
DES MOINES -- Gov. Rick Perry of Texas delivered a long-distance jolt to the Republican presidential campaign on Monday by signaling that he intends to join the race and visit South Carolina and New Hampshire on Saturday, the same day his rivals are battling for survival in the Iowa Straw Poll.
Mr. Perry has flirted with the notion of running for months, but his decision comes as the Republican field tries to respond to a downgrade in the nation's credit rating, a collapse in the financial markets and a sustained period of high unemployment. These troubles have created an opening for his candidacy. 
''There is still a thirst for another voice to come in,'' said Craig Schoenfeld, an Iowa Republican who is leading a group here called Americans for Perry, which has been signing up supporters for the governor. ''They are looking for the kind of leadership he has shown in Texas, while the country has gone the other direction.''
While Mr. Perry will stop short of making an announcement this weekend, aides said, he is recruiting campaign workers in critical states, securing fund-raising commitments and preparing to be fully engaged in the race by early next month, when Republicans meet for three debates. Advisers said he had moved beyond the trial-balloon stage of gauging support to executing a strategy.
The first test of his impact on the race could come as soon as Saturday, when candidates descend on Ames for the Iowa Straw Poll, a test of organizational strength. His name will not be on the ballot, but Americans for Perry, the independent group financed by several friends and political associates, has been urging supporters to cast a write-in ballot for him. That effort could erode support from his rivals.
In a week when Republican candidates had hoped to introduce themselves to voters through the rituals of the Iowa State Fair, featuring the famed butter cow and old-time speeches on the political soapbox, the spotlight of the race was suddenly yanked south. The rollout of Mr. Perry's prospective presidential bid threw a volatile new element into the contest.
The intentions of Mr. Perry, which were the subject of considerable political chatter in Iowa and New Hampshire on Monday, were being carefully watched by the rest of the Republican field. The candidates, including Michele Bachmann, Tim Pawlenty and Mitt Romney, traveled across both early-voting states, delivering forceful critiques of how President Obama has handled the latest stretch of bleak economic news.
Mr. Romney told voters in New Hampshire that the decision by Standard & Poor's to downgrade the nation's credit rating was the latest example of a failure of leadership in Washington. He said the president should take ultimate responsibility for the downgrade.
As they assess the Republican field, many voters seem to be more eager to hear about the candidates than listen to attacks on the president. At a town-hall-style meeting on Monday evening, when asked whether he could compete in all regions of the country, Mr. Romney declared, ''I'm going to do pretty darn well in Dixie.''
''You know there was a poll, I guess it was about a month ago, that was a little surprising,'' Mr. Romney said, making a veiled reference to Mr. Perry. ''It had me as the only Republican candidate who in Texas could beat President Obama. I think I was ahead by eight points. No one else was ahead of him.''
At the same hour that the president spoke from the White House and tried to reassure Americans about the credit downgrade and the quavering economy, Mr. Perry inched closer to declaring his candidacy and Donald Trump threatened to re-enter the presidential race as an independent during an extended interview on CNN.
The commotion threatened to overshadow the rest of the Republican field.
Mr. Pawlenty, who said the future of his candidacy was dependent on a strong showing at the straw poll, said a culture of entertainment and celebrity had bled into the political arena. Over breakfast with reporters, he conceded that ''we are not ever going to be the cable TV, shooting star of the month.''
''At least for president, at least for the Oval Office,'' Mr. Pawlenty said, ''I think the country is still going to put somebody in there who is experienced, seasoned, strong, thoughtful, with a record of results.''
When Mrs. Bachmann's blue campaign bus rolled into the parking lot of the Cass County Fairgrounds in Atlantic, Iowa, on Monday, a modest crowd was on hand. She is seeking to turn the enthusiasm that has flared in the first two months of her candidacy into an organized force that can pass its first test of strength at the party's straw poll.
''So much bad news this last week,'' Mrs. Bachmann said. ''The problem is, we have not had someone in the White House who has had the backbone to make these tough decisions that have to be made.''
The crises back in Washington, along with the attack on a helicopter in Afghanistan that killed 30 Americans, cast a serious and somber tone over the presidential race. At each campaign stop, Mrs. Bachmann offered a prayer for the fallen and took a moment to identify Jon Tumilson, a member of the Navy Seal team, from Rockford, Iowa.

HEADLINE: Elusive Prescriptions For an Erratic Ailment: Pressure Grows on Federal Reserve To Dig Deeper Into Its Arsenal

BYLINE: By BINYAMIN APPELBAUM

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The Federal Reserve is back in the spotlight, with investors anxiously wondering if the central bank will end a two-month hiatus and announce new measures to support the economy on Tuesday.
Under its chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, the Fed has pushed the boundaries of its authority and defied opposition during its unprecedented four-year-old campaign to rescue the financial system and revive the economy.
As the Fed's policy-making board convenes Tuesday, with the gains of the last two years slipping away and the government focused on getting smaller, the looming question is whether Mr. Bernanke and his lieutenants are willing to press deeper into uncharted waters. 
Mr. Bernanke has held the Fed steady since June, saying that he wanted to judge the health of the economy for several months before considering any additional measures.
But the news since then has been uniformly grim. The government reported that the economy grew at an annual rate of only 0.8 percent in the first half of the year. The number of people with jobs is shrinking. Governments at all levels are slashing spending. The stock market has plunged, evaporating vast amounts of household wealth. And investors once again are fleeing Bank of America and Citigroup, rescued at such a heavy toll only two years ago.
Close watchers of the central bank had expected that this meeting in August would pass quietly, with difficult decisions deferred until the autumn. But just as happened last summer, the moment is rising to meet the Fed.
''I think that they should reconsider their judgment'' to wait, said Joseph E. Gagnon, a former Federal Reserve official and now a scholar at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. Mr. Gagnon said that Mr. Bernanke, who has said publicly that he is reluctant to act, was right to fear the consequences. ''He is expressing the angst of a sailor in uncharted waters, in which he's right,'' he said, ''but you have to weigh that against the very real cost in unemployment.''
The Fed keeps its eyes on the medium term, like a driver steering a car down a highway, because its actions only gradually affect the economy. Donald L. Kohn, who stepped down as the Fed's vice chairman last year, said the recent setbacks were nonetheless significant, because they reduced the trajectory of growth, making it more likely that the Fed would need to act.
''To the extent that you thought fiscal policy was in a tightening mode, you'd factor that into your forecast,'' said Mr. Kohn, now a fellow at the Brookings Institution. ''And to the extent that you thought the stock market was reducing the country's wealth, the cost of credit for marginal borrowers was rising, you would want to factor those into your forecast and into your monetary policy decisions.''
The Fed has held its benchmark short-term interest rate near zero since December 2008, flooding the financial system with the nearest thing to free money. The central bank also has amassed a portfolio of $2.9 trillion in Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities, driving down long-term interest rates by accepting low rates, and pushing investors into stocks and other riskier assets.
A number of independent studies have concluded that the asset purchases gave the economy a modest but meaningful boost by reducing rates, an argument that can be summarized in the simple observation that stocks climbed after the most recent round of purchases was announced last August; the purchase of $600 billion in securities was completed at the end of June; and now the market is falling.
Most public attention has focused on the possibility that the Fed will renew its asset purchases, the most drastic option available to the central bank, but also the one it has said is the most unlikely.
There are even reasons to think a new round of asset purchases could be more potent. Because rates already are low, a similar reduction in rates would be larger in percentage terms. Also, the first round of purchases presumably plucked Treasuries from the hands of those most willing to sell. The remaining holders are likely to demand a better deal, driving down rates more.
But some members of the Federal Open Markets Committee have said that they do not support additional purchases, expressing concern that the extensive portfolio will interfere with the central bank's ability to control inflation when the economy strengthens.
Instead, the Fed is more likely to begin any renewed aid campaign with smaller gestures.
The most basic measure available to the Fed is to promise that it will keep interest rates near zero for at least six months, or a year, or some other specified period of time. The central bank has promised after each of its meetings since late 2008 to keep interest rates near zero ''for an extended period.'' Earlier this year, Mr. Bernanke said that each renewal of that promise meant there would be no changes for at least a few months. A promise with a more distant expiration date would reduce uncertainty about at least one aspect of the economy.
The Fed also could make a similar commitment for the first time regarding its huge investment portfolio. Selling assets removes money from circulation, tightening monetary conditions, so a promise to maintain the portfolio for a certain number of months would have a similar effect. Moreover, the Fed has said it will start to sell assets before raising interest rates, so a promise about the portfolio also would extend the Fed's commitment to maintain low rates.
Another available option would be to maintain the size of the portfolio, but to shift its composition toward bonds with longer terms. The Fed initially was reluctant to do this because those bonds would take longer to disappear naturally, but that concern may have been eased by the board's affirmative decision eventually to shrink its portfolio through asset sales.
None of these options is likely to spur growth significantly. Economists generally agree that the economy is suffering from a lack of demand. The Fed can provide lots of money at low cost, but it can't convince companies to build new factories unless they think there will be a market for their products. And it can't convince consumers to spend money on those products if they don't have jobs, or they've already borrowed more money than they can afford to repay.
''I don't think any of these things would have a huge effect on rates,'' Mr. Kohn said. ''Could they help to reduce the cost of capital and ease financial conditions? Sure, and that would help encourage spending. But I think the major problem here is that people don't want to spend, and that's about confidence in the economy and the government.''

HEADLINE: Latest Updates on Financial Market Upheaval

HIGHLIGHT: The Lede is tracking the global financial markets on Tuesday.

 BODY:
5:52 P.M. | What Was It About the Fed?
Jonathan Lewis, founding principal and chairman of the investment committee of Samson Capital Advisors, provided this account of the reaction after the Fed statement, which he said "had the impact of the Hindenburg." 
Just before the statement came out at 2:15, the S.&P. 500 was in 1,140 range, and by 2:45 it had dropped to about 1,100. Initially, Mr. Lewis said, investors basically were asking incredulously: "You are giving us that? You are going to keep rates low?"
But then, the bond market focused carefully on the words, which were "really quite unusual" insofar as the Fed designated a specific time period for the low rates.
"They have never said that, I don't believe," he said. "I think it is very rare."
That had meaningful consequences for the bond market, particularly for the shorter end of the curve at which investors were basically told that rates would stay at zero for the next two years.
"You had this very powerful rally," he said. "The rally stuck with the short end of the curve." 
The ignition mechanism for stocks was seeing the Treasury rally, which implied low rates for a specific period of time which would improve the relative valuations of equities. "The afterburners kicked in as stocks watched an extraordinary Treasury rally."
 In addition, there was probably short covering. "We are all speculating now. One can imagine there must have been short positions accelerating the fall. This began to be a reason to cover." - 
4:50 P.M. | Losers on a Winning Day
In the closing surge, all 30 components of the Dow Jones industrial average ended higher. And among the stocks in the Standard & Poor's 500 - all of which had finished lower on Monday - there were 493 gainers on Tuesday.
One of the seven that didn't join the advancing parade was the publisher McGraw-Hill - the owner of Standard & Poor's itself, the ratings agency that downgraded United States debt on Friday. Its shares were down 56 cents, to $37.56.
4:42 P.M. | From Twitter: What Just Happened
The surge, retreat and resurgence of American stock markets on Tuesday has provoked plenty of confusion, and plenty of verbiage.
after today, anyone still believing that financial #markets act rationally can say Hi to Santa from me on Xmas: http://t.co/unORtZhTue Aug 9 20:31:52 via Tweet ButtonArthur Honegger

4:20 P.M. | Comparing Fed Statements
Via Credit Suisse, a look at Tuesday's Fed statement, compared to the statement from June 22. Differences are highlighted in yellow.
4:11 P.M. | Markets Up Sharply at Close
The Dow Jones industrial average closed Tuesday at 11,239.77, up 429.92, or 3.98 percent. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index closed at 1,172.53, up 53.07, or 4.74 percent.
4:00 P.M. | Markets Up in Rally
After an initial wobble in the wake of the Fed statement, the market is roaring ahead.
In a late-afternoon rally, the Dow is up 3.2 percent, and the S&P is up 3.8 percent. The Nasdaq composite is up 4.5 percent.
3:44 P.M. | Bond Yields Keep Falling
Perhaps unsurprisingly, after the Fed painted such a gloomy growth picture and said that the federal funds rate will be kept where it is for two years, bond yields are falling.
Yields on 10-year United States Treasury bonds are down to 2.2 percent (from 3.2 percent at the start of July) .
And two-year yields, already at a record low, are now down to 0.186 percent.
Amid all this tumult, investors see Treasuries as the safest place to park their money.
But investors are going to get paid virtually nothing in return. - 
3:17 P.M. | What to Make of the Fed
Some choice phrases from Tuesday's Fed statement on the economy. A gloomy picture, indeed:
And so in conclusion the Fed's policy will be for "exceptionally low levels for the federal funds rate at least through mid-2013."
That moves the next rate change beyond the next presidential election.
But it brought dissent among the Fed's committee: three members said they wanted to keep the less tough language of past statements - that rates would stay at exceptionally low rates for an extended period, presumably in case inflation pressures start building.
The markets don't quite know what to make of it - after a few wild swings, stocks are roughly flat.
But there is also a flight to quality into United States Treasuries - 10-year bond yields are down to 2.25 percent.
What else could the Fed have done? Some analysts were expecting it to lengthen the maturities of the bonds it hold. It just kept that option open: "The Committee will regularly review the size and composition of its securities holdings and is prepared to adjust those holdings as appropriate." - 
3:13 P.M. | When Fed Members Disagree
In his article on Tuesday's announcement by the Fed, The Times's Binya Appelbaum points out that there seems to be tension between members of the Federal Open Market Committee:
Many economists and outside analysts argue that the Fed should act more aggressively in response to rising unemployment and faltering growth. But internal divisions are limiting the central bank's ability to pursue additional steps.
Even the modest commitment announced Tuesday was passed only by a vote of 7 to 3. The central bank prefers to act unanimously whenever possible.
The dissenters included Richard W. Fisher, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas; Narayana Kocherlakota, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis; and Charles Plosser, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia.
The three men regard inflation as a more serious threat to the economy than unemployment.
2:52 P.M. | More on That Banner
According to Foster Kamer at The New York Observer, the "You Should All Be Fired" banner that was flown over Lower Manhattan earlier today was directed not at Standard & Poor's, but at Wall Street in general:
It's directed at Washington. The Republicans, Democrats, President. Not at S & P.
Earlier.
2:42 P.M. | Markets Down After Fed Announcement
United States stock indexes gave up their gains on Tuesday after the Federal Reserve's announcement. 
The Dow Jones industrial average was down 161 points, or 1.49 percent, and the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index was down almost 15 points, or 1.31 percent.
2:27 P.M. | Fed Statement
From the Fed statement:
To promote the ongoing economic recovery and to help ensure that inflation, over time, is at levels consistent with its mandate, the Committee decided today to keep the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent. The Committee currently anticipates that economic conditions-including low rates of resource utilization and a subdued outlook for inflation over the medium run-are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels for the federal funds rate at least through mid-2013. The Committee also will maintain its existing policy of reinvesting principal payments from its securities holdings. The Committee will regularly review the size and composition of its securities holdings and is prepared to adjust those holdings as appropriate.
2:20 P.M. | Fed to Hold Rates Exceptionally Low Through Mid-2013
The Federal Reserve signaled that rates would likely remain exceptionally low through mid-2013.
2:10 P.M. | Oil Falls Below $80 a Barrel
Just as The Lede was noting the rise in commodity prices, oil has slipped lower, and is now below $80 a barrel.
One factor behind the lower price may be that OPEC cut its demand forecasts for 2011 and 2012. - 
1:51 P.M. | Commodity Prices: Gold and Oil Rise
As investors wait for the Fed announcement, stocks are still up sharply. But what's been happening to commodity prices?
In the past few sessions, with stocks selling off, gold rose, as investors poured into the safe haven.
And amid the general perceived slowdown in global growth, commodities like oil slipped.
Today, stocks are recovering, and so are commodities.
This is from Bloomberg: "The S & P GSCI index of 24 commodities rose 0.9 percent. Oil climbed 1.1 percent to $82.24 a barrel, reversing losses of as much as 6.9 percent."
But gold is continuing its climb: "Gold added 1.1 percent in London, after jumping as much as 3.5 percent to a record $1,780.10 an ounce." - 
1:48 P.M. | Fed Expectations
In a quick survey of market participants, Nomura Securities asked what they expect out of the Fed announcement.
Out of 269 responses, 22 percent expected a third round of quantitative easing. Most (88 percent) expect stronger language from the Fed to stand firm the difficult markets. - 
1:28 P.M. | Market Update
With about 45 minutes until the Fed's announcement, the Dow Jones industrial average was up 174 points, or 1.62 percent. The Standard & Poor's 500 index was up 24 points, or 2.19 percent.
1:19 P.M. | A Tale of a Plane, a Banner and Standard & Poor's
While tracking Tuesday's market moves, The Lede came across a riveting post from @AmerBanker, the Twitter feed of American Banker:
An airplane just buzzed past the S&P office in Lower Manhattan pulling a banner: "Thanks for the downgrade. You should all be fired."Tue Aug 9 15:36:38 via HootSuiteAmerican Banker
AmerBanker
Some skepticism and a lot of Internet searching followed. And then Maria Aspan, American Banker's consumer finance editor, provided some evidence:
Not-great photo of plane that buzzed #s&p (and @AmerBanker) offices- it's small but you can see red letters on banner. http://t.co/CtPPFGdTue Aug 9 16:47:29 via Twitter for iPhoneMaria Aspan
mariaaspan
Ms. Aspan provided The Lede permission to publish the image, which she said was taken by Andy Sobel of American Banker.
It's not quite legible, and the resolution makes it impossible to confirm exactly what's written on the banner. But this seems consistent with the tale.
Anyone have a better photo? - 
Update: Banner directed at Wall Street, not Standard & Poor's.
12:38 P.M. | Lowering the Anxiety Level
The VIX is down. Some of the anxiety seems to be going out of the market.
The closely watched index, which measures volatility, touched 48 during the sell-off on Monday.
But it's down to 40 on Tuesday - still high, but a sign of the calmer trading conditions and the better mood in the markets.
It's all about the Fed today. The central bank's policy-making committee meets, and then releases a statement around 2 p.m. Eastern time.
This comment from a trader on one New York trading desk sums up the mood on Wall Street: "It's quiet. It is Fed day. There is a lot of waiting around."
Expect more action after the Fed's statement.
Todd Colvin, a trader at MF Global, while not expecting any action from the Fed, says that in the statement there may at least be "some language that the Fed is prepared to act when necessary."
"Markets will be looking for something along the lines of 'We are here for you' in the light of the economy and the market moves," he said. - 
12:35 P.M. | A Distinction With a Difference
In the Economix blog, Motoko Rich notes that the stock market's performance isn't always consistent with the broader economy's:
...here's a thought from Ian Shepherdson, chief United States economist at the High Frequency Economics research firm: a weak stock market is not always a sign of a weak economy.
Remember Black Monday, 1987? By that October day, stocks had fallen 36 percent from their peak in August. Yet in 1988, the economy grew by 4.1 percent, even though the market had recovered only half its losses.
12:03 P.M. | Spanish and Italian Bond Yields Drop
Raphael Minder writes from Madrid:
Spanish and Italian government bond prices rose and their yields fell Tuesday for a third consecutive session after the European Central Bank stepped in to purchase their sovereign debt, part of efforts to prevent the euro zone debt crisis from deepening in two of the largest economies that share the currency.
The E.C.B.'s purchasing of Spanish and Italian bonds, which was reported by traders but which the central bank itself would not confirm, came amid broader market turmoil...

11:47 A.M. | Financial Stocks Bounce Back
Some bank stocks that fell precipitously on Monday are ticking back up, as :
The financial sector was leading the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index higher after the first half hour of trading.
All eyes were on shares of Bank of America, which plummeted 20.3 percent on Monday to their lowest level in more than two years. The stock recovered Tuesday morning, rising nearly 5 percent, to $6.80, but off its earlier high of $7.70.
11:41 A.M. | Waiting for the Fed as Markets Rebound
American indexes are up this morning, but the markets are likely to be driven in the afternoon by the announcement from the Federal Reserve's policy-making board.
As The Times's Binyamin Appelbaum wrote:
Under its chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, the Fed has pushed the boundaries of its authority and defied opposition during its unprecedented four-year-old campaign to rescue the financial system and revive the economy.
As the Fed's policy-making board convenes Tuesday, with the gains of the last two years slipping away and the government focused on getting smaller, the looming question is whether Mr. Bernanke and his lieutenants are willing to press deeper into uncharted waters.
Mr. Bernanke has held the Fed steady since June, saying that he wanted to judge the health of the economy for several months before considering any additional measures.
The Washington Post's Neil Irwin suggests that Mr. Bernanke may have few options:
If Fed officials do nothing, they look out of touch and the government seems to be out of bullets. But the actions they might plausibly take probably wouldn't do much to either soothe markets or boost the economy.
And central bankers are loath to seem to be responding to the latest ups and downs of financial markets. They're supposed to keep their eye on the ball - in this case, the performance of the underlying economy.
11:21 A.M. | Keeping an Eye on Volume
All told, 18 billion shares traded on United States stock exchanges on Monday, the most active day in a year.
About 13.7 billion is the average for the past five days, according to BATS Trading, one of the big electronic exchanges. And average daily volume for the year through the end of July, before the latest bout of market volatility, was 7.48 billion shares.
Volumes seem a bit more subdued on Tuesday.
According to BATS, 4 billion shares have traded so far on Tuesday. Although prices are up sharply, most traders are probably sitting on the sidelines waiting for the event of the day - the Federal Reserve announcement at 2:15 P.M. Eastern time. - 
11:17 A.M. | The Value of Projections
Monday's turmoil and Tuesday's rebound could certainly leave investors feeling adrift. One voice of reassurance comes from The Times's Nate Silver at the FiveThirtyEight blog:
Stock prices, especially in the United States, have had a reasonably strong tendency to revert to the mean. The short version of this is that, although your portfolio may have lost a lot of value over the past couple of weeks, you're likely to get at least some of that money back (in fact, quite possibly most of it) because expectations for future returns have now improved.
But before you get too comfortable, consider what Floyd Norris has to say about the reliability of projections. Mr. Norris took a look at the Standard & Poor's report explaining its decision to downgrade U.S. debt, which decries that government actions are not as predictable as they used to be.
How predictable, for example, were things in the year 2000? According to a Standard & Poor's report that Mr. Norris quotes:
On a broader scale, the president and the speaker of the House of Representatives have both called for the elimination of federal public debt by 2013 and 2015, respectively. Both plans would eliminate publicly held debt over about the same time frame...
10:56 A.M. | Whether Up or Down, Brokers Are Touching
The U.S. markets seem to be rebounding on Tuesday, but one notable trend continues. Workers on trading floors around the world continue to be photographed with hands on their faces.
The Times's Peter Lattman noted in an article on DealBook:
The Brokers With Hands on Their Faces Blog is exactly what it sounds like and nothing more: a blog that posts photographs of market players putting their hands on their faces.
"I guess that in a morbid way the site has suddenly come back into fashion," said Matthew R. Robison, the blog's creator. On Friday, the day after the market dropped 500 points, Mr. Robison said the blog's traffic reached a record of nearly 50,000 visitors.
The photos above suggest that wherever the markets are headed, Mr. Robison will have plenty of images to choose from.
10:30 A.M. | Mystery Sellers
Who's selling?
Michael Matson, of Matson Financial Advisors in Danbury, Conn., says he isn't.
He advises clients with $500,000 to $5 million in the markets. He has certainly been fielding lots of anxious phone calls over the past few weeks. Some customers want to know if it's too late to get into gold.
But so far his clients are too scared to either buy or sell. He's also asked four other financial advisers - together he estimates they manage about $1.5 billion to $2 billion in assets - and they've not been seeing any selling either.
"Someone was out there selling," he said. "It's not retail. Is it the institutions?"
Whoever selling seems to be buying today. The S&P 500 index is now up more than 2 percent. - Graham Bowley
10:08 A.M. | And Now It's a Surge
Call it a second wind. In the second quarter-hour of trading, stocks headed higher once again, and shortly after 10 a.m., the Dow was up 180 points.
10:05 A.M. | An Eye on Sovereign Debt
Credit default swap rates in the euro zone - the cost of insuring government debt against default - are making interesting reading.
The swaps on French government debt rose on Monday to unprecedented levels. That was interpreted by some analysts as markets searching for the next downgrade after S&P removed the United States' AAA rating.
Today, swaps rates on German debt are up. After the European Central Bank intervened to prop up Italian and Spanish government bond markets on Monday, investors apparently fear Germany could be dragged into Europe's debt problems.
This from Reuters:
"German five-year C.D.S. prices rose above their UK equivalent for the first time on Tuesday on concerns over Germany's credit standing if the European Central Bank's purchases of Spanish and Italian government bonds fail to stem the euro zone debt crisis."
10:02 A.M. | Prognosticating About the Fed
As the market awaits the announcement this afternoon from the Federal Open Market Committee, the Fed's policy making group, the financial services firm Janney Montgomery Scott suggested that some think Ben Bernanke will take no action. "Although investors may be hoping for further stimulus commitment at this afternoon's FOMC release, the Fed has been hesitant in the past to take action simply to support stock prices," it said. - Graham Bowley
9:52 A.M. | A Quick Fade 
It didn't last long.
Within 15 minutes after the Wall Street opening, the stock market lost all of its early gains.
Trading is likely to be like this, with the stock market struggling to find direction, until the Fed's policy-making board finishes its latest meeting today.
It will give its latest conclusions on the economy at about 2 p.m. Eastern time. Then traders will have a sense of whether or not the Fed will take new measures to help the ailing economy. - Graham Bowley
9:36 A.M. | U.S. Markets Up Slightly at Opening
The markets in the United States have opened up.
After sell-offs and recovery in Asia and Europe, the mood in New York trading seems better despite the big drop on Monday.
In the opening moments, the Dow Jones industrial average was up 80 points. The Standard & Poor's 500 index was up 1 percent.
Other indicators seem to point to better, though volatile, trading.
The VIX - a closely watched measure of volatility, sometimes called the "fear index" by traders - is still high, though. It's still above a reading of about 48, the highest levels since March 2009. (It got up to 80 during the financial crisis. It was down at 16 just a month ago.).
Yields on 10-year Treasuries had ticked back up slightly to 2.36 percent. Despite the Standard & Poor's downgrade of United States debt, Treasury bond yields had fallen Monday to 2.31 percent in the general flight to safety. -

Coming off a 634-point plunge in the Dow, how much difference will a day make?
After the contortions on Wall Street spread into Tuesday's trading in Asia and in the early going in Europe, investors seem to have found some reasons to buy. European markets, down nearly 5 percent in the early going, largely recovered, with indexes in London and Paris moving into positive territory.
We will be watching the day's trading on Wall Street and developments elsewhere today on The Lede. What will happen when the markets open in New York? Floyd Norris, on the Economix blog, writes, "The great sell-off may be taking pause." But he adds:
What remains to be seen is whether there will actually be buyers for shares when trading opens in New York. Phil Roth, a longtime market watcher with Miller Tabak, says there is little evidence that either individual investors or traditional money managers are putting in money, so buying by hedge funds may be needed.

HEADLINE: Plus Ca Change: Riots in London and Paris

BYLINE: J. DAVID GOODMAN


HIGHLIGHT: For many, the images from London called to mind the 2005 riots in France, but the events themselves appear to have less in common than meets the eye.

 BODY:
Seen from Paris, the images of charred cars and the silhouettes of urban young people battling with police in London called to mind the 2005 riots in France.
As with London, Paris found itself repeatedly convulsed by explosive riots over successive fire-filled nights, marked by nearly 3,000 arrests, scores of injuries and one death. In both cases, the violence was set off by the deaths of young people during confrontations with police.
At the time, many in France wondered whether the urban unrest -- concentrated in neighborhoods of large public housing complexes segregated on the edges of cities -- pointed to a systematic failure of French society to integrate its increasingly diverse population. 
Some looked to Britain for answers, and even to the London neighborhood of Tottenham, where this month's rioting began. As Rue 89, a French news site, observed earlier this week, the French media in 2005 presented Tottenham as an emblematic British neighborhood where, despite high unemployment among its young people, they felt integrated into society. 
A France 2 television report, broadcast in November, 2005, described a visit by a delegation from the town of Evry, outside Paris, to Tottenham. The report called Tottenham part of London "regularly shaken by riots" in earlier decades, where "a lot of money was invested" and "the promotion of ethnic minorities," had been made a priority.
In 2005, many French writers and researchers focused on the failure of the "French model," with its emphasis of an ideal of Frenchness over multiculturalism, and looked instead to the "Anglo-Saxon" model promoted in Britain and the United States, where ethnic and religious communities are encouraged. 
But that easy division had already been complicated by the July 2005 subway bombings in London and concerns over home-grown terrorism.
Now, as the violent unrest continues to spread through Britain and the pendulum of cross-Channel self-reflection seemed to swing back again in France's favor, the French press have had a somewhat muted reaction. For the most part, writers have seemed to resist grand pronouncements about the failures of social models. 
The center-right daily Le Figaro published an interview on Monday with a British scholar who described the unrest as common in all big cities and something that the police will soon put down. Nothing like the French riots, in other words. 
To at least one French blogger living in London, the media in France seem to have underestimated the situation in London so far: "It's chaos here."
Perhaps it is because the two situations are different. The French rioters in the suburbs of Paris rarely penetrated the center of the city or its wealthy neighborhoods. While there were arresting photos of fire and mayhem, most the destruction involved the burning of cars and government buildings. Looting was not a major part of the unrest.
In Britain, by contrast, the looting of goods, like sneakers and flat-screen TVs, appears to be a central focus of many of those taking part in the riots, leading the London police to refer to the unrest as a kind of "violent consumerism," according to the Sky News reporter Martin Brunt.
Writing on the Global Spin blog, Bruce Crumley, Time magazine's Paris bureau chief, points out that because the French rioters were mostly sequestered by housing policy to large complexes in areas on the outskirts of town, there were fewer symbols of wealth on hand to loot or destroy. (Another major difference -- the absence of social media technology -- may have prevented mobs from converging easily and quickly on locations far from home.)
In stark contrast to the districts in London now suffering violence, therefore, virtually all unrest that rocked France in 2005 occurred in these project-heavy outlying suburbs. And for all intents and purposes, the nightly clashes in 2005 France were never exported anywhere near the businesses, shops, and primarily white, affluent residents of French city centers.
Mr. Cromley adds that, in this way, the violence could be more easily contained, at the price of failing to solve the underlying social problem. 
Indeed, one of the biggest complaints that France's banlieue residents continue airing is how their geographical remoteness from the centers of France's main cities only the most evident form of their exclusion from and rejection by wider, productive, profitable French society.
Physical and architectural exclusion does not appear to be among the many reasons cited in Britain as experts and the press search for explanations for the continuing violence. 
Some have pointed to what The Guardian calls "social exclusion." The Independent, several years ago, argued that the demonization of certain groups of young people could be counterproductive. 
On the other side of the political spectrum, there is outrage at any consideration of the reasons behind such destructive behavior. 
Or as the Daily Mail put it: "Left-wing cynics blame the Tory cuts for orgy of violence: MPs and activists line up to make excuses for thugs."
At least they didn't blame France.

HEADLINE: Long-Term Investors Can Relax (A Little)

BYLINE: NATE SILVER


HIGHLIGHT: If you're looking 10 or especially 20 years out, your long-term investment outlook may be affected much less than you might think by the recent market action.

 BODY:
The short-term fluctuations in the stock market obviously can be maddening to anyone with more than a few pennies invested. In the time that I've been working on this article, futures prices on the Dow Jones Industrial Average have fluctuated greatly, showing everything from a 300-point loss to a 300-point gain to open Tuesday. The next few days and weeks, and possibly also the next couple months and years, are liable to be turbulent.
If your focus is on the long term, however -- five years from now as an absolute minimum but preferably 10 or more years ahead -- I can offer you at least a little comfort. Stock prices, especially in the United States, have had a reasonably strong tendency to revert to the mean. The short version of this is that, although your portfolio may have lost a lot of value over the past couple of weeks, you're likely to get at least some of that money back (in fact, quite possibly most of it) because expectations for future returns have now improved.
The long version of the story flows from something my colleague David Leonhardt wrote about the other day. Mr. Leonhardt, citing the research of a Yale economist, Robert J. Shiller, takes the view that stock prices are predictable to some degree over the long run. Mr. Shiller's research has found, for instance, that when P/E ratios -- the ratio of stock prices to corporate earnings over the previous 10 years -- are relatively high, the market is overvalued and tends to produce below-average (although not necessarily negative) returns over the next decade or two. And they produce above-average returns when this ratio is low. 
There is some debate about the way Mr. Shiller's ratio is calculated -- as well as what the appropriate ratio should be. A bullish view is that P/E ratios have tended to improve somewhat over time, and that something as high as a 20:1 P/E ratio may represent fair value. By that standard, the S&P 500 -- which closed with a P/E ratio of 19.3 on Monday afternoon -- may now be very slightly undervalued. 
A more conservative view is that recent ratios have been inflated by the various unsustainable bubbles of recent years, and looking toward the long-term average of about 16:1 is safer. By that measure, the S&P 500 remains about 20 percent overvalued, despite the recent sell-off. 
An even simpler approach, which sidesteps the need to make some of these calculations, is to apply the methodology that we used for G.D.P. the other day, and to compare the current value of the stock market against its long-term trend. Over the long-run, according to Mr. Shiller's data, the value of the S&P 500 has appreciated by about 2.2 percent annually, adjusted for inflation. (You may have read elsewhere that the stock market returns 8 percent per year. But about 3 percent of that is from dividend earnings, which do provide real value to investors, and another 2 or 3 percent is from inflation, which doesn't. If the real value of the S&P 500 increased by 8 percent a year dividends and inflation, it would be valued at about 2,000,000 points right now.)
Results may vary, and substantially, over the near term -- none of this is intended for the sort of people who watch "Mad Money." But this has been a reasonably reliable long-term benchmark. Anomalies in pricing can persist for several years, and occasionally even for a decade or somewhat more, but gravity gets the better of them sooner or later.
Here's the bad news: stocks may still be overvalued, according to this measure. The past 15 years or so have been a period of extremely high stock valuations, although really there have been three separate bubbles: Irrational Exuberance Part I ("Pets.com Cemetery"), Irrational Exuberance Part II ("The Fundamentals are Sound"), and Irrational Exuberance Part III ("S&P Strikes Back"). The appropriate value for the S&P 500, according to this method, is roughly 915 points, about 20 percent where it closed on Monday. (By extension, the Dow Jones Industrial Average "should" be priced at about 9,000 points.)
Each bubble has been less extreme than the previous one, and stocks even returned to the point where they were slightly cheap for a brief period in 2009. But, although many traders would disagree with these methods, it may not be entirely appropriate to characterize the recent sell-off as a "panic" given that valuations were arguably inflated to begin with.
The good news is that a 20 percent overvaluation still implies a profit for long-run oriented investors -- a considerably better profit, in fact, that might have been expected several months ago.
Historically, the current valuation of the S&P 500 (as of Monday afternoon's close) has been associated with an annualized return of about 4.3 percent over the next 10 years, including dividends but after inflation. That's not bad, especially considering that bonds now provide very little premium over inflation. 
The 4.3 percent figure is a long-term average; returns could be considerably better or worse. The 95 percent confidence interval on this calculation is about 6.3 points, and the errors compound over time. What that means is that $10,000 invested in the stock market today could reasonably be expected to be worth anywhere from about $8,200 to $27,500 10 years from now, adjusted for inflation.
So stocks are not a riskless investment -- but they are a better buy than they were, for instance, in February, when the 10-year projected return was just 2.3 percent per year. (Very occasionally, in fact, the projected return on stocks has been negative over the 10-year horizon according to this formula: for brief periods in 1901 and 1929, and then over more sustained portions of 1997-2002, and during parts of 2006 and 2007.)
Maybe you aren't ready to buy stocks -- but you had some investments already. Those investments have almost certainly lost value. Specifically, you've lost about 17 percent of your stake since February if you had been invested in an S&P 500 index fund.
However, the improvement in projected returns almost makes up for the loss that you've experienced so far. If you had $10,000 invested in the S&P in February, appreciating at a 2.3 percent annual rate, you'd have expected it to be worth $12,602 in February, 2021, according to this formula. 
Right now, that $10,000 investment would be down to $8,326. But that $8,326 is now expected to appreciate at a 4.3 percent annual rate. That makes its expected value $12,465 as of February, 2021 -- barely any lower than before.
Or ... maybe not. Disclosure: I'm not an especially active investor, although I do have some money in mutual funds and put my money where my mouth is, having pulled a lot of it out in late 2009 when formulas like Mr. Shiller's suggested that stocks did not represent an especially good value.
But this is a familiar debate in the economics literature. Some economists contend that there is not statistically robust evidence of mean-reversion in stock prices at all, and that its appearance could instead reflect purely random patterns. 
I tend not to find their arguments entirely persuasive. Stock prices fairly clearly exhibit some nonrandom behavior. For instance, S&P 500 prices have tended to move in the same direction from month to month. Since 1871, a month in which the S&P 500 gains value relative to inflation has been followed by another winning month 63 percent of the time, whereas a loss has been followed by another loss 53 percent of the time.
However, there is also a lot of debate about just how strong the mean reversion tendency might be. Some studies put the "half-life" of stock losses at around 2.5 years (meaning, if you lost $10,000, you'd get half of that back in just 30 months). This would imply that, over a 10-year time horizon, you'd recover in excess of 90 percent of any losses suffered during a downturn -- the normal long-run appreciation from stocks. But another study puts the half-life of stock shocks at 18.5 years, which means that you'd only get about 30 percent of your losses back over a 10-year interval.
What all of these studies agree on is that the effects become stronger the longer your investment horizon. If you need to pull your money out in a year for retirement, these effects are weak to nonexistent and unfortunately will not really help you at all. If you don't need that money for 5 years, though, they should provide you with at least a little comfort. And if you're looking 10 or especially 20 years out, your long-term outlook may be affected much less than you might think by the recent market action.
Or there's the nightmare scenario. The Japanese stock market, the Nikkei 225, is worth no more today than it was 25 years ago. That case, for now, still looks like an outlier for a developed country. But stocks do entail some risk -- that's why they provide a reward.

HIGHLIGHT: The sell-off seems to have stopped, at least for now.

 BODY:
The great sell-off may be taking pause.
About two hours before the New York opening, Dow futures are up about 150 points and S.&P. futures show similar gains.
In Asia today, afternoon trading raised prices and China's market even ended up for the day. Japan, off 4.7 percent at its lunch break, ended the day having recovered two-thirds of the fall. 
European indexes are lower for the day, but turned up around 4:30 a.m. New York time. The FTSE 100 in London fell below 4,800 points before it began to recover, but is now over 5,000.
What remains to be seen is whether there will actually be buyers for shares when trading opens in New York. Phil Roth, a longtime market watcher with Miller Tabak, says there is little evidence that either individual investors or traditional money managers are putting in money, so buying by hedge funds may be needed.
