HEADLINE: Rumsfeld Warns Young Chinese on Isolationism

BYLINE: By THOM SHANKER

DATELINE: BEIJING, Wednesday, Oct. 19 

 BODY:
Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld urged the next generation of China's Communist leadership on Wednesday to become ''a major player'' in the global economy by taking steps to strengthen the system and not just reap the financial rewards, and he warned against erecting ''another type of Great Wall'' restricting free expression and choice.
 In a speech to mid-career Communist Party officials preparing for senior leadership positions, Mr. Rumsfeld also criticized Beijing's military expansion, saying it had prompted ''questions whether China will make the right choices -- choices that will serve the world's real interests in regional peace and stability.''
Mr. Rumsfeld delivered carefully phrased comments that balanced an invitation to build a political, economic and security partnership with the United States against a complaint that China hides its increases in military spending and has not explained a worrisome arms buildup. 
 The chance to deliver the message to the Central Party School, which serves as the Communist Party's ideological research institute and as the main training program for cadres slated for senior posts, was requested by the Pentagon, clearly indicating that Mr. Rumsfeld wanted these future leaders to hear a senior American official say that China's future remains undetermined and that the course of this Asian giant is in their hands.
 ''Every society has to be vigilant against another type of Great Wall that can be a burden on man's talents and is born from a fear of them -- a wall that limits speech, information and choices,'' Mr. Rumsfeld said.
 The secretary said history proved that it is impossible to isolate any population forever and that information seeps through. ''And when those inside that wall glean insights about the world that they discover are notably different from what they have been taught and led to believe, the effect can prove dramatic,'' he cautioned.
 Beijing still may stumble as it steps up to a larger role in global affairs because of its military expansion, Mr. Rumsfeld said, and ''a growth in China's power-projection understandably leads other nations to question China's intentions -- and to adjust their behavior in some fashion.''
 Despite this grim reminder, Mr. Rumsfeld's comments struck a tone noticeably less severe than did his June address on Asian security, delivered in Singapore, which was criticized by Chinese delegates as an attack on Beijing's right to defend its national interests.
 In many ways, Mr. Rumsfeld personifies the United States-China relationship, which he described as ''a complex one, with its share of challenges.''
 While the secretary has been the Bush administration's most energetic member in sounding the alarm over Chinese military power, he also once placed a personal bet on the growth of the Chinese economy and on its important role in global finance. Personal disclosure forms filed in 2001 after his nomination as President Bush's defense secretary showed that Mr. Rumsfeld once invested as much as $500,000 in a venture capital fund in Shanghai that focused on China's budding Internet market.
 ''China, with its rapid economic growth and many new trading partners, is a major player in that multinational system and, as such, must increasingly take a share of responsibility for the international system's health and success,'' he said. ''Indeed, in an era of increasing globalization, threats such as nuclear proliferation, terrorism and infectious diseases are transnational in nature, and require cooperative efforts.''
 But he criticized any move by China within that multinational framework to create regional institutions that exclude other Pacific Rim countries -- especially the United States.
 During his visit to China, which comes ahead of a trip here by Mr. Bush next month, Mr. Rumsfeld is to meet with President Hu Jintao and the nation's defense minister, Gen. Cao Gangchuan.
 Coverage of the American's visit in the Chinese news media has included special sections headlined, ''Rumsfeld Visits China.'' Articles so far included biographical sketches, with descriptions of his college wrestling career, and statements like, ''During the cold war, he was a cold-blooded soldier; now he makes the American military plan.''
 Mr. Rumsfeld's staff had requested that he be allowed to visit the Western Hills military complex outside Beijing, described as China's Pentagon, but the request was denied by the Chinese government. ''It tells something about them,'' he said of the decision.
 Mr. Rumsfeld, who first visited China in 1974 while serving as chief of staff to former President Gerald R. Ford, is nonetheless scheduled to be the first American defense secretary to visit the headquarters of China's strategic missile fleet, later Wednesday. 
 In comments en route to Beijing, Mr. Rumsfeld said he would probably have visited China sooner in his current job had military-to-military ties not been ruptured by the collision between a Navy surveillance plane and a Chinese fighter jet on April 1, 2001, in international airspace over the South China Sea. The crash caused the death of a Chinese pilot and the detention of the 24-member American crew for 11 days after the aircraft made an emergency landing on Hainan Island.
 Chinese officials are no doubt waiting to see whether the messages Mr. Rumsfeld delivers here are the same ones he delivered long-distance at the Singapore conference, when he sternly warned Beijing that its military spending was viewed as threatening a delicate security balance.

HEADLINE: Regaining Control of Our Borders

 BODY:

To the Editor:
 Your editorial mentioned that illegal immigrants would have to pay a $2,000 fine under the proposed legislative solution to the problem. I don't think that the immigrants should have to pay anything. The problem would be fixed in a minute if the employers of illegal immigrants were sought out and heavily fined. 
 Also, the editorial said that immigrants were doing jobs that Americans don't want. This is a myth. Again, if employers paid fair wages, Americans would take the jobs.
 There is an elitism in this country that promotes the idea that manual labor is beneath the status of Americans. This idea has undermined the economic status of people who have the inclination and the talent to work with their hands. Not everyone wants to be a knowledge worker.
 The third action that would solve the flood of immigrants to the United States would be for the labor unions to organize internationally, so that the global economy would treat labor fairly. The United States should provide tax incentives (or tax penalties for unfair payment of labor) to employers who pay labor fairly whether in or outside the United States.

HEADLINE: Holiday Shopping Before the First Heating Bill

BYLINE: By STUART ELLIOTT; Michael Barbaro contributed reporting for this article.

 BODY:
High fuel prices have the Christmas shopping season off and running -- weeks before trick-or-treaters have rung their first doorbells.
 Advertisers, marketers and retailers, worried that fuel prices will crimp spending on holiday shopping later this fall, are moving up their Christmas pitches. Consumers who believe it is not October, but rather November or even December have good reason to be confused.
''It's not just getting an earlier start on the Christmas season, it's getting to shoppers before they see their first heating bills, while the weather is still good,'' said Candace Corlett, a principal at WSL Strategic Retail, a consulting company in New York. 
 ''The smartest thing a retailer can do is get consumers to buy now, because they have the cash now,'' she said. ''Not only is there the fear of higher fuel prices later, but if we're hit with a very cold November or December, that would really scare shoppers.''
 Television commercials extolling the virtues of giving gifts of trips on Carnival Cruise Lines ships started appearing Oct. 9, during the baseball playoffs. The home page of the Web site of the Bath and Body Works retail chain, part of Limited Brands, is already crammed with silver snow globes and red tree ornaments, and proclaims, ''Get ready for the perfect Christmas.''
 Since Oct. 10, Expedia has been enticing consumers to book holiday trips early with ads featuring humorous ''sanity cards,'' which offer travel discounts. A Gymboree store on the Upper West Side of Manhattan, part of the children's clothing chain, has a window poster that reads, ''We wish you a merry family.''
 Ms. Corlett walked through the Marshall Field's department store on State Street in downtown Chicago on Monday, and said she saw mark-down prices on holiday merchandise like candles and chocolates.
 The Labor Department reported yesterday that energy costs at the wholesale level climbed 7.1 percent last month, compared with September 2004, contributing to a 1.9 percent increase in the Producer Price Index. That was the fastest one-month increase in the index in almost 16 years. 
 ''A penny on the price of gas is $8 million to our bottom line,'' said Azeezaly S. Jaffer, vice president at the United States Postal Service in Washington, which is encouraging consumers to mail early by starting its pre-holiday ads early.
 The Postal Service's holiday mailing guide is to be sent to 110 million to 120 million addresses around Nov. 1, Mr. Jaffer said, about two weeks earlier than it was mailed last year. The booklet is being created by Campbell-Ewald in Warren, Mich., part of the Interpublic Group of Companies.
 A full 28 percent of online retailers said they would begin holiday marketing campaigns earlier this year than in 2004, according to Shop.org, the online arm of the National Retail Federation. Nearly half of the 119 companies surveyed said they would start by the end of this week, Shop.org reported. 
 ''Fuel prices are rising, so this is a great year for people to book early and lock in those lower rates,'' said Kari Swartz, product manager for leisure travel at Expedia in Bellevue, Wash.
 And ''to get people to do it a little earlier than they might normally think about it,'' she added, the company -- which arranges online flights, hotel rooms and car rentals -- is offering customers who book holiday travel by Dec. 9 a discount of $150 on vacation trips taken in 2006. TV commercials and newspaper ads by Deutsch in New York, part of Interpublic, describe the Expedia promotion.
 A competitor, Travelocity.com, owned by Sabre Holdings, is running a similar promotion. Ads by McKinney & Silver in Durham, N.C., part of Havas, show the Travelocity gnome character festooned with Christmas lights. Orbitz, which competes with both companies, also plans to start its holiday promotions earlier than last year, with discount offers on its Web site (www.orbitz.com) and in e-mail messages to customers. 
 ''Christmas comes earlier each year,'' said Randy Wagner, chief marketing officer at Orbitz in Chicago, owned by the Cendant Corporation. ''As retailing is moving the holiday forward, people are getting into an early gift-giving mode.''
 Decades ago, it was almost unheard-of for the trappings of the holiday shopping season to emerge before Thanksgiving. More recently, as the importance of strong Christmas sales grew for retailers and marketers -- they can make up to two-thirds of their annual profit in the weeks leading up to the holiday -- Christmas-themed ads, music and decorations began turning up around Halloween.
 But to have them appear two or three weeks before Oct. 31 is especially early.
 ''We've never done this before,'' said Christine Arnholt, vice president for marketing services at Carnival in Miami, referring to her company's October holiday ads. ''But we've gotten overwhelmingly positive feedback.''
 In the first week of October, telephone calls to Carnival and traffic to its Web site (carnival.com) were ''up significantly, north of 20 percent'' compared with the same week a year ago, Ms. Arnholt said. Television and print ads by Cooper DDB in Coral Gables, Fla., part of the DDB Worldwide division of the Omnicom Group, are centered on models of Carnival cruise ships wrapped in red gift ribbons and bows; the commercials add jingling bells to the Carnival theme song, ''Beyond the Sea.''
 The early jump on Christmas on the sales floors of stores extends beyond Marshall Field's, now part of Federated Department Stores. A popular retailer of clothing aimed at teenagers, Abercrombie & Fitch, will start to display holiday-season merchandise a week earlier than last year, said John D. Morris, an analyst at Harris Nesbitt, who closely tracks Christmas retailing.
 Retailers ''want to put their best foot forward in the face of a challenging environment,'' Mr. Morris said.
 And a special Eddie Bauer store in Midtown Manhattan selling down apparel, which is to be open only for the holiday shopping season, greeted its first customers on Monday. The company is calling the store, on the concourse level in Rockefeller Center, the Down Boutique; the merchandise ranges from jackets to gloves to dog coats.
 ''Our customer tends to be pretty resistant'' to the ups and downs of the economy, fueled by factors like high gasoline prices, said David Makuen, vice president for marketing at Eddie Bauer in Redmond, Wash.
 Even so, he added, ''we wouldn't mind them buying early.''

HEADLINE: Europeans Block French Move To Limit Global Trade Talks

BYLINE: By TOM WRIGHT; Brian Knowlton of The International Herald Tribune contributed reporting from Washington for this article.; International Herald Tribune

DATELINE: LUXEMBOURG, Oct. 18 

 BODY:
European foreign ministers rejected a French proposal on Tuesday to rein in the negotiating authority of Peter Mandelson, the European Union trade commissioner, keeping alive for now hopes of reaching a global trade agreement. 
 The French foreign minister, Philippe Douste-Blazy, had sought to force Mr. Mandelson to seek approval from the union's 25 nations before making any fresh offers at the trade negotiations, which resume Wednesday in Geneva.
France was upset by Mr. Mandelson's proposal last week for deeper cuts in European farm subsidies. But on Tuesday, it won support only from countries with large parts of their economy devoted to agriculture, like Greece and Ireland. Germany, which has often been sympathetic to French views, declined to give its backing. 
 ''There was no consensus for that proposal,'' said Jack Straw, Britain's foreign secretary, who presided at a special meeting of the ministers here. ''It frankly would make negotiations impossible and render your negotiators powerless.'' 
 France's proposal would effectively have torpedoed talks with the United States weeks before an important World Trade Organization meeting in December, specialists said. 
 ''Victory is too big a word,'' said Jean-Pierre Lehmann, director of the Evian Group, a free trade advocacy group based in Switzerland. ''But it's encouraging for Mandelson.''
 The United States gave impetus to the negotiations last week by offering to cut its farm subsidies 60 percent. In return, Mr. Mandelson offered a 70 percent cut in European subsidies -- up from a previous offer of 65 percent -- leading to French complaints that he had overstepped his authority. 
 By reaffirming Mr. Mandelson's mandate, the European ministers underlined their commitment to forging a compromise with the United States and with developing nations over farm aid -- a sticking point in the trade talks. 
 They agreed that the European Commission, the year-round administrative arm of the European Union, should report more regularly on the trade negotiations, given their sensitivity. And they backed a plan for independent studies on the social impact of any farm policy changes. 
 Mr. Mandelson struck a conciliatory tone, saying he would agree to farm policy changes only if large developing nations like China and Brazil opened their markets to Western goods and services. 
 But he warned the foreign ministers that shutting the door to further talks on agriculture could sabotage the current round of trade negotiations, which began in 2001 in Doha, Qatar. There has been little progress in the talks as a result of the wrangling over agricultural subsidies, which developing countries say hurt their farmers by encouraging overproduction and depressing world commodity prices. 
 ''Surely it would be the wrong reaction,'' Mr. Mandelson said, ''and a terrible mistake for the E.U., at the first sign of serious movement in the talks -- movement that we had been calling for -- to lose confidence and pull in the horns.'' 
 In Washington on Tuesday, President Bush met with Jose Manuel Barroso, the European Commission president, and both offered strong backing to efforts to unblock trade negotiations.
 Referring to the talks, Mr. Bush said, ''There's no question we share the same objective.'' Mr. Barroso noted that with $1 billion in trade a day, ''we have a common interest in opening up markets.''
 As negotiations progress, Mr. Mandelson will have to balance a growing division between mainly southern European nations that support the current arrangement -- under which the European Union pays about $60 billion annually to farmers -- and nations like Britain, Norway and Sweden that back subsidy cuts. 
 Besides a reduction in subsidies, the United States wants the Europeans to sharply reduce the tariffs they impose on farm imports. The talks in Geneva starting Wednesday among representatives from the United States, the European Union, India, Brazil and Australia are expected to focus on this matter. 
 The United States trade representative, Rob Portman, in a BBC interview Tuesday, urged the Europeans to ''do the right thing'' by agreeing to big tariff reductions. The United States has much lower tariffs on farm imports than Europe does.

HEADLINE: Mayor's Demand for Productivity Yields Tension, Then Contracts 

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE

 BODY:
Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg came into office with an unusual message for the city's 300,000 workers -- they would not get raises unless their unions agreed to money-saving measures that paid for their wage increases.
 Facing intense pressure from the city's unions, Mr. Bloomberg has given way somewhat on that demand, but, labor experts say, he has nonetheless wrung more productivity increases and other concessions out of the unions than previous mayors have.
Mr. Bloomberg pressured the teachers' union into adding two days to the school year and 10 minutes to the average school day. The Patrolmen's Benevolent Association has accepted a lower starting salary and relinquished one personal day. And last week the sanitation union agreed to one-person garbage trucks and longer collection routes. 
 ''What Mayor Bloomberg has done in terms of productivity is less than the standard he set for himself, but he has done more than his predecessors,'' said Charles M. Brecher, research director for the Citizens Budget Commission.
 The push on productivity has worsened relations with the unions. Labor negotiations no longer focus just on how much more the city can pay; now they also focus on how each union's members can become more productive to help the city save money.
 In exchange for such concessions, some unions have obtained impressive raises. The city's 80,000 teachers are to receive a 15 percent raise over 52 months under their proposed contract, while the sanitation workers' settlement calls for a 17 percent raise over 51 months. The police contract includes a 10.25 percent raise over two years.
 ''The mayor has always been very strong in saying that workers should be paid more,'' said Marc V. Shaw, the deputy mayor for operations. ''We just need to find ways to pay them more. Given the fiscal realities, the only way to do that is to focus on productivity.''
 Not everyone is heaping praise on Mr. Bloomberg's productivity-based bargaining. 
 Some urban affairs experts note that Mr. Bloomberg has failed to meet his standard that workers pay for every cent of their raises through productivity increases. Some experts also say he has been too generous, putting the city's long-term fiscal health at risk by not demanding major concessions on costly expenses like health coverage, as private corporations have.
 ''I don't think the city can afford the police contract, and I'm not sure about the teachers' contract, either,'' said Fred Siegel, a history professor at Cooper Union and author of ''The Prince of the City,'' about Rudolph W. Giuliani's years as mayor. ''Just as we see that Giuliani did a bad job fiscally in his last two years, we may judge Bloomberg very differently if the city's budget goes over the cliff.''
 For their part, the unions said the mayor's demands for productivity increases have hurt labor relations. 
 Randi Weingarten, president of the United Federation of Teachers, complained that many city workers received no raises for two years or more because some unions waited two, even three years after their contracts expired to negotiate new ones. For many unions, contract talks bogged down for a year or two after Mr. Bloomberg told labor leaders that no deal was possible until they put forward money-saving suggestions. 
 ''His approach has really hurt the morale of the work force,'' Ms. Weingarten said. ''We've all been put into a terrible situation because Bloomberg has demanded the kinds of productivity increases that are difficult for anybody to try to create.''
 The fiercest objection to Mr. Bloomberg's approach is that the mayor, in pushing relentlessly for savings, got several unions to accept lower starting salaries. For police officers, starting pay has fallen to $25,100, down from the old starting salary of $34,514, a decrease that city and union officials fear could create recruiting problems.
 ''He's created problems for tomorrow by paying a substandard salary in the beginning for police officers,'' said Patrick J. Lynch, president of the Patrolmen's Benevolent Association. ''A lot of people aren't going to want to come to the job at that rate.''
 At first Mr. Bloomberg took what appeared to be a velvet-glove approach with the city's unions. He held photo sessions with union presidents, he heaped praise on municipal workers, and he erased a $2 billion budget deficit not by laying off thousands of workers, but by raising property taxes. 
 Despite those friendly overtures to labor, Mr. Bloomberg showed how tough he could be in the first major contract negotiated in bargaining that started after he took office. It was with the largest municipal union, District Council 37, and called for a raise of just 5 percent over three years. To the dismay of many labor leaders, that contract, by city tradition, was to set the pattern for other municipal unions.
 Signed in April 2004, it covered 121,000 union members and averaged less than 2 percent annually, less than the inflation rate. Mr. Bloomberg warned other unions that if they wanted more than District Council 37, they needed to agree to money-saving concessions.
 The District Council 37 settlement contained some important concessions, including a wage freeze in the first year and a lower starting salary for workers during their first two years on the job.
 Many union leaders complained that Mr. Bloomberg had outmaneuvered District Council 37 and left them with a paltry wage pattern.
 ''I think our contract was fair at the time we did it,'' said Lillian Roberts, District Council 37 executive director. ''We did it after 9/11, which was a very difficult time for the city.''
 But Barry Liebowitz, president of the Doctors Council, which represents 1,200 doctors at the city's public hospitals, spoke for most union leaders when he said, ''The pattern set by D.C. 37 was not the best situation for any union that came afterward.''
 The doctors ultimately agreed to increase their workday by 30 minutes, to 8 hours, and in return the city gave them raises of 10 percent over three years, more than District Council 37 got.
 When Mr. Bloomberg told the police and teachers' unions that they could expect no more than District Council 37's 5 percent unless they agreed to cost savings, those unions' leaders grew angry. They called his offer an insult, especially his demand for a one-year pay freeze.
 ''The city's bargaining approach was unfair,'' said Mr. Lynch of the police union. ''Their negotiating style is they put draconian steps on the table that no one can touch.'' 
 The police contract dispute was settled in June when an arbitration panel issued a binding decision calling for a 10.25 percent raise over two years. Mindful of the District Council 37 pattern, the panel ordered several significant money-saving concessions, including the lower starting salary. 
 The contract dispute with the teachers also grew testy; there were two years of on-again, off-again talks, and the teachers eventually held protest rallies. After an arbitration panel made a nonbinding recommendation, the city and the teachers reached a settlement on Oct. 3.
 The 52-month deal, which awaits a ratification vote, included an impressive 15 percent raise and numerous union concessions in exchange for the higher pay. Those concessions including a longer school day, a longer school year and an end to a system that allowed teachers to bump colleagues in other schools with less seniority. 
 ''It is a winner for both sides,'' Mr. Bloomberg said in announcing the deal.
 Many teachers denounced the deal, though, saying they deserved a large raise without having to make concessions.
 Probably the best laboratory for Mr. Bloomberg's call for heightened productivity was the negotiations with the Uniformed Sanitationmen's Union. That union has a history of exchanging productivity increases for higher pay, having agreed in 1980 to cut back to two workers on a truck from three. 
 Last Wednesday, Mr. Bloomberg and the sanitation union agreed to a 17 percent increase over 51 months, the highest raise in the current round of bargaining. That raise was made possible through far-reaching productivity measures. The union agreed to one-person trucks to pick up large, roll-on metal bins, and trash routes will be lengthened so that crews collect more tonnage.
 ''The trick of this contract was you had to generate your own wage increases,'' said Harry Nespoli, president of the sanitation union, which represents 6,600 workers. The productivity measures will enable the Sanitation Department to reduce its payroll by 200 workers through attrition.
 James F. Hanley, the city's longtime labor commissioner, said Mr. Bloomberg's strategy had paid off. 
 ''Every deal that we have cut so far has had a productivity component with internal savings,'' he said. ''The message is clear from the mayor -- if you're willing to come to the table and be flexible and creative and come up with some savings, you can get a terrific deal.''
 Some unions are angry because they remain without contracts. Most notable are the Uniformed Firefighters Association and the Professional Staff Congress, representing City University teachers.
 ''In a kind of nonbelligerent way, he has taken a very hard line, and his insistence on productivity givebacks has made labor relations very, very difficult,'' said Joshua B. Freeman, a labor historian at the City University Graduate Center.
 Some urban affairs experts see little reason for municipal workers to complain about Mr. Bloomberg. 
 ''He took office with a major budget gap, and there haven't been layoffs and everyone has been getting pay increases above inflation,'' said E.J. McMahon, director of the Empire Center for New York State Policy at the Manhattan Institute. 
 He criticized the mayor for doing little to restrain fast-rising health and pensions costs.
 ''I don't think he's done enough to press them for concessions on benefits,'' Mr. McMahon said.
 Long before Mr. Bloomberg was elected, the Citizens Budget Commission asserted that city employees deserved to earn considerably more, but it argued that higher pay should be financed through measures guaranteeing higher productivity.
 ''People used to look at us like we're crazy for saying that,'' said Mr. Brecher, the group's research director. ''Now it's accepted that that's how it's going to be.''

HEADLINE: Bush Renews Push for Immigrant-Worker Plan

BYLINE: By ELISABETH BUMILLER and ERIC LIPTON

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 18 

 BODY:
President Bush vowed on Tuesday to get tough on illegal immigrants even as he urged Congress to adopt a temporary-worker program that would allow some to remain in the United States for as long as six years.
 ''We're going to get control of our borders,'' Mr. Bush said in the White House East Room just before signing a $32 billion domestic security bill that has big increases for the Border Patrol, including money for 1,000 new agents and improved technology. ''We'll make this country safer for all our citizens.'' 
Mr. Bush added, ''If somebody is here illegally, we've got to do everything we can to find them.'' Once illegal immigrants are caught, he said, they must be ''returned to their home countries as soon as possible.''
 Mr. Bush's words, among his most insistent on illegal immigrants to date, were intended to calm conservatives upset at his temporary-worker plan, which a number of Republicans view as an amnesty program. Mr. Bush first proposed the plan in January 2004, but it has run into resistance.
 In a renewed effort to win support, the White House is now emphasizing the border enforcement part of the plan, but at the same time insisting that enforcement can work only as a part of what Mr. Bush on Tuesday called ''a larger, comprehensive immigration reform program.''
 Similar sentiments were voiced earlier in the day by Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff and Labor Secretary Elaine L. Chao, who told the Senate Judiciary Committee that increasing enforcement along the nation's borders would not alone repair the nation's immigration system. They urged the adoption of a temporary-worker program.
 ''This is a system desperately in need of repair,'' Mr. Chertoff said. ''And the fact of the matter is people are rightly upset and distressed about the prospect that we do not have control of our border the way we should.''
 Under the plan proposed by Mr. Bush, certain illegal immigrants already in the United States would pay a fee and then be given a temporary worker visa good for up to three years, with an option to renew it for three more. After the six years, they would have to leave the country, Ms. Chao said. A worker would need to apply for the program with an employer as a sponsor if the employer had a job that no American could be found to take.
 ''By addressing the economic forces that drive immigration, we can meet employers' need for workers, provide appropriate legal channels for foreign-born workers to access opportunity and allow enforcement resources to be targeted on the critical mission of border security,'' Ms. Chao said.
 Mr. Bush, who was immersed in immigration issues as governor of Texas and has promoted his plan in part as an appeal to politically important Hispanic voters, cast the problem from the point of view of illegal immigrants themselves.
 ''You see, we got people sneaking into our country to work,'' he said. ''They want to provide for their families. Family values do not stop at the Rio Grande River. People are coming to put food on the table. But because there is no legal way for them to do so, through a temporary-worker program, they're putting pressure on our border.''
 But even as Mr. Bush and his two cabinet members made their pitches, members of both parties were questioning the president's plan.
 Senator Tom Coburn, Republican of Oklahoma, asked Mr. Chertoff how the administration could enforce the requirement that temporary workers leave after six years.
 Senator Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California, said the talk of such a temporary-worker program was spurring even more illegal immigration to the United States.
 Other Democrats, including Senator Richard J. Durbin of Illinois, pressed Ms. Chao about why the Bush administration program did not simply offer a way for illegal immigrants to become permanent legal residents.
 And Senator Jeff Sessions, Republican of Alabama, said that at least for now, the administration should first prove that it could improve enforcement of the borders, where more than one million people were apprehended in the last fiscal year trying to cross illegally.
 ''Are you going to get busy now to enforce existing law?'' Mr. Sessions asked.
 Mr. Chertoff said that the Homeland Security Department, which includes Immigration and Customs and Enforcement as well as the Border Patrol, was not waiting for a temporary-worker program.
 The department, for example, is moving to finish work on a border fence near San Diego, hiring the 1,000 additional Border Patrol officers provided for in the measure signed by Mr. Bush and looking for ways to accelerate the deportation of illegal immigrants.
 The law also includes money for more than 1,900 additional beds in detention centers, bringing the total to nearly 20,000. In addition, it provides $139 million to improve border technology and intelligence capabilities, $82 million to improve and expand Border Patrol stations, and $70 million to install and improve border fencing, lighting and roads.
 In his remarks to the Judiciary Committee, Mr. Chertoff repeated that the effort would be hampered if Congress did not help the administration reduce the incentive for people to enter illegally.
 ''It's a three-legged stool,'' Mr. Chertoff said. ''It requires tough enforcement at the border, tough interior enforcement and a temporary-worker program to deal with the very real draw.''

HEADLINE: Nominee's Financial Disclosures Show Worth of Less Than $1 Million

BYLINE: By GLEN JUSTICE

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 18 

 BODY:
Harriet E. Miers worked as a corporate lawyer in Texas for years before serving in a high-ranking White House job, but she never vaulted into the ranks of the superrich. 
 Ms. Miers, President Bush's nominee for the Supreme Court, disclosed about $1.3 million in personal assets this week. They have been diminished in part over the years by large donations to her church, the costs of caring for her elderly mother and working for a government salary since 2001, according to interviews with friends, colleagues and administration officials. 
''She's driven a Mercedes as long as I've known her, so she's not a pauper,'' said Steve Bartlett, a former Republican congressman from Texas who has known Ms. Miers for years. ''But it has always been a used Mercedes.''
 Many who leave the private sector for top government posts arrive in Washington with millions of dollars. Mr. Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney are both wealthy, as are many cabinet secretaries, lawmakers and Supreme Court justices. 
 If confirmed for the court seat, Ms. Miers, currently the White House counsel, would rank near the bottom of the justices in terms of wealth, surpassing only Anthony M. Kennedy and Clarence Thomas. She reported her net worth was about $675,000, according to filings with Congress this week. Her $1.3 million in assets consist primarily of a house in Dallas valued at $688,000 and a condominium in Arlington, Va., worth roughly $295,000. Ms. Miers also listed about $223,000 in investments, and loans, mostly mortgages, totaling $573,000. 
 Her holdings are worth little more today than they were when she arrived in Washington. When Ms. Miers joined the administration in 2001, her disclosures stated that she held assets worth $550,000 to $1.1 million, not counting real estate.
 ''Money was not her highest priority,'' said Michael M. Boone, a founder of the Haynes & Boone law firm in Texas and a Bush fund-raiser. 
 As president of Locke Liddell & Sapp, a well-known Dallas law firm, Ms. Miers was paid $577,000 in 2000, the last full year she worked there, administration officials said. Her move to Washington came with a pay cut, as Ms. Miers makes $161,000 a year at the White House. Her salary will grow to $199,200 if she is confirmed. 
 While some say Ms. Miers might be expected to have more money given her legal career, others are not surprised at her situation. ''She's a cause person,'' Mr. Bartlett said. ''Sometimes, people who do that don't accumulate personal wealth.'' 
 Officials at Valley View Christian Church, which Ms. Miers attended in Dallas starting in the 1980's, said she regularly donated at least 10 percent of her salary. She also gave money to other religious organizations she worked with.
 ''She has certainly been very supportive of the concept of tithing,'' said the Rev. Barry McCarty, preaching minister at her church. ''She's been a regular giver to our congregation, as well as other causes.''
 Ms. Miers has also paid the costs of caring for her 91-year-old mother, Sally, who lives in a nursing home in Dallas, administration officials said. 
 At 60, Ms. Miers has favored conservative investments, shunning large bets on the stock market. Financial analysts say it is a predictable move for someone who did not grow up wealthy. 
 ''Some people just like to sleep well at night,'' said Greg Valliere, chief strategist at Stanford Washington Research Group, which analyzes economic data for institutional investors. ''It's not real profitable, but you do sleep well.''

HEADLINE: Is Affordable Housing Becoming an Oxymoron?

BYLINE: By Hal R. Varian; Hal R. Varian is a professor of business, economics and information management at the University of California, Berkeley.

 BODY:
TO paraphrase Yogi Berra, it seems that houses are now so expensive that no one can afford to own one.
 Of course, economists know better. In the short run, the supply of housing in most areas is more or less fixed. Hence the price of housing is determined primarily by the demand side of the market -- by how much people are willing to pay for housing. 
In the last few years, we have seen historically low mortgage rates, which feed directly into housing demand. In several locations, particularly on the East and West Coasts, where land-use restrictions make it difficult to increase the supply of housing, prices have been pushed up to unprecedented levels. 
 Whether these low mortgage rates have created a housing price bubble has been a matter of debate. There is no universally accepted definition of a ''bubble'' in economics, but the idea is that a significant part of the demand for housing is based on an expectation of future appreciation. The more prices go up, the more people want to buy so as to reap the gains from expected future price appreciation, pushing prices up even more.
 It is quite possible that there is some ''froth'' in the market, to use Alan Greenspan's term, particularly on the coasts. But even when the froth subsides, housing will remain quite expensive in those areas. Can anything be done?
 Some municipalities have started subsidized housing programs that provide various types of assistance to new homeowners. Unfortunately, such programs just increase demand even more, pushing prices up. In fact, in an ideal market with a constant supply of housing, a 10 percent subsidy offered to a broad segment of the market would simply push housing prices up by 10 percent. The out-of-pocket, after-subsidy price would end up right where it started.
 If you really wanted to push housing prices down, you would increase taxes on housing. Analogous to the imposition of a subsidy, a 10 percent increase in property taxes would push housing prices down by 10 percent. Of course, the total cost of the housing (purchase price plus the present value of the taxes) would be unchanged, so this really does not solve the housing cost problem either.
 In California, tax policy has played a significant role in housing price dynamics. Proposition 13, passed in 1978, limited property tax increases to 2 percent a year for owner-occupied homes. But when the house is sold, the property tax assessment is based on the sale price. This means the new owner typically faces a significantly higher property tax bill than the old owner.
 Proposition 13 has been called a ''tax on moving.'' Indeed it is, since a homeowner in California is much better off remodeling than moving. It is a lot cheaper to add a bedroom to a three-bedroom house than to buy a similar four-bedroom house because of the tax treatment of renovations as compared with new sales. For the same reason, empty-nesters have strong tax incentives to keep their houses, regardless of whether they need all that space.
 The result is that fewer houses come on the market than would otherwise be the case, pushing prices up even more for the limited stock of housing that is available.
 Of course, if you intend to move out of state, these considerations are not so relevant. In California, the best thing for empty-nesters to do is to sell their nests and migrate to Oregon. This seems to have become a pretty common practice, at least in some demographic groups. 
 So what is the answer to high home prices? Basic economics tells us that for housing prices to fall we have to see a reduction in demand or an increase in the supply of housing. 
 There is some hope on the demand side. As interest rates rise, we should see some moderation in demand; indeed, it appears that housing prices are flattening out in some areas. 
 Ultimately, the only reliable way to make housing more affordable is to increase the supply. But a new house requires land zoned for housing. We cannot make more land, so we either have to use the land we have more intensively or we have to build houses farther from jobs. Both of these options are unattractive. 
 In urban California, traffic has become increasingly congested, putting a limit on how far away from their jobs people can live. Land use restrictions are tight in many desirable residential areas, and political forces are aligned against relaxing these restrictions.
 Imagine someone who scrimps and saves to buy his dream house in an area zoned for one-acre lots. The last thing he wants to see is his neighbor's lot being subdivided to build two or three new houses. Not only would it affect his quality of life, but, even more important, it would also affect the value of his house.
 Zoning laws and land use restrictions are unpopular among those seeking less-costly housing since they push up the price. But by the same token, once a searcher becomes an owner, he often becomes a fervent supporter of such restrictions. As Pogo put it, ''We have met the enemy and he is us.''

CORRECTION-DATE: October 26, 2005

 CORRECTION:
The Economic Scene column in Business Day on Thursday, about the high cost of housing, referred incorrectly to a tax that might be one way of controlling prices. It is a 10 percent tax on housing values, which would theoretically push prices down 10 percent -- not a 10 percent increase in property taxes (which are typically a small fraction of a house's value).

HEADLINE: Repeated Defect in Heart Devices Exposes a History of Problems 

BYLINE: By BARRY MEIER

 BODY:
It was March in the high desert West but the day felt more like early summer -- warm, bright and breezy -- as the young couple rode out on rented mountain bikes along a trail that ran through the majestic red rock canyons outside Moab, Utah.
 The two college students met only a few months earlier, in late 2004. But the couple, Jessica Lemieux and Joshua Oukrop, had talked in recent days about their lives together and marriage. ''I told him he had met his match,'' Ms. Lemieux recalled. ''That I had started finishing his sentences for him.''
It was one of the last things she told him. From behind, where Mr. Oukrop was riding, she heard him call out, ''Hold on, I need to'' When she turned, he was already falling backward, the bike tumbling on top of him. She pulled off his helmet. He gasped once, and then he stopped breathing. 
 Mr. Oukrop, a 21-year-old student who suffered from a genetic heart disease, died of sudden cardiac arrest even though a medical device known as a defibrillator had been implanted in his chest to protect him from potentially fatal heart rhythms. 
 His death set off a series of events that would expose flaws in how producers of critical heart devices disclose defects to doctors and patients. It also would reveal that the Food and Drug Administration's oversight of the fast-growing heart device industry is, at best, loose.
 Those disclosures have resulted in calls for change in how and when companies and the F.D.A. alert doctors about malfunctions and, in turn, what physicians tell patients. 
 Two months after Mr. Oukrop's death, the Guidant Corporation, the country's second-biggest maker of heart defibrillators, acknowledged that it had not told doctors for three years that one model had short-circuited in about two dozen cases, including the one involving him. 
 Guidant, which has said it did nothing wrong, has characterized the student's death as a tragic event. But it turns out that the same type of electrical defect that destroyed Mr. Oukrop's defibrillator also caused another heart device from Guidant to malfunction. 
 Short circuits involving that device, an advanced pacemaker that also contains a defibrillator, have been associated with the deaths of three patients. Guidant said recently that it was aware of 49 short-circuit reports involving both devices, out of a total of 42,000 units produced, a malfunction rate that the company has characterized as low.
 The devices' problems may be linked to Guidant's use of an insulating material that in some cases can deteriorate if exposed to moisture like body fluids. 
 Another device maker, Medtronic Inc., said it had stopped using the material, called polyimide (poly-IM-ed), in the 1990's when it changed how all its devices were made. Another company, St. Jude Medical, said it used polyimide only inside the sealed part of its heart devices, where the material was shielded from moisture.
 Executives of Guidant, who declined to be interviewed for this article, have said the company made all required reports to the F.D.A. about the devices, including malfunction reports. The agency is investigating the company; F.D.A. criminal investigators are involved in the inquiry. 
 Over the summer, Guidant, which is based in Indianapolis, issued recalls affecting tens of thousands of defibrillators and pacemakers, including the models that short-circuited.
 These events have played out amid the backdrop of a high-stakes business deal: Johnson & Johnson's announced in December 2004 that it would buy Guidant for $25.4 billion. Johnson & Johnson's target was Guidant's crown jewel: its heart device unit, which accounted last year for almost half of Guidant's total sales of $3.8 billion. 
 As a result of Guidant's recent problems, however, that deal may be renegotiated at a lower price or even unravel. 
 On Tuesday, Robert J. Darretta Jr., the vice chairman of Johnson & Johnson, said the company was considering its alternatives under the merger agreement. Yesterday, the chief executive of Guidant, Ronald W. Dollens, responded, stating that his company believed that the ''strategic rationale'' behind the deal had not changed.

Sounding the Alert
 In May, two months after Joshua Oukrop's death, four Guidant executives arrived at the Minneapolis Heart Institute, a cardiac center associated with Abbott Northwestern Hospital, a short drive from the suburb where the company's heart device division is based. There they met with one of Mr. Oukrop's doctors, Barry J. Maron, to explain what they had learned about the student's death and his defibrillator.
 Dr. Maron was not just any cardiologist. In 2000, the 64-year-old physician had published a landmark study that showed that defibrillators, long used in adults with heart problems, could also save children and young adults like Joshua Oukrop who were affected by a genetic disease, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, by interrupting the irregular heart rhythms the disease causes. 
 Since then, Dr. Maron, a large man with soft, rumpled features, has traveled the world like a medical missionary preaching greater use of the device and reassuring parents that their children, if they got a defibrillator, could lead normal lives. 
 While Joshua Oukrop's heart condition sidelined him from playing competitive sports, he could pursue outdoor activities like hiking and biking after his defibrillator was implanted in 2001. 
 Dr. Maron's world was shaken, however, back in March when a pathologist from the medical examiner's office in Salt Lake City called to tell him about the student's death. Nothing at the time suggested that the device had failed.
 ''I started to sweat bullets,'' he recalled recently. ''I started thinking this means that some of these kids can't be saved.'' 
 Soon, however, Dr. Maron would learn that it was not his research but Guidant's device that had apparently failed Mr. Oukrop.
 After a patient's death, it is rare for a defibrillator or pacemaker to be inspected because patients are typically elderly and their deaths are attributed to heart disease, rather than a device's malfunction. But Guidant engineers discovered the student's device had short-circuited while trying to send out a potentially life-saving jolt, though it was not clear when that occurred. 
 At their meeting in May, Guidant officials explained to Dr. Maron that the company knew of 25 other instances when the same model, the Prizm 2 DR, had also short-circuited. They also said the company had fixed the problem in April 2002, and that later units had not shorted.
 The trouble was that many of those earlier units were still in patients. Defibrillators can last five or six years before they must be replaced. The company later acknowledged that it had sold older units out of inventory after making an improved model. 
 Dr. Maron asked what the company planned to tell doctors. The medical director of the cardiac unit, Dr. Joseph M. Smith, replied that Guidant did not plan to tell them anything.
 Dr. Smith said that Guidant was concerned, given the small number of failures, that alerting physicians to the problem might cause them to remove devices unnecessarily, or lead frightened patients to demand their removal. The company believed that risks, like infection, associated with surgical replacements outweighed the risks posed by the device, Dr. Smith said.
 The meeting's tone remained cordial. But Dr. Maron had little doubt that given Mr. Oukrop's age and condition, he would have replaced his device. Now Dr. Smith was apparently saying that the company, even after Mr. Oukrop's death, would keep making that choice for other physicians.
 ''I told him that it sounds to me that this is going to be the biggest mistake that you are ever going to make,'' Dr. Maron said.
 A few days later, the Guidant executives made a similar presentation to another cardiologist at the Minneapolis heart institute, Dr. Robert G. Hauser. If they were hoping for a more sympathetic hearing, they were wrong.
 Dr. Hauser's roots were in the device industry and they even intertwined with Guidant's. For four years, starting in the late 1980's, he had been president of Cardiac Pacemakers Inc., which was then part of Eli Lilly & Company, the pharmaceutical company. In 1994, Lilly spun off Cardiac Pacemakers and four other subsidiaries to form the company that became Guidant. 
 More recently, Dr. Hauser, a wiry, dark-haired man of 66, had become an industry watchdog, creating a database into which hospitals reported device failures. In 2001, when he published an article about electrical failures in some Guidant models, company executives had reacted much as they were doing now with the Prizm 2 DR. They had said the problems were so rare they did not affect overall product safety. 
 Dr. Smith, the Guidant official, suggested that Dr. Hauser and the company collaborate on a medical journal article about the defibrillator. Later, Dr. Hauser went into Dr. Maron's office. 
 The physicians were in a quandary. Guidant had disclosed its problem to them. There was no way of knowing when the next device might fail. The next step was theirs. Dr. Maron picked up the telephone and called a reporter.

A Second Device
 In July, after Guidant had recalled the defibrillator and other heart devices, the head of the company's cardiac implant unit, J. Frederick McCoy Jr., made his views clear. 
 Company engineers, he explained in a newspaper interview, had promptly identified and fixed the Prizm 2 DR's electrical defect in April 2002. He added that Guidant saw no reason at the time to recall the model or stop selling older units because so few had short-circuited.
 ''It is only with the benefit of hindsight that you can look back at 2002 and ask the questions: Should we have notified? Should we have stopped distribution?'' Mr. McCoy said in that July interview with The Minneapolis Star Tribune. ''And the answers to those questions in 2002 was 'No' and 'No.'''
 But in December 2002, just a few months after fixing the Prizm 2 DR, Guidant received F.D.A. approval to sell another heart device, one that would also short-circuit. The unit was an advanced pacemaker plus a defibrillator called the Contak Renewal. It is used in patients with congestive heart failure.
 The parallels between the flaws in the two devices would prove striking. So would the actions of company officials. While Guidant, as it did with the Prizm 2 DR, reported the Contak Renewal's failures to the F.D.A., it also did not tell doctors about the failures until this June. 
 Both models shorted in a small number of cases because of deteriorating wiring insulation, Guidant has said. And a link between those episodes may be the insulator polyimide.
 Guidant's two major competitors, Medtronic and St. Jude, have previously used the material or are currently using it. But until recently, Guidant used polyimide in a way that the two other companies do not -- to coat electrical wires in a component that sits atop the sealed part of a heart device. 
 The component, called the header, is essentially a junction box connecting a unit's computer and power supply with cables, or leads, that carry electrical impulses to the heart.
 However, body fluids can slowly seep into the header, which is not hermetically sealed, and cause polyimide to deteriorate in some cases, said two engineers who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they work for other companies. In several cases, short circuits in the Guidant units occurred about two years after implant, F.D.A. records show.
 It was during the second half of last year -- when secret talks between Guidant and Johnson & Johnson were under way -- that the device maker started receiving reports from hospitals about short circuits in the Contak Renewal as well as continuing problems with the Prizm 2 DR. 
 In a statement, Guidant said it had used polyimide with great success for more than a decade in many company devices. The company said that problems related to polyimide deterioration were limited to three models: the Prizm 2 DR, the Contak Renewal, and a related unit called the Contak Renewal 2. The affected Contak Renewals were made before late August 2004, Guidant has said. 
 ''We have had no reports of shorting failures which inhibit therapy as a result of polyimide degradation'' in other company models, Guidant said in its statement. It also said it used different connecting components in other models. 
 Guidant executives like Mr. McCoy have insisted that their decisions about when to disclose product defects were not affected by financial factors, like the pending Johnson & Johnson deal. Guidant said that as with the Prizm 2 DR, the rate of failure of the Contak Renewal was not high enough to meet the company's criteria for notifying doctors.
 ''At this company, the quality culture is absolutely apparent,'' Mr. McCoy said in his July interview with the Minneapolis Star Tribune. 
 Others are skeptical. ''I think J.&J. colored things,'' said Dr. Hauser of Minneapolis.

Changes in Iowa
 Whatever the case, the ripple effects of Guidant's recalls were felt throughout the summer and fall in doctors' offices and medical centers nationwide. One place was the University of Iowa Hospitals in Iowa City. 
 ''Every day, you didn't know what was going to happen,'' the facility's director of cardiac electrophysiology, Dr. Brian Olshansky, recalled recently. ''You were getting calls from all kinds of people. There would be another 'Dear Doctor' letter on my desk. Another patient calling. Another person from an investment house wanting guidance.''
 In recent months, about a third of the patients at the Iowa medical center with Prizm 2 DR's underwent replacement procedures. Physicians, in deciding whether to replace a device, typically weigh surgical risks like infection against factors like a patient's dependence on a device. 
 Initially, one patient, Angela Martin, did not make that cut. Ms. Martin had received a Prizm 2 DR defibrillator in 2000 after collapsing from cardiac arrest during a meeting at a Veterans Affairs hospital, where she worked as an X-ray technician.
 Her doctors believed that she was at low risk because her defibrillator had never fired. At first, Ms. Martin said she was also content to wait a year or so until the unit's battery drained and it would be replaced anyway.
 But as the summer wore on, she read newspaper articles about additional recalls. By August she had read enough and asked for a new device. 
 ''I was getting nervous,'' said Ms. Martin, 43, who lives in West Liberty, Iowa, a town about 20 miles east of Iowa City. ''I said, 'Let's get this done. I don't want a lot of ifs in the back of my head.'''
 In recent weeks, the clinic's pace has returned to normal, said Dr. Olshansky. Yesterday, Guidant announced that it had regained more than 80 percent of the market share it had lost as a result of the recalls. 
 But it will not regain all its lost ground at University of Iowa Hospitals. Until recently, it largely used Guidant devices because the hospital, like others, can get price discounts by dealing with a limited number of manufacturers. That has changed.
 Dr. Olshansky, who is heading a clinical trial sponsored by Guidant, said the recalls had cost the hospital so much money in terms of expenses like increased patient follow-up that officials decided it made more economic sense to spread their risks. Now, the hospital is using devices made by all three major manufacturers.
 There was another factor behind the change, Dr. Olshansky added. He said he liked Guidant's devices. But he simply got tired of trying to explain to patients, after everything that had occurred, why he was giving them one.
 ''It was difficult to swallow,'' Dr. Olshansky said.


CORRECTION-DATE: October 27, 2005

 CORRECTION:
A front-page article last Thursday about the role played by the insulating material polyimide in the flaws in some Guidant heart devices included an erroneous reference from a spokesman for a rival company, Medtronic, to its own use of the material. The company uses polyimide inside the sealed section of a heart unit; it has not discontinued its use.

HEADLINE: Economy Shrugs Off Setbacks, Reports Say

BYLINE: By VIKAS BAJAJ

 BODY:
The nation's economy displayed resilience in September despite two devastating hurricanes and surging energy costs, economic reports released yesterday show.
 New-home construction picked up speed in September and permits for new building jumped, the Commerce Department reported yesterday, indicating that rising interest rates and concerns about inflation have not yet slowed the new housing market. A separate report said mortgage applications for home purchases rose last week.
And a Federal Reserve survey of the national economy, known as the beige book, said that most of the country was experiencing ''moderate or gradual'' economic growth because of improved hiring, higher wages and increased growth in several industries. 
 The Dow Jones industrial average rose 128.87 points, or 1.25 percent, to 10,414.13 yesterday. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index climbed 1.5 percent, and the Nasdaq composite index rose 1.71 percent. The stock market, which surged late in the day, was responding not only to the economic data but also to quarterly profit reports from J.P. Morgan Chase, Bank of America and Yahoo, among others.
 In addition, the markets reacted to a report showing rising inventories of oil and gasoline.
 ''When you look through the vast majority of reports -- even the ones that are bad -- what you see is the undertow is still pretty strong,'' said Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist for Wells Capital Management.
 Joshua Shapiro, chief United Sates economist at Maria Fiorini Ramirez, an investment firm in New York, agreed with that assessment. ''Basically, what they are saying is the underlying health of the economy was very good pre-hurricane and pre-spike in energy prices,'' he said. ''And it is still pretty good after those things.''
 Housing starts, which measure the beginning of new construction, increased 3.4 percent, to a seasonally adjusted annual pace of 2.1 million, after dipping in July and August, the Commerce Department reported. New housing permits rose 2.4 percent, to an annual pace of 2.1 million.
 The Fed's survey reported robust hiring in financial, professional and technical services and even cited labor shortages in industries like trucking. But it also noted concerns about rising energy prices, particularly higher home heating bills expected this winter, and the potential for weaker consumer spending and broader inflation.
 ''Clearly, retailers are very nervous,'' Mr. Shapiro said, noting the early Christmas promotions.
 Analysts and investors have been closely monitoring the housing sector to gauge the effects of higher interest rates. Some reports have shown that housing prices in some cities have fallen in recent months and that homes are staying on the market longer.
 Economists had expected housing starts to fall to an annual rate of 1.97 million and building permits to dip to a pace of 2.08 million.
 The latest data confirmed some economists' belief that home sales and prices are likely to remain at a fairly high level, without seeing the explosive growth rates of recent years or the sharp drop that some analysts have predicted.
 ''The market is strong,'' said Ken Mayland, president of ClearView Economics, a research firm based in Pepper Pike, Ohio. But, he added, ''I think we are in the final throes of these superstrong housing start numbers.''
 The increased construction activity was not spread evenly across the country: housing starts were up 6.9 percent in the South and 1.9 percent in the Midwest, but unchanged in the West and Northeast, where the boom has been strongest until recently. Permits rose the most in the West, Northeast and Midwest, and fell in the South.
 The Fed's beige book also said it was difficult to get a clear national picture on housing. Federal Reserve branches in Chicago, St. Louis, Dallas and San Francisco said activity was expanding or staying strong. But Boston and New York reported homes were not selling as fast. The Atlanta branch, which covers the Gulf Coast, said demand was strong in areas that have drawn evacuees from the hurricane-damaged areas.
 Home-building activity on the Gulf Coast is expected to pick up later this year and early next year. The areas affected by the storm make up just a small portion of the Southern economic region, 2.4 percent, according to the Commerce Department.
 Another report yesterday, from the Mortgage Bankers Association, said loan applications for home purchases were up 7.3 percent last week. The average interest rate on a 30-year fixed mortgage was 6.03 percent last week, about a quarter-point higher than at the start of the year, according to Freddie Mac. Rates on five- and one-year adjustable rate mortgages have increased by half a point.
 Exceptionally low mortgage rates, combined with the rapid growth in interest-only and adjustable-rate loans, have allowed more Americans to buy homes in recent years. They have also been blamed by some analysts for helping to feed regional housing bubbles.
 ''We have some indications that housing markets are cooling off, although the signs are scattered and mostly anecdotal,'' Donald L. Kohn, a Fed governor, said in a speech in Pittsburgh yesterday. ''A substantial slowing in the pace of house-price appreciation seems inevitable as prices reach high levels relative to interest rates, rents and incomes.''
 Citing the strength in the economy and rising prices, Mr. Kohn also suggested that the Fed would continue to raise interest rates. The Fed has raised the short-term fed funds rate that determines overnight borrowing costs between banks 11 times since June 2004. It now stands at 3.75 percent.
 The beige book, which policy makers will consult when they meet next on Nov. 1, noted strength in the labor market, construction industry, manufacturing activity and lending.

HEADLINE: Pouring on Emotions, Like Music Filling a Cathedral

BYLINE: By BEN RATLIFF

 BODY:
Jim James, the singer and leader of My Morning Jacket, tried to speak to the audience on Tuesday night at Webster Hall, but couldn't. When he tried, it sounded like 10 watery voices booming, out of sync, from 10 different places. The engineer hadn't turned off Mr. James's reverb. 
 My Morning Jacket wants to flood your emotions, the way music in a cathedral can, and Mr. James's voice, through all that reverb, conducts chills. Its primary position is singing-for-yourself, high and nasal, a little bit like Bob Dylan's ''Nashville Skyline'' vocal persona, or like the voice that the cellist and singer Arthur Russell used on his album ''World of Echo.'' But he moves it outward, using a strong falsetto, pushing his inner world into yours.
The echo fixation has done My Morning Jacket right for six years, although one can see the end of that road on the horizon. It has already begun to address it: ''Z,'' its new album, luxuriates less in the physics of the resonating chamber and more in the dry science of songcraft and arrangements; it's harder and leaner, with less acoustic guitar than before, and less reliance on an old notion of Southern rock.
 This is a band long on good ideas and ways to sequence them. Tuesday night's show was above all well organized, with pockets of jamming opening up inside tight dimensions; there were serious shifts in mood, as if several bands were living inside one. ''Run Thru,'' one of the set's longer songs, went at a crawl, with a biting guitar line doubling Mr. James's singing, and a big, spooky organ sound in the back: Pink Floyd, if you like. Then the band pivoted into tribal drumbeats in double time, as if taking cues from the stoner-rock band High on Fire.
 ''What a Wonderful Man,'' a new rave-up, did something similar. And ''Off the Record'' began with reggae, emphasizing the second and fourth beat, then started whomping down with equal force on the one and the three as Mr. James and the band's other guitarist, Carl Broemel, wove their lines together for a few minutes at a stretch, going quiet and then surging.
 This band has the will to stretch songs and started to do it halfway through the set. But it didn't go far enough: one could imagine ''Off the Record,'' as well as ''It Beats 4 U,'' a new song with an unusual drum pattern, at twice their length. Mr. James is a wizard of momentum: as the songwriter and band leader and the guitarist with the more personal touch, these songs are his playgrounds. After having set the frequency of each song with his voice, he strikes with a guitar solo at exactly the peak moment, once the rhythm section has plied its medium-tempo groove for just long enough. 
 But for all that momentum, there was never enough release in pure sound. Tuesday's show, like others on this tour, was a 16-song retrospective when could it have been a 12-song feast of sound at the same length. Four or five times, the band went right to the brink, where you might have expected extra stretches of real collective improvising, or several extra minutes raking up textures, working over drones. Instead, the band economically completed the solos, then hustled the songs to an end, clamping them shut; it had the effect of leaving you peering down, feeling dizzy.

HEADLINE: Institute Once Led by Ferrer Forms Base of His Support

BYLINE: By MIKE McINTIRE

 BODY:
As he has pursued his mayoral bid this year, Fernando Ferrer stood out from the field of candidates in this significant way: He did not hold elective office as his Democratic primary opponents or the incumbent mayor did, and instead had been making his money as an executive for a public policy group.
 After losing his last mayoral race in 2001, and prevented by term limits from seeking re-election as Bronx borough president, Mr. Ferrer took a $150,000-a-year job as president of the Drum Major Institute, a liberal policy group. The move took him out of the arena of city politics for the first time in 20 years, and opened him to criticism in some quarters that he had forsaken his Bronx street credentials for the relative comforts of armchair advocacy.
But far from losing his edge by leaving politics, Mr. Ferrer used the institute to amplify one of his central campaign themes, that middle-class families are being squeezed by high costs and government indifference. 
 The institute actually became not only a vehicle for shaping his policies, but also a rallying point for his campaign contributors, whose donations helped pay for its operations. In fact, the list of the institute's major donors resembles the list of major contributors to Mr. Ferrer.
 ''Clearly, what he did at D.M.I. was to prepare for a mayoral run, and to sound out themes of a mayoral run,'' said Hank Sheinkopf, a political consultant who once worked for Mr. Ferrer. ''That's not unheard of, for people to find a sinecure while seeking public office.''
 Mr. Ferrer and his allies deny that his three years at the institute were essentially a candidacy-in-waiting. Friends say he turned down more lucrative job offers, in part because he believed in the institute's mission of pursuing social change in the manner of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., whose family is involved in running it. 
 In a recent interview, Mr. Ferrer said that the institute's shift in emphasis to middle-class concerns was in keeping with his own beliefs and those of Dr. King, who advocated for working families and unionized labor.
 ''This was an opportunity for me to really put myself where all my talk was all those years,'' Mr. Ferrer said. ''The right had almost been ceded the intellectual territory on middle-class issues. We wanted to create a voice for progressive values that are neither left nor right.''
 With Mr. Ferrer running for mayor again, his stewardship of the institute provides some timely insights into his abilities as a manager and his political viewpoints. It also sheds light on his core group of supporters. 
 His mayoral campaign includes several aides and consultants who have worked for the institute. One of his biggest fund-raisers is the institute's founder, William B. Wachtel, a Manhattan lawyer who has collected close to $100,000 for Mr. Ferrer and whose college-age children have each donated the maximum $4,950 to his campaign.
 As the campaign heated up, Mr. Ferrer's continued links with the institute -- he stepped down last year to campaign full time -- have drawn scrutiny.
 In July, the chairman of the state Republican Party complained about Mr. Wachtel's fund-raising for Mr. Ferrer and accused the institute of releasing a report critical of school safety to embarrass Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, something the institute denied.
 The Bloomberg campaign also accused the institute's chairman of partisan motives after he criticized the mayor's unsuccessful effort to secure the 2012 Summer Olympics for New York.
 To be sure, the institute, whose directors include Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Martin Luther King III and the former Atlanta mayor and ambassador Andrew Young, is far more than the instrument of Mr. Ferrer's mayoral ambitions. It has held seminars around the country on education reform, unemployment and other social issues, sponsored fellowships and published reports on a variety of public policy topics, some of them approving of the Bloomberg administration.
 It has played host to President Bill Clinton, and sponsored guest speakers including John Edwards, Howard Dean and Eliot Spitzer.
 The group's executive director, Andrea Batista Schlesinger, who worked for Mr. Ferrer in the Bronx before following him to the institute in 2002, said their goal was to create a vibrant forum for debating ways to improve the lives of underprivileged and working-class people. The institute, she said, was never about Mr. Ferrer.
 ''It was clear that we were going to build an institute that was bigger than one person and would last beyond one person's tenure,'' Ms. Schlesinger said. ''The only thing fueling what we did here was, 'How do we build a strong and effective organization?'''
 Originally called the Drum Major Foundation, the organization was founded in 1961 by Harry Wachtel, William's father, who was an adviser to Dr. King. It derives its name from a speech in which Dr. King asked to be remembered as ''a drum major for justice.'' 
 In 1999, it was reconstituted as the Drum Major Institute by William Wachtel, Martin Luther King III, and Mr. Young, who was a friend of Dr. King's.
 With not a lot of money at its disposal, the institute initially conducted a few advocacy campaigns, running newspaper advertisements and holding forums on topics like gun control, poverty and inequities in education. 
 William Wachtel described the institute's early efforts as ''trying to be a woodpecker on the conscience of America.''
 Mr. Wachtel said he became impressed with Mr. Ferrer during the 2001 campaign, and afterward saw an opportunity to ramp up the institute's activities. With help from former Senator Bill Bradley, a meeting was arranged between Mr. Ferrer and members of the institute's board.
 Mr. Ferrer said he came away believing it was a chance to create an organization that could serve as the progressive counterargument to the Manhattan Institute, an established conservative public policy group that was a breeding ground for many of the initiatives of the Rudolph W. Giuliani era. 
 Mr. Ferrer hired more staff and greatly increased fund-raising, taking in $484,000 in his first year as president, compared with $116,000 the year before, according to the institute's tax returns. With a revamped Web site (drummajorinstitute.org) and a more savvy media-relations effort, the institute began promoting reports on voter rights, affordable housing and the economy. It published scorecards of how members of Congress voted on crucial issues.
 ''With a full-time president, people became excited,'' Mr. Wachtel said. ''People believed Freddy was the kind of person you could rally around, and we were able to go from a stride to a run.''
 Mr. Ferrer was well compensated compared to top executives of other similar-size nonprofits in the city, according to a survey by the Nonprofit Coordinating Committee of New York, which represents more than 1,300 groups in the metropolitan region. The median annual salary last year for top executives of groups with operating budgets from $2 million to $5 million was $120,000, the survey said. By comparison, the Drum Major Institute had an operating budget of about $550,000 in 2003, and Mr. Ferrer's salary ranged from $120,000 to $150,000 during his tenure.
 Among the institute's benefactors who also became Mr. Ferrer's campaign contributors were labor unions, health care companies and real estate groups that have business dealings with the city. Another donor was a Massachusetts company trying to build a fertilizer factory in the Bronx.
 The state's largest health care union, 1199/S.E.I.U., a politically influential group that had a close relationship with Dr. King and recently endorsed Mr. Ferrer for mayor, gave at least $75,000 to theinstitute during Mr. Ferrer's tenure -- the equivalent of about half his salary. The institute's largest individual contributor is Mr. Wachtel, who gave at least $100,000 in 2004. He has also emerged as a major fund-raiser for Mr. Ferrer's mayoral campaign, and Mr. Ferrer's contributors include several clients of Mr. Wachtel's law firm, which has lobbied City Hall on behalf of real estate developers and outdoor advertising companies.
 By the time Mr. Ferrer formed a new committee to explore another run for mayor in November 2003, the institute had shifted its focus to issues facing the middle class, a theme that Mr. Ferrer adopted as a central plank in his campaign platform. Two months earlier, the institute released the findings of a poll -- conducted by Global Strategy Group, a consultant to Mr. Ferrer's campaign -- showing that New Yorkers were worried about making ends meet.
 ''If we do not intervene, we are taking out a terrible mortgage on the vitality of our city,'' Mr. Ferrer said in an institute news release, which was posted for a time on his campaign Web site but has since been removed.
 The institute, a tax-exempt charity that calls itself nonpartisan, is sensitive to accusations that its activities have overlapped with those of the Ferrer campaign. Ms. Schlesinger said the institute's new emphasis on the middle class was in keeping with Dr. King's concern for union laborers, and indicative of the institute's desire to steer a path between ''tired orthodoxies'' on the political left and right.
 ''The left was somewhat allergic to talking about the middle class,'' she said. ''But the middle-class work is actually a lens through which we evaluate all social and economic policy. It's as much about expanding the middle class as it is about the existing middle class.''
 It is not clear what Mr. Young and Mr. King think of Mr. Ferrer's leadership of the institute or his campaign for mayor; neither man responded to messages left at their offices. When Mr. Ferrer left, Mr. Young issued a statement praising him: ''Under Freddy's leadership, D.M.I. has helped shape the conversation about the future of America's middle class and those who want to work their way to the American dream.''
 Last year, at a Ferrer fund-raiser organized by Mr. Wachtel, Mr. King and Mr. Young each contributed $50, while another board member donated $1,000 and the institute's accountant wrote a check for $4,950. Mr. Wachtel said it would be wrong to read too much into the smaller donations from Mr. King and Mr. Young.
 ''Andy actually offered to contribute more,'' he said. ''But the feeling was, their making a contribution was a very kind gesture.''

HEADLINE: Fare Cuts For Holidays Are Called Into Question

BYLINE: By SEWELL CHAN

 BODY:
It may seem like a benevolent year-end gift, but fiscal analysts and watchdog groups from both ends of the political spectrum yesterday criticized as irresponsible the Metropolitan Transportation Authority's plan to give subway, bus and commuter-rail riders fare discounts during the holiday season.
 The discounts, which would be unprecedented in scope and cost an estimated $50 million this year in lost revenue, may secure some sorely needed good will for the authority, which is urging voters to approve a $2.9 billion state transportation bond act on Election Day.
But the authority faces a grim fiscal situation in the near future, as rising debt payments threaten to devour its operating budget. The authority hopes to balance its books next year, but anticipates a net budget deficit of $128 million in 2007, rising to $880 million in 2009. 
 Liberal and conservative analysts alike questioned the prudence of the temporary discounts.
 ''Why is the M.T.A. engaging in feel-good, short-term gimmicks rather than convincing riders and business leaders that it has sensible, long-term plans for a balanced operating budget and a fully funded capital budget?'' asked James A. Parrott, chief economist at the Fiscal Policy Institute, a liberal research organization that focuses on New York State. 
 Edmund J. McMahon, an expert in New York State fiscal policy at the Manhattan Institute, a conservative policy group, said: ''There's no question that the most responsible use of the money would be to pay down the authority's unfunded pension liability. The M.T.A. is a monopoly service provider. If they want to buy good will, they should improve service.''
 Nonpartisan observers also questioned the extent to which the public would benefit from the discounts, which the authority believes would promote the use of mass transit, relieve traffic congestion and provide relief to residents facing sharply higher gasoline and heating-oil prices. 
 Elizabeth Lynam, a researcher at the Citizens Budget Commission, a nonpartisan group that monitors city finances, predicted that the plan would only confuse riders. ''It doesn't do the M.T.A. any favor in the long run with the public, because they will have to turn around and raise fares in the future,'' she said. ''A yo-yo fare policy is ill advised. First fares are down, then they are up. What's the story?''
 Preston Niblack, a deputy director of the New York City Independent Budget Office, noted that the authority plans to borrow an additional $9.3 billion in its latest capital plan, for 2005 to 2009. ''Whom does this actually benefit?'' he asked of the discounts. ''It does not really solve any structural issues. It's great from a public relations point of view, but it does not address long-term needs.''
 The plan, prepared at the request of the authority's chairman, Peter S. Kalikow, would divide a one-time surplus, estimated at roughly $700 million by the end of this year, as follows: $450 million to bolster pension funds; $150 million for service and security improvements; and $100 million for fare discounts this year and next. The plan needs approval from the authority's board, which is expected. 
 Mr. Kalikow declined yesterday to address the fiscal merits of the discounts. ''I think it's a nice gesture that we can do,'' he said. Speaking at Grand Central Terminal at a swearing-in ceremony for Kevin J. McConville, the authority's new police chief, Mr. Kalikow conceded that fares may increase substantially in 2007, but added, ''We don't have to face that issue until the summer of '06.'' 
 Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, whose re-election campaign could benefit if riders mistakenly give him credit for the discount, issued a statement praising the plan. ''Reducing fares will provide much-welcome relief to the millions of New Yorkers who ride our buses and subways every day, and will also be good for tourists, during one of the city's busiest times of the year,'' he said. 
 Fernando Ferrer, the Democratic candidate for mayor, lambasted the discount plan as an empty election-year gift to Mr. Bloomberg, a Republican. ''They're an attempt to cover up his failure to make real investments in making our subways safe and affordable for the last four years,'' Mr. Ferrer said in a statement.
 Aside from the fiscal consequences, perhaps the most intriguing aspect of the discounts is the idea of charging different prices at different times. 
 Under the plan, the base fare -- for a single ride on the subway, a nonexpress bus in New York City or Long Island, and the Staten Island Railway -- will be reduced by half, to $1, on weekends between Thanksgiving and New Year's Day and throughout the last week of December. 
 The authority will also sell a special 40-day MetroCard, good for travel from Nov. 23 to Jan. 1, for $76 -- the price of a regular 30-day unlimited-ride card.
 Riders will be able to buy the card, which automatically expires after Jan. 1, only with cash at subway station booths, because the electronic vending machines are not configured to sell special cards. Any regular 30-day card activated between those dates will carry four bonus days, and any regular 7-day card activated between those dates will carry one bonus day.
 Long Island Rail Road and Metro-North Railroad riders will receive a free 10-trip off-peak pass for each monthly pass, and a free round-trip off-peak ticket for each weekly pass, purchased in December. 
 Unlike the subway systems in Washington and San Francisco, the New York City subway system cannot charge by distance because it has no way to record where individual riders exit. Given that limitation, some transit planners have urged the authority to charge higher fares during the commuter rush and lower fares at off-peak hours -- a practice known as congestion pricing. 
 Although the MetroCard system, introduced in 1994, allows such a system, it has never been attempted until now.
 ''Leaving aside serious fiscal issues, it's not a bad idea to experiment with differential pricing -- and the weekends might be a good place to start,'' said Nicole Gelinas, a fellow at the Manhattan Institute. 
 But for now, the cheap weekend rides seem to be, as Mr. Kalikow said yesterday, merely a Christmas present.

HEADLINE: From Huge Project, a Mighty Anger Grows 

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS CONFESSORE

 BODY:
To longtime opponents of the proposed Atlantic Yards development, the intensity and rancor of Tuesday night's environmental impact hearing was not a surprise. They have spent the last two years, after all, mobilizing coalitions of community groups to oppose the project, passing out reams of antidevelopment pamphlets and news releases, and starting Web sites to dissect the project's every twist and turn.
 But the high-decibel hearing on Tuesday clearly demonstrated that the complexion and scope of that opposition has changed since the developer, Bruce Ratner, and his firm, Forest City Ratner Companies, unveiled plans for the office, residential and commercial development in December 2003. As the project has moved out of its conceptual phase, awareness of its sheer size -- nine million square feet, the equivalent of four Empire State Buildings -- and potential impact has spread across Brooklyn, charging a much broader debate about its virtues and flaws. 
''I think people began to realize how big this is,'' said Assemblywoman Joan L. Millman, who, in a setback for the developer, announced at the hearing that she would oppose the project.
 The meeting also revealed that whereas early opposition was driven by a core of residents in Prospect Heights -- the neighborhood that would bear the brunt of the new construction -- opponents now draw support from a broader swath of neighborhoods in north Brooklyn and elsewhere in the borough, particularly Park Slope. Residents of that neighborhood, south of the project site, accounted for an unusually large number of speakers at the meeting, as did residents from nearby Boerum Hill.
 Many of them did not talk about eminent domain, housing or jobs, subjects that dominated the first stage of debate. They spoke about the project's broader impacts on surrounding neighborhoods, including greater demand for day care slots, slower response times for the police and firefighters, and runoff into the Gowanus Canal, the object of a decades-long community revitalization effort.
 ''Park Slope was out in force last night,'' said Councilwoman Letitia James, who represents Prospect Heights and was an early opponent of the project. ''There's no question about it, they have brought more energy to the opposition.''
 But James P. Stuckey, the developer's executive vice president for development, said it would be a mistake to characterize all of those who spoke as opponents of the project.
 ''I don't think that saying, 'We're concerned about the height of buildings, or shadows or traffic,' necessarily means opposition,'' Mr. Stuckey said. ''These are incredibly smart people who think very seriously about the quality of life in their neighborhoods.''
 There is little doubt, however, that awareness of the project has grown significantly. Opponents say it has been driven by several major developments.
 In June, the Bloomberg administration's dream of a West Side stadium died, suddenly making Atlantic Yards the largest residential project currently being envisioned in the city. (Forest City Ratner is also a development partner for the new Midtown office tower being built for The New York Times.) 
 In July, the project's architect, Frank Gehry, released designs that vividly illustrated the skyscrapers that would tower over the surrounding neighborhoods, overshadowing the historic Williamsburg Savings Bank tower and casting shadows for blocks around. 
 And in September, the Empire State Development Corporation released one of the first formal planning documents for the project, beginning its official public review phase.
 ''For a lot of Park Slope residents, especially, the point of galvanization came with the unveiling of the latest Gehry design,'' said Eric McClure, a member of Park Slope Neighbors, one group that opposes the plan.
 It is unclear what effects the sentiments expressed at the hearing will have. In some respects, Mr. Ratner beat his opponents to the punch, taking care in the project's early days to line up support from community leaders and elected officials beyond the footprint. They include Councilmen David Yassky and Bill de Blasio, who represent most of the neighborhoods to the west of Flatbush Avenue, as well Marty Markowitz, the borough president.
 ''Strategically, we've always understood that this project was going to be something that all the surrounding neighborhoods will pay attention to, especially in what people call the Brownstone belt,'' Mr. Stuckey said yesterday. ''I actually was not surprised at all that they came last night.''
 The project is also well insulated from direct public pressure. Because a state agency, the Empire State Development Corporation, is sponsoring the proposal, it will not have to wind through the city's labyrinthine land-use process, which requires input from the local community boards and a vote by the City Council.
 Brad Lander, director of the Pratt Institute's Center for Community Development, pointed out that even if the project were subject to city approval, Tuesday's hearing would still have been the first where the public could have aired concerns about it. ''A public process doesn't begin until there's an official plan,'' he said. 
 Mr. McClure said this might have added to the intensity. ''Certainly on the antidevelopment side, the nerve that's being touched there has a lot to do with what has been perceived as a real lack of opportunity for public input into the whole project'' until now, he said.
 He described Forest City Ratner's dozens of talks before community boards and groups as ''a PowerPoint presentation, without much chance for dialogue. This whole idea was kind of predetermined and packaged and presented to the community, but not in a way that it could have any meaningful input and effect on it.''
 Some residents took solace in Assemblywoman Millman's decision to oppose the project, and from a statement by one of her colleagues, Assemblyman James F. Brennan, expressing concerns about it.
 Yesterday, Ms. Millman said she would urge Sheldon Silver, the Assembly Speaker, to oppose the project. Mr. Silver sits on the Public Authorities Control Board, which must vote on the project. 
 ''He usually tends to follow what the people who represent the area say,'' she said. ''So I intend to chime in with my thoughts on that.''

CORRECTION-DATE: October 25, 2005

 CORRECTION:
An article on Thursday about opposition to the Atlantic Yards development project in Brooklyn referred incompletely to the position of Councilman David Yassky. While the project's developer, Bruce C. Ratner, indeed solicited his support early on, Mr. Yassky said he was withholding it until his concerns were addressed. 
 An article on Sept. 15 about the Metropolitan Transportation Authority's decision to sell Mr. Ratner the development rights misstated the location of a new railyard he plans to build. (That error also appeared in an article on Sept. 7.) The new site is east of the existing one, not west. A reader pointed out the error in a recent e-mail message.

HEADLINE: Old Ways of Life Are Fading as the Arctic Thaws

BYLINE: This article is by Steven Lee Myers, Andrew C. Revkin, Simon Romero and Clifford Krauss.; Craig Duff contributed reporting for this article.

DATELINE: TIKSI, Russia 

 BODY:
Freed by warming, waters once locked beneath ice are gnawing at coastal settlements around the Arctic Circle.
 In Bykovsky, a village of 457 on Russia's northeast coast, the shoreline is collapsing, creeping closer and closer to houses and tanks of heating oil, at a rate of 15 to 18 feet a year. Eventually, homes will be lost, and maybe all of Bykovsky, too, under ever-longer periods of assault by open water. ''It is eating up the land,'' said Innokenty Koryakin, a member of the Evenk tribe and the captain of a fishing boat. ''You cannot do anything about it.''
To the east, Fyodor V. Sellyakhov scours a barren island with 16 hired men. Mammoths lived here tens of thousands of years ago, and their carcasses eventually sank deep into sediment that is now offering up a trove of tusks and bones nearly as valuable as elephant ivory. 
 Mr. Sellyakhov, a native Yakut, hauls the fossils to a warehouse here and sells them for $25 to $50 a pound. This summer he collected two tons, making him a wealthy man, for Tiksi. ''The sea washes down the coast every year,'' he said. ''It is practically all ice -- permafrost -- and it is thawing.'' 
 For the four million people who live north of the Arctic Circle, in remote outposts and the improbable industrial centers built by Soviet decree, a changing climate presents new opportunities. But it also threatens their environment, their homes and, for those whose traditions rely on the ice-bound wilderness, the preservation of their culture.
 A push to develop the North, quickened by the melting of the Arctic seas, carries its own rewards and dangers for people in the region. The discovery of vast petroleum fields in the Barents and Kara Seas has raised fears of catastrophic accidents as ships loaded with oil and, soon, liquefied gas churn through the fisheries off Scandinavia, headed to markets in Europe and North America. Land that was untouched could be tainted by pollution as generators, smokestacks and large vehicles sprout to support the growing energy industry. 
 But the thaw itself is already causing widespread anxiety. In Russia, 20 percent of which lies above the Arctic Circle, melting of the permafrost threatens the foundations of homes, factories, pipelines. While the primary causes are debated, the effect is an engineering nightmare no one anticipated when the towns were built, in Stalin's time. 
 Coastal erosion is a problem in Alaska as well, forcing the United States to prepare to relocate several Inuit villages at a projected cost of $100 million or more for each one. 
 Across the Arctic, indigenous tribes with traditions shaped by centuries of living in extremes of cold and ice are noticing changes in weather and wildlife. They are trying to adapt, but it can be confounding. 
 Take the Inuit word for June, qiqsuqqaqtuq. It refers to snow conditions, a strong crust at night. Only those traits now appear in May. Shari Gearheard, a climate researcher from Harvard, recalled the appeal of an Inuit hunter, James Qillaq, for a new word at a recent meeting in Canada.
 One sentence stayed in her mind: ''June isn't really June any more.'' 

Changing Traditions
 In Finnmark, Norway's northernmost province, the Arctic landscape unfolds in late winter as an endless snowy plateau, silent but for the cries of the reindeer and the occasional whine of a snowmobile. 
 A changing Arctic is felt there, too. ''The reindeer are becoming unhappy,'' said Issat Heandarat Eira, a 31-year-old reindeer herder and one of 80,000 Samis, or Laplanders, who live in the northern reaches of Scandinavia and Russia. 
 Few countries rival Norway when it comes to protecting the environment and preserving indigenous customs. The state has lavished its oil wealth on the region, and Sami culture has enjoyed something of a renaissance. There is a Nordic Sami Institute, a Sami College, a state-sponsored film festival and a drive-in theater where moviegoers watch from snowmobiles. 
 And yet no amount of government support can convince Mr. Eira that his livelihood, intractably entwined with the reindeer, is not about to change. Like a Texas cattleman, he keeps the size of his herd secret. But he said warmer temperatures in fall and spring were melting the top layers of snow, which then refreeze as ice, making it harder for his reindeer to dig through to the lichen they eat. He worries, too, about the encroachment of highways and industrial activity on his once isolated grazing lands. 
 ''The people who are making the decisions, they are living in the south and they are living in towns,'' said Mr. Eira, sitting inside his home made of reindeer hides. ''They don't mark the change of weather. It is only people who live in nature and get resources from nature who mark it.''
 Other Arctic cultures that rely on nature report similar disruptions. For 5,000 years, the Inuit have lived on the fringe of the Arctic Ocean, using sea ice as a highway, building material and hunting platform. In recent decades, their old ways have been fading under forced relocations, the erosion of language and lore and the lure of modern conveniences, steady jobs and a cash economy. 
 Now the accelerating retreat of the sea ice is making it even harder to preserve their connections to ''country food'' and tradition. In Canada, Inuit hunters report that an increasing number of polar bears look emaciated because the shrinking ice cover has curtailed their ability to fatten up on seals. In Alaska, whale hunters working in unusually open seas have seen walruses try to climb onto their white boats, mistaking them for ice floes. 
 Hank Rogers, a 54-year-old Inuvialuit who helps patrol Canada's Far North, said the pelts of fox, marten and other game he trapped were thinning. As for the flesh of fish caught in coastal estuaries of the Yukon, ''they're too mushy,'' he said. Slushy snow and weaker ice has made traveling by snowmobile impossible in places. 
 ''The next generation coming up is not going to experience what we did,'' he said. ''We can't pass the traditions on as our ancestors passed on to us.'' 
 Even seasoned hunters have been betrayed by the thaw, stepping in snow that should be covering ice but instead falling into water. And on Shingle Point, a sandy strip inhabited by Inuvialuit at the tip of the Yukon in Canada, Danny A. Gordon, 70, said it was troubling that fewer icebergs were reaching the bay. It has become windier, too, for reasons people here cannot explain. 
 ''In the summer 40 years ago, we had lots of icebergs, and you could land your boat on them and climb on them even in summer,'' Mr. Gordon said. ''Now in the winter they are tiny. The weather has changed. Everyone knows it. It's global warming.'' 

Sinking Cities
 Vorkuta, a coal-mining city of 130,000, is crumbling.
 Many of the city's homes and factories were built not on hard rock, but on permafrost, a layer of perpetually frozen earth that covers 65 percent of Russia's territory. If the permafrost underneath melts, the ground turns to mush. 
 ''Everything is falling apart,'' said Lyubov I. Denisova, who lives in a cramped apartment on Lokomotivnaya Street. The ceiling has warped, the walls cracked, the window frames splintered. Some buildings have been declared unsafe and abandoned. 
 Vorkuta lies on the edge of Russia's permafrost boundary, and some scientists predict that continued warming could advance that border hundreds of miles northward, weakening the earth beneath the vast infrastructure built during the days of the Soviet Union's industrialization of the Arctic. According to the Permafrost Institute in Yakutsk, the average temperature of the permafrost has already increased a degree or two. 
 While most Arctic climate experts say the warming trend is driven by heat-trapping emissions and is unlikely to reverse, many scientists and officials in Russia predict the warming of the last 30 years will give way to a new period of cold. Vorkuta's mayor, Igor I. Shpektor, hews to that line. He said the damage in the city -- 80 percent of all buildings show signs of it, one study found -- resulted from faulty construction or maintenance, not a general thaw. 
 Still, Mr. Shpektor acknowledged, ''the permafrost is unforgiving.''
 Any significant warming, said Anatoly A. Chumashov, the city's chief engineer, would leave officials like him scrambling to save the city. ''It is an example of how fragile it is and how careful we should be,'' he said. But he added: ''If the permafrost melts, this city will not collapse overnight. There is time to adjust, but it requires very serious investments in labor and money.'' 

Spills and Depredation
 ''One oil spill would be the end of us,'' said Borge Iversen, a fisherman on the Lofoten Islands, a striking archipelago north of the Arctic Circle in the Norwegian Sea. 
 As recently as 2000, Russian tankers were rarely spotted passing the jagged peaks and sheltered inlets, surrounded by seas with the world's largest stocks of cod and herring, as well as killer and sperm whales. So far, there has not been a major accident, but the ships appear more and more, a harbinger of Russia's expanding efforts to extract oil and, increasingly, gas in the Arctic. 
 As much as a quarter of the world's remaining oil and gas resources are believed to exist in the Arctic. And as technology improves, oil prices rise and the seasonal ice cap retreats, countries like Norway and Russia are acting with startling speed. 
 Oil shipments from the White Sea and the coast of the Barents Sea have soared, said Mikhail M. Kalenchenko, director of the World Wildlife Fund's branch in Murmansk, the Russian port. 
 ''It was supposed to increase over the next 10 years, up to 20 million tons of oil,'' he said. ''It's 20 million this year,'' or 146 million barrels. At this rate, he said, ''we can expect up to 100 million tons, over 10 to 20 years, to be transported through our area.'' 
 Russia's history of environmental protection is a poor one. The Soviet drive for industrial development paid little heed to the natural spaces around its mines, factories and ports. Its disregard is evident in the poisoned wasteland around the nickel smelter in Monchegorsk, south of Murmansk, where hundreds of square miles of what was once forest is now almost entirely devoid of life. 
 Western countries have paid millions to help Russia dismantle its aging fleet of nuclear submarines in the area and safely store the nuclear material aboard them, but Mr. Kalenchenko said far less attention had been paid to the environmental risks of expanding oil shipments in the same area, most in single-hull tankers. 
 ''What has never happened before is a big accident in the high seas in the Artic,'' he said. For the entire Barents region, he said, Russia has only two bases with the equipment necessary to fight an oil spill. ''In Norway, they have at least 50 bases of this kind,'' he said. 
 David Dickins, an engineer from San Diego who has spent 30 years studying how to clean up oil spills in icy waters, said that while the ice impeded the use of tools like booms that hold a slick in place, the ice also naturally contained the oil, giving response teams more time to act before environmental damage occurred. 
 ''People ought not paint the Arctic in some sort of raving sense where a spill is somehow going to be catastrophic,'' he said.
 But he added: ''A spill is always serious. In the Arctic it will naturally take longer to clean up because there is less wave action, and breakdown is slower in colder temperatures.'' 
 That is what worries Mr. Iversen, who sails each morning from the village of Ballstad, into the coastal waters around the Lofoten Islands. The village's history, islanders say, reaches back to the Vikings, and fishing is central to the region's social and economic life. 
 ''We've fished these waters for centuries, and while it's a hard life, we've survived in doing so,'' he said. 
 Although the fishing industry accounts for less than 1 percent of Norway's gross domestic product, as against the nearly 18 percent brought in by oil and gas, the fisheries are Norway's second-largest earner of foreign exchange and are viewed as a more sustainable resource. 
 ''We need a policy for the Arctic that considers the next 100 years, not just the next 10 years,'' Mr. Iversen said. 
 Such sentiment goes far in Norway, where fishing is still part of the oil-rich nation's soul. On Oct. 13, a new leftist coalition upheld a ban on drilling in the waters around the Lofoten Islands until 2009, while allowing exploration to proceed further north in the Barents Sea. As for the tanker traffic, Oslo is looking at other ways of advancing its concerns. 
 Norway and the seven other Arctic nations have started to discuss ways to protect the environment they share in a forum called the Arctic Council, established nine years ago. In 2002, the council issued guidelines for offshore oil drilling, calling for drilling projects to be preceded by studies on environmental effects and the availability of cleanup equipment. 
 The guidelines come with no enforcement powers, but several experts say they think they will have some effect, particularly because Russia is preparing for entry into the World Trade Organization and seeking closer ties with the European Union. 

A Less Wild Future
 One day last summer, the 1,200 residents of Pangnirtung, a windswept outpost on a fjord in Nunavut, Canada's Inuit-administered Arctic territory, were startled to see a 400-foot European cruise ship drop anchor unannounced and send several hundred tourists ashore in small boats. 
 While small ships have stopped in the Canadian Arctic, visits from large liners are increasing as interest grows in the opening Northwest Passage, said Maureen Bundgaard, chief executive of Nunavut Tourism, a trade association. 
 Ms. Bundgaard has been training villagers how to stage cultural shows, conduct day tours and sell crafts and traditional fare -- without being overrun. ''We're not prepared to deal with the huge ships, emotionally or in other ways,'' she said.
 Inuit leaders say they are trying to balance tradition with the inevitable changes that are sweeping their lands. The Inuit Circumpolar Conference, which represents 155,000 Inuit scattered across Canada, Greenland, Russia and the United States, has enlisted lawyers and movie stars like Jake Gyllenhaal and Salma Hayek to draw attention to its imperiled traditions. 
 The group's leaders hope to submit a petition to the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights in December, claiming that the United States, by rejecting a treaty requiring other industrialized countries to cut emissions linked to warming, is willfully threatening the Inuit's right to exist. 
 The commission, an investigative arm of the Organization of American States, has no enforcement powers. But legal analysts say that a declaration that the United States has violated the Inuit's rights could create the foundation for a lawsuit either against the United States in international court or American companies in federal courts. 
 But some Inuit question the wisdom of the petition. They ask, how can they push countries to stem global warming when the Inuit's own prosperity in places like Nunavut is tied to revenues from oil and gas, which are sources of greenhouse gases when burned? 
 Sheila Watt-Cloutier, the elected chairwoman of the group, said the goal was not to stop development but to make sure that native cultures had a say in how development was carried out. 
 ''It's how we do the business that's more important,'' she said. ''There are more environmentally friendly ways in which we can do development and still live a certain way, with a way of life and business that can balance both.'' While it is the people of the Arctic who will feel the melt and the rush for development most directly, the world, too, will have to give up something -- its treasured notion of the Far North as a place of wilderness, simplicity and unspoiled cultures. 
 In a report on Arctic development, the United Nations Environment Program estimated that 15 percent of the region's lands were affected in 2001 by mining, oil and gas exploration, ports or other industrial incursions. But that figure is likely to reach 80 percent in 2050, it said. The Arctic, then, is probably making the same transition that swept the coastal plains of the North Slope of Alaska starting 38 years ago when the first oil was struck in Prudhoe Bay, said Charles Wohlforth, an Alaskan and author of ''The Whale and the Supercomputer,'' describing Arctic climate change. 
 Since then, a lacework of pipelines and wells has steadily spread west and east from that central field, ending the sweeping sense of emptiness that defined the Arctic landscape through the ages. 
 ''Even if you support oil development and think it makes sense, there's a point at which it becomes West Texas or the Gulf of Mexico and is not really the Arctic any more,'' Mr. Wohlforth said.

HEADLINE: Report Calls Communist Party Rule Essential to Democracy in China

BYLINE: By JIM YARDLEY

DATELINE: BEIJING, Oct. 19 

 BODY:
China issued its first white paper on democracy on Wednesday, but included no initiatives for political change and left little doubt of the Communist Party's determination to maintain its grip on power.
 The report, ''Building of Political Democracy in China,'' emphasizes the importance of economic development and social stability in establishing a democracy. It says the continued rule of the Communist Party is ''the most important and fundamental principle for developing socialist political democracy in China.'' 
 The timing of the report coincides with growing protests in the countryside and recent calls by American officials for more openness and political change in China. Last month, Robert B. Zoellick, deputy secretary of state, used a major address on China to urge the Communist Party to expand the use of direct elections and pursue further political change.
 This week, World Bank President Paul D. Wolfowitz visited China and, while offering praise, urged the government to grant more political rights to China's 1.3 billion citizens. Mr. Wolfowitz, the former American deputy secretary of defense, said in a speech during his visit that allowing more public participation in governance helped reduce corruption. But the new report offers little to suggest that China plans immediate or significant changes. President Hu Jintao, who also leads the Communist Party, has disappointed those who had hoped his rise to power would bring greater political liberalization. Instead, he has tightened controls on the media and emphasized the predominance of the party.
 Even as the economy continues to grow at almost double-digit rates, tensions are rippling through Chinese society. Rural protests are rising over corruption, pollution and land seizures, while recall petitions in different villages have taken aim at corrupt local officials. Often, such petition movements are met with brute force by local government. Mr. Wolfowitz also noted that roughly 150 million people in China still live in ''acute poverty.'' Other studies have shown that more than 500 million people live on less than $2 a day. 
 The white paper, issued by the government's State Council, or cabinet, alludes to China's problems without delving deeply into the specifics. ''The democratic system is not yet perfect,'' the report conceded. Later, it added, ''there is still a long way to go in China's building of political democracy.''
 But, mostly, the tone is self-congratulatory. The report proclaimed that the country's current political system had allowed the Chinese people ''to become masters of their own country and society, and enjoy extensive democratic rights.''
 Richard Baum, a China specialist and political science professor at the University of California, Los Angeles, said the report illustrated the leadership's unwillingness to embrace political change. ''There are simply no new ideas here,'' he said. 
 He said Chinese leaders appeared unwilling to expand political freedoms partly because they feared unleashing social upheaval before the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing.
 ''They are coming up against a number of uncomfortable facts,'' Mr. Baum said. ''There is a great deal of repressed demand out there for political expression.'' Of the government, he added, ''there is a fear that if you give an inch, they will take a mile.''
 Recently, Prime Minister Wen Jiabao raised hopes when he said China was planning to expand direct, competitive elections for local officials to the township level. But the report mentions no new township elections.
 It makes clear that the Communist Party has no plans to relinquish power and deems its grip on power essential to China's development.

HEADLINE: New Orleans Mayor Drops Casino-District Idea

BYLINE: By ADAM NOSSITER

DATELINE: NEW ORLEANS, Oct. 19 

 BODY:
Mayor C. Ray Nagin says his much-criticized idea for a Las Vegas-style casino district in the heart of downtown is now dead.
 Mr. Nagin offered the proposal earlier this month, seeking a quick way to revive the city's economy. But critics derided it, saying it would threaten New Orleans's fragile cultural mix and was not the answer to the city's grave economic problems. Gov. Kathleen Babineaux Blanco, who ran for office two years ago on an antigambling platform, also expressed strong reservations about it. 
On Tuesday, testifying in Washington at a Congressional hearing on rebuilding New Orleans, Mr. Nagin told lawmakers that Ms. Blanco's opposition had killed the plan, which would have required state legislative approval.
 ''The governor didn't much like the idea, so it is pretty much dead,'' Mr. Nagin said at the hearing, before a House Transportation and Infrastructure subcommittee. 
 Ms. Blanco had so far declined to include the proposal on the agenda of a special legislative session called for next month, and legislative leaders were known to be cool to it.
 The governor was hardly the only critic. Members of the City Council had been quick to question the plan, in echoes of the fierce controversy that arose during the mid-1990's with the advent of the city's only downtown casino. At the time, backers of that casino, operated by Harrah's, said it would become an economic engine for the city; it has so far failed to do so.
 Several council members are welcoming the abandonment of a scheme apparently hatched after little consultation with other political figures, in keeping with Mr. Nagin's penchant. 
 ''I think it was an intelligent move,'' Councilman Jay Batt said of the plan's withdrawal. ''I think it would destroy the character and culture of our city. Gambling is not economic development.''
 Mr. Nagin had called for allowing a half-dozen of the city's largest hotels downtown to convert to casinos, along Canal and Poydras Streets. He had said that while he was not fond of gambling, he knew of no other way to get the city's economy going. 
 But public opposition was immediate, from newspaper editorials, talk radio and other officeholders. And Harrah's, which has exclusive rights to operate the city's only land-based casino, was unenthusiastic. Its contract would have had to be renegotiated, a prospect that Mr. Nagin acknowledged could be costly. 
 ''The reality is, the political hurdles are too high at this point in time,'' said J. Stephen Perry, president of the New Orleans Convention and Visitors Bureau. He added, ''Many people felt that an issue as complex as gaming is one that needed more time and discussion and business analysis, and that simply was not going to be afforded in as short a time as this.''

HEADLINE: A Web on the Grid

 BODY:
You don't have to dig very deep into the subject of high-speed Internet access before you come across heated arguments over the virtues and shortcomings of nearly every kind of linkage: Wi-Fi, DSL, cable, satellite and ''broadband over power line,'' or B.P.L. It can be hard to believe that an Internet connection could be the focus of so much passion. But humans have an almost primal appetite for information, and no technology has ever promised such a visceral link to information as the Internet. 
 The technology that inspires the most heated argument at the moment may be broadband over power line. It's a simple enough idea. Why not use the pervasive, national network of power lines to provide broadband access? Nearly every residence in the country draws power from the grid, and it is possible that nearly every residence -- no matter how isolated -- could link to the Internet through the grid as well, potentially with much faster connection speeds than through cable. 
Skeptics like to point to trials that have ended unsuccessfully, usually for economic reasons. But there have been successful rollouts of B.P.L. service, especially in Cincinnati and Manassas, Va. The potential of this technology is drawing serious investment from companies like Google and leading to a reimagining of the uses of the power grid both here and in Europe. 
 The obstacles to B.P.L. include technical complications involving the power lines themselves, possible interference at some frequencies and probable opposition from a few Internet providers. But new research and investment -- and the encouragement of the Federal Communications Commission -- may well remove those barriers quickly. This new method of communication deserves a serious look.
 Once you get used to a high-speed connection to the Internet, it's easy to believe that you've already entered the future. But we may soon look back at the broadband access we enjoy now and realize that it was slow, balky and geographically limited.

HEADLINE: South Korea Becoming a Big Asian Investor

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE

DATELINE: SEOUL, South Korea 

 BODY:
Long focused on internal development, South Korea is quietly becoming a weighty investor in Asia, with multinationals like Hyundai and Samsung proving to be tenacious matches for Japanese, American and European companies in China and elsewhere in the region.
 South Korea has emerged as perhaps the largest single source of foreign investment in China, making $6.25 billion in fixed investments there last year, according to data from the Chinese Ministry of Commerce. And as investor attention swivels to India, South Korea's largest steel company, Posco, has agreed to make the largest Korean investment in another country, in a $12 billion iron mine and steel mill in the Indian state of Orissa.
Though it is overshadowed by the Asian giants China and Japan, South Korea has grown to become the 11th-largest economy in the world. Reflecting the nation's increased affluence and economic strength, Korean manufacturers are now looking abroad to achieve the powerful growth rates they only recently enjoyed at home, from exports and rising domestic demand. Much of this interest is supported by a strengthening currency, the won, which gained more than 15 percent against the dollar in 2004. 
 In a sea change, the government now says that to invest abroad is to be patriotic.
 ''Before, investment going in was good, and anything going out was bad,'' said Alan Timblick, a British citizen who directs Invest Korea, a government agency that has a new role: encouraging foreign investment. ''Now, the companies are outsourcing their labor-intensive work, and moving up the technology ladder at their home base.''
 American investors in Asia, long used to Japanese competition, increasingly find themselves up against South Korean companies.
 ''In some dynamic areas, Korea is competing on the same level with the U.S. and Japan: shipbuilding industry, cellphones, automobiles,'' said Moon Hwy Chang, professor of international business at Seoul National University. ''Korea cannot be a center for manufacturing any more because labor costs are rising. So Korea wants to be kind of a Switzerland at the center of northeast Asia -- a center for finance, transportation, communication.''
 An economic casualty of wars and occupation a half-century ago, South Korea has grown aggressively, in the 1980's registering an average annual growth rate of 8.7 percent.
 But more recently, its economy has looked increasingly mature. In the first half of this year, South Korea recorded a 3 percent growth pace, better than in Japan but lower than the United States. It is expected to achieve a growth rate of about 4 percent this year.
 Korean exports soared 31 percent in 2004, but grew 7.3 percent in the first six months of this year.
 Meanwhile, workers worry about a jobless recovery, employers say auto factory wages are approaching American levels, and almost everyone complains of soaring housing and land prices.
 ''South Korean wages have gotten too high to support a whole range of activities,'' said Edward M. Graham, a Korea trade and investment specialist at the Institute for International Economics in Washington. ''The firms are keeping in South Korea the areas where they have a comparative advantage -- the higher-tech, more capital-intensive businesses.''
 Indeed, in a familiar echo of worker complaints heard in the United States and Japan, Korean labor unions now accuse companies of exporting their jobs. Union leaders at Hyundai, the country's biggest automaker, have made the company's foreign investment plans an issue in wage negotiations this fall.
 South Korea's outward investment thrust is most evident in steel, cars, cellphones and energy. And the main target is China, where more than 30,000 South Korean companies now do business.
 This push into China last year did not attract much attention, perhaps because, according to the Chinese Commerce Ministry, the top three sources of foreign investment were Hong Kong, the British Virgin Islands and South Korea. But Hong Kong is part of China, and investments from the Virgin Islands are often conduits for money from a number of countries and sources, leaving South Korea as most likely the largest single source of foreign investment in China last year.
 In 2004, Korean investment in China, mostly in steel and cars, overtook Japan's, which has an economy six times that of South Korea's. 
 Many Koreans say their country has an edge over Japanese companies in China because it does not face the hostility from World War II and before. ''Sino-Korean relations date back 5,000 years,'' Chey Tae Won, chairman of the SK Corporation, South Korea's largest energy company, told a recent economic forum in Shanghai. Mr. Chey vowed to build ''another SK'' in China. By 2010, SK hopes to earn $5 billion a year from China, up from $2 billion this year. Of this, 60 percent would come from local companies there, with the rest from SK exports to China. 
 Although the SK Corporation generated $13.1 billion in sales outside South Korea last year, few Americans have heard of this Korean multinational. And SK Telecom, South Korea's largest mobile phone service provider, has cellphone ventures in Mongolia, China and Vietnam. But that was just a first step: a joint venture with EarthLink aims to begin mobile phone and wireless Internet services in the United States by the end of the year.
 Samsung, South Korea's largest company, employs 50,000 workers in 29 factories in China.
 ''In the Chinese market, we are increasingly doing the R&D design work locally, hiring local people in the top management,'' said Woosik Chu, the head of investor relations for Samsung, which is best known in the United States for its flat-screen television sets and other consumer electronics. ''So that way, the Chinese consumers feel as if it's their own brand.''
 Only capital-intensive components -- largely semiconductors and liquid crystal display screens -- are still made in South Korea. 
 In China's highly competitive car market, the Hyundai Motor Company has succeeded in becoming the most popular foreign line, according to sales figures for the first half of 2005. Hyundai plans to double its capacity in China to 600,000 a year. Kia Motors, a Hyundai affiliate, makes about 150,000 cars a year in China.
 With plans for new plants in China, India, Turkey, the Czech Republic and the United States, Hyundai is on track to expand its overseas production to 50 percent at the end of the decade, from a recent 28 percent. Over the last 18 months, Hyundai's foreign sales rose 55 percent, while domestic sales increased 5 percent.
 American carmakers are amply aware of the Hyundai challenge. In May, Hyundai opened its first American factory, a $1.1 billion assembly plant in Alabama. It helped increase Hyundai sales in the United States for the first eight months of the year by almost 11 percent, to nearly 311,000 vehicles, more than the sales of BMW or Volkswagen. 
 South Korean multinationals are also believers in the huge potential in the largest developing countries: Brazil, Russia, India and China.
 Posco, the steel giant, has invested in 55 companies around the world, including 24 steel companies in China. Its India project, when completed, is expected to produce 12 million tons of steel a year, creating 48,000 direct and indirect jobs. In northern Brazil, Posco is studying a proposal by Companhia Vale do Rio Doce to build a 7.5-million-ton steel slab plant.
 With China now curbing new investments in steel, Posco has an edge over Japanese companies. Many of the Japanese delayed investing in the 1990's because of huge debt problems at home. At that time, Posco and other Korean steel makers started to go to China.
 ''The big difference we had over the Japanese mills,'' said Kim Joon-Sik, manager of Posco's China and corporate strategic planning departments, ''was entrepreneurship and pioneering spirit.''

HEADLINE: A Journey to a Thousand Maps Begins With an Open Code

BYLINE: By DAMON DARLIN

 BODY:
A Google map is no longer just a Google map. 
 You can still search Google Maps to figure out how to get from here to there, but why would you, when you can use it to pinpoint kosher restaurants in Cincinnati, traffic cameras in Dublin, or hot spring spas anywhere in the United States? How about finding coffee shops in Seattle that provide free wireless Internet access? Or would you prefer to locate the McMansion your boss just bought and find how out exactly how much he paid for it?
An army of programmers, most of them doing it just for fun, has grabbed the software code that generates the distinctive maps with their drop-shadowed virtual pushpins, and combined it with other data like the locations of potholes, taco trucks and U.F.O. sightings, and even the sites of murders and muggings. 
 The result is Google map mash-ups, the latest form of Internet information repackaged for entertainment and, perhaps, profit. For instance, type the official airline flight abbreviation and flight number into the Google search engine and FBOweb .com should come up at the top of the results page. Click on that and you will see a pushpin marking the spot where the plane is. The service also provides a data box listing the speed, altitude and estimated time of arrival of the flight. 
 Another service, Homepricerecords .com, combines the home sales data with a Google map when you type in an address. (It currently has data only for homes in the San Francisco and Los Angeles areas, but the service promises that Chicago and New York data are coming soon.) 
 No one really knows how many Google map mash-ups are out there, and it is difficult to hazard a guess on how many new ones are created each day. But that does not stop some bloggers from desperately racing to keep up with the latest. Mike Pegg, an account manager for a software company in Waterloo, Ontario, is one of them. He created Google Maps Mania (www.gmapsmania.com) several months ago in a quixotic attempt to chronicle the phenomenon. 
 Almost every day he lists a dozen new ones, ranging from the commonplace, like sex offender maps, to the esoteric, like bird sightings in India. ''I am their press release,'' Mr. Pegg said. 
 Why are people doing this? The flippant answer is also the honest one: because they can. Google has revealed the map-generating software, called an A.P.I., or application programming interface. (You can find it at www.google.com/apis/maps/.) And with that A.P.I., a programmer can create a mash-up by combining it with other data -- like apartment listings on Craigslist, or demographic data from the United States census. The programming technique, itself a mash-up of programs, is also known as Ajax, for Asynchronous JavaScript and XML.
 Mash-ups are not a new phenomenon on the Web. Musicians have been doing something similar with other artists' songs for some time. The best-known example is DJ Danger Mouse's combination of the Beatles' ''White Album'' with Jay-Z's ''Black Album'' last year to yield ''The Grey Album.'' Online, Hopstop.com combines subway and bus directions in New York, Boston and Washington with a database of restaurants and entertainment spots. 
 What is new is that big companies are encouraging users to tap into the information. Amazon has been allowing entrepreneurs to hijack parts of its database and software code to create new applications like MusicPlasma, which graphically displays connections between various musical artists. (Type in the band Weezer and a constellation of other bands, like Nirvana, Nine Inch Nails and Zwan, surround it). The site, recently renamed Liveplasma .com, has created a similar search tool for movies and -- no surprise -- has a free mapping feature for its habitues.
 ''It is happening so fast,'' said Jef Poskanzer, a longtime programmer in Berkeley, Calif., who has created a hot springs map as well as maps of old star forts in Paris, a yacht race and public transportation systems in Paris and the San Francisco Bay area. ''This is like the 1990's, when everyone was creating everything on the Web.'' 
 The difference, he said, is that it is now even more democratic because it is so simple to do. ''It still takes a programmer to write these kinds of Google maps, but it is easier because you can go to another site and copy the code,'' he said.
 It just got a lot easier. A company started by Marc Andreessen, a co-founder of Netscape, hopes to democratize map mash-ups even more. He created Ning .com, which automates the tools needed to create a Google-based map so almost anyone can make one. 
 Once you have registered for ''developer status,'' the site copies the code behind a particular Web site you want to imitate, allowing you tweak it and make it your own. In less than five minutes, you could have the Mung Bean Salad Restaurant site up and running.
 Google recognized while developing the mapping feature that it would not have the time or the desire to create a host of special interest maps. Yet having numerous mash-ups would serve Google's strategy of becoming the ubiquitous organizer of the world's information -- hence its openness. The company made it economically and technically feasible for Web sites to present data in map form, said Bret Taylor, product manager for Google Local. 
 Yahoo has opened the A.P.I.'s behind several of its Web services, including Flickr, its photo-storing site; Yahoo Shopping; and Yahoo Maps. Even Microsoft, which has been guarded about sharing its code, has released the A.P.I. for its mapping feature. But Google Maps caught on fastest and now seems to have the greatest number of developers writing for it. (Exactly how many, Google said, is a closely guarded secret.) 
 Mr. Taylor said one reason for the Google Maps' popularity may be that Google allows mash-up creators to share in the revenue from ads that Google sells and places on sites. (In fact, in exchange for allowing use of the maps, Google reserves the right to run ads on the sites in the future.) ''It's great for the developer and it's great for Google,'' Mr. Taylor said.
 A new class of entrepreneur is jumping in as well. Pete Flint, a 2004 graduate of Stanford University's business school, and a classmate, Sami Inkinen, started a mash-up called Trulia.com, which pinpoints real estate listings on a Google map. Click on a pushpin in a favorite neighborhood and up pops the listings, along with comparables from recent home sales and other nearby properties. 
 Trulia has posted data only for five California cities, and that data is a bit thin because it uses publicly available sources like newspapers and Web sites, not the Multiple Listing Service, the copyrighted databases belonging to local broker associations. Trulia plans on adding additional layers of information, like census data. 
 But it is already easy to see the income-earning possibilities, either through advertising or generating highly specific leads for real estate agents. ''We very much follow the Google model,'' Mr. Flint said. ''It is just a much more focused model of the Google search engine.''
 Google's openness to the use of its maps does have limits, though. Once a mash-up turns into a large-scale commercial enterprise, Google looks to share in the revenue. That is happening at Trulia; Google lawyers are trying to negotiate a royalty agreement. ''At the moment it is free,'' Mr. Flint said, ''and we are taking advantage of it.''

HEADLINE: Dow Jumps 128 in Rally Aided by Fed and Oil Price

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Stocks surged yesterday, with the Dow Jones industrials gaining 128 points as a decline in oil prices and a reassuring assessment of the economy helped investors overcome their disappointment over Intel's earnings and pessimistic sales forecasts.
 Intel's profits and a warning of slow fourth-quarter sales rattled investors who had hoped for more bullish forecasts from corporate America. But the market drew solace late in the day from the Federal Reserve, which in its regular beige book breakdown of the economy said many parts of the country were still seeing decent growth despite high energy prices. 
 Stocks were helped by falling crude oil futures after the Energy Department reported larger-than-expected inventories of crude oil, gasoline and heating oil. 
 ''There are some signs on the wall here that we may have hit the bottom of this market, and we could be ready to move up,'' said Chris Johnson, manager of quantitative analysis at Schaeffer's Investment Research in Cincinnati. ''The big question, though, is how far we move up and how long it lasts.''
 The Dow rose 128.87 points, or 1.25 percent, to 10,414.13. Broader stock indicators also moved higher. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index climbed 17.62, or 1.5 percent, to 1,195.76, while the Nasdaq composite index rose 35.24, or 1.71 percent, to 2,091.24. 
 Bonds built on the previous session's gains, with the yield on the 10-year Treasury note falling to 4.46 percent, from 4.47 percent, and the price, which moves inversely to the yield, rising 3/32, to 98 11/32, late Tuesday. The dollar was lower against most major currencies, while gold prices also fell. 
 The Commerce Department said new housing construction rose to an annualized rate of 2.108 million units, greater than the 1.975 million economists expected and a possible sign of a pickup in the cooling housing market. 
 In earnings news, Intel's revenues were below Wall Street's forecasts despite strong sales of laptop computers. But it was the fourth-quarter outlook, which included warnings of slower sales, that caused nervous investors to sell off the stock, which was down sharply in early trading but finished the session down just 3 cents, to $23.69. 
 The disappointment over Intel was mitigated by positive earnings reports in the technology sector. Yahoo rose $2.21, to $35.91, after beating analysts' profit expectations by a penny a share on a 47 percent increase in sales. Motorola climbed 85 cents, to $21.02, on news that its quarterly profits tripled. 
 The Altria Group gained $1.37, to $73.85, after reporting a 9 percent increase in profit. The conglomerate also said its Philip Morris USA division had more than 50 percent of the cigarette market. 
 J.P. Morgan Chase took advantage of a strong stock market in the third quarter, increasing its quarterly earnings 78 percent. It also announced that Jamie Dimon will take over as chief executive six months early. The stock added 96 cents, to $34.73. 
 Also in the financial sector, Bank of America rose 87 cents, to $42.44, after posting a 10 percent increase in quarterly profits on the strength of its credit card and mortgage businesses. 
 Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by nearly 2 to 1 on the New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 2.06 billion shares, compared with 1.64 billion shares traded on Tuesday.

HEADLINE: No Real Bile, Just a Cool Look at Hot Air in Tinseltown 

BYLINE: By NED MARTEL

 BODY:
Even in a slow time on the political calendar, ''The Daily Show'' on Comedy Central finds ways to subject Washington mores to some New Yorky intensity. But when David Spade takes on Los Angeles for his lazy, unfocused project, ''The Showbiz Show,'' on Comedy Central, he seems like all the other comics out there whose brains have baked in the city's sunshine and self-regard.
 Since the debut last month of his show, broadcast on Thursday nights at 10:30, Eastern and Pacific times; 9:30, Central time, Mr. Spade and his producers have been wasting an opportunity to send up Tinseltown pomposity the way the ''Daily Show'' host, Jon Stewart, has done with the Beltway crowd. 
Where Mr. Spade could have been an acerbic, informed commentator, he comes off instead as a televised shock jock, more in tune with the knuckle-dragging anger that Adam Carolla has brought to Comedy Central with his new series, ''Too Late With Adam Carolla.''
 On ''The Daily Show,'' a pent-up energy is always palpable, as Mr. Stewart's team tries extra hard to elucidate as they lacerate. They seem aware that the mainstream media and the political brawlers know how to fight back, so they'd better get their own facts straight, and that self-protection only solidifies their satire. 
 In Mr. Spade's reports from inside the entertainment capital, however, he adopts a coolly defensive pose, like he is just checking this gig out, when he really could coast on paychecks from his roles in the films ''Joe Dirt'' (2001) and ''Dickie Roberts, Former Child Star'' (2003). In one demonstration of his own ambivalence, he sets up an episode this way: ''Welcome to 'The Showbiz Show.' It's where I burn every bridge in Hollywood to make you laugh for only 30 minutes.''
 Hey, pal, don't do us any favors. After all, there are already plenty of places to hear jokes about kabbalah, Scientology, trendy ring tones, Michael Jackson's skin tones, the emaciated figure of Lindsay Lohan, the satiated figure of Star Jones. Plus, there's no need for such constant, desperate attention to female breasts, as Mr. Spade makes little beeping noises when green arrows point them out on red-carpet photos.
 Mr. Spade calls the stars he skewers ''the people you hate to love,'' but he doesn't get to the root of the fascination, nor does he challenge the industry that makes money off the gaffes and peccadilloes of these famous faces. In fact, ''The Showbiz Show'' is just trying to get its own cut of the action.
 Maybe Mr. Spade is by nature just a follower, as he has long played a flippant, dismissive foil to more powerful co-stars. He was once the elfin sidekick to the rotund Chris Farley, in reprises of their Frick-and-Frack ''Saturday Night Live'' routines in movies like ''Tommy Boy'' (1995) and ''Black Sheep'' (1996). Mr. Spade did prove marketable as a smaller half of that whole; after Mr. Farley's death in 1997, Mr. Spade's own schlocky movies found a sizable audience. 
 In more recent roles, Mr. Spade has done versions of the service-economy drone, who sasses the boss and puts the customer last. On a signature ''Saturday Night Live'' skit, he issued sneering ''bub-bye'' to deplaning passengers. On the television series ''Just Shoot Me,'' he was a scheming office manager. The same spiel pervades a haranguing credit-card campaign that he has been on lately.
 ''The Showbiz Show'' is a bigger shame because Mr. Spade has talent, plus the perfect network to satirize the perfect topic at the perfect time. Celebrity fascination has gotten ''ridic,'' as he would say, and the up-close-and-personal mewling that actors and musicians do to promote new projects seems to be just waiting to be annotated, howled at and exposed for hypocrisy -- just as ''The Daily Show'' scribes do with Capitol Hill hearings and White House news conferences.
 In the few moments when he's at his best, in the show's ''There, I Said It'' segments, Mr. Spade accuses Gwyneth Paltrow of ''backhand bragging'' for whining about being away from her daughter during film shoots. Many Americans, Mr. Spade opined, can't even afford a baby sitter to go to see her latest leaden movie.
 ''We already know you're too good for us,'' he said, lampooning her move to London. ''America will try to handle losing you and Madonna in the same decade. We'll somehow pull together and absorb the hit as a nation.'' 
 This format gives him more time to complete his zingers and shows far more promise than other retoolings of ''The Daily Show's'' ''Weekend Update'' shticks. The worst part of ''The Showbiz Show'': Jessi Klein's recurring commentaries, where she shows up in geeky Tina Fey glasses to dump on everyone, including Mr. Spade.
 ''Whatever. Get outta here,'' he retorts, waving Ms. Klein away with his typical heavy-lidded pose. At least he can take an occasional joke. But the new host needs to prove he can tell a few better ones, especially the kind that could help downgrade Hollywood's sky-high opinion of itself.

HEADLINE: Pretoria Calling

BYLINE: By Dennis Ross. 
Dennis Ross, envoy to the Middle East in the Clinton administration, is counselor of the Washington Institute for Near East Policy and the author of ''The Missing Peace.''

DATELINE: Washington 

 BODY:
THE Palestinian leader, Mahmoud Abbas, has a credibility problem that his visit with President Bush is unlikely to help: how to convince his people that violence against Israel will not lead to an independent Palestinian state. While Mr. Abbas must certainly show that he can deliver for his people, he needs help in discrediting Hamas and other terrorist groups. And one of the best sources for that help is not in Washington, Brussels or Riyadh, but in Pretoria. Indeed, South Africa's experience can provide valuable inspiration for the culture of peace that Mr. Abbas says he hopes to create.
 Yasir Arafat loved to equate the Palestinian struggle for statehood with the struggle of South Africans against apartheid, but his was always a false analogy. In South Africa, less than 15 percent of the population controlled all the power and wealth and subjected the other 85 percent to a degrading, inhuman and segregated existence. For the oppressed majority, the answer was not one state for non-whites and one for whites; rather, the goal was justice and majority rule. 
Compare that to the Palestinian movement for self-determination. Arabs today remain a minority in the area that encompasses Israel, the West Bank and Gaza. To be sure, given demographic trends, Jews will become a minority in that area within this decade, but even by 2050, Arabs would outnumber Jews by only 60 percent to 40 percent. 
 The international community supports a two-state solution because it recognizes that there are two national movements with populations in rough equality. That was never the case in South Africa. And while Palestinians have endured occupation and a denial of their rights, their commitment to violent struggle has sadly perpetuated this condition and stymied their national aspirations.
 Why raise the South African comparison today? Because Palestinians respect the South African model but are not learning from it. For all of Arafat's comparisons to the African National Congress, it did not have an ideology of violence: although the congress attacked the military and economic underpinnings of apartheid, it forswore attacks on civilians and generally expelled those members who violated that policy. 
 In contrast, no Palestine Liberation Organization member has ever been drummed out for violence against Israelis. As the price of joining the Oslo process, Arafat renounced terrorism, but he never delegitimized it; he never called those who carried out terrorist acts against Israeli enemies of the Palestinian cause. 
 I don't mean to idealize the African National Congress. But the Palestinians urgently need a credible and effective role model for assuming responsibility and rejecting violence. First, they must act in Gaza to prove that they can govern themselves and fulfill their responsibilities, including their security responsibilities. Second, they now have a leader, Mr. Abbas, who rejects violence but lacks Arafat's revolutionary authority and is being challenged by Hamas, which claims that Gaza vindicates the resort to terrorism. Arab leaders -- who could have an impact -- remain nowhere to be found. 
 The South Africans are far less reticent, especially in challenging those who call for violence, and they are likely to be taken seriously by the Palestinian public. I know from my conversations with members of South Africa's government in Pretoria this summer that they are interested in playing a role -- an interest that they have signaled in several venues, including meetings with Palestinian and Israeli officials. Now is perhaps the time for a visit to Ramallah by Thabo Mbeki, South Africa's president, to share his country's experience and its lessons for the Palestinians.
 No one can question whether South Africans struggled. No one can doubt the moral authority of their words. And no one can more forcefully offer a successful and nonviolent pathway to national liberation and a government of basic decency.

HEADLINE: Taking a Cue From Ferrer, Mayor Issues Housing Plan

BYLINE: By THOMAS J. LUECK; Diane Cardwell contributed reporting for this article.

 BODY:
Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg yesterday outlined a plan to preserve or build an additional 100,000 homes for the poor and middle-income families, moving to grab the spotlight from his opponent, Fernando Ferrer, on a central issue in the mayoral race.
 The mayor's proposal would more than double the amount of housing envisioned in a city program he launched in 2002, and its broad scope surprised many housing advocates. If completed by 2013, as called for in the proposal, it would be the largest 10-year housing program ever financed by the city, the mayor said.
Reaction to the plan included skepticism from Mr. Ferrer, who has proposed creating or preserving roughly 167,000 units of housing. Yesterday, Mr. Ferrer appeared with Andrew M. Cuomo, a former federal housing secretary, to criticize Mr. Bloomberg's first-term record on housing development, and suggested that the new proposal, which does not include new taxes, is underfinanced. 
 Having a new plan ''by definition suggests that the old plan isn't working,'' said Mr. Cuomo, who came out to support Mr. Ferrer's flagging campaign a day before it was expected to receive another boost: former President Bill Clinton plans to campaign with the Democratic nominee today.
 Housing advocates, meanwhile, welcomed the mayor's proposal yesterday, saying it reflected a new reality in mayoral politics.
 ''It is just great that both candidates have put ambitious plans on the table,'' said Brad Lander, director of the Pratt Center for Community Development. He said both plans reflect ''the clarity of need for housing, and its salience as a political issue.''
 The mayor's proposal, which would include a huge infusion of cash from private sources and create a new city bonding authority to construct large middle-income apartment buildings, differs in many ways from the plan put forward by Mr. Ferrer, which would depend in part on a property tax increase on vacant residential land.
 But both plans reflect a shift in the economics of housing since the last large wave of low- and middle-income housing development, which began under Mayor Edward I. Koch in the late 1970's at a time when neighborhoods were littered with derelict buildings and vacant lots ready for fresh use. Now, with nearly all the available city-owned property used up, the problem is where to build.
 Mr. Koch, who appeared yesterday with the mayor in Manhattan, called Mr. Bloomberg's new proposal ''Herculean.''
 Mr. Bloomberg, adopting language strikingly similar to that used by Mr. Ferrer, said the city now faced a ''housing affordability crisis.'' Mr. Ferrer has been campaigning on the theme of a ''crisis of affordability'' for months.
 Under the mayor's plan, a five-year program that was started in 2002 to create or preserve 68,000 homes by 2008 would be expanded to create or preserve 165,000 homes by 2013. The 10-year plan would cost $7.5 billion, the mayor said.
 Mr. Bloomberg's plan called for the creation of a new city agency to finance construction of rental buildings similar to those now operated by the state as Mitchell-Lama housing, a state program that has long provided lower-cost apartments for New Yorkers. The Bloomberg plan would use tax-free municipal financing to create 22,000 apartments in large buildings, and they would be offered to families with incomes ranging from $50,000 to $100,000 a year at about 25 percent less than prevailing rental rates.
 The plan also calls on the city to fill a void expected when state and federal subsidies expire for a housing program for the elderly and about 37,000 existing apartments under the Mitchell-Lama program.
 Mr. Bloomberg said the city had identified some parcels of vacant or little-used city-owned land that could be used for new housing, including the 61-acre parcel in Hunters Point, Queens, that had been staked out as a site for the Olympic Village, and would seek other property to buy from private owners.
 He said the plan would also emphasize a greater use of inclusionary zoning, in which developers of market-rate housing are allowed to put up larger buildings if they include homes for low- and moderate-income people in their projects.
 Areas already picked out by the city for inclusionary zoning include Greenpoint and Williamsburg in Brooklyn, and western Chelsea and the Hudson railyards in Manhattan.

HEADLINE: No Progress at Trade Talks 

BYLINE: By TOM WRIGHT

DATELINE: GENEVA, Oct. 19 

 BODY:
Negotiations for a global trade accord ended without progress on Wednesday, with the United States saying the European Union had failed to match its offer to cut agricultural support.
 The United States trade representative, Rob Portman, said it was increasingly unlikely that a deal would be reached at a crucial World Trade Organization meeting in December.
''Given the short time before the Hong Kong ministerial, the E.U.'s lack of urgency is very concerning,'' Mr. Portman said. ''They, like the U.S., have a responsibility to help move the talks forward with a strong, ambitious proposal. We've done our part, and the U.S. will continue pushing for the E.U. to do theirs.'' 
 The United States broke an impasse in the talks, which began in Doha, Qatar, in 2001, with an offer last week to cut its farm subsidies by 60 percent and import duties on agricultural products by 55 to 90 percent. The United States asked the European Union to respond by opening its markets by the same degree to America's farm products.
 But negotiators said that the European Union trade commissioner, Peter Mandelson, who this week drew criticism from France for going too far in the talks, made no new offer on tariff cuts on Wednesday. A proposal from Brussels is expected at the end of next week.
 Representatives from the United States, Europe, India, Brazil and Australia were originally scheduled to convene again Thursday but decided to conclude the meeting early.
 France's trade minister, Christine Lagarde, reiterated concerns Wednesday that Mr. Mandelson had overstepped his negotiating mandate by agreeing last week to expand cuts in Europe's subsidies. 
 Developing nations led by Brazil are demanding Western countries give up the tens of billions of dollars they spend each year to support farmers. This system, these nations say, encourages overproduction, and pushes down global commodity prices.
 A group of Western African nations threatened Wednesday to block a deal unless the United States makes concrete strides to cut cotton subsidies, which the W.T.O. has already ruled illegal. African protests on cotton were a factor in the failure of the W.T.O.'s last major gathering in Cancun, Mexico, two years ago.
 Mr. Mandelson this week urged European nations to support a new trade agreement. Further lowering barriers to trade, he said, could be worth an extra $100 billion to the global economy each year.

HEADLINE: Roots in the Far East, Doing Deals in the West 

BYLINE: By James Flanigan. 
E-mail: jamesflanigan@nytimes.com

 BODY:
DAVID LEE passed a small milestone this month when he closed a deal to buy three office buildings in the Airport Center complex near Los Angeles International Airport for $70 million.
 By coincidence, the purchase brought to 70 the number of office buildings he has acquired for Jamison Properties, the real estate investment and management company he started 10 years ago to make tax-deferred investments for himself and eight other Korean immigrant doctors and dentists.
 Today Jamison, which also owns 13 medical office buildings and 6 shopping centers, buys and manages real estate for 100 investors -- ''90 percent of them Korean,'' Mr. Lee said. The company controls 20 million square feet of space worth $3 billion, making Jamison the largest owner of commercial property in Los Angeles County and Mr. Lee the most notable exemplar of Southern California's growing and furiously entrepreneurial Korean community. 
 Yet Mr. Lee, who came to the United States from Seoul, South Korea, 34 years ago at age 17 and trained in internal medicine at Northwestern University Medical School, is relatively little known outside his ethnic and professional circles. A modest, quiet-spoken man, he is no Donald Trump.
 That is not necessarily a disadvantage. ''He is under the radar,'' said John Cushman, chairman of Cushman & Wakefield, the real estate company. ''And that's a good place to be. It allows him to buy property at low prices.''
 Bargain hunting is an art the doctor has practiced since buying his first office building on Wilshire Boulevard in 1995. Los Angeles was under a cloud at the time in the aftermath of riots in 1992, brush fires in 1993 and an earthquake in 1994. Insurance companies were selling half-empty buildings at knockdown prices, seeing no way the economy would revive.
 But David Lee knew that a hidden market existed among Korean immigrant entrepreneurs, many of them recent arrivals who had been forced into early retirement in corporate restructurings back home. Lacking a credit rating in America but rich with severance and retirement bonuses, they had cash to pay the rent for office space for businesses to serve the city's fast-growing Korean population, which is pushing 300,000 today, up from 190,000 in 1990. 
 Coming to the United States as adults, often nearing middle age and with few English-language skills, these newcomers have become renowned for a hard-charging desire to own businesses. And some see deeper historical roots to the phenomenon. ''Koreans are like many people who were poor and colonized for centuries; they want to prove something to themselves and to others,'' said Charles Rim, a Korean-born, U.C.L.A.-educated accountant who has recently been investing in land for residential development in Ventura and Santa Barbara Counties.
 Today, that first building that Mr. Lee bought 10 years ago is worth five times the $6 million he paid for it. And he has repeated that process many times since, promising investors a 15 percent annual return and achieving it partly by cutting maintenance costs but mostly by sitting back and watching commercial property prices boom along with the Southern California economy.
 He still has a nose for deals, like snapping up Airport Center for a price per square foot that is 20 percent to 50 percent below the going rate for good office space in Los Angeles. ''The airport area is the weakest market because politicians can't decide how they're going to change or expand LAX,'' he said. But he has time to wait for such matters to sort themselves out. ''We invest on a six-to-seven-year cycle,'' Mr. Lee said, ''where most investors are on a three-to-five-year cycle.''
 He also knows when to bide his time. Aside from Airport Center, Jamison Properties is not buying much these days because prices are approaching replacement value for buildings and, he says, ''I like to buy below replacement value.''
 What to do with investors' money? Mr. Lee says he is collaborating with eight other people to start a bank next spring called the Premier Business Bank that will cater ''to wealthy professionals, doctors, lawyers and businesspeople who need personal financial services.'' 
 That will put him in good company. Four fast-growing Korean banking companies in Los Angeles -- the Center Financial Corporation, the Hanmi Financial Corporation, Nara Bancorp and Wilshire Bancorp -- have assets of $8 billion. They are thriving in part by supplying credit to the hundreds of Korean-owned garment companies and other businesses that are ''inspired by Mr. Lee's success and buying the real estate in the downtown garment district,'' according to Jack Kyser, an economist at the Los Angeles County Economic Development Corporation. 
 Some Korean-owned enterprises are becoming prominent on a wider stage. One Korean immigrant, Don Chang, for example, has built Forever 21 Inc., based in Los Angeles, into a successful national chain of clothing stores for teenage girls. The Korean-born Sabrina Kay built her California Design College into a successful business in the 1990's teaching computerized design and pattern-making to young people seeking jobs in the garment industry. Ms. Kay, 40, sold the college in 2002 to the Education Management Corporation in Pittsburgh for about $15 million, and she has now started Fremont Private Investments Inc., a venture-capital firm for start-ups.
 She has some ideas for new companies. ''One is for a gallery featuring modern Asian art, from China and Korea,'' she said
 She is also looking to back a new kind of trans-Pacific company that brings together manufacturing in China or South Korea with fashion design in Los Angeles. And she wants to start a financial-services firm catering to entrepreneurs in Southern California's ethnic communities. 
 Ms. Kay is a co-founder with Mr. Lee of the Premier Business Bank but they are the only Korean partners in the bank. ''Business here in Southern California is multicultural,'' Mr. Lee said.
 For future growth, ''Korean businesses will need access to institutional capital markets and major corporate relationships,'' says Stewart Kim, a former managing director of Merrill Lynch in New York, who founded an investment banking firm, PGP Capital Advisors, in Los Angeles in 1995.
 Mr. Kim, a graduate of Dartmouth and the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, sees relationships increasing between American and South Korean companies. PGP Capital helped arrange a wireless communication joint venture this year between Earthlink, the Atlanta Internet service provider, and SK Telecom of Seoul, a cellular telecommunications company, for example. 
 With a daughter and two sons at the University of Southern California and another son in high school, Mr. Lee, 51, is thinking ahead. Will his children be joining him in the business? ''If they like money, they will be,'' he responds with a smile. ''If they don't like money, they will be nonprofit.''
 He worries, though, whether the entrepreneurial spirit will be diluted over future generations. He cites a Korean saying that the first generation makes the money, the second generation spends it and the third is back where the first started. Not having seen the Kennedy name on magazine lists of the superrich, he wonders: ''What about the Kennedys? Did that family stay rich after Joseph Kennedy?'' 
 And so Mr. Lee and many in the Korean entrepreneurial community are moving from a traditional Korean story and becoming an American one.

This column about small-business trends in California and the West appears on the third Thursday of every month.

Broadway

'ABSURD PERSON SINGULAR' An uninspired revival of Alan Ayckbourn's classic farce of marital misery and Christmas cheerlessness, directed by John Tillinger. The largely merely serviceable cast includes Paxton Whithead, Mireille Enos and the wonderful Deborah Rush, who sidesteps the usual cliches of playing drunk in splendid comic style (2:30). Biltmore Theater, 261 West 47th Street, (212)239-6200. (Ben Brantley).

'CHITTY CHITTY BANG BANG' The playthings are the thing in this lavish windup music box of a show: windmills, Rube Goldbergesque machines and the show's title character, a flying car. It's like spending two and a half hours in the Times Square branch of Toys ''R'' Us (2:30). Hilton Theater, 213 West 42nd Street, (212)307-4100. (Brantley)

'DIRTY ROTTEN SCOUNDRELS' On paper this musical tale of two mismatched scam artists has an awful lot in common with ''The Producers.'' But if you are going to court comparison with giants, you had better be prepared to stand tall. ''Dirty Rotten Scoundrels,'' starring John Lithgow and Norbert Leo Butz, never straightens out of a slouch (2:35). Imperial Theater, 249 West 45th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)

*'DOUBT, A PARABLE' (Pulitzer Prize, Best Play 2005, and Tony Award, Best Play 2005) Set in the Bronx in 1964, this play by John Patrick Shanley is structured as a clash of wills and generations between Sister Aloysius (Cherry Jones), the head of a parochial school, and Father Flynn (Brian F. O'Byrne), the young priest who may or may not be too fond of the boys in his charge. The play's elements bring to mind those tidy topical melodramas that were once so popular. But Mr. Shanley makes subversive use of musty conventions (1:30). Walter Kerr, 219 West 48th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)

'LATINOLOGUES' Created and written by Rick Najera and directed by Cheech Marin, long since de-Chonged, this is a series of loosely linked monologues delivered in character by Mr. Najera and three other talented Latino performers. Mr. Najera and his compadres can be skillful slingers of one-liners, but the characters cooked up to transmit them are neither fresh nor fully realized. In contrast to the colorfully individualized portraits in John Leguizamo's solo shows, the men and women of ''Latinologues'' are composites of worn, easy stereotypes (1:30). Helen Hayes Theater, 240 West 44th Street, (212)239-6200. (Charles Isherwood)

'THE LIGHT IN THE PIAZZA' Love is a many-flavored thing, from sugary to sour, in Adam Guettel and Craig Lucas's encouragingly ambitious and discouragingly unfulfilled new musical. The show soars only in the sweetly bitter songs performed by the wonderful Victoria Clark, as an American abroad (2:15). Beaumont Theater, Lincoln Center, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)

'A NAKED GIRL ON THE APPIAN WAY' Could it be that the exhaustingly prolific Richard Greenberg has been even busier than anyone suspected? This clunky farce about the limits of liberalism, directed by Doug Hughes and starring a miscast Richard Thomas and Jill Clayburgh, suggests that Mr. Greenberg has been moonlighting as a gag writer for sitcoms and is now recycling his discarded one-liners (1:45). American Airlines Theater, 227 West 42nd Street, (212)719-1300. (Brantley)

'SPAMALOT' (Tony Award, Best Musical 2005) This staged re-creation of the mock-medieval movie ''Monty Python and the Holy Grail'' is basically a singing scrapbook for Python fans. Such a good time is being had by so many people that this fitful, eager celebration of inanity and irreverence has found a large and lucrative audience (2:20). Shubert Theater, 225 West 44th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)

'SWEET CHARITY' This revival of the 1966 musical never achieves more than a low-grade fever when what's wanted is that old steam heat. In the title role of the hopeful dance-hall hostess, the appealing but underequipped Christina Applegate is less a shopworn angel than a merry cherub (2:30). Al Hirschfeld Theater, 302 West 45th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)

*'THE 25TH ANNUAL PUTNAM COUNTY SPELLING BEE' The happy news for this happy-making little musical is that the move to larger quarters has dissipated none of its quirky charm. William Finn's score sounds plumper and more rewarding than it did Off Broadway, providing a sprinkling of sugar to complement the sass in Rachel Sheinkin's zinger-filled book. The performances are flawless. Gold stars all around. (1:45). Circle in the Square, 1633 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212)239-6200. (Isherwood)

Off Broadway

*'ALTAR BOYZ' This sweetly satirical show about a Christian pop group made up of five potential Teen People cover boys is an enjoyable, silly diversion (1:30). Dodger Stages, Stage 4, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212)239-6200.(Isherwood)

'BEOWULF' Bob Flanagan's luminous puppets of lizards and fish are wonderful, but they are relatively tangential to a so-called rock opera that is not sure whether it wants to be a children's show or ''Jesus Christ Superstar,'' and fails at both. Humans who are less animate than the puppets try to sing their way through an uninspired enactment of the great epic (1:15). Irish Repertory Theater, 132 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212)727-2737. (Anne Midgette).

'THE BLOWIN OF BAILE GALL' Ronan Noone's play concerns the complicated relationships among four laborers and a general contractor renovating a house in Ireland. Mr. Noone draws his characters sharply and surely, but the play is overburdened with conflict. There's enough here to fuel a whole season of a television soap (2:00). Irish Arts Center, 553 West 51st Street, Clinton, (212)868-4444.(Isherwood)

'CYCLING PAST THE MATTERHORN' A grating comedy-drama by Deborah Grimberg about the fractious relationship between a mother and daughter. Shirley Knight plays Esther, a needy, needling woman who discovers that she's going blind just as her daughter leaves the nest. Carrie Preston is her needy, self-absorbed daughter (1:35). Harold Clurman Theater on Theater Row, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212)279-4200.(Isherwood)

'DRUMSTRUCK' This noisy novelty is a mixed blessing. Providing a two-foot drum on every seat, it offers an opportunity to exorcise aggressions by delivering a good beating, and on a slightly more elevated level, it presents a superficial introduction to African culture, lessons in drumming and 90 minutes of nonstop music, song and dancing by a good-natured cast (1:30). Dodger Stages, Stage 2, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212)239-6200.(Lawrence Van Gelder)

'EINSTEIN'S GIFT' Vern Thiessen's potentially moving play about two German-Jewish Nobel winners -- the physicist Albert Einstein and the chemist Fritz Haber -- their differing conceptions of science's role and the martial use to which their work is put, is marred by unnecessary ''Odd Couple'' exchanges and a miscast Haber, but benefits from good performances by Shawn Elliott as Einstein and Melissa Friedman as Haber's wife (2:00). Acorn Theater on Theater Row, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212)279-4200. (Andrea Stevens)

* 'FORBIDDEN BROADWAY: SPECIAL VICTIMS UNIT' This production features the expected caricatures of ego-driven singing stars. But even more than usual, the show offers an acute list of grievances about the sickly state of the Broadway musical, where, as the lyrics have it, ''everything old is old again'' (1:45). 47th Street Theater, 304 West 47th Street, Clinton, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)

'THE GREAT AMERICAN TRAILER PARK MUSICAL' A terrific cast keeps the generator running in this bright but flimsy contraption. A few of David Nehls's dozen ditties raise a hearty chuckle, like the valedictory anthem in which the show's heroines collectively vow to ''make like a nail and press on.'' But Betsy Kelso's book all but dispenses with plot, and substitutes crude cartoons for characters (2:00). Dodger Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212239-6200. (Isherwood)

*'IN THE CONTINUUM' A spirited, smart and powerful portrait of two black women whose lives are suddenly upended by an H.I.V. diagnosis. Written by and starring Danai Gurira and Nikkole Salter, who both possess the strong presence and confident technique to bring out the subtle force and potent flavoring in their writing (1:30). 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, we only use street locators for avenues.(212)279-4200. (Isherwood)

'MARION BRIDGE' The Canadian playwright Daniel McIvor takes a quiet, honest look at three sisters as they face their mother's death. It is well acted and well directed, if too predictable in spots (2:20). Urban Stages, 259 West 30th Street, (212)868-4444. (Margo Jefferson)

'THE MASTER BUILDER' A revival that succeeds mainly through a fine performance by Dan Daily as the superstar architect of the title. Mr. Daily brings the character's tangle of contradictions together in a credible performance that manages to find the hidden troll in the artistic genius (2:20). Pearl Theater, 80 St. Marks Place, East Village, (212)598-9802.(Wilborn Hampton)

'THE MUSICAL OF MUSICALS!' The musical is the happy narcissist of theater; parody is the best form of narcissism. All it needs are smart writers and winning performers. That's what we get in this case (1:30). Dodger Stages, Stage 5, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212)239-6200. (Jefferson)

'ONE-MAN STAR WARS TRILOGY' With a storm trooper roaming the aisles and a woman in an Obi-Wan Kenobi get-up telling theatergoers to turn off their cellphones or they will be turned into ''cosmic dust,'' Charles Ross's sprint through Episodes IV through VI strives for the atmosphere of a ''Star Wars'' convention, but ends up achieving something like a religious revival (which is sort of the same thing). True believers will love how Mr. Ross, a self-confessed geek who plays every major role in under an hour, simulates R2D2, but everyone else will scratch their heads (1:00). Lamb's Theater, 130 West 44th Street, (212)239-6200. (Jason Zinoman)

*'ORSON'S SHADOW' Austin Pendleton's play, about a 1960 production of Ionesco's ''Rhinoceros,'' which was directed by Orson Welles and starred Laurence Olivier, is a sharp-witted but tenderhearted backstage comedy about the thin skins, inflamed nerves and rampaging egos that are the customary side effects when sensitivity meets success (2:00). Barrow Street Theater, 27 Barrow Street, Greenwich Village, (212)239-6200. (Isherwood)

*'SIDES: THE FEAR IS REAL' This hilarious collection of sketches may send up familiar targets -- the insecure thespian, the fraudulent acting teacher, the arrogant Juilliard grad -- but since it's performed with such specificity and comic charm by actors firing on all cylinders, you won't care a whit. Written by and starring an entirely Asian-American cast, this slight but consistently entertaining satire is a primer on what not to do in an audition room (1:15). Culture Project, 45 Bleecker Street, at Lafayette Street, East Village, (212)307-4100. (Zinoman)

'SLUT' This overamplified musical comedy about love and promiscuity among East Village friends leans heavily on obscenities to lend it a daring edge. Instead, it swamps even its brightest moments in tawdriness (2:00). American Theater of Actors, 314 West 54th Street, Clinton, (212)239-6200. (Miriam Horn)

*'A SOLDIER'S PLAY' This movingly acted revival of Charles Fuller's Pulitzer-Prize winning drama from 1981, directed by Jo Bonney and featuring Taye Diggs, uses the clean-lined conventions of murder mysteries to elicit unsettlingly blurred shades of racism, resentment and self-hatred (1:55). Second Stage Theater, 307 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (212)246-4422. (Brantley).

*'THOM PAIN (BASED ON NOTHING)' Is there such a thing as stand-up existentialism? If not, Will Eno has just invented it. Stand-up-style comic riffs and deadpan hipster banter keep interrupting the corrosively bleak narrative. Mr. Eno is a Samuel Beckett for the Jon Stewart generation (1:10). DR2 Theater, 103 East 15th Street, Flatiron district, (212)239-6200. (Isherwood)

'WALKING DOWN BROADWAY' Dawn Powell's 1931 tale of young people looking for life and love in New York is packed with smart dialogue and honest emotions. It is also well directed, well acted and smartly designed (2:30). Mint Theater, 311 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (212)315-0231. (Jefferson)

'WAR IN PARAMUS' It is supposedly 1970 in Barbara Dana's new family drama, but you'd hardly know it from the generic troubles on display: two clueless parents, two polar-opposite daughters, two crises that could be from any time between the 1950's and today, only obligatory references to the war and the strife of the period (1:20). Abingdon Theater Arts Complex, June Havoc Theater, 312 West 36th Street, (212)868-4444. (Neil Genzlinger).

Off Off Broadway

'THE ASPHALT KISS' Everything in Nelson Rodgrigues's play is exaggerated, from the deliberately melodramatic situation to the repetitive language, enunciated with Mamet-like emphasis. The strange intensity of the play, with its consciously stilted dialogue and acting, may not be to everyone's taste. But this production is an intriguing sample of Rodrigues's highly original voice (1:30). 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, (212)279-4200. (Phoebe Hoban)

'BELLY OF A DRUNKEN PIANO' In this splendidly imperfect cabaret, Stewart D'Arrietta howls and growls convincingly through Tom Waits's three-decade song catalog, backed by a snappy trio. His patter and his piano playing are variable, but Mr. D'Arrietta makes a genial tour guide through Mr. Waits's wee-hours world (1:45). Huron Club at SoHo Playhouse, 15 Vandam Street, between Avenue of the Americas and Varick Street, (212)691-1555. (Rob Kendt)

'SAINT OEDIPUS' Combines actors and puppets with Greek and Christian myth to create a fierce, virtuosic theater piece (1:10). The Wierszalin Theater of Poland at La MaMa E.T.C., 74A East Fourth Street, East Village, (212)475-7710. (Jefferson)

'WICKED' Oz revisited, with political corrections (2:45). Gershwin Theater, 222 West 51st Street, (212)307-4100. (Brantley)

Last Chance

* 'CRESTFALL' Taking place in a town described by one character as ''this insidious vicinity, the savage quarter, this perpetual crestfall,'' this speeding train of a play, which features three interconnected monologues spoken by a sex addict, a frigid woman and a whore, reveals a writer who loves words almost as much as he does dirty jokes and bloody faces. Since he made his first American splash with ''Howie the Rookie'' in 2001, Mark O'Rowe, who writes likes a mix of Samuel Beckett and Martin McDonagh, has grown in confidence, if not in maturity (1:15). 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, (212)279-4200, closing Sunday. (Zinoman)

'LATE FRAGMENT' Matthew, a World Trade Center employee who survived Sept. 11, and Marta are a desperate couple falling out of love in Francine Volpe's often perceptive if muddled drama, titled after a Raymond Carver poem. Under the direction of Michael Imperioli (Christopher from ''The Sopranos'') and Zetna Fuentes, the play has a wobbly style, building tension only to diffuse it with less-than-credible moments (1:30). Studio Dante, 257 West 29th Street, Chelsea, (212)279-4200, closing tomorrow. (Zinoman)

'THE MARILYN TAPES' This doting biographical musical sticks to the highlights of Marilyn Monroe's life with a concentration on romance. Even if Lenore Zann isn't exactly the spit and image of Monroe -- which the Bert Stern photographs in the lobby make clear -- fans of the star will find her mannerisms and, most impressively, her agile, breathy voice quite convincing (1:30). Blue Heron Arts Center, 123 East 24th Street, (212)352-3101, closing Sunday.(Zinoman)

*'MEDEA' Sure, she gets most of the attention, but let's take a moment to acknowledge Jason, who, as embodied by Lawrence Winslow in the Classical Theater of Harlem's jolting production, contributes some terrific laughs to Euripides' grim tragedy. Yeah, that's right: laughs, the kind you get from the incongruity of the good ol' boys' network's encountering Gloria Steinem (1:10). Classical Theater of Harlem, at the Harlem School of the Arts Theater, 645 St. Nicholas Avenue, near 141st Street, (212)868-4444, closing Sunday. (Genzlinger)

'THE PAVILION' Craig Wright's play about the speedy wheels of time's winged chariot and the dreams it grinds into dust is set at a small-town high school reunion. Brian D'Arcy James aches with longing as the cad who wants a second chance. Gracefully directed by Lucie Tiberghien (2:00). Rattlestick Theater, 224 Waverly Place, at 11th Street, West Village, (212)868-4444, closing Sunday.(Isherwood)

Movies

Ratings and running times are in parentheses; foreign films have English subtitles. Full reviews of all current releases, movie trailers, showtimes and tickets: nytimes.com/movies.

*'THE ARISTOCRATS' (No rating, 89 minutes) A rigorously scholarly documentary about the theory and practice of joke-telling that also happens to be one of the filthiest, vilest, most extravagantly obscene movies ever made -- and one of the funniest. (A.O. Scott)

'BEFORE THE FALL' (No rating, 110 minutes, in German) Dennis Gansel's intensely beautiful film brings us inside one of Hitler's elite schools (used to indoctrinate future leaders) to observe the fate of a young amateur boxer and his sensitive roommate. Though somewhat overdetermined, the film is a chilling testament to the seductiveness of groupthink and the allure of imagined superiority.(Jeannette Catsoulis)

*BROKEN FLOWERS' (R, 105 minutes) Sweet, funny, sad and meandering, Jim Jarmusch's new film sends Bill Murray's aging Don Juan out in search of a son he never knew he had. He finds four former lovers, including Sharon Stone and Jessica Lange, and reveals once again that he is the quietest and finest comic actor working in movies today. (Scott)

* 'CAPOTE' (R, 114 minutes) Philip Seymour Hoffman's portrayal of Truman Capote is a tour de force of psychological insight. Following the novelist as he works on the magazine assignment that will become ''In Cold Blood,'' the film raises intriguing questions about the ethics of writing. (Scott)

*'THE CONSTANT GARDENER' (R, 129 minutes) A superior thriller with a conscience, from John le Carre's novel. (Scott)

*'DOMINO' (R, 113 minutes) A lollapalooza of delectable cheap thrills from Tony Scott about the real life and nasty-girl times of a privileged London brat turned South Central bounty hunter named Domino Harvey. (Manohla Dargis)

'EVERYTHING IS ILLUMINATED' (PG-13, 104 minutes) From Jonathan Safran Foer's novel, a sentimental Holocaust tale; tender and funny in places, but also thin and soft. (Scott)

'FLIGHTPLAN' (PG-13, 93 minutes) To watch Jodie Foster storm through a phony airplane as a mother in search of her missing child has its very minor pleasures, but there is nothing in this thrill-free thriller to feed the head or fray the nerves. (Dargis)

'THE FOG' (PG-13, 100 minutes) This occasionally scary remake is about a dense, mysterious fog that hides vengeful spirits with a century-old grudge against an Oregon seaside town. At least there's a good-looking young cast, led by Tom Welling of ''Smallville'' and Maggie Grace of ''Lost.'' (Anita Gates)

*'THE 40-YEAR-OLD VIRGIN' (R, 111 minutes) A sex comedy turned romantic bliss-out, with Steve Carell, in which the sound of one prophylactic snapping is just a single sweet note in the glorious symphony of love. (Dargis)

*'GOOD NIGHT, AND GOOD LUCK' (PG, 90 minutes) George Clooney, with impressive rigor and intelligence, examines the confrontation between the CBS newsman Edward R. Murrow (a superb David Strathairn) and Senator Joseph R. McCarthy (himself). Plunging you into a smoky, black-and-white world of political paranoia and commercial pressure, the film is both a history lesson and a passionate essay on power, responsibility and the ethics of journalism (Scott)

'THE GREATEST GAME EVER PLAYED' (PG, 115 minutes) A rousing, obvious re-creation of the 1913 United States Open, in which two sons of the working classes faced off in a game still dominated, on both sides of the Atlantic, by the well-born. Aims for par and makes it. (Scott)

*'GRIZZLY MAN' (R, 103 minutes) Werner Herzog's bold, enthralling documentary about one man's journey into the heart of darkness (and the belly of the beast) traces the life and strange times of the self-anointed grizzly expert Timothy Treadwell. (Dargis)

* 'A HISTORY OF VIOLENCE' (R, 97 minutes) A masterpiece of indirection and pure visceral thrills about a seemingly average American family almost undone by cataclysmic violence, David Cronenberg's latest mindblower is the feel-good, feel-bad movie of the year. With Viggo Mortensen, Maria Bello, Ed Harris and William Hurt, all excellent. (Dargis)

* 'IN HER SHOES' (PG-13, 130 minutes) In his newest film, Curtis Hanson wrests a richly textured story of love from a seemingly unlikely source, Jennifer Weiner's breezy, best-selling fiction about two sisters -- played by Cameron Diaz and Toni Collette -- engaged in an epic battle of the heart, a fight waged mostly against each other and their own best interests. (Dargis)

'INNOCENT VOICES' (R, 120 minutes, in Spanish) Alternately powerful and mawkish, ''Innocent Voices'' remembers the civil war in El Salvador in the 1980's through the eyes of an 11-year-old boy from a rural village who faces forcible conscription into the army. (Stephen Holden)

'JUST LIKE HEAVEN' (PG-13, 95 minutes) Reese Witherspoon's disembodied spirit haunts Mark Ruffalo in a real estate dispute that runs into a sweet romantic comedy. Surprisingly lighthearted and brisk, considering its fairly morbid premise.(Scott)

'LOGGERHEADS' (No rating, 95 minutes) There is so much that is tender and true in Tom Kirkman's sensitively acted film about adoption that the few times it pauses to flaunt its metaphorical conceit about loggerhead turtles, you just have to grit your teeth and wait for the twitches of literary pretension to subside. (Holden)

'MAGNIFICENT DESOLATION: WALKING ON THE MOON 3D' (No rating, 40 minutes) Tom Hanks narrates this Imax film that tries to give moviegoers the virtual experience of being on the lunar surface. At times it comes close. (Gates)

'MIRRORMASK' (PG, 101 minutes) This British film, directed by Dave McKean from a screenplay by Neil Gaiman, blends live action with computer-generated animation by the Jim Henson Company into a provocative, murky surrealism. The story follows the Freudian nightmare of a 15-year-old girl whose parents work in the circus; it's strictly for cultists. (Holden)

*'NINE LIVES' (R, 115 minutes) The director Rodrigo Garcia's suite of fleeting but intense moments in the lives of nine women is an extraordinarily rich and satisfying film, the cinematic equivalent of a collection of Chekhov short stories. The brilliant cast includes Sissy Spacek, Robin Wright Penn, Holly Hunter and Amy Brenneman. (Holden)

* 'OLIVER TWIST' (PG-13, 130 minutes) Roman Polanski's take on Dickens's classic emphasizes the darkness and cruelty of Victorian society. Vigorous and precise, it is a vivid reminder of the novelist's power as both a storyteller and a social critic. (Scott)

* 'THE PRIZE WINNER OF DEFIANCE, OHIO' (PG-13, 99 minutes) Julianne Moore is radiant as Evelyn Ryan, the real-life 1950's Ohio housewife and mother of 10 who kept her family afloat on her winnings from television jingle contests. Jane Anderson wrote and directed this tribute in a wonderfully zany, off-center style. (Holden)

'ROLL BOUNCE' (PG-13, 107 minutes) A drowsy comedy from Malcolm D. Lee about a handful of kids grooving and roller skating in the summer of 1978, ''Roll Bounce'' has heart and good vibes but little else to recommend it. (Dargis)

'SEPARATE LIES' (R, 87 minutes) A hit-and-run accident near the country house of an imperious British lawyer (magnificently played by Tom Wilkinson) leads him into an ethical labyrinth that tests his moral mettle as well as that of his wife (Emily Watson) and her lover (Rupert Everett). (Holden)

'SERENITY' (PG-13, 119 minutes) It probably isn't fair to Joss Whedon's ''Serenity'' to say that this unassuming science-fiction adventure is superior in almost every respect to George Lucas's aggressively more ambitious ''Star Wars: Episode III -- Revenge of the Sith.'' But who cares about fair when there is fun to be had? Scene for scene, ''Serenity'' is more engaging and certainly better written and acted than any of Mr. Lucas's recent screen entertainments. (Dargis)

* 'THE SQUID AND THE WHALE' (R, 88 minutes) Mining his own childhood, Noah Baumbach has put together an unsparing, funny portrait of a family in crisis and a young man trying to figure out his parents and himself. Superbly written and acted, especially by Laura Linney and Jeff Daniels as a pair of divorcing writers. (Scott)

'TIM BURTON'S CORPSE BRIDE' (PG-13, 90 minutes) A necrophiliac animation for the whole family about a melancholic boy, the girl he hopes to marry and the bodacious cadaver that accidentally comes between them. (Dargis)

'TWO FOR THE MONEY' (R, 122 minutes) A turgid male weepie in which Matthew McConaughey plays a former college quarterback turned sports-betting guru under the loud tutelage of Al Pacino's odds-making kingpin. (Dargis)

* 'WALLACE & GROMIT: THE CURSE OF THE WERE-RABBIT' (G, 85 minutes) The stop-motion pooch and his cheese-loving master, back again at feature length. Silly and sublime. (Scott)

'WHERE the TRUTH LIES' (No rating, 107 minutes) Atom Egoyan's drama about a fictional comedy team from the 1950's features an overly knotty murder mystery, a mess of blondes and two fine performances from Kevin Bacon and Colin Firth. (Dargis)

(Gates)

(Gates)

Pop

Full reviews of recent concerts: nytimes.com/music.

ACID MOTHERS TEMPLE (Tonight) The manic Japanese guitarist Kawabata Makoto leads his long-running band in hard-rocking psychedelic explorations rooted in riffy dirt-rock. 7:30, Canal Room, 285 West Broadway, at Canal Street, TriBeCa, (212)941-8100; $12 in advance, $15 at the door. (Laura Sinagra)

BEHOLD THE ARCTAPUS, THE ILLEGIBLE DJ CAPS (Sunday) Behold the Arctapus plays smart heavy metal.

Hexa also play. 8 p.m., Knitting Factory Tap Bar, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212)219-3006; $10 in advance, $12 at the door. (Sinagra)

JELLO BIAFRA AND THE MELVINS (Sunday) The sardonic frontman of the former California punk band the Dead Kennedys now pops up frequently as a talking head for music nostalgia documentaries. Teaming with the proto-grunge Seattle rockers the Melvins, he's still playing jokester on albums like ''Sieg Howdy'' (Alternative Tentacles). 8 p.m., Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, East Village, (212)353-1600; $17. (Sinagra)

JON BRION (Tuesday) This multi-instrumentalist and producer's scrapped (but widely downloaded) material for Fiona Apple's new CD created a stir. Now he takes time off from such sonic midwifery, film scoring and playing gigs weekly at a Los Angeles cabaret to display his own versatile pop prowess. 7:30 and 10 p.m., Canal Room, 285 West Broadway, at Canal Street, TriBeCa, (212)941-8100; $20 in advance, $25 at the door. (Sinagra)

TRACY CHAPMAN (Tonight) This singer-songwriter's angsty pop-folk song ''Fast Car,'' a kind of anti-''Born To Run,'' became an instant classic when late-1980's recession sank in, offering a working-class escape fantasy so modest that it was heartbreaking. 6:30, Hammerstein Ballroom, 311 West 34th Street, Manhattan, (212)564-4882; $39. (Sinagra)

BRUCE COCKBURN (Tomorrow) The smoky-voiced Canadian folk-rocker Bruce Cockburn is just as opinionated and oppositional as he was when he wrote the anti-imperial ''If I Had a Rocket Launcher,'' though recently he has been letting his guitar do the emoting. 8 p.m., Society for Ethical Culture, 2 West 64th Street, Manhattan, www.concertstonight.com, (212)307-7171 ;$30 to $35.(Sinagra)

CREAM (Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday) All the members of the 60's British power trio behind ''White Room,'' and ''Badge'' are alive and well, but top dollar is required to see if Eric Clapton's slow hand has gotten slower, or the bassist Jack Bruce's bellow less blustery. Ginger Baker's drumming remains agile. 8 p.m., Madison Square Garden, (212)465-6741 ; $64.50 to $354.50. (Sinagra)

VICENTE FERNANDEZ (Tonight) In Mexico, Vicente Fernandez is a household name, a television star who owes his fame to songs about loving, crying and suffering. With his dramatic tenor voice and his wall-shaking vibrato, Mr. Fernandez brings out all the melodrama of Mexican ranchera songs that bounce and laugh as they detail vast heartaches. 8, Madison Square Garden, (212)465-6741; $54.50-$149.50. (Jon Pareles)

ORENDA FINK (Tomorrow) One-half of the ethereal female duo Azure Ray, Ms. Fink performs her own songs, atmospheric alt-rock that draws on her travels to Haiti, Cambodia and India. She opens for the former Soul Coughing frontman Mike Doughty. 7 p.m., Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, East Village (212)353-1600; $20. (Sinagra)

FREAKWATER, JOHN PARISH (Thursday) Catherine Irwin and Janet Beveridge Bean of Freakwater harmonize like a country duo from decades ago, calmly examining all the disappointments and morbid fantasies -- heartache, suicide, children's deaths -- of a hard life in the boondocks. Now and then, a proudly clever line signals that they're not as rural as they might sound. John Parish has been an essential collaborator for P.J. Harvey and the Eels, playing guitar and keyboard parts distilled to a stark simplicity. 9 p.m., Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, at Ludlow Street, Lower East Side, (212)260-4700; $12. (Pareles)

GANGBE BRASS BAND (Tomorrow) This 10-piece band from Benin in West Africa melds upbeat Yoruban music with global jazz and pop, singing in several of Benin's indigenous languages and French. 10 p.m., Zankel Hall at Carnegie Hall, (212)247-7800; $25 to $37. (Sinagra)

PATTERSON HOOD (Tuesday) One of three songwriters in his southern-rock band, the Drive-by Truckers, Patterson Hood possesses an eclectic pop sensibility that perfectly balances his bandmates' honky-tonk jams and southern-gothic anthems. 7:30 p.m., Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, at Ludlow Street, Lower East Side, (212)260-4700; $14. (Sinagra)

JAMIROQUA (Monday and Tuesday) Taking its cues from Stevie Wonder, this British dance-pop band led by the madly hatted singer Jay Kay had a hit in the 90's with the blandly groovy ''Virtual Insanity,'' and gained more a jam-band than a dance-music following. 9 p.m., Nokia Theater, 1515 Broadway, at 44th Street; ticketmaster.com or (212)307-7171; $40. (Sinagra)

JOHN LEGEND (Thursday) The piano-romancing crooner John Legend, a dapper Kanye West protege, plays retro soul music with hip-hop cred and a teasingly rough edge. 8 p.m., Apollo Theater, 253 West 125th Street, Harlem, (212)749-5838 or (212)864-0372; $45 to $65. (Sinagra)

MAGIK MARKERS (Tomorrow) This noise-rock trio's sound assaults build from shirring buzz and ominous clang to maelstroms of bash and feedback. Kicking and jerking as the spirit moves her, the vocalist-guitarist Elisa Ambrogio surges from hiss to howl, wrestling with her guitar to choke out its most dangerous peals. The group plays between the Ex-Models and Pterodactyl. 10- p.m., Tonic, 107 Norfolk Street, near Delancey Street, Lower East Side, (212)358-7503; $8. (Sinagra)

JAMES MCMURTRY (Tomorrow and Sunday) James McMurtry packs a lot of story into his low-key songs: tales of loners and losers adrift in wide-open spaces. His voice is deadpan, but his characters survive grand struggles. 8 p.m., Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, at Ludlow Street, Lower East Side, (212)260-4700; $15. (Pareles)

MILTON NASCIMENTO (Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday) Since his heyday in the early 1970's, the versatile Brazilian singer and songwriter Milton Nascimento has been making experimental jazz-pop that often features inventive vocal improvisations. 8 p.m., Blue Note, 131 West Third Street, Greenwich Village, (212)475-8592; $30.(Sinagra)

ONEIDA (Tonight) The Brooklyn noise-rockers Oneida are a versatile bunch, sliding album to album from hard squall to heavy riffs to Krautrock precision--and, more recently, to droning meditations that seem a sonic correlate to time-lapse images of gathering storm clouds. 9:30, Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, at Ludlow Street, Lower East Side, (212)260-4700; $10. (Sinagra)

THE RAPTURE (Tonight) This Brooklyn band tops its tight dance-punk grooves with the rhythmically yelping panic of the vocalist Luke Jenner, whose tone recalls the Cure's Robert Smith. 9, Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212)533-2111; $17 in advance, $20 at the door. (Sinagra)

THE ROGERS SISTERS, SCOUT NIBBLET (Wednesday) Though the Brooklyn power-trio the Rogers Sisters have plied their perky new-wave craft during the recent spate of 80's revivalism in Williamsburg, they take themselves less seriously than most. Scout Nibblet makes stripped-down alt-rock in the vein of early P.J. Harvey. 9:30 p.m., Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, at Ludlow Street, Lower East Side, (212)260-4700; $10 in advance, $12 at the door. (Sinagra)

ANOUSHKA SHANKAR (Thursday) The sitarist Anoushka Shankar, who has up to this point been an aesthetic acolyte of her father's lithe, neo-traditional take on improvisatory raga, has recently been experimenting with a combination of acoustic and electronic backing instrumentation. 7 and 9:30 p.m., Joe's Pub, at the Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212)539-8770; $30. (Pareles)

STEW (Monday) This Los Angeles pop craftsman writes songs that slip just enough bitters into the 70's lite rock cocktail to make it subversive.

Mr. Thompson, one of the architects of British trad-rock in the 1960's, writes songs steeped in Celtic melody and the stoicism of traditional ballads.

MARTHA WAINWRIGHT (Tuesday) Like her parents, Kate McGarrigle and Loudon Wainwright, the folk singer-songwriter Martha Wainwright can be roundly sad or quippishly tart.

(Sinagra)

ZAKK WYLDE BLACK LABEL SOCIETY (Wednesday) Mr. Wylde, the heavy-metal guitarist best known for his stints with Ozzy Osbourne's band, is outspoken on matters of sex, beer and country.

 Opera

'AIDA' (Tomorrow and Wednesday) The Metropolitan Opera's big-time revival of ''Aida'' is well worth a trip, first for the strong cast, including Salvatore Licitra, but also for the over-the-top spectacle. Tomorrow at 1:30 p.m., Wednesday at 8 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212)362-6000; sold out tomorrow; $26 to $175 remaining on Wednesday. (Bernard Holland)

'ARIANE ET BARBE-BLEUE' (Tomorrow) Paul Dukas's mysterious 1907 opera tells the legend of Duke Bluebeard and his disappearing wives from a woman's point of view. That this rich work has become a rarity is inexplicable. Thanks go to the New York City Opera for this new production, suitably Symbolist in look. 8 p.m., New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212)721-6500; $16 to $120. (Anthony Tommasini)

'IL BARBiERe DI SIVIGLIA' (Tomorrow) The New York City Opera's production of this Rossini classic is an efficient, attractive frame for the composer's florid score, and the company has a generally strong cast, with Hugh Russell as Figaro, Jennifer Rivera as Rosina and John Tessier as the Count. 1:30 p.m., New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212)721-6500; $16 to $120. (Allan Kozinn)

'LA CENERENTOLA' (Monday) Olga Borodina's mezzo-soprano is slightly dark for the title role in Rossini's Cinderella story, but she has the clarity and agility to bring this virtuosic, richly ornamental music to life. The rest of the cast is well matched in this comic-book production by Cesare Lievi. 8 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212)362-6000; $26 to $175. (Kozinn)

'COSI FAN TUTTE' (Tonight and Tuesday) It's always a pleasure to re-encounter the director Lesley Koenig's handsome and insightful 1996 production of Mozart's bittersweet exploration of romantic fidelity, or lack thereof.

James Levine conducts. 8 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212)362-6000; $26 to $205. (Tommasini)

'FALSTAFF' (Tomorrow) This is the last chance this season to see an unusually fine production: well cast, well acted and well conducted by James Levine. Bryn Terfel, authoritative if unsubtle, is matched note for note by the fabulous Stephanie Blythe as Mistress Quickly; also excellent is Patricia Racette as Alice Ford. 8 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212)362-6000; $42 to $150. (Anne Midgette)

'LUCIA DI LAMMERMOOR' (Thursday) Nicolas Joel's production of Donizetti's most popular opera seemed pointlessly opulent, murky, confusing and cluttered when it was first presented by the Metropolitan Opera in 1998.

The cast, which looks to be strong, includes Elizabeth Futral as the mentally fragile Lucia.

'LA TRAVIATA' (Tomorrow and Sunday) The venerable Amato Opera may seat scarcely more than 100, but it can't be accused of cowardice. This weekend it begins a run of one of the hardest operas for soprano in the repertory, Verdi's ''Traviata.'' Tomorrow night at 7:30, Sunday afternoon at 2:30, 319 Bowery, at Second Street, East Village, (212)228-8200; $30; students and 65+, $25. (Midgette)

(Eichler)

(Oestreich)

SERGEY SCHEPKIN (Tomorrow) Well known as a Bach specialist, this pianist begins the Metropolitan Museum's season-long series Piano Forte, which juxtaposes composers with more or less in common: Beethoven and Schubert, Chopin and Rachmaninoff, and -- with Mr. Schepkin and others -- Bach and Brahms. 8 p.m., Grace Rainey Rogers Auditorium, Metropolitan Museum of Art, (212)570-3949; $40 (Oestreich)

(Rockwell)

SCOTT HERON & JODI MELNICK (Wednesday through Oct. 29) Two veteran artists on an appealing double bill. The always imaginative Ms. Melnick presents events that ''may or may not have happened'' in ''Wanderlust, Kentucky,'' and Mr. Heron performs the irresistibly titled ''Flossing''-- in which he will apparently assume the dual personas of a box of dental floss and the tooth fairy. Also on the program are ''3X Donovan'' and a premiere, ''Gumdrops and Cupcakes.'' 7.30 p.m., Dance Theater Workshop, 219 West 19th Street, Chelsea, (212)924-0077 or www.dtw.org; $20; students, ages 65+ and artists, $12.

(Dunning)

Museums and galleries are in Manhattan unless otherwise noted. Full reviews of recent art shows: nytimes.com/art.

 Museums

AMERICAN FOLK ART MUSEUM: 'OBSESSIVE DRAWING,' through March 19. In the museum's first ''emerging talent'' show, one of the five artists selected is 83, lives in a home for the elderly in Pennsylvania and stopped painting two years ago because of failing eyesight. Overall, the work in the exhibition is abstract and spare, giving the problematic outsider category a new spin. 45 West 53rd Street, (212)265-1040. (Holland Cotter)

COOPER-HEWITT NATIONAL DESIGN MUSEUM: 'EXTREME TEXTILES,' through Oct. 30. Don't look for aesthetic pizazz in this intensely techy show of industrial fibers and fabrics, but don't rule it out. The show's raison d'etre is solely use, but a lot of what's on view, in the first museum display of material made to function in extreme conditions, is visually exciting. 2 East 91st Street, (212)849-8400.(Grace Glueck)

*THE FRICK COLLECTION: 'MEMLING'S PORTRAITS,' through Dec. 31. Just over 30 portrait paintings by Hans Memling survive from the 15th century. Of those, about 20 are now on view at the Frick Collection. That's a whale of a lot of paintings by any major early northern European artist to be in any one place at one time, and there is little question that this show -- two compact rooms of compact pictures, each picture a main event -- will figure on any short list of outstanding events of the year. 1 East 70th Street, (212)288-0700. (Cotter)

GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM: 'RUSSIA!,' through Jan. 11. This survey of nine centuries of Russian art ranges from 13th-century religious icons to a smattering of 21st-century works, achieving its astounding effect without resorting to a single egg, or anything else, by Faberge. It immerses us in two enormous, endlessly fascinating narratives: the history of painting and the history of Russia, forming a remarkable tribute to the endurance of the medium and the country, and the inescapable interconnectedness of art and life. 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212)423-3600. (Roberta Smith)

*JAPAN SOCIETY: 'HIROSHI SUGIMOTO: HISTORY OF HISTORY,' through Feb. 19. A very personal, whimsical exhibition by this well-known Japanese photographer, who incorporates into his work artifacts that he has collected, particularly from East Asia and Japan. Mr. Sugimoto's reach is long, and his range is broad, from fossils to textiles to undersea dioramas to Japanese calligraphy to the Trylon and Perisphere (a minisculpture) that symbolized the New York World's Fair of 1939. It may not be all that enlightening, but as an artist's personal survey, it comes off. 333 East 47th Street, (212)832-1155. (Glueck).

*JEWISH MUSEUM: 'THE JEWISH IDENTITY PROJECT: NEW AMERICAN PHOTOGRAPHY,' through Jan. 29. Who's Jewish, who isn't, and, by the way, what is a Jew, anyway? They are not easy questions, as this intense who-are-we exploration makes clear. Ten projects by 13 artists try to help break the stereotype of American Jews as uniformly white, middle-class and of European descent. Using photography and video, they have interpreted their missions broadly, from the Korean-born Nikki S. Lee's meticulous staging of a Jewish wedding with herself as the bride, to Andrea Robbins and Max Becher's look at the thriving shtetl established by Lubavitcher Hasidic Jews in the rural community of Postville, Iowa. 1109 Fifth Avenue, at 92nd Street, (212)423-3200. (Glueck)

METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'THE BISHOP JADES,' through Feb. 12. Jade has been treasured since ancient times, though the almost preposterously exquisite objects on display in the Met's reinstalled galleries for Chinese decorative arts date from the 18th century, when the Qing dynasty (1644-1911) brought Chinese jade work to a peak of virtuosity. Fifth Avenue and 82nd Street, (212)535-7710. (Cotter)

EL MUSEO DEL BARRIO: 'THE (S) FILES/THE SELECTED FILES 05,' through Jan. 29. The definition of what ''Latino art'' means is changing in a post-identity-politics time, and this modest biennial, drawn mostly from unsolicited proposals submitted by artists in the greater New York area, is an indicator of what that change looks like. 1230 Fifth Avenue, at 104th Street, (212)831-7272. (Cotter)

MUSEUM OF BIBLICAL ART: 'THE NEXT GENERATION: CONTEMPORARY EXPRESSIONS OF FAITH,' through Nov. 13. Works in this juried show of artists who belong to the organization Christians in the Visual Arts range from traditional paintings and sculptures to an interactive video-and-photo documentation of a shamanistic performance in the woods. Ambitious, optically captivating collages by Mary Fielding McCleary and Anita Breitenberg Naylor are among the few pieces that exceed familiar generic limitations. 1865 Broadway, at 61st Street, (212)408-1500. (Ken Johnson)

MUSEUM OF THE CITY OF NEW YORK: 'NEW YORK CHANGING: DOUGLAS LEVERE REVISITS BERENICE ABBOTT'S NEW YORK,' through Nov. 13. During the 1930's, the Modernist photographer Berenice Abbott photographed the architectural fabric of New York with a keen eye for contrasts of new and old. Between 1997 and 2003, Douglas Levere returned to the scenes that she photographed and photographed them again. Seeing 50 of his paired with her originals is a fascinating education in how things change. 1220 Fifth Avenue, at 103rd Street, (212)534-1672. (Johnson)

NATIONAL MUSEUM OF THE AMERICAN INDIAN: 'FIRST AMERICAN ART,' through April 9. That American Indian art can provide the same aesthetic and emotional pleasure as European and American Modernism is the premise of this show, made up of 200 objects from the Charles and Valerie Diker Collection, and it affirms American Indian art's worthy aesthetic place in world culture. 1 Bowling Green, Lower Manhattan, (212)514-3700. (Glueck)

QUEENS MUSEUM OF ART: 'DOWN THE GARDEN PATH: THE ARTIST'S GARDEN AFTER MODERNISM,' through Nov. 6. This big, messy and uneven show, still a thought-provoking one for patient and interested viewers, surveys how artists like Vito Acconci, Ian Hamilton Finlay, Mel Chin, Ghada Amer, Stan Douglas and many more have cultivated gardens in fantasy and in reality. Flushing Meadows-Corona Park, (718)592-9700.(Johnson)

*WHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART: 'OSCAR BLUEMNER: A PASSION FOR COLOR,' through Feb. 12. Not exactly a well-known name today, except to devotees of American Modernism, this German-born architect-turned-painter (1867-1938) was, in fact, one of the major American artists of the early 20th century, right up there with the likes of Marsden Hartley, John Marin, Arthur Dove and Charles Demuth, to name a few. Most of his compositions are unpeopled landscapes depicting houses and building fragments in brilliantly stylized settings in which trees, clouds, smokestacks, telephone poles, water and snow are rendered as rhythmic and dramatic shapes that play off one another almost musically. 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (212)570-3676. (Glueck)

Galleries: Uptown

'Yinka Shonibare Selects: Works from the Permanent Collection' A British sculptor of Nigerian descent organizes an absorbing small exhibition of objects related to travel from the Cooper Hewitt collection, and adds his own oblique comment on 19th-century imperialism in the form of two headless female mannequins in Victorian-style dresses cut from African-patterned fabrics, poised on six-foot stilts strapped to their feet. Smithsonian's Cooper Hewitt National Design Museum, 2 East 91st Street, (212)849-8300, through May 6. (Johnson)

'Vietnam: Destination for the New Millennium -- The Art of Dinh Q. LE' Born in Vietnam, Mr. Le moved to the United States at 11 and received a master of fine arts degree from the School of Visual Arts in New York. This small exhibition presents high-concept photographic and sculptural works about the Vietnam War and its effects, as well as a pair of sleek sculptures representing communications satellites that satirize Vietnam's plans to enter the space age and the global consumerist economy. Asia Society, 725 Park Avenue, at 70th Street, (212)288-6400, through Jan. 15. (Johnson)

Galleries: 57th Street

'Harry Kramer' The spirit of Abstract Expressionism lives on in the work of an artist who has been exhibiting in New York regularly since 1970. But Mr. Kramer's lusciously colored compositions of slashing gestures and planes of thick paint are more seductive than confrontational. Ameringer Yohe, 20 West 57th Street, (212)445-0051, through Nov. 5. (Johnson)

Galleries: Chelsea

'Contemporary Obscurists' Works by contemporary artists who use the camera obscura in variously inventive ways include Vera Lutter's huge negative image of an abandoned factory interior; Shi Guorui's ghostly, panoramic view of Shanghai; and Abelardo Morell's magical photographs of bedrooms with upside-down views of the city projected onto their interior walls. Alan Klotz, 511 West 25th Street, (212)741-4764, through Nov. 12. (Johnson)

Franklin Evans, 'freakout' If you like Mr. Evans's densely worked neo-psychedelic mural in the Drawing Center's current emerging artists show, you will appreciate the ink-and-watercolor drawings on view here. Crammed with richly colored geometric patterns, abstracted landscapes and figures, they are both trippy and intimately sensuous. Jeff Bailey, 511 West 25th Street, (212)989-0156, through Nov. 12. (Johnson)

YINKA SHONIBARE: 'MOBILITY' This British sculptor presents two spare installations using his signature post-colonialist symbol: the headless mannequin in 19th-century European clothes cut from African fabrics. James Cohan, 533 West 26th Street, (212)714-9500, through Oct. 29. (Johnson)

Sue Williams Few artists have combined figurative abstract painting and existential disgust as variously and effectively as Sue Williams has, and the trajectory continues in this show of new work. Here the battered body parts and de Kooning-esque swipes of the past have been distilled into a tumorous universe of genitals, anuses and noxious emissions, as the biological becomes political. 303 Gallery, 525 West 22nd Street, (212)255-1121, through Oct. 29. (Cotter)

Other Galleries

*Andre KertEsz From tiny, wonderfully intense pictures made in the teens in Budapest, where Kertesz was born in 1894, to formally acute views of Paris in the 20's and 30's, to emotionally and metaphorically resonant images of New York, where he lived from 1936 to his death in 1985, this beautiful exhibition covers the career of a giant of 20th-century photography. International Center of Photography, 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at 43rd Street, (212)857-0000, through Nov. 27. (Johnson)

'Landscape: Myth and Memory' Miniature ruins built of tiny bricks on rocky landscapes made of clay by Charles Simmonds; large, faux-antique photographs of Egyptian pyramids by Lynn Davis; an enormous, crusty book by Anselm Kiefer open to the photographic image of ancient architectural remains; and archetypal circles painted and photographed by Richard Long all add up to a nicely choreographed collective fantasy about primordial civilizations. Senior & Shopmaker, 21 East 26th Street, (212)213-6767, through Nov. 23. (Johnson)

LineAge: 'Selections Fall 2005' Among works by nine emerging artists in this entertaining show are poetic, notarized documents by CarianaCarianne, who claims to be two people in one body; intricately cutout linear abstractions by Adam Fowler; big drawings of human navels by Susan D'Amato; and a sculpture by Monika Grzymala, made by wrapping 4.4 miles of paper tape around three columns in the gallery. The Drawing Center, 35 Wooster Street, SoHo, (212)219-2166, through Oct. 29. (Johnson)

*MACCHINE NATURALI: 'ABSTRACT COLLAGES BY JOSEPH STELLA' The largest New York show in some time of Stella's elegant, understated collages, made from dirt-stained scraps of paper, can thoroughly rearrange your grasp of his sensibility and the history of American Modernism. Peter Freeman Inc., 560 Broadway, at Prince Street, SoHo (212)966-5154, through Oct. 29. (Smith)

*'NINE CONTEMPORARY SCULPTORS: FELLOWS OF THE SAINT-GAUDENS MEMORIAL' A lively link between past and present is the Fellowship of the Saint-Gaudens Memorial, a foundation set up in 1977 to honor the great 19th-century American sculptor Augustus Saint-Gaudens. Each year the foundation has chosen a contemporary American sculptor to receive a cash award ($10,000) and the opportunity for an eight-week summer show at the Saint-Gaudens estate in Cornish, N.H. This smartly selected exhibition presents representative work by nine award winners, ranging from a huge cube by Tara Donovan, made entirely of toothpicks (2003), to a mini-city sprawled on a vast tabletop, whose buildings of solid graphite were wrought by Alex McFarlane (1983). Saint-Gaudens's own work appears in it, too; surprisingly, it doesn't seem all that far out of context. UBS Art Gallery, 1285 Avenue of the Americas, at 51st Street, (212)713-2885, through Dec. 2. (Glueck)

*Evan Penny: 'No-One In Particular' This Toronto-based sculptor creates astoundingly realistic and, in some cases, weirdly distorted bigger-than-life busts of people out of silicone, rubber, hair and other materials. Sperone Westwater, 415 West 13th Street, West Village, (212)999-7337, through Oct. 29. (Johnson)

Last Chance

*Robert Bordo A beautiful, quietistic show by a painter whose work always manages to be both grounded and ethereal, soundless and resonant, abstract and not. Mr. Bordo is at midcareer. The time for a retrospective view is at hand. Alexander and Bonin, 132 10th Avenue, near 18th Street, Chelsea, (212)367-7474, closing tomorrow. (Cotter)

*Adam Dant: 'Standing under' An extraordinarily imaginative and skillful draftsman, Mr. Dant makes large pen-and-brush drawings of complex scenes populated by chunky little people, all viewed as if from below through a transparent ground or floor. Adam Baumgold, 74 East 79th Street, (212)861-7338, closing tomorrow. (Johnson)

Claire Fontaine Politically charged works by this French artist include a neon-light work that outlines the image of a hooded Iraqi prisoner and child; a neon sign in the gallery's front window that says in Arabic, ''Foreigners Everywhere''; and a tiny sculpture called ''In God We Trust'' in the form of a 25-cent coin with a fold-out box cutter secreted inside. Reena Spaulings, 371 Grand Street, SoHo, (212)477-5006, closing today. (Johnson)

* STUDIO MUSEUM IN HARLEM: 'SCRATCH: 2004-2005 ARTISTS IN RESIDENCE: WILLIAM CORDOVA, MICHAEL QUEENLAND AND MARC ANDRE ROBINSON' Rap, religion, Minimalism and Malcolm X all figure in this intricate, multilayered show of work by the three young residents, organized by the museum's associate curator, Christine Y. Kim. 144 West 125th Street, (212)864-4500, closing on Sunday. (Cotter)

'Tracking Suburbia' AND 'Do You Like Stuff?' From Jean-Frederic Schnyder's more-than-30-foot-long photograph of every building on the road between two Swiss towns in ''Tracking Suburbia'' to Frank Olive's countertop display of 100 items you could buy cheaply in a drugstore in ''Do You Like Stuff?,'' these two smart and wry group shows invite meditation on modern materialism. Swiss Institute, 495 Broadway, SoHo, (212)925-2035, closing tomorrow. (Johnson)

*WHITNEY MUSEUM: ROBERT SMITHSON Who knows whether Smithson is the most influential American postwar artist, as this show says. Consisting mostly of drawings, photographs and films (he didn't make many sculptures, not ones that could fit into a museum, anyway), this is the first full-scale overview of him in the country. It is consequently dry but still compelling testimony to a great exuberance cut drastically short when Smithson died at 35 in a plane crash in 1973. 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (212)570-3600, closing on Sunday. (Michael Kimmelman)

NEIL WELLIVER: 'A MEMORIAL EXHIBITION,' Five large paintings from the late 1970's and early 80's make an exhilarating tribute to this esteemed painter of Maine landscapes, who died last April at 75. Measuring up to 8 by 10 feet, the canvases depict dense woods, a rocky summit and marshland with beaver dams, and they are painted with generous, wide-brush strokes and a keen eye for natural light and texture. They are at once vividly realistic, expressively abstract and sensuously physical. Alexandre, 41 East 57th Street, (212)755-2828, closing tomorrow. (Johnson)

HENRY WOLF Organized by the photography critic Vince Aletti, this exhibition presents works by the suave art director, designer and photographer Henry Wolf (1925-2005). Examples of his designs for magazine covers and pictures by photographers that he commissioned are on view, but the most interesting part is the selection of Wolf's noncommercial photographs, which are compelling for their ultramodern ways with light, multiple spaces, speed and glamour. Howard Greenberg, 41 East 57th Street, (212)334-0010, closing tomorrow. (Johnson)

CORRECTION-DATE: October 24, 2005

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, a pop music listing in Weekend on Friday referred incorrectly to Danny Thompson, who is playing at Town Hall on Wednesday and Thursday with the songwriter and guitarist Richard Thompson. He is not Richard Thompson's son, and he plays bass, not guitar. (Richard's son Teddy, a guitarist, is not scheduled to perform.)

HEADLINE: Unesco Adopts New Plan Against Cultural Invasion

BYLINE: By ALAN RIDING

DATELINE: PARIS, Oct. 20 

 BODY:
Given the choice of defending Hollywood's interests or joining an international consensus, the United States stood almost alone at Unesco Thursday in opposing a new convention on cultural diversity designed to combat the homogenizing effect of cultural globalization.
 The convention, the result of two years' heated and occasionally bitter negotiations, was adopted at Unesco's Paris headquarters by 148 votes in favor, with the United States and Israel voting against and just four countries -- Australia, Nicaragua, Honduras and Liberia -- abstaining.
Even though the convention fell short of the hopes of its original sponsors, Canada and France, its adoption by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, or Unesco, was hailed as an important step toward protecting threatened cultures, particularly in developing countries. 
 However, the Bush administration argued that it could be interpreted as authorizing governments to undermine the rights of minorities and to control both culture and the free trade in ideas and information. Under the convention, governments will be permitted to use subsidies and quotas to promote their culture and, implicitly, to limit the access of Hollywood movies to their markets.
 Speaking after Thursday's vote, Louise Oliver, the United States ambassador to Unesco, said that the United States was the world's most culturally diverse country, but that it feared the convention ''could undermine, rather than promote, cultural diversity.'' She added, ''This instrument remains too flawed, too open to misinterpretation and too prone to abuse for us to support.''
 However, most of Washington's allies disagreed. Britain's ambassador to Unesco, Timothy Craddock, speaking for the European Union, said, ''This is a great day for Unesco.'' And, without mentioning the United States, he noted: ''With one country, we have agreed to disagree on this issue.''
 Earlier, France's culture minister, Renaud Donnedieu de Vabres, told reporters that at a time of growing religious fundamentalism, the convention underlined the importance of cultural diversity for artists and national pride as well as peace. ''It's a victory for consciousness-raising,'' he said.
 Unlike the United States delegation, which tried not to appear too identified with Hollywood's interests, Mr. Donnedieu de Vabres pointed to what he considered the current asymmetry of cultural power. ''Hollywood movies account for 85 percent of movie tickets sold around the world,'' he said. ''In the United States, only 1 percent of shown movies come from outside the United States.''
 Canada and France won broad support for the convention partly by blurring the question of its impact on trade liberalization or future trade talks. For instance, while the convention states that it cannot be interpreted as ''modifying rights and obligations of the parties under any other treaties to which they are parties,'' it also requires governments to take it into account in international negotiations.
 With major movie exporters like India insisting that the convention relates to culture, not trade, many experts believe its principal importance is symbolic. It has reached no unambiguous definition of cultural diversity and how it should be promoted and protected, but it has given voice to widespread concern about the perils of excessive domination by American popular culture.

HEADLINE: People Sound Pessimistic, But Are They? 

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS

 BODY:
THINGS may not be so bad in the American economy right now, but they are going to get a lot worse. 
 Who says? To look at recent surveys, you might think the question should be, who doesn't? Consumers, business leaders and fund managers all agree: the next move is down. Or, as Ronald Reagan would never have said, it's sunset in America.
But the remarkable thing is that such pessimism does not seem to be translating into action. People tell pollsters that they are worried, but few act as if they are. 
 Some allowance should be made because many of the surveys now coming out were conducted when concern over Hurricane Katrina was at its height, but weekly surveys show only very small improvements since then.
 Consider money managers. Merrill Lynch reported this week that its monthly poll of global money managers found that only 11 percent planned to own more American stocks in the next year than the normal amount they would own, compared with 63 percent who plan to own fewer American shares. That difference, of 52 percent, is the largest in the six years of the survey.
 ''Driving this sentiment,'' Merrill reported, ''is a poor outlook for corporate profits, a belief that equities are overvalued and the fact the U.S. is the only major region where monetary policy is being tightened.''
 The money managers are less negative on Britain and they are bullish on Japan, Continental Europe and emerging markets. 
 The people running corporations also profess concern. McKinsey, a management consulting firm, has been asking corporate executives about the economic outlook for the last 18 months and reports that American executives are less optimistic now than at any previous time in the survey, with a majority expecting things will get worse over the next six months. The American executives are more pessimistic than those in Europe or Asia.
 Then there are the consumers. They really don't think things are so bad now, but they see the dark clouds clearly. The Conference Board survey, asking about present conditions, finds a rating of 108.9, which is above average for the past quarter-century, even if it is down from this spring. But the rating for expectations over the next six months is just 71.7, about where it was after the Sept. 11 attacks.
 But investors might be better off to ignore forecasts and stick to facts. The Federal Reserve Board's beige book shows a far brighter picture from a different kind of poll -- one in which Fed economists ask companies how things are going. They find labor markets tightening and manufacturing activity increasing. 
 While money managers say they hate United States stocks, that hatred has not hurt much. The Standard & Poor's 500 is down about 2 percent since Hurricane Katrina hit, and is off almost 3 percent this year. 
 Some stocks are down, to be sure. An index of department store shares is off 9 percent since the hurricane, amid fears that higher gasoline and heating prices will force consumers to cut back just in time for Christmas. But that decline may be reversing with retail sales holding up better than expected.
 Given higher energy prices, it stands to reason that bad things are coming, but the reality is that few people have ever gone broke by betting that American consumers would keep spending, whether or not the experts thought they should. 
 Perhaps the best advice for investors pondering pessimistic polls came 36 years ago from John Mitchell, a Wall Street bond lawyer who had become Richard Nixon's attorney general. ''You will be better advised,'' he said, ''to watch what we do instead of what we say.''

HEADLINE: China's Economy Surges 9.4% in 3rd Quarter

BYLINE: By DAVID BARBOZA

DATELINE: BEIJING, Oct. 20 

 BODY:
China's roaring economy grew 9.4 percent in the third quarter of this year, fueled by surging exports, strong investments in infrastructure and solid retail sales, according to government figures released Thursday.
 The figures indicate that China's economy, the fastest-growing major economy in the world, shows no sign of moderating, despite repeated attempts by the government to ease growth as a way to head off inflation or overheating.
Economists and analysts who predicted late last year that China's growth would abate to about 8.5 percent in 2005 from about 9.5 percent in 2004 have repeatedly been forced to adjust their forecasts upward. 
 Thursday, more analysts raised their forecasts.
 ''This is much stronger growth than the market expected,'' said Hong Liang, an economist at Goldman Sachs, who expects the Chinese economy to grow 9.4 percent this year and 9 percent in 2006.
 The National Bureau of Statistics in Beijing said Thursday that China exported $564 billion worth of goods in the first three quarters of this year, 31 percent more than a year earlier.
 Fixed-asset investment spending rose 26 percent to about $700 billion. Retail spending on consumer goods reached about $563 billion in the first three quarters of the year, up 13 percent.
 Many experts say China seems to be locked into 9 percent economic growth -- even after its economy has advanced at a faster pace over the last 20 years than any other major country in modern history, even outpacing the earlier decadeslong expansions of Japan and South Korea. 
 ''It's not going to change,'' said Yiping Huang, an economist at Citigroup in Hong Kong. ''At the moment, the government is trying to slow momentum a bit, but we're not seeing slowing.''
 Many experts fear that China's economy has grown too dependent on foreign investment, government infrastructure spending and foreign trade. They say that China needs to encourage more domestic consumption as a buffer against a slowdown in consumption of Chinese goods in the rest of the world, particularly in the United States or Europe.
 There were some promising signs of that in Thursday's report. The government said that retail spending in China was strong last quarter, incomes rose steadily and yet inflation remained in check. There were also signs that more of the investment in China was being driven by government mandate rather than foreign investors -- making China a little less dependent on foreign investment and trade. 
 But many economists worry that an economy that has been sizzling hot for so long faces risks in coming years.
 Some economists suspect that China's growth may be understated. Although the government reported that gross domestic product rose 9.4 percent, down from 9.5 percent earlier in the year, Jonathan Anderson, the chief economist in Asia at UBS, said he believed that growth in China actually accelerated in the third quarter of this year.
 Despite government concerns about an overheated economy last year, some experts say the figures Thursday could be pleasing to China's leaders, and that there are fewer signs that would make those leaders clamp down.
 ''Will the government really hit the brakes? I doubt it,'' said Dong Tao, an economist at Credit Suisse First Boston. ''Much of the investment is following government instructions. It's in second- and third-tier cities. This is what the government wants. They've regained solid control over inflation.''

HEADLINE: Signs of Inflation Increase, And Share Prices Tumble 

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
Stocks sold off sharply yesterday, pushing the three major gauges down more than 1 percent, after a major inflation gauge hit a 25-year high and stirred fears of higher interest rates, while Pfizer posted disappointing quarterly results.
 The stock market dropped around midday after a report from the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia showed a crucial regional inflation measure rose to its highest level since November 1980.
''It clearly rang the inflation bell,'' said Jay Indovino, head of trading at Sungard Institutional Brokerage Inc. 
 Selling pressure mounted late in the day after the benchmark indexes broke crucial technical levels. 
 The Dow Jones industrial average fell 133.03 points, or 1.3 percent, to 10,281.10. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index sank 17.96 points, or 1.5 percent, to 1,177.80. The Nasdaq composite index dropped 23.13 points, or 1.1 percent, to 2,068.11.
 After the closing bell, shares of the Web search leader Google climbed after the company reported a sharp rise in quarterly profit. Google surged almost 11 percent, to $336.30 a share, from the close of $303.20.
 ''The results were better than expected,'' said Rick Summer, equity analyst at Morningstar in Chicago. ''Google is still top of mind for folks doing Web searches, and that shows up in these results.'' 
 During the regular session, traders said the S.&P. 500 broke below a crucial technical point, the 200-day moving average at 1,199.50, which represented a psychological level for investors. 
 ''Everything's off, and I think Pfizer is weighing down on it,'' said Stephen Carl, principal and head of United States equity trading at the Williams Capital Group.
 Shares of Pfizer, a Dow component, registered their biggest single-day percentage slide in 10 months to an eight-year low and exerted the biggest drag on the Dow average. Pfizer said third-quarter profit slid by 52 percent and it withdrew its financial outlook through 2007. The shares fell 8.6 percent, or $2.07, to $21.90, on the New York Stock Exchange.
 Health and personal care stocks represented the sector that contributed the most to the Dow's steep drop, with the energy sector coming in a close second. The American Stock Exchange pharmaceutical index fell 2.9 percent.
 Among declining health-related stocks, the Dow component Johnson & Johnson slipped 15 cents, to $64.17.
 In the bond market, the 10-year Treasury note gained 7/32, to a price of 98 18/32. The note's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, fell to 4.43 percent from 4.46 percent on Wednesday.

HEADLINE: Number of Jobs Lost to Storms Totals 478,000

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
About 40,000 Americans filed claims for unemployment benefits last week as a result of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, pushing the total who have lost jobs because of the storms to 478,000. 
 The Labor Department reported yesterday that the 40,000 weekly increase in hurricane-related applications for benefits was down from a rise of 75,000 such claims two weeks ago, evidence that the wave of joblessness caused by the Gulf Coast devastation might be cresting. 
 ''The impact of the hurricanes is now clearly diminishing,'' said Ian Shepherdson, chief United States economist for High Frequency Economics, a private forecasting firm in Valhalla, N.Y. 
 Other data released yesterday showed that a leading gauge of future economic activity fell for a third consecutive month in September, reflecting the surge in energy costs caused by hurricane-related shutdowns of refineries and oil platforms along the Gulf Coast. 
 The Conference Board reported that its index of leading economic indicators fell 0.7 percent after declines of 0.1 percent in both August and July. Five of the 10 components that make up the index showed weakness in September. 
 Three consecutive declines in the leading index can be a signal of a significant slowdown in economic growth in coming months. 
 The Labor Department's weekly survey of claims for unemployment benefits showed that the total number of Americans receiving such benefits totaled 2.89 million for the week ended Oct. 8. That was the highest number of people receiving benefits in more than a year. 
 The 40,000 increase in hurricane-related claims was part of a total of 355,000 new claims for unemployment benefits last week. That was the lowest overall level since the week ended Sept. 17, the first week hurricane claims began showing up.

HEADLINE: Consumer Demand at Home Keeps China's Factories Humming, and Hiring

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER

DATELINE: GUANGZHOU, China, Oct. 16 

 BODY:
Until this summer, the Kaierlai Sports Goods Company in Shishi, China, depended heavily on exports of its windbreakers to Germany.
 But when the European Union reimposed import quotas and abruptly halted the shipments this summer, Kaierlai did not miss a beat. It stepped up sales of windbreakers within China so quickly that not only did it not lay off any of its 1,000 workers this autumn, it will hire another 1,000 when a second factory opens next year.
''We are selling to the local market instead,'' said Cai Hui-zhao, the company's sales manager. ''Buying power is stronger than before, and people have more money to spend on clothes.'' 
 Kaierlai's success underlines a growing force in China's economy: consumers. During his weekend visit to Beijing, Treasury Secretary John W. Snow shifted the Bush administration's emphasis away from demanding that China let its currency appreciate and toward asking China to encourage consumer spending -- including buying goods from the United States.
 But the new American stance may be a case of pushing on an open door: consumer spending in China is already surging with considerable government help and approval.
 After a quarter-century of growth powered largely by exports, China is showing signs of opening a new chapter of strong growth, this time propelled by domestic spending. If China can make a smooth transition from export-led growth to consumer-driven growth, it will have managed a feat that has eluded many of Asia's earlier rising powers.
 Japan, South Korea and Thailand, in particular, all suffered serious economic reversals in the 1990's after achieving remarkable gains through exports. But all three are now showing greater prosperity because of rising domestic demand, providing lessons that China may be able to draw on to avoid a long recession first.
 A year and a half after the Chinese government imposed strict bank lending controls and other measures to cool an overheating economy, the authorities in Beijing have begun easing up in other areas and are starting to let the good times roll. They have cut taxes for farmers and hinted at broader tax cuts, except for fuel, which could further stimulate the economy.
 ''Recent data suggest that domestic demand in China is on the mend,'' wrote Liang Hong, a Goldman Sachs analyst, in a recent research report, ''supported by a quiet easing of monetary policy and other more domestic-demand-friendly policy changes.''
 Retail sales rose at a robust pace of 12.7 percent in September after August's 12.5 percent. And M2, a broad measure of the money supply, grew 17.9 percent in September and has been accelerating since spring. 
 At the same time, wages and benefits are finally rising for many industrial workers after a decade of stagnation. 
 A sharp rise in food prices in 2003 and early 2004 made being a farmer much more attractive and being a city dweller more costly, braking somewhat the migration to cities from farms. Factories, often pushed by regulators, began paying higher wages and offering more benefits.
 In interviews at the semiannual Canton Trade Fair here with executives from a range of industries, a picture emerged of a Chinese economy increasingly poised for further growth in spending.
 Provincial governments like Guangdong's are requiring more companies to offer at least the simplest medical care for workers and to make some contributions to provincial retirement plans. 
 A high level of household savings -- nearly half of household income for urban residents -- has curtailed consumer spending. To the extent that benefits are provided, they reduce insecurity for workers and also the need for very large savings to prepare for retirement or a possible injury, freeing up money to spend.
 ''Everywhere in China, the benefits costs are increasing,'' said Bruce Shui, a sales representative here for the Shanghai Dafa Electrical Equipment Company, which has raised the price of its waffle irons 3 percent this year, partly to cover the extra cost of benefits.
 Factories are sometimes resorting to surprising measures to lure workers, in another sign that Chinese workers, who are also consumers, have real bargaining power these days. Here in Southeastern China, companies like Zhong Ling Garment in Dongguan are even installing air-conditioning -- an amenity not found in some older factories in the southern United States.
 The installation and the additional electricity have raised by 5 percent the cost of the women's panties sewn in the factory, said Ann Ho, Zhong Ling's chief sales manager. Yet despite being largely closed out of the United States market this year because of a trade dispute that has severely limited Chinese exports of women's underwear, the company felt compelled to provide a cooler factory.
 ''It was very hot. The workers were saying, 'I can't work because it's so hot,''' Ms. Ho said. ''We are using a lot of electricity now that we have had to install air-conditioning.''
 Companies are able to afford things like air-conditioning for workers partly because banks in China appear to be fairly active in lending this year, with loans up 13.5 percent last month compared with a year earlier.
 ''If you've got assets, it's easy to get a loan,'' said Zhao Jian-qian, the vice general manager of the Zhongshan Wanlitong Antenna Equipment Company, which manufactures television antennas in Zhongshan, a sprawling new city on the southeastern edge of Guangzhou.
 Some experts suggest that consumer spending has already been stronger than official statistics reveal and that household savings and exports have been weaker. 
 Jonathan Anderson, a UBS economist in Hong Kong, said exports were overstated because to a considerable extent they involved little more than the snapping together of parts made elsewhere. Rising household savings, he said, mainly reflect a steep increase in Chinese housing prices in recent years. Exclude housing, and net household financial assets have not risen at all as a share of economic output since 1998, he calculated in a research report.
 Despite the strength in consumer spending, several obstacles remain to continued growth, economists said. Household borrowing has been gradually increasing and may yet reach levels at which Chinese families become wary of further debt. A slump in housing prices -- developers in Shanghai have begun offering a variety of promotions to sell apartments that once sold in hours -- could quickly depress spending.
 Chinese officials have disclosed this year a growing number of protests in rural areas and some in cities, raising the persistent question of whether China is as politically stable as it appears on the surface.
 Rising costs at home and possible protectionism overseas may also undermine China's competitiveness abroad, and that may affect consumer attitudes.
 Dave Kwon, a sales manager of the Qingdao Minplus Plastics Company in east central China, said prices had risen steeply for the raw plastic used in the bright orange-and-blue tarpaulins and dropcloths his company makes for painters. That makes it hard for Qingdao Minplus to cover labor costs and other expenses that are higher in China than in some of its even poorer neighbors.
 That could force the tarpaulin industry -- and perhaps others -- to move overseas someday. ''Now it's in China; maybe next it's in India or Vietnam,'' Mr. Kwon said.
 But for now, many consumers in China and the companies that market to them appear confident and willing to spend.
 Standing next to rows of bright yellow, red, blue and pink windbreakers at the fair, Mr. Cai of Kaierlai hailed the sprawling size of his company's next factory and was almost cavalier about its former market.
 ''From time to time, there are some German clients who come by, and the first question they ask is, 'Do you have any quotas?''' Mr. Cai said.
 He said Kaierlai had no quotas for Germany, but it would have no trouble selling its windbreakers anyway.

 BODY:
State Comptroller Alan G. Hevesi, left, who has often criticized the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, said yesterday that he supported its plan to give subway, bus and commuter-rail riders fare discounts or free tickets during the holiday season at an estimated cost of $50 million. Mr. 
Hevesi said the plan would help the economy and the environment and ease traffic congestion. Although the money would come from a one-time surplus that could be as much as $928 million, some critics have called the discounts fiscally irresponsible. Sewell Chan (NYT)

HEADLINE: A Solemn Memorial or a Place to Shop? For 9/11 Site, Both

BYLINE: By DAVID W. DUNLAP

 BODY:
In an unplanned but telling coincidence, state officials laid out two visions yesterday for the future of ground zero: A solemn memorial that deserves worldwide gifts in the hundreds of millions of dollars. And an attractive place to shop.
 There has probably never been a plainer expression of the dual identity of the World Trade Center site, which is to function simultaneously as an indelible marker of the horror of Sept. 11, 2001, and as an economic engine to revive the commercial and retail bustle once generated for Lower Manhattan by the twin towers.
In a midafternoon meeting just north of Union Square, the board of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey authorized planning and preliminary design work for about 200,000 square feet of retail space -- roughly half the area of the old trade center shopping concourse -- to be built within the new PATH terminal and transportation hub. 
 At almost the same moment, on Wall Street, the nine-month-old World Trade Center Memorial Foundation announced that it had raised $101,031,734 from private sources, 20 percent of its ultimate goal of $500 million, which the foundation chairman, John C. Whitehead, said was a ''formidable'' challenge.
 That is particularly true as construction costs rise, since there is already plenty of work for contractors and a great demand for steel, concrete and other materials. That will only increase with the rebuilding of the Gulf Coast in the wake of Hurricane Katrina.
 Nonetheless, seeking to dispel the impression that the controversy over Gov. George E. Pataki's decision to evict the International Freedom Center and the Drawing Center from the site had dampened donors' enthusiasm, the memorial foundation organized a ceremony for the governor to sign a bill allowing New Yorkers to contribute to the foundation through an income tax check-off.
 ''We will generate tens of millions of dollars from people across the state who understand the importance of never forgetting,'' the governor said.
 Among the largest contributors identified publicly by the foundation yesterday were:
 The Starr Foundation, which gave $25 million before the recent controversy. Its chairman, Maurice R. Greenberg, is a foundation board member.
 Deutsche Bank, whose $15 million contribution was also made before the controversy erupted this summer. Josef Ackerman, the chairman of the bank's group executive committee, is on the foundation board.
 The Bank of New York, which gave $10 million last week. Its chairman and chief executive, Thomas A. Renyi, also sits on the foundation board and was the host of yesterday's board meeting and news conference at the bank headquarters.
 Smaller gifts included pledges from all 20 members of the foundation staff, totaling $55,000, said its president and chief executive, Gretchen Dykstra.
 Having passed the $100 million mark, Mr. Whitehead said, the memorial foundation is now eligible to receive the first $100 million of a pledge from the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation, of which he is also chairman.
 The foundation is to construct and own the memorial proper, centered on two pool-filled voids where the twin towers stood; an underground memorial museum threaded through the original trade center foundations and structural remnants; and an above-ground 9/11 museum that was until recently to have housed the Freedom Center and the Drawing Center. It will also build a performing arts center.
 Just how much the memorial and memorial museums will cost has yet to be set, but it will certainly be far higher than the $350 million estimate from last year. (The underground vehicle screening center planned for the site will cost $537 million alone.)
 For one thing, the above-ground museum has now been folded into the memorial project. For another, generally rising construction costs include a 10 percent ''bump up'' as a result of Katrina, said Thomas H. Roger, a construction executive and board member. A number of organizations allied as the take-back-the-memorial coalition had urged Americans not to contribute to the project as long as the Freedom Center and the Drawing Center were to be housed on the same block as the memorial.
 Yesterday, a coalition member, Tim Sumner, said in an e-mail message, ''While no one wants to support the W.T.C. Memorial Foundation's fund-raising more than we do, we are waiting for a clearer idea of content and programming for above and below ground sections of the museum.''
 At the Port Authority meeting, $1.95 million was approved by the board for planning the retail space in the PATH terminal being designed by Santiago Calatrava. The agency also released renderings of how the stores there might look when they open in 2010.
 ''It demonstrates how sensitive we're going to be with the memorial,'' said Kenneth J. Ringler Jr., the executive director of the authority. ''Santiago has designed it very carefully so you don't lose any of the beauty or the significance of the architecture.''
 Mr. Ringler added that there would be no retail space within the memorial quadrant.

HEADLINE: After 60 Years, the Yanks Fly Out, Leaving Just the Ghosts

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER

DATELINE: RHEIN-MAIN AIR BASE, Germany, Oct. 17 

 BODY:
A chilly autumn breeze blows through the deserted passenger terminal here, as American soldiers haul desks, chairs, cabinets, benches -- anything that is not bolted down -- out of the building. At the Crow's Nest, where off-duty Air Force pilots used to gather for a drink, empty beer bottles line the ghostly bar.
 Long known as the American military's ''Gateway to Europe,'' the Rhein-Main Air Base is shutting down, the victim of both changing economic and geopolitical realities. The last planes flew out of here a couple of weeks ago, and a skeleton crew is packing up the 383-acre complex before turning it over to the Germans at the end of December. 
Rhein-Main is not the only prominent American institution with moving vans parked out front. Last week, the United States Consulate left central Frankfurt for a heavily fortified complex on the outskirts of town. And the consulate's cultural center, Amerika Haus, moved its staff out of a landmark downtown building to join the consulate in its suburban redoubt. 
 It adds up to a palpable lowering of the American profile in Frankfurt, a city that since World War II has been known, and occasionally derided by Germans, for being the most American in Germany.
 While Rhein-Main's operations are being transferred to other American bases in Germany, its closing after 60 years is particularly symbolic. From its role as a staging ground for the Berlin airlift shortly after the war to its recent use as a transit hub for troops bound for Iraq and Afghanistan, the base has been one of the most visible manifestations of American power in Germany.
 ''This isn't a normal base closing because there's so much history,'' said Col. Bradley Denison, the last base commander. ''There's a feeling of sadness that we have to say farewell to our German friends.''
 For all the talk of friendship, the closing of Rhein-Main and the other changes come as Germany and the United States are still trying to thaw out a relationship chilled by their rift over the Iraq war.
 To some Americans who are longtime residents here, the recent moves are a melancholy reminder of how much things have changed since the height of the cold war, when Germany and the United States linked arms against a common enemy on the other side of the Berlin Wall.
 These days, the Pentagon is pulling its troops out of Germany and redeploying them for future wars elsewhere -- wars that Germans cannot be automatically counted on to support. Meanwhile, American diplomats, driven by post-9/11 security concerns, are erecting ever-higher walls. Amerika Haus is a case in point. Founded after the war as a pocket-size American library, the center -- and others like it throughout Germany -- was once the first introduction for Germans to American ideas and culture. While the consulate still holds a lease on the building and continues to stage events there, the American staff is gone and its future is uncertain.
 ''They're supposed to be practicing public diplomacy,'' said Dennis Phillips, an American who met his German wife while stationed in Bremerhaven in 1968 and came back 14 years ago to work in a bank.
 ''If they retreat behind gates and high walls, that's not public diplomacy,'' he said. ''It may be diplomacy, but it's not public diplomacy.''
 The consulate said its move was dictated by space, as well as security. With the largest consulate staff in the world, it was bursting at the seams. The new building, a converted hospital, is big and sits well back from the street, making it more secure than the old one, nestled as it was in an elegant neighborhood.
 Moving American diplomats out of Amerika Haus will allow the building to relax its tight security measures, which had made it a less welcoming place for the German public. ''You couldn't really accept people off the street anymore,'' said Scott Rauland, the public affairs officer.
 Germans are generally dry-eyed about the decline in American visibility. While the locals accepted soldiers as part of the landscape, they led a very separate existence, with their own housing, schools and shops.
 ''You see fewer soldiers in the streets, but the fact that American facilities are leaving opens new possibilities for development in Frankfurt,'' said Uwe Paulsen, a member of the city parliament.
 Last year, 624,000 American soldiers and their families passed through Rhein-Main. Many were troops coming from or going to Iraq. Chancellor Gerhard Schroder and most Germans staunchly opposed the war there.
 While the closing of Rhein-Main comes at a time when the Pentagon is scaling back troops in Germany, the agreement to hand over the base predates that redeployment. Frankfurt Airport, which shares runways and taxiways with the base, has been pushing for years to take over the property.
 The airport -- Europe's second busiest after Heathrow in London -- plans to bulldoze the site and construct a third passenger terminal. ''This is more economic than political,'' Colonel Denison said, ''They needed to expand, and we were the only place they could go.''
 The airport and the German government agreed to pay nearly $300 million to upgrade two other American bases, Ramstein and Spangdahlem, to take over the airlift operations handled by Rhein-Main.
 Colonel Denison, who also is married to a German, said he felt no ill will from the local people. ''Some Germans may not have supported our war, but they supported us in other ways,'' he said.
 Frankfurters, too, seem eager to turn the page. Mr. Schroder's departure as chancellor, they say, will clear the air, since his successor, Angela Merkel, is likely to seek closer ties to Washington.
 ''German-American relations are moving into a new phase,'' Mr. Paulsen said. ''The cold war is over and there have been obvious differences between us. But that will change again with the new government.''

HEADLINE: Entente Not So Cordiale 

BYLINE: By Geoffrey Wheatcroft. 
Geoffrey Wheatcroft is the author of ''Le Tour: A History of the Tour de France'' and, most recently, ''The Strange Death of Tory England.''

DATELINE: Monticello, Corsica 

 BODY:
HOW to celebrate a victory among the vanquished? Today is an heroic date in my country's history, the 200th anniversary of the Battle of Trafalgar, when the Royal Navy destroyed the French and Spanish fleets off Spain, and then, in the moment of supreme victory, Horatio Nelson fell mortally wounded, the greatest of English admirals dying at the greatest of English victories.
 But I am not in England. I am in France, where Trafalgar Day most decidedly is not being celebrated, and where, as I have learned, it is still a sore subject.
Not that this is surprising. Any current animosity between France and the United States is nothing compared with the ancient fraught relationship between France and England, from the Hundred Years' War to Napoleon. 
 Even now, French politicians wince when they reach London by way of Waterloo station and look up Whitehall on their way to Downing Street toward Trafalgar Square, with Lord Nelson atop his vast column.
 Last year was the centenary of the Entente Cordiale, the somewhat decorative agreement of 1904 between London and Paris, but the time since has not seen the most cordial of Anglo-French relations. Iraq has driven a wedge between the two countries, and President Jacques Chirac quite lost his temper with Prime Minister Tony Blair when Mr. Blair last raised the question of farm subsidies.
 Anyone can learn about these difficulties on a personal level. When I say I am in France, I am to be exact in northwestern Corsica: Monticello is a hill village overlooking the sea not far from Calvi, where my family and I come on holidays. 
 We have many friends in this place, and in the Pasturella, Jo-Jo Martini's hotel-cafe here, there's a bantering spirit you could almost call egalite and fraternite. On Sunday night we all grumbled as Ajaccio was unjustly beaten by Lyon, though at least Ajaccio is still in the French first division, unlike the other Corsican soccer club, Bastia, which was demoted last season.
 Even these names all echo distant Anglo-French rivalry. Ajaccio is the birthplace of Napoleon Bonaparte (as you are rather often reminded there), Bastia was taken in the siege of 1794 by Nelson himself, shortly before he lost his eye in the attack on Calvi. As every schoolboy -- rather than lyceen -- ought to know, this was the eye to which, at the later Battle of Copenhagen, in 1801, Nelson held his telescope so that he could not read an inconvenient signal. 
 He himself is far from hated on this island -- ''un bon mec,'' one of my friends in the cafe says, a good guy -- but that's because of local history. In that 1794 operation, the British were supporting the Corsican patriots led by Pasquale Paoli, whose luster still reflects on Nelson among a later generation of Corsicans who'd like to break away from France.
 But Trafalgar is another matter. When I gently or jocosely raise the subject, the reaction is either unprintable, or the conversation is switched darkly into the local patois, or, from one acquaintance, there comes a sarcastic allusion to the ''great English naval victories'' from Trafalgar to Mers el-Kebir in the summer of 1940, when Winston Churchill, with supreme ruthlessness, ordered the Royal Navy to sink the fleet of the French, his allies only weeks earlier. All in all, I doubt whether we shall be bandying historical reminiscences at the cafe today.
 Although all of that might have a ring of English arrogance, there is another side to it. Plenty of Englishmen over the years have suffered from what the Bloomsbury gang called French flu, an infection of morbid Francophilia, a feeling that they ordered these things artistically and intellectually better in France. But today it is France that is passing through a crisis of confidence, culturally as well as politically. Rather than Bloomsberries with French flu you are now more likely to find French people admiring the vibrancy of English-language literary culture.
 There is something almost touching about Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin's hero-worship of Napoleon, but plenty of Frenchmen find it absurd. And while Mr. Chirac still insists on the superior virtue of the French ''social model'' of high taxes and all-embracing welfare, an answer comes from Nicolas Sarkozy, the capable and remarkably ambitious politician who was Mr. Chirac's protege and is now his rival: the so-called social model is scarcely social if it means more than 10 percent unemployment, and it isn't a model at all since no one else wants to emulate it.
 As to sports, for all that Lille held Manchester United to a tedious goalless tie on Tuesday, few people think that a French team will win the European club competition, while even fewer that les Bleus will repeat their great victory in the 1998 soccer World Cup. And although Lance Armstrong has departed, with some nasty kicks as he went, no one thinks that a French rider will win the Tour de France in the foreseeable future.
 Plenty of Mr. Blair's own compatriots think that he was wrong and Mr. Chirac was right about Iraq, and yet Mr. Blair has clearly outmaneuvered the Frenchman in their latest jousts. 
 Sometimes, indeed, and for his vaunted attachment to the ''European idea,'' Mr. Blair seems to echo Nelson's great contemporary the Duke of Wellington, who said (in a line I donate to the Bush White House), ''We are, we always have been, and I trust we always shall be, detested in France.''
 Not my own view; and yet I know from experience that this on-and-off friendship will always be awkward, not least because of long memories. Why, in 10 years it will be time to celebrate the 200th anniversary of Waterloo, as well as the 600th of the British victory at Agincourt. And by ''we,'' helas, mes amis, I'm afraid I don't mean nous.

HEADLINE: New and Flashy, Big and Glassy

BYLINE: By PATRICK McGEEHAN

 BODY:
New York City officials started dreaming of a classy ferry terminal on the Hudson River in Midtown sometime in 1999. Six years, $56 million and one financial crisis later, they are preparing to open it to the public on Monday.
 The terminal, a two-story glass structure on a pier at the west end of 39th Street, is the latest manifestation of the prevailing view that if government agencies build the docks, the ferry operators and ferry riders will follow. Known as the West Midtown Ferry Terminal, it will be available to any company that wants to pick up or drop off commuters there. 
 But for now, the operators of the New York Waterway ferry service will have it all to themselves. Their company, controlled by the family of Arthur E. Imperatore Sr., is leasing the building from the city for 10 years. It will also be running it for the city as a public terminal, like those at airports, with hopes of attracting more commuters and boat operators. 
 New York Waterway, which was on the verge of bankruptcy less than a year ago and had to sell half of its assets, is to pay $12,500 a month in rent. The company has also agreed to share with the city any revenue from concessions and advertising, as well as fees collected from other ferry services that want to bring boats there.
 Officials of the New York City Economic Development Corporation, which built the terminal, said they expected to receive $200,000 to $300,000 from New York Waterway in the first year.
 The deal will enable the company to move its commuter operations and New York offices into the terminal from the makeshift setup it has maintained a block south for almost 20 years. The new terminal has room for indoor ticket counters, a spacious waiting room and even a cafe with an angled, elevated deck that the architects called ''the diving board.''
 The terminal, which wraps around two unsightly ventilation towers that pump air into the Lincoln Tunnel below, was designed by William Nicholas Boudova & Associates. The firm is responsible for several other transportation facilities in the city, including Terminal 1 at Kennedy International Airport.
 With seven boat slips and 30,000 square feet of space inside, the terminal could handle as many as 20,000 passengers an hour, said Sandra Tomas, who oversaw the project for the city. That is far more capacity than the current contingent of commuters requires: Only about 5,000 people ride ferries to and from New York Waterway's adjacent dock each weekday.
 Plans for the terminal, which date back to 1999, gained momentum after 9/11 when ferries carried tens of thousands of people fleeing Manhattan. For about a year after the terrorist attack, New York Waterway operated additional ferries from a temporary barge that was moored where the new terminal now stands.
 ''God forbid there's another disaster in New York, but this terminal serves an important function in an emergency,'' said Arthur Imperatore Jr., whose father started the ferry service in 1986.
 The Federal Emergency Management Agency provided money that paid for dredging, so the terminal could handle the parking of ferries of various sizes. Of the $56 million total, $38.4 million came from federal agencies, $12.3 million from the city, $3.3 million from the state and $2 million from New York Waterway.
 The ferry company made its contribution two years ago, before it ran into significant financial trouble. During that episode, the Imperatores struck a deal to sell half their boats and routes to a new enterprise controlled by William B. Wachtel, a lawyer in Manhattan.
 Having survived that crisis, Mr. Imperatore smiled as he walked about in his company's new New York quarters yesterday. 
 The lesson for the day, Mr. Imperatore said, was, ''If you live long enough, good things will happen to you.''

Ford Plans Plant Closings in Restructuring After Reporting a Quarterly Loss of $284 Million
The Ford Motor Company will announce a restructuring of its American operations in January that will include plant closings and job cuts, the company's chief executive, William Clay Ford Jr., said. His statement came as his company reported a $284 million loss in the third quarter, its first quarterly loss since the final three months of 2003. The company said it lost $1.49 billion, before taxes, in its North American automotive operations. [Page C1.]

The United Auto Workers announced the details of its tentative agreement with General Motors and said that for the first time, G.M.'s union retirees will have to pay deductibles, monthly premiums and co-payments. [C3.]

Google Tops Expectations with Third-Quarter Profit
Finding more ways to make money from its spot as the world's most popular Internet search engine, Google topped Wall Street expectations and its own forecast and posted sharply higher profit in the third quarter. [C1.]

Congress Passes Lawsuit Shield Law for Gun Industry
Congress delivered a long-sought victory to the gun industry when the House voted to shield firearms manufacturers and dealers from liability lawsuits. The bill now goes to President Bush, who has promised to sign it. [A1.]

Medical Publication Questions a Diabetes Drug
An article in the Journal of the American Medical Association said the proposed diabetes pill Pargluva seems to significantly increase risks of heart attacks and strokes, and an accompanying editorial said the drug's sponsors, Bristol-Myers Squibb and Merck, had submitted misleading data to the Food and Drug Administration that ''may have fostered an illusion of safety.'' [C7.]

Roche has agreed to meet with four generic drug companies to discuss allowing them to manufacture the anti-influenza drug Tamiflu, which is in short supply as countries stockpile it to prepare for a possible flu pandemic. [C7.]

Facing increasing generic competition and concerns about the heart risks of Celebrex, its once-popular painkiller, Pfizer said its third-quarter profit fell 50 percent, to $1.6 billion, and its sales fell 5 percent from the year earlier period. Profit for the current quarter will fall far short of analysts' forecasts, the company said and its shares fell 8 percent. [C7.]

Advertising Executive Resigns Over Remarks
Neil French, a well-known advertising executive and worldwide creative consultant at WPP Group, the world's second-largest agency holding company, resigned his position amid an uproar over remarks he made at an industry event about female creative executives. [C1.]

SBC's Profit Falls on Costs of Hurricane and a Merger
SBC Communications said its profit slipped 41 percent in the third quarter partly because its wireless unit, Cingular, had higher costs related to hurricanes and its merger with AT&T Wireless. [C3.]

Senate Panel Approves Digital Television Measure
A Senate panel approved legislation to complete the slow migration from analog to digital television by 2009, a transition of enormous importance to the television, cable and wireless telephone industries. [C3.]

Nigeria Reaches Deal to Pay Debts at a Discount
Nigeria reached an agreement with the Paris Club of creditors to pay off $30 billion of debt for $12 billion, a significant breakthrough for a nation long deemed too wealthy with oil money and too corrupt to be granted relief from debt accumulated over years of misrule. [A14.]

Chinese Economy Grew 9.4 Percent in Third Quarter
China's roaring economy grew 9.4 percent in the third quarter of this year, fueled by surging exports, strong investments in infrastructure and solid retail sales, according to a government report. [C4.]

China's rapid economic growth has fostered a tourist boom among the mainland Chinese, with Southeast Asia the favorite destination, at least for now. And, like travelers for centuries before them, they are developing a reputation, which some say is loud and obnoxious. [C1.]

After a quarter-century of growth powered largely by exports, China is showing signs of opening a new chapter of strong growth, this time propelled by domestic spending. [C4.]

Europe Fails Again to Reach Deal for Lower Farm Tariffs
The European Union failed again to deliver new cuts in its farm tariffs and subsidies, held back by France's refusal to allow deeper reductions, while other trading nations laid pressure on Europe to act. Brazil's foreign minister, Celso Amorim, left, who has become a spokesman for developing nations in these talks, urged Europe to break the logjam. [C13.]

Stocks Fall Sharply on Report of High Inflation
Stocks sold off sharply, pushing the three major gauges down more than 1 percent, after a major inflation gauge hit a 25-year high and stirred fears of higher interest rates, while Pfizer posted disappointing quarterly results. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 133.03 points, to 10,281.10. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index sank 17.96 points, to 1,177.80. The Nasdaq composite index dropped 23.13 points, to 2,068.11.

HEADLINE: Welcoming Their Yuan But Not Their Manners 

BYLINE: By WAYNE ARNOLD

DATELINE: SINGAPORE, Oct. 20 

 BODY:
There was near-pandemonium at the L'Oreal cosmetics counter. With only hours before the end of their weeklong National Day holiday earlier this month, a busload of package tourists from China descended on a local department store here and began clamoring for all the skin refiner and ''wrinkle de-crease'' they could buy.
 Karen Eu, one of three clerks attending to them and herself of Chinese ancestry, opened her eyes wide in exasperation. ''Oh, my God,'' she said as she carried another fistful of Chinese yuan to the cash register. ''They talk so loud I have to yell until my throat hurts.''
China's rapid economic growth has fostered a tourist boom among the mainland Chinese, with Southeast Asia the favorite destination, at least for now. The surge in package tour groups from China, an important source of income for the region, is also giving rise to an unflattering stereotype: the loud, rude and culturally naive Chinese tourist. 
 Sound familiar? The tide of travelers from China mirrors the emergence of virtually every group of overseas tourists since the Romans, from Britons behaving badly in the Victorian era and ugly Americans in postwar Europe to the snapshot-happy Japanese of the 1980's.
 So it is not much of a surprise that tourists from mainland China, often going abroad for the first time, are leaving similar complaints in their wake.
 But China is also manufacturing its own twist on the age-old tale, as became apparent in July when a group of more than 300 from China took umbrage at illustrations of a pig's face on their check-in vouchers at a casino resort in predominantly Muslim Malaysia. 
 Although the resort said the drawings were meant only to distinguish their Chinese guests from Muslims, who cannot eat pork (or gamble), the Chinese demonstrated their pique by staging a sit-in in the hotel lobby and belting out their national anthem. It took 40 police officers with dogs to clear them out. 
 Earlier that month, a group of mainland tourists staged a similar protest on a flight to Hong Kong from Bangkok after a departure delay kept them from making a day trip in Singapore.
 So far, only an estimated 2 percent of China's population ventures abroad each year, according to a recent report on China tourism by CLSA Emerging Markets in Hong Kong. But the World Tourism Organization predicts that China will become the world's fourth-largest source of overseas tourists by 2020.
 Groups from China began traveling to Europe last year. And if the United States agrees to grant visas to China's tourists, analysts say it will undoubtedly be a top draw.
 Clean and safe, Singapore, with its large Mandarin-speaking population, attracts more Chinese tourists than any of its Southeast Asian neighbors. Some China visitors are newly rich from big cities like Beijing and Shanghai, and stay in five-star hotels. Benefiting from rising incomes and more direct air connections, however, an increasing majority comes from the new middle class in China's provincial capitals. 
 The typical visit to Singapore is just three days. The average income is still below $2,000 a year, and most tourists from China sign up for $250 package tours that whisk them through as many as five countries in a week.
 Many of these tours are what the industry calls zero-dollar tours, providing no profit margin. Instead, the agents make their money by diverting their groups to jewelers or restaurants that give them a commission on sales.
 ''We have to admit it was a problem for many years,'' said Juthamas Siriwan, governor of the Tourism Authority of Thailand, where zero-dollar tours have hurt the country's image in China. The Thai government is trying to crack down on zero-dollar tours.
 While some analysts say China's tourists have dubious benefits to regional tourism, others argue that they have a broader economic impact. Unlike Westerners or Japanese who splurge on expensive resorts and spend their entire vacation sunbathing, they say, the Chinese devote a greater proportion of their holiday time to sightseeing and shopping.
 China's tourists stand apart from other tourists in other ways, say members of Singapore's hospitality industry.
 ''They're more demanding,'' said Johnson Lim, who handles groups from China for a local travel agency. Boon Sang Lip, a souvenir stand operator, put it more bluntly: ''They like to talk in a loud and not very polite way,'' he said as a group of tourists from Xian in China mobbed his assistant for lighters in the shape of Singapore's emblem, the mythical half-lion, half-fish Merlion.
 When they check into hotels, for instance, many tourists from China demand the top floors, Mr. Lim said. Some feel entitled to take souvenirs like hotel pillows, he said.
 Some Chinese tourists do not hesitate to stub cigarettes out on hotel carpets, complained Diana Chong, director of sales and marketing at a local three-star hotel. ''They think when they pay that much money they should get a lot,'' she said.
 Other China tourists believe that they should not pay so much at all. ''Sometimes they try to bargain and ask if they can have a discount,'' said Andy Wong, a clerk in a sporting goods store that, like most stores here, has fixed prices. Occasionally, these confrontations go further. Man Lim, a jewelry clerk, recalled one tourist from China slamming a calculator down on a glass counter when denied a 50 percent discount.
 None of this may come as a surprise to anyone who has traveled through China. In a nation of 1.3 billion people, getting where you want to go often means literally pushing someone else out of the way.
 But much of the behavior stems from inexperience. Chinese citizens may travel only to countries on a government-approved list. Individual travel, while possible, requires onerous paperwork, so most Chinese travel in large groups.
 China's labor laws also require most citizens to take their vacations around three major holidays: the Lunar New Year holiday in late January and early February; May Day; and National Day on Oct. 1, which initiates a weeklong vacation period. 
 For all the challenges, China's tourist migrations represent a lucrative source of income that countries like Singapore are vying to attract. Casinos are one case in point. With casinos illegal in China, virtually every trip abroad includes such a visit. Gambling losses by Chinese visitors overseas amount to $72 billion a year, according to CLSA.
 ''Chinese love to gamble,'' Mr. Lim said. While wealthier visitors to Singapore often take a cruise with a casino onboard, he said, package tours to Singapore usually encompass a visit to casinos in Malaysia. Hotels in Ho Chi Minh City in Vietnam have installed slot machines. In Ha Long city in Vietnam, a casino has been built to complement the natural beauty of Ha Long Bay.
 Singapore lifted a 40-year ban on casinos this year and is now seeking bids to build two casino resorts. But officials deny they are pandering to China's love of gambling.
 ''Yes, there may be a group of Chinese tourists interested in gambling facilities,'' said Edmund Chua, regional director for China at the Singapore Tourism Board, ''but the majority we're getting now are nongambling tourists, families and travelers who are here just to have fun.''

HEADLINE: A Bill Advancing Digital TV Is Approved by Senate Panel 

BYLINE: By STEPHEN LABATON

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 20 

 BODY:
A Senate panel approved legislation on Thursday to complete the slow transition from analog to digital television by 2009, a change of enormous importance to the television, cable and wireless telephone industries.
 The legislation, cleared by the Senate Commerce Committee by a vote of 19 to 3, has gained considerable momentum because it could raise billions of dollars for a depleted federal treasury from auctions for the spectrum licenses that would be surrendered by broadcasters.
Emergency workers have been heavily lobbying for the legislation so they can have better communication systems during disasters like Hurricane Katrina. And the lawmakers are being pressed by industry groups, most notably the wireless phone companies, to accelerate the transition to auction the spectrum licenses so that the carriers can expand and improve their phone and wireless Internet services. 
 Equipment makers also see the legislation as a possible bonanza because it would prompt consumers and subscription television services to buy upgrades. It also offers the hope of encouraging greater use of wireless online services.
 But the bill faces considerable political obstacles, as the various industries squabble over its terms. A significant issue is how to pay for the technology necessary to prevent an estimated 70 million to 80 million television sets from being rendered obsolete once broadcasters no longer provide analog programs. 
 Those are the sets that do not rely on subscription services provided by cable and satellite companies. The matter is of enough political sensitivity that the lawmakers set April 7, 2009, as the legislation's effective date. (Not coincidentally, that is one day after the widely watched Final Four N.C.A.A. basketball tournament.)
 The legislation approved by the committee was sponsored by its Republican chairman, Senator Ted Stevens of Alaska, and the ranking Democrat, Senator Daniel K. Inouye of Hawaii. The three Democratic senators who voted against the measure were Barbara Boxer of California, John Kerry of Massachusetts, and John D. Rockefeller IV of West Virginia.
 It would provide $3 billion for owners of those sets to buy converter boxes that would let them receive digital signals. A similar bill, expected to be considered soon in the House, is likely to try to trim that amount, Congressional aides said. 
 The measure now moves to the Senate Budget Committee, where it could be considered as early as next week, before being introduced on the floor.
 The legislation is the latest measure in a decades-long push toward digital transmission, which would make more efficient use of the communications spectrum and enable broadcasters to offer better-quality pictures as well as the prospect of interactivity. 
 As part of the transition, the government gave the broadcasters use of frequencies for both digital and analog transmission, and policy makers want to accelerate the process to get back the analog portion to sell in the market. 
 The licenses to be returned to the government are among the most desirable around. They are considered the beachfront property of the spectrum because of their special characteristics -- they cover large distances and the signals easily penetrate buildings.
 Under existing law, the broadcasters were supposed to return that part of the spectrum at the later of two dates -- Dec. 31, 2006, or when 85 percent of households receive digital signals. Experts said the 85 percent requirement threatened to delay the transition for many years, although broadcasters long lobbied against setting a more immediate deadline. More than half of homes now have no digital signal and no intention to get one, according to Stewart Wolpin, an analyst at Points North Group, a research and consulting firm. 
 The legislation adopted on Thursday was silent on one of the most contentious issues posed by the switch to digital programs -- whether cable companies would be required to carry all the new digital programs transmitted by broadcasters. The new technology enables the broadcasters to transmit up to six programs simultaneously in the same space where they now transmit one.
 They have insisted on legislation that imposes digital ''must carry'' provisions because, they say, it is essential to the economics of the industry. But the cable companies have balked, arguing that such a requirement would be too costly. 
 The broadcasters and the cable companies have produced competing studies, with cable providers complaining that the costs involved in must carry provisions could be billions of dollars, although some independent analysts have taken issue with the studies.
 A recent report on the matter by analysts at Legg Mason said, ''We view these statements as normal political hyperbole and would note that the worst-case scenarios are unlikely to play out as argued in the context of lobbying.'' 
 Another behind-the-scenes fight has been brewing over how the government should allocate the so-called ''white space'' on the spectrum, which viewers now see on those channels that do not carry programs, like Channel 3 in New York. Some technology and Internet service providers, along with consumer groups, have petitioned the Federal Communications Commission to approve a new generation of unlicensed wireless devices to make use of the white space. 
 Their efforts are opposed by the broadcasters, who say that those devices would interfere with broadcasting transmission.
 The transition has also prompted lobbying by the equipment makers, including Cisco Systems and Intel, and by software companies like Microsoft, which has urged lawmakers to preserve a significant amount of the spectrum for free or unlicensed use. Several lobbyists said this week they had heard from lawmakers that in recent months Bill Gates, Microsoft's co-founder, had pressed the issue with members of Congress.
 A spokeswoman in the Washington office of Microsoft, Ginny Terzano, declined to provide details about Mr. Gates's conversations with lawmakers. She said the company was not seeking a provision for unlicensed spectrum use in the bill adopted on Thursday but generally favors such unlicensed spectrum.
 ''We look forward,'' she said, ''to working with the Congress to explore future opportunities to make more unlicensed spectrum available to promote greater wireless broadband deployment, and the ability to deliver new and interesting products.''

HEADLINE: Bloomberg Looks Downtown to Expand Legacy

BYLINE: By CHARLES V. BAGLI

 BODY:
Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, looking perhaps to expand his economic development legacy beyond the Far West Side of Manhattan, announced last week that he wanted to play a bigger role in redeveloping Lower Manhattan. 
 The relative absence of the mayor in one of the largest redevelopment projects in the city -- a task troubled by delays, political fights and indecision -- has not been lost on voters. In opinion polls, they have said they would like the mayor to take over the process downtown.
But just how much control Mr. Bloomberg can actually grab, and how much his efforts will differ from the moves he has made all along in the downtown rebuilding process, are very much in question. 
 Gov. George E. Pataki holds most of the reins of power downtown. Mr. Pataki and his counterpart in New Jersey, Acting Gov. Richard J. Codey, control the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which owns the World Trade Center site. Mr. Pataki created the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation and controls the other major agencies and financial authorities that play the central roles downtown. 
 It was Mr. Pataki who ultimately selected the master plan for the 16-acre trade center site. 
 But Mayor Bloomberg has not been without some voice in every decision made in the 46 months since he took office. In 2002, he delivered a well-received presentation to top business leaders of his vision for Lower Manhattan in the 21st century. 
 Further, his administration tried -- unsuccessfully -- to seize control of the rubble-strewn 16 acres in 2002 by offering to swap the land beneath the city's airports for the trade center site.
 ''The mayor's been a great partner,'' said John P. Cahill, the governor's point man downtown.
 But Mr. Bloomberg all but turned his attention away from Lower Manhattan when he struck a tacit agreement in 2004 with the governor in which Mr. Pataki would take the lead in rebuilding Lower Manhattan. Mr. Bloomberg, meanwhile, staked his legacy on his quest to build a West Side football stadium for the Jets and secure the 2012 Summer Olympics.
 That deal has led to decidedly mixed results for both men. Mr. Bloomberg's failure to persuade the State Legislature to bless the stadium deal was perhaps his administration's most embarrassing setback. And there is a public perception that progress downtown has been sluggish at best, and that the Pataki administration is responsible.
 For instance, the governor took a political hit in the spring when Goldman Sachs, perhaps the most important downtown tenant, came close to abandoning the district, a possibility that might have touched off an exodus of other financial giants.
 But the mayor's critics say Mr. Bloomberg did not raise the alarm that Goldman Sachs was ready to move to Midtown if the city and the state could not straighten out security issues relating to the property.
 In the end, Goldman Sachs resumed its headquarters project downtown, but not before the city and the state were forced to provide a far richer package of tax incentives, tax-free financing and inexpensive rent. 
 ''The mayor's preoccupation with the Olympics and development on the Far West Side proved costly to the rebuilding effort in Lower Manhattan,'' said Bettina Damiani, director of Good Jobs New York, a fiscal policy group that investigates and publicizes the way governmental development resources are used. 
 Ms. Damiani added, ''It's ironic that our businessman mayor, who claimed that companies don't make location decisions based on tax breaks, was asleep at the wheel for the largest giveaway of 9/11 resources.''
 Further, proponents of the Freedom Center also grouse that the mayor could have been more vocal in his opposition to the political forces that led to its demise. But the mayor's desire to take a greater leadership role has come at two critical moments: nearing the end of his re-election effort, and at the beginning of the construction phase downtown. 
 A number of issues are nearing decisions that will determine what the trade center site and rest of Lower Manhattan will ultimately look like. Battles are raging over the pace of building the planned office, retail and cultural spaces. This includes at the trade center site, along the East River waterfront and at the Fulton Street corridor.
 For instance, the mayor could pick a side in the battle between the Port Authority and Larry A. Silverstein, the developer who holds the lease to the trade center site. The authority's chairman, Anthony R. Coscia, says that the retail part of the project should be built as soon as possible, to animate the site, provide jobs and spark development on nearby office sites. Mr. Silverstein says that much retail space would interfere with his plans to build offices there. 
 Further, now that the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation has earmarked $400 million in federal funds for off-site projects, the mayor could also put more energy into his own initiatives. Fulton Street and the East River waterfront, for example, have been scaled back from Mr. Bloomberg's original 2002 proposals.
 At the very least, the mayor could use his high public profile, said Petra Todorovich, a senior planner at the Regional Plan Association.
 ''Right now, New Yorkers want a leader downtown,'' Ms. Todorovich said. ''His voice could be incredibly important in the leadership vacuum that exists downtown. He could motivate action on a number of issues.''
 The Bloomberg administration denies that the mayor forgot about downtown. Edward Skyler, the mayor's spokesman, said, ''For as long as he is mayor, Lower Manhattan -- both on and off of the World Trade Center site -- will be a top priority.''
 City Councilwoman Christine C. Quinn, from Manhattan, took a more cynical view. ''I think the mayor was making a campaign statement as opposed to giving a clear indication of where mayoral resources and political muscle were going to go,'' she said. ''If it had been an indication of a reordering of priorities, we would have seen a much stronger reaction from Governor Pataki.''

HEADLINE: New Jersey Poll Finds Weariness With Attack Ads

BYLINE: By DAVID KOCIENIEWSKIand MEGAN THEE; Marjorie Connelly and Marina Stefan contributed reporting for this article.

 BODY:
The two wealthy candidates for governor in New Jersey have spent tens of millions of dollars promoting themselves and attacking each other. But voters have little confidence that either man can solve what they say are the state's most pressing problems -- soaring property taxes and widespread government corruption, according to a New York Times Poll.
 Voters also expressed disgust in interviews at the caustic tone of the race, saying that the two men should do a better job explaining their plans rather than exchanging volleys in misleading television ads. Though both candidates have sought to portray each other as captives of party bosses, voters said overwhelmingly that they expected insiders to continue to exert undue influence no matter which man is elected.
With less than three weeks left in the race, the most expensive campaign for governor in New Jersey history, United States Senator Jon S. Corzine, the Democratic candidate, was leading his Republican opponent, the businessman Douglas R. Forrester, 46 percent to 37 percent among likely voters in the poll, taken Friday through Wednesday. Among all registered voters, Mr. Corzine was ahead, 48 to 33. 
 But the survey also included worrisome findings for Mr. Corzine. 
 In a state where voters traditionally decide which lever to pull in the final days of a campaign, 14 percent of likely voters were undecided, and one-third of those who signaled support for a candidate said they may still change their mind. Mr. Corzine also remains potentially vulnerable to Mr. Forrester's promise to clean up rampant corruption by sweeping Democrats out of office.
 While the survey's respondents gave both men nearly identical marks for personal integrity and moral values, they said by a 10-point margin that the Democratic Party was more likely than the Republican Party to have corrupt politicians. The poll also found that the more closely voters followed the campaign, the less likely they were to support Mr. Corzine.
 On the issue voters identified as their top concern -- high property taxes and taxes in general -- neither candidate has persuaded voters that they can give homeowners relief. Mr. Forrester has promised to cut property taxes by 30 percent over three years; Mr. Corzine has called for a 40 percent increase in property tax rebates over four years. But only 15 percent believe Mr. Forrester's election would lower their property taxes, while 8 percent said they would expect a drop in their taxes if Mr. Corzine wins.
 The statewide telephone poll was conducted with 1,013 adults, including 869 registered voters and 750 likely voters. The margin of error for the entire sample is plus or minus 3 percentage points; for registered voters, it is plus or minus 3 percentage points; and for likely voters, it is plus or minus 4 percentage points.
 Over all, the poll provides a portrait of an unsettled public. Only 25 percent believe the state is adequately prepared to deal with a terrorist attack, with one-third scared that an attack will take place near their homes. 
 The sharp increase in energy prices also has people concerned: 56 percent say that increased gasoline prices have forced them to cut back on other spending, and 70 percent say they are worried about being able to pay their home heating bills this winter. Sixty-eight percent said they had a hard time keeping up with their bills. And 78 percent said there was a shortage of reasonably priced housing. 
 Voters also expressed some uncertainty about New Jersey's immediate future. While 58 percent think the state's economy is good, 33 percent think it is getting worse, compared with 13 percent who believe it is improving and 52 percent who expect it to stay the same.
 Only 41 percent said they were confident that Mr. Corzine would make the right decisions about the economy, while 45 percent said they were uneasy; 32 percent were confident in Mr. Forrester, while 52 percent were uneasy.
 That skittishness and the scathing tone of the campaign advertising have left many voters disillusioned.
 ''I am totally undecided as to who I am voting for,'' said Al MacDonald, 43, in a follow-up interview after the poll was completed. ''I am a registered Democrat. This entire campaign from both sides has been nothing but bashing, and I'm really disgusted with it. I haven't heard a single issue addressed except for a couple of halfhearted plans attempting to reduce taxes. Nothing in depth. Just bashing from both sides of the fence.''
 Mr. MacDonald, a municipal superintendent from Linden, said he wished that Acting Gov. Richard J. Codey was in the race.
 Miriam Roulette, a registered Republican from Princeton, said she had grown so weary of the campaign that she no longer listens to the commercials or debates for more than a few minutes.
 ''I get so angry and I think life is too short to care that much about it,'' said Mrs. Roulette, 77. ''I may very well not vote this time, and it's the first time since I was 18 years old. That gives you an idea of how disgusted I am. I can't muster up any respect for either one.''
 For all of the complaining about the candidates and their campaign ads, both Mr. Forrester and Mr. Corzine appear to have consolidated their bases. Mr. Forrester led Mr. Corzine 77 to 8 among likely voters who are Republicans. And despite the Forrester campaign's advertisements aimed at luring corruption-weary Democrats to cross party lines, the poll found that Mr. Corzine held a 81 to 7 edge among likely Democratic voters. Mr. Corzine also ran stronger among independent likely voters, 44 to 32. Independent voters make up about 30 percent of the state's electorate.
 The survey results suggest that voters hold a complex set of attitudes about New Jersey's reputation for public corruption, which has been magnified in recent years by a succession of scandals and the resignation of former Gov. James E. McGreevey in August 2004. 
 While Mr. Forrester has been unrelenting in his effort to link Mr. Corzine to the state's Democratic powerbrokers, Mr. Corzine appears to have blunted the effectiveness of that appeal by raising questions about Mr. Forrester's business, BeneCard Services, a pharmacy benefits management company that holds millions of dollars in no-bid contracts with municipalities in the state.
 The poll found that 73 percent of voters thought Democratic Party powerbrokers would wield influence on a Corzine administration, while 69 percent believed that Mr. Forrester would be swayed by his party leaders.
 Deborah Whalen-Casler, a Republican from Aberdeen, said she had been put off by Mr. Forrester's attempts to link Mr. Corzine to tainted Democrats. ''Instead of talking about what he was planning on doing, he was more knocking Corzine every chance he got,'' said Ms. Whaler-Casler, 48, an unemployed investment banker. ''He brought up 'his cronies did this, his cronies did that.' I didn't want to hear that.''
 Mr. Corzine appears to have found little traction in his effort to weigh down Mr. Forrester by associating him with President Bush and Washington Republicans, even though 55 percent of respondents disapproved of the President's job performance. By a 55-39 margin, they also said it was a mistake for the United States to have taken military action in Iraq.
 But few voters saw the race as a referendum on the Bush administration. Eleven percent said they would cast their vote to support the president, 27 percent said they were voting to register their opposition to Mr. Bush, and 58 percent said it was not about Mr. Bush at all.

How the Poll Was Conducted
 The latest New York Times Poll of New Jersey is based on telephone interviews conducted Oct. 14 through 19 with 1,013 adults throughout the state. Of those, 869 said they were registered to vote. 
 The sample of telephone exchanges called was selected by a computer from a complete list of New Jersey exchanges. The exchanges were chosen so as to assure that each area of the state was represented in proportion to its population. For each exchange, the telephone numbers were formed by random digits, thus permitting access to both listed and unlisted numbers. Within each household one adult was designated by a random procedure to be the respondent for the survey. 
 The results have been weighted to take account of household size and number of telephone lines into the residence, and to adjust for variations in the sample relating to geographic region, race, sex, age, education, and marital status.
 In addition, the questions about voting preferences in the 2005 election for governor are based on the responses of 750 ''likely voters,'' weighted according to their probability of voting, defined in terms of registration, intention to vote, attention to the campaign and past voting behavior. 
 In theory, in 19 cases out of 20 the results based on such samples will differ by no more than 3 percentage points in either direction from what would have been obtained by seeking out all adult residents of New Jersey. 
 For smaller subgroups the potential sampling error is larger. For example, it is plus or minus 4 percentage points for ''likely voters.'' 
 In addition to sampling error, the practical difficulties of conducting any survey of public opinion may introduce other sources of error into the poll. Differences in the wording and order of questions, for instance, can lead to somewhat varying results.

HEADLINE: Bush Presses Abbas to Confront Armed Gangs 

BYLINE: By STEVEN R. WEISMAN

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 20 

 BODY:
President Bush pressed the Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas, on Thursday to ''confront the threat that armed gangs pose to a genuinely democratic Palestine'' but cautioned that a Palestinian state living peacefully with Israel might not be established before Mr. Bush leaves office in 2009.
 Meeting at the White House, Mr. Abbas and Mr. Bush promised to push the negotiating process with Israel forward, and Mr. Bush called on Israel, as he has many times, to ease conditions for Palestinians on the West Bank and stop expanding settlements there and in Jerusalem. 
But there was no sign that any progress had been achieved on these or other issues over which Israel and the Palestinian leadership have been at odds since the pullout of Israeli settlers from Gaza in August . 
 An impasse also remained with Israel over the Palestinian demand for more freedom of movement in and out of Gaza and in the West Bank, where Israeli roadblocks and checkpoints are prevalent.
 It remained unclear on Thursday evening to what extent American officials had reaffirmed their appeal to Mr. Abbas and his aides to renew and tighten requirements in legislative elections in January that would require candidates to renounce violence and ''undemocratic'' methods.
 The appeal for a such a change, disclosed earlier in the week, was made by American officials as a way to prevent Hamas and other militant groups from gaining a foothold in the Palestinian legislature. 
 Publicly, Mr. Abbas reiterated the Palestinian position that it would be better to get an agreement on disavowing violence after the legislative council is elected than before.
 Referring to his oft-repeated slogan about ''one authority and one law,'' shorthand for the goal of disarming Hamas and other groups, Mr. Abbas said, ''The new legislative council will be mandated by the people to legislate and issue these slogans and make them a reality.''
 Some Palestinian representatives involved in the talks said that Mr. Abbas and his aides had not ruled out at least trying to pass a law on violence before the election as the administration wants.
 ''As a practical matter, they think that the new members of the Parliament will be more amenable to pass these laws than the present one,'' said Ziad J. Asali, president of the American Task Force on Palestine. ''They're comfortable that it will pass then. But they do not rule it out now.''
 The Gaza and West Bank issues have been the focus of work by the special envoy, James D. Wolfensohn, the former World Bank president, who Mr. Bush announced would continue to serve as envoy at least until spring.
 ''It's important that we make quick progress on the issues that Jim has identified as most critical for the Palestinian economy,'' Mr. Bush said, citing the Gaza access issues. ''These are all practical steps that will help the Palestinian economy grow and flourish.''
 Despite the lack of movement on the access issues, American, Palestinian and Israeli officials say that some progress has occurred recently and that all sides are discussing the possibility that two main crossing points would be built in southwestern Gaza -- Rafah for people and Kerem Shalom for goods.
 Discussions are also said to be under way to enlist European participation in some sort of customs station at Kerem Shalom, but Israel was said to be resisting this idea.
 Part of the difficulty in getting Israel to move on the crossing issues, and on easing checkpoints and roadblocks, is that Prime Minister Ariel Sharon has said that after the trauma of pulling settlers out of Gaza, Israel cannot act to help the Palestinians unless Mr. Abbas does more to disarm Hamas and other militant groups. Israeli resolve was hardened after an attack on Israeli civilians last weekend, American and Israeli officials say. 
 Mr. Sharon's aides have pressed Mr. Bush to back Israel's demand that armed groups be barred from fielding candidates in the Palestinian legislative elections in January.
 The issue of how much the Bush administration is willing to push Israel remains a source of bitterness within Mr. Abbas's team. Israelis, by contrast, are frustrated that the United States favors disarming Hamas and other groups but is letting Mr. Abbas try to bring them into the political process rather than confronting them militarily.
 Reading a statement, Mr. Bush noted that ''achieving peace demands action from all parties'' and that Israel must ''help improve the daily lives of Palestinians'' and do nothing that ''contravenes'' its obligations to end settlement expansion.
 But administration officials have said privately since the Gaza withdrawal that Mr. Sharon needs some breathing room to fend off critics on the right who say he gave too much away. The administration also has signaled that Israel should not take bold steps to expand settlements, embarrassing Mr. Bush by rendering his appeals hollow.

HEADLINE: Away From Wall St. But Not Too Far 

BYLINE: By LANDON THOMAS Jr.

 BODY:
Sliding into a banquette at the barroom in the Four Seasons in Manhattan, Jeffrey M. Peek calls for a glass of red wine and makes the case that there is life after Wall Street.
 A former top executive at Merrill Lynch and Credit Suisse First Boston, Mr. Peek is the chief executive of CIT, the commercial leasing company and he has some grand plans to inject some of his investment banking panache into what has been a solid if unspectacular enterprise.
''It's pretty exciting,'' he said last week with a broad grin. ''We are at the crux of where entrepreneurship is funded. I can get excited about that.'' 
 The barroom at the Four Seasons is not where one would expect to meet the chief executive of a company that does much of its leasing and lending to small-to-midsize companies. 
 But for Mr. Peek, a Manhattan native and a patron of the city's arts, his choice is symbolic of his aim to bring some renewed energy and flash to a sleepy company that has had five owners -- among them, Tyco International under L. Dennis Kozlowski -- since 1980.
 In his 14 months at the helm, Mr. Peek has hired 15 mergers and acquisition bankers to offer strategic advice to CIT's clients and has sold off a chunk of noncore businesses. By early next year, he expects to be moving into an office at the company's new global headquarters, the CIT Building, opposite the New York Public Library. All of which is part of his goal to diversify the firm's business mix, increase the productivity and competitive spirit of his employees and, in the end, make CIT more relevant.
 ''In general CIT is a great platform, but it has been underdeveloped in some ways,'' he said. ''Everybody has heard of CIT, they just don't know what has happened currently. We have to work on that.''
 For Mr. Peek, who lost a bitter and very public power struggle for the top slot at Merrill Lynch and who was the No. 2 executive at Credit Suisse when it was in the regulatory cross hairs, laboring outside the public eye has been something of an adjustment. Having survived the Wall Street gantlet of boardroom intrigues and regulatory land mines, he is finally running his own company; it just seems that few have taken notice.
 Doesn't he miss the buzz of the trading room and the lure of the big deal? Evidently not.
 ''I feel closer to the heartbeat of American economy than I did during those years on Wall Street,'' he said. ''We live with these clients; it is not just every four years when they want to do a stock offering.''
 While CIT's core business has been new to Mr. Peek, the travel and intensive client work harks back to his days as a globe-trotting investment banker. Mr. Peek is also hoping that his emphasis on higher-return fee businesses, like his advisory group, and a fresh focus on new areas like education and health care, will serve as the motor for CIT's growth.
 Since he was appointed chief executive in July 2004 -- he became chairman last January -- CIT has shown consistent, if unspectacular earnings growth. Quarterly profit announced this week grew 23 percent over the previous year, thanks to higher lease margins, asset sales and strong growth in fee income. Return on equity came in at 17 percent, up from 14 percent a year ago and surpassing the 15 percent goal that Mr. Peek had publicly set for the company last year. 
 The stock has also been a steady performer, up 16 percent since Mr. Peek became chief executive, handily beating the returns of such larger lenders as Citigroup and J.P. Morgan during that time, though lagging behind the top brokerage stocks, including Merrill.
 Part of Mr. Peek's mission is to make CIT stand on its own feet. Since 1980, the company has been owned by RCA, Manufacturers Hanover, Chemical, Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank of Japan and, most infamously, Tyco in 2001. Since the company was spun off from Tyco in 2002, the stock has doubled. Still, the $9 billion market value gives CIT a small enough size to make it an attractive target for an acquisitive Wall Street bank. So, will another buyer come along?
 ''I can't say never, it's happened five times in the past two decades,'' Mr. Peek said. ''But there is a strong culture with competitive people who want to do the right thing. We have a significant growth plan.'' 
 Mr. Peek has given himself five years to accomplish his goals. He is challenging his sales force to spend more time with clients and he is doing all that he can to broaden the company's array of products. Ultimately, he hopes to push earnings ($758 million last year) close to $1.5 billion in the next five years. 
 Despite his obvious contentment, there is no hiding an inner restlessness that may be a legacy of his time on Wall Street, where time horizons are measured by the quarter and the focus remains on the short term.
 ''I'm a reasonably happy guy, but I could be happier,'' he said. ''We have to do better. We have to keep the R.O.E. above 15 percent. And our P.E. is now 10 -- I'd like to get it up to 12 to 15 times.''

HEADLINE: Senate Retains Money for Disputed Alaska Bridges and Other Pet Initiatives

BYLINE: By CARL HULSE

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 20 

 BODY:
The growing Congressional fight over spending spilled over to the sensitive subject of lawmakers' home-state projects as the Senate rejected efforts on Thursday to block money for two widely criticized Alaskan bridges, as well as other pet initiatives.
 Senator Tom Coburn, a freshman Republican from Oklahoma, forced the issue by trying to use a transportation and housing spending bill to eliminate $450million for two bridges in Alaska, one of which has been called ''the bridge to nowhere.''
Mr. Coburn took aim at other allocations, as well, including $950,000 for a museum parking lot in Nebraska, $500,000 for a sculpture park in Seattle and $200,000 for an animal shelter in Rhode Island, all favorites of individual senators. 
 Mr. Coburn argued that priorities that led to such spending were out of whack given the cost of recovery from the Gulf Coast hurricanes and the mounting federal deficit. He proposed that $75million from the bridges be redirected to rebuild badly damaged bridges on Interstate 10 outside New Orleans. 
 ''This is a battle of philosophies,'' said Mr. Coburn, who has been pressing for spending cuts to pay for hurricane recovery.
 His drive plainly irked many colleagues, who did not take kindly to his meddling in their pursuit of money for specific projects, known to Congress as earmarks and to others as pork.
 ''I don't need a senator from Oklahoma telling me what's good in Missouri or telling the senator from Washington what's good for the state of Washington,'' said Senator Christopher S. Bond, Republican of Missouri and an author of the bill.
 The two Alaska senators were incensed that Mr. Coburn would single out the bridges, which have come under criticism around the country as wasteful because of their high cost in relation to the small populations they would serve. 
 ''Most of you don't understand who we are up there and what we need,'' Senator Lisa Murkowski, Republican of Alaska, said. 
 She and Senator Ted Stevens, the state's senior Republican lawmaker and a Senate power, said the bridges would help the Alaska economy and population grow.
 ''This is not the way to treat a state,'' said Mr. Stevens, who helped bring Alaska to statehood and threatened to resign his seat should the Senate agree to block the money. ''These bridges are necessary.''
 Mr. Coburn said it was not his intention to portray the projects he singled out as lacking merit. 
 ''It may be a good idea,'' he said. ''But the priority is out of line with what our fiscal needs are, and it's certainly out of line with what the American people would be expecting us to spend their money on.'' 
 The Senate defeated the provision to eliminate the local projects, 86 to 13, and opposed Mr. Coburn's bridge plan, 82 to 15. 
 Before adopting the $141billion measure, 93 to 1, senators also defeated an effort to add more than $3billion for home-heating assistance for low-income families. The proposal, by New England lawmakers who fear sky-high heating costs this winter, failed to attract the 60 votes that Senate procedures require.
 ''High energy prices can cause families to choose between keeping the heat on, putting food on the table or paying for much-needed prescription medicine,'' said Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine, who sponsored the plan along with Senator Jack Reed, Democrat of Rhode Island. ''These are choices that no American family should ever have to make.''
 As part of the bill, the Senate also approved a plan to close the office of a special counsel appointed more than 10 years ago to investigate former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Henry G. Cisneros. Mr. Cisneros pleaded guilty in 1999 to lying during a background investigation and was pardoned in 2001. 
 Senator Byron L. Dorgan, Democrat of North Dakota, said the inquiry has cost nearly $22million, including $930,742 in expenses for the six months that ended on March 31.
 Under the plan he offered along with Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa, the special counsel would be required to issue a final report within 60 days of the measure's being enacted and to close the office 45 days later. 
 Mr. Dorgan said, ''It's time for this to end.''

HEADLINE: Mayor of New Orleans Vows to Rebuild 2 Devastated Areas

BYLINE: By CHRISTINE HAUSER

DATELINE: NEW ORLEANS, Oct. 20 

 BODY:
Mayor C. Ray Nagin gave a firm commitment on Thursday to the rebuilding of the destroyed Lower Ninth Ward and New Orleans East, clearing up doubts that had grown in the city about whether his administration would allow residents to return to the hard-hit areas.
 ''Read my lips,'' he said. ''We will rebuild New Orleans East. We will rebuild the Lower Ninth Ward.'' 
For weeks, residents of the neighborhoods have chafed at their inability to inspect their property, having been prevented from returning by official concerns about safety and openly expressing concern that they might never be allowed to rebuild. Many houses in the Lower Ninth Ward, east of the Industrial Canal, were destroyed, with some swept off their foundations after Hurricane Katrina's floodwaters spilled over surrounding levees.
 Then on Tuesday, appearing before a House subcommittee in Washington, the mayor seemed to suggest that the future of the neighborhoods remained an open question. According to The Times-Picayune of New Orleans, he told lawmakers that the questions of how to protect the areas east of the canal had ''not been answered yet.''
 ''The rest of the city we can rebuild,'' he was quoted as saying.
 Asked at a news conference on Thursday to explain those comments, he said he was referring to the need to restore water service, electricity and flood protection before the neighborhood could be rebuilt.
 ''Everything that we do is about public safety as relates to the recovery efforts,'' he said.
 The city's Sewerage and Water Board said in a statement on Thursday that workers had started to test the water mains in sections of New Orleans East, which Mr. Nagin called a ''big step forward.''
 Mr. Nagin said after the news conference that the residents of the areas would be given ''the levee protection that they need to rebuild.''
 ''They may rebuild a little different,'' he said, ''but they are going to rebuild.''
 Mr. Nagin spoke at a news conference with Gov. Kathleen Babineaux Blanco of Louisiana, who said the city's tourism industry would be ''up and running'' by the end of the year and for Mardi Gras next year. She said preparing New Orleans for Mardi Gras was like a household preparing for expected guests.
 ''You get the house in order no matter what it takes,'' Governor Blanco said. ''I believe that we will be standing up by February.''
 Rejuvenating the tourism industry is one of Louisiana's first priorities because it brings in about $10 billion a year in economic activity. The state will lose more than $1 billion in direct tourism revenue by the end of this year, according to a statement by Lt. Gov. Mitchell J. Landrieu.
 Oliver Thomas, the City Council president, said New Orleans East and the Lower Ninth Ward together represent one of the city's largest residential and property tax bases.
 Mr. Thomas said he had sent an e-mail message to some members of the commission that has been set up to advise Mr. Nagin on rebuilding, calling for the group to draw up a plan eliminating any questions about whether the neighborhoods would be rebuilt.
 Cynthia Willard-Lewis, a City Council member who represents the Ninth Ward, said the city needs a plan for rebuilding public safety and managing the area's redevelopment.
 ''We have a golden opportunity to recreate our community,'' she said. She said a few businesses in New Orleans East, including car dealerships and hotels, are planning to reopen in January.

To the Editor:
 I participated in a National Academies panel whose recommendations led to the report that Thomas L. Friedman cites in ''Keeping Us in the Race'' (column, Oct. 14). 
 The last time the United States carried out a national strategy to improve our scientific competitiveness was also in response to another nation surpassing us technologically. Forty-eight years ago this month, the Soviets launched Sputnik. Soon after, Congress enacted the National Defense Education Act, which enabled almost 27,000 students to pursue doctoral study in fields of national need.
Mr. Friedman mentions the report's recommendation for new graduate fellowships, and calls its proposals a ''new New Deal.'' Indeed, we do need a bold new national program, specifically a new National Defense Education Act for the 21st century. This type of initiative would produce the highly trained work force needed to maintain American economic security and global leadership in innovation and research.

$35.
 It is attractive to think that once the ink dried on the Constitution, democracy in the United States took wing like the bald eagle. Attractive but wrong. Democracy was not in the cards, and that is exactly as intended by the framers, for whom the word implied mob rule and, as one Federalist leader put it as late as 1804, ''the government of the worst.'' A severely limited franchise and restricted access to the levers of government ensured that decision-making power remained in the hands of the right people.
Yet somehow, between the presidencies of Jefferson and Lincoln, the top-down government bequeathed by the founding fathers evolved into a more participatory, bottom-up government recognizable, in its broad outlines, as modern American democracy. The process was messy, the battles fiercely waged, and the outcome often in doubt. 
 ''American democracy did not rise like the sun at its natural hour in history,'' writes Sean Wilentz, a professor of history and director of the American studies program at Princeton University. ''Its often troubled ascent was the outcome of human conflicts, accommodations and unforeseen events, and the results could well have been very different than they were.'' He uses the term ''rupture,'' rather than ''evolution,'' to characterize the changes that reshaped the old ''politics of deference'' and installed in their place a system of government in which citizens did not merely select their rulers but also gained access to the machinery of government.
 ''The Rise of American Democracy'' goes over this contested terrain at great length and in great detail, with an emphasis on political ideas and party politics, rather than economics or social trends, as driving forces. Region by region, state by state, Mr. Wilentz traces the rude awakening of farmers, mechanics and the rest of the lesser fry who, in myriad ways, organized to demand their democratic rights and worked out the means to achieve them. 
 Progress was uneven. In Rhode Island it took something close to a civil war in the 1840's to overturn the state's colonial charter and loosen the grip on power of its landowning and merchant elite. In Louisiana the Creole elite in New Orleans held sway until a large influx of small farmers in the northern and central regions of the state exerted enough pressure to force a rewriting of the state's restrictive constitution in 1845. South Carolina retained its uncompromisingly aristocratic system of government until the end of the Civil War. 
 But by 1821, 21 of 24 states had eliminated property ownership as a requirement for voting, and in the election of 1828, more than a million Americans voted, four times the total of 1824. Voter turnout for the presidential election was 80 percent, a figure that held more or less steady for the rest of the 19th century. Women and blacks could not vote. But the vastly expanded pool of white male voters leapt at the opportunity to play an active political role unimaginable in the late 18th century. 
 Although Mr. Wilentz is a clear and (despite the book's enormous length) concise writer, with a gift for illuminating his points with telling quotes, he places heavy demands on the nonspecialist reader. Each and every political movement, no matter how transitory, gets its full day in court, whether Loco Focos, Hunkers, Barnburners or anti-Masons. Conscience Whigs, Cotton Whigs and Silver Grays parade past in a minutely differentiated parade that at times threatens to become a blur. 
 Mr. Wilentz, an elegant thinker, applies a very sharp scalpel when dissecting the differences between the thousand and one parties and movements that crowded the 19th-century American stage. Often, his political actors seem to be less like human beings than repositories of ideas that accumulate like neatly defined layers of sedimentary rock. 
 This habit of mind results in some highly compressed, challenging characterizations, like the ''volatile mixture of Workeyism, Loco Focoism and Christianity'' that defines the editor and writer Orestes Brownson, or the offhand description of the Illinois senator Stephen A. Douglas as epitomizing ''the moderate to conservative nationalist Democratic politician who had emerged in the North in the 1840's, at odds with Barnburner Jacksonian radicalism.'' 
 ''The Rise of American Democracy'' deserves to be read slowly. Mr. Wilentz takes on an enormous subject and articulates a grand theme, supported by a wealth of detailed scholarship. Inch by inch, he covers a broad expanse of ground, analyzing countless local struggles to widen the voting franchise, dislodge entrenched privilege and make good on the lofty promises of the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution. 
 His is not a happy story, although it ends hopefully. It is a record of struggle and strife, of combat in ideas that leads to actual combat, of earnest debate about the rights of man and universal equality in a country half slave and half free. 
 At a time when the United States is fighting a war to export democracy, Mr. Wilentz does a service in recalling the long, rocky road that America traveled to work out its own democratic contradictions. Better yet, he reminds us how fragile democracy is, and how new, in the scheme of things, are its habits and institutions.
 ''Their breakthrough, even in the most egalitarian portions of the New World, required enormous reversals of traditional assumptions about power and legitimacy,'' he writes. It took the Civil War to resolve incompatible visions of American democracy. Mr. Wilentz tells an American story, but its broader lessons apply to countries as different as Russia, Iraq and China.

HEADLINE: Debunking The Myths Of Budgeting

BYLINE: By M.P. Dunleavey. 
M.P. Dunleavey writes about personal finance for MSN Money.

 BODY:
MENTION the word ''budget,'' and watch people back away and look for something fun to read, like a carburetor manual. Budgeting smacks of dieting -- of self-denial and no goodies. Even phrases like ''I can't, I'm on a budget'' or ''I'm tightening my belt'' have overtones of deprivation and dry toast.
 There's a myth that budgets are only for people with money problems. If you make a good living, pay your bills, take a nice vacation every now and then -- why would you need one? 
Financial planners keep trying to reverse the negative spin on budgeting by giving it other names. ''Spending plan'' is a popular term. It sounds like permission to go shopping. But it reminds me of putting ketchup on lima beans -- you still know what's under there.
 Call it what you will, a budget is meant to cover three things: basic living costs, future goals and unexpected expenditures -- incurred when your laptop quits, heating bills take a hike, you fall in love with a suit at Nordstrom's.
 Thus the whole notion that a budget has to be an exercise in not spending, involving an Excel spreadsheet and constant guilt, is fundamentally wrong. A budget is all about spending. Even the parts of a budget devoted to savings are really about socking away money so you can spend it eventually. 
 And that's the secret to having a happy, healthy and sane money management system. Assume you're going to spend money on things that are invisible to you now -- and save an educated amount for those expenses, so you're not ambushed when they crop up. Which they will.
 A survey of 1,100 women by the Consumer Federation of America, found that 71 percent of respondents worried about money. Two-thirds of those worried said that unexpected expenses were the main source of their angst. Over the course of a year, those emergency costs came to about $2,000 a person, as a median figure. Most people didn't have that much set aside in savings. In fact, 55 percent of the women ages 24 to 35 didn't even have $500.
 Steven Brobeck, executive director for the federation, said that women earn less than men, on average, and might have more acute economic problems. Still, he said, ''The same savings messages apply to all Americans.'' 
 If you focus on savings, you'll never feel like you're anywhere near a budget. The trick is deciding how much to save in different categories. Then have your employer or bank automatically set aside those amounts. Studies show that you're likely to save more when you rely on Ma Technology to put the money aside for you.
 One rule of thumb is to save at least 10 percent of your gross salary for retirement in your 401(k) or I.R.A. If you earn $75,000 a year, that's $7,500, or $625 a month.
 You've also got to be prepared for the inevitable stream of short- and long-term expenses that arise, whether goals or emergencies -- anything from an unexpected wedding to a much-needed vacation or a broken furnace. Because it's hard to know what all your coming costs will be, one method is to save an additional 10 percent each for short- and long-term savings. Ideally you'd keep the long-term savings someplace where you won't touch it. 
 Don't choke. These are just target amounts. The idea is to salt away enough for things you can anticipate -- as well as what you can't, like being laid off. Financial planners often say it's a good idea to have three to six months' worth of living expenses saved for an emergency like that.
 I say, do the best you can -- but keep saving. If you decide you can't afford to save 20 percent of your income for life's little surprises, that's fine, as long as you set aside something, say, 5 percent in each savings bucket. If you have credit card debt, use some or all of the long-term savings to pay that down -- because eradicating debt is a form of savings.
 This isn't a traditional budget; it's a ''better living through saving'' plan. Yes, you may have to rethink your basic living costs to save a little more, but is that so bad? Money saved is money you'll need sooner or later. And it's cash you'll have and not have to borrow or even worry about. Because you budgeted for it.

HEADLINE: Mixed Finish Ends Five Days of Seesawing Trends

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Stocks had mixed results yesterday, with lackluster earnings from Caterpillar but strong earnings from Google. The major indexes were also mixed for the week. 
 The session closed a turbulent week for Wall Street as troubling economic data renewed worries about inflation, overshadowing mostly positive third-quarter profit reports from the nation's biggest companies.
 Although corporate earnings have so far been favorable, the market is battling three major headwinds: rising interest rates, inflation and high energy prices, said Michael Sheldon, chief investment strategist at Spencer Clarke. 
 ''The market needs a catalyst in order to get out of this difficult environment,'' Mr. Sheldon said. ''Hopefully, if oil prices continue to decline and move back into the mid-$50s, that could turn sentiment more positive on Wall Street.'' 
 The Dow Jones industrial average fell 65.88, or 0.6 percent, to close at 10,215.22. 
 The broader stock indicators advanced. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index added 1.79, or 0.15 percent, to 1,179.59, and the Nasdaq composite index rose 14.10, or 0.7 percent, to 2,082.21. 
 For the week, the Dow fell 0.7 percent and the S.&P. 500 lost 0.59 percent. The Nasdaq, however, rose 0.84 percent. Trading could be volatile again next week as another wave of companies release quarterly results. 
 Bonds gained ground, with the price of the 10-year Treasury note rising 12/32, to 98 30/32, and the yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, sliding to 4.38 percent from 4.43 percent on Thursday. The dollar was mixed against most major currencies, while gold prices edged lower. 
 Crude oil rose after lingering below $60 a barrel most of the day after recent government reports said petroleum inventories in the United States were expanding. A barrel of light crude added 61 cents, to settle at $60.63, on the New York Mercantile Exchange. 
 But with oil falling and recent data showing that higher prices have been limited to the energy industry, Wall Street may question whether the Federal Reserve is raising interest rates too high. Comments this week from three Fed officials suggested that the central bank remained committed to raising rates. 
 ''They have been repeatedly saying they're going to continue their mission of trying to restrain inflation,'' said Paul McManus, senior vice president at Independence Investments. ''They want to make sure oil inflation does not spread into core inflation.'' 
 Mr. McManus said he thought the stock market could rebound if oil prices continue sliding and inflation worries moderate. For now, investors are mostly reacting instead of speculating, he added. 
 Late Thursday, Google said its profit grew more than sevenfold, to $381.2 million, as revenue nearly doubled from new services in the typically slow summer season. Google rose $36.70, to $339.90. 
 Technology companies had another bright spot in the flash-memory maker SanDisk, which topped Wall Street estimates as profit almost doubled and revenue rose 45 percent. SanDisk gained $10.07, to $56.45. 
 Caterpillar, the construction equipment maker, posted a 34 percent rise in quarterly profit, but it cut its full-year outlook because of potential charges and a higher tax rate. Caterpillar dropped $5.11, to $48.92. 
 AT&T posted a $520 million quarterly profit, reversing a year-earlier loss. AT&T gained 43 cents, to $19.01. SBC Communications, which is buying AT&T, rose 46 cents, to $23. 
 Research in Motion tumbled $2.32, to $62.34, after a court denied its request to suspend a patent-infringement case with NTP that threatens to halt United States sales of its BlackBerry hand-held device. The company said it would ask the Supreme Court to review its case. 
 Advancing issues outpaced decliners nearly two to one on the New York Stock Exchange.

PERSON: Barrington Moore Jr. 

HEADLINE: Barrington Moore Jr., 92, Analyst of Totalitarianism

BYLINE: By WOLFGANG SAXON

 BODY:
Barrington Moore Jr., a Harvard sociologist whose studies of the contemporary human condition led him to dissect the totalitarian society, particularly as it evolved in the Soviet Union, died last Sunday at his home in Cambridge, Mass. He was 92.
 His death was announced by the university, where he taught from 1951 to 1979. He had also been affiliated with the Russian Research Center at Harvard since 1948. 
Dr. Moore followed an interdisciplinary approach, always placing social change in its historical context. He distrusted models of social behavior that ignored politics, economics and a multiplicity of other possible factors and events that helped determine it.
 His methodology had its roots in years he spent as a wartime strategic analyst for the O.S.S., the forerunner of the Central Intelligence Agency, and a stint at the interdisciplinary social science division of the University of Chicago.
 His best-known book, ''Social Origins of Dictatorship and Democracy: Lord and Peasant in the Making of the Modern World'' (Beacon, 1966), remains in print. J. H. Plumb, in a review for The New York Times, called it ''a profoundly important book.''
 Professor Plumb wrote that Dr. Moore had tackled a vast topic, namely ''the routes by which various countries have come to the modern industrial world.'' In discussing their significant differences, he also provided ''exceptionally perceptive'' social analyses to compare conditions in, say, India and Prussia, Professor Plumb suggested.
 ''In fact,'' he continued, ''the book is stuffed as a plum pudding with good things. And it is easy to read.''
 An earlier work, ''Soviet Politics: The Dilemma of Power'' (Harvard, 1950), helped ''sort out communism from Russianism,'' as The Times's reviewer Edward Crankshaw put it. Another, ''Injustice: The Social Bases of Obedience and Revolt'' (Sharpe, 1978), explored why people at the bottom of a society sometimes accept their victimization and why, under other circumstances, they man the barricades. 
 Dr. Moore's two most recent volumes are in print: ''Moral Aspects of Economic Growth and Other Essays'' (Cornell, 1998), and ''Moral Purity and Persecution in History'' (Princeton, 2000).
 Barrington Moore Jr. was born in Washington and graduated Phi Beta Kappa from Williams College. Having received his Ph.D. in sociology from Yale in 1941, he worked for the Justice Department and was posted as an analyst to the Office of Strategic Studies -- the wartime O.S.S. He joined the staff at Harvard in 1948 as a senior research fellow at the Russian Research Center.
 He is survived by a brother, Dr. Peter Van C. Moore, of Bethesda, Md.

HEADLINE: The Night That Never Happened

BYLINE: By Harry Hurt III

 BODY:
THERE'S nothing like being shot at to jump-start an unauthorized night out with the boys. The shots came early and out of left field, and they pretty much obliterated any clear memory of what happened between a blurry, blood-curdling moment of dodging bullets and the even blurrier Bloody Mary morning that followed.
 It all began innocently enough on a Tuesday night -- that I definitely do remember. I was sitting at a sidewalk cafe on the Upper East Side wearing a $620 custom-made suit and a pair of brand new Berluti shoes, a cellphone jammed against my ear. I had just told my wife, Alison, that I'd paid nearly $1,300 for the shoes.
''Oh, Bigger, that's good,'' she exclaimed. ''You don't do enough things like that for yourself.'' There was a pregnant pause. Then she said, ''Now go and have a few more tequilas, and stand in front of a store window on Madison Avenue that has something I want in it.'' 
 Silly Sisyphean me, I immediately misinterpreted my wife's words as a green light for the purest of all executive pursuits -- the pursuit of fun -- at the very next opportunity, which so happened to be the very next night. 
 In the interests of full disclosure, let me state that I am unapologetically and unequivocally pro-fun, and so, with notable exceptions relating to my own activities, is my wife. That can be risky, especially in New York City. As attested by various edicts of the past two mayoral administrations, including but not limited to the smoking ban and large-scale residential rezoning, the anti-fun forces have been waging a long-running insurgency. 
 Determined to rally the pro-fun forces, I hopped into a cab and hooked it across town to pick up a venture capitalist buddy I call the V.C., who is very rich, very hyper and very single. He sauntered out of his apartment building clutching a plastic tumbler filled with vodka.
 ''I've had a rough week,'' the V.C. groaned as he slipped into the cab. I noted that it was only Wednesday. He nodded and hoisted his tumbler. ''Want some?''
 I took a sip, and asked the cabbie to drive us downtown to West Chelsea. It was about half past nine, and the eve was but a pup. The air was still kind of warm and sultry; the bright lights of the city made the moon and the stars invisible to the naked eye. We were headed to a party courtesy of the publisher of Maxim magazine at Spirit nightclub featuring the legendary female punk rocker Joan Jett. I told the V.C. that our ostensible business purpose was journalistic research.
 ''Yeah,'' he chortled between gulps of vodka, ''right.''
 ''No, man, I'm serious,'' I said. ''Night life as we know it is facing a crisis that threatens its very existence.''
 As I reminded the V.C., that was no laughing matter for the New York City economy. According to a January 2004 report prepared for the New York Nightlife Association, the nightlife industry generates an estimated $9.7 billion in annual economic activity, including $2.6 billion in earnings (primarily wages) and 95,000 jobs. Annual attendance at night life spots, the report noted, is over 65 million admissions, more than three times the attendance of all New York City's sports teams combined.
 Over the last five years, the New York City night life industry has developed two increasingly popular epicenters: the meatpacking district between 14th and 19th Streets and the West Chelsea manufacturing district on 27th and 28th Streets. In those two areas and other nearby pro-fun pockets, there are no fewer than 22 establishments that have cabaret licenses and a combined occupational capacity of at least 20,500 people, according to data provided by Anthony M. Borelli, president of Community Board 4. 
 To me, all this sounded like a rock-'n'-rolling good time, but not to community leaders like Mr. Borelli, and not to City Hall. Earlier this year, the city planning board approved a large-scale rezoning of West Chelsea from manufacturing to mixed-use commercial. That, in turn, has opened the way for the addition of up to 2,000 new apartment units, even as the likes of Home Depot and P.C. Richard have opened stores in the area to capture an anticipated retail boom.
 ''Night life is being pushed out by residential encroachment after the investment of millions of dollars,'' complained Robert Bookman, a lawyer for the New York Nightlife Association. ''It's the same story that has been repeated over the years in SoHo, NoHo, TriBeCa and the Flatiron district.''
 Mr. Borelli, in a telephone interview, countered: ''We do recognize the importance of the night life industry to the city's economy. But the city is also facing a housing shortage, and a balance has to be struck between the quality of life of residents and night life.''
 When our cab turned up 10th Avenue toward West 27th Street, I looked over at the V.C. He was staring out the window at a darkened ball field near a housing project. Suddenly, his face turned pale. 
 ''Get down!'' he hollered. 
 The V.C. shoved me hard onto the floor of the cab, and threw himself on top of me. I heard three shots ring out. 
 ''Step on the gas'' the V.C. ordered our cabbie. ''And don't stop.''
 I felt the cab speed up and nose over to the left. Then I felt the V.C. straighten up. I peeked out the rear window of the cab, and saw two men in white T-shirts chasing a third man in a white sweatshirt into the darkness off 10th Avenue.
 We jumped out of the cab in front of Spirit on West 27th Street, pumping with adrenaline, then slipped into the party and began slamming adult beverages. 
 Somehow we became separated, and I was swallowed up by a crowd surging toward the stage to join Ms. Jett in a chorus of ''I Love Rock 'n' Roll.'' The next thing I knew, it was sunrise, and I was hunched over a desk in my wife's former bachelorette apartment on the Upper East Side, clutching a credit card receipt indicating I had spent $387.98 in Bungalow 8, a lounge across the street from Spirit owned by Amy Sacco, the queen of New York night life.
 A week later, trying to reconstruct the night that never happened in hopes of avoiding yet another banishment to Chateau Bow-Wow, aka the Doghouse, I paid Ms. Sacco a visit at her club.
 ''You wouldn't be in Chateau Bow-Wow if you'd gotten hit by the bullets,'' she purred in a whiskey-and-cigarettes voice that sounded like Bacall. 
 Ms. Sacco and I sat down at a banquette I had allegedly occupied a week earlier. I suddenly realized why my credit card receipt had been so high. There are only 10 tables in the entire joint, and if you want to hold one, you have to order at least one bottle of vodka -- which goes for $328.37, not including tip. 
 ''I know how we're going to get you out of Chateau Bow-Wow,'' Ms. Sacco said as she sipped a vodka-soda. ''We'll send your wife a Bungalow 8 bathrobe.''
 ''Maybe we should throw in a dozen roses,'' I suggested.
 ''No, no, the flowers would be too much,'' Ms. Sacco insisted. ''They'd show her you are guilty.''
 A few hours that seemed like a few minutes later, the bathrobe arrived. ''Men don't understand that women want to trust you,'' Ms. Sacco said. ''You don't have to be rich. Once in a while for no reason, without being asked, just pick up the garbage or take her on a romantic weekend. Look at her as a friend. Don't look at her as the enemy who hates you because you left the toilet seat up.''
 I kissed Ms. Sacco on the cheek, and she summoned a 6-foot-7, 300-pound doorman to escort me to the street. ''Put him in a cab,'' she said. ''And make sure he doesn't get shot at this time.''

HEADLINE: Finance Firms Accelerating Their Moves Into China 

BYLINE: By DAVID BARBOZA

DATELINE: BEIJING, Oct. 20 

 BODY:
After years of hesitancy and half-hearted attempts to break into the Chinese market, American and European financial services companies are investing billions of dollars here in the hopes of reaping huge profits from China's rapid economic rise.
 Wall Street firms and some of the world's biggest banks and financial services companies, including Bank of America and American Express, have already invested more than $20 billion over the last three years in joint ventures or strategic stakes in dozens of Chinese banks, brokerage houses and insurance companies.
 With China promising further changes and an opening of its financial markets, some of the world's biggest stock and futures exchanges, including the New York Stock Exchange, Nasdaq and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, are convinced that a growing number of big stock listings and futures or derivatives trading will soon come from the mainland.
 This year alone, Bank of America put $3 billion into the China Construction Bank; a group of investors led by the Royal Bank of Scotland and Merrill Lynch invested $3.1 billion in the Bank of China; a Goldman Sachs-led group is investing $3 billion in the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China; and Temasek Holdings of Singapore has agreed to invest more than $4 billion in two Chinese banks. 
 The accelerated push acknowledges that China has become a focal point of global commerce: it is the world's fastest-growing major economy, and its huge trade surplus and huge foreign currency reserves are solidifying its status as an economic superpower.
 Of course, China's financial markets are still relatively immature. Its banking system is rife with corruption and corporate governance is poor; its stock market is depressed and seemingly broken; its brokerage houses are insolvent; and its managed currency elicits outrage overseas because of trade disputes.
 And yet, there is a growing sense around the world that now is the time to invest or to begin creating a platform to offer financial services products and lay the groundwork for more cross-border deals with the Chinese. 
 ''Everyone's jockeying to get a piece of what they hope is the big growth industry,'' says Jonathan Anderson, chief Asian economist for UBS.
 One indication of the importance of the marketplace here was this week's visits of Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman; John W. Snow, the Treasury secretary; Christopher Cox, the chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission; and Reuben Jeffrey 3d, the chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.
 The delegation of government officials and executives repeatedly referred to the far-reaching changes that have taken place in China. They praised the Chinese government and said they expected further openings as China moves toward becoming a full-fledged market economy. They also met with top leaders, including Prime Minister Wen Jiabao and the head of China's central bank, Zhou Xiaochuan.
 But the American officials also pressed for China to let its currency appreciate further and to lift restrictions on foreign investing in China, like limits on stakes in brokerage firms and banks.
 ''We clearly see the momentum,'' Marc E. Lackritz, president of the Securities Industry Association, said here. ''In the long run, this is the growth opportunity.''
 Underlying the visit of so many high-level American officials is a realization that the American trade deficit is widening, and that, to some degree, purchases of American homes and sport utility vehicles are being partly financed by China, which is using its huge foreign exchange reserves to buy United States Treasury securities, thereby holding down interest rates.
 For years, of course, big banks, insurance companies and Wall Street firms have been coming to China seeking riches. But most have been disappointed by the results. Still, over the last few years, deals like Lenovo's acquisition of the personal computer unit of I.B.M. and the $1 billion cash investment by Yahoo in Alibaba.com, as well as this year's banking rush, suggest that China has turned a corner.
 The list of big investors is growing more impressive. Lately, officials from Citigroup, ABN Amro, Deutsche Bank and BNP Paribas have been prowling China for financial services investments, and committing billions of dollars to new deals. Allianz of Germany and HSBC are moving to enter China's credit card market. The New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq are scouting for new stock listings. And a few weeks ago, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, one of the world's biggest futures and derivatives exchanges, was host of a conference in Shanghai.
 With so much activity, many analysts are warning of a bubble here. They say, often not for attribution, that venture capital firms, banks and others are bidding up the prices of Chinese assets to ridiculous levels and that major companies are putting staggering amounts of cash into risky ventures with suspect books.
 Everyone, they say, is traveling to China these days. And everyone in the financial services world seems to have caught China fever.

HEADLINE: After Two Storms, Cities Confront Economic Peril

BYLINE: By GARY RIVLIN

DATELINE: BATON ROUGE, La., Oct. 21 

 BODY:
In better times, before Hurricane Katrina washed away its tax base, the St. Bernard School District employed 1,200 people. Now, with no money to make its payroll, the district employs fewer than 12 employees, and this weekend, the parish government expects to lay off a large share of its firefighters and emergency personnel.
 Next door in New Orleans, the school district has laid off virtually every employee, more than 7,000 people. The city has laid off half its workforce, and the state university system is preparing for thousands of layoffs and serious cutbacks in services.
After weeks of dealing with the initial shock of the storm and trying to help residents with immediate emergencies, local and state governments around the Gulf Coast are starting to grapple with the staggering size of their financial peril. The disaster that caused so much human misery has also produced what some are calling the worst municipal finance crisis in the nation's history. 
 ''We've never seen anything like this, at least not in our lifetime,'' said Roy Bahl, dean of the Andrew Young School of Policy Studies at Georgia State University in Atlanta and an expert in public finance. ''You think about the hurricanes that hit Florida last year. They were bad. But they didn't devastate the tax base of an entire metropolitan area. They didn't devastate the tax base of an entire region like happened here.''
 Without money, governments cannot run buses so that residents without cars can search for jobs and go to work. They cannot educate the children of families that might try to return. They cannot provide health care, pick up garbage or begin the detailed planning and engineering necessary to bring a city back to life.
 They are locked in a painful loop, unable to lure back exiled residents without services, but unable to provide the services without tax bases. 
 That has become apparent in St. Bernard Parish, the one county in the state that was entirely engulfed in the storm. Officials there have laid off more than half its workforce of 650, including road crews and other essential workers desperately needed for restoration, and by this weekend they might need to slash scores more emergency workers. 
 ''I can't ask people to work another two weeks if I know there's a good chance I'm not going to be able to pay them,'' the emergency preparedness director in the parish, Larry J. Ingargiola, said. ''If you call this weekend and get no answer, you'll know why.''
 St. Bernard and New Orleans are among dozens of cities and parishes around the coast peering into a financial abyss, along with small towns like Waveland and Bay St. Louis, Miss. Hurricanes Katrina and Rita cost southern Louisiana municipalities at least $3.3billion in lost taxes and fees, according to the state legislative office that audits local government books. That does not include $1.5billion in losses on the state level. 
 Local governments, desperately hoping for a bailout from the state and federal governments, have not been pleased by what they have received. The state has its own problems, and the federal assistance so far has strings and payback requirements that many localities consider onerous.
 By statute, the Federal Emergency Management Agency will reimburse government entities 75 cents on the dollar for costs associated with rebuilding and repairs, forcing cities to come up with a 25 percent contribution many cannot afford. 
 Local officials are hoping to persuade federal officials to provide 100 percent reimbursement, as the agency did after the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, and after Hurricane Andrew in 1992.
 ''If we're going to need to pay a match of 25 percent on the cost of Katrina at the same time we have to absorb these lost revenues, frankly I don't know what we're going to do,'' said John Carpenter, director of the fiscal division of the Louisiana House of Representatives. 
 This month, Congress approved legislation to set aside $1billion so governments could borrow cash to help meet operating expenses.
 But many governments said they were frustrated to hear that they would have to repay the money.
 ''We asked for a grant, and what we got was a loan,'' State Treasurer John Neely Kennedy said. 
 Requiring municipalities with wrecked tax bases to pay back the loan, Mr. Kennedy and others said, means that the agencies that most need the money are precisely those that can least afford to take advantage of the program.
 It is also not clear whether Wall Street and big lenders will come to the region's aid. This week, J.P. Morgan Chase extended New Orleans a $150million line of credit to help it make its regular bond payments and pay essential personnel like police officers and firefighters. 
 But the city's credit was marginal before the storm, and bank officials said the credit line was not a normal business decision.
 ''If you look at the typical credit guidelines we use, this probably isn't something we would do, given that the city essentially has little or none of the revenues we usually look for,'' said Donald E. Wilbon, who runs public financing group in the Southeast for the bank. 
 The bank decided to extend the line of credit, Mr. Wilbon said, in part based on its longstanding relationship with the city, where the bank has a strong presence, and on a firm belief that the economy there will eventually rebound. New Orleans typically collected $39million a month in taxes and fees to pay for functions like police, fire and emergency medical services.
 Since the hurricane, the city has collected $2million in revenues, according to Finance Director Reginald Zeno. The bulk of that has been paid by the Harrah's casino downtown, which although it remains closed still has to continue paying its taxes under an agreement with the city.
 The primary revenue source in New Orleans is its sales tax, which pre-hurricane covered about one-third of the operating budget for the city. The tax was a rich and reliable source when the hotels were full and the streets were thick with tourists eager to dine at the myriad restaurants and drink themselves silly. 
 Now about the only people occupying the smattering of open hotels are federal workers, and federal employees are exempt from paying local sales taxes when working on government business. 
 ''We've gone from about $13million a month in sales tax to zero,'' Mr. Zeno said. He gave a long list of other lost revenues like fines from parking and speeding tickets and taxes imposed on utilities that the city cannot expect to see for some time. 
 ''The level of revenue we might see next year is anyone's guess,'' Mr. Zeno said.
 One saving grace is that the demand for services has dramatically fallen. A nearly deserted city means that it will be far less expensive to open schools in the short term.
 The New Orleans district plans on opening eight of its 120 or so schools starting next month, said William V. Roberti, a partner at Alvarez & Marsal, a management firm hired in the spring to run the beleaguered school system. 
 Yet the district, which spent $450million last year, will not save nearly as much money as it might seem at first glance. Even the scaled-down version is scheduled to cost $82million, not including the $32million the district has to pay on bonds and the $80million it has set aside to cover unemployment compensation and employees' health benefits.
 Around half the financing for the district is from the state, but the state has its own budget woes, and districts elsewhere in the state have a claim on some of that money because of the extra students that they absorbed after the huge evacuations in the New Orleans metropolitan region. 
 The city, St. Bernard Parish and school districts have applied for loans from the $1billion federal fund.
 St. Bernard, which relies on nonexistent property taxes, faces a grimmer situation than New Orleans. The parish government has eliminated its road crews, though the byways are in dire need of repair, said Mr. Ingargiola, the parish security director. The parish might also be forced to lay off firefighters and other emergency workers.
 ''Even FEMA people say they've never seen a situation like this where a county or parish is so completely obliterated that we don't even have a safe base of operation to start a recovery,'' said Gary Huettmann, the economic development director for the parish who is working at a borrowed desk in a building across the street from the State Capitol here. 
 The Louisiana State University system, operator of two public hospitals in New Orleans, is laying off 3,000 workers. That number might grow significantly, officials warn, when the system grapples with the possibility of hundreds of millions of dollars in additional cuts, largely because of a precipitous drop in income-tax revenues. Nearly a quarter-million state residents have lost their jobs. Cities are also worried about defaulting on bond payments. New Orleans is directly responsible for repaying $40million in debt. The only reason that it is not late is because there have been no payments due since the storm, Mr. Zeno said. 
 State officials have promised to prevent any city or parish from declaring bankruptcy.

HEADLINE: Leak Prosecutor Is Called Exacting and Apolitical

BYLINE: By SCOTT SHANE and DAVID JOHNSTON

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 19 

 BODY:
In 13 years prosecuting mobsters and terrorists in New York, Patrick J. Fitzgerald earned a public reputation for meticulous preparation, a flawless memory and an easy eloquence. Only his colleagues knew that these orderly achievements emerged from the near-total anarchy of his office, where the relentless Mr. Fitzgerald often slept during big cases.
 ''You'd open a drawer, looking for a pen or Post-it notes, and it would be full of dirty socks,'' recalled Karen Patton Seymour, a former assistant United States attorney who tried a major case with him. ''He was a mess. Food here, clothes there, papers everywhere. But behind all that was a totally organized mind.''
That mind, which has taken on Al Qaeda and the Gambino crime family, is now focused on the most politically volatile case of Mr. Fitzgerald's career. As the special prosecutor who has directed the C.I.A. leak investigation, he is expected to decide within days who, if anyone, will be charged with a crime. 
 To seek indictments against the White House officials caught up in the inquiry would deliver a devastating blow to the Bush administration. To simply walk away after two years of investigation, which included the jailing of a reporter for 85 days for refusing to testify, would invite cries of cover-up and waste.
 Yet Mr. Fitzgerald's past courtroom allies and adversaries say that consideration of political consequences will play no role in his decision.
 ''I don't think the prospect of a firestorm would deter him,'' said J. Gilmore Childers, who worked with Mr. Fitzgerald on high-profile terrorism prosecutions in New York during the 1990s. ''His only calculus is to do the right thing as he sees it.''
 Stanley L. Cohen, a New York lawyer who has defended those accused of terrorism in a half-dozen cases prosecuted by Mr. Fitzgerald, said he never detected the slightest political leanings, only a single-minded dedication to the law.
 ''There's no doubt in my mind that if he's found something, he won't be swayed one way or the other by the politics of it,'' Mr. Cohen said. ''For Pat, there's no such thing as a little crime you can ignore.''
 Mr. Fitzgerald, 44, whose regular job is as the United States attorney in Chicago, is a hard man to pigeonhole. The son of Irish immigrants -- his father, Patrick Sr., was a Manhattan doorman -- he graduated from Amherst College and Harvard Law School. Though he is a workaholic who sends e-mail messages to subordinates at 2 a.m. and has never married, friends say the man they call Fitzie is a hilarious raconteur and great company for beer and baseball. Ruthless in his pursuit of criminals, he once went to considerable trouble to adopt a cat.
 ''He's a prankster and a practical joker,'' said Ms. Seymour, who now practices law in New York, recalling when Mr. Fitzgerald drafted a fake judge's opinion denying a key motion and had it delivered to a colleague. ''But he's also brilliant. When he's trying a complicated case, there's no detail he can't recall.''
 Mr. Fitzgerald was appointed in December 2003 by James B. Comey, then the deputy attorney general and an old friend, to investigate the disclosure in a column by Robert Novak of the identity of an undercover operative for the Central Intelligence Agency, Valerie Wilson, also referred to by her maiden name, Valerie Plame. Her husband, Joseph C. Wilson IV, a former diplomat who had traveled to Niger on behalf of the C.I.A. to check on reports that Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein was seeking uranium there, had publicly accused the White House of twisting the evidence to justify war against Iraq.
 Lawyers involved in the case say Mr. Fitzgerald appears to be examining whether high-level officials who spoke to reporters about the Wilsons sought to mislead prosecutors about their discussions. Those under scrutiny include Karl Rove, the top political adviser to President Bush, and I. Lewis Libby Jr., the chief of staff to Vice President Dick Cheney.
 In grand jury sessions, Mr. Fitzgerald has struck witnesses as polite and exacting. Matthew Cooper, a Time magazine reporter who wrote about his two and half hours of testimony, said that the prosecutor's questions were asked ''in microscopic, excruciating detail.''
 Before he testified, Mr. Cooper recalled that Mr. Fitzgerald counseled him to say what he remembered and no more. ''If I show you a picture of your kindergarten teacher and it really refreshes your memory say so,'' Mr. Cooper wrote, quoting Mr. Fitzgerald. ''If it doesn't, don't say yes just because I show you a photo of you and her sitting together.''
 Judith Miller, the New York Times reporter who wrote about her two grand jury appearances, said that Mr. Fitzgerald asked questions that reflected a deep knowledge of the leak case as he led her through her dealings with Mr. Libby.
 Mr. Fitzgerald has drawn criticism from press advocates for his aggressive pursuit of journalists he believes may have been told about the secret C.I.A. employment of Ms. Wilson. Ms. Miller served nearly three months in jail this summer before agreeing to testify. In pursuing leads that have made him a threat to the White House, Mr. Fitzgerald is following a pattern set by previous special prosecutors. Some allies of the White House complain privately that he has taken on some of the worst traits of his predecessors. Republicans criticized Lawrence E. Walsh for his handling of the Iran-Contra scandal in the Reagan administration, while Democrats attacked Kenneth W. Starr's performance in the Whitewater probe and Monica Lewinsky sex scandal under President Clinton. The two prosecutors operated under the independent counsel law, which both parties let die in 1999.
 Katy J. Harriger, a political scientist at Wake Forest University who has studied special prosecutors, said that Mr. Fitzgerald had some advantages over his predecessors. He has essentially all the powers of the attorney general to chase evidence, question witnesses and seek charges. Unlike Mr. Walsh and Mr. Starr, both former judges, Mr. Fitzgerald is a career prosecutor. And as a Bush administration appointee, he is less vulnerable to attack from the White House. 
 ''It will be much harder than it was with Starr to say this is a partisan prosecution,'' Ms. Harriger said.
 Some attorneys who admire Mr. Fitzgerald detect a hint of zealotry or inflexibility in his approach and wonder whether what works with terrorism translates to an inside-the-Beltway case involving White House officials and their multilayered relationships with journalists.
 In Mr. Fitzgerald's world, a former colleague recalled, it was pretty clear who had black hats and who had white hats, there was not a lot of gray. 
 But Mr. Cohen, whose defense work on behalf of Hamas and other groups has provoked controversy, says he has always found Mr. Fitzgerald willing to listen, and to distinguish between militant rhetoric and genuine terrorist plotting. ''If I need a straight answer from a federal prosecutor, I call Pat,'' Mr. Cohen said.
 Mr. Fitzgerald's moral grounding began at Our Lady Help of Christians school in his native Brooklyn. He attended Regis High School, a Jesuit institution in Manhattan for gifted students, all of whom attend on scholarship. At Amherst, where he majored in math and economics, he was an unassuming kid with a New York accent who was a stellar student, one others frequently turned to for help, recalled Walter Nicholson, an economics professor. 
 At Amherst, he worked part time as a custodian; in the summers during college and law school, his father helped him find work as a doorman. 
 After three years in private practice, he joined the United States attorney'soffice for the southern district of New York and quickly distinguished himself. 
 ''I've tried a lot of cases, and he's probably the toughest adversary I've ever seen,'' said Roger L. Stavis, a New York defense lawyer who faced Mr. Fitzgerald during the 1995 terrorism trial of Sheikh Omar Abdel Rahman. Mr. Stavis prided himself on knowing the web of Muslim extremists but was surprised when Mr. Fitzgerald asked a witness about Osama bin Laden, then an obscure figure. 
 ''I thought, 'I don't know who Osama bin Laden is, but he's in Pat Fitzgerald's crosshairs,' '' Mr. Stavis said. In 2001, Mr. Fitzgerald led the team that convicted four men in the 1998 bombings of two American embassies in East Africa.
 During his time in New York, Mr. Fitzgerald's hapless bachelor ways became legendary. For months he did not bother to have the gas connected to the stove in his Brooklyn apartment. Once, in a fit of domesticity, he baked two pans of lasagna, recalled Amy E. Millard, a New York colleague. Distracted by work, he left them uneaten in the oven for three months before he discovered them, Ms. Millard said. When he tried to adopt a cat, she remembered, he was turned down because of his work habits and only later acquired a pet when a friend in Florida had to give up her cat and had it flown to him to New York. 
 Some of the cases Mr. Fitzgerald handled after moving to Chicago in 2001 have expanded his experience into the sensitive and murky arena of political corruption. He indicted a former governor of Illinois, George Ryan, in a scandal involving the Illinois secretary of state's office, as well as two aides to Mayor Richard Daley on mail-fraud charges.
 But those cases bear little resemblance to the C.I.A. leak investigation, with its potential implications for national politics. Samuel W. Seymour, another former New York prosecutor and Karen's husband, said it is easy to politically ''triangulate'' most government lawyers, noting which were mentored by Democrats or promoted by Republicans. But not Mr. Fitzgerald.
 ''Some people may feel he's independent to a fault, because his independence makes him unpredictable,'' Mr. Seymour said. ''I think it makes him the perfect person for this job.''

HEADLINE: Born of Disaster, Little Park Helps Redeem a Community 

BYLINE: By PATRICIA LEIGH BROWN

DATELINE: OAKLAND, Calif., Oct. 21 

 BODY:
It may be the first park in the country literally inspired by 15 seconds.
 When the Richter scale went jittery for 15 seconds in the Loma Prieta earthquake, the beleaguered West Oakland section here was hit particularly hard. The quake, registering 7.1, caused the collapse of the double-decker Cypress Freeway, killing 42 people and injuring at least 150. It also elicited heroic acts of rescue, with people scaling shaky ladders pieced together with duct tape to free drivers trapped between pancaked sections of concrete. 
 Sixteen years after the event that altered West Oakland, a Quake Memorial Park has opened where the off ramp used to be. The park, designed by April Philips, a landscape architect in Sausalito, is an effort to express emotion in native grasses, wildflowers and stone. 
 But it is also part of a larger effort by the community to redress the ills symbolized by the freeway, which had physically divided West Oakland for decades.
 Built on land donated to the city by the state transportation authority, the one-acre park has undulating grasses that recall how the freeway rippled during the quake. At its ''epicenter'' are metal sculptures of ladders -- symbols of rescue -- twisted like the contorted highway girders that failed to protect. A wall depicts the Richter scale during those fateful 15 seconds, and residents' memories -- ''For a few seconds,'' one reads, ''the earth had turned to jello'' -- are engraved in concrete.
 West Oakland, a predominantly black area of chronically high unemployment with a median household income of $18,000, compared with $62,000 for the Bay Area as a whole, was once the terminus of the transcontinental railroad, a historic hub of the African-American community that was home to Pullman porters and jazz musicians.
 But construction of the freeway in the 1950's destroyed thousands of the area's mostly Victorian houses, many built with redwood from the nearby hills, said Chris Rhomberg, an associate professor of sociology at Yale who is the author of ''No There There: Race, Class and Political Community in Oakland.''
 Along with other projects, including the BART train, which runs below ground in other areas but above ground in West Oakland, the freeway helped push out a lot of the population, Professor Rhomberg said. The Loma Prieta disaster then offered a pivotal moment for the community to ''re-decide its planning future,'' he added.
 A grass-roots effort lobbied successfully against rebuilding the freeway in the middle of West Oakland, making way for the park.
 ''It represents a bifurcated community coming together,'' said David Glover, executive director of the Oakland Citizens Committee for Urban Renewal. 
 ''It's an ironic outcome,'' Mr. Glover added, ''given the tragedy of the earthquake.''
 Amaha Kassa concurs. ''As horrific as the quake was, a lot of people saw the collapse of the Cypress Freeway as divine intervention, giving West Oakland a new chance,'' said Mr. Kassa, executive director of the East Bay Alliance for a Sustainable Economy.
 Among many, memories of the quake run deep. Every Oct. 17, the anniversary, Tim Petersen, who in the years since has become an Oakland firefighter, puts in a call to Mark Fraser, Victor Cuevas and Andy Papp, who are now his colleagues and who rescued him from a wedge of air that day. Mr. Petersen was one of the few survivors from the freeway's bottom deck, which was crushed by the upper deck for more than a mile. His pickup truck was compressed into an 18-inch-thick piece of metal, and he had multiple major injuries, including a broken back. 
 ''We don't talk about it,'' Mr. Petersen, 40, said of himself and those three fellow firefighters. ''But I call them every year just to tell them thanks.''
 The park is part of a broader $11 million landscape design by Caltrans, the state transportation authority, that has turned Mandela Parkway, for years a bleak industrial thoroughfare, into something of a European boulevard, complete with rose bushes and bougainvillea. Before the earthquake, the length of that thoroughfare beneath the freeway was a noisy stretch of blight used to store industrial equipment.
 ''It was everything except what was desirable for the neighborhood,'' said Ellen Wyrick-Parkinson, one of many citizen activists.
 West Oakland has begun to deal with other issues as well, among them the onset of gentrification. Nearby is West End Commons, a new live/work development of $1,800-a-month town houses. There are also upscale-housing plans for the historic Southern Pacific Railroad train station, through which many African-Americans migrated to work in the shipyards during World War II.
 But to many longtime residents, the sight of people actually strolling and biking down Mandela Parkway, bumping into people they know on a Sunday and walking dogs in the park, is a revelation.
 ''It's not just beautiful, but very relaxing,'' Mrs. Wyrick-Parkinson said. ''It just blows my mind, really.''

HEADLINE: Rumsfeld and South Korea Defense Chief Agree to Keep Status Quo

BYLINE: By THOM SHANKER

DATELINE: SEOUL, South Korea, Oct. 21 

 BODY:
Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld and his South Korean counterpart on Friday reaffirmed the commitment of both nations to ''a solid combined defense posture,'' and agreed to ''accelerate discussions'' on whether South Korea should gain command of its military forces in times of war.
 A statement issued after Mr. Rumsfeld's meeting with Defense Minister Yoon Kwang Ung made clear that any changes in wartime control of South Korean military forces, as well as any decision on a shift in America's nuclear guarantee for the South, would be postponed to the future.
Under current agreements, the South Korean armed forces are under South Korean command during peacetime, but fall under American command in the event of war. South Korean leaders have expressed a desire for that agreement to be reviewed, with the goal of gaining full command of their forces in war as well as in peace. 
 At the same time, some political figures here call for a reassessment of the American nuclear umbrella extended over South Korea, arguing that it now may be a hurdle to reaching a final deal to dismantle North Korea's nuclear program. North Korea has demanded an end to American guarantees to protect the South with full force, including the use of nuclear weapons.
 The annual Security Consultative Meeting between the American and South Korean military officials ended in reaffirming the status quo for now on those issues, although both are open to review.
 ''The minister and the secretary agreed to appropriately accelerate discussions on command relations and wartime operational control,'' the joint statement stated.
 Mr. Rumsfeld, speaking at an afternoon news conference, hinted that a shift in the rules of command over South Korean forces in times of war may be inevitable.
 ''As the capabilities of the Republic of Korea grow, obviously they will assume more and more responsibility as they have been doing in recent years,'' Mr. Rumsfeld said. ''As that happens in an orderly way, over time, there will be adjustments in the command relationship and those are the kinds of things allies discuss.''
 The joint statement also ''expressed their hope that the North Korean military threat will diminish gradually through advancements in the six-party talks and efforts in inter-Korean reconciliation and cooperation.'' 
 Both sides noted, however, that North Korea's continued development of nuclear arms or biological and chemical weapons, as well as long-range missiles to deliver them, ''are causes of significant concern'' for the two nations and the international community.
 Secretary Rumsfeld, in the statement, reaffirmed the commitment of the United States to the security of South Korea, ''and to the continued provision of a nuclear umbrella.''
 During his news conference, Mr. Rumsfeld was pressed for a response to recent public opinion polls that indicate a sense among some South Koreans that the United States is a greater threat to peace on the peninsula than North Korea.
 Mr. Rumsfeld took an uncharacteristically long pause, and then reminded his audience of the vibrancy of South Korea's democracy and economy and lifestyle -- and said they had been purchased, to a great extent, by American sacrifice of blood and money.
 ''The United States of America has invested the lives of a great many Americans in helping the Republic of Korea to be free,'' he said. ''We are a part of this alliance at the request of the Republic of Korea's government.''
 Mr. Rumsfeld and Mr. Yoon agreed on the need to maintain American troops in South Korea. Under plans to restructure the American military presence in South Korea, the number of American troops is scheduled to drop from 37,500 to 25,000 by 2008.

Chinese Leader to Visit North Korea
 BEIJING, Oct. 21 (AP) -- President Hu Jintao of China is to visit North Korea next week in response to American appeals for Beijing to do more to convince North Korea stop developing nuclear weapons, China said Friday.
 Mr. Hu's visit on Oct. 28 would be the first by a top Chinese leader to North Korea since 2001. It comes as China is trying to organize for November a new round of the six-nation talks concerning North Korea's nuclear program.

HEADLINE: Industry, Not in Decline

 BODY:

To the Editor:
 ''Proof, Near and Far, That It's Not 1950 Anymore,'' by Floyd Norris (Off the Charts column, Oct. 15), could lead readers to conclude that American industry is in decline. In fact, United States manufacturers last year set records for both production and exports, albeit with far fewer workers than they employed in 1950.
 Manufacturing job loss has been largely driven by a 400 percent gain in productivity since 1950 and is now worsened by high non-wage costs for energy, regulatory compliance, litigation and health care, which handicap us considerably relative to our major industrial competitors.
The skyrocketing price of natural gas in America also threatens many thousands of well-paying jobs, particularly in the chemicals and plastics industries, which use natural gas both for energy and as a feedstock.
 But American manufacturing can enjoy a strong and durable future if policy makers act to reduce the costs of doing business. They can start by allowing the development of our vast energy resources in Alaska and the Outer Continental Shelf.

HEADLINE: Going Where Oil Giants Fear to Tread 

BYLINE: By HEATHER TIMMONS

DATELINE: LONDON, Oct. 21 

 BODY:
The very risk and uncertainty that have made the international oil companies wary of going into Iraq has attracted small, aggressive engineering, drilling and contracting firms to the country. 
 ''Like any market, people will take opportunities where they can,'' said Norman Davidson Kelly, the president of Tigris Petroleum, which is working on two projects in Iraq, including an evaluation of fields in Maysan Province in southeastern Iraq, with Shell and BHP Billiton.
''The fact that the big companies are concerned means that the smaller ones can come in,'' Mr. Kelly said. Tigris Petroleum has half a dozen people in Baghdad who collect data and coordinate with the Iraqis on behalf of the Shell-BHP venture. 
 While Iraq, with the world's third-largest reserves of oil, represents an irresistible opportunity for small companies -- and their interest may help stabilize the country's faltering oil production -- their involvement is not enough, politicians and oil experts say. Without billions of dollars in investment from conglomerates, Iraq seems poised to miss out on what is shaping up as the biggest oil boom in decades. 
 The small companies, some represented in Iraq by just one person, are footing hefty bills for travel and security in the hopes of winning a piece of Iraq's business. Some have signed the first paying contracts with Iraqi officials since the fall of Saddam Hussein's government more than two years ago, though the total dollar amount of the contracts is less than $1 billion, oil specialists say. 
 With attacks on pipelines and workers showing no signs of waning, these modest contracts may be the only business Iraq does with foreigners for some time. 
 Major companies like Shell, Chevron and BP have offered to study oil field data from outside the country, or to send oil ministry employees out of Iraq for training. Security fears, they say, have stopped them from sending in employees from Europe or the United States.
 ''The problems are so overwhelming that people are just not sure how to solve them,'' said an executive from a large oil company, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he hopes to do business in Iraq.
 Oil production in Iraq has declined to less than 2 million barrels a day in August from 2.6 million barrels a day in January 2003, before the American-led military action, and little improvement is expected through next year. 
 The country expects ''refining and production to continue to be constrained through 2005 and 2006, to say the least,'' Thamir Ghadban, the head of the Iraqi oil ministry until January, told industry executives late last month at a conference in London. The industry needs $20 billion in investment over the next five or six years to improve production, he said. Many experts do not anticipate a sizable increase in Iraq's oil output until the end of the decade. 
 Rather than earning money from its oil fields, Iraq is having to spend about $250 million a month to import products like gasoline and is diverting money intended for repairs to increase security. Sabotage, faulty repairs and inadequate oversight and investment in projects are the biggest factors in the production decline. 
 More than half a dozen attacks were carried out in September alone on pipelines, oil ministry buildings and oil wells, and several ministry employees have been killed in recent months. In August, rebels fired a mortar at the oil ministry headquarters in Baghdad. 
 The country's proposed constitution, meanwhile, provides an unclear foundation for investment. It directly addresses only oil that is being extracted from ''current fields,'' which is to be administered by the federal government, not oil that will come from planned fields, or the reserves that specialists predict may be found in areas where planning has not even begun. It is also contradictory, implying that oil will be under federal control in one section and regional control in another. 
 Giving control of oil policy to regional authorities would make the area a less stable place to do business, specialists predict. ''We are going to see weaknesses, and authorities not acting properly in terms of trying to operate or develop the oil fields,'' said Muhammad-Ali Zainy, the senior energy economist for the Center for Global Energy Studies in London. 
 Even with the work of small oil companies, Iraq may lose out entirely on much-needed revenue that could have come from the recent price increases for crude oil, he said. 
 In the last year, little-known companies like Everasia from Turkey, Ironhorse Oil and Gas from Canada and Petrel Resources from Ireland have signed multimillion-dollar contracts to develop fields in Iraq. Others are putting in months of free technical work in anticipation of deals. 
 ''Only very exceptional, quite eccentric people like ourselves are going to work there for the next two years,'' David Horgan, managing director of Petrel Resources, based in Dublin, which signed a $200 million cash contract in September to increase production in two southern oil fields to 200,000 barrels a day from 50,000. 
 ''The oil majors will do studies comfortably from London or California,'' he said, because those executives are not willing to take the same risks. 
 This phenomenon is being repeated elsewhere, as untapped oil reserves are increasingly concentrated in politically risky areas where global oil companies fear to tread, specialists say. 
 ''We're getting a boil up on the fringe,'' said John V. Mitchell, an associate fellow at Chatham House in London, a research firm that specializes in international issues. Small companies ''are expanding in places like Iraq, Nigeria or Angola,'' he said. ''They're prepared to take high risks, and the host government is making space for them.'' 
 The risks are balanced by the possible financial reward. ''For a very small company, if they do well, it transforms them,'' Mr. Mitchell said. 
 Mr. Horgan of Petrel Resources said security risks had substantially increased in Iraq. His company has been working there since before the war and has built up good contacts in the oil ministry, where, at all but the top levels, many executives remain from prewar days. The company encountered its first real problems when it started doing exploration work in the Western desert early in 2004, Mr. Horgan said. Petrel received a letter in calligraphic Arabic that said, ''Anyone who works with the oppressors will be decapitated and burnt,'' he said. The letter ended by apologizing for any inconvenience, he added. 
 Petrel has since stopped sending executives to the western desert to do seismic or geologic evaluations, and does not hire employees from countries in the coalition that invaded in 2003. 
 Asked why they are willing to take such risks, executives from smaller companies emphasize legacy and excitement, but rarely money.
 ''You do not just do it for the money,'' Mr. Horgan said. Instead, he said, he is trying to make sure he has an interesting job.
 ''If I just wanted cash,'' he said, ''I would have gone to Wall Street.''

HEADLINE: A Few Pitches That Come With Fine Print

BYLINE: By DAMON DARLIN. 
E-mail: yourmoney@nytimes.com

 BODY:
Everyday we are cajoled with pitches from marketers who have new ways for us to spend money. Most of them just don't make any sense. A few will. Let's take a look at several that keep popping up.
 The rate for a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage hit 6.09 percent this week, up from 5.64 percent a year ago. The Mortgage Bankers Association reports that the refinancing trend is slowing -- the four-week moving average of its index is down 3 percent -- and such loans account for 42 percent of all mortgage business compared with nearly half in January. 
As the housing market slows even more, expect the hard sell on refinancings. These days, marketers are encouraging you to extract cash out of your house to take advantage of its rising value. But the pitch is often focused on those people who have already tapped their own bank, either in the form of a second mortgage or a home equity line of credit. 

THE SOLUTION? -- How about a new mortgage to take care of all your problems? Here is a typical example of the seductive financing. Your first mortgage is for $160,000 at a rate of 5.75 percent for 30 years. With a rate like that you should be pretty happy now with a monthly payment of interest and principal of $933. But you want to tap into the increased value of your house and take out a second mortgage of 7.5 percent on a 15-year loan. You face an additional monthly payment of $695 for a total payment of $1,628.
 But LendingTree, for instance, would tell you, no, what you should do is take out a new cash-out first mortgage of $235,000 at 6.25 percent. Your payment will be only $1,447, for a savings of $181 a month. You also will be sitting on $75,000 in cash, or slightly less if you had a home equity loan and used the money to pay it off. ''It makes sense for almost everyone,'' says Anthony Hsieh, president of LendingTree.com, a business that connects consumers to mortgage companies. 
 Indeed, Mr. Hsieh is such a believer in consumers blending all their borrowing into one package and looking at the total cost that he is skeptical of the adage that you shouldn't refinance unless rates drop two percentage points below your mortgage. ''You can throw that rule out the window,'' he said. ''It no longer applies.''
 Think this one over long and hard. People no longer consider mortgages as something to be paid off -- remember when people had mortgage-burning parties after they finally got free and clear -- but rather as a financial tool. This is another example of the modern, but nonetheless odd, notion that you should spend more to save, in this case, $514 a month more. 
 Why take on more debt? Ah, you might say, rates are lower now than they will be in a year and my house may be worth more now than it will be a year from now, so the time to act is now. It is odder still that you should go more heavily into debt to save, especially if times may be getting tougher.
 Instead, increase your efforts to pay off the home equity loan the way you would scrimp to pay off credit card debt -- give up smoking, lattes or dinner out several times a week.

CREDIT SCORE AND CREDIT MONITORING -- People who might soon be borrowing should check their credit scores. MyFICO.com provides the scores for $15. You can also get a free credit report once a year from each of the credit monitoring agencies.
 You can also buy credit score and credit monitoring services that will give you daily updates. Such a service can cost as much as $16 a month. Why would you need it? Many of the providers play on your fear of identity theft. Indeed, TrueCredit, a unit of TransUnion, one of the three big credit monitoring agencies, sponsored a study that showed 63 percent of Americans thought they would be victims in the next year. The company used the occasion to feature its 3-Bureau Credit Monitoring product.
 ''We'd like to get people checking their credit for positive reasons, like how you check your cholesterol,'' said Zachary Hastings Hooper, a spokesman for TrueCredit.
 Resist the urge as you would a fat-laden Krispy Kreme. While there are real and frightening cases of identity theft, it happens to only a small percentage of Americans -- 1.5 percent, according to a 2003 Federal Trade Commission survey. And 67 percent of what we call identity theft is just old-fashioned credit card fraud. Credit card companies will protect consumers against most losses when a card is misused. Most credit card companies let you check your card activity on their Web sites -- free. That might be the smarter way to go.
 Some of the services are a bit annoying. A few alert you in an e-mail message when you use the card. And that's the problem: so many alerts arrive that they are easy to ignore.
 But even that won't offer complete protection. If a new account is opened in your name, you will not hear about it for several weeks. That's hardly peace of mind. You'll get the first statement from the new account by that time. 
 In any case, credit scores don't change so quickly that you need to monitor them every day or week, or month, for that matter. You don't check your cholesterol every day. If you did, you'd be a hypochondriac. Why would you want to be a credit hypochondriac?

PINK PRODUCTS -- Limited-edition products have been a very successful fund-raiser for the Breast Cancer Research Foundation, which in the fiscal year ended in June raised $25 million and gave away $22 million to researchers. It and other groups fighting breast cancer, like the Susan G. Komen Breast Cancer Foundation, enlist manufacturers to create special products, usually pink, and ask them to make a corporate contribution.
 Cartier, the luxury goods maker, plays a part in that campaign by marketing a special edition of its women's Roadster watch for the Breast Cancer Research Foundation. The company is producing 800 of the watches with a pink dial decorated with pink ribbons for $3,900 each, the same price as its stainless steel Roadster model. Cartier will contribute $30,000 to the foundation but stands to collect more than $3 million if it sells all the pink Roadsters. 
 It is also worth noting that Cartier spent more on advertising the watch in 10 newspapers across the country than it did on its contribution. 
 ''Whether it is good, that's something we can't answer,'' said Barbara Brenner, executive director for Breast Cancer Action, a group that has been crusading for more accountability in the fund-raising for breast cancer research. ''If they are spending a high multiple on marketing, wouldn't they be better off spending it directly on the fund?'' 
 Anna DeLuca, the research foundation's director for communications, disagrees. She said the Cartier ads, and the advertising of all the other companies that are part of the campaign, promote the foundation and help to raise awareness. ''How great is it for us to get our name out there?'' Ms. DeLuca asked. ''It's a win-win.'' 
 But not necessarily a win for you. You'd be far better off financially by making a tax-deductible charitable donation of $3,800 directly to the foundation. If only seven other people also acted like that, the Breast Cancer Research Foundation would receive more money than it got from the Cartier donation. 

ONE STANDOUT -- Just so you don't think you've found yourself on a forced march through iffy marketing ideas, here's a pitch that sounds fishy, but is not.
 Bank of America is starting a promotion called Keep the Change. It will round up to the nearest dollar every purchase a customer makes on a Bank of America debit card. Then it will transfer the difference between that charge and the actual price of the purchase into the customer's savings account from his or her checking account. The company characterized the promotion as a way to help Americans save, even sticking a big couch in Grand Central Terminal and hiding change under the cushions that commuters were supposed to dig out.
 On a slightly more dignified level, the bank is using David Bach, author of ''The Automatic Millionaire,'' as a spokesman for the campaign. He is advising people to participate in a program that ''helps you save while you spend.'' 
 To show just how serious it is about saving, Bank of America sweetened the deal by promising to match the entire transfers for the first three months and then match 5 percent of each transfer after that up to $250 a year.
 You get a nickel for every dollar you ''save'' by using a debit card that carries no annual fees for its use. Not bad, as long as it doesn't make you buy more. It's hard to find the downside, though consumer groups have disliked debit cards, because they lack the protections against theft that a credit card or even an automated teller machine card carry. But the bank says that if a thief uses your card to empty your account, it puts the money back within 24 hours.
 What does Bank of America get for its generosity? As you might have guessed, it isn't being altruistic, but there is nothing wrong with that. It wants to encourage its existing customers to stop using paper checks, which are expensive to process. The bank charges a 1 percent to 2 percent transfer fee to the merchant accepting a debit card, so processing the electronic transfers of these debit cards isn't quite a loss leader.
 The bank, already the largest debit card issuer with 27 million cards in use, also wants to add customers. The company would not say what its typical customer acquisition costs are or how much this promotion will cost per customer. But giving away less than 2 cents a transaction is no different from a bank's giving away a $200 iPod for opening an account, said Diane Morais, deposits and debits product executive at the company. 
 Bank of America hopes saving can also be music to your ears.

HEADLINE: Punishing Success At Harvard

BYLINE: By JOSEPH NOCERA

 BODY:
THERE is a story -- apocryphal, I suspect -- that Boston-area hedge fund types like to tell about Jack R. Meyer's predecessor as head of the Harvard Management Company. 
 Harvard Management exists to do one thing: manage Harvard's assets. The head of the company in the 1970's and 1980's was a bearish sort who never warmed up to the bull market that began in August 1982. In late 1989, the story goes, Harvard's president, Derek Bok, began scribbling on a yellow notepad during a Harvard Management board meeting. When he was done, he ripped the sheet of paper out of his notepad, put it down in front of the man, and walked out of the room. It was the man's resignation letter.
What brings the story to mind, of course, was the news late last week that Harvard had named a successor to Mr. Meyer. During Mr. Meyer's storied 15-year tenure, Harvard's assets increased from $4.7 billion to $26 billion, with about $22 billion of that its endowment -- making it the largest university endowment in the country. Posting average annual returns of almost 16 percent, Mr. Meyer consistently outperformed not only the market, but virtually every other institutional money manager in the country, with the sole exception of David Swensen, who runs Yale's endowment. Within the world of institutional investors, Mr. Meyer is a legend. 
 So it's not as if the current Harvard president, Lawrence H. Summers, was scribbling out Mr. Meyer's resignation letter. ''Jack Meyer did a great job for Harvard,'' Mr. Summers said the other day. Although Mr. Meyer declined to comment for this column, he has told friends that he was leaving of his own volition; he plans to start -- what else? -- a hedge fund with two Harvard Management fixed-income managers who departed with him. 
 And yet to talk to people in both the Harvard and the Meyer camps, you come away with the feeling that Harvard is not all that terribly sorry to see him go -- and that Mr. Meyer had come to feel that, if he wasn't exactly being pushed out the door, he was certainly not getting the deference or leeway he was used to. At a minimum, his successor, Mohamed A. El-Erian, an emerging markets specialist from the bond powerhouse Pimco, has his work cut out for him repairing the damage that has been done by the quiet rift between a great investor and a great university. 
 THERE are two models for managing endowment money: the Harvard way, and the way everybody else does it. Although virtually all endowments believe in the virtues of asset allocation, most search for talented outside fund managers who specialize in different asset classes, hedge funds very much included, and give them a small portion of the endowment to manage.
 Harvard, by contrast, has historically managed its money itself. Especially in the 1990's, Harvard Management under Mr. Meyer had the feel of a big-time hedge fund, with a handful of its own talented fund managers who knew all of Wall Street's tricks. They employed complex derivative strategies, sold stocks short, searched for arbitrage opportunities, used leverage to bolster returns, and so on. They were a tight-knit group who operated out of an office in downtown Boston, several miles from the Harvard campus. They saw themselves not as Harvard employees but as Harvard Management employees.
 Except they were Harvard employees, which created a problem. As a nonprofit, Harvard is required by law to publicly identify its most highly paid employees each year. Invariably, Jack Meyer's fund managers were at the top of the list. 
 In 2003, for instance, Maurice Samuels and David Mittleman, the two fund managers who are departing with Mr. Meyer, made $35.1 million and $34.1 million, respectively. (Mr. Meyer was paid in the millions as well, but not nearly as much as his top performers.) This in turn created an annual firestorm, led by a small group of alumni from the class of 1969. Their leader, William Strauss, believes that it's unseemly for Harvard employees to make that kind of money. ''This is a nonprofit university,'' he told me recently. ''It's just inappropriate.''
 Just about everybody in hedge fund land takes exactly the opposite view and thinks that the criticism is the height of foolishness. They point out, for starters, that Mr. Meyer saves the university money. After all, outside hedge fund managers who turn in investment performances like that of Mr. Mittleman and Mr. Samuels make far more than $35 million. 
 In addition, the compensation system Mr. Meyer set up included an extraordinary provision. When a fund manager outperformed his benchmark, he received only a certain percentage of his bonus. The rest was carried forward. If the fund manager beat his benchmark the next year, he got the rest of his ''carry forward.'' But if he underperformed, he would have to give part -- or all -- of it back.
 ''I think Jack's compensation system was right on,'' said Scott C. Malpass, who manages Notre Dame's endowment, which has its own stellar record. ''The incentives were aligned.'' That's what fund managers at Harvard Management believed as well.
 Over the last half-dozen years, two things happened that began to change Harvard Management. First, the old gang broke up, as many of Mr. Meyer's proteges left to open their own hedge funds. Instead of replacing them, Mr. Meyer put Harvard endowment money in their funds, in amounts that started at $500 million. In return, he got special breaks for Harvard Management. 
 As a result, today about half of Harvard's money is managed by outside fund managers, though, of course, they are exactly the same people who once managed it internally. But now, the newspapers don't report their compensation.
 And the second change? That would be the arrival, in 2001, of Mr. Summers, the former Treasury secretary, as president of Harvard. One of the raps on Mr. Summers is that he always has to be the smartest guy in any room, tossing off questions he means to be provocative, but which often have the effect of alienating the people he's questioning. 
 And so, at Harvard Management board meetings, Mr. Summers began questioning Mr. Meyer about everything from the positions in the portfolio to its level of risk. In addition, Mr. Summers's old boss, the former Treasury secretary Robert E. Rubin, became a fellow of the Harvard Corporation -- the equivalent of a regent -- and he began asking Mr. Meyer even tougher questions. (Mr. Rubin did not return my phone call.) For Mr. Meyer, the questioning felt like meddling, even if it wasn't meant that way.
 But here was the real blow. For the last year or so, Harvard Management has been using a different compensation system -- one that Mr. Summers strongly backed and the Harvard Management board approved. The carry-forward provision was eliminated. The compensation at the low end was raised. But at the high end, the pay for overachievers like Mr. Mittleman and Mr. Samuels was capped at somewhere between $20 million and $25 million. 
 It would be hard to imagine a more politically boneheaded move. On the one hand, a $20 million paycheck is still far too high to mollify the class of '69 critics. On the other hand, it was a crushing blow to the fund managers still left, who felt that Mr. Summers was running roughshod over Mr. Meyer's incentive system. I don't believe that Mr. Summers imposed the new system as a means of getting rid of Mr. Meyer -- he simply thought it made more sense for a university endowment -- but that was the inevitable result. Mr. Meyer must have thought: who needs the hassle?
 So where does that leave Mr. El-Erian? He is replacing a legend with a performance record that will be nearly impossible to match. Much of the talent at Harvard Management is gone, and those who remain are demoralized. Although Mr. El-Erian is viewed as a brilliant bond guy, he has no experience dealing with hedge funds. Indeed, should he decide that the Harvard model no longer works, and wants to farm out more of the endowment, he will be starting from scratch. Unlike other universities, Harvard doesn't have the expertise to evaluate outside hedge fund managers -- except Mr. Meyer's former Harvard Management colleagues.
 When I spoke to him late last week, Mr. El-Erian sounded both aware of the challenges he faces, and undaunted. He insisted Harvard would continue to manage its own money. ''A lot of hedge funds simply exploit inefficiencies,'' he told me. ''If you can do that more cheaply on the inside, you should.''
 He liked the idea, he said, of connecting the management company more closely to the university, tapping into its brainpower for investing ideas and assistance. He noted that in the current difficult investing environment, returns were likely to be lower than they had been, that he would have to do a fair amount of ''institutional rebuilding,'' and that he would be living, to some extent, in a ''fishbowl.'' God bless him, he seemed pretty excited about the whole thing.
 Bill Gross, the bond guru who has been Mr. El-Erian's boss at Pimco, told me that Mr. El-Erian was indefatigable, trustworthy, a great manager, a savvy investor and ''very politically astute.'' From the looks of things, he's going to need all of those qualities.

HEADLINE: Reinventing the Mill

BYLINE: By EDUARDO PORTER

 BODY:
James Roberts is understandably bitter about the realignment of America's steel industry. ''It's hardly fair; hardly right,'' said Mr. Roberts, a 68-year-old retiree from the Bethlehem Steel plant in Steelton, Pa., who lost his health care coverage and a third of his pension as the company sank into bankruptcy.
 But for Jerry Ernest, a 54-year-old maintenance technician at the former Bethlehem plant in Sparrows Point, Md., the company's bankruptcy, reorganization and re-emergence this year as part of the global giant Mittal Steel was not quite as bad a deal. The money is better; so is the pension. ''I'm in my golden period,'' Mr. Ernest said. ''I'm doing better at this mill than I've ever done.''
What was once Bethlehem Steel is more competitive now than it has been in a long while. Flailing under the onslaught of cheap foreign steel just four years ago, today it has consolidated into a larger company with a leaner work force and more pricing power. 
 To arrive at this stage, however, the work force at Bethlehem's plants was trimmed to some 8,200, down from 11,500 three years ago. More important, Bethlehem had to cast off many of its roughly 70,000 retirees. 
 In doing so, it abandoned the part of industrial America's social contract that implied that if workers gave the company decades of hot and dirty factory work, the company would, in return, provide generously for them in old age.
 ''It doesn't help anybody to have a gold-plated contract in a failing company,'' said Wilbur L. Ross Jr., the financier who bought Bethlehem Steel in 2003, strung it together with four other bankrupt mills, overhauled their operations and sold them to Mittal.
 ''Steel is a cyclical industry, so you need a cost structure with which you can survive in periods of low demand,'' Mr. Ross said. ''I believe we have achieved that.''
 Today, other industrial behemoths like General Motors and Delphi, the giant auto parts supplier that just filed for bankruptcy, are similarly flailing as they take aim at the ''legacy costs'' of retiree health care and pensions. The gyrations of the steel industry provide a road map of how they might reconfigure their industrial relations.
 The revamping of Delphi in bankruptcy ''will put the unions in the difficult position of perhaps having to make trade-offs between maximizing the pay and benefits of active workers versus maximizing the chances for saving these pension plans,'' Robert S. Miller Jr., Delphi's new chief executive, said in a meeting with reporters and editors at The New York Times.
 Mr. Miller speaks from experience. In 2001, he was the chief executive who led Bethlehem Steel into bankruptcy. 
 Just three years ago, most of America's integrated steel mills had either gone under or were on their way there. On the losing end of a long battle against cheaper steel made by foreign producers and the low-cost domestic mini-mills, the giant steel mills around the Great Lakes began shedding large numbers of workers in the 1970's. 
 Under relentless pressure, the industry transformed itself. In 1980 steel companies employed about 400,000 American workers and it took about nine hours of labor to produce a ton of steel; by last year, the work force had withered to some 120,000 workers but it took each of them only about two hours to make a ton of steel. 
 The surge in productivity also had a cost, however. Early retirement was always the favored tool to ease workers off the payroll. As layoffs continued from one decade to the next, the number of retirees grew rapidly. By the end of the 1990's there were about three retirees -- drawing pension and health benefits -- for each active worker, nearly triple the ratio for other major basic manufacturing companies. 
 Then, the steel industry was hit by a double whammy. Another flood of foreign steel ate deeply into the market share of domestic producers and steel prices plunged as demand for the material in Asia and other developing economies plummeted after the string of financial crises that coursed through the Far East.
 Health care costs were already rising at a rapid clip. But the devastating blow was delivered by the stock market. When the dot-com bubble burst, it took a big portion of the assets of corporate America's pension plans with it, leaving them with billions of dollars worth of unfunded liabilities. 
 By 2002, the payroll at Bethlehem, the former titan whose steel was used to build the Golden Gate Bridge, the Empire State Building and the Holland Tunnel, had fallen to 12,000 workers supporting around 130,000 retirees and dependents. 
 The company was already sagging under the cost of its retirees' health care plan, which had dug a hole of $3 billion into the balance sheet. From November 1999 to 2002, the assets of Bethlehem's pension plan shrank to $3.7 billion from $6.1 billion, according to government filings. The pension plan's obligations, on the other hand, grew to $6.6 billion. 
 Bethlehem was among more than 40 steel companies that went bankrupt from 1997 to last year. Many made it out, mostly overhauled and consolidated into one of three megacompanies: Mittal, Nucor and U.S. Steel. 
 While revampings were complex, and involved different combinations of concessions from their workers, two main components stood out: shedding retiree medical benefits and unloading the retirement plans onto the government's Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation.
 Two dozen failing steel companies moved the pension plans for a quarter of a million workers and retirees to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation from 2001 to 2003, dropping into the government's lap a long-term payment gap of about $10 billion. The United Steelworkers of America estimated that 208,000 retirees and dependents lost their health care benefits. Bethlehem accounted for nearly half. 
 Robert W. Crandall, an economist at the Brookings Institution who is an expert on industrial organizations, argues that there is a significant parallel between the troubles afflicting industries like automobiles and airlines and those that undid big steel: they set the template for their labor relations when they faced very little competition. 
 For decades, American car companies and steel mills, facing little competition from outside the established oligopolies in each industry, were able to provide generous wages and benefits, raising prices to cover the immediate costs but deferring much of the impact by promising generous retirement benefits far into the foggy future. 
 Unfortunately, those deferred costs started showing up in recent years just as fierce new competitors emerged -- be they Japanese auto transplants, Korean steel manufacturers or nonunion, scrap-burning mini-mills in the American South and West. 
 Take General Motors, which has about 2.5 retirees for every one of its 142,000 active workers in the United States. While the company pension plan is in relatively good shape, health care is another matter: the company is paying about $6 billion a year to provide health coverage to its workers and retirees; the retiree health plan is sinking under $77 billion in projected liabilities covered by merely $16 billion in assets. 
 Had G.M., the biggest of the Big Three automakers, managed to keep the 45 percent share of the American car market it had 25 years ago instead of its present 25 percent, these costs might not have been a problem. But wilting under the onslaught of more appealing cars made by Toyota, Honda and others, it could not bear the cost: this week G.M. and the auto workers union agreed to trim about $1 billion of G.M.'s annual health care expense, mainly by making retirees pay health care premiums. 
 What will the overhaul of labor costs do to labor relations at America's big companies? As the dust lifts on steel's reorganization, the remaining work force, while radically smaller, does not seem to be in such a bad position. The International Steel Group, the new company into which Mr. Ross folded his steel acquisitions, reached an agreement with the steelworkers union that its workers hail as an improvement over the old.
 ''The big thing is that people are making more money now than they ever made,'' said Joe Rosel, a maintenance worker and union representative at the former Bethlehem Steel plant in Sparrows Point. ''The companies are making money. That's a big thing.''
 Hourly wages will rise $1.39 to $1.90 by September 2008 and bonuses have increased, too, under a new profit-sharing plan. Bethlehem's byzantine system of job classifications was also streamlined. Layers of management were eliminated, giving workers much more autonomy to do their jobs.
 Mr. Rosel said that though the company's work force was trimmed by about a third, everyone who left did so voluntarily under a buyout plan that offered $50,000 a worker. And though workers remaining on the payroll will lose a chunk of the pension benefits they had accrued at Bethlehem, union officials say the new union-managed pension plan is much better than Bethlehem's.
 On the other hand, the treatment of retirees has left a bitter taste. 
 ''There's plenty of blame to go around here and none of it is the workers','' said Mr. Roberts, who retired from the Steelton plant in 2000, after 32 years of service. ''They had no control over what was going on.''
 Many retirees lost portions of their pensions when the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation took them over, especially the youngest batch. Mr. Roberts, for instance, lost more than $600 from his $1,875 check -- forcing him to get another job at a school cafeteria last year to supplement his income. 
 Of the 100,000 Bethlehem retirees and dependents who lost their health care plan, about a quarter are under 65, too young to qualify for Medicare. While the International Steel Group agreed to contribute $50 million and a portion of each year's operating profit to a fund for retiree health care, the pot has only enough to cover prescription drugs and nothing else. 
 And it is still uncertain whether the industry can survive over the long term, even in its current leaner, no-retiree form. Astronomical demand for steel from China lifted prices sky high last year, providing steel companies with their best profits in years. 
 But steel prices have slipped this year. As China and other developing countries continue building steel plants, workers and executives worry about what would happen if China's economic growth were to waver and its demand for steel to wane. 
 Louis Schorsch, the chief executive of Mittal Steel USA, notes that labor-management relations are better than they have been in a long time. ''The union has recognized that the old way of doing business doesn't work,'' Mr. Schorsch said. ''We shouldn't talk about how to carve the pie but about how to make this industry more competitive.''
 The new labor peace is probably a product of the industry's better fortune. Given its cyclical nature, its fortunes will eventually turn down again. Then, the new labor relations will undergo their first real test. 
 And that could bring a fresh quandary to the fore that the industry and the union may simply be incapable of resolving without outside help from the government: ''Workers who work their whole life,'' said Leo Gerard, the steelworker union's president, ''should not have to choose between a decent retirement, a decent paycheck and decent health care.''

 The American steel industry has been shedding workers since the 1970's.

HEADLINE: Unending Housing Boom Tosses Aside Rate Increases and the Old Rules

BYLINE: By Floyd Norris

 BODY:
THE housing boom in the United States has survived 11 rate increases by the Federal Reserve. Lately it has faced jawboning from Fed officials who warn bankers not to ease lending standards too far and caution homeowners that, as one Fed governor, Donald L. Kohn, said this week, ''a substantial slowing in the pace of house-price appreciation seems inevitable.''
 But on the same day that Mr. Kohn pointed to ''scattered and mostly anecdotal'' signs that the housing market was cooling, the Commerce Department reported that builders started 183,000 homes in September, notwithstanding the impact of Hurricane Katrina. That was more than expected, and made the month the strongest September in three decades. 
Housing has been in a prolonged boom. The total number of housing starts is not unprecedented; it is in fact lower than the peak reached in late 1972, when a boom was nearing an end that would be worsened by a totally unexpected rise in oil prices. But what is unprecedented is the mild nature of booms and busts in the housing market. 
 It used to be common to see start volume rise and fall by huge percentages. In the spring of 1975, with a deep recession ending, the number of houses started over the previous 12 months was off 37 percent from the figure of a year earlier. In the fall of 1983, as the economy emerged from recession, housing starts were 66 percent above where they had been a year earlier. But in the last decade, the annual gains or losses in housing starts have never exceeded 14 percent.
 What is different now? One factor is the way houses are financed. It used to be that banks and savings and loan associations made mortgage loans, and they would be cut off when the Fed pushed up interest rates above the levels the banks could pay on savings. But those rules are long gone, and the Fed cannot turn the housing market on or off.
 Indeed, as the current boom shows, the Fed has some trouble even slowing a boom. Long-term interest rates have not risen with the short-term rates the Fed does control, and the financial system has responded with creative mortgages that let homebuyers hold down monthly payments even as the purchase price rises.
 Although overall housing starts remain lower than their peak in the early 1970's, that is in part a result of the changing nature of the housing market. When overall starts hit a record in 1972, 44 percent of the starts were in apartments and other multifamily buildings. The latest figures show just 17 percent of the starts in multifamily units. Single-family homes are being built at the fastest pace ever.
 With the Fed worried about speculative excesses in housing, it would dearly love to slow the boom without bringing on a bust reminiscent of the old days. Builders know what the Fed is saying, but so far they believe that customers will keep lining up to buy whatever they build.

HEADLINE: Cutbacks, Bankruptcy and Growing Inflation Signs 

BYLINE: By Mark A. Stein

 BODY:
UNALLOYED good news was in short supply this week. Automakers finally made progress in paring their uncompetitive labor costs, but they still posted huge losses for the last quarter and had little by way of encouragement about their prospects for the future. Sizable layoffs and plant closings are likely early next year, they said, and workers who keep their jobs will have to pay more for their health care.
 Many big companies said this week that their earnings in the last quarter were better than expected, but many also warned that profits were not likely to grow as fast in the coming months. Inflation, meanwhile, is accelerating, while other economic statistics suggest growth may be slowing. 
For good measure, another financial services company filed for bankruptcy court protection amid an accounting scandal -- just two months after it sold shares to the public.

SHRINKING BENEFITS -- Squeezed by declining sales of highly profitable sport utility vehicles, General Motors got the United Automobile Workers union to agree to cuts in health care benefits for more than 750,000 blue-collar workers, retirees and their families. The changes are expected to save about $1 billion a year.
 The news came on the same day that G.M., the world's largest automaker, said it lost $1.6 billion in the third quarter. It was the company's largest quarterly loss in more than a decade, and brings total losses so far this year to nearly $4 billion. To shore up its finances, G.M. said it would sell a majority stake in its most reliably profitable business, the General Motors Acceptance Corporation, the financial services unit.
 By agreeing to reopen its contract before it expired in 2007, the U.A.W. has opened the way for Ford and the Chrysler division of DaimlerChrysler to seek similar cuts in the health care benefits for their hourly workers.
 Ford reported a third-quarter loss of $284 million this week and said it planned ''significant'' plant closings and layoffs in January. G.M. said it might accelerate plans to cut 25,000 American blue-collar jobs, which it had previously said it would do by the end of 2008.
 Some analysts said similar cuts in health care benefits and perhaps even pensions could come soon in other heavily unionized industries, including telecommunications, that face increased competition from abroad or from new technologies.

A GIANT TUMBLES -- Refco Inc., the giant commodities and futures brokerage firm that was poleaxed by news that it may have concealed more than $400 million in bad debts before selling stock to the public two months ago, filed for bankruptcy protection. It was the fourth-largest bankruptcy filing in United States history.
 The move came a week after Refco put its chief executive, Phillip R. Bennett, on leave as it investigated the role he played in the accounting irregularities. Michael J. Garcia, the United States attorney in Manhattan, has charged Mr. Bennett with securities fraud. Mr. Bennett says he is not guilty.
 Separately, a review of Refco's financial statements showed that insiders at the company received more than $1 billion in the year before the firm sold stock to the public and then quickly sought bankruptcy protection. 
 Amid the tumult, a group of investors led by J. Christopher Flowers, a former Goldman Sachs partner who runs a private equity fund, signed an initial agreement to buy Refco's futures brokerage business for $768 million. The Interactive Brokers Group weighed in a few days later with a higher bid. 
 Competitors are preparing to woo Refco clients who are nervous about the company's future. Refco had about 200,000 accounts before the scandal broke.

SEESAW ECONOMY -- Unexpectedly robust earnings at some of the country's biggest companies, including I.B.M., Motorola and Charles Schwab, were not enough to offset disappointment over statistics suggesting that inflation is accelerating just as the economy may be slowing.
 Wholesale prices rose 1.9 percent last month, the biggest one-month jump in 15 years. That suggests that last week's news of a spike in consumer prices -- they rose 1.2 percent in September, the biggest monthly jump in 25 years -- may be repeated in months to come.
 Higher prices could come just as the economy is braking. The Conference Board, a private research group, said that its index of leading economic indicators fell 0.7 percent in September. That decline, the third consecutive monthly drop, was worse than the 0.5 percent contraction that economists had forecast. First-time jobless claims fell, but less than expected.
 Several widely watched economic statistics, including consumer confidence, home sales, durable-goods orders and initial unemployment claims, are due next week. They may provide a clearer picture of where the economy is headed.

UP IN SMOKE -- The Supreme Court gutted the federal government's campaign against the tobacco industry by refusing to hear an appeal of a decision that sharply limited the monetary damages the government can seek even if it can show in court that the industry has been run as a ''racketeering enterprise'' that falsely promoted its product as harmless.
 In a civil lawsuit filed in 1999 and concluded last June after nine months of arguments, the government sought to recoup $280 billion from the industry. That was the government's estimate of the amount of ill-gotten gains tobacco companies made from the statements at issue.
 While the trial was proceeding, a panel of the federal appeals court in Washington looked at whether the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, the law known as Rico that is the basis for the lawsuit, permits the government to force tobacco companies to disgorge any illegally obtained proceeds. The appeals court concluded that the law does not allow that.
 Judge Gladys Kessler of Federal District Court is expected to rule in the coming months on the case and, if she finds the tobacco companies liable, on what relief the government should get.

GUILTY PLEA -- Serono, a Swiss biotechnology company, agreed to pay more than $700 million to settle federal charges that it illegally marketed a $21,000 AIDS treatment that most patients did not need. The case involved Serostim, a drug to treat extreme weight loss by AIDS patients. By the time Serono patented it in 1996, other drugs had sharply curbed that condition. Serono pressed ahead with a marketing strategy that offered free travel to doctors who prescribed the drug anyway. One prosecutor said that 85 percent of the prescriptions were unnecessary.
 Four former Serono executives have been indicted in the case and face trial on criminal charges of false claims against the government. Two other people who worked on the sales and manufacturing of Serono's products have already pleaded guilty.

HEADLINE: Reinsdorf's Little Secret: Even Enemies Like Him

BYLINE: By MURRAY CHASS

DATELINE: CHICAGO 

 BODY:
BORN and raised in Brooklyn, he has called himself ''the luckiest Jew alive,'' but he officiates at weddings as an ordained minister of the Universal Life Church. He has led owners in attempts to drive a stake into the heart of the union, but there are player agents who swear love and devotion to him. He led the movement that ousted Fay Vincent as commissioner in 1992, but even Vincent speaks highly of him. 
 And then there is George Steinbrenner, about whom Jerry Reinsdorf once said: ''How do you know when George is lying? When you see his lips move.'' Steinbrenner, however, loves the guy (''He talked of him fondly,'' Howard Rubenstein, Steinbrenner's spokesman, said). Everybody seems to love Reinsdorf, who is approaching 70, and everybody is delighted that Reinsdorf, the chairman of the Chicago White Sox, is finally in the World Series. 
''Jerry Reinsdorf works very hard to have the public completely misunderstand him,'' said Steve Greenberg, managing director at the investment bank Allen & Company and a former deputy commissioner of Major League Baseball. Greenberg, who has also been an agent, has known Reinsdorf for nearly 25 years and has always liked him.
 ''He's a guy I have an affinity for,'' Greenberg said. ''I can't help myself. People say, 'Don't admit you're a friend of Jerry Reinsdorf,' but I can't help it.'' 
 And discussing the private Reinsdorf, Greenberg added: ''Jerry is a very, very sentimental guy. This is a side he hates to have get out because he has a reputation to uphold.''
 The sentimental side of Reinsdorf is apparently what led him to the Web site at which he learned he could become an ordained, nondenominational minister.
 Despite his new calling, Reinsdorf still devotes more time to his baseball team and finally, after 25 years of trying, has got it right. Maybe he has been able to devote more time to his primary function, given the absence of internal wars to fight, whether with the union or with commissioners.
 ''He doesn't like commissioners,'' Vincent said. ''He once said to me: 'Don't take it personally. I don't like David Stern, and I don't like you.' He said commissioners don't have money invested in the sport. 
 ''I respect him because he's very bright. I think he's very committed to his franchises.''
 Vincent used the plural because Reinsdorf is also chairman of the Chicago Bulls, who, with Michael Jordan leading the way, won six National Basketball Association titles. Reinsdorf has been quoted as saying that he would trade his six N.B.A. championship rings for one World Series ring.
 Reinsdorf did not respond to an interview request, so the various charges of niceness will go unchallenged. There were more.
 ''Jerry's a tough guy when he's in a battle,'' said Tom Reich, a longtime agent and Reinsdorf friend. ''He's a very kind guy on a personal level. His public personality is different from his private personality. On one hand, he's one of the smartest, toughest guys going. On the other hand he's one of the funniest, kindest guys going.''
 Ed Farmer, a former pitcher and a current White Sox broadcaster, told yesterday about how Reinsdorf had chartered an extra plane to take White Sox employees to the games in Houston next week. He related a more intimate story as well.
 ''He's paying a fellow's salary who passed away six years ago,'' Farmer said. ''He's still paying his widow because her husband was part of the organization. As long as she's alive, she's going to get a check.''
 Steinbrenner and other owners have been equally generous, but no one has matched Reinsdorf's lead in hiring members of minorities for top-level positions. Two examples: 
 In the two years after Major League Baseball retired Jackie Robinson's uniform number in 1997, baseball and its teams filled 19 openings for managers and high-ranking front-office positions. Only one opening was filled by a minority, Jerry Manuel, whom the White Sox hired to be their manager.
 Until the Mets hired Omar Minaya and Willie Randolph a year ago, the White Sox were the only team with minorities as general manager (Ken Williams) and manager (Ozzie Guillen). Some fans became disenchanted with Reinsdorf in 1994, seeing his militant negotiating stance as a key reason for the players' strike. And fans were livid in 1997 when, at the trading deadline, with the team only three and a half games from first place, the White Sox traded their closer and two starters to San Francisco, wrecking whatever chance they might have had for first place. (Reinsdorf thought they had none.)
 Reinsdorf angered his fellow owners in 1996 when, despite his strong views against big salaries, he signed Albert Belle to a five-year, $55 million contract.
 He angered players when an arbitrator found in 1988 that he had been intimately involved in the owners' collusion against free agents. ''When it comes to the economics of baseball, there's no question he's been a hawk and is a hawk,'' Reich said. ''But I don't think that meant that he didn't want to win. His excitement right now is undeniable.''
 So, apparently, is the respect he gets from both friends and enemies.

HEADLINE: Placements In Foster Care Are at Lowest Since Mid-80's

BYLINE: By FERNANDA SANTOS

 BODY:
The number of New York City children in foster care has dropped to roughly 18,000 -- half what it was just six years ago, and a total that approaches levels not seen since the mid-1980's, when crack cocaine began to sweep through local streets and tear thousands of families apart.
 City officials and other experts say that the decline has been driven by a number of forces: a healthy economy, a radical falloff in the use of a highly destructive drug, and a shift in local child welfare policy, which now seeks to keep children in their own homes whenever possible.
''It's a historic change,'' said David Tobis, executive director of the Fund for Social Change, a private organization that tracks child welfare trends nationwide. ''What happened in New York is extraordinary. There's a lot that needs to be changed, and the city recognizes it, but you can't deny that the continuous drop in foster children is terrific -- and the city is doing that while helping families stay together.'' 
 Indeed, interviews with government officials, independent experts and lawyers who work in the Family Court system reflect widespread agreement that the city has made great strides in preserving families by offering parents a host of services -- counseling, housing aid, food stamps, drug treatment -- to help avert further abuse.
 In 1991, the city's foster care population reached a record high of 49,100 -- a figure reflecting the consequences of the crack epidemic, but also the way the child welfare agency counted children in care -- and generally has been in decline since then. Still, as recently as 1999, the number of children in the custody of the state stood at 35,200.
 Some experts and officials caution that the steep declines of recent years is cause for concern. They question whether the push to keep families together might be leaving children in harm's way, and worry that there is not an adequate supply of preventive services -- counseling and drug treatment -- for all the families at risk.
 Moreover, they raise the possibility that the closing of any number of foster care agencies as the overall population shrinks might leave the city vulnerable in the event of another crisis.
 ''I see the changes with cautious optimism,'' said Lauren Shapiro, director of the family law unit at South Brooklyn Legal Services, which represents parents whose children have been placed in foster care. ''Where the gap is now is that the preventive services are not enough, and what's out there is not comprehensive enough.''
 City officials, however, are quick to assert that investigators with the Administration for Children's Services are trained better than ever to accurately assess a child's needs and less likely to miss any warning signs. What is more, when families are kept together, the city saves millions of dollars.
 Under the Bloomberg administration, the money saved by the city's child welfare agency through the reductions in the number of children in foster care -- an estimated $27 million in the fiscal year that began in July -- will be put back into the system in large part to finance the services that help families stay together while under agency supervision.
 ''It's not that we won't need more money as we go along, but this plan allows us to start moving toward fulfilling the current needs of the system,'' said John B. Mattingly, the agency's commissioner. ''The goal is to reach a balance, to have an agency that is putting its money, and the right amount of money, in the right programs.'' 
 New York City's foster care population has undergone drastic changes in the past 25 years, but none as profound as those sparked by the beating death of 6-year-old Elisa Izquierdo by her mother in 1995. The girl had repeatedly come to the attention of child-welfare workers, but they missed the warning signs.
 The unprecedented public pressure that followed compelled the Giuliani administration to hire a former prosecutor, Nicholas Scoppetta, himself a product of foster homes, to fix the system. Mr. Scoppetta's tenure was initially characterized by aggressive enforcement: from 1996 to 1998, nearly 35,000 children were removed from their homes and placed in foster care. In 1999, however, that number began to go down because, Mr. Scoppetta said, officials slowly recognized that child safety could be better served by preventing the trauma of foster care placement in the first place.
 ''There is always a debate as to whether you're a family preservation agency or a child protective agency, but I think that misses the point,'' Mr. Scoppetta, now the city's fire commissioner, said in an interview. ''It's about assessment, and the whole perspective is that if a child can be safe at home, you should leave that child at home.''
 The agency under Mr. Scoppetta's leadership is generally credited with hiring more people, increasing salaries, improving training and establishing a computerized evaluation system to track the quality of its foster care services. It also adopted the recommendations of a panel of national experts brought in by court order to evaluate the foster care system.
 Under Mr. Scoppetta's successor, William C. Bell, the number of admissions into the foster care system dropped to 6,200 in 2003, his last year in the agency, from a record high of 12,000 in 1998.
 Meanwhile, agency officials assert, only 8 percent of the children left in their homes after reports of abuse or neglect were maltreated within a year of the first accusations. Moreover, the overall number of complaints of abuse has declined by 52 percent over the last seven years -- an indication, some experts say, that the city has managed to keep families together without compromising children's safety.
 ''The new approach of keeping families together is just as effective at treating the disease -- i.e., child abuse -- without nearly as many side effects -- i.e., the trauma of separation,'' said Richard Wexler, executive director of the National Coalition for Child Protection Reform, a private group in Alexandria, Va.
 ''There is no system in the country that has succeeded going the other way, favoring removal over preservation,'' Mr. Wexler said. ''New York City tried going the other way first, and it didn't work. It's clear the panic didn't make children safer.'' 
 Nationwide, other cities and states with troubled child welfare systems have also moved away from removing children as the first option, and their foster care populations have also slowly begun to decline.
 The principal reason for reduction of the nation's foster care population is that welfare agencies have been able to significantly increase the number of children discharged from foster care, often through adoption, according to Wade Horn, the assistant secretary for children and families at the federal Department of Health and Human Services.
 For New York, the next step, Mr. Mattingly said, is to develop a partnership between the agency and community-based organizations that would allow the city to mobilize a network of foster parents at a moment's notice should crisis spark a sudden increase in demand. 
 The partnership, which is still in its planning phase, would also allow these organizations to invest in programs and services that are most needed to protect children and preserve families in their neighborhoods.
 ''What we hope to be able to do is to offer neighborhoods flexible funding so that they can spend the money on these families and their children the way they think is best,'' Mr. Mattingly said.

CORRECTION-DATE: October 26, 2005

 CORRECTION:
An article on Sunday about a sharp decline in the number of foster home placements in New York City referred incorrectly to a corresponding pattern of child abuse complaints. What dropped by 52 percent over the last seven years was the number of substantiated complaints -- not the overall number of complaints, which has remained steady near 50,000 a year, according to the State Office of Children and Family Services.

HEADLINE: Once It Was Direct To Video, Now It's Direct to the Web 

BYLINE: By JOHN ANDERSON. 
John Anderson is co-author of the forthcoming ''I Wake Up Screening: What to Do When You've Made That Movie.''

 BODY:
IT was a late night in Seattle. It was probably raining. Scilla Andreen was still haunting the offices of her as-yet-to-be-started Internet movie company, IndieFlix, when the phone rang. It was -- no surprise -- a young filmmaker.
 ''He thought we were a local production company,'' said Ms. Andreen, 43, a filmmaker herself, as well as an Emmy-nominated costume designer. ''Or a distribution company that might buy his film.''
 What the young fellow had found in his efforts to support his movie -- which he'd financed by selling his late grandmother's ring -- wasn't a distribution company, not in the traditional sense, but instead, the latest wrinkle in the dissemination of independent film. 
 As cheaper technology and a seemingly inexhaustible hipness quotient have led to more filmmakers and films being produced, theatrical distribution has become more expensive, the outlets more cautious, and the returns on investments more dubious. The Internet has absorbed some of the spillover, although the bigger success stories -- notably, the political films of Robert Greenwald (''Uncovered: The War on Iraq,'' ''Outfoxed: Rupert Murdoch's War on Journalism''), or ''Faster,'' a highly lucrative motorcycle documentary narrated by Ewan McGregor -- have been niche movies with a core audience. 
 So what about more general fare with no stars, budgets or hope? That's where IndieFlix, founded by Ms. Andreen and her business partner, the filmmaker Gian-Carlo Scandiuzzi, comes in. Directors submit their films, which are then posted on the Web site (www.indieflix.com). When users log on and click to buy the films that capture their interest, IndieFlix burns them onto a DVD and ships them out. The price for a feature-length film is $9.95.
 Ms. Andreen's motto: ''Own a movie for less than a movie ticket.''
 At a time when audiences are ebbing, piracy is threatening profits and at-home downloading takes gas mileage out of the movie-going equation, a company that helps filmmakers and audiences find each other on the Internet may be as natural a step in the evolution of cinema as portable DVD players or reserved seats. It may also be as close to a no-risk deal as filmmakers are likely to find: all they need provide is proof that the rights to their film have been cleared, and a master to be copied. And unlike traditional or even online distribution deals, the filmmakers retain all the rights. 
 IndieFlix represents ''a platform to present their work to an audience that under normal circumstances wouldn't be available to them,'' said the actress Whoopi Goldberg, who is on the company's advisory board. ''As one who works inside and outside the system, I've come to understand the distribution is a key component. And from a purely economical standpoint, if there's a way for folks to participate'' it would be ''a win-win for everybody involved.'' But Peter Broderick, president of the Los Angeles-based Paradigm Consulting and a longtime adviser to distributors and filmmakers, cautioned that price really doesn't have much to do, he said, with the attraction of buyers to on-line indie films.
 ''It's apples and oranges,'' he said. ''If you have a film that has a core audience, it doesn't matter if it's $9.95 or $29.95. If your movie is about something that matters to people, they'll buy it. Just as you can't compare Tom Cruise and 'War of the Worlds' to what somebody buys online.''
 And to many filmmakers, success online will always be a very far cry from success in the theaters. ''That's our art -- and we think it needs to be bigger than life, on the screen, the group experience in the dark,'' said Ms. Andreen. ''All filmmakers want that.''
 ''That's the weird thing about filmmakers,'' she added. ''It just repeats itself. It doesn't evolve. So we just said, 'It's time to evolve.'''
 She speaks from experience. ''First and foremost, we're filmmakers,'' she said. ''Carlo has made more movies than I have.'' They have made two films together, including the feature ''Outpatient,'' and several shorts. The ''game'' as she calls it, is the same ''whether you're making art or schlock.''
 They made what they called ''artful'' movies that got good reviews, and several awards, and grand jury prizes ''and we had distribution offers from Artisan and Lions Gate and various other name companies and realized that the terms were so horrible. They wanted the rights for 20 years; we got them down to 7.'' She said that the terms were so ridiculous ''you'd have to make $10 million before you begin to see a penny, and then they still wanted you to go out and do this grassroots campaign and marketing and publicity for our own movies, even after we had to do all that other stuff. And that was a good deal.''
 They opted instead to raise the money themselves, on the Web. They were following the model of Bob Berney -- the man who orchestrated the unorthodox distribution strategies of ''My Big Fat Greek Wedding,'' ''Memento'' and ''The Last Temptation of Christ.'' Now at Picturehouse, Mr. Berney approves of their innovation. ''Considering how difficult it is to do it on your own, either theatrically or on DVD, it's a good idea,'' he said. ''If you're at that stage where you haven't gotten any interest -- and no one believes you when you say, 'If only people had a chance to see my film, they'd love it If only people knew ' -- IndieFlix is like 'No more excuses.'''
 It also takes the shelf-space argument out of retail DVD sales, he said, because the major retailers only have room for very little other than the blockbusters. 
 ''But the other question,'' he said, of IndieFlix, ''is: how are people going to hear about it?'' 
 A recent weekend found Ms. Andreen in an Indian casino in Temecula, Calif., at the Temecula Valley International Film & Music Festival, where IndieFlix was awarding cash prizes -- something the company had also done on Long Island at last summer's at the Stony Brook Film Festival at the State University -- to the audience-choice award winners. A thousand dollars for a feature, $500 for the documentary, $250 for shorts. 
 ''It's not a lot,'' Mr. Scandiuzzi acknowledged. ''We can't do very much. I mean, I know that TriBeCa is doing something like that, and much bigger, but they have millions of dollars from American Express. It's more about the gesture.'' 
 That gesture, however, can count for a lot. IndieFlix may be the movie director's version of the Last Chance Saloon. ''We might be the last stop on the track,'' said Ms. Andreen, ''but our goal is that eventually filmmakers will go out with their little mini-DVD cams and make a movie for practically nothing, specifically to sell it on Indieflix because it costs them nothing. And we give them the publicity tools, the marketing tools and we make it for them, and deliver it in a timely manner.'' 
 ''We feel every film has an audience'' she added. 
 ''I have reached a point in my life where my main focus has shifted to wanting to give something back to the community. I'm not rolling in dough. I'm not famous. And I have so many kids'' -- six, including 6-year-old twins -- ''that I don't exactly have a lot of spare time. As filmmakers, Carlo and I had become so frustrated with the limitations of standard distribution and disheartened with the way it squelches creativity. So, after much thought and careful planning, we started IndieFlix and suddenly it felt like the shackles came off.'' 
 ''It's also good,'' she added, ''to see other companies sprouting up that offer a similar deal. It validates what we are doing and how quickly the world is changing.''

HEADLINE: If You Don't Eat or Drive, Inflation's No Problem

BYLINE: By DANIEL GROSS. 
Daniel Gross writes the ''Moneybox'' column for Slate.com.

 BODY:
ASIDE from the stuff that's becoming more expensive, like food and energy, there is no problem with inflation in the economy. That's the message economists want us to take from recent inflation reports.
 On Oct. 14, the Bureau of Labor Statistics said the Consumer Price Index, the main inflation gauge, rose by a whopping 1.2 percent in September and by 4.7 percent in the last 12 months. The bureau also said the Producer Price Index, which measures inflation experienced by businesses, rose 1.9 percent in September alone. 
Amid these alarming reports, many economists urged Americans to remain calm and to focus on the so-called core C.P.I. -- the inflation measure that excludes the volatile costs of energy and food. The core rate rose just 0.1 percent in September, and is up only 2 percent in the last 12 months. 
 The dueling numbers seem to offer a classic case of how economists and consumers view the world differently. If only we lived in some futuristic biosphere where we didn't need energy or food, inflation wouldn't matter. 
 Government economists have been stripping out energy and food costs from the price gauge for more than three decades. After the Arab oil embargo of 1973, Arthur Burns, who was then the chairman of the Federal Reserve, correctly reasoned that temporary shifts in the price of oil shouldn't influence monetary policy unduly. So he asked Fed economists to show him a measure of price changes that excluded energy costs. Later, he asked for one that also excluded food costs. 
 Steven Roach, chief economist at Morgan Stanley, was an economist at the Fed at the time. ''When we were asked to strip out some of the most important things that people buy, my reaction was, 'You've got to be nuts,''' he said. ''These are the vital necessities of life.''
 But Mr. Roach, like most other economists, has come to see the virtues of distinguishing between the so-called headline C.P.I. and the core C.P.I.
 Prices of food and energy are notoriously volatile, and susceptible to supply shocks and acts of nature. Inflation in these vital sectors doesn't necessarily indicate inflation across the economy. Mr. Roach notes that in the last year, consumer energy prices have risen 35 percent, while prices of other goods and services are up just 2 percent.
 Economists also say the utility of the inflation measure depends on the question you are trying to answer. ''If you want to know how much more it costs you to live this year than last year, look at the headline C.P.I.,'' said Ann L. Owen, associate professor of economics at Hamilton College in Clinton, N.Y., and a former economist at the Federal Reserve. ''And from a consumer's perspective, there's nothing good about a 4.7 percent increase in headline inflation in 12 months.''
 Economists at the Fed aren't obsessed with short-term pocketbook issues like high oil prices -- and not just because many of them commute to work in Washington on the Metro. Rather, they focus on long-term economywide issues.
 ''You want to make sure that short-term monetary policy isn't responding to a phenomenon that is just going to go away in a few months, or even a year,'' said Stephen G. Cecchetti, economics professor at Brandeis University. ''A change in an interest rate today will have an effect on inflation one to two years from today.'' We would not have wanted the Fed to act as if the post-Katrina spike in gasoline prices were permanent, he noted.
 What's more, the Fed tends to focus on things that it can control. Not even a Fed chairman as powerful as Alan Greenspan can affect the price of oil by manipulating interest rates. ''There's nothing the central bank can do about that, unless it figures out how to produce more oil,'' said Michael F. Bryan, vice president and economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland.
 But the Fed can control the amount of money circulating in the economy relative to the quantity of goods available. ''So it tries to find the inflation signal common to all prices throughout the economy,'' Mr. Bryan said. 
 Thus considered, the core C.P.I. may be the best tool the Fed has to monitor long-term changes in prices.
 Still, economists see two good reasons not to ignore the headline number today. First, inflation in a crucial category like energy can worm its way into the entire system. ''If high energy costs persist, and if they continue to rise, they may ultimately seep into the core,'' Professor Owen said. The second reason has less to do with hard economic realities than with softer perceptions. The cost of gasoline is the economy's most visible price. People see it every day even if they don't buy gas every day, said Matthew Martin, senior economist at Economy.com. And most people buy food every week. 
 ''If prices for those two things go up quickly, consumers will form the impression that inflation is high,'' he said. ''And if consumers begin to expect more inflation, they might be more tolerant of price increases.'' 
 If that happens, the headline C.P.I. number could dominate the headlines.

HEADLINE: Disappearance Still Weighs On Aruba's Tourism

BYLINE: By AMY GUNDERSON

 BODY:
IN early September, during a seven-night vacation to Aruba, Lisa and Dan Masciantonio, from Upton, Mass., thought that they would see signs of the investigation into the disappearance of the Alabama teenager Natalee Holloway, a case that dominated the cable-news programs throughout the summer. ''I expected that I would see posters and ribbons tied around trees, but it seemed to us business as usual,'' Ms. Masciantonio said.
 Despite the apparent absence of missing-person flyers plastered with photos of Ms. Holloway, 18, who vanished on a senior class trip to the island in May, the case is still on the minds of Arubans who have fought to prop up tourism under calls for boycotts of the island. ''They are very concerned about what happened, and it is not just over concerns about tourism,'' Ms. Masciantonio said. ''They just think it is an awful event.'' 
 Ms. Masciantonio said she spoke to many residents during her stay at Marriott's Surf Club in the Palm Beach area. ''Are we going to punish an entire island for the actions of a few?'' she said.
 The nonstop news coverage also generated concern among tourism officials, travel agents and hotel operators that travel to the southern Caribbean destination, which relies on the United States for two-thirds of its business, would suffer a hit. Even as news media coverage subsided, calls for a boycott, most recently from the syndicated talk show host Dr. Phil McGraw in mid-September, continue. But so far travel agents have reported few cancellations, steady bookings and higher prices for accommodations. 
 ''The economy of the United States, oil prices and such will have more impact on any tourism economy than this isolated case,'' said Myrna Jansen, the managing director of the Aruba Tourism Authority, responding to questions in an e-mail message. Tourism operators were ''extremely disheartened'' by any call for a boycott, Ms. Jansen said. ''As far as we know, economic boycotts are called against countries that develop nuclear weapons, not against countries who are friends of the United States.''
 On an island known for ideal windsurfing conditions, multiple casinos and a location that puts it out of the path of most hurricanes, the disappearance of Ms. Holloway and the subsequent handling of the case by Aruban authorities seem to have barely dented tourism. 
 ''Initially, we did not see a blip on the screen,'' said Jeff Lesker, the general manager of the Radisson Aruba Resort and Casino. ''People who were booked for July and August were reluctant to cancel.'' Mr. Lesker points to big gains in tourism from June 2003 through June of this year, a trend that he admits has started to change. ''There is less appetite for booking,'' he said, although he suspects that energy costs in the United State are having a bigger impact than the missing-person case. MCM Tours, an Aruba-only travel agent based in Hackettstown, N.J., had no cancellations this summer. ''We thought we would see an effect,'' said the vice president, Phil Gemore. But the longer- term impact, if any, isn't yet clear. ''We'll know better in January 2006, when everyone starts booking again,'' he said.
 Susan Biemans, the sales and marketing manager of the 104-room Bucuti Beach Resort in Eagle Beach, has also seen little fallout. She points to recent occupancy rates of 94 to 96 percent and strong bookings that have the resort nearly sold out from Christmas to Easter, when the rates range from $285 to $440 a night. Rates for next summer are increasing up to $40 a night, depending on the accommodation, over this summer's. 
 Despite the stronger business, Ms. Biemans said the number of questions she received from travel agents and customers concerned her. ''They're doubting everything they've heard about the island over the years,'' said Ms. Biemans. ''The good news is that they can be put at ease.'' 
 Gail Malec, owner of Dream Destinations Travel in Carol Stream, Ill., which specializes in destination weddings, received similar inquiries from some of her clients. ''If it was their first time going there, they would ask me if I thought it was safe to go,'' said Ms. Malec, who has three Aruba weddings in the planning stages. And Judy Rawls, the owner of Great Escapes Travel in Audubon, N.J., noted a negligible impact on business. ''We've only had one mother actually who was trying to talk her two daughters and their two friends into taking a cruise rather than going to an island,'' she said.
 Tourism officials are baffled not only by the case but also by calls to boycott the island. ''Never could I have imagined that this could happen to Aruba,'' said Marcial Ibarra, the director of business development for the Aruba Hotel and Tourism Association. ''We put all our effort into tourism. We live for tourism and have nothing else.'' 
 In early September, Aruba's tourism suffered another blow when it lost one of its top attractions, a 100-foot-long natural coral rock bridge suspended 25 feet above the ocean on the north side of the island. When Mr. Ibarra heard that the bridge collapsed, he said he initially thought: ''What have we done wrong? Are we getting punished?''
 But despite the setbacks, the travel industry is still looking at the island as a growth area. In July, Continental Airlines announced that it would start weekly nonstop flights from La Guardia airport in New York in mid-December. Travel agents are buzzing about the December opening of the Occidental Grand Aruba, which closed in May for an overhaul. And the Ritz-Carlton is looking at the island for a future property, although Vivian Deuschl, a spokeswoman for the chain, says that no plans have been confirmed. 
 And for those planning trips to the island, the case has been far from a deterrent. Margaret Stumpp, for instance, goes to Aruba every year for the prime windsurfing conditions in December. ''Frankly, those things are unfortunate, but they can happen anywhere,'' said Ms. Stumpp, referring to the Holloway case. ''I've always felt that it was a safe island to visit.'' Apparently other travelers feel the same way. In early October, Ms. Stumpp was having trouble booking accommodations at the 13-room Boardwalk, where she usually stays during her December visits. 
 Meanwhile, the limelight surrounding the case is starting to fade. Lynn Dates, an Atlanta resident who spent five days in Aruba in September, said the disappearance was still a topic of conversation among travelers -- but not the dominant topic. ''As I was floating around the pool, it was probably the third thing we talked about after restaurant suggestions,'' Ms. Dates said.

HEADLINE: The Benefits of the Boom 

BYLINE: By DENNIS HEVESI

 BODY:
IT seems counterintuitive, but the luxury real estate market is helping to build housing for low- and moderate-income people.
 Sometimes, the deals create what could be called sibling buildings -- for example, a 42-story luxury tower on West 43rd Street is linked to five renovated tenement buildings nine blocks to the north. It was a good deal for both.
The beige-brick luxury building, called the Ivy Tower, is seven stories taller than it would have been had its developers not agreed to help finance the gut rehabilitation of those century-old buildings at the northwest corner of 52nd Street and 10th Avenue -- creating 27 apartments for lower-income people.
 The developers of the Ivy Tower benefited by getting 42 additional units, with rents ranging from $1,850 for a studio to $6,500 for a penthouse. 
 But the tenants on 52nd Street, where the five dilapidated tenements were combined and thoroughly modernized, also revel in their good fortune. ''This is like luxury, so beautiful,'' said Sister Kathleen Cox, one of four nuns who live together in a three-bedroom apartment in the once-condemned buildings. Rents in the rehabbed building range from $297 a month for a studio to $947 for a three-bedroom. 
 The tradeoff linking the Ivy Tower to Sister Kathleen's relatively sumptuous quarters was made possible through what is known as inclusionary zoning, one of several city programs that provide incentives for market-rate developers to contribute to the inventory of affordable housing. They can buy extra space for their buildings from affordable housing developers; include affordable apartments in their buildings; or buy city-issued certificates from developers of affordable housing that allow them to pay lower property taxes.
 ''The traditional equation,'' said Shaun Donovan, the commissioner of the Department of Housing Preservation and Development, ''has been that the stronger the real estate market, the harder it is to provide affordable housing. These programs turn that old equation on its head because the stronger the market, the greater the incentive for developers to use these programs and, therefore, provide affordable housing.''
 As housing economists point out, the market-driven programs do not meet the city's great need for the production of affordable units -- but they make a dent. And their impact is expected to increase in the next few years as builders, aware of the city's growing population, take advantage of recently enhanced incentives to build in rezoned areas like the Hudson Yards and West Chelsea in Manhattan, and Greenpoint and Williamsburg in Brooklyn.
 But for Sister Kathleen and her roommates, Sisters Joan Kirby, Margaret Coakley and Judy Garson -- all members of the Religious of the Sacred Heart -- the impact of those incentives is already deeply felt.
 Three years ago, the nuns were evicted from a tenement building on West 49th Street because a fifth nun, the one whose name was on the lease, had moved into a retirement home near Albany. They used to pay $1,284 for the railroad flat in the old building, with its bathtub in the kitchen, toilet in the hallway, no lock on the front door and rarely seen superintendent. 
 Now, at $337 a month less, they are in a rehabbed building with a corniced roof and arched terra cotta windows. ''It's day and night,'' Sister Margaret said. ''We have sunlight, fresh air; we have the garden outside. There's doors on the closets, doors on our rooms.'' 
 Sister Joan said, ''Here, if any little nick in the floor comes, a tile comes loose, the super fixes it immediately.''
 Sister Kathleen says she appreciates ''the variety of families in the building; we're elderly, and we just had a little baby down the hall.'' To which Sister Margaret added, ''Just on this floor, we have four different countries.''
 Under the program that linked the two buildings, developers can build an extra four square feet of market-rate space for every square foot of affordable space that is created. If the affordable project is done off-site, it must be within the same community-board area or within half a mile of where the market-rate development is being constructed. Part of the concept is to foster mixed-income communities.
 The rehabilitation of the 52nd Street building retained the early 1900's exterior of the five tenements with a thoroughly modernized interior. ''It went from walk-ups to elevator,'' said Joe Restuccia, executive director of the Clinton Housing Development Company, which, along with another affordable housing company, L&M Equities, developed the project. ''It has 27 apartments, a community garden.'' 
 The renovated building has more than 25,000 square feet of space. That generated more than 100,000 square feet of extra development space, which was eventually divided among three luxury developers who helped finance the renovation. The largest share, 45,186 square feet, was sold to the builders of the Ivy Tower.
 Mr. Restuccia appreciates the opportunity to make such deals. ''Few other cities have the incredibly dynamic real estate market we have where there's such a spread between the market rents and the affordable housing rents,'' he said. ''So, because market-rate units bring in so much rental income, the projects have the ability to support a greater number of affordable units.''
 And with a lot more for-sale units on the market in recent years, he said, ''The economic return on a condo project easily enables a developer to include an affordable housing component while having greater returns.''
 Bernard Friedman, the president of the Penmark Realty Corporation, a partner in the development of Ivy Tower, savored another sort of return from the link between his building and Mr. Restuccia's affordable project. When he witnessed people who had lived in ramshackle buildings moving into the West 52nd Street building, he recalled, ''some of them had tears in their eyes.'' 
 ''It's a two-way street,'' Mr. Friedman said. ''We are contributing to low-income housing at no expense to the city and we, in turn, get the extra floors on our building.''
 The other luxury developers that participated along with Penmark Realty were the Brodsky Organization and the Steinberg & Pokoik Management Corporation.
 Adrienne Brockington has no notion of the intricacies of another city program that allows luxury developers to profit by supporting low-income housing: the 421-a tax abatement program. But she is glad to be living in a new development -- with high porches, lawns and walkways -- on Loring Avenue in East New York, Brooklyn. Rents there range from $525 a month for a studio to $646 for a two-bedroom.
 ''It looks like down South, like in Virginia,'' Ms. Brockington said. ''It's gated, with security. It has grass in the complex'' -- a far cry from the rough street in Bushwick where she lived for eight years, until 2002.
 The 187 apartments in three-story town houses at 1426 Loring Avenue were developed by the Arker Companies, which has built more than 3,000 affordable rental units in Brooklyn, the Bronx and Manhattan, in large part by selling 421-a certificates. 
 Under the program, a developer of affordable housing can sell the city-issued certificates to developers of new luxury buildings -- primarily those between 96th Street and Houston Street in Manhattan -- providing a 10-year property tax abatement on the market-rate building. The current negotiable rate for 421-a certificates is about $13,000 for each luxury apartment. The stronger the luxury market -- meaning the greater the value of a new building -- the higher its property taxes will be; and, therefore, the greater the benefit in buying a tax abatement. So, if a developer is selling condominiums with reduced property taxes, buyers will be able to afford higher purchase prices because their tax bills will be lower.
 Sol Arker, a principal of the family-owned company, said that about 930 certificates were sold to help finance the construction of 1426 Loring Avenue. The 421-a program ''is only one component in the city's efforts to meet the housing needs of lower-income people,'' Mr. Arker said. ''I don't believe there's one silver bullet that produces all of the affordable housing needed, but it significantly helps.''
 It certainly helped Ms. Brockington. 
 ''I'm on disability because I had a stroke two years ago,'' said Ms. Brockington, 40, the mother of two daughters -- one 18, the other 18 months old -- who recently also took custody of her 15-year-old grandniece. Ms. Brockington, who is in a program that teaches computer skills, was one of the applicants picked in a lottery run by the Department of Housing Preservation and Development to live in the Loring Avenue development. Her old neighborhood, she said, ''was drug-infested; there were shootouts all the time.''
 A total of 4,271 affordable units have been created through the inclusionary and 421-a programs. ''It's sort of Robin Hood,'' said Adam Weinstein, president of Phipps Houses, a nonprofit affordable housing group that owns or manages about 13,000 apartments in Manhattan, Queens and the Bronx. ''It's taking the enormous value in a strong market and transferring -- cream skimming, in effect -- some of that value for social good: affordable housing,'' he said.
 For example, Mr. Weinstein said his organization holds ''an extremely valuable piece of real estate'' on East 25th Street -- an underused playground that is part of a 400-unit affordable development built 30 years ago -- that will become the site of 50 more affordable apartments. 
 Michael D. Lappin, president and chief executive of the Community Preservation Corporation, another major nonprofit housing group, said his organization had invested nearly $5 billion preserving or developing 120,000 units of affordable housing. 
 More is on the way. Mr. Lappin said deals are being considered by churches in central Brooklyn that ''flourished in one era and now have a lot of underutilized property'' -- rectories or schools. If they build affordable housing on their property and finance it by selling air rights, they will also help their members. ''Their angst was that their congregants were being priced out of their neighborhoods, at $1,500 to rent a two-bedroom in a brownstone,'' he said. 
 Mr. Donovan, the city's housing commissioner, said mixed-income communities are the right model for the future. With the inclusionary program, he said, ''we're essentially creating new neighborhoods from the ground up.''
 He expects that 30,000 units will be built in the next few years in the recently rezoned areas of Brooklyn and on Manhattan's West Side. ''Using our new inclusionary program, which is the most aggressive in the country, along with city-owned land and other incentives,'' he said, ''we expect 8,500 of those units to be affordable.''
 But more will certainly be needed, said George W. McCarthy, a housing economist at the Ford Foundation. Calling himself ''a big fan of inclusionary zoning and 421-a incentives,'' Dr. McCarthy said, ''While these market-based programs are laudable, they are still insufficient to meet the growing needs of New York City's low- and moderate-income families.'' 
 For those who have benefited, the changes have been enormous. David Lopez, a New York City police detective, and his wife, Janet, a waitress, and their 11-year-old son, David Jr., live in the rehabbed West 52nd Street building where the four nuns also reside. They were allowed to move in after another tenement they had been living in, on West 37th Street, was closed for renovations. The Lopezes pay $840 a month for a two-bedroom. 
 A 24-story luxury building is rising next door. ''This area is up and coming; new apartments, new buildings,'' the detective said. On the open market, ''I'd definitely have a hard time finding something like this in Manhattan,'' he said. 

Getting on the Lists For Affordable Housing
 THE city's Department of Housing Preservation and Development supervises separate lotteries for each affordable housing project. Advertisements for projects are placed in community newspapers, in citywide dailies and on the department's Web site, www.nyc.gov/hpd.
 The department's home page includes a ''For Apartment Seekers'' section, with a directory called Current Housing Lotteries. The directory lists all apartments currently available under inclusionary zoning, the 421-a tax-exemption program and all other housing programs. The department gives preference for the sale or rental of half the homes it helps create or rehabilitate to current residents of the community board district where the homes are located. 
 The listings specify the income-eligibility requirements, which vary from project to project. For example, the annual income requirement for new tenants at the five tenement buildings on West 52nd Street ranged from $30,470 for a one-person household to $43,520 for a household of four people. 
 Someone seeking an apartment must request an application and return it by a specified date. No application or broker fees are charged, although the developer may charge for an applicant's credit report. Those chosen in the lottery must go through a series of interviews. 
 In general, the lotteries receive far more applications than the number of homes available. DENNIS HEVESI

HEADLINE: A 'Sucker' Seeks an Even Break

BYLINE: By WILLIAM NEUMAN

 BODY:
THERE are many signs that could signal the end of a speculative bubble: increased market volatility, shifts in economic fundamentals, galloping investor euphoria. And then there is David Denby. 
 Mr. Denby, a film critic for The New Yorker, was looking for a quick killing in early 2000 when he jumped into the stock market -- just as the technology boom was peaking. He then watched his portfolio fizzle as boom turned to bust, a process he chronicled in his book ''American Sucker'' (Little, Brown, 2004).
Now Mr. Denby has entered the Manhattan real estate market, putting his two-bedroom apartment on West 72nd Street up for sale for $1.1 million. Hmmm. Kind of makes you wonder, doesn't it? 
 But maybe real estate will be kinder to Mr. Denby than stocks were. 
 Mr. Denby's stock market travails had a real estate angle as well. He got into the market in the hopes of making enough money to buy out his ex-wife's share of their marital apartment, on West End Avenue, after they broke up. But his stock picking led only to ruin and the couple finally sold the unit in mid-2003 for $1.5 million, Mr. Denby said. 
 He said that they paid about $460,000 for the apartment in the mid-1980's. 
 After bowing to the inevitable, Mr. Denby bought himself the two-bedroom, 1,100-square-foot co-op on West 72nd Street, at the lower end of Riverside Park. He paid $617,000 in early 2003. ''It was a wreck,'' he said. ''It hadn't been touched for 45 years.''
 Mr. Denby spent about $140,000 to gut it and fix it up, putting in a new kitchen and plenty of built-in bookcases. ''It's a kind of writer's paradise,'' he said. ''It's light, it's quiet, there's a lot of book space, and music space.''
 He lived there with his son, Thomas, who went off to college this fall, and then just over a year ago he was married again, to Susan Rieger, an associate provost of Columbia University. Now, they are looking for a larger place to share, and Mr. Denby has put his apartment up for sale. He has listed the apartment with Sherry Matays, a senior vice president with the Corcoran Group.
 But he no longer dreams of instant riches. 
 ''I'm cured of my stock mania,'' Mr. Denby said. ''I'm very conservative these days. But this is not about investment. This is about finding a place large enough for two grown-ups, settled in their ways, where sons and daughters can visit.'' 
 He added: ''All New York stories become real estate stories.'' 

The New Real Estate Math
 HOW much does combining two apartments add to the sale price? A banker and his wife on Park Avenue are betting that it adds a lot. 
 Brendan Dillon, an executive with UBS, and his wife, Eva, bought an eight-room apartment on the fifth floor of 655 Park Avenue, at 68th Street, several years ago. The building is a co-op and city records do not show the sale price, but it was on the market for $2.1 million in April 2000, according to listing data shared by real estate brokerage firms. Then, last July, city records show, the Dillons closed on the apartment directly below theirs. It had been listed for $3.7 million with Eileen N. Mintz, a broker at the Corcoran Group. 
 Ms. Mintz said that the building requires all apartments to be offered internally to other residents before they hit the open market and that the Dillons had taken advantage of this provision to buy the unit directly from the previous owner. Because there was no broker's fee, it is likely that they paid less than the listed price. 
 Now, without doing the work to join the two apartments, the Dillons have put them up for sale together for $15 million -- making the theoretical whole worth more than double the sum of the parts. 
 The apartments together could be configured into a duplex with five bedrooms, a library, a formal dining room, a media room, an eat-in kitchen and ''ample staff quarters,'' according to the listing, posted online by Elizabeth Lee Sample and Brenda Powers of Brown Harris Stevens. Each apartment has a working fireplace.
 ''It's very hard to find that kind of space in a prewar building uptown, and families really want big spaces today,'' Ms. Sample said. 
 In addition to listing the two apartments together, the Dillons have listed the fourth-floor unit on its own for $4.85 million -- at least $1 million more than they paid for it three months ago. Melinda Ely Dubow, a Corcoran agent, shares the listings. 
 Mr. Dillon declined to discuss his real estate dealings. 
 The building, which dates from the 1920's, has an unusual layout for Park Avenue. It occupies the full block between 67th and 68th Streets and is built in a C-shape around a central courtyard garden.

A Bursting Bubble? Never Mind.
 THE bubble has popped! Long live the bubble!
 Much was made in recent weeks of brokerage and appraisal reports that the average price of a Manhattan apartment had tumbled in the third quarter, suggesting that the real estate market had reached a turning point. But averages can be deceiving, and data on closed sales in September suggests other interpretations. A new report on the Manhattan market by Halstead Property shows that the average price of an apartment -- excluding lofts -- fell considerably in July and then rose in both August and September. 
 ''Everybody's saying it's starting to get bad, but August and September were better than July, so how's it getting worse?'' said Gregory J. Heym, vice president and chief economist for Halstead. ''It's not a way to prove that there isn't a market decline, but it certainly has to put into question that the market is getting worse.''
 The Halstead report shows that the average apartment price fell to $1.115 million in July from a high of $1.33 million last June. It then rose to $1.145 million in August and $1.187 million in September. The median price -- the point where half the apartments sold for more and half sold for less -- also fell, to $725,000 in July and August from a high of $831,250 in June, then rose again to $749,000 in September. 
 The report was based on 667 co-op and condo sales that closed during the month. The average price in September was 12 percent higher than the previous September and the median was 15 percent higher than the sales figures from the same month a year ago. 
 A report by Brown Harris Stevens evaluating 2,380 sales in the third quarter, also produced by Mr. Heym, was released earlier this month, showing that the average apartment price had dropped 10.8 percent from the previous quarter, although it was still higher than the third quarter average a year earlier. Data from other brokerage firms showed similar declines. 
 Along with other signs of a slowdown, including reports of increased apartment inventory and apartments taking longer to sell, the drop in the average price led some observers to predict an end to the boom market of the last few years. But the average largely reflected a decrease in the number of very high-end properties that had closed in the quarter (for instance, Rupert Murdoch bought a $44 million apartment on Fifth Avenue, and it closed in May). 
 Other segments of the market held their own. One-bedroom apartments made up 43 percent of the third-quarter market, according to the Brown Harris survey, and their average price rose 1.7 percent from the previous three months, and 17 percent from a year earlier.

HEADLINE: How to Choose A Hot-Water Heater

BYLINE: By JAY ROMANO

 BODY:
ONE good thing about home hot-water heaters is that they require little maintenance and can last a decade or more before failing by springing a leak. The problem is, you usually don't know that the heater has failed until the leak has already sprung.
 ''We call them 'throw-away heaters,''' said Dick Toder, a principal of T/S Associates, a mechanical consultant in Manhattan. ''The day after the warranty runs out, the heater is living on borrowed time.'' 
Mr. Toder said that most residential hot-water heaters are electric- or gas-powered units that store anywhere from 30 to 50 gallons. The warranties on such appliances range from 3 years to as many as 12.
 ''So if your water heater is approaching or is past the warranty, it's time to think about replacing it,'' Mr. Toder said.
 Robert Bellini, president of Varsity Plumbing and Heating in Flushing, Queens, agreed. ''The problem with a storage-tank-type hot-water heater,'' he said, ''is that if it does rupture, you not only have the water in the tank to deal with, but you have the supply line that's going to keep on running until somebody shuts it off.'' 
 Mr. Bellini said that homeowners considering replacing their hot-water heaters should look for models that have the longest warranty and the shortest recovery time -- how long it takes for the heater to get water in the tank back to the desired temperature after it has been used. 
 Longer warranty periods, he said, are determined, in part, by a device in the heater known as an anode. ''This is a metal rod inside the tank that acts as a sacrificial lamb for corrosion,'' he said, explaining that while most hot-water tanks are lined with fiberglass, chemicals in the water eventually come in contact with the metal tank and corrode it. The anode, he said, takes the brunt of that beating. In better heaters, he said, there are two rods.
 Hot-water heaters also have different recovery times, with better heaters boasting faster times. Most manufacturers, he said, have both standard and high-recovery heaters. ''A standard heater will have a recovery rate of about 40 gallons an hour,'' he said. ''A high-recovery unit will recover about 55 gallons in the same time.'' Mr. Bellini said that depending on the size and quality of heater, replacing an existing hot-water heater with a new one can cost anywhere from $800 to $1,200.
 Harvey Sachs, buildings-program director for the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy, in Washington, said that hot-water heaters have different efficiency ratings. Most gas-fired hot-water heaters have energy efficiency ratings ranging from 0.60 to 0.65. ''That means that 60 to 65 percent of the energy in the gas ends up as hot water,'' he said, adding that most of the remaining 35 to 40 percent ends up going up its chimney both during and after combustion. 
 Electric hot-water heaters have energy efficiency ratings ranging from 0.93 to 0.95 because there is no chimney and almost all the energy goes into heating the water. 
 Does that mean that homeowners would be better off with an electric heater than a gas-fired one? ''No,'' Henry Gifford, owner of Gifford Fuel Saving, in Manhattan, said emphatically. ''Electricity is three or four times more expensive to use to heat water than natural gas. So even if an electric heater is more efficient than a gas-fired unit, the gas model will end up costing less to use.''
 Mr. Gifford said that the temperature of the water at the tap should be no more than 120 degrees Fahrenheit, and that both the tank and the hot-water pipes should be insulated.
 All experts agreed that a leak detector is important. Mr. Bellini said that inexpensive alarm-type detectors are fine if someone is home. A better solution, he said, is a device that costs $200 to $400 and shuts the supply line when a leak is detected.

HEADLINE: America's Last True Bargains 

BYLINE: By PATRICK O'GILFOIL HEALY

 BODY:
HERE are the stories of four towns the housing boom forgot.
 Their house prices have sat still or crept up slowly while values across the country raced past them at gold-rush pace.
For some people, these cheap markets represent the last true bargains in America. Bit by bit, families are relocating from expensive towns to affordable ones, drawn by the good housing stock and low home costs. 
 To understand the lure of these overlooked markets, it helps to begin with the median price of an existing home nationally-- $220,000 -- and see what it buys in these four locations. Go west, to Billings, Mont., and you can buy that median house and still have $80,000 left over. Head south, to Spartanburg, S.C., for an even better deal -- housing prices there are about half the national median. In upstate New York, the cheapest market in the Northeast, $220,000 will get you two houses in Binghamton and leave $40,000 to furnish them. In Youngstown, Ohio, you could buy almost three houses. 
 ''It's nothing compared to the rest of the country -- nothing,'' said Billie Briggs, a real estate agent in Binghamton, N.Y. ''We're still very affordable. I have schoolteachers who are looking to buy houses in the $70,000 to $85,000 range. A lot of times, people can buy mansions.''
 As with any cheap investment, homeowners in these areas risk buying a seed that will never sprout. Houses are inexpensive for a reason. Often, local economies are depressed, the population is aging and shrinking, and the cities are far from cultural and economic hubs. Families who have moved to these towns for their affordability say it has been painful to leave behind family and friends, yank their children from school and move to places that are physically remote and culturally foreign. Some have contemplated moving back.
 But day by day other transplants said they are making their decisions work. 

Binghamton, N.Y.
Median price: $93,000
 Even though home prices in Binghamton have grown 10 percent since 2002, the city remains one of the cheapest metropolitan housing markets in the Northeast, according to the latest quarterly index by the National Association of Realtors.
 Like Rochester, Buffalo and other struggling upstate cities, Binghamton saw its housing prices stagnate as the local economy shed nearly half its manufacturing jobs over the last 15 years. That trend may be starting to turn around, however. In the last few years unemployment levels have dropped and now stand at 4.7 percent, and real estate agents say housing prices are showing some bounce.
 Jim and Loretta Beals, a retired couple living on Long Island, are now trying to buy a ranch house in Binghamton before the prices bounce too high. After living in various parts of New York, they had retired to Long Island to be close to their children, but Mrs. Beals said she and her husband are weary of living in a two-room apartment attached to their children's home in Lindenhurst.
 ''Sometimes you just want a little more room,'' said Mrs. Beals, who worked for the state Department of Motor Vehicles and Department of Correctional Services before retiring. ''We couldn't afford to buy a home on Long Island, and the apartments are very expensive to rent,'' she said. 
 The couple began looking along Interstate 81 and near the Pennsylvania border. The commuter suburbs of New York City were too expensive, and Syracuse was nice, but too far away. Towns of 2,000 and 3,000 people were simply too quiet, Mrs. Beals said. Binghamton was affordable, and a four-hour drive from Long Island -- just close enough. 
 Meanwhile, two newlyweds, Rita and Scott Morgan, are reaping the economic benefits of buying in Vestal, in the Binghamton area, where Mr. Morgan got a job at the State University of New York. Ms. Morgan sold her three-bedroom town house in Wappingers Falls in Dutchess County for $215,000 and bought a larger home upstate for $160,000. It is a 1936 Cape Cod that sits on a half acre, and Ms. Morgan said she plans to put $20,000 into renovations. The rest of the profits will go toward the couple's savings and big-ticket purchases like furniture and a riding lawn mower.
 ''It's all-around much nicer,'' Ms. Morgan said. ''We're on a dead-end street in a beautiful section. We did very well.''

Billings, Mont.
Median price: $142,500
 After the online economy burst in 2001, Kim Backstrom found herself out of work and unable to afford her condominium in the San Francisco Bay area. She scraped for 18 months doing freelance graphic design work, but she ultimately put her condo on the market and began looking for a cheaper place to live.
 ''I'd done some research in the Internet and found out that I could make a good living and afford a good lifestyle'' in Montana, Ms. Backstrom said. ''It was kind of a crazy whim.''
 She wanted rocks, views and a dry climate, but not the unyielding heat of the Arizona deserts. She also wanted to buy a home that didn't require a large mortgage. Missoula was too expensive and other towns were too remote, so Ms. Backstrom bought in Billings, which the real estate firm Coldwell Banker this year named the cheapest market in Montana.
 She had sold her 1,300-square-foot condo in San Francisco for $325,000, and started looking for comparable condos in Montana until her real estate agent stopped her and described the buying power of $325,000 in Billings. Ultimately, she found an 80-year-old house downtown that covered 2,600 square feet and sat on half an acre. It cost her $140,000.
 Ms. Backstrom found a job designing advertisements for The Billings Gazette and hikes through the hills on weekends, but she said she sometimes feels unmoored, isolated from her old social and cultural nexuses. In San Francisco, culture seemed to drive to her doorstep. In Montana, she said, she has to prospect for it.
 ''It was definitely an adjustment,'' she said. ''I questioned, What am I doing here? I should have given poverty a try in California. Maybe it wouldn't have been so bad. I'm missing out on the sense of class and glamour. I feel like that's absent.''

Spartanburg, S.C.
Median price: $118,700
 Spartanburg used to be called Textile Town before the factories were shuttered and a new BMW plant became the city's main hope for economic health. The National Association of Realtors calls it one of the cheapest markets in the South, where the median home price has ticked up a mere 3 percent since 2002.
 It was those housing prices and the possibility of work at that BMW factory that lured Shirley and John Coleman to South Carolina from North Brunswick, N.J. 
 The couple, in sight of retirement, recently began considering how old age would affect their financial health and living standards. Could they pay their $7,000 annual property tax bills with pensions and Social Security? Were they happy with their social network?
 Then Mr. Coleman lost his job with Electrolux and Ms. Coleman, 53, had to quit her job in December for medical reasons. Suddenly, economic circumstance had decided. They would sell the house and move south, where land was cheaper and where their family once lived.
 ''It's just so hard now,'' Ms. Coleman said. ''The mortgage, the insurance, the car insurance and the taxes were just outrageous. We had to change our ways. We couldn't go out like we used to. Things just got really tight.''
 They began driving south. Virginia wasn't far enough for Mr. Coleman, so the couple visited North Carolina and looked at some ''really nice houses'' in Raleigh and Durham. Nothing captured their attention, so they continued on, landing in Spartanburg.
 They pounced on a foreclosure deal, paying $85,000 for a four-bedroom house with a large kitchen and a $600 annual property tax bill. The Colemans sold their house in New Jersey for $260,000, enough to pay for a roof and a kitchen floor in their new house, with plenty left over.
 ''We don't have the big bills,'' Ms. Coleman said. ''It'll be a different environment. We're ready for that, too -- ready to slow down.''

Youngstown, Ohio
Median price: $82,900
 Youngstown was an escape hatch for the Kaplin family.
 Three years ago, Ken Kaplin lost his job developing stealth technology, but he and his wife, Sherri, decided to stick it out at their home in New Haven. The Kaplins' children were in school and the family had a well-formed social network through their Orthodox Jewish synagogue.
 But three years passed with no job prospects for Mr. Kaplin, and the pressure of caring for children and aging parents forced Ms. Kaplin to give up her job as a certified nurse's assistant. With each month and each mortgage payment, the family carved itself more debt. They decided they had to sell the house, buy in a cheaper market and use the equity to pay their bills and survive until Mr. Kaplin found work.
 Mr. Kaplin began cross-checking cities with affordable housing against cities with Orthodox synagogues, quickly narrowing his search to Ohio. They discovered Youngstown, a struggling Rust Belt city whose economy is propped up by an aluminum factory. Home prices have dropped nearly 3 percent since last year, according to the National Association of Realtors.
 They needed a house within walking distance of a synagogue, one that would be big enough for Mr. and Ms. Kaplin and their two daughters, and the husband and wife's two aging mothers. And they needed the house to cost less than $200,000.
 In August, they bought a 2,800-square-foot colonial for $169,000. Previously owned by a doctor, it is just outside Youngstown, in Liberty Township, and has six bedrooms and a finished basement, Mr. Kaplin said. 
 The Kaplins' 6-year-old daughter took the move in stride, but they had problems placing their 15-year-old daughter in the right classes at school. She fell behind in her classes and has struggled to adjust to a new state where she knows no one, but has been making progress.
 Mr. Kaplin is looking for work in any field he can, as a truck driver, teacher or banker. The New Haven house remains a millstone. 
 The Kaplins gambled, buying in Ohio before selling their ranch-style home, on the market for $320,000. Once they close that deal, they said, they'll at last be free.

ONCE a warehouse used by Chinese restaurants around the city, the neo-Renaissance-style building at 415 Greenwich Street in TriBeCa is getting a gut renovation that will turn its old loading docks into multimillion-dollar ''bay houses'' with soaring interiors.
 The TriBeCa Summit building, a landmark that occupies the block between Laight and Hubert Streets, was completed in 1913. In 2000, it was turned into offices for the Globix Corporation, an Internet access company that filed for bankruptcy protection two years later.
After it emerged from bankruptcy, Ethan C. Eldon and Joel J. Silver, who formed a development partnership, snapped it up for $60 million. Both were former government officials in New York (Mr. Eldon with the Beame, Lindsay and Cuomo administrations, Mr. Silver with Lindsay). Mr. Eldon went on to become president of his own environmental consulting company and Mr. Silver to be executive vice president with Hoffritz for Cutlery and a real estate developer. 
 ''People had had their eyes on 415 Greenwich Street for a long time,'' Mr. Silver said. ''It was not on the market, but we approached them.''
 They were drawn to it, Mr. Eldon said, because ''with its granite and limestone facade and terra cotta cornices, we thought it was the most attractive building in TriBeCa.''
 Though some elements of the original structure are being preserved or restored -- the ramps over which the trucks drove, the awnings under which they passed, the numbers identifying the individual bays, the arched windows -- the interiors will bear no resemblance to their antecedents. 
 There will be three types of units: seven bay houses; 53 one-story, loft-style apartments; and six penthouses, which will be added to the existing roof. 
 Because of the depth of the building -- 125 feet -- the concept architect, Anthony Morali, designed three atriums reaching from the ground floor to the roof and topped with skylights. 
 ''They bring in light and air so that we could create legal bedrooms,'' Mr. Eldon said. Of the eight units on each floor, six will be bordered by one atrium or another, and all will also have exterior windows. The landscaping was designed by Thomas Balsley, the landscape architect. The project architect is H.Thomas O'Hara Jr. 
 In order to preserve the 15.6-foot ceilings, the bay houses will have a mezzanine level and additional rooms above. There will be room for residents to install private elevators. Two of the houses will be attached to private gardens. 
 ''This will be like having a suburban home in an urban setting,'' Mr. Silver said. But Mr. Eldon countered: ''I envision them as a super urban home in an industrial building with a modern industrial look.'' 
 Prices for the bay houses, which will range in size from 3,500 to 4,300 square feet, are expected to be $3 million to $4 million.
 The one-story lofts will have the same rambling ambience. Living rooms, for example, will measure more than 30 feet long, and the units will have two to four bedrooms. They are expected to be listed at $2 million to $3.5 million.
 The penthouses, all duplexes, will be enclosed by glass walls and will have terraces on both levels. They will also have wood-burning fireplaces and will fall into the range of $4 million to $6 million. 
 All the units in the building will have flexible layouts that can accommodate bedrooms, libraries or dens, and the amenities include bamboo floors, Bulthaup kitchens, Viking cooktops, Sub-Zero refrigerators, Bosch dishwashers, Kohler soaking tubs and marble bathroom vanities with teak cabinets. The building will also have a fitness center and children's playroom. 
 The target date for occupancy is the end of next summer. 
 The developers have not begun advertising and the only sign on the premises is in a ground-floor window, but they say they have already gotten 500 inquiries and have seven contracts out. 
 ''We can't tell you how many people say they will be back in January,'' Mr. Silver said, ''after they get their bonuses.''

HEADLINE: Gulotta and Gaffney (Remember Them?) Relish Their Private Lives 

BYLINE: By STEWART AIN

 BODY:
THEY have a lot in common, Thomas S. Gulotta and Robert J. Gaffney. 
 They were Long Island's previous county executives, Mr. Gulotta in Nassau and Mr. Gaffney in Suffolk. Each is 61. Each decided after a few terms not to seek re-election or higher office, and instead returned to the private sector by joining a Long Island law firm.
And both men, Republicans who were succeeded by Democrats, virtually disappeared from the spotlight when their terms expired, Mr. Gulotta at the end of 2001 and Mr. Gaffney at the end of 2003. 
 But their transitions to lives in private business have been strikingly different. 
 In physical terms, Mr. Gulotta's journey was the shorter -- just diagonally across Franklin Avenue in Garden City. Though his new office at Shaw, Licitra, Gulotta, Esernio & Schwartz is a bit smaller than his old one on the fourth floor of the Ralph G. Caso Executive and Legislative Building, it is otherwise a near-replica: the same bookcases, same white sofa, same busts of Theodore Roosevelt and Abraham Lincoln, even the same ruby-red carpet. (He had paid for the furnishings himself, not with tax money, Mr. Gulotta said in an interview, so they were his to take when he left office after 14 years as county executive.) 
 He has plenty to keep him occupied. Besides working for the law firm, he owns two small consulting companies to help individuals and corporations deal with local governments, Executive Strategies and Executive Properties; and in September, he was appointed by Gov. George E. Pataki to be a director of the United Nations Development Corporation, a state-sponsored agency that develops and manages the U.N.'s real estate in New York and provides office space, hotel rooms and other facilities for the U.N.
 On top of all that, he said, he is writing a book about mysterious deaths in Nassau County in the last century.
 But his old life is still with him. He receives as many as 50 invitations a month to community events, and said he tries to attend as many as he can, just as he did through 23 years of elected office, beginning with a State Assembly seat in 1978. 
 ''I wanted to lend the support of the office I held to those in the community who deserved special recognition,'' Mr. Gulotta said. ''I did it seven days a week, nights and weekends. We'd make five to seven stops a night, and on weekends, 25 to 30 stops a day.'' 
 ''It's a labor of love for me,'' he added.
 In his days as a politician, he was invited because of the posts he held, but ''now I'm invited personally, and I appreciate it very much,'' he said. 
 He no longer has official plaques and certificates to give out on these occasions, but sometimes he receives them: On Nov. 1, he is scheduled to be awarded the Theodore Roosevelt Chief Scout Citizen Award by the county Boy Scouts of America council. 
 Mr. Gulotta, who lives in North Merrick, also continues to receive many requests from residents who, to his surprise, seem to think he is still the Nassau county executive. One woman who wrote to him recently hoped he could cut through some red tape involving her late husband's worker's compensation payments, he said; another sought help in getting her autistic child into Camp Anchor, a Town of Hempstead recreation program in Lido Beach for children with disabilities. 
 Mr. Gulotta said he did not know the mother of the autistic child, Lisa Schimerman of East Meadow. But he made some calls anyway, and succeeded in securing a slot in the program for her child. 
 In a telephone interview, Mrs. Schimerman said she remembered Mr. Gulotta from her days years ago as a waitress at Two Brothers Pizzeria in Levittown, where he ate frequently. She said she last saw him five years ago, at a senior center's Christmas party in Lido Beach.
 ''I had my picture taken with him, and he handed me his card and said, 'If you ever need anything, call my office and feel free to ask,''' she recalled. 
 So when she had trouble enrolling her child in Camp Anchor, she called the county executive's office and asked for Mr. Gulotta by name. The attendant who answered the phone explained that he had left office and gave her his new number. 
 ''I love what I'm doing now,'' Mr. Gulotta said, ''because I can help people, either through the law firm, my two consulting firms or through my new U.N. involvement.''
 Mr. Gaffney, on the other hand, said he could recall encountering only one person since he left office at the end of 2003 who thought he was still the county executive. And he said the kinds of invitations to community events and beseeching letters from strangers that Mr. Gulotta still receives stopped reaching him long ago. 
 Why the difference? ''Everybody has different styles,'' Mr. Gaffney said in an interview. 
 For one thing, he said, though he often attended evening functions while in office, ''I never relished it.''
 Mr. Gaffney moved much farther than Mr. Gulotta when he left the public payroll: His new office at Meyer, Suozzi, English & Klein is on Route 110 in Melville, about 10 miles from the county center in Hauppauge. And he has put more distance between himself and the spotlight in other ways as well. 
 Mr. Gaffney, who lives in Miller Place, said that after 19 years in elective office, also starting with an Assembly seat, his transition to private life has been ''surprisingly and pleasantly easy.'' With three terms as county executive completed, he said, he was ready to move on. 
 ''I could have gotten the nomination'' for a fourth term, he said, ''but you have to want to do it. And part of wanting to do it is knowing that you could do it better than anybody else. I had reached the point where there were other opportunities.''
 While he enjoyed public service, he said: ''I also enjoy being a lawyer and a grandfather, and having a boat. Life is better. I enjoyed it while I was there, but I wouldn't go back.''
 The two men said that they had been approached in recent years about running for higher office in the state, and said that they turned the opportunity down. 
 Each said he had done well financially in the private sector, earning far more than a county executive's salary. (Mr. Gaffney was paid $160,000 in his last year in office, and Mr. Gulotta $110,000.)
 Mr. Gaffney, who graduated from Fordham Law School in 1969, spent four years as an F.B.I. agent and then began practicing law in 1973, mainly handling commercial litigation and real estate matters. Now he works alongside another former Suffolk County executive, John V.N. Klein, a senior partner at Meyer, Suozzi. 
 ''I represent a lot of major corporations and developers,'' Mr. Gaffney said. ''Business has been extraordinarily good. Most of my clients come because they have been recommended.'' He said he helped clients ''navigate through the always complicated legal, governmental and economic maze on Long Island.''
 And though he said he felt ''no need to get back into public service,'' Mr. Gaffney does have one more thing in common with Mr. Gulotta: an appointment from Governor Pataki. In April, the governor named him to the New York State Commission on Health Care Facilities in the 21st Century.

HEADLINE: The Budget Isn't Broken

BYLINE: By Seymour P. Lachman. 
Seymour P. Lachman, a professor at Adelphi University, was a Democratic state senator from Brooklyn and Staten Island from 1996 to 2004.

 BODY:
THIS Nov. 8, politicians in Albany are hoping to persuade New Yorkers that they are finally serious about fixing a dysfunctional Legislature that frequently misses budget deadlines. To this end, they have placed an initiative, known as Proposal 1, on the state ballot. This amendment would give greater budgetary authority to the Legislature, fundamentally altering the current budget process. It is one of the most sweeping and significant constitutional changes to be proposed in New York since the constitutional convention of 1967. 
 It's also a very bad idea. It would destroy one of the few parts of the budget process that is not, in fact, broken. To understand why voters should reject Proposal 1, look at the constitutional rules that now underlie budget making. 
In keeping with a basic principle of American government, the power to tax and spend rests with the State Legislature. But when it comes to budgetary details, the legislative branch in New York takes a back seat to the governor in some crucial respects. The Senate and Assembly are not allowed to produce their own spending plan from scratch. Instead, they have to work from a template of appropriations supplied by the governor, in the form of his annual executive budget. New York is one of 43 states that permits the governor to have a line-item veto; the Legislature, however, has the power to override with a two-thirds vote of both houses. 
 Why does the law give the governor the power to drive the budget-making process? The best explanation was supplied by Henry Stimson, a United States attorney for the Southern District of New York in the early 20th century who later served under five presidents. ''We cannot expect economy'' in the budget, he said, ''unless some one man will have to lie awake nights to accomplish it.''
 Of course, a strong degree of central authority is no guarantee of good budgetary results. Our dangerously growing state debt burden alone is proof enough of that. But at least it's clear who bears the ultimate responsibility for whatever goes right or wrong with the budget, and that's the governor. 
 For decades, legislative leaders have fought bitterly over budget issues with governors from both parties, from Franklin D. Roosevelt through George E. Pataki. The current leaders -- Joseph Bruno, the Senate majority leader, and Sheldon Silver, the Assembly speaker -- are no exceptions. These disputes culminated last year in a landmark Court of Appeals decision that strongly affirmed the governor's power and limited the Legislature's ability to alter his appropriations bills.
 Legislative leaders were understandably unhappy with this result. But even before the final decision was handed down, they had put together an amendment, embarking on a constitutional quick fix that will actually make the situation worse. 
 If Proposal 1 is approved, it will pave the way for the automatic expiration of the executive budget proposal at the end of each fiscal year. If the Senate and Assembly have not acted on the governor's proposals by then, legislators will be free to use the prior year's budget as a foundation for a spending plan of their own design. So if they don't like the governor's recommendations for the budget, it's in their interest to delay the process. 
 But the real problem is not that the law gives the governor so much authority, it's that Mr. Bruno and Mr. Silver have developed the political weight to wield so much power of their own. It's their objectives and desire for pork that stall the budget year after year. And if the proposal passes, they'll have only more power. To deal with the myriad complex issues associated with writing a $106 billion state budget, legislators will be heavily dependent on the legislatures' fiscal staffs -- whose members are all appointed by Mr. Bruno and Mr. Silver. 
 For all the criticism our Legislature engenders, this is not a matter of personalities but of principle. The democratic process in New York will be weakened if we shift the ultimate budgetary responsibility from an executive who answers to 19 million people, to 212 legislators who ultimately take their marching orders from two individuals -- the Senate leader, who represents just 310,000 people, and the Assembly speaker, who represents just 120,000. 
 New York's legislative process is, in many respects, in need of fundamental change. But the solution is not to rewrite one of the few provisions of our state Constitution that has stood the test of time.

HEADLINE: A Bite-Size Town Faces a McMansion Age

BYLINE: By PAULA GANZI LICATA

DATELINE: NORTH MERRICK 

 BODY:
THE houses are so small, residents say, some visitors ask whether elves and circus people live in their neighborhood, known as Tiny Town. Certain homes look more like dollhouses than residences. 
 Set close to the road on circular streets, some with itsy-bitsy porches and railings only two feet high, the houses -- no more than 12 feet wide and 60 feet deep, on lots 20 by 100 -- seem more fitting for an amusement park than a suburb.
But Methodists, not elves, are the reason for Tiny Town. 
 And development is the reason Tiny Town is in jeopardy.
 The North Merrick neighborhood, which is also known as the campgrounds, sprang from annual Methodist camp meetings in the 1800's. The campgrounds were designed in concentric circles with roads as short as the length of a house, like spokes in a wheel, leading to a center clearing where a large open structure on wooden posts was established as the tabernacle. Around the circle, tents were pitched and eventually cottages were built. 
 A plaque in the small triangular park at the intersection of Kingsley, Peck and Fletcher Avenues attests to the neighborhood's history: the annual camp meetings were held from 1869 to the early 1920's. The Long Island Camp Meeting Association, made up largely of Brooklyn and Queens County Methodists, bought more than 60 acres in 1869 for its summer revival meetings. 
 The area was chosen for its shady woods, access to water and proximity to the newly completed Southside Railroad, whose trains started running from Jamaica to Babylon in 1867 and stopped in Merrick daily. Horse-drawn wagons carried visitors the mile from the Merrick station to the open-air Methodist assembly.
 In 1873 there were about a dozen cottages alongside at least 200 tents in the campgrounds; by 1900 there were about 60 houses. Today, after the sale of cottages and lots so that new houses could be built, about two dozen remain in various sizes and states. The lots vary in size and shape, partly as a result of sales over the years. Some pie-shaped lots closest to the inner circle are small while others are larger, affording the ability to subdivide.
 Some of the cottages are still tiny, but many have been expanded. Some of the houses are gingerbread relics with Hansel and Gretel charm, while others have long needed care. 
 On Wesley Avenue, a chocolate-brown cottage features rose-pink trim on the ornamental scrollwork on the gables and eaves. 
 At a stone cottage on Wesley, passers-by can look through a rose-covered arbor and see the stained-glass window on the door. The interior is like that of an old railroad flat, with the living room in the front, a 2-foot-wide hallway with two 9-by-6-foot bedrooms on either side, and a bathroom and kitchen in the rear.
 Lori Weiner of Select A Home Island South Realty said that a dilapidated two-story house on Abbot Avenue sold for $247,000 this year; the new owner has done some work and has put it back on the market for $329,000.
 Those cottages that have not been torn down are remnants of an era in which camp meetings were popular in America and offered pastoral settings for fiery preaching, conversions and reaffirmations of faith. 
 As many as 10,000 people a day attended the Methodist camp meetings here. ''Each train is bringing in more candidates for salvation,'' said an article on Aug. 10, 1875, in The Brooklyn Daily Eagle. Visiting ministers and itinerant preachers conducted the services, which lasted 10 days, according to The New York Times in August 1870; the families stayed the summer.
 ''There will be a splendid chance for the boys and girls to go a-huckleberrying when they gather here,'' The Times reported on Aug. 6, 1873. ''The country for miles near the grove is thick with the berries, nice and ripe and easy of access, with no one save the mosquitoes to dispute the right to them.'' 
 Various accounts remark on such simple pleasures as the beauty of the grounds and the reprieve of cooling rains. But pleasure was not the purpose of the meetings; there were services at 10:30 a.m., 2:30 p.m. and 7:30 p.m. and Bible readings at 8:30 a.m., The Eagle said. 
 Those worshiping in the woods had to abide by campground rules. Cottages and tents had to be set back six feet from the street, tenants had to keep a lantern lighted at night and a bucket of water outside in case of fire. Dancing and card playing were forbidden.
 The avenue names evoke the neighborhood's history: Camp, Jerusalem, Dow (Lorenzo Dow was an itinerant Methodist preacher), Peck (Jesse T. Peck was a Methodist bishop in Syracuse). Wesley, the inner circle closest to the tabernacle, was named for John Wesley, the English clergyman who founded Methodism.
 Ellen Prochilo lives in one of the original cottages in the inner circle. Her house, built around 1878, was designated a home with historic merit by the Historical Society of the Merricks, and a plaque is on the house. 
 ''I like the uniqueness of it,'' she said of the area. 
 Many homeowners are hesitant to pursue historical status with the Town of Hempstead, however, because of restrictions impeding exterior renovations, like the brick inlaid New York Yankees logo on the Prochilo chimney. Only two houses in the area have received historical status from the town: 4 Peck Avenue (formerly the chapel) and 2 Wesley Avenue (originally the preacher's house). 
 Janet and Henry Kessin bought the preacher's house in 1982 and received landmark status in 1994. The Victorian structure has the original two-story wooden clapboard house from 1870 and 10-foot windows with the original wavy glass panes. ''We like old houses,'' Mr. Kessin said.
 But the old cottages are disappearing. The lots have been bought and the cottages torn down; on one lot on Gatch Avenue, a small Depression-era cottage, beyond the original circles, was razed and two large houses built. Siding, two-car garages and shiny white PVC fences are showing up in Tiny Town.
 ''The whole character of the neighborhood is almost gone,'' Mr. Kessin said.
 ''In the last three or four years the pace of developers has quickened with the incredible rise in real estate value,'' added Mr. Kessin, who said he was disappointed and not angry, acknowledging economic pressures.
 In 1873, 30-by-80-foot lots leased for $5 a year. In 1972, Joe Cook bought one of the original cottages on Wesley Avenue, which had fallen into disrepair, for $10,000.
 Mr. Cook estimated that he invested $10,000 in renovations, doing some of the work himself. ''The town claims it's worth $300,000 now,'' he said.

 BODY:
THERE is a move afoot at the United Nations and in the European Union to get the United States to give up control of the Internet -- a medium that America created and on which it now critically relies. 
 Disingenuously calling for a ''model of cooperation'' in Internet governance in advance of the World Summit on the Information Society to be held in Tunisia in November, the European commissioner for information society and media is opening the door to Internet regulation while saying that ''we have no intention to regulate the Internet.''
This maneuver amounts to a call for the United States to depend on the kindness of strangers in maintaining basic infrastructure that underpins our national security and economy. Moreover, it threatens to whittle away the freedom of the Internet with a series of seemingly minor and well-intentioned compromises that begin with something that sounds as reasonable as a ''model of cooperation.'' 
 Any society needs certain basics to enable it to function. If the United States had not created a postal service and post roads, for example, national commerce could not have developed. Airports and air routes, railways and highways are just modern-day post roads. The Internet is one more step in this evolution. It provides new tools for communication (supplementing regular mail with e-mail), buying and selling goods (electronic retailing with goods delivered by public and private mail services), financial transactions, and much more. 
 The Internet has become an integral part of the global economy, in large part because the United States has also provided the genius of our technology to other societies that use it to benefit themselves, including in doing business and competing with the United States. So it was only a matter of time before foreign powers began asking who should control the electronic superhighway on which they now rely for their national well-being, something that America has built, paid for and maintained. 
 Their eyes have turned to a California-based nonprofit organization created by the Commerce Department in 1998, the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers, that administers and keeps track of all Web addresses worldwide. Icann, as it is called, operates largely free from government interference -- the Commerce Department has never overruled an Icann decision, believing that government should not become involved in Internet governance. And local authorities in other countries are free to set policy for their country-specific extensions (.ca for Canada, .de for Germany, etc.). But only Icann ultimately has the authority to allow a site onto the Net, or not, by virtue of its role of maintaining a master list of domain names. Imagine how much certain governments would covet such power. 
 American values caused the Internet to emerge and evolve as a medium of freedom. While there is a standard of transcendent decency that can and should regulate Internet communication in such matters as child pornography, there are standards of national self-interest that vary from country to country. China sees the Internet as part of its internal infrastructure and seeks to govern it as such, monitoring and censoring communications that include words like ''liberty,'' ''Tiananmen Square'' or ''Falun Gong,'' and going after dissidents who use the Internet. 
 Internationalizing control of a medium now regulated with a loose hand by a nation committed to maximizing freedom would inevitably create more of an opening for countries like China -- a strong proponent of imposing some international supervision of Icann -- to exert more pressure on internet service providers. More broadly, international regulation could enable like-minded governments to work in concert to deem certain thoughts impermissible online. It is all too possible that minority political or religious expressions would be widely repressed under a doctrine of the greater good imposed by a collective of governments claiming to know what's best, limiting what may be expressed online to whatever, say, the United Nations General Assembly, the European Union, or the Arab League, might deem reasonable. 
 Any society may, of course, choose to create its own balkanized domestic version of the Internet, an Intranet within its borders that it regulates as it pleases. It could then still do within its borders many of the things done by the Internet, like Brazil's online tax collection system, but would not enjoy the online privilege of worldwide interaction. 
 The Internet is an attractive commercial infrastructure for all societies, even oppressive ones. But the string attached to its creation by America is that it must be used within a context of freedom, both economic and political. That is a democratic value that we should not be shy about exporting. Accepting that commitment to online freedom should be the price that foreign governments must pay for the blessing of the Internet in their national economic lives.

HEADLINE: Slippery Devil, That Real Estate 'Bubble' 

BYLINE: By MOTOKO RICH and DAVID LEONHARDT

 BODY:
JUST about everybody has taken to using the word ''bubble'' when talking about the housing market.
 Among the optimists who have embraced the idea is a condominium developer in Miami who is running an advertisement for two new properties that shows a woman blowing an enormous chewing-gum bubble above the word ''Boom!'' And at the Mortgage Bankers Association, the chief economist, Doug Duncan, says he subscribes to the Don Ho way of thinking, referring to the singer's hit, ''Tiny Bubbles.''
But the pessimists aren't surrendering the metaphor they started. Robert Shiller, an economist whose 2000 book predicted the stock market crash, has re-released the book with a new cover warning of ''the world wide real estate bubble and its aftermath.'' 
 All of which leads to the question: Does the word ''bubble'' have any meaning anymore? 
 In some cases, the word indicates a market in which prices have gone up so far and so fast that they are destined to crash, as some fretted when a recent report showed that Manhattan apartment prices had dropped 13 percent from July through September. 
 Others use ''bubble'' to suggest that prices could drift along for years to come. They might trail inflation for as much as a generation, even if the nature of real estate, with its slow and infrequent transactions, prevents a Nasdaq-like collapse.
 To many developers, brokers and bankers -- not to mention homeowners -- who all have a big stake in the boom, the word has come to symbolize a fabulous market that is likely to slow eventually. The 15 percent annual price jumps of recent years will gently ease into 5 or 8 percent increases, they say.
 Even some who insist there is no bubble in real estate use a similar metaphor. David Lereah, chief economist for the National Association of Realtors and the author of a recent book urging people to buy more real estate, said ''air will come out of the balloon'' in coming months.
 It is still not clear who will end up being right about house prices, but the vast housing industry has already chalked up one victory by muddying the linguistic waters like this. If the true worrywarts convince you that there is indeed a bubble, but real estate agents tell you that it is not so bad, you might just go ahead and buy a vacation home with no money down. 
 Grant Barrett, a lexicographer for Oxford University Press in New York, compares this obfuscation to the linguistic tactics of politics.
 ''It's that weird behavior of trying to make a word mean what you want it to mean,'' Mr. Barrett said. ''We call it the thesaurus defense: it's basically redefining a word in order to suit their own point of view and in order to make themselves feel right or sound right.''
 To be fair, there is no precise economic definition of a bubble, and uncovering one in the housing market is particularly tricky. When the same question came up about the stock market in the late 1990's, the terms of the debate were clearer. People who used the word ''bubble'' generally meant that stock prices would soon fall sharply, which they did. 
 But the real estate market is not nearly as volatile as the stock market. Deals are not done in a day. When house sellers cannot get the price they want, they often wait, instead of panicking. The worst declines in real estate values usually happen over years, often at the hands of inflation rather than in the form of a sudden decline.
 That means that even popped bubbles do not always go by that name. During the most recent real estate downturn, in the late 1980's and early 1990's, prices fell by more than 10 percent in New York and more than 20 percent in Los Angeles, according to the National Association of Realtors. 
 Adjusted for inflation, the losses were far worse: about 30 percent in parts of the Northeast and even more than that in Southern California. Prices peaked in about 1988 and did not return to their highs -- relative to the price of everything else in the economy -- until about 2000.
 In Boston, where prices fell 25 percent in the early 1990's, after adjusting for inflation, ''people were bringing checks to the table'' to cover shortfalls in selling prices because their mortgages were larger than what the buyer paid, said Robert Buckley, a real estate lawyer in Boston.
 Yet there is far less talk today about the 1990's real estate crash than there is about the 2000 stock market crash, despite the current obsession with housing. Slow declines are simply not as memorable, and real estate agents like to talk in terms of list prices, which present a sunnier if less meaningful picture than inflation-adjusted numbers do. 
 ''I don't believe real estate acts in any way that could be a bubble, because a bubble pops and real estate doesn't explode overnight,'' said Pamela Liebman, chief executive of the Corcoran Group, one of New York's largest real estate firms. What happened in Manhattan in the first half of the 1990's, she said, was ''a slow leaking.''
 Adding to the current confusion is a flurry of recent statistics that have pointed every which way. The Commerce Department reported last week that the number of homes starting to be built last month surged more than 10 percent compared with a year ago, a sign of builder optimism. But the number of existing homes for sale in several markets, including New York, Boston and Washington, is also rising, as is the average amount of time it takes to sell a home. In Manhattan, the recent fall in apartment prices caused The New York Post to exclaim, ''Real Estate in Bubble Trouble.''
 Taken as a whole, the numbers suggest that the hottest markets really are cooling off, in a way that seems more serious than other pauses of recent years. Still, both versions of the boom's end -- the gentle one and the harsh one -- look possible. So both definitions of bubble remain in play.
 For the average homeowner, though, a definition of bubble that avoids all these subtleties might be the best one of all. ''Anyone who bought after you bought,'' suggests Erin McKean, editor in chief of the Oxford American Dictionary in Chicago, ''bought in a bubble.''

HEADLINE: At Marymount, Defying Extinction

BYLINE: By Kate Stone Lombardi

DATELINE: Tarrytown 

 BODY:
WHEN Marta Holliday, the student speaker at Marymount College's 2004 graduation, urged her classmates to ''make headlines,'' she never imagined that, a year later, those headlines would announce the closing of the college she loved.
 ''When I heard the news, I took it very personally,'' said Ms. Holliday, who is now a graduate student at the University of Iowa. ''It was really almost as if I heard that a beloved family member had passed away.''
Ms. Holliday is one of Marymount's 9,707 living alumnae, and the feeling of loss she described has been echoed many times over in recent days. 
 ''It's devastating,'' said Joyce Onorato Abamont, '66, president of the alumnae board. ''Most of us had such wonderful experiences, not just academically but socially and spiritually at Marymount. All of our past history will never be passed on to anyone else.''
 Fordham University announced earlier this month that classes at Marymount would be phased out in 2007, the college's centennial year. Fordham and Marymount had consolidated in 2000, as a result of a 20-year decline in enrollment at Marymount. Elizabeth Schmalz, a spokeswoman for Fordham, said that the decline proved unstoppable despite extensive administrative, academic and financial support from the university. 
 ''It's a very sad event for all of us,'' Ms. Schmalz said. ''Everyone has been pouring their heart and soul into this college trying to make it viable, but there were just obstacles we couldn't overcome.'' 
 Chief among them, she said, was the lack of what administrators call ''retention'' -- the fact that in 2004 for example, 45 percent of the freshman class chose not to return to Marymount for sophomore year. In general, she noted, it has become increasingly difficult to attract students to a religiously affiliated women's college.
 Yet to alumnae, the Marymount diploma is clearly something special. Many speak of the close bonds among classmates. They describe devoted professors. Experiencing an all-women's college, they say, gave them confidence and leadership skills that would not have been fostered in a coeducational environment.
 Melissa McCoy-Garzione, president-elect of the Alumnae Association, says she has been flooded with calls and e-mail messages since the closing was announced. Many alumnae expressed shock. Some had anticipated changes -- perhaps that the college would begin to accept men -- but few expected that the institution they knew would cease to exist.
 One wonders what Mother Marie Butler would have made of the announcement. Mother Butler opened Marymount in 1908 with only one pupil, though five others followed shortly thereafter. By 1917 the college had expanded, with courses in language, history, philosophy, law and political economy added to the curriculum. At the time few women were studying these subjects, but Mother Butler was committed to women's education.
 ''The world never needed women's intelligence and sympathy more than it does today,'' she said in 1917. That year, an advertisement for the college read, ''The time is gone when to be feminine meant to be helpless.''
 Mother Butler's educational ideal was based on what she called the three C's: Catholicity, Charity and Courtesy. But that didn't mean the school wasn't forward thinking. In 1923, Marymount became the first women's college to establish a Junior Year Abroad program. The college continued to expand in buildings and enrollment. In 1957, a publication celebrating the 50th anniversary concluded, ''Marymount's future is bright.''
 During the 1960's and 1970's, students were active in the civil rights and antiwar movements, staging sit-ins and wearing black armbands. An art history professor, Sister Elizabeth McAlister, gained notice when she married Philip Berrigan, a priest and antiwar activist. They were later excommunicated. Enrollment peaked in 1978 with 1,112 students, but by 1998 had dropped to 523. There are now 798 women enrolled; juniors and seniors will finish their education at Marymount; freshmen and sophomores can complete their degrees at Fordham if they choose.
 After 2007, what was Marymount College -- the 25-acre campus valued at $22 million -- will be known as the Marymount Campus of Fordham University. Beyond that it will exist in the memories of more than 9,000 women. 
 ''The name of the walls will change, but they are forever going to symbolize who we are and where we came from,'' Ms. McCoy-Garzione said. ''We will continue to go back to reunions, reflect on the school's mission, and we will do them proud by maintaining that connection.''

HEADLINE: Vying to Offer New Airborne Comforts

BYLINE: By ELSA BRENNER

DATELINE: PURCHASE 

 BODY:
IN Greek mythology, Eos was the goddess of the dawn; in more modern times, the name has been conferred on everything from Canon cameras to the satellites of NASA's Earth Observing System. Now a startup airline based in Purchase has joined their ranks. On Tuesday, Eos inaugurated its business-class-only service from Kennedy International Airport to Stansted Airport near London. 
 ''We're not going to try to be all things to all people,'' said Eos's founder, David J. Spurlock, who lives in Greenwich, Conn., and used to be a strategy director for British Airways. But with a fleet of three leased Boeing 757's luxuriously reconfigured to carry 48 passengers instead of 200, just what is Eos trying to do? 
The answer is simple, said Mr. Spurlock: Take advantage of a growing market for business travelers especially entrepreneurs and those working for small businesses. 
 Eos is one of several startup carriers to introduce all-business-class services following Delta and Northwest Airlines' filings for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in September. Another trans-Atlantic startup offering business-only class is MAXjet, based in Dulles, Va., which will also start flying between Stansted and Kennedy this fall using Boeing 767's, which are slightly larger.
 ''I believe this product will prove highly addictive,'' said Mr. Spurlock (he would not give exact numbers on bookings for either the initial flight or subsequent daily flights to and from London). On the maiden flight Wednesday, most seats were taken, albeit with Eos executives and board members. He predicted that the addiction to the added space and privacy would take as long as four months to ''catch on with customers.'' 
 Eos has a $5,000 introductory round-trip fare, which will climb to $6,500 early next year. By comparison, MAXjet fares start at about $1,600 round trip. Eos is clearly banking on the hope that its fewer passengers (48 versus 102), greater privacy and lavish amenities will be irresistible. 
 These amenities start with a relatively large convertible seat, which can be used either as a chair and desk combination or laid out flat as a bed (MAXjet's seats are not as flexible). A second seat is provided in each traveler's 21-square-foot space so colleagues can work or dine together. Mr. Spurlock said he was particularly bullish on the cashmere blankets and pillows made of memory foam, developed by NASA to cushion astronauts' bodies during space travel. 
 Passengers will also have access to noise-reducing headphones, small laptop computers, and meals and other food and drinks at their convenience, rather than at scheduled times. An additional asset, he said, is the airline's destination choice of Stansted, rather than Heathrow or Gatwick, which most of the larger airlines use. Stansted allows a faster trip to the Canary Wharf business and banking district in London.
 Mr. Spurlock says he is not competing with large companies like British Airways and Virgin Atlantic, which offer business class, first class and economy sections. 
 Robert W. Mann Jr., an airline industry consultant in Port Washington, N.Y., concurred with that assessment, saying that Eos's target is smaller businesses, because they are an underserved segment of the market. ''What the meal is for him,'' Mr. Mann said, ''are the crumbs for others.'' 
 ''He's not looking for the large corporate accounts,'' he said. ''He's really targeting the small-business owner, the entrepreneur who's paying first class or nondiscount and getting the bum's rush from the other guys. The real issue is not that Eos is competing against them, but that it is going after a different part of the market.'' But Mr. Mann added that he foresaw some difficulties, because larger carriers will be able to ''outschedule them and out-loyalty-program them.'' 
 The company was financed with $87 million from private equity groups, the second-highest amount for a startup airline, Mr. Spurlock said. JetBlue Airways, which offers economy fares, started five years ago with $129 million in capital.
 As for why Purchase was chosen for the new company's headquarters, Mr. Spurlock said he had wanted to be close to New York City and Kennedy Airport. Eos, which employs about 150 people, has taken 40,000 square feet of office space in a building near the Connecticut border for its operations and contact center.
 The area of Westchester where Eos has leased office space -- near Rye, Harrison and Purchase -- is fast becoming one of the most popular for businesses in the county because of its proximity to many highways and to Greenwich, Conn., where many businesses have established offices and where commercial rental rates are far higher -- in some cases twice as high.
 It's not the only airline to make a similar decision. Atlas Air Worldwide Holdings, which provides cargo services, is also based in Purchase, and CitationShares, a company providing fractional aircraft ownership and private jet travel, is based nearby in Greenwich.

HEADLINE: The Budget Isn't Broken

BYLINE: By Seymour P. Lachman. 
Seymour P. Lachman, a professor at Adelphi University, was a Democratic state senator from Brooklyn and Staten Island from 1996 to 2004.

 BODY:
THIS Nov. 8, politicians in Albany are hoping to persuade New Yorkers that they are finally serious about fixing a dysfunctional Legislature that frequently misses budget deadlines. To this end, they have placed an initiative, known as Proposal 1, on the state ballot. This amendment would give greater budgetary authority to the Legislature, fundamentally altering the current budget process. It is one of the most sweeping and significant constitutional changes to be proposed in New York since the constitutional convention of 1967. 
 It's also a very bad idea. It would destroy one of the few parts of the budget process that is not, in fact, broken. To understand why voters should reject Proposal 1, look at the constitutional rules that now underlie budget making. 
In keeping with a basic principle of American government, the power to tax and spend rests with the State Legislature. But when it comes to budgetary details, the legislative branch in New York takes a back seat to the governor in some crucial respects. The Senate and Assembly are not allowed to produce their own spending plan from scratch. Instead, they have to work from a template of appropriations supplied by the governor, in the form of his annual executive budget. New York is one of 43 states that permits the governor to have a line-item veto; the Legislature, however, has the power to override with a two-thirds vote of both houses. 
 Why does the law give the governor the power to drive the budget-making process? One of the best explanations was supplied by Henry Stimson, a United States attorney for the Southern District of New York in the early 20th century who later served under five presidents. ''We cannot expect economy'' in the budget, he said, ''unless some one man will have to lie awake nights to accomplish it.''
 Of course, a strong degree of central authority is no guarantee of good budgetary results. Our dangerously growing state debt burden alone is proof enough of that. But at least it's clear who bears the ultimate responsibility for whatever goes right or wrong with the budget, and that's the governor. 
 For decades, legislative leaders have fought bitterly over budget issues with governors from both parties, from Franklin D. Roosevelt through George E. Pataki. The current leaders -- Joseph Bruno, the Senate majority leader, and Sheldon Silver, the Assembly speaker -- are no exceptions. These disputes culminated last year in a landmark Court of Appeals decision that strongly affirmed the governor's power and limited the Legislature's ability to alter his appropriations bills.
 Legislative leaders were understandably unhappy with this result. But even before the final decision was handed down, they had put together an amendment, embarking on a constitutional quick fix that will actually make the situation worse. 
 If Proposal 1 is approved, it will pave the way for the automatic expiration of the executive budget proposal at the end of each fiscal year. If the Senate and Assembly have not acted on the governor's proposals by then, legislators will be free to use the prior year's budget as a foundation for a spending plan of their own design. So if they don't like the governor's recommendations for the budget, it's in their interest to delay the process. 
 But the real problem is not that the law gives the governor so much authority, it's that Mr. Bruno and Mr. Silver have developed the political weight to wield so much power of their own. It's their objectives and desire for pork that stall the budget year after year. And if the proposal passes, they'll have only more power. To deal with the myriad complex issues associated with writing a $106 billion state budget, legislators will be heavily dependent on the legislatures' fiscal staffs -- whose members are mostly appointed by the Senate majority leader and the Assembly speaker. 
 For all the criticism our Legislature engenders, this is not a matter of personalities but of principle. The democratic process in New York will be weakened if we shift the ultimate budgetary responsibility from an executive who answers to 19 million people, to 212 legislators who ultimately take their marching orders from two individuals -- the Senate leader, who represents just 310,000 people, and the Assembly speaker, who represents just 125,000. 
 New York's legislative process is, in many respects, in need of fundamental change. But the solution is not to rewrite one of the few provisions of our state Constitution that has stood the test of time.

Iraq's Deadliest Street Fight
The streets of Ramadi have become one of Iraq's main battlefields, where Sunni Arab insurgents are waging a fierce war against American troops. Every day the Americans fight to hold their turf against an enemy who seems to be everywhere but is not often seen. 1

An initial set of official voting results showed Sunni Arab voters in at least one province overwhelmingly rejecting the new constitution, further evidence that the vote had largely divided along ethnic and sectarian lines. 4

Few C.I.A. Charges in Deaths
Despite indications of Central Intelligence Agency involvement in the deaths of at least four prisoners in Iraq and Afghanistan, C.I.A. employees now appear likely to escape criminal charges in all but one of those incidents, according to current and former intelligence and law enforcement officials. 6

Hurricane Still Lashing Cancun
Hurricane Wilma stalled over Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula, pounding the beach resorts of Cancun and Playa del Carmen and stranding tens of thousands of tourists in hot, leaky shelters while a maelstrom of howling winds, uprooted trees and hurtling debris raged on all sides. 1

Injured Are Dying in Pakistan
After the earthquake in Pakistan that killed more than 53,000 people, wounds and injuries that have not received medical attention are contributing to a second wave of deaths. The problem is not only the shortage of help; it is the magnitude of the destruction, and time is the enemy. 14

U.N. Details Syrian Plot
The United Nations report on the killing of Rafik Hariri, a former prime minister of Lebanon, traces in detail months of plotting by top Syrian intelligence officials, including President Bashar al-Assad's powerful brother-in-law, and their Lebanese proxies that included constant surveillance of Mr. Hariri's movements. 16

Health Care to Bankruptcy
Never before have patients had so many medical options to extend, enrich or alter their lives. But these new options are expensive, and with them has come a change for which many Americans -- even those with health insurance -- are financially ill prepared. 1

New Orleans Houses to Fall
As crews begin inspecting thousands of rotting houses in New Orleans and preservationists begin efforts to save them, city and federal officials say that 30,000 to 50,000 of the city's houses, or up to a quarter of the city's housing stock, will probably have to be demolished. 1

Dynamics of Disaster Giving
Donations for the victims of the earthquake that ripped through Pakistan and India have not come even close to the level of giving that followed the tsunami that wreaked havoc around the rim of the Indian Ocean or Hurricane Katrina, which destroyed a huge swath of the Gulf Coast. But fund-raising experts say the generosity directed toward the victims of those disasters was rare. 18

Trying to Monitor E-Mail
The federal government is requiring hundreds of universities, private companies and cities to overhaul their Internet computer networks to make it easier for law enforcement authorities to monitor e-mail and other online communications. 1

Nominee Supported Diversity
When President Bush's latest Supreme Court nominee, Harriet E. Miers, was moving toward the presidency of the State Bar of Texas in 1992, she supported an effort by the group to guarantee positions on its board of directors to female and minority lawyers, her two immediate predecessors said. The current attorney general was among the first lawyers to win appointment to the board under the program. 30

Less Need for Foster Care
The number of New York City children in foster care has dropped to roughly 18,000 -- half what it was just six years ago, because of a good economy, a drop in crack cocaine use, and a policy shift that tries to keep families intact, said city officials and other experts. 33

HEADLINE: For Blacks, A Dream In Decline

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE

 BODY:
THE Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. set forth the goal. Civil rights and union membership were to be intertwined. The labor movement, Dr. King wrote in 1958, ''must concentrate its powerful forces on bringing economic emancipation to white and Negro by organizing them together in social equality.''
 That happened in the 1960's and 1970's. But then unions lost bargaining power and members. And while labor leaders called attention to the overall decline, few took notice that blacks were losing much more ground than whites.
 In the last five years, that trend accelerated. Despite a growing economy, the number of African-Americans in unions has fallen by 14.4 percent since 2000, while white membership is down 5.4 percent. 
 For a while in the 1980's, one out of every four black workers was a union member; now it is closer to one in seven. This loss of better-paying jobs helps to explain why blacks are doing worse than any other group in the current recovery. Labor leaders have acknowledged the disproportionate damage to African-Americans, but they decline to make special efforts to organize blacks and offset the decrease, saying that all groups need help. That lack of priority angers one prominent black scholar. 
 ''The future of black workers is very bleak indeed if they lose their place in the union movement,'' said William Julius Wilson, a professor of sociology and social policy at Harvard. ''I would hope there would be an effort on the part of union leaders, white and black, to address this very important issue. They haven't done so as yet.''
 The decline was particularly sharp last year. Overall union membership fell by 304,000, and blacks accounted for 55 percent of that drop, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reports, even though whites outnumber blacks six to one in unions (12.4 million to 2.1 million). The trend seems likely to continue and perhaps accelerate as General Motors and its principal parts supplier, Delphi, cut costs in their struggle to be profitable.
 ''We have lost 20,000 members since the end of 2000 in Detroit and its suburbs alone,'' said Linda Ewing, director of research for the United Auto Workers, ''and a large number of the workers in the auto and parts plants in this area are black.'' 
 Unions, like other institutions in the post-World War II economy, were slow to admit African-Americans to the club, and there is still resistance today in some of the higher-paying skilled trades. Yet blacks came to rely on unions even more than working class whites did to gain entry into the middle class, through jobs that gave them annual wage increases and company-paid health insurance and pensions. Even now, the percentage of black workers who are in unions is slightly greater than the percentage of unionized white workers: 15.1 versus 12.2. ''Every survey shows that blacks are the group that most wants to be unionized,'' said Richard Freeman, a Harvard labor economist.
 Immigration, retirement, automation, the shifting of work overseas, low seniority and privatization have all played a role in the lopsided decline of unionized jobs held by African-Americans. That decline is especially noticeable in manufacturing and the federal government, two strongholds of black employment that have gone through cutbacks in union workers in recent years.
 The cutbacks are particularly severe in the auto industry. In addition to the latest problems at G.M., Ford Motor said Thursday that it would soon announce ''significant plant closings.''
 The impact on blacks has gradually drawn the attention of labor leaders, including John J. Sweeney, president of the A.F.L.-C.I.O. ''The percentage of black workers who have been knocked out of union jobs is one of the little-known tragedies of the last five years,'' he said.
 Despite this damage, the federation is not making a special effort to sign up more African-Americans in other industries, Mr. Sweeney said. ''We are going to be organizing more blacks,'' he explained, ''but we are also going to be organizing more Latinos and more women.'' 
 Mr. Sweeney's reluctance to single out blacks has its counterpart in the breakaway union movement, Change to Win, which promises more aggressive organizing. Rather than focus on any particular group of workers, said Edgar Romney, secretary-treasurer of the new coalition, ''we are targeting industries and communities in our organizing effort.''
 Blue-collar workers earn high pay in manufacturing jobs, and the sharp decline in black union membership in that sector has helped to pull down the median weekly wage of all black workers, union and nonunion alike. Thus far this year, the median weekly wage earned by blacks fell by 5 percent, to $523, adjusted for inflation, according to an analysis of Bureau of Labor Statistics data. Whites as a group are also experiencing a drop in their median weekly wage, but for them the decline this year is less than 1 percent, to $677, adjusted for inflation. 
 Some labor economists bridle at such comparisons. Robert Topel of the University of Chicago argues that for many years the wage gap between whites and blacks either shrank or remained stable, after adjusting for differences in education, experience and other factors. This occurred even as union power declined, he said.
 ''If you ask me for a list of things that would be more important in understanding racial disparities and economic success, unionism would not be high on the list,'' Mr. Topel said. ''Education, development of skills and family environment all play much bigger roles than collective bargaining power.''
 The decline in black union membership is not simply the result of the erosion of employment in manufacturing. The Service Employees International Union, for example, represented for years large numbers of African-Americans employed in food service, janitorial work and nursing home care. Many were women. As they retired, Hispanics and Asians replaced them, in the jobs and as union members, said Patricia Ford, a former executive vice president of the S.E.I.U. 
 ''You can see the change from what was traditionally African-American to Hispanic,'' Ms. Ford said. ''That is the most striking.''
 Union membership among Hispanics, in fact, has risen gradually in this decade, to 1.7 million last year. That is partly a result of special efforts to organize Hispanics in service industries, Mr. Romney said.
 On another front, privatization and outsourcing have eaten away at federal employment of black workers represented by the American Federation of Government Employees, which says that nearly 25 percent of its 211,000 members are black. 
 African-Americans make up an even higher percentage of the union's members at the operations that the Bush administration is turning over to private contractors. These include laundries at veterans' hospitals, ground maintenance and food service at government installations and security guards at numerous federal buildings -- much of it work that paid only $15,000 to $20,000 a year, but that came with pensions and health insurance.
 The union's leaders resist viewing what is happening in racial terms. ''We see it as a class issue rather than a race issue,'' said Sharon Pinnock, the A.F.G.E.'s director for membership and organization. ''It is impacting all workers, black and white.''
 Automation at the Postal Service, mainly in the form of sorting machines that require many fewer workers, has cut into the ranks of the National Association of Letter Carriers and the American Postal Workers Union, both with high percentages of blacks among their members.
 And then there is the tendency of many corporations to move operations to suburbs from downtown locations. In the process, unionized African-American workers are often replaced by nonunion workers, in many cases white.
 The Communications Workers of America makes that complaint, citing customer service call center operations as one example. ''They gradually move to the suburbs, eliminating African-American union members in the city,'' said George Kohl, the union's senior director of collective bargaining.
 Mr. Sweeney said such stories anger him. ''We have learned a lot from the civil rights movement; it is important that we highlight the most egregious offenses,'' he said. ''But we have to focus on all the workers who are getting hurt.''

HEADLINE: The Arts Administration

BYLINE: By JENNIFER STEINHAUER

 BODY:
MAYOR MICHAEL R. BLOOMBERG is not wildly fond of looking at art. 
 This should not insult anyone. Spectating is just not his thing.
In his pre-mayoral days, when he attended the opera with his friend Beverly Sills, he would fall into a slumber ended with a sharp jab of her elbow. During a private tour of the Vatican in 2000, the thing that piqued his interest was the church's collection of Bloomberg terminals, an aide who traveled with him recalled. 
 Television? Movies? Concerts? Happenings? Never, rarely (unless they feature Will Ferrell), reluctantly and not on purpose. 
 Even his own enormous personal art collection, which ranges from the Hudson River School to 20th-century masters, has not been built through the sorts of obsessions and longings that guide most collectors. He works with a dealer and a decorator, and has a hard time remembering when and where he even acquired some works. When it comes to choosing art for his corporation or the city -- with the exception of the few times he has requested something huge, challenging and preferably next-to-impossible to install -- he also delegates taste to the art experts around him.
 But in the most striking paradox of his mayoralty, his administration has done more to promote and support the arts than any in a generation.
 Under Mr. Bloomberg, public art has flourished in every corner of the city -- from ''Element E,'' a Roy Lichtenstein sculpture in the center of the former Tweed Courthouse, to a classic limestone statue in the Bronx, to ''The Gates,'' set up by Christo and Jeanne-Claude last winter in Central Park, a project for which he personally lobbied for almost a decade. The city's art commission, once knee-capped by the Giuliani administration as an elitist irritant, has been empowered at the highest level, with a voice in every significant public-works project in the city. 
 Mr. Bloomberg doles out city arts awards, and holds quiet dinners for less-endowed arts institutions, where he woos potential donors and board members over cocktails and burgers. He has donated millions of dollars from his own fortune to various art groups. His administration has borrowed significant works of art for City Hall and the lawn of Gracie Mansion. 
 Even something as prosaic as the city government's directory -- known as the Green Book -- now features modern artworks on its cover. This year, instead of green, it will be saffron, in honor of ''The Gates.''
 The mayor's arts agenda has infused policy-making throughout the municipal government. The administration has created the first public school arts curriculum in a generation, and created zoning policies to encourage the growth of the art galleries in Chelsea. In the process, it has developed a constituency that is perhaps more enamored of the mayor than any other special interest group in the city. 
 Mr. Bloomberg ''clearly understands that the small dance company with the office in the choreographer's kitchen is as much a part of what makes New York the great vibrant city that it is as the Met,'' said Ruby Lerner, president of Creative Capital, a nonprofit arts foundation that does not receive city money. 
 ''That the reason artists want to be here, to stay here, to come here,'' she added, ''is the dynamic mix between the institutional and the individual, the commercial and nonprofit, the flow back and forth, the incredible diversity here, aesthetic, cultural -- the striving aspiration of all, at every level, to set the highest standards.''
 Beyond that, Mr. Bloomberg knows, art brings in tourists and deep-pocketed sophisticates. World-class cities have buildings designed by famous architects, controversial public art pieces and passels of van Goghs. World-class cities in turn attract large companies, community investment and good international press.
 Art, in short, is good business.
 ''It's not about personal aesthetics,'' said Patricia E. Harris, Mr. Bloomberg's closest aide and the force behind much of his art agenda. ''I think it is very pragmatic.'' 
 Nothing in particular about Mr. Bloomberg's 2001 campaign suggested he would place an emphasis on the arts. Indeed, in his first budget, Mayor Bloomberg hacked away at the operating budget of the Department of Cultural Affairs, infuriating some of the city's largest arts institutions. He reneged on the Giuliani administration's promise to turn the spectacular 19th-century Tweed Courthouse into the Museum of the City of New York, opting instead to put the Department of Education there. The building has too much natural light for art to be properly viewed, he said just last week, adding: ''What is more important than our children!''
 Still, as one of his first acts as mayor, he dispensed with the ''decency commission'' that Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani had set up to contemplate standards for museums, formed in the wake of the ''Sensation'' show at the Brooklyn Museum. And he mentioned to Ms. Harris that he would like to see ''The Gates'' -- for which, as a Central Park Conservancy board member, he had lobbied unsuccessfully -- finally erected.
 A few months later, men were seen wheeling giant bubble-wrapped objects into City Hall, past the security desk and into the mayor's side of the building. With little fanfare, the city had borrowed nine paintings and three sculptures from the Whitney Museum of American Art. The mayor's ceremonial office, a pair of tobacco-scented rooms where predecessors hammered out deals, is now basically an art gallery. Rare works from the city's archives dot the rest of the building, a striking contrast to municipal offices that are usually painted the color of a pediatrician's restroom and adorned with ripped maps.
 Later that year, he revived the Doris C. Freedman Awards, named for one of the city's first cultural affairs commissioners. Even the grating hold music at the City Hall switchboard was replaced by Wynton Marsalis performing with the Lincoln Center Jazz Orchestra.
 The larger city was brought in on the change, as public artworks began popping up all over the five boroughs with the Bloomberg administration's direct help. What was going on here? 
 In truth, no one much noticed.
 The city was lurching toward a fiscal crisis, and disconsolate over the recent terrorist attacks. Firehouses were closing in Brooklyn, and normal people were staring suspiciously into the eyes of the passengers seated next to them on the A train, looking for signs of ill intent. There was not a lot of chatter about lofty arts awards, or the growing number of wacky large-scale sculptures dotting the city's parks.
 Then, word leaked out about something that gets every New Yorker's attention: large sums of money. It was disclosed that Mr. Bloomberg had given $10 million of his own money to the Carnegie Corporation to benefit 162 small and medium-size cultural institutions around the city, in awards ranging from $25,000 to $100,000. (The mayor has repeated this gesture three times; the latest gift was $20 million.)
 The donation blunted criticism about his budget-cutting. But it also sealed the view that he was friendly to the arts. ''The Carnegie gift was very smart,'' said Gabriella de Ferrari, an New York art critic and curator. ''He is there for the art world. And remember, some of the things we do are not exactly uncontroversial.''
 That, it seems, is part of the appeal.
 The mayor of New York is the consummate insider, but Mr. Bloomberg relishes his self-generated reputation as the outsider insider, the person who owes no one anything, who pushes on doors that others had fastened shut. He is fond of boasting about how he started his own company against the advice of othersand only after being fired with flourish from Salomon Brothers in 1981. Even his first mayoral campaign began as something of a large citywide joke. 
 While his life choices have led him to wealth and power, his aides say he is endlessly intrigued with anyone who defies convention in pursuit of some large-scale goal. Mayor Giuliani denounced ''Sensation,'' but Mr. Bloomberg attended its opening reception with Ms. Harris. 
 Last year, Kate D. Levin, his cultural affairs commissioner, encouraged him to see ''The Hard Nut,'' Mark Morris's postmodern take on ''The Nutcracker,'' at the Brooklyn Academy of Music. The off-beat, slightly twisted piece left him riveted. ''He'll say, 'It never occurred to me someone could think that way,''' Ms. Levin said. ''He was really intrigued.''
 Some argue that while Mr. Bloomberg may favor established venues, he has been openly hostile to artists plying their wares on the street, even after a court ruling in their favor. ''He and his commissioners have continued to harass street artists in every park in New York City,'' said Robert Lederman, who is president of Artists' Response to Illegal State Tactics. ''I realize that Mike Bloomberg is an arts collector that has contributed to many arts institutions but that doesn't translate into money for artists. We believed he would automatically have a great deal of respect for artists, but we have not found that to be the case.''
 The city's rising fortunes aren't uniformly beneficial to artists, either. As the art market has heated up, so has the real estate market, driving struggling painters, experimental dance troupes and shoestring theater groups further out of the neighborhoods they have traditionally occupied -- not just the East Village and Soho in Manhattan, but now Williamsburg and Red Hook in Brooklyn, too. That has been the city's loss as well: during this administration, some artist communities have been forced into exile, reassembling in Jersey City or Poughkeepsie.
 ''What was so great about New York when I came here 15 years ago was it was still possible for artists to find places to work and live that were affordable,'' said Randy Wray, a painter and sculpture who lives in Williamsburg, and has moved four times as rents have risen. ''For a number of years, graduate students I met around the country told me that they wanted to move to New York, and that seems to be diminishing. I wonder what impact that might have on the New York art world.''
 As for the art that does capture the mayor's attention, the unifying theme is not school or period, but rather sheer scale.
 At his company, Bloomberg L.P., then on Park Avenue, he decided the open area to the right of the elevator banks looked a little bare. After looking at several proposals, he opted for a 20-foot glass work by the artist Michael Scheiner -- a sprawling installation that hung from the ceiling and spanned, octopuslike, across a staircase and hovered over the conference tables. The artist worked in the middle of the night for months to install it, and Mr. Bloomberg would check the progress each morning when he arrived at 7. 
 As a board member of Lincoln Center in 1999, Mr. Bloomberg used his largess and lobbying to get ''The Peony Pavilion,'' a 20-hour classic Chinese opera, to New York after officials in Shanghai refused to allow the performers to leave China. 
 As mayor, he saw a huge sculpture in the Seagram Building, and decided that the former Tweed Courthouse needed one too. The result is the 50-foot-tall sculpture by Roy Lichtenstein, part of the artist's series called ''Five Brushstrokes.'' 
 And visiting Athens in 2002, Mayor Bloomberg was fascinated by the Acropolis, but much the same way he had been with Visy Paper, a recycling plant he toured on Staten Island. It is the mechanics, the feat of engineering, the bureaucratic obstacles that intrigue him. 
 As for issues that require hours of contemplation, his friends, his aides and reporters can all attest, he is simply not built for them. (He can barely even suffer through the civic duty of Mets and Yankees games, and then only with beer and ample doses of popcorn.) 
 Mr. Bloomberg attends Broadway shows because that is what mayors do, but has been overheard more than once complaining about it -- don't get him started on ''Hairspray.'' ''He is more into participation than observation,'' said his spokesman, Edward Skyler. ''That is just the way he is. He would rather be running than watching sports. He would rather be learning Spanish than watching a movie. He would rather be making policy than listening to speeches.'' 
 His own art collection includes 19th- and 20th-century paintings, porcelain objects, a Lichtenstein sculpture, and two preparatory drawings of ''The Gates,'' one of them 96 inches tall. ''I don't have any more wall space left and I just don't have time,'' said Mr. Bloomberg during a brief chat last week. ''I get home at 11, I am up to run at 5, out by 7. Who has time?''
 When it comes to choosing most of the art that decorates the city's landscape -- like the five Isamu Noguchi sculptures now on the Gracie Mansion lawn -- Mr. Bloomberg relies on the management technique he applies to the rest of governing: he delegates. 
 ''I think he is knowledgeable about contemporary art,'' said Christo in an interview, ''because he is surrounded by people who are knowledgeable about contemporary art.''
 Ms. Harris, who oversaw Mr. Bloomberg's philanthropy at his company, is the city's unofficial curator, selecting the works the mayor ultimately approves for City Hall, Gracie Mansion, city publications and elsewhere. He has allowed Commissioner Levin -- who is married to the sculptor Mark di Suvero -- to extend her reach to numerous areas of government.
 She helped to develop a zoning policy that let mid-block building owners in Chelsea transfer their air rights to the corner of blocks, a move that left mid-block galleries insulated against rent inflation. Her development of a mandated arts curriculum for public school students is the first of its kind since the city gutted arts education during the 1970's fiscal crisis.
 Ms. Levin is also working with the city agency that preserves and develops housing on a program to address the long-standing problem of artists who are being priced out of the neighborhoods they help gentrify. 
 City agencies have also been instructed to smooth the path for artists to to let weird stuff happen without impediment. Tom Eccles, the former director of the Public Art Fund, a nonprofit group that presents art around the city, remembered a procession from Midtown to Queens to celebrate the temporary movement of the Museum of Modern Art in 2002. ''We needed the support of the police department,'' he said, ''and that would have been unthinkable under the Giuliani administration because you weren't given that kind of platform and were not treated with that level of respect.''
 While posing for a photograph in front of the Lichtenstein sculpture, Mr. Bloomberg mused about when he bought his own far smaller Lichtenstein piece, ''one of the pencils.'' He could not recall when, or from whom. ''I think I saw it in a catalog,'' he said, ''no, maybe it was in a gallery. No, it was definitely a catalog.''
 And then, he was off.

HEADLINE: Will a Term of Endearment Extend 4 More Years?

BYLINE: By Maura J. Casey. 
Maura J. Casey is an editorial writer for The Day of New London.

 BODY:
GOV. M. JODI RELL has finally said that she will indeed run for governor in next year's election, an announcement that surprised almost no one. She enters the campaign more popular than any governor in memory. Why?
 Her opponents said it's because residents see Mrs. Rell as the ''anti-Rowland,'' replacing Gov. John G. Rowland after he resigned. By such reasoning, her high popularity was almost inevitable. After months of scandal, a weary state probably would have cheered if the Easter Bunny had become governor. 
But that view doesn't entirely explain the stratospheric nature of Mrs. Rell's poll numbers, in which she has had an approval rating of 70 percent or higher for nearly 16 months. It also doesn't rationalize the extraordinary depth of her appeal to ordinary people. 
 I glimpsed this recently while helping at a concession stand during my 11-year-old son's football game. I listened, fascinated, as middle-class people whom I rarely hear discuss politics spoke of Mrs. Rell as if she were a combination of Joan of Arc and a really, really nice neighbor.
 ''I met Mrs. Rell,'' one woman said enthusiastically as she flipped burgers and described, in minute detail, a momentary encounter she had with the governor during a rally to save the submarine base in Groton. She was thrilled that the governor solicited her opinion about the efforts to save the base from closing. The encounter lasted only a few moments, but it was clear which candidate would win her vote next year.
 But while residents are clearly smitten with Mrs. Rell now, that is no guarantee that they will be similarly infatuated when they vote next year. The course of any political race depends on voter mood, and this winter will test those emotions. 
 The price of energy has already risen and is expected to climb this winter, dramatically raising the cost of heating homes and businesses. If consumer prices also rise as a result, and if job growth remains slow, voters may take these pocketbook issues out on Mrs. Rell, providing an opening to her challengers.
 For the moment, her two biggest Democratic opponents are big-city mayors with track records of dealing with economic issues. Dannel Malloy of Stamford and John DeStefano of New Haven each have a decade of experience leading their cities, and that experience could make Mrs. Rell vulnerable if voters become frustrated this winter. Both mayors said that once the campaign begins in earnest, her poll numbers will drift down to earth. 
 ''The debate hasn't even begun yet,'' Mr. DeStefano said last month.
 He ticked off reasons voters should be worried: Connecticut leads New England in the loss of manufacturing jobs, traffic is a nightmare, children can't afford to live in the towns in which they grew up and retirees can't afford their property taxes.
 ''Is Connecticut a better place for your kids to grow up than it was for you?'' Mr. DeStefano said. ''Or is it a worse place to grow up in? I'm a practical guy. I'm a mayor. We can do better than this.''
 When asked about Mrs. Rell's popularity, Mr. Malloy gives a similar answer.
 ''Consumer confidence is lower in Connecticut than the national average,'' he said. ''Poverty is growing faster here than the national average. Connecticut ranks 50th of 50 states in job retention and growth. A year is an eternity in politics. Jodi Rell gets huge poll numbers for not being John Rowland, but I'm not John Rowland, either.''
 Both mayors are ready to hit hard on the issues, and if those topics take center stage in the campaign, we're in for the best gubernatorial race in years. 
 Mrs. Rell points out that she has the most crucial executive experience necessary: She is the incumbent.
 ''I've been governor for 15 months,'' she said in a recent interview. ''It's been interesting, and it hasn't always been easy. Everyone wants answers to problems yesterday and it doesn't happen that fast. But we're aiming to help people with the issues of jobs and the economy.''
 She doesn't dwell on her popularity.
 ''I'm honored and flattered by the poll numbers, but I try not to look at them,'' she said.
 But if voters aren't worried -- or if they are but believe that there just isn't much the state can do to help -- the politics of personality could decide the race. Then Mrs. Rell's greatest asset will be tough to beat: her easy rapport with people, her ability to listen, her honesty and warmth. 
 The lofty poll numbers haven't soared merely because Jodi Rell isn't John Rowland. They're high because Jodi Rell is who she is, and so far, people like what they see. Depending on where the economy goes, combined with the power of incumbency, that may be enough to keep voters content and reward Mrs. Rell with a four-year term of her own.

HEADLINE: The Savior Of The Right

BYLINE: By DAVID BROOKS

 BODY:
The economist Bruce Bartlett is a man of immense intellectual integrity. In an era when many commentators write whatever will affirm the prejudices of their own team, Bartlett follows his conscience and has paid a price. He was fired by his conservative think tank for being critical of President Bush.
 Along the way, he's emerged as the most articulate spokesman for the view, which I hear all the time now, that Bush has betrayed conservatism. Bush, the argument goes, has radically increased spending on housing, community development, farm subsidies and a raft of big government programs. He's federalized the American education system. He's failed to seal the borders against illegal immigration. He's created a huge new entitlement program and exploded the deficits. He's increased government regulation and hasn't even nominated a true conservative for the Supreme Court. 
 It's a coherent case, but it's wrong. Bush hasn't abandoned conservatism; he's modernized and saved it. If we're going to have one of our periodic conservative crackups -- which, in case you haven't noticed, is what we are in the middle of -- let's at least learn the right lessons from the past 10 years. 
 Let's start by remembering where conservatism was before Bush came on the scene. In the late 1990's, after the failure of the government shutdown, conservatism was adrift and bereft of ideas. 
 Voters preferred Democratic ideas on issue after issue by 20-point margins. The G.O.P.'s foreign policy views were veering toward isolationism, its immigration policy was veering toward nativism, its social conservatism had crossed into censoriousness, and after it became clear that voters didn't want to slash government, its domestic policy had hit a dead end. 
 Almost single-handedly, Bush reconnected with the positive and idealistic instincts of middle-class Americans. He did it by recasting conservatism more significantly than anyone had since Ronald Reagan. He rejected the prejudice that the private sector is good and the public sector is bad, and he tried to use government to encourage responsible citizenship and community service. He sought to mobilize government so the children of prisoners can build their lives, so parents can get data to measure their school's performance, so millions of AIDS victims in Africa can live another day, so people around the world can dream of freedom.
 ''Government should help people improve their lives, not run their lives,'' Bush said. This is not the Government-Is-the-Problem philosophy of the mid-'90s, but the philosophy of a governing majority party in a country where people look to government to play a positive but not overbearing role in their lives. 
 In part because of Bush's shift, the G.O.P. has become the party of the middle class. Bush beat Kerry among whites earning between $30,000 and $75,000 a year by 22 percentage points. 
 This is not to say that Bush's approach to government is fully coherent. The tragedy of the Bush administration is that it never matched its unorthodox governing philosophy with an unorthodox political strategy or an unorthodox management style. With his policies, Bush could have built a broad coalition across the right and center of American life. Unfortunately, his political strategy was a base strategy, which led him to reinforce the orthodox divisions between the parties.
 Despite all the mistakes that have been made, it is nonetheless true that Bush has ennobled and saved American conservatism. As the G.O.P. moves forward, its leaders will break into two camps, post-Bush and pre-Bush. The post-Bush conservatives will build on the changes Bush introduced and refine his vision of using government positively to give people the tools to run their own lives. The pre-Bush conservatives will try to go back to the libertarianism and social conservatism of 1995. 
 The future belongs to post-Bush conservatives. If you want a glimpse of that future, read the speech David Cameron gave earlier this month, which electrified the British Conservative Party conference. Cameron has learned the essential lessons of Bushism. He offered a positive, governing conservatism. He talked about helping moms afford child care and helping the people of Darfur survive. ''A modern, compassionate conservatism is right for our times,'' he declared. 
 He's right. In some ways future conservatives will be different from President Bush. But they will not succeed unless they absorb the essential lessons that are George Bush's best legacy.

HEADLINE: An Endorsement for Mayor

 BODY:
New Yorkers used to share with the rest of the nation a conviction that the city was, for all its good points, basically ungovernable. That seems quaint now -- like the idea that Broadway is populated by colorful Runyonesque guys and dolls, or that cab drivers are all wise guys from Brooklyn. The city has put the financial meltdown of the 1970's behind it, along with its legendary icons of dysfunctional government -- Fort Apache, subways as graffiti art, armies of homeless people sleeping in cardboard boxes. Three other mayors played a part in pulling New York out of its hole. But under Michael R. Bloomberg, everything came together. 
 Mr. Bloomberg, who is running for re-election on the Republican line against Fernando Ferrer, the Democratic candidate, has accomplished a great deal in four years. His greatest achievement has been to teach New Yorkers that good government is not a zero sum game; that even in a city where every neighborhood, block and building jealously guards some ancient prerogative, change can make things better for everybody. 
Mr. Bloomberg has not been nearly as exciting, or entertaining, as Edward I. Koch or Rudolph W. Giuliani. But he has been better at running the city. If he continues his record of accomplishment over the next four years, he may be remembered as one of the greatest mayors in New York history.
 Unfortunately, his chances of reaching that kind of status are reduced by one great flaw in his political resume -- his out-of-control campaign spending. In 2001 Mr. Bloomberg spent $75 million of his vast fortune to get elected. He argued at the time that as an unknown Republican in an overwhelmingly Democratic city, he needed to introduce himself and his ideas.
 This year, with all the advantages of an incumbent, he was still unwilling to take on the less well-known Mr. Ferrer in an even fight. He bypassed campaign spending limits and blanketed the airwaves with almost $20 million in ads. His lavish purchase of TV time drove up the cost of advertising, making it even more difficult for any other voice to be heard. 
 Money cannot compensate for a terrible candidate; there are plenty of very rich men who could not spend their way into office. But it can undermine the election process. Mr. Bloomberg, safe in his self-financed campaign, has felt free to ignore the city's excellent campaign finance laws on every issue from spending limits to where and when he should debate Mr. Ferrer. The result has been a muffled, unsatisfactory race. 
 The obscene spending is particularly regrettable because it threatens to overshadow all the good the mayor has done. It would be tragic if Mr. Bloomberg were mainly remembered as the rich man who bought two elections, and paid far too much for the second one, when he has so many achievements. 
 New York policy wonks of a certain age can remember when Ed Koch was acclaimed for winning the right to put only two men on sanitation trucks; Mr. Bloomberg quietly negotiated one-man trucks on some routes. Mr. Giuliani won plaudits for shutting down the unpopular landfill in Staten Island, but failed to come up with a workable plan to get rid of the displaced garbage; Mayor Bloomberg offered an environmentally sensible solution. From the popular 311 phone system for reporting complaints to its generally humane solutions for the homeless, the administration focused on getting things done, not on getting headlines.
 Under Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly, the crime rate has fallen farther than even the wildest optimists imagined during the Giuliani crime-fighting years, and unlike Mr. Giuliani, Mr. Bloomberg seems to have no problem sharing the credit with Mr. Kelly. Perhaps most important, Mr. Bloomberg has managed to achieve all this in an atmosphere of racial harmony. He has shown that it's possible to fight crime without fighting the communities where most crime occurs.
 Fernando Ferrer, the former Bronx borough president, has run a creditable race, but his major campaign point -- the existence of two New Yorks, rich and poor -- actually argues Mr. Bloomberg's case. No mayor has devoted more effort to improving the schools, the poor children's lifeline. The city's public hospitals have been transformed in many neighborhoods. And if Mr. Bloomberg stole a page from Mr. Ferrer's playbook in his recently announced plan for building more affordable housing, it was a good page to hijack.
 New York may be governable, but getting things done in a place this complicated still requires an intense, and perhaps even irritating, self-assertiveness -- something Mr. Ferrer seems to lack. Mr. Bloomberg has no problems on that front, but he has not always managed to be in control without being dictatorial. To be fair, we've tended to appreciate his indifference to public opinion when we agreed with him -- for instance when he stuck to his guns on a smoking ban in bars. But we were downright alarmed by his stubbornness in pushing for a West Side stadium for the Jets when most of the city thought it was the wrong use for a critical piece of land. Mr. Bloomberg has a daunting agenda for a second term, including much more work on improving the schools and a serious attempt to help restore Lower Manhattan. Those goals can't be met if the mayor piles up bad feeling and resentment.
 This page cares deeply about making elections fair and open, and if Mr. Bloomberg's administration had been anything less than distinguished, his insistence on undermining the campaign finance system would disqualify him from our support. As it is, with that one caveat in mind, we enthusiastically endorse Michael Bloomberg for mayor.

HEADLINE: Sometimes, There Is Strength in Smaller Numbers 

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH HARRIS

 BODY:
JOHN W. ROGERS JR. sticks to a familiar investing principle: buy what you know. For Mr. Rogers, a longtime Chicago resident, one such investment is the Tribune Company, which, among many other properties, owns the Chicago Cubs and The Chicago Tribune.
 Despite recent tribulations at the company concerning overstated circulation at two of its newspapers, a huge tax bill and a general advertising malaise, Mr. Rogers has owned the stock for about 10 years and it remains one of his largest holdings; the fund has 36 stocks.
Mr. Rogers, who runs the Ariel Appreciation fund, is among those mutual fund managers who prefer to concentrate their investments on a relatively small number of picks. 
 ''We think the best way to outperform over the long run,'' he said, ''is to invest in a few number of issues that you know better than your competitors.'' 
 Concentrated funds can range from small- to large-cap and from value to growth styles. But all focus on a more limited number of stocks than the usual mutual fund. There is no firm definition, but most concentrated funds have more than 40 percent of their money devoted to their top 10 holdings, or have 30 or fewer total holdings. Such large bets on specific companies have often not paid off as much as more diversified approaches. Still, over the very long haul, many of these funds' managers have surpassed their peers.
 ''These sorts of funds have set themselves up to outperform by virtue of the fact that individual picks can really make a difference,'' said Paul Herbert, a senior fund analyst at Morningstar.
 In theory, their advantage comes from simple math: putting 5 percent of a portfolio into a rising stock will bolster the fund's overall return by much more than a 1 percent stake. But, of course, concentrated funds can also amplify losses. And so far in 2005, extremely diversified domestic equity funds, or those with 20 percent or less of their total assets in their top 10 holdings, are neck and neck with concentrated ones -- in this case defined as those with 40 percent or more of their money in their top 10. But extremely diversified funds are doing much better over the last 12 months and three and five years, according to Morningstar. Diversified stock funds rose 16.9 percent, on average, over the 12 months through September, surpassing the 16.1 percent gain by concentrated funds. The diversified funds were ahead over the longer terms, too: they were up 19.1 percent a year, on average, over the last three years, versus 18 percent for the concentrated funds, and were up 2.1 percent a year over the five years, compared with the concentrated funds' loss of 0.1 percent. 
 Over a much longer period, however, the concentrated funds come out slightly ahead. They returned 8.9 percent a year, on average, over the last 10 years, versus 8.7 percent for the diversified funds, according to Morningstar. 
 For Mr. Rogers, it isn't a surprise that his Ariel Appreciation fund, with $3.4 billion in assets, has lagged behind its peers in Morningstar's midcap blend category. The fund lost 1.8 percent this year through Thursday, versus the category average's gain of 0.8 percent, according to Morningstar. Owning no oil or energy stocks has held the fund back, he said. And some of its favorite industries -- newspaper and financial companies -- have been out of favor. 
 But as a buy-and-hold investor who likens his approach to that of Warren E. Buffett, Mr. Rogers says he avoids highly leveraged, cyclical companies. ''A lot of us who believe in the Warren Buffett style of investing have an aversion to the commodity-oriented companies,'' Mr. Rogers said.
 A lack of energy stocks is also partly responsible for the performance of the Oakmark Select fund this year, said Bill Nygren, co-manager of the fund, which has $5.9 billion in assets. It lost 3.3 percent through Thursday, versus a loss of nearly 1 percent for its large-cap value category. ''We have not been willing to believe that the spike we'd seen in commodity prices was permanent,'' Mr. Nygren said. 
 Alternatively, some managers of concentrated funds that did own energy stocks have seen their funds gain ground. The roughly $500 million ICAP Select Equity fund earned 3.9 percent this year through September, compared with an average loss of roughly 1 percent for large-cap value funds, according to Morningstar. 
 This year, the co-managers Robert H. Lyon and Jerrold K. Senser have devoted about 14 percent of the fund's holdings to energy stocks, including ConocoPhillips, Marathon Oil and Halliburton, Mr. Senser said. 
 ''If you haven't had a meaningful exposure to energy, it's been a very difficult year,'' Mr. Senser said.
 Many investors can benefit from a dose of the right concentrated fund, Mr. Herbert of Morningstar said. In June, Morningstar began recommending 10 focused funds based on a complex sorting that sought the best long-term returns, low turnover and solid management -- all qualities to look for when selecting one of these portfolios, Mr. Herbert said. (The funds of Mr. Rogers and Mr. Nygren are among those 10.) 
 ''You're not going to get that many ideas right over time -- even with the best manager -- and this focus of research attention on fewer ideas makes sense,'' Mr. Herbert said.
 Others are less convinced. 
 William F. Sharpe, a Nobel winner in economics and the founder of Financial Engines, an investment research and advisory firm based in Palo Alto, Calif., questions whether investors should concentrate their investments. Sometimes Dr. Sharpe's own work is cited in support of investing in a small number of securities, but he said that it had been misinterpreted. Many years ago, he demonstrated that investment risk decreased as you raised the number of securities you held, but that once you reached 20 or 30 holdings, each additional selection would not lower risk substantially. That conclusion may have encouraged some to favor concentrated portfolios, he said.
 ''I always feel badly when that crops up,'' Dr. Sharpe said. ''The mathematics of my example were impeccable, I think, but people have run with that who wanted to use it to justify concentration.'' 
 In theory, he said, concentrated portfolios may work, but they generally require an unusual quality in a manager: the ability to pick underpriced stocks regularly and consistently. And his original example assessed the statistical risk of a portfolio of securities picked at random and held in equal dollar amounts -- not the way most people invest, he said. Looking at a portfolio's statistical risk, or standard deviation, is a good tool, he said, but is not enough to account for everything that might happen in the markets.
 ''What you're particularly worried about is what happens when everything falls apart,'' Dr. Sharpe said.
 Cynthia L. Conger, a certified financial planner in Little Rock, Ark., cautions investors against putting their faith in a small number of stocks.
 ''Diversification, whether in a portfolio or in a mutual fund, is what saves you from having to time the market,'' Ms. Conger said. ''When you have a limited number of companies in a portfolio, you're banking that you picked the right company.''
 But as a value manager, Mr. Rogers says he is accustomed to thinking for the longer term -- he typically owns a stock for about five years -- and is not necessarily worried about temporary bad news. Recently, Mr. Rogers has added to his stakes in financial and insurance companies including Ambac and MBIA, which, at 10 times forward earnings, are each trading at a discount, he said, because of current worries about their exposure from hurricane damage and more general concern about a real estate bubble. 
 IN the case of the Tribune Company, he says he believes that the stock will recover from recent lows because potential start-up competitors would have trouble supplanting it, he said. 
 The fund has gained 14 percent, annualized, over the three years through Thursday, compared with 18.1 percent for its peers in the midcap blend category. But the fund was up 11.1 percent a year, on average, over the last five years, according to Morningstar, ahead of the category average of 6.2 percent.
 For Mr. Rogers, the long-term approach is in keeping with his and his firm's philosophy, exemplified by the company's logo -- a turtle. He says it is a good reminder of some important virtues.
 ''Patience and slow and steady win the race,'' Mr. Rogers said.

HEADLINE: The Fall Of the Warrior King

BYLINE: By Dexter Filkins. 
Dexter Filkins is a correspondent for The New York Times based in Baghdad. He has been covering the war in Iraq since it began in March 2003.

 BODY:
The body had not yet turned up. Indeed, at that point, early in January 2004, it wasn't clear there was a body at all. Months later, at the trial, the lawyers would still be arguing about it, the puffy, wrinkled corpse that was finally found floating face down in an irrigation canal off the Tigris. But even then, even before the dead man surfaced, it was clear that something had gone wrong on that cold Iraqi night down by the river, something wild by the American military's standards of discipline and force, and the problem had wended its way up the chain of command to the unit's commander, Lt. Col. Nathan Sassaman. 
Even in an Army in which ferocious competition produced nearly perfect specimens of brains and lethality, Sassaman stood apart. Commanding some 800 soldiers in the heart of the insurgency-ravaged Sunni Triangle, Sassaman, then 40, had distinguished himself as one of the nimblest, most aggressive officers in Iraq. From his base in Balad, a largely Shiite city in a sea of Sunni villages, Sassaman bucked the civilian authorities and held local elections months earlier than in most of the country's other towns and cities. His relations with the locals in Balad were so warm that on each Friday afternoon, inside a circle of tanks on an empty field, his men would face off against the Iraqis for a game of soccer. He was a West Point grad and the son of a Methodist minister. As quarterback for Army's football team in the 1980's, he ran for 1,002 yards in a single season and carried West Point's team to its first bowl victory. Everyone in the Army knew of Nate Sassaman.
 Yet as his junior officers briefed him in January about what had happened to two Iraqis his men detained that night by the Tigris, the straight lines and rigid hierarchy of the Army that had created him seemed, like so many other American ideas brought to this murky land, no longer particularly relevant. More important, Sassaman told me later, were his own men, most of them 19- and 20-year-old kids plunked down in this seething country, wearing themselves out to keep the enterprise going, coming under fire four or five times a day. The same day that his men took the two Iraqis down to the river, he attended a memorial service for one of his ablest junior officers, Capt. Eric Paliwoda, whose heart had been punctured by mortar shrapnel and whom Sassaman had lifted into a medevac helicopter as the last of his life drained away.
 There would be a fuss if his superiors discovered what his men had done that night, Sassaman did not doubt. It would be the kind of indignation you could expect from people who didn't really know what it was like to fight and live in this place. Sure, it was a dumb thing, but his men had assured him that neither of the Iraqis had been hurt. His best platoon commander even jumped into the water a couple of days later to prove the point. And so Sassaman, standing on the porch of the battalion's command post, decided to flout his 19 years in the Army and his straight-and-narrow upbringing. He turned to one of his company commanders, Capt. Matthew Cunningham, and told him what to do.
 ''Tell them about everything,'' Sassaman said, ''except the water.''
 The events that would end the career of one of the Army's most celebrated midlevel officers sent a shock through the American force in Iraq. It is only now, with the Army's investigation complete and Sassaman's career over, that the story can be pieced together from interviews with him, his comrades and the Iraqis. Twenty-two months after that night on the Tigris, it is a tale that seems like a parable of the dark passage that lay ahead for the Americans in Iraq.
 Marwan and Zaydoon Fadhil, cousins in the central Iraqi city of Samarra, had driven their white Kia truck to within a few hundred yards of their home when a group of American soldiers waved them to the side of the road. The Fadhils had arrived from Baghdad, ferrying a load of toilet fixtures and plumbing supplies. It was Jan. 3, 2004, either a few minutes before the 11 p.m. curfew or a few minutes after. Later on, no one would agree.
 The soldiers who flagged down the two Iraqis had just begun an especially perilous few days of duty. Samarra, an angry Sunni city, had slipped from American control. Sassaman's men, known for their exceptional aggressiveness, had been sent to take it back.
 By this time, the Iraqi insurgency was in full bloom. The holy month of Ramadan, beginning in October 2003, had coincided with a surge in attacks and American combat deaths. The insurgents were acting with greater sophistication every day, shooting down American helicopters, mortaring American bases, even firing rockets at Paul Wolfowitz, then the deputy defense secretary. In Samarra, the guerrillas had made so much mayhem that the American unit in charge of the town had abandoned its bases.
 The emergence of the Iraqi insurgency stunned senior American commanders, who had planned for a short, sharp war against a uniformed army, with a bout of peacekeeping afterward. Now there was no peace to keep. In response, American officers ordered their soldiers to bring Iraq back under control. They urged their men to go after the enemy, and they authorized a range of aggressive tactics. On a visit from his headquarters in Tikrit, Maj. Gen. Raymond Odierno, the commander of the Fourth Infantry Division, ordered Sassaman and other officers simply to ''increase lethality.'' Sassaman, adored by Odierno for the zeal with which his men hunted down guerrillas, took the order to heart. He sent his men into the Sunni villages around Balad to kick down doors and detain their angry young men. When Sassaman spoke of sending his soldiers into Samarra, his eyes gleamed. ''We are going to inflict extreme violence,'' he said.
 On the night of Jan. 3, the American soldiers approached Marwan and Zaydoon with caution. The curfew then in force throughout much of Iraq was supposed to help in separating insurgents from ordinary Iraqis. Anyone caught on the streets after the appointed hour was assumed to be a guerrilla. At the very least, any such person would be detained; if he acted aggressively, he would be killed. The truck driven by Marwan and Zaydoon was a white Kia pickup, known as a ''bongo truck,'' the same type commonly used by insurgent mortar teams. Marwan, a 24-year-old studying to be a math teacher, and Zaydoon, a 19-year-old engaged to be married, often traveled to Baghdad to buy parts and supplies that couldn't be had in Samarra. It was a way to make money in the anarchic postwar Iraqi economy.
 After a thorough search of the truck, the enlisted men in the platoon satisfied themselves that neither man was an insurgent. As best the soldiers could determine, their car had broken down on the way from Baghdad, and they had stopped to repair it. They were racing to beat the curfew when the Americans pulled them over. Still, it was difficult to know for sure. Like most Americans operating in Iraq, the platoon had no translator. Marwan and Zaydoon spoke no English. There were a lot of hand signals.
 ''Curfew! Curfew! Curfew!'' Specialist Ralph Logan pleaded.
 ''Baghdad! Baghdad! Baghdad!'' Marwan and Zaydoon replied. 
 At the time, the American soldiers were under strict instructions to detain anyone out after curfew, but they usually allowed themselves a little leeway. When, earlier that evening, a carload of Iraqis passed carrying a pregnant woman, the soldiers waved it through. Sgt. Carl Ironeyes, the squad's leader, told Marwan and Zaydoon they could go; he gave them as stern a warning as he could manage without knowing any Arabic. The Iraqis got into their truck and drove off.
 But as the two men pulled away, an order came over the radio from the platoon's officer, Lt. Jack Saville, still nearby in his Bradley personnel carrier, to stop the men again and detain them. The soldiers flagged down the truck once more and, according to procedure, cuffed the hands of Marwan and Zaydoon and put them on the floor of their Bradley. The soldiers from Alpha Company's first platoon did not take Marwan and Zaydoon to their base, as they were supposed to. Instead, Saville ordered the platoon to take a detour, to a bridge that runs atop the Tharthar Dam, a mammoth steel barrier that spans the Tigris River just outside of town. Marwan and Zaydoon were ordered out of the Bradleys, and the soldiers cut their cuffs. The water lay 70 feet below.
 ''Are you crazy?'' Staff Sgt. Tracy Perkins asked Saville.
 After some discussion, Saville agreed to a different spot, a place on the riverbank just beneath the bridge. He ordered a squad of five soldiers to take Marwan and Zaydoon down the trail that led from the road past a pump house to the river bank. This time, the drop was about 10 feet. The moon was high; the water, green and dark.
 Marwan and Zaydoon stood on the bank. The soldiers motioned with the guns.
 ''Jump,'' one of them said.
 When I first met Nathan Sassaman in October 2003, he and his men were already deep into the Iraqi enterprise. Sassaman had taken command of the Fourth Infantry Division's 1-8 Battalion in June, and although, like most American officers, he had received virtually no training in building a new nation or conducting a guerrilla war, he had quickly figured out what he needed to do: remake the area's shattered institutions, jump-start the economy and implant a democracy, all while battling an insurgency that was growing more powerful by the day. ''It's like Jekyll and Hyde out here,'' Sassaman said at the time. ''By day, we're putting on a happy face. By night, we are hunting down and killing our enemies.''
 In one 24-hour period I spent with Sassaman, he began the day presiding over a meeting of the Balad City Council, shepherding the Iraqis through the rudiments of democratic rule. Later, he led about 150 of his men on house-to-house searches for insurgents in a Sunni village outside of town. Then he drove into the countryside to dole out money to tribal leaders to help them with mosque repairs. That night, his post came under mortar attack, and Sassaman was first out the door, racing to his Bradley to hunt down the guerrillas. At 2 a.m., he finally lay down on his cot for what turned out to be four hours of sleep. He never took his boots off.
 It was an astonishing performance. On that warm October day, Sassaman seemed to embody not just the highly trained, highly educated officer corps that the American Army had brought to Iraq but also the promise of the American enterprise itself. Tough, witty and relentless, Sassaman was one of those people who seemed to take command by walking into a room. He had been an A student in Portland, Ore., earning appointments to both West Point and the Air Force Academy, and was recruited by Princeton as well. As Army's quarterback in the 1984 season, he helped to transform what promised to be another disappointing year into one of the school's best, taking the team to an 8-3-1 season. That year included victories over Navy, in which Sassaman ran for 154 yards and two touchdowns, and over Michigan State in the Cherry Bowl. For much of the season, Sassaman played with three cracked ribs. ''That's the kind of leader he was,'' says his coach, Jim Young.
 In Iraq, Sassaman produced moments that seemed to justify a cautious optimism: that from this broken and brutalized land, with a generous American hand, a more humane and more ordinary society might be coaxed to life. One of those moments unfolded at a meeting of the newly formed Balad City Council, which Sassaman had worked hard to bring to life. Seated at a table inside the Balad Youth Center, an Iraqi man called out the names of the council members, and one by one, they walked to the front of the room and stood before their constituents. As a predominantly Shiite city, Balad had felt the jagged edge of Saddam Hussein's rule, and the council members looked older than their years. Yet there they were, standing erect in their shabby clothes before a quiet round of applause.
 ''I won an election without threats or intimidation,'' one of them, a 43-year-old farm owner named Hussein Ali, declared after the meeting. ''The people know me in this town. I've pledged to do my best for them, to improve city services.''
 With a master's degree in public administration from the University of Washington and a number of unusually bright junior officers around him, Sassaman was better prepared than many of his comrades. But for the most part, when it came to nation-building or waging a counterinsurgency campaign, Sassaman was basically winging it. For starters, his men were spread incredibly thin. With roughly 800 soldiers, his battalion was responsible for nearly 750 square kilometers, some 300 square miles. There were Sunnis and Shiites, cities and farms, Sufis and Salafis. There were villages, like Abu Hishma, that sheltered die-hard supporters of Hussein, and cities like Balad, where the survivors of Hussein's regime wandered about as if just unstrapped from the torturer's table, which some of them were.
 There were no Army manuals on how to set up a local government in a country ruined by 30 years of terror, no maps for reading the expressions on the face of a Sunni sheik, no advice on handling the city engineer who was taking bribes to dole out electricity. American money for public-works projects, so critical in showing good will and putting young men to work, came in bursts and then dried up. Projects began; projects stalled. Lt. Col. Laura Loftus, who commanded a combat engineer battalion in Dujail, a city just south of Sassaman's area, recalled that when she arrived in July 2003, she found herself responsible for a city of 75,000 people in a state of complete physical and psychological collapse. Dujail was receiving four hours of electricity every third day, and half the town had no drinking water. Sewage drained through the streets. Thousands of Dujail's people had been murdered or tortured by Hussein's men. ''It was a good thing I paid attention in high-school civics,'' she told me. ''There was no playbook.''
 Sometimes Sassaman's efforts in Balad approached the absurd. When he wanted to set up a police force, no one in his battalion had the slightest idea of what this would entail. His men asked around, and it turned out that a reservist who was attached to Sassaman's battalion had brought an operations manual with him from the Tiverton, R.I., Police Department. Soon the Balad Police Department was functioning remarkably like its counterpart in a New England village. When Sassaman decided to hold an election, some members of the civilian leadership in Baghdad thought he was pushing too fast. Sassaman and his men forged ahead anyway, registering 45,000 voters. He finally received permission by agreeing to call the balloting a ''selection,'' not an ''election.''
 His power was very nearly total. He could chart the future of a city, lock up anyone he wanted and, if trouble arose, call in an airstrike. When he walked into a crowd, the Iraqis would sometimes smile and sometimes tremble, and sometimes both.
 ''For a whole year,'' Sassaman told me, ''I was the warrior king.''
 For all the intensity of the war in Iraq, one of the most remarkable things is how little American generals prepared the Army to fight it. When Sassaman and his men arrived in Iraq, they were ready to fight World War II or the first gulf war, but nothing as murky as a guerrilla insurgency. (''I wish there were more people who knew about nation-building,'' Sassaman told me one night. ''Don't they have those people at the State Department?'') Despite the experience of the Vietnam War, the American Army has continued to devote most of its resources to preparing for a conventional conflict: deploying a big, uniformed army to destroy another big, uniformed army. In the months before they went to Iraq, soldiers with the 1-8 Battalion traveled to the National Training Center at Fort Irwin, Calif., where they took part in a colossal war game against a mock enemy army, the ''Kraznovians,'' modeled on the Iraqi Army.
 But as a consequence of its overwhelming power and prowess, the American Army is not likely to face an enemy similar to itself. It is more likely to face guerrillas. Guerrilla wars typically begin when a smaller army is confronted by a larger one, forcing it to turn to the advantages it has: its ability to hide amid the population, its knowledge of the local terrain, its ability to mount quick and surprising attacks and then melt away before the larger army can strike back. This is more or less the case in Iraq, as it was in Vietnam, yet the leadership of the American Army is still wary of preparing the bulk of its troops to fight a guerrilla war. Most American soldiers are trained to use maximum force to destroy an easily identifiable enemy. Waging a counterinsurgency campaign, by contrast, often requires a soldier to do what might appear to be counterproductive: use the minimum amount of force, not the maximum, so as to reduce the risk of killing civilians or destroying property. Co-opt an enemy rather than kill him. If necessary, expose soldiers to higher risk. In the American Army, that sort of training is mostly relegated to forces like the Green Berets, who account for a small percentage of the Army's manpower.
 ''It's a chronic problem that runs deep in the DNA of the Army,'' says John Waghelstein, a retired colonel in the Special Forces who helped to conduct the American-backed counterinsurgency campaign in El Salvador. ''The Army has never taken counterinsurgency seriously. The Army's doctrine hasn't changed since the 1840's.'' At the Army's Command and General Staff College in Fort Leavenworth, Kan., attended by all American officers hoping to rise above the rank of major, students must pass a rigorous program consisting of roughly 700 hours of instruction. Of that, not a single required course focuses on how to fight guerrilla wars. 
 Waghelstein says that the Army's leaders actually decided to de-emphasize counterinsurgency following Vietnam. When Waghelstein was an instructor at the Command and General Staff College, the school eliminated several courses that dealt with guerrilla war or turned them into electives, he says. Kalev Sepp, a retired Special Forces officer and a counterinsurgency adviser to the American command in Iraq, told me: ''It's a cliche that the Army is always fighting the last war, but with the American Army, that's not true. When the Vietnam War ended, the Army tried to pretend it never happened. The typical officer in the military knew far more about the Battle of Gettysburg than he did about Vietnam. Initially, in Iraq, they were just making it up.'' 
 Instructors at the staff college defend its curriculum, saying they were trying to train American commanders to adapt to a range of circumstances, including insurgencies. ''It is a very uncertain world,'' says Col. Tom Weafer, director of the Staff College at Ft. Leavenworth. ''We try to prepare our officers to be comfortable with uncertainty.''
 That may be, but the soldiers of the 1-8 Battalion were prepared for a very specific fight: they expected to sweep south from Turkey with the rest of the Fourth Infantry Division and confront Saddam Hussein's army. There was no mention of setting up police departments, rebuilding sewage systems, registering voters. There were no plans for a guerrilla war. ''They told us, 'We're not going to be doing any of that Delta Force garbage,''' Sergeant Perkins told me. But the Turkish Parliament refused to allow its country to be a springboard. The division entered the Sunni Triangle from the south, after the invasion was over. Sassaman's men quickly found that the war was not only still going on but also unfolding in a way they had not anticipated.
 As Gen. Ricardo S. Sanchez, the top commander in Iraq until July 2004, told John F. Burns, a reporter for The New York Times, in June 2004: ''In May 2003, the general attitude was that the war was over. But within a matter of days, we began to realize that the enemy was still out there.'' Odierno, the commander of the Fourth Infantry Division, told me that the differences between conventional and guerrilla war are exaggerated and that, in any case, his men were well prepared to fight the Iraqi insurgency. But he conceded that they had crossed the Atlantic expecting a very different battle than the one they got.
 ''Our mission changed,'' Odierno said. ''We had to adapt.''
 In late November 2003, I drove with a photographer to Sassaman's base as the Iraqi insurgency was gathering force. As we wound our way down a country road, we spotted Sassaman and a handful of his men standing on the roadside, gathered round an Iraqi man. It was an interrogation.
 ''If you weren't here with your camera, we would beat the [expletive] out of this guy,'' one of the soldiers said. He may have been bluffing, but he was clearly frustrated. Sassaman seemed a harder man, too, though it had been just a few weeks since he was swearing in the City Council and his men were playing soccer with the locals. Beginning in October, the Iraqi insurgency had taken off. The American command decided to lift the curfew in many Iraqi cities to coincide with the arrival of Ramadan, the Muslim holy month. Sassaman went further, setting up a tent and inviting local tribal leaders to announce a ''cease-fire.'' As long as his men did not come under attack, Sassaman told the sheiks, he would ease off from offensive operations.
 The gesture drew two sharply different responses. By consequence of geography, Sassaman presided over the two leading realities of modern Iraq, Shiite and Sunni. In the area under his command, the Shiites were concentrated in Balad, and the Sunnis lived in the villages outside. The Shiites, largely receptive to the American occupation, saw the lifting of the curfew as an act of good will; in the Sunni areas, the insurgents saw an opportunity to assert themselves. Across the Sunni Triangle, violence exploded.
 Over time, Sassaman found that virtually every aspect of his patch of Iraq had that yin-yang quality. Where the Shiites appreciated American efforts to quell the violence, Sunnis saw them as acts of war. While self-government took hold in Balad, in the Sunni areas there was cold apathy. In Abu Hishma, a Sunni village of about 7,000, the Americans were met with stares and obscene gestures; even the adults would run their fingers across their necks as the soldiers drove by. Slogans on the walls exhorted Iraqis to kill Americans. Crowds of young men would gather to throw rocks at American patrols. And then there were the armed attacks.
 The divisions reinforced themselves. Sassaman directed most of his reconstruction money, nearly $4 million, to the Shiite areas for the simple reason that his men did not come under attack there. When the Americans entered Abu Hishma, it was seldom to build schools or roads; it was to patrol for insurgents and kick down doors.
 I accompanied Sassaman and his men on one search through a Sunni village in October 2003, and I was able to witness the dynamic on my own. The searches seemed absolutely necessary, given the violence, but they seemed to be draining whatever good will the Sunnis had left for the Americans. In one dawn raid, soldiers from the 1-8 Battalion surrounded a house, kicked open its doors and stormed inside. They rousted 11 men from their beds, pulled them outside and forced them to squat on their haunches. Still inside, in the living room, a young woman stood with three small girls, probably her daughters, each with her hands high in the air. The Americans found no weapons. The Iraqi men squatted outside for half an hour. ''I feel bad for these people, I really do,'' Sgt. Eric Brown said that morning. ''It's so hard to separate the good from the bad.''
 On the night of Nov. 17, as one of the battalion's patrols moved past Abu Hishma, a crowd of young Iraqis began taunting them. Seconds later, a team of insurgents fired a volley of rocket-propelled grenades directly at one of the Bradleys. One rocket-propelled grenade, or R.P.G., sailed directly into the chest of the driver, Staff Sgt. Dale Panchot. It nearly cut him in half.
 The death of Panchot seemed to change everything for the battalion. Sassaman decided that the Sunni sheiks had broken the truce and that from that moment there would be no more deals. Building a democracy in places like Abu Hishma would have to take a back seat. The new priority would be killing insurgents and punishing anyone who supported them, even people who didn't.
 The day after Panchot was killed, Sassaman ordered his men to wrap Abu Hishma in barbed wire. American soldiers issued ID cards to all the men in the village between the ages of 17 and 65, and the soldiers put up checkpoints at the entrance to the town. Around the camp were signs threatening to shoot anyone who tried to enter or leave the town except in the approved way. The ID cards were in English only. ''If you have one of these cards, you can come and go,'' Sassaman said, standing at the gate of the village as the Iraqis filed past. ''If you don't have one of these cards, you can't.''
 As a measure intended to persuade the Iraqis to cooperate, wrapping Abu Hishma in barbed wire was a disaster. As they lined up at the checkpoints, the Iraqis compared themselves with Palestinians, who are sometimes forced to undergo the same sort of security checks and whose humiliations are shown relentlessly on television screens across the Arab world. ''It's just like a prison now,'' said Hajji Thamir Rabia, an old man in the village. ''The Americans do night raids, come into our houses when the women are sleeping. We can't fight them. We don't have any weapons.'' After Abu Hishma was wrapped in barbed wire, the attacks against the Americans dropped off, but it was a victory bought at no small price. Much of the village felt humiliated and angry, hardly the conditions for future success. Sassaman's reputation was sealed, as I discovered when I slipped past the guards and into the town. ''When mothers put their children to bed at night, they tell them, 'If you aren't a good boy, Colonel Sassaman is going to come and get you,''' an old man in the village said.
 After a time, the insurgents came to fear him more than they did the others. When Sassaman left Balad, the attacks would increase; when he returned, they would fall away. Once, when Sassaman was returning from a mission in Samarra, insurgents fired a single mortar round into his compound, as if to welcome him back. He responded by firing 28 155-millimeter artillery shells and 42 mortar rounds. He called in two airstrikes, one with a 500-pound bomb and the other with a 2,000-pound bomb. Later on, his men found a crater as deep as a swimming pool.
 ''You know what?'' Sassaman told me. ''We just didn't get hit after that.''
 Yet the experience in Abu Hishma and the other Sunni towns posed a basic challenge for Sassaman's men: apart from killing insurgents, how could the Americans ensure that their authority would be respected and that they would be obeyed in a place where they were so thoroughly hated? In Sunni towns like Samarra and Abu Hishma, even the ones wrapped in barbed wire, the Americans found that if they were not being shot at, they were being challenged, and not just by small handfuls of villagers but by nearly everyone. Young men hurled rocks at American patrols. Adults stayed out past curfew. People scrawled graffiti exhorting their neighbors to kill American soldiers. Some of the resistance was passive: whenever American soldiers showed up in a Sunni village looking for insurgents, the locals, more often than not, just stood and shrugged. And some Iraqis, though not actually shooting at the Americans, were clearly cooperating with the insurgents. When Sassaman's soldiers would go on a patrol through a Sunni area, for instance, they might see a man on a rooftop a hundred yards away, unarmed and in street clothes, watching them go by. Farther down the road, another Iraqi might be standing off to the side, looking at his watch, marking the time of the convoy's pass. The myriad acts of defiance signified the steady erosion of American authority. And they led to the death of American soldiers. ''If I don't do anything when the guy flips me off, then the next time I drive by there I'm going to catch an R.P.G.,'' Perkins said. 
 In other countries where American authority has been challenged, soldiers have come to rely on ''nonlethal force.'' In places like Kosovo, American soldiers have threatened to cut off the electricity to restive neighborhoods. They have lectured the parents of many unruly teenagers. In Iraq, American officers relied on a panoply of nonlethal measures to help control the Iraqis. Col. Dana Pittard, who commanded some 3,000 American troops in the mixed Sunni-Shiite area of Baquba until earlier this year, said that when a young Iraqi made an obscene gesture to an American soldier, his men typically took the child home and scolded his parents. When men threw rocks, the Americans went to the local sheik and threatened to cut down palm groves.
 Pittard's tactics were so successful in engaging the Sunni population that, in the run-up to the January elections, Sunni leaders in Diyala Province asked a group of influential clerics to give the area's Sunnis permission to vote. In Baquba, in contrast to nearly everywhere else in Iraq, Sunnis cast ballots in large numbers. ''War is more than just killing people,'' Pittard said. ''We were trying to gain the trust and confidence of people.''
 Under the prodding of the generals, Sassaman took the concept of nonlethal force to its limits. His theory was that no progress would be possible without order first and that ultimately, even if his men were hard on the locals, they would come around. When his men came under fire from a wheat field, Sassaman routinely retaliated by firing phosphorous shells to burn the entire field down. The ambush site would be gone, and farmers might be persuaded not to allow insurgents to use their land again. 
 Sassaman detained Sunni sheiks, holding them responsible when his troops were attacked. When Iraqis gave him bad intelligence, he detained them too. When locals scrawled graffiti on a wall, denouncing President Bush or calling on the Iraqis to kill Americans, Sassaman asked local leaders to paint it over, and if they did not, he ordered his men to destroy it. If kids threw rocks, his men threw rocks back. If they caught an Iraqi man out after curfew, they piled him into a Bradley, drove him miles outside of town and told him to walk home. ''All I was getting at was, If grown-ups throw rocks at me, we're throwing them back,'' Sassaman said. ''We are not going to just wave. We are not driving by and taking it. Because a lot of the units did.''
 On a mission in January 2004, a group of Sassaman's soldiers came to the house of an Iraqi man suspected of hijacking trucks. He wasn't there, but his wife and two other women answered the door. ''You have 15 minutes to get your furniture out,'' First Sgt. Ghaleb Mikel said. The women wailed and shouted but ultimately complied, dragging their bed and couch and television set out the front door. Mikel's men then fired four antitank missiles into their house, blowing it to pieces and setting it afire. The women were left holding their belongings.
 ''It's called the 'leave no refuge' policy,'' Mikel later explained to Johan Spanner, a photographer working for The New York Times.
 That same winter in Samarra, Sassaman's men moved through a hospital and pulled a suspected insurgent from his bed. When a doctor told the Americans to leave, a soldier spat in his face. Another time, an officer told Spanner, one of Sassaman's soldiers threw a wounded man into a cell and threatened to withhold treatment unless he told them everything he knew. ''We've told him he's not getting medical attention unless he starts to talk,'' Capt. Karl Pfuetze told Spanner. The man's fate was unknown. (Pfuetze now denies the withholding of treatment. Sassaman insists he never condoned beatings or denial of medical treatment.)
 The best explanation for such tactics was offered by an officer in the Fourth Infantry Division. Echoing the private comments of many American officers, he said that the Iraqis seemed to understand only force. ''To an American, this might upset our sense of decency,'' he added. ''But the Iraqi mind-set was different. Whoever displays the most strength and authority is the one they are going to obey. They might be bitter, but they obey.''
 Among the enlisted men in Sassaman's unit, one of them, Specialist Ralph Logan, had demonstrated his misgivings about the rough tactics. Logan, 26, was sometimes chided by his peers for the delicacy with which he searched Iraqi houses, carefully pulling blankets out of closets and folding them into piles, while his comrades flung everything onto the floor. ''People didn't exactly get beaten up,'' Logan said. ''They got slapped around, roughed up, usually after they were detained. It was gratuitous. Sassaman didn't do it, but he definitely knew about it. He definitely condoned it.'' 
 But most of the tactics employed by Sassaman's men had been explicitly ordered or at least condoned by senior American officers, and many units in the Sunni Triangle were already using the same kind of tough-guy methods. The order to wrap Abu Hishma in barbed wire, for instance, was given by Col. Frederick Rudesheim, Sassaman's immediate supervisor. Odierno signed off on the wrapping of Saddam Hussein's birthplace, Awja. Destroying homes and detaining people as quasi hostages -- those, too, were being condoned by American generals. At a news conference in November 2003, Sanchez, the top commander in Iraq, acknowledged that he had authorized the destruction of homes thought to be used by insurgents. That same month, American officers said they detained the wife and daughter of Gen. Izzat Ibrahim, a high-ranking member of Hussein's government who was still at large. The hope, they said, was that the women could lead them to Ibrahim. Asked at a news conference about the destruction of houses, Sanchez said, ''Well, I guess what we need to do is go back to the laws of war and the Geneva Convention and all of those issues that define when a structure ceases to be what it is claimed to be and becomes a military target.''
 When I spoke to him earlier this year, Odierno acknowledged that in the autumn of 2003 he ordered his commanders to kill more insurgents. He said he also encouraged the use of nonlethal force. But Odierno said he left it up to the lower-ranking commanders like Sassaman to determine what methods to use. ''I tried to give them overarching guidance,'' Odierno said of his battalion commanders. ''I would not get into those details.''
 At the same time Odierno was encouraging Sassaman to kill more insurgents, Rudesheim was often telling him to go easy. Rudesheim explained to Sassaman that his forceful ways risked alienating or even killing innocent Iraqis. He often denied Sassaman the use of mortars, particularly the ones with phosphorous rounds that could burn down fields. He prohibited Sassaman's men from smashing open the gates on the exterior walls of Iraqi homes during searches, insisting that the soldiers climb over the walls instead. 
 To Sassaman, Rudesheim was a desk man who didn't understand the needs of his men and didn't spend enough time in the field to find them out. ''Fred thought we were too aggressive, that all we needed to do was maintain the status quo,'' Sassaman told me. In an interview, Rudesheim, who is now at the Pentagon, suggested that Sassaman had exaggerated the differences between them. He said, for instance, that he had authorized the use of artillery ''all the time'' and only denied the use of phosphorous to burn down fields.
 As the tensions grew, Sassaman said he began to ignore Rudesheim's orders altogether. Sassaman said he was relying on the assumption that Odierno backed a more aggressive approach. ''Ray is saying, 'Kill, kill, kill,''' Maj. Robert Gwinner, Sassaman's deputy, recalls. ''And Rudesheim is telling us to slow down. It drove Nate crazy.''
 The tough tactics employed by Sassaman's battalion had their effect. Attacks in the Sunni villages like Abu Hishma, wrapped in barbed wire, dropped sharply. And his men succeeded in retaking Samarra. Winning the long-term allegiance of the Iraqis in those areas was another matter, however. If many Iraqis in the Sunni Triangle were ever open to the American project -- the Shiite cities like Balad excepted -- very few of them are anymore. Majool Saadi Muhammad, 49, a tribal leader in Abu Hishma, said that he had harbored no strong feelings about the Americans when they arrived in April 2003 and was proud to have three sons serving in the new American-backed Iraqi Army. Then the raids began, and many of Abu Hishma's young men were led away in hoods and cuffs. In early 2004, he said, Sassaman led a raid on his house, kicking in the doors and leaving the place a shambles. ''There is no explanation except to humiliate,'' Muhammad told me. ''I really hate them.''
 In retrospect, it is not clear what strategy, if any, would have won over Sunni towns like Samarra and Abu Hishma. Crack down, and the Iraqis grew resentful; ease up, and the insurgents came on strong. As Sassaman pointed out, the Americans poured $7 million of reconstruction money into Samarra, and even today, the town is not completely under American control. 
 But there is another reason American commanders shy from using violence on civilians: the effects it has on their own men. Pittard, the American commander in Baquba, says that he was careful not to give his men too much leeway in using nonlethal force. It wasn't just that he regarded harsh tactics as self-defeating. He feared his men could get out of control. ''We were not into reprisals,'' Pittard says. ''It's a fine line. If you are not careful, your discipline will break down.''
 In most of the 20th century's guerrilla wars, the armies of the countries battling the insurgents have suffered serious breakdowns in discipline. This was true of the Americans in Vietnam, the French in Algeria and the Soviets in Afghanistan. Martin van Creveld, a historian at Hebrew University of Jerusalem, says that soldiers in the dominant army often became demoralized by the frustrations of trying to defeat guerrillas. Nearly every major counterinsurgency in the 20th century failed. ''The soldiers fighting the insurgents became demoralized because they were the strong fighting the weak,'' van Creveld says. ''Everything they did seemed to be wrong. If they let the weaker army kill them, they were idiots. If they attacked the smaller army, they were seen as killers. The effect, in nearly every case, is demoralization and breakdowns of discipline.''
 One such moment may have come in January 2004, when Mikel and his men, on the same day they destroyed the women's home, asked a group of about 10 Iraqi men to help them find someone. According to Johan Spanner, the photographer, the men shrugged and told Mikel that they didn't know anything. Mikel and his men told the Iraqis to do push-ups. ''Do this,'' one of the Americans said, getting down on the ground to demonstrate. So the Iraqi men got down on the ground and started doing push-ups, and the American soldiers stood around and laughed.
 It was around this time that soldiers in the 1-8 started getting people wet. It seemed to work so well the first time they tried it, in December 2003, when the men from Alpha Company's first platoon were driving their Bradleys toward the Balad airfield, and an Iraqi man, standing in front of his auto repair shop, raised his hand in an obscene gesture. On the way back, the Americans stopped and searched the shop but found nothing. Lt. Jack Saville, the platoon commander, told his men to take the Iraqi to a pontoon bridge that ran across the Tigris and throw him into the river. 
 ''The next time I went back, the guy is out there waving to us,'' Perkins said. ''Everybody got a chuckle out of that.'' Perkins said that he never told his superiors about what they did.
 In interviews and court testimony, Sassaman and the battalion's other officers said that they were never told about the incident and never authorized the tactic. At most, some of them said, they might have discussed the practice in meetings, but only in a hypothetical way. ''We did not discuss putting the Iraqis in water as a deterrent for curfew violations,'' Sassaman's deputy, Gwinner, testified. ''But we recognized it from the battalion leadership that it indeed was within the scope of nonlethal force.''
 On the night of Jan. 3, as Marwan and Zaydoon came driving into Samarra, soldiers in the first platoon apparently decided to try the tactic again. Inside the Bradleys, Perkins's voice came over the radio.
 ''Somebody is going to get wet tonight,'' he said.
 Some of the soldiers in Perkins's platoon said later that they figured they would be tossing an Iraqi into the Tigris again. Perkins insisted that he was only talking about the likelihood that it would rain.
 When Saville ordered the five soldiers to take Marwan and Zaydoon down to the riverbank, four of the soldiers obeyed, but one of them did not: Logan. It wasn't that he feared Zaydoon and Marwan would be killed. But Logan knew the platoon was straying from its orders: to detain any Iraqis found outside after curfew. And he thought the Americans were going too far. 
 ''I kind of looked at it as higher schoolers picking on freshmen,'' Logan told me. ''Us being the seniors; the Iraqis being the freshmen.''
 He knew that by refusing a direct order, he was risking arrest. But his comrades, used to him being the oddball -- used to his folding blankets on house raids -- didn't insist. Sgt. Alexis Rincon told Logan to stand guard while the rest of them did their business.
 For the American soldiers, making the two Iraqis jump into the water amounted to a kind of fraternity prank. The Americans had taken the Iraqis to a spot with a short drop. They had removed the Iraqis' cuffs. The current below seemed tame enough. ''We cut the cuffs off because we weren't trying to hurt the Iraqis; we were just trying to teach them a lesson for being out after curfew,'' Specialist Terry Bowman testified later. But if it was a prank, Marwan and Zaydoon weren't going along. When Martinez told the men to jump, Marwan and Zaydoon began to beg.
 ''We were pleading with the American, 'Please, please do not do this,''' Marwan told me this past summer. Zaydoon grabbed onto one of the Americans and begged as well. It was clear the Iraqis weren't going to go in without a struggle. ''Once we got to the edge of the water, Sergeant Martinez had his weapon pointed at Zaydoon, and Specialist Hardin pushed him over,'' Bowman testified. ''When Zaydoon went off, Marwan walked forward and jumped.'' Marwan lurched so violently that he almost pulled Bowman in with him.
 The soldiers turned to go back to their Bradleys. Martinez stayed behind a little longer to make sure the two Iraqis weren't in any danger. Marwan, known by the soldiers as ''the fat guy,'' and Zaydoon, ''the skinny guy,'' appeared to Martinez to be on their way out. ''I didn't ever see both of the Iraqis get out of the water,'' Martinez testified later. ''I did see the chubby guy on the bank almost out, and the skinny guy was doing good treading water, and so Sergeant Rincon and I felt the guys would be O.K., so we left.'' But five other American soldiers said they saw two people either climbing out of the water or standing near the spot where the Iraqis had gone in.
 ''I was looking through my thermal sites toward the objects to my right when we were moving,'' Sgt. Tony Fincher, a gunner on one of the Bradleys, said at Perkins's trial, held at Ft. Hood, Tex. ''I did see two people coming out of the water there, because they're easily identifiable, because the heads glow because they're hot, the hands glow; clothing is easily seen.''
 Marwan tells a different story. When he plunged into the river, Marwan recalled, the frigid water enveloped his body and a swift current pulled him toward the gates of the dam, less than 50 feet downstream. ''I felt the water dragging me,'' he told me. ''I was thinking of Zaydoon. I was looking at him. The water was so cold. My feet never touched the bottom. I tried to save Zaydoon, but he slipped from my hands.''
 Marwan said that he would have drowned had he not grabbed hold of a tree branch hanging over the water. Marwan said he grabbed and pulled himself out, spent a few minutes looking for his cousin and then walked a few hundred yards to an Iraqi Army checkpoint. The next day, Marwan said, he found his white bongo truck where he had left it, run over and smashed.
 Now, more than a year later, Marwan said he still dreams of that night and of his cousin Zaydoon. He said he harbors no doubts about what the American soldiers were trying to do. ''They were trying to murder us,'' he told me. As he struggled to get out of the Tigris that night, Marwan said, he could hear the sound of laughter from the top of the bridge. At least one of the Americans remembered that, too. ''When they got back, they were chuckling about it,'' Logan said.
 Sassaman learned about the incident a few days later. If it was true that his men were throwing Iraqis into the Tigris, Rudesheim later recalled telling Sassaman, then all of the soldiers involved could be court-martialed. Although Sassaman didn't know it, the Army had already begun a criminal investigation.
 Still in Balad, Sassaman called his deputy, Gwinner, and told him to find out what had happened. The soldiers of the first platoon told Gwinner what they had done, but said that both Iraqis had climbed out of the water. To satisfy himself, Gwinner took the entire platoon to the place where the soldiers had pitched the Iraqis into the river. To test the depth of the water, Gwinner ordered Saville to jump in. Saville plunged in over his head, but after a couple of paddles, he stood in water no higher than his waist.
 Sassaman decided that if he tried to explain to Rudesheim what had happened -- that his men had indeed thrown the Iraqis into the water but that they had come out alive -- then Rudesheim would likely go ahead and arrest his men. Sassaman decided that throwing the Iraqis into the Tigris was wrong but not criminal and that publicizing it could whip up anti-American feeling. He decided Saville and the others had made a mistake that was better handled without arrests. ''I really didn't lie to anybody,'' Sassaman told me not long ago. ''I just didn't come out and say exactly what happened. I didn't have anything to gain by ordering a cover-up. There was no way I was going to let them court-martial my men, not after all they had been through.''
 The deception didn't last long. Perkins, Saville and the others had settled on a story that didn't mention the water. But after several hours of questioning from Army investigators, several of the soldiers confessed. Sassaman, on hearing that there was a criminal investigation, phoned Odierno to tell him the whole story.
 An Iraqi search party found a body on the 13th day, floating in a canal on the other side of the Tharthar Dam, a little more than a mile from where Marwan and Zaydoon had gone into the water. Marwan was there when the body was fished out.
 A yellowy videotape, shot by Zaydoon's family, shows family members hovering over a waterlogged cadaver in a shroud. The cloth is peeled back, revealing a wrinkly face. Then it is wrapped up again before the video goes dark. ''Focus on the eyes,'' a voice says. In keeping with Muslim tradition, Zaydoon's family buried the body the day it was found. Though no Americans examined the body, Rudesheim ordered the Fadhil family to be paid about $12,000 for the funeral and the smashed truck.
 But at Perkins's trial, defense attorneys argued that Zaydoon never died and that his funeral had been faked, probably at the behest of insurgents who wanted to use the incident to accuse the Americans of murder. ''I know that guy is still alive,'' Perkins told me. ''I was the last one to leave, and I saw two guys out of the water.'' A classified American intelligence report, introduced at Perkins's trial, reported that, according to confidential Iraqi informants, Zaydoon was alive and hiding in Samarra.
 This was not out of the range of plausibility: once before, American officers say, a high-value insurgent leader was discovered to have faked his funeral, while his comrades dumped the corpse of another guerrilla into the water. The corpse, shot in the face, could not be identified. The insurgent leader was captured later in Baghdad.
 ''I was told that Zaydoon was alive in Samarra by my most trusted Iraqi informants,'' Capt. Alexander Williams, an intelligence officer, testified at Perkins's trial. An American medical examiner testified that the body shown in the family's video had most probably been in the water only a few days, not the 13 that passed between the time Zaydoon went into the Tigris and when the corpse was found. If the body had been in the water for that long, the medical examiner, Elizabeth Peacock, said, then some of it would have been reduced to a skeleton. What remained would have turned green and black. ''I did not see any evidence that the body spent an extended period of time in the water,'' Peacock said.
 Finally, there was the question of how swift the river had been that night. Some of the soldiers said the current had been moderate. One soldier said that the water was so stagnant that a layer of scum floated on top. In an interview, Kareem Hamadi, the director general of water projects in Samarra, gave precise specifications about the strength of the current. Thirty-four of 36 water-control gates were opened the night of Jan. 3, he said. Among the open gates was the one next to the shore, which diverts the flow into the canal where the body was found. That first gate had been opened 34 inches, enough for a water flow of about 3,500 cubic feet of water per second. And probably enough for a body to pass through. The depth of the water was about 16 feet, Hamadi said. ''A water flow like that creates a very strong and very swift current,'' he added. ''Enough to drag a person through the dam.''
 Army investigators didn't buy the idea that Zaydoon was alive. They considered the intelligence report, which was drawn up by a member of Sassaman's battalion, to be faked. ''I personally believed that the whole chain of command was lying to me,'' Sgt. Irene Cintron, an agent with the Army's criminal investigation division, testified.
 The questions were never answered. In late 2004, as attorneys were preparing to try Perkins's case, investigators told the judge that it was too dangerous to send soldiers to the grave site to exhume the body. When the case was delayed to determine whether Zaydoon was still alive, lawyers told the judge that their principal confidential informants, contacted again, had refused to cooperate. Nizar al-Samarrai, an Iraqi lawyer and Zaydoon's uncle, shook his head when I suggested that his nephew might have survived his plunge into the Tigris. He repeated a proverb: ''The saddest things can make you laugh.'' 
 One paradox, which Sassaman and not a few others pointed out, was that the Americans could have shot Marwan and Zaydoon that night, and no American officer would have raised an eyebrow. Two young Iraqi men, in a nasty Sunni town, caught driving a pickup after curfew: Iraqi civilians have been killed for less. But in exploring the possibilities of ''nonlethal'' force -- an idea meant to spare Iraqis, not kill them -- the soldiers had crossed a line.
 But where is the line? How much more serious was it to throw an Iraqi civilian into the Tigris, which was not approved, than it was to, say, fire an antitank missile into an Iraqi civilian's home, which was? Where is the line that separates nonlethal force that is justified -- and sometimes very painful -- from nonlethal force that is criminal? At trial, attorneys for Perkins argued that their client should be spared in part because the Army did not adequately prepare its soldiers for the guerrilla war in Iraq. In the words of Joshua Norris, one of Perkins's lawyers, Sassaman's soldiers were operating in a ''doctrinal vacuum.'' The generals wanted higher body counts, and they wanted the insurgency brought under control, but they left the precise tactics up to the soldiers in the field.
 So what should American soldiers do when they find themselves in a town where almost everyone hates them? At the trial, the Army decided not to address those questions. This past January, a military jury, made up of soldiers from the Fourth Infantry Division, convicted Perkins of assault. Saville, who gave the order to throw the Iraqis into the water, pleaded guilty to the same charge. Perkins received a sentence of six months; Saville, 45 days. Given the unanswered questions about the body, the manslaughter charges fell away. Both men, in effect, were convicted not of killing Zaydoon but of pushing him and Marwan into the water. Of getting them wet.
 Logan, who refused to go down to the river that night, left the Army shortly after he returned to the United States last year, largely, he says, because he felt as if his comrades no longer wanted him around. Bowman and Rincon (who helped to push Marwan and Zaydoon into the river) also left the Army. Sassaman, Gwinner and Cunningham received written reprimands for impeding the Army's investigation; their careers were effectively ruined. Sassaman decided to retire. His last day was June 30.
 At Perkins's trial, Sassaman waved away the chance to apologize for what happened. Testifying for the defense, he scolded the jury for second-guessing one of his soldiers in the field. ''I never thought there was any criminal intent involved,'' Sassaman testified. ''It was a bad call. And while we're thinking about that, we can just talk about everybody making mistakes over there.'' The judge, Col. Gregory Gross, told Sassaman such comments were unnecessary. Indeed, the responsibility of American generals was not seriously discussed at the trial. 
 When I saw Sassaman in June, outside of Fort Carson, in Colorado Springs, he was still officially in the Army. But in every real way, he was gone. The reprimand, signed by Odierno, said that Sassaman's conduct had been ''wrongful, criminal and will not be tolerated.'' He had decided to retire and was using the last bits of his vacation to stay away. No one seemed to want him around anyway. Sitting in Starbucks in Colorado Springs, Sassaman professed no bitterness over his time in Iraq. It wasn't easy to believe him. ''They threw us under the bus,'' he said of the Army.
 Sassaman was entertaining a lot of job offers, and he was leaning toward coaching football. The money wasn't as good, but Sassaman said he was excited about the prospect of returning to football. 
 In a field not far away, some months before, Sassaman had presided over a ceremony for the men from the 1-8 Battalion who had received medals in Iraq. About 1,200 people turned out for the event. Sassaman pinned Purple Hearts and Bronze Stars on about 80 of his men.
 Sassaman earned a medal of his own in Iraq, a Bronze Star, awarded for valor, but it was not given to him on that day. In August 2003, when his patrol came under attack, Sassaman had braved machine-gun and R.P.G. fire to drag one of his wounded soldiers from his vehicle. Then he chased down the insurgents and killed them.
 Sassaman's ceremony lacked the fanfare of the earlier one. It was held about a month later in the headquarters parking lot. Sassaman and a few other officers were there, along with his commander, Rudesheim. The bleachers were empty. Rudesheim pinned the medal to Sassaman's uniform, on the upper left of his chest. Sassaman recalled thinking how strange it was that the man with whom he had clashed so many times in Iraq would be the man who awarded him a medal for bravery.
 ''More than anyone I know,'' Sassaman remembers his commander saying, ''you deserve this.''

BYLINE: By Paul Greenberg. 
Paul Greenberg is the author of the novel ''Leaving Katya.'' He is at work on a book about seafood and the ocean.

 BODY:
On a dank, cold morning this past March, full of wind and the gloom of the sub-Antarctic autumn, I stepped off the customs pier in the Falkland Islands port of Stanley and tried to board a pirate ship. The Elqui, a rusted-out heap flying the Guinean flag, sat impounded at the dock, her captain awaiting charges from the British territorial government of South Georgia Island. What had brought the Elqui and its 30-odd Indonesian, African and South American crew members to this remote harbor at the bottom of the world were Chilean sea bass, 13 tons of which now lay frozen below the ship's deck.
After a knock on the door, Capt. Christian Vargas emerged, stressed out and exhausted and stinking of tobacco, sweat and bait.
 ''I can't talk until the hearing,'' he said. 
 ''Who are the owners of the ship?''
 ''I can't talk about it.''
 And with that he slipped back into the pilothouse and struck up a conversation with his Spanish fishing master. 
 Despite an American-led ''Take a Pass on Chilean Sea Bass'' campaign, boycotts from celebrity chefs and strict legal quotas on the catch, Chilean sea bass still sells briskly in the United States for as much as $20 a pound -- nearly five times what it cost when it first appeared in U.S. markets in the 1980's. A whole animal may go for more than $1,000. In short, the Chilean sea bass is today one of the most valuable fish in the sea. It is therefore of little surprise that Captain Vargas and his crew were drawn to ply the skyscraper-size waves and mile-deep trenches of the South Atlantic for a little bit of booty. What is surprising is that they were caught red-handed and that a serious attempt was being made to punish them. 
 And the Elqui was not the only boat feeling the heat from sea-bass defenders that week. While Captain Vargas awaited his hearing, naval frigates on the other side of Antarctica were scrambling to confront a squadron of pirate vessels at the edge of Australian territorial waters. In fact, the Elqui's apprehension is just the latest clash in what may be the most ambitious crusade ever mounted to save a species of fish. From Chile to Argentina to the British-controlled islands of the South Atlantic and east to Africa and Australia, hundreds of scientists, undercover investigators and government agencies have joined forces to protect the last viable stocks of this slow-growing deep-water predator. 
 It may seem strange that so much effort is being focused on an animal that 25 years ago was known to only a handful of Antarctic scientists and that went by the ungainly name of Patagonian toothfish. But Chilean sea bass today have become the signature species in a battle of global proportions. Put in very blunt terms, the world is running out of fish. According to a study published in July in Science, marine species diversity has declined by 10 to 50 percent in the last half-century, and a 2003 report found that up to 90 percent of the populations of the ocean's major predators are gone. It is the thick-fleshed ''major predators'' -- cod, tuna and Chilean sea bass, to name a few -- that humans crave most. And though these collapsed fish stocks are increasingly being replaced on the market by aquacultured product, fish farming is still highly problematic and so far cannot come close to matching what the ocean produces on its own. What we are seeing now are the last desperate calculations over the undomesticated fish that remain. On one side of the equation, fisheries managers in places like the Falklands are trying to wall in their piece of the ocean, building ramparts of regulations to keep enough fish in the water to maintain a sustainable harvest. On the other side, ''illegal, unreported and unregulated'' -- or ''I.U.U.'' -- fishing boats like the Elqui are laying siege to those same waters and stealing the fish out from under their protectors. In some fisheries, the pirate haul may be four times the legal catch. The Chilean sea bass is the unlikely Helen in this undersea Trojan War. What happens to it as the siege plays out will inform what can be done to manage marine life. Ultimately it may determine whether we can keep on eating ocean fish, the last truly wild food on earth.
 Those on the fisheries-management side of the war insist that things are starting to go their way. They claim that a combination of satellite monitoring of fishing boats, tighter import controls and high-profile arrests have greatly reduced the pirate catch in the last three years. Indeed, just as the Elqui was being brought to dock, a corporate-nonprofit partnership called the Marine Stewardship Council was completing a study of the same waters where the Elqui was caught poaching and was on the verge of declaring the Chilean-sea-bass fishery of South Georgia Island ''sustainable.''
 But even after watching the impressive international marine-conservation machine in action and meeting with the scientists and regulators who had engineered the South Georgia success story, the question that had been bothering me all the way down the Chilean coast to the Falklands remained: Is this fish managed well enough to eat? 
 The idea of managing the sea is a relatively new one, largely because for most of fishing history, the difference between what humans needed and what the ocean could provide was so great that the concept seemed absurd. For fishers of days past the closest thing to a management policy consisted of finding a fish, learning how to catch it and then catching all of it. Daniel Pauly, the director of the Fisheries Center at the University of British Columbia and a noted expert on global fishing trends, cites the example of the earliest anglers, Stone Age peoples in Africa who eradicated a six-foot-long catfish 90,000 years ago and then moved on to another animal. ''This pattern,'' Pauly says, of fishermen ''exterminating the population upon which they originally relied, and then moving on to other species, has continued ever since.''
 For most of fishing history, this species trade-in scheme was not particularly problematic. The lost fish of the past, like the sheepshead (for which Sheepshead Bay in Brooklyn is named), are easily forgotten when another fish can take its place. But the loss that brought the Chilean sea bass to our plates in the 1980's was of a magnitude never seen before.
 With the slight lilt of his native France in his voice tinged by a quiver of indignity, Pauly points out that the sea bass's white, flaky, easy-to-cook flesh makes it an excellent substitute for what was once the most common table fish in the world. ''What it substitutes for,'' says Pauly, ''and what it is, is cod.'' As has been well documented in Mark Kurlansky's best seller ''Cod,'' the cod stocks of the North Atlantic fed the world for hundreds of years. International fleets plied the Grand Banks off Canada, procuring enough cod to support the slave economy of the Americas and the working classes of Europe alike. Fish populations held up through the First and Second World Wars. But in the 1970's the North Atlantic cod catches started declining, sending shock waves through the world's fishing nations. And in the 1980's, after North American and European countries tried to address the cod crash with sweeping, protectionist regulations, a new era of search-and-destroy fishing began -- one in which ships would travel to the farthest corners of the globe to find something else to catch. 
 Thanks to the free-market policies of the dictator Augusto Pinochet, southern Chile would end up being one of the first new territories to bear the brunt of the displaced international fleets. As part of what the Pinochet junta called the Apertura, or ''Opening,'' foreign trawlers were granted cheap access to the fertile waters of the Chilean continental shelf. Within a few years they began wiping out stocks of hake and other codlike fish, pushing local Chilean fisherman, known as los artesanales, off their traditional fishing grounds. With nowhere else to go but farther out to sea, los artesanales moved onto the abyssal waters of the continental slope. Bobbing around in small, brightly colored boats, they let their lines down farther and farther, all the way down into the Humboldt current, a frigid shunt of water that moves along the base of the Chilean continental slope at depths exceeding 5,000 feet. It was then that they began to haul out a strange fish they had never seen before.
 About the size of a German shepherd, the animal had an air of the prehistoric to it. Thick scales covered its body. It had large eyes, mounted near the top of its head. Those, combined with a set of sharp teeth jutting from an underslung jaw, gave it a kind of cross-eyed, Alfred E. Neuman grin. When the fishermen gutted them, they found their innards were as cold as the polar seas. Toothfish, it seemed, were using the Humboldt current to make their way from Antarctica up the Chilean coast. 
 And there were lots of them. So many that by working the Humboldt in the early 1980's, los artesanales carved out a unique niche for themselves. Unlike cumbersome international trawlers, los artesanales used simple chains of baited hooks that allowed them to fish extreme depths cheaply. At one point they even opened up an export market with traders in Southern California. In fact, the name ''Chilean'' sea bass hails from this period when toothfish were used as a replacement species for collapsed American fish like a West Coast favorite called California white sea bass. Consumers barely noticed the switch.
 But eventually the factory ships retooled for toothfish, and today, as is evidenced by the ramshackle barrios that ring port towns along the Patagonian coast, los artesanales can scrape only a meager living from the sea. Whereas local fishermen once caught close to two and a quarter pounds of toothfish per baited hook, now they get just three and a half ounces. And while los artesanales have played a significant part in overfishing toothfish, they understandably focus their blame on the industrial fleets. Particularly galling to them was the government auction of the especially productive toothfish waters south of the 47th parallel to the highest bidder, i.e., the international fishing consortia that drove los artesanales to toothfish in the first place.
 ''Everyone has taken advantage of the local fishermen,'' says Raul Gonzales, an extremely vocal artesanale I met in the port of Valdivia. ''This was an opportunity for the local fishermen to help themselves to create a real business. Because we were the ones who deserve the possibility. Not the people who got involved later.''
 But the cascading decline of fish species in the last quarter-century created a hunger for toothfish much greater than could ever be sated by Chile's artisinal fishermen. Striped bass, Atlantic halibut, redfish and others joined the codfish in a massive American marine population crash, and by the 90's all had sunk to new lows. And just as fish were tanking, desire for fish was soaring. The discovery of the omega-3 fatty acid and other health benefits of fish compelled new consumers to eat them. And today, as Daniel Pauly notes, ''there are far more people with enough money to buy seafood. And so in Europe, in America and in Asia, the demand is not traditional.'' Ultimately it has taken nontraditional foreign fish, like the toothfish, to meet this nontraditional demand. 
 The toothfish, however, possesses one specific quality that has made it the nontraditional fish of choice. Most fish we eat are equipped with an airtight organ called a swim bladder. By filling its swim bladder with air, a fish saves energy, letting the rising effect of gasses do the work of swimming up. The ancestors of the toothfish, however, were benthic fishes -- dedicated deep-water bottom feeders that never moved more than a few feet above the sea floor. As such, they lost the need for a swim bladder long ago, and it was soon crowded out by other organs in the fish's gut. 
 But eventually the direct predecessors of the Patagonian toothfish found it advantageous to rise off the bottom and hunt for prey in shallower water. Without a swim bladder to work from, the ur-toothfish needed to develop an alternate buoyancy device. Over time, glands developed under the fish's skin that secreted fats directly into its muscle tissue. Fats, being lighter than water, performed the same function as a swim bladder, lightening the animal and allowing it to rise from depths of 6,000 feet to as shallow as 200 feet with little effort. 
 This trait made the toothfish a very effective predator for millions of years. But when the modern human seafood diner evolved a taste for fish, the fat-as-flotation scheme made the toothfish into very desirable prey. Because when you secrete fat directly into your body, you are in effect giving yourself a deep-tissue marinade for your whole life. 
 All that fatty marinating, says the chef Rick Moonen (formerly of Manhattan's famed restaurants Oceana and the Water Club and one of the first to take Chilean sea bass off his menu, in 1999), made the fish ''great for a restaurant situation. Because of the margin of error you can overcook this fish by five minutes and it's still delicious.'' Recalling the days when he served it with abandon, Moonen calls toothfish a ''no brainer.. . .You can saute it, grill it, broil it, steam it, roast it -- you can do whatever you want to do with it.'' Indeed, throughout the booming 1990's, everyone -- hotel chefs, cruise-line caterers, trendy home cooks -- sought it out. (Even the elusive giant squid seems to have caught the toothfish craze -- recently a 12-footer attacked a haul of toothfish in the Ross Sea.) In 2001, Bon Appetit magazine declared it ''dish of the year.'' 
 This attention caused a worldwide toothfishing free-for-all. And though regulations have gradually come online in waters controlled by the different nations of the Southern Hemisphere, a large swath of the South Atlantic is still technically owned by no one, administered only by the voluntary Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources. For a pirate vessel, the temptation to dip back and forth between international and national waters to get as much toothfish as possible is large: in the wild waters of the Antarctic, the odds of getting caught are still quite low.
 Not low enough, however, for Captain Vargas of the Elqui, who was escorted into a Falkland Islands courtroom this past March 15. There beneath portraits of Queen Elizabeth and Prince Charles, the prosecutor, Rosalind Cheek, tried to trace the shadowy web of interests that financed the pirate captain's expedition to British-controlled South Georgia Island. 
 ''We had difficulty estimating who is the owner of this vessel, ma'am,'' Cheek said, addressing the judge with a formality that had an ''Alice in Wonderland'' quality to it so far from Britain's shores. ''The certificate of registration of the vessel relates to the country of Guinea,'' she continued. ''We place little weight on this document at all.'' Cheek then went on to describe a paper trail that named three different entities in three countries: Naton International in Belize; a lawyer in Vigo, Spain; and a Geneagles Company in Panama. And though the British Foreign Office paid a call on Geneagles's Panama City office, that investigation ''led to no trace of the company.'' 
 ''With respect to my friend,'' countered Richard Marlor, a local attorney who had been hired, shotgun-style, via a fax from Spain, ''the address given was for the law firm of Arias, Fabrega.. . .'' 
 The judge listened impatiently to Marlor's convoluted explanation of who or what Geneagles was until she finally broke in with an Australian-ish Falklands twang. ''I was hoping for something as simple as a document of ownership,'' she said. She then ordered Captain Vargas to surrender his Chilean passport and await trial. 
 The ownership and identity of fishing boats is a key issue that has been on the minds of everyone who has taken up the toothfish cause in recent years. For ever since toothfishing moved from a small-scale endeavor to an international enterprise worth millions of dollars, the fishing nations have been trying either to lay claim to the different populations of toothfish that ring Antarctica or at least to deny responsibility for the theft of them. 
 Nowhere is this desire to both protect the fish and gloss over its illegal exploitation more evident than in Chile. In the last five years, Chile has become one of the world's most active toothfish advocates, cracking down on the use of Chile's flag on questionable fishing boats. Even the name Chilean sea bass today perturbs most Chilean officials. While the Chilean-sea-bass label was once regarded as a clever marketing strategy, now the government sees it as a liability. ''We don't like 'Chilean sea bass,' '' Sergio Mujica, the director of Chile's National Fisheries Service, told me in his office in downtown Santiago. ''When you say, 'Chilean sea bass,' you are saying Chileans are fishing illegally, and I think that's not fair because I'm sure we're fishing legally.'' Given the opportunity, Mujica would get rid of the name altogether. ''I would change it,'' he told me. ''I would like to name it Patagonian toothfish or toothfish or whatever.'' 
 But Mujica's eagerness to dissociate Chile from the fish bearing its name belies a much more complicated history. As was the case with the artisinal beginnings of legal toothfishing, pirate toothfishing had much of its origins in Chile. After Pinochet left power in 1990 and the new government in Santiago began to regulate fishing more rigorously, Spanish-Chilean consortia started to look abroad for virgin stocks of toothfish. According to a report by the Chilean N.G.O. Ecoceanos and the Australian nonprofit International Southern Oceans Longline Fisheries Information Clearing House (known as Isofish), Pinochet's former under secretary of fisheries, Roberto Verdugo, led the way into these new waters. The Isofish report charges that Integracion de Actividades, one of Verdugo's many companies, ''organized the purchase and export of the first landings of illegally caught toothfish in Montevideo.'' Later, as populations of toothfish were found to exist elsewhere in the sub-Antarctic, the report continues, Verdugo set up fish-laundering operations in South Africa, Namibia, Mauritius and more recently China. At one point, Verdugo's enterprises were moving more than 30,000 tons of toothfish a year. And while Verdugo has reportedly stopped his toothfishing exploits, other operators in Uruguay and elsewhere have come on to take his place. The model for these operators is often the same: a hard-to-trace Spanish investor, a boat of questionable origin flying a ''flag of convenience,'' a cadre of ship's officers from Chile and a crew of impoverished, unskilled laborers gathered from the most desperate ports in the world.
 The chaotic situation of fish piracy has, however, caught the attention of environmentalists. Initially drawn to the toothfish by the large number of albatrosses and other seabirds that are often accidentally killed during pirate fishing, marine conservationists later came to see the toothfish as an ideal symbol for publicizing the larger problem of overfishing. Efforts began modestly with the Australian Isofish initiative, which ran campaigns against pirates in their hometown newspapers. Soon the movement spread to the United States, where the National Environmental Trust inaugurated its ''Take a Pass on Chilean Sea Bass'' campaign. Realizing that most toothfish were being served in ''white tablecloth'' restaurants, the trust infiltrated the U.S.'s top dining markets. ''What we would do,'' says Gerald Leape, a vice president of the trust, ''is we'd go in with organizers three months ahead of time and quietly talk to chefs and say: 'Listen, will you join us on this? Would you be willing to take it off your menu and not serve it for at least five years or until greater protections were in place?' '' And while Americans still eat a lot of toothfish, to Leape that is somewhat beside the point. ''We've at least raised the profile of it,'' he says, ''and now we want to use that profile and the people who agree with us to stress the larger problem of illegal fishing.''
 Thanks in large part to Isofish and the National Environmental Trust, those parts of the world trying to stop piracy and rationally manage toothfishing now go to great lengths to demonstrate good practices. It is for this reason that so much time and effort was being put into the trial of the Elqui. Shortly before last March's hearing, I dropped by the Falkland Islands Government House to discuss the ramifications of the case with Her Majesty's acting representative in South Georgia Island.
 A carefully spoken career foreign-service officer with short black hair and dark eyes, Harriet Hall was running one of Britain's most far-flung territories from a small office on Government House's ground floor. And though she knows how to say ''toothfish'' in well-inflected Mandarin (she was recently based in China), until last year she had barely dealt with fish at all. Nowadays, however, blustery winter afternoons will often find her standing on the Falklands customs dock, weighing illegally caught toothfish. It's perhaps these experiences that made her break from her staid diplomat's pose when I suggested that trying to sustainably manage South Georgia's toothfish in the pirate-infested South Atlantic could be an exercise in futile idealism, like managing in a bubble. 
 ''What's managing in a bubble?'' she said, leaning forward across a very orderly desk. ''Why should we lower our standards when we can maintain high standards here? We would like everyone to manage the toothfish fishery in the way that we do. We're trying to improve the standard of the fleet that fishes in South Georgia.'' 
 The British seem to believe that prosecuting pirates is extremely important not just for the toothfish but for all fish because of the way piracy undermines sustainable fishing everywhere. While fisheries management still ranks as one of the more imprecise sciences on earth, it is now possible to estimate the overall ''fishing effort'' being applied against a given species and to predict what toll that effort will take on a population. Regulators can then work backward to determine the number of vessels that should be permitted into the fishery and the total allowable catch (TAC) for a given season. 
 Licenses sometimes costing hundreds of thousands of dollars are issued to specific vessels for a portion of that TAC, with the goal of eventually keeping 40 percent of the historical fish population in the water. This 40 percent is the holy grail of fisheries management, for in most cases scientists have found that a population that is at 40 percent of its pre-exploitation biomass will remain stable over time. Pirate fishing ruins the whole equation, because when boats like the Elqui take fish out of an area like South Georgia without buying into the licensing system, they potentially eat into the 40 percent that is necessary to sustain the population in years to come. 
 For the British of the South Atlantic, arriving at a sustainable population is critical because of their goal of creating a recognizable, environmentally friendly ''brand'' of toothfish. In aid of this, a team of scientists has been deployed around South Georgia in recent years to conduct genetic testing and other research. After comparative analysis, the team determined that South Georgia toothfish are indeed a distinct, soundly managed stock. The Marine Stewardship Council, which was initially set up with financing from the international food conglomerate Unilever and the nonprofit World Wildlife Fund, accepted the South Georgian data and certified the fishery as sustainable. Harriet Hall sees this development as essential to building consumer confidence. ''One of the key ways to help prevent I.U.U. fishing is for consumers to be aware of the problem,'' Hall told me. ''Not for consumers to eat just all toothfish but to ensure that the toothfish is from sustainably managed stocks.'' This philosophy now pervades the legal toothfish trade. Nearly every legitimate toothfishing company I spoke with belongs to a group called the Coalition of Legal Toothfish Operators, which arrests pirate fisherman and sets standards for the industry. And as a result of pressure brought about by efforts like the Take a Pass on Chilean Sea Bass campaign, imports of Chilean sea bass to the United States must now carry certification indicating where, when and how each particular toothfish was caught. Several seafood importers I spoke with said that toothfish is now one of the hardest fish in the world to get past U.S. Customs.
 But seen against the background of historical overfishing, there is plenty of room for skepticism. The examples of fish populations being sustainably managed or restored are extremely rare. The New Zealand hoki fishery, another deep-water population certified by the Marine Stewardship Council, declined significantly last year, and the North Atlantic cod stocks are not recovering. And as some fisheries experts have pointed out, the goal of managing to achieve 40 percent of a fish population's historical biomass is based in part on speculation. In most fisheries, stocks have been subject to substantial fishing pressure before scientists get to study them. The estimation of ''historical biomass'' is therefore something of an educated guess.
 All of this causes scientists like Daniel Pauly of the U.B.C. Fisheries Center to take a dismal view of the future. ''I have no reason for optimism,'' he told me after I described South Georgia's progress with its toothfish. Over the years, Pauly has observed a kind of survival-of-the-fittest situation that allows overfishing to continue even after a hundred Elqui's are caught. ''What stays in are the very efficient operators,'' he said. ''They are very efficient either at fishing or very efficient at eluding the law or very efficient at getting subsidies or all three.. . .The overall fishing pressure continues to increase even though the number of boats might decrease.'' Pauly's theory is borne out in the difficulty prosecutors have in holding pirates accountable. The South Georgian authorities did eventually decide to dynamite the Elqui, sending her to the bottom of the ocean, never to poach again. But the owners of the ship were never found. The Elqui's $400,000 fine remains unpaid. Spanish conglomerates, some of which may serve as backdoor financiers of pirate ventures, continue to receive hefty fisheries subsidies from the European Union. And elsewhere, more and more untraceable vessels appear to be roaming the high seas. A report prepared for the World Wildlife Fund last year noted that the number of large-scale fishing vessels on the Lloyd's Register of Shipping whose flag is listed as ''unknown'' has grown by approximately 46 percent since 1999. 
 As for the toothfish, Dr. Pauly sees a fate for it similar to nearly every large marine predator that has come up against mankind. The toothfish ''will have spent a few years in the sun of the Marine Stewardship Council, and then it will go back to obscurity as a collapsed stock, and then we'll find something else.'' The only chance Pauly sees for the survival of fish stocks is to go beyond the framework of ''sustainable management'' and adopt a kind of crop-rotation system, where portions of the ocean would be allowed to lie fallow for long periods of time without any fishing at all. 
 If things continue as they are, Pauly foresees a future in which humans will gradually eat their way down the food chain or ''trophic levels'' of the ocean, taking out the higher predators like toothfish, white sea bass, halibut, cod and striped bass first, then moving on to smaller midlevel predators and eventually down to invertebrates like jellyfish and plankton. By some arguments this is already happening on the collapsed grounds of the Grand Banks. Whereas the Banks once supported the largest cod fishery in the world, it is now producing record numbers of snow crabs and other bottom-scavenging invertebrates.
 Look at the menus of today's top seafood restaurants, and it's clear, as Pauly predicted, that we have indeed found something else. Seldom will you see Chilean sea bass claiming the most elaborate sauce on the carte du jour. That spot is now reserved for the new fish of the moment -- branzino, orata, tilapia. But there is a critical difference between these fish and the toothfish that your waiter will not likely reveal. All of them are grown on fish farms. Seafood importers I spoke with say that an ever-increasing percentage of the fish they deal in are aquacultured. As we reach the end of the big natural predators, farmed fish will replace wild, just as beef cattle replaced buffalo. 
 Nowhere is this more evident than in Chile. Looking out the window of my flight back to Santiago, I could see the phenomenon taking place literally before my eyes. The Patagonian fjords, once pristine, now sparkle here and there with metal cages laid out in grids in the sapphire-blue water. Chile is now one of the largest producers of aquacultured salmon. So successful have the Chileans been that they are expanding their species repertory. The most recent aquaculture experiment happening is an attempt to breed toothfish in captivity. My calls to Fundacion Chile, the backer of this project, were not returned, but Chile's leading toothfish expert, Carlos Moreno, indicated there are significant hurdles. ''It needs a higher investment,'' Moreno says. ''It's impossible to find a male and a female ready to spawn at the same time.'' 
 Meanwhile, los artesanales, the local fishermen that continue to make their living from the Chilean coast, pursue the big predators like toothfish less and less frequently. Instead they are catching inch-long forage fish and other marine animals that are ground up and fed to farmed salmon.
 A consumer at this point might shrug and say: ''So what? Maybe it's better to eat farmed fish and let the wild fish roam free?'' The only problem with this argument is that every pound of aquacultured fish brought to market needs at least three pounds of wild little fish for forage. 
 ''Which means that Pauly's thesis is actually being pre-empted,'' says Isofish's founder, Alistair Graham. ''While one bunch of fishers is going down the trophic chain catching the bigger fish, there's another bunch of fishers that are taking out the food resource for the higher trophic orders.'' In other words, humans are figuring out a way to consume not only all of the ocean's predators, but all of its prey too. 
 And yet Felipe Sandoval, Chile's current under secretary of fisheries, is brimming with optimism. Looking out on a country whose economy is now the tiger of South America, roaring with an engine of aquacultured salmon, he sees the problem of feeding Chile's fish farms as a technicality that will be solved with human ingenuity. ''In a discussion with some ecologists some time ago, they gave me a tragic view of humanity in the future,'' the under secretary said on a sunny fall morning in Santiago. ''And I asked if they knew a man called Malthus. Malthus made a very tragic estimation about what would happen with this whole process. And yet, now, here we are. Technology and knowledge help to solve problems. And with fish the same thing will happen as with the earlier food debates. The amount of fish meal we have is not sufficient, but we will find something.''

HEADLINE: Adventure as a Team Sport

BYLINE: By LIANE PELLETIER; As told to Elizabeth Olson.

 BODY:
WHEN you grow up the last of five children, you spend a lot of time trying to keep up with your older siblings. But No.5 also gets more freedom, and that helped me become self-reliant at an early age.
 I was also very interested in sports, trying everything from rock-climbing to squash. Some of my keenest memories are of hiking along segments of the Appalachian Trail, and rappelling down to the water on the coast of Maine. 
As an adult, I have been able to indulge my passion for traveling and adventure. A few years ago, I went down the Amazon and stood in muddy waters filled with leeches to gather tropical fish. But my collecting days ended after that trip, when the bags containing my fish were accidentally left on an airport tarmac overnight, and froze.
 I got my undergraduate degree at Wellesley College, where, since I was surrounded by women, I lost -- if I had it -- any bias that only men are leaders. My professor of economics, Karl Case, with whom I still keep in touch, influenced me to choose economics as my major. He made each lecture as fun and interesting as watching a cooking show is to me now.
 After graduating from M.I.T.'s Sloan School of Business in 1984, I began working in management consulting on the East Coast. But I was interested in trying out a new part of the country, so I signed up with the Dallas office of Touche Ross, now Deloitte & Touche. Management consulting was great because it was so diverse, but then a headhunter called me about a job with Sprint, which was building its fiber optic network and was in the thick of exciting changes in the communications industry. I stayed for 17 years, beginning as a marketing manager and winding up as a senior vice president.
 When I was contacted about being chief executive of Alaska Communications Systems, Alaska's largest integrated telecommunications company, I was excited, but I hesitated, even though I loved the state when I went sea kayaking and hiking there in 2001. When I mentioned the job to my sister, she said: ''This is so you. Go do it.''
 So in October 2003, I moved to Anchorage and began remaking the company around the goal of earning each subscriber's business in every product category, whether it is local, long distance, wireless or Internet.
 Even though I've always been more interested in individual than team sports, I see myself now as coach of a large team, making sure all the players know their spots, that they rely on other team members to do their part and that a win is for all and not just for one person. It is perfectly clear to me that this is how a company succeeds, but I didn't learn this from team participation but somewhere else along the way.
 A hard thing about living in Alaska is how long it takes to fly to and from the state. It can take three and a half hours to reach Seattle, depending on the time of year and the wind. And that's before I set off for anywhere else in the country. 
 When I'm not working, I love to cook. Two of my brothers are chefs, and my sister and I trade recipes regularly. Now, one of my favorite things to cook is king salmon.
 Vying with cooking is my love of outdoor sports, but sports like hiking and snowshoeing require a lot of vigilance in Alaska. That's because, for example, if a hiker ahead of you irritates a bear or moose, that animal can retaliate against the next person, no matter how perfectly he or she is following wilderness rules.
 So one's keen observation skills need to be ''on'' at all times. And such well-honed skills can be useful in the business world.

HEADLINE: Tuesday's Buy May Become Friday's Sell

BYLINE: By CONRAD DE AENLLE

 BODY:
THIS could be a week of mood swings in the stock market, as traders react to a pair of measures of consumer attitudes.
 The first reading will come on Tuesday, when the Conference Board, a private research organization, issues its monthly report on consumer confidence. Economists polled by Bloomberg News predict a bounce in this widely followed measure to 88 this month from 86.6 in September, after the devastation caused by Hurricane Katrina. 
Three days later, the University of Michigan will release its own gauge of consumer confidence for October. The Bloomberg estimate calls for a modest rise to 76 from 75.4 a month ago.
 One consumer sentiment measure may seem like any other to the untrained investor, but Edward E. Yardeni, chief investment strategist at Oak Associates, says that subtle differences in the way the indicators are compiled can send stocks zigging and zagging.
 ''The Tuesday October confidence index will be very important because it will give us consumers' read on employment,'' he said, pointing out that the Conference Board survey includes questions for consumers on job opportunities. 
 The Michigan survey is more oriented toward spending habits, he said, and so ''it is a very good coincident indicator of consumer sales.''
 Mr. Yardeni said the numbers could suggest that people have a rosy view of the job market yet are still inclined to keep their money in their pockets. 
 ''Just because jobs seem to be increasing, it doesn't mean people are in the mood to spend,'' he said.
 If the reports come in as he expects, traders may be in a mood to buy stocks on Tuesday, then sell them on Friday.
 ''If we get a number Tuesday that supports the view that the economy is resilient and consumers are getting more optimistic,'' Mr. Yardeni said, ''then the market should respond well to that, especially if we get a good existing-home number.'' 
 Sales of existing homes will also be announced on Tuesday.
 ''Then, at the end of the week,'' he continued, ''if it seems that consumer spending remains depressed, there could be some profit taking.''

DATA WATCH -- A ''notoriously volatile number,'' as Mr. Yardeni described it, will be released Thursday in the monthly report on orders for durable goods -- those items, from household appliances to commercial jets, that are expected to last three or more years.
 Bloomberg's poll of economists estimates a decline of 1.2 percent for September after a 3.4 percent rise in August.
 The nation's economic output for the third quarter is scheduled to be reported on Friday, though the result is not expected to move the markets. An annualized growth rate of 3.6 percent is predicted, an increase of 0.3 percent.

A THOUSAND YEARS OF GOOD PRAYERS
 Stories.
 By Yiyun Li.
 205 pp. Random House. $21.95.
Yiyun Li was born in Beijing and moved to the United States in 1996, and in her accomplished first story collection she offers a subtle and original perspective on the latest chapter in China's turbulent history: its recent transformation from an inefficient Marxist dictatorship into one of the world's fastest growing economies. Many of the stories in ''A Thousand Years of Good Prayers'' are set in the 1990's, and Li is a valuable firsthand guide to this decade of mind-bending change. These narratives are about shifts and adjustments: parents make allowances for their children (and vice versa), and all her characters have to decide how to cope with the past -- both personal and political -- in order to stand a chance in an uncertain future. Li's ability to write about both her native and adoptive countries -- her characters include Chinese immigrants in America and emigres on return visits to China -- makes her a skillful double agent. The cross-cultural dispatches she delivers require rapid adjustments on the part of the reader, too. 
 Several stories explore the widening inequalities in the new China and the hypocrisy required to ignore them. In ''Extra,'' Granny Lin is ''honorably retired'' (a euphemism for being fired with no compensation or pension) from the state-run factory where she works. She can hardly believe her luck when she finds a job at a new private boarding school: ''Every meal is a banquet . . . Everything is produced by a small organic farm that serves the president and the premier and their families.'' The school's fees are far beyond the reach of most ordinary Chinese. In ''After a Life,'' Mr. Su, a retired schoolteacher, plays the stock market with money borrowed from Mr. Fong, a much wealthier friend. Mr. Fong remains a committed Marxist, but his wife is a government official who has been imprisoned for taking an enormous bribe.
 Li does more than simply provide a human face for a set of statistics. Her compassion for her own creations persuades us that they are worth caring for; the most selfish characters often turn out to be the most unhappy, their self-absorption a way of keeping up appearances. Yang, in ''The Princess of Nebraska,'' trained to be an actor in the Peking Opera. Now, thinking only of his lost career, he cares nothing for the men he leads on or the woman he gets pregnant. His obsession with the stage, however, seems no more unhealthy than the longing he inspires in others.
 China's traumatic 20th-century history is never far from the surface here. ''Immortality,'' the most ambitious story in the collection, takes us on a virtuoso tour through the end of the empire in China, the republic at war, the Communist and cultural revolutions. The collective first-person narrators, reminiscent of the bereaved neighborhood boys in Jeffrey Eugenides's novel ''The Virgin Suicides,'' are a striking symbol of endurance; like Eugenides's narrators they, too, outlive the subjects of their story.
 Li's sentences occasionally creak under the weight of the information they convey, as if the didactic urge to explain the China she knows pushes aesthetics out of the way: ''Boshen had come to America via false marriage to a friend five months earlier, when he had been put under house arrest for his correspondence with a Western reporter regarding a potential AIDS epidemic in a central province.'' But, for the most part, Li shows a light touch that, combined with her gift for characterization, saves her stories from turning into consciousness-raising exercises. In another story, Sansan, an English teacher in a small town, is known to her pupils as ''Miss Casablanca'' because she makes them watch it so often. Before she was jilted by her fiance she used to screen ''The Sound of Music'' instead: ''After the letter, she has never sung again. 'Casablanca' says all she wants to teach her students about life.''
 The parent-child relationships in this book provide a poignant commentary on the dislocation between modern China and its recent past. In ''Son,'' a successful software engineer, now living in America, visits his widowed mother back home. His attempts to undermine her new-found faith in Christianity -- he tells her he's gay -- and her imperturbability make us wonder who's the more adaptable character after all: ''Her god is just like a Chinese parent, never running out of excuses to love a son.'' The title story is an unhappy reversal of this situation; here increased Westernization widens the generation gap. Mr. Shi visits his divorced daughter in the Midwest, anxious to catch up on the conversations they failed to have during her childhood when he was too busy to answer her constant questions. After a lifetime of not talking, his daughter has nothing to say to him -- but he wouldn't understand her even if she did: ''A foreign country gives one foreign thoughts.'' 
 Yiyun Li is too realistic a writer to dispel the misunderstandings between her characters who soldier on, all too believably, in their stoical isolation. Self-pity is not an option for most of them, but as readers we can pity their predicaments and admire the refusal of their creator to simplify their lives.

BYLINE: By NEIL GENZLINGER

 BODY:
IF some of the young female characters in ''Human Trafficking,'' Lifetime's new mini-series about the sex-slave trade, seem to be compellingly drawn, it may be because Agatha Dominik, who wrote the script, understands where they come from, literally. Ms. Dominik grew up in Communist Poland, and she knows all about the frustration of living in a country with few opportunities and much deprivation -- conditions that still exist in the former Soviet bloc, leaving young women susceptible to the worst kinds of exploitation.
 ''I had this visceral empathy for those girls,'' Ms. Dominik said, ''because although the system has changed economically and politically, the dream of having a better life is still there.'' 
That dream leads several characters in ''Human Trafficking'' to make poor decisions -- one entrusts herself to a slick boyfriend; another thinks she is getting an opportunity to become a fashion model. Instead they end up prisoners, forced to work in brothels in the United States. 
 Ms. Dominik left Poland 18 years ago, before the Soviet system collapsed, but she said the lure drawing young women toward hidden dangers may be even stronger today, with images of Western prosperity now so predominant in places like Russia and the Czech Republic.
 ''Everything is available -- all the media, the goods -- but not available at the same time,'' she said. ''At least before, they didn't know; now they do, and they want to have it. It's a very human psychological problem.''
 ''Human Trafficking,'' broadcast in two parts on Monday and Tuesday nights, is as stark as its name, showing how women and young girls in several parts of the globe are dragged into sex slavery, many ending up in the United States. But the trade is not confined to foreigners; one of the victims is an American girl kidnapped off the streets of Manila during a family trip. 
 The series was developed in consultation with nonprofit agencies and the Department of Homeland Security. The State Department estimates that traffickers bring 800,000 people a year, most of them women and children, across international borders, forcing them to work as prostitutes or in sweatshops.
 Like Ms. Dominik, Mira Sorvino, who stars in the series as a rookie federal agent trying to crack a sex-trafficking ring, brings an extra layer of commitment to her task. Among her chief causes is Amnesty International's Stop Violence Against Women campaign, and she said she hoped the film would serve as an educational force, showing viewers ''what trafficking is and what it looks like from the outside.'' Not only is the problem largely hidden from view, she said, but it is shrouded in misperceptions: for instance, that the women trapped in this world have become sex workers voluntarily, and that they are all poor and foreign. In reality, she said, the sex-slave trade draws its victims from a variety of economic classes, and from within the United States as well as without.
 ''I would hope,'' she said, ''that people would be very, very careful with their daughters after seeing this.'' NEIL GENZLINGER

HEADLINE: The Budget Isn't Broken

BYLINE: By Seymour P. Lachman. 
Seymour P. Lachman, a professor at Adelphi University, was a Democratic state senator from Brooklyn and Staten Island from 1996 to 2004.

 BODY:
THIS Nov. 8, politicians in Albany are hoping to persuade New Yorkers that they are finally serious about fixing a dysfunctional Legislature that frequently misses budget deadlines. To this end, they have placed an initiative, known as Proposal 1, on the state ballot. This amendment would give greater budgetary authority to the Legislature, fundamentally altering the current budget process. It is one of the most sweeping and significant constitutional changes to be proposed in New York since the constitutional convention of 1967. 
 It's also a very bad idea. It would destroy one of the few parts of the budget process that is not, in fact, broken. To understand why voters should reject Proposal 1, look at the constitutional rules that now underlie budget making. 
In keeping with a basic principle of American government, the power to tax and spend rests with the State Legislature. But when it comes to budgetary details, the legislative branch in New York takes a back seat to the governor in some crucial respects. The Senate and Assembly are not allowed to produce their own spending plan from scratch. Instead, they have to work from a template of appropriations supplied by the governor, in his annual executive budget. New York is one of 43 states that permits the governor to have a line-item veto; the Legislature, however, has the power to override with a two-thirds vote of both houses. 
 Why does the law give the governor the power to drive the budget-making process? One of the best explanations was supplied by Henry Stimson, a United States attorney for the Southern District of New York in the early 20th century who later served under five presidents. ''We cannot expect economy'' in the budget, he said, ''unless some one man will have to lie awake nights to accomplish it.''
 Of course, strong central authority is no guarantee of good budgetary results. Our dangerously growing state debt burden alone is proof of that. But at least it's clear who bears the ultimate responsibility for whatever goes right or wrong with the budget, and that's the governor. 
 For decades, legislative leaders have fought bitterly over budget issues with governors from both parties, from Franklin D. Roosevelt through George E. Pataki. The current leaders -- Joseph Bruno, the Senate majority leader, and Sheldon Silver, the Assembly speaker -- are no exceptions. These disputes culminated last year in a landmark Court of Appeals decision that strongly affirmed the governor's power and limited the Legislature's ability to alter his appropriations bills.
 Legislative leaders were understandably unhappy with this result. But even before the final decision was handed down, they had put together an amendment, embarking on a constitutional quick fix that will actually make the situation worse. 
 If Proposal 1 is approved, it will pave the way for the automatic expiration of the executive budget proposal at the end of each fiscal year. If the Senate and Assembly have not acted on the governor's proposals by then, legislators will be free to use the prior year's budget as a foundation for a spending plan of their own design. So if they don't like the governor's recommendations for the budget, it's in their interest to delay the process. 
 But the real problem is not that the law gives the governor so much authority, it's that Mr. Bruno and Mr. Silver have developed the political weight to wield so much power. It's their objectives and desire for pork that stall the budget year after year. And if the proposal passes, they'll have only more power. To deal with the myriad complex issues associated with writing a $106 billion state budget, legislators will be heavily dependent on the legislatures' fiscal staffs -- whose members are mostly appointed by the Senate majority leader and the Assembly speaker. 
 For all the criticism our Legislature engenders, this is not a matter of personalities but of principle. The democratic process in New York will be weakened if we shift the ultimate budgetary responsibility from an executive who answers to 19 million people, to 212 legislators who ultimately take their marching orders from two individuals -- the Senate leader, who represents just 310,000 people, and the Assembly speaker, who represents 125,000. 
 New York's legislative process is, in many respects, in need of fundamental change. But the solution is not to rewrite one of the few provisions of our state Constitution that has stood the test of time.

HEADLINE: As Their Walls Fill Up, Galleries March Farther West

BYLINE: By STEVEN KURUTZ

 BODY:
Ten years ago, a handful of art galleries that had been priced out of SoHo moved north to Chelsea, remaking former garage and warehouse spaces in the West 20's between 10th and 11th Avenues. Today, a head-spinning 300 galleries are crowded into the neighborhood. And the city's immutable laws of real estate being what they are, it seemed only a matter of time before rising rents precipitated another migration. 
 That time has arrived. In January, an art consultant and six galleries, including Clementine Gallery and John Connelly Presents, will take up residence in the Terminal Warehouse building on West 27th Street between 11th and 12th Avenues. The location is only a block or so from the heart of the gallery district, but the move is indicative of a pioneering spirit: only one major gallery, Roebling Hall, has ventured across 11th Avenue. Now, however, with many long-term leases set to expire soon, other galleries are likely to follow. 
The moves underscore the changing economics of the neighborhood, which has become more competitive not only for new galleries seeking to open but also for established ones seeking to expand. Derek Eller, the owner of the Derek Eller Gallery, has wanted to move from his second-floor location on West 25th Street into a larger, ground-floor space. In the art world, a ground-floor location is seen as more prestigious and as an eventual necessity; as Mr. Eller puts it, ''People are basically lazy, and they don't want to walk up stairs.'' 
 Recently, he was shown what he described as a ''vanilla box'' on 24th Street, which was renting for $50 a square foot, well out of his price range. So he is moving to a ground-floor space in the Terminal Warehouse building, doubling his square footage and replacing the three-foot-wide door of his current gallery with an entrance double that size, one that will allow his artists to install more ambitious works because they can bring them through the door. 
 Given that climbing a flight a set of stairs is too much for some gallerygoers, how will they feel about hiking an entire block? Mr. Eller said that if he were making the move alone he would have reservations, but he sees safety in numbers.
 ''We're all different,'' Mr. Eller said of his fellow tenants, ''but we complement each other.'' 
 The Terminal Warehouse building, an old shipping facility, is a monumental structure that takes up an entire city block. It has its charms; the street in front is cobblestone, and there is a view of the water. But it feels a world removed from the frantic art and commerce on West 25th and 26th Streets. The truth is, it recalls the way the neighborhood looked a decade ago, before all the galleries moved up from SoHo. STEVEN KURUTZ

HEADLINE: The Closing Of a Hospital

 BODY:

To the Editor:
 Closing a community hospital, particularly one with the long service and history of St. Mary's in Crown Heights, Brooklyn (''Lights Out,'' Oct. 16), is never an easy decision. But the current economics of health care delivery forces such cost-saving decisions not only in New York but also in many communities across the country, often as a result of the increase in patients choosing the hospital they perceive will provide better care even if less convenient. 
This situation may not be as dire as your article seems to indicate. I'd venture that patients would welcome transport by van service to a superior nearby hospital. This would cost significantly less than St. Mary's $10 million annual losses. Combine this with the enhanced income and efficiency in increased patient volumes of the receiving hospital and we have a winning program.
 When a valuable community service is forced to close, there is a collective societal and financial responsibility to structure a replacement service as an alternative for the public good.

HEADLINE: For Some College Graduates, a Fanciful Detour (or Two) Before Their Careers Begin

BYLINE: By ALAN FINDER

 BODY:
Laurie Heckman worked as a whitewater rafting guide in Colorado. Steve Wiener has been crisscrossing the country in a large van, taking international tourists to see major cities and national parks.
 Zach Carson bought a small bus, converted the engine to run on recycled vegetable oil and is touring the country promoting alternative fuels.
 All are recent college graduates who intend to go on to graduate school, but not yet. Like a growing number of graduates, they are taking time away from school and the vigorous pursuit of a career. Some are looking for new experiences; others want to test potential careers or devote themselves to public service for a while; still others simply want to have a good time after the rigors of high school and college. 
 Career development professionals call the break the timeout or gap years, and the directors of career offices at a dozen major colleges and universities said more students are taking it than ever before. In response, the career offices have begun changing how they function.
 ''At some point, I'd like to do graduate school,'' said Mr. Carson, who graduated in May from the University of Vermont with a major in environmental studies and since then has driven 10,000 miles through 25 states in his converted bus, preaching the virtues of its vegetable-oil engine.
 ''But I've just finished 16 grades of school and I haven't lived yet,'' he said. ''I think the important thing is to always be learning. And when I get to the point that I need credentials, I'll go back to school.''
 Career counselors at the University of Vermont first noticed about two years ago a significant increase in the number of seniors eager to take a break after graduation, saying they were not ready to commit to graduate school or a career.
 ''Students are saying, 'You know what, I've been working hard and I've been doing what people have told me to do for a long time,''' said Pamela K. Gardner, director of career services at Vermont. '''What if I just play for a time?' They want to find an adventure and have a good time, but they are also thoughtfully trying to find their place in the world.''
 ''We've always seen students do this,'' Ms. Gardner said, ''but it's become a more common occurrence, and it's more socially acceptable now.''
 At Lafayette College, in Easton, Pa., many more seniors have applied for community service programs like the Peace Corps and Teach for America in the last two years. At Washington University in St. Louis; Harvard; the University of California, Los Angeles; Dartmouth; and the University of Colorado, counselors said that over the last five years or more, they have seen a larger proportion of seniors looking to take time off from the serious pursuit of their future. Most of these students work after graduation, but not at jobs that they see as part of their long-term careers.
 ''I tell students there is no rush here,'' said Linda N. Arra, the director of career services at Lafayette. ''Career interests typically don't solidify until about the age of 25. All the research shows that. And yet we are asking students to think about careers pretty early in life.'' 
 Students who take a timeout are still a minority of all graduates, career counselors said, and not every counselor said the number was expanding. At Ohio State, the proportion of graduates who opt for nontraditional alternatives is small and has remained fairly steady, said Martha M. Garland, the dean of undergraduate studies. 
 If students choose to do something different after college, graduate and professional schools usually do not hold it against them. ''Most graduate and professional schools today would prefer that a student take the time to go away, have different experiences and then come back refocused,'' said Bill Wright-Swadel, director of career services at Harvard College. 
 There are three primary reasons students seek out alternatives to traditional career-building after college, said Mark Smith, assistant vice chancellor and director of the career center at Washington University. One is simply fatigue.
 ''I see our students immensely involved as undergraduates,'' Mr. Smith said. ''They are taking overloads of classes, double majors, and then they are very involved in extracurricular life. A lot of them are coming out and they are just kind of worn out.''
 Other students, he said, are motivated by idealism to seek out community service programs. Kathy L. Sims, director of U.C.L.A's career center, said that every year about 60 new graduates of the university go to Japan to teach English for a year.
 The third motivation is to test a possible career by working in a field for few years before committing to graduate or professional school. Someone contemplating law school might work for a while in a legal office or in government. 
 ''These are not necessarily unfocused people who are putting off launching,'' Mr. Wright-Swadel of Harvard said. ''Often they have a plan and they have three or four things in mind that they want to experiment with.''
 Cultural patterns have changed, too, with fewer people getting married immediately after college and fewer taking jobs with companies at which they expect to work for their entire careers, said Lisa Severy, director of career services at the University of Colorado.
 The mind-set for many students is ''you get your degree and then you think about what you might want to do,'' she said. 
 Experience Inc., a Boston-based company that provides information about jobs and employers to students at 3,800 universities through an Internet service, recently prepared a questionnaire for subscribers on their choices after graduation. More than 2,000 seniors and recent graduates filled out the questionnaire online over four days in mid-September, and the results appeared to bolster what career counselors have been observing.
 Most of those who responded said they were considering taking a year off after graduating or were actually doing so. Only a small portion said they wanted to do community service, with most saying that they either wanted time to decide on a career or wanted to pursue new experiences to build their resumes.
 These shifts in attitudes have prompted many college career centers to reconsider how they interact with students. At Vermont, the career services office is trying to change its image. ''We're not going to be the place where you come in with a tie and talk to some corporation,'' said Ms. Gardner, the director.
 The office organized a new event for seniors last year in the student center, where tables offering spin art and massages were interspersed with those that had advice on how to write a resume. Vermont has also added a counselor who specializes in nonprofit organizations. 
 Many university career officials also said they are working much more often with alumni. Some institutions provide free guidance to alumni, while others charge a fee. 
 Ms. Heckman, who worked as a whitewater rafting guide after graduating from Vermont last spring, said she expects to seek help eventually from the university's career office. But first she plans to spend a year or more in Colorado.
 After rafting season ended in August, she moved to Durango, where she works as a hostess and buses tables at a brewery and volunteers at a nature center. Having majored in environmental studies and economics, she hopes to find a job ''that's more environmentally oriented,'' so she can gain experience before applying to graduate school.
 ''I think of this year as just kind of gaining experience,'' Ms. Heckman, 22, said. ''Obviously, I don't wantto bus tables forever. It's kind of nice having a year off, having fun. I hope to do a lot of skiing this winter.''
 Mr. Wiener, who has been leading tour groups through the United States and Canada since June, has had a variety of experiences since graduating from U.C.L.A. in 2002 with a major in political science. He worked for a few months in Dublin and then spent two years as a corporate recruiter in Oakland and San Francisco, where he learned, he said, that the business world was not for him.
 He took the touring job to see the country and to have an adventure. Mr. Wiener, who is 25, recently completed a three-week tour of the Southwest. It will probably be his last.
 ''I decided I did this, I had my fun,'' he said. ''It's time for public policy graduate school.''

HEADLINE: Thousands of Demolitions Near, New Orleans Braces for New Pain

BYLINE: By ADAM NOSSITER

DATELINE: NEW ORLEANS, Oct. 22 

 BODY:
As crews begin inspecting thousands of rotting houses and preservationists begin efforts to save them, city and federal officials say that 30,000 to 50,000 of the city's houses will probably have to be demolished.
 That number, though smaller than some earlier predictions, nonetheless represents more than a quarter of the city's housing stock. A few weeks from now, when giant track excavators begin tearing into homes that once sheltered families and nest eggs, the city will experience one of the most painful moments of its ordeal.
''Really, the whole scope of this thing is hard to get your mind around,'' said Allen Morse, who will be in charge of the demolition effort for the Army Corps of Engineers. ''It's going to be a huge task.'' 
 Already the dreaded bright red-orange stickers blaring ''unsafe'' have begun to proliferate on houses, signaling what is becoming a passionate debate over the extent of the demolition. 
 Of the city's 180,000 houses, 110,000 were flooded, city officials say, and half of those sat for days or weeks in more than six feet of water. If up to 50,000 homes are beyond salvaging, many of the others could be saved with expensive repair jobs, but large numbers of homeowners may not have the resources to rebuild. As a result, the number of demolitions could soar beyond 50,000. 
 The Corps of Engineers is being careful not to make predictions about the scope of the job. ''The word 'demolition' is not even being discussed around here,'' said Kelley Aasen, the corps official in charge of the mammoth task of inspecting every house in New Orleans for obvious structural damage. ''It's triage, right now.''
 Yet as building inspectors fan out around the city, taking the first steps in deciding the fate of flooded homes, a picture is beginning to emerge on the Corps of Engineers map: red dots are sprouting in the Lower Ninth Ward, and the area below Lake Pontchartrain is a field of yellow, meaning structural damage is suspected. Houses marked with either color face a tenuous future.
 By midweek, about 30,000 inspections had been completed, with 7,000 houses tagged yellow and 700 red, corps officials said. Most of the hardest-hit areas have not yet been inspected. 
 The process has not been without hiccups. The Shaw Group, the construction company that is providing many of the inspectors to the corps, provoked complaints this week from the corps and city building officials that some people hired as inspectors, including a retired art dealer and a hairdresser, were unqualified to make structural appraisals.
 By Friday, a corps official said Shaw had responded to the complaints, dismissing two dozen of the least qualified inspectors. 
 City officials say it will probably not be necessary to destroy entire neighborhoods, speaking instead of city blocks. There had been earlier discussion of ending the city's preservation-review process and allowing bulldozers to plow through some of the most historically significant neighborhoods in New Orleans. That idea aroused consternation. But those fears ended when city officials promised that historic houses would get special consideration and that deluged neighborhoods like the Lower Ninth Ward and New Orleans East would not be wiped out.
 ''There's a recognition that the New Orleans housing stock is really pretty sturdy, and there should not be the necessity for wholesale demolition once thought,'' said Camille Strachan, a trustee emeritus of the National Trust for Historic Preservation and a New Orleans lawyer. ''I think that as the hysteria subsides along with the water, there will be a lot more rational decisions made.''
 But questions remain about a process that is certain to change the face of this city for good. No one is certain when the demolitions will begin in earnest, what will happen to houses without flood insurance or whether New Orleans homeowners, facing the demolition squad, will resist en masse.
 Already, flashpoints have emerged in the complex interplay of municipal vision, homeowner rights and federal mandates. Some of these conflicts hark back to age-old fights here between developers and preservationists; some are brand-new, reflecting the changed, browned-over landscape in large parts of this city. 
 City officials say that even when neighborhoods like the Ninth Ward are rebuilt, they will look very different, particularly given the staggering cost of trying to return them to something resembling their earlier state.
 ''People are going to be upside down when they look at the cost of rebuilding,'' said Greg Meffert, chief information officer for the City of New Orleans and a top aide to Mayor C. Ray Nagin.
 But preservationists say that money must be found to rebuild some of the most historic residential structures and that the demolition process must proceed cautiously. 
 ''When you have a city that has suffered an incredible disaster, you can't overlook any economic resource, and the historic buildings are an economic resource,'' said Patricia Gay, executive director of the Preservation Resource Center of New Orleans, the leading local preservation group. ''This type of thing is the flesh and blood of the city.''
 Officials at every level take pains to emphasize that the demolition will be kept to a minimum. ''The current thinking is, you only go tear down the absolute minimum number of homes,'' said Mr. Morse, the corps official who will take charge of what he calls a ''sensitive'' operation. ''We're trying to save as many homes as possible.'' And the officials emphasize that owners' rights will be paramount. 
 With the demolition some time away -- ''Nobody wants to really put a marker on the wall as to when this happens,'' Mr. Morse said -- neither officials nor homeowners in New Orleans seem ready to envision the day of reckoning. 
 ''As far as I'm concerned, I'm just going to stand still. I'm not tearing anything down right now,'' said Janie Blackmon, a loan officer who ''saved one picture of my beautiful daughter,'' but nothing else, from her home in New Orleans East.
 For now, there is brave talk of hanging on to ravaged neighborhoods. ''I don't care if I have to go door to door,'' said Annie Avery, director of African-American heritage preservation for the Preservation Resource Center. ''I want to save our neighborhoods.''
 In practice, it will be very difficult for many homeowners to save their flooded houses. For a start, about half of them did not have flood insurance, meaning they might have to foot the entire cost of restoration themselves -- a crushing burden in a city where nearly a quarter of the residents were below the poverty level. 
 Federal flood insurance guidelines will also require that thousands of damaged homes in floodplains be elevated by a foot or more, a fearsomely expensive proposition for which there is limited federal assistance. If the city allows those homes to be rebuilt without being elevated, it could be cut off from the National Flood Insurance Program.
 Finally, with homeowners all over the city desperately scrambling for contractors, the price of renovations has quadrupled to nearly $120 a square foot. On top of an existing mortgage, the economics of reconstruction quickly become prohibitive, even for yellow-tagged houses. 
 ''New construction is a lot cheaper than renovation,'' said Jay Williams, a local insurance agent. 
 Homeowners will be given the final say on whether their houses will be torn down, but they will have a limited time to decide whether to renovate or demolish. After that, the city can order an unsafe house to come down. 
 ''At some point, we have to have a cutoff,'' said Michael Centineo, director of the Department of Safety and Permits in New Orleans. ''When it becomes a public nuisance, when it becomes a blight.''
 For now, the piles of debris outside many homes here, put there by owners who are gutting them, testify to the hope that houses and neighborhoods can be saved. Yet uncertainty about the future prevails. 
 ''We're not really getting feedback as to how much of the neighborhood is going to be rebuilt,'' said Bari Landry, past president of the Lakeview Civic Improvement Association in the middle-class northwest corner of the city. ''No one is really giving us the information we need.''

HEADLINE: Figures Reveal Dynamics of Disaster Giving

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE STROM

 BODY:
Donations for the victims of the earthquake that ripped through Pakistan and India have not come close to the level of giving that followed the tsunami that wreaked havoc around the rim of the Indian Ocean and Hurricane Katrina, which destroyed a huge swath of the Gulf Coast. But relief organizations and fund-raising experts say the generosity directed toward the victims of those disasters was aberrational and should not be used as a yardstick to measure giving for other emergencies.
 ''Giving for the tsunami was literally off the charts,'' said Patrick Rooney, director of research at the Center on Philanthropy at Indiana University, which tracks giving. ''There may be an issue of donor fatigue, it's too early to tell, but it looks like giving for the Pakistan earthquake is more typical of the historical response by U.S. donors to international emergencies.'' 
Before the tsunami, the biggest amount collected by the American Red Cross for an international disaster was $50 million. The Red Cross collected $556 million for tsunami relief. Overall, $1.3 billion was collected for the tsunami relief and $1.8 billion has been collected for victims of Hurricane Katrina. 
 Save the Children has collected $1.5 million in donations and pledges for earthquake relief, or almost five times what it received after the 2003 earthquake in Bam, Iran, which killed more than 26,000 people. 
 ''If you look at the amount of money we have received in response to the current emergency in Pakistan, it is not out of line with what we have received for other major emergencies over the past several years,'' said Rudy von Bernuth, vice president for humanitarian programs at Save the Children USA.
 Of greater consternation to relief officials is the tepid response of government donors to the crisis. The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, known as OCHA, has received gifts and pledges totaling $91 million for earthquake relief, or 29 percent of the $312 million it has requested. 
 By the 10th day after the tsunami, the agency had received commitments for 80 percent of its request for money. Government donors also have given $135 million and pledged $313 million to private relief organizations and government agencies in Pakistan for earthquake relief.
 The United States has contributed $8.8 million toward OCHA's earthquake appeal, compared with $48 million it gave toward the $1.29 billion the agency sought after the tsunami. It gave many millions more in assistance outside the appeal.
 Executives from aid organizations said Andrew S. Natsios, administrator of the United States Agency for International Development, had recently asked them to redirect money they received for the tsunami victims to earthquake relief efforts, which they cannot do because of donor-imposed restrictions.
 ''We were shocked,'' the head of one organization said, speaking on the condition of anonymity for fear of reprisal from USAID. ''It suggested to me that the U.S. is really struggling to meet all the obligations it currently has.''
 Relief executives distinguish between the tsunami and Hurricane Katrina because donation patterns after a domestic disaster are notably different from those that appear around an international emergency.
 The executives also draw sharp distinctions between the tsunami and other international disasters. The tsunami occurred one day after Christmas, a time when donors feel generous and just ahead of the end of the tax year. There was also little other news to compete for attention.
 ''When the media is out there running 800 numbers across the bottom of the screen, more money gets raised,'' said Stephanie Kurzina, vice president for resource development at Oxfam America. ''We haven't had that with the earthquake the way we did with the tsunami. We don't have George Bush and Bill Clinton out there encouraging people to give for this disaster.''
 Jeremy Barnicle, a spokesman for Mercy Corps, said corporate and foundation donors had been particularly generous, with corporate and foundation donors giving more than half of the $2.5 million the organization has collected so far. 
 Mercy Corps has been able to reach out to some of the 90,000 new donors it has attracted. ''The robust response we're seeing is largely a function for us of the growth in our donor base as a result of the tsunami and Katrina,'' Mr. Barnicle said. 
 The International Rescue Committee, which had some 200 staff members in Pakistan and was one of the first organizations to make it into the affected area, has raised $653,000, which George Rupp, the group's chief executive, said was consistent with what it had raised for crises in Congo, Liberia and Sudan.
 Mr. Rupp said he expected fund-raising to hold up. ''I think because there are real Indian and Pakistani constituencies in the United States, we'll wind up with money for earthquake relief that may be somewhat above the norm for these kinds of forgotten disasters,'' he said. ''I think donors still have some spare change in their pockets.''

HEADLINE: When Even Health Insurance Is No Safeguard

BYLINE: By JOHN LELAND

DATELINE: CAMBY, Ind. 

 BODY:
Until the fourth trip to the hospital in 1998, Zachery Dorsett's parents thought their son was an average child who was having trouble getting over a passing illness. He was 7 months old, and it was his second case of pneumonia. 
 The Dorsetts, Sharon and Arnold, were concerned about Zachery's health, but they were not worried about the financial consequences. They were a young, middle-income couple, with health insurance that covered 90 percent of doctors' bills and most of the costs of prescription drugs.
Then the bills started coming in. After a week in the hospital, the couple's share came to $1,100 -- not catastrophic, but more than their small savings. They enrolled in a 90-day payment plan with the hospital and struggled to make the monthly installments of nearly $400, hoping that they did not hit any other expenses. 
 But Zachery, who was eventually found to have an immune system disorder, kept getting sick, and the expense of his treatment -- fees for tests, hospitalizations, medicine -- kept mounting, eventually costing the family $12,000 to $20,000 a year. Earlier this year, the Dorsetts stopped making mortgage payments on their ranch house, in a subdivision outside Indianapolis, because they could not afford them. In March, they filed for bankruptcy.
 ''Zach was really mad at us when we told him we were going to lose the house,'' Mrs. Dorsett said. ''We told him we had to make a choice: whether to pay for medical bills or the house.''
 She added: ''I didn't want the kids to hate their father for working all the time, but I also didn't want them to think we were irresponsible. I was worried about Zach feeling guilty or his sister blaming him that she has to leave her friends. But whatever we gave up is a small price to pay for his health.'' 
 Never have patients had so many medical options to extend, enrich or alter their lives. But these new options are expensive, and with them has come a change for which many Americans -- even those with health insurance -- are financially ill prepared. 
 After decades in which private and government insurance covered a progressively larger share of medical expenses, insurance companies are now shifting more costs to consumers, in the form of much higher deductibles, co-payments or premiums. At the same time, Americans are saving less and carrying higher levels of household debt, and even insured families are exposed to medical expenses that did not exist a decade ago. Many, like the Dorsetts, do not realize how vulnerable they are until the bills arrive.
 Lawyers and accountants say that for the more than 1.5 million American families who filed for bankruptcy protection last year, the most common causes were job loss and medical expenses. New bankruptcy legislation, which went into effect Oct. 17, requires middle-income debtors to repay a greater share of their debt. 

The Fight for Solvency
 The Dorsetts' filing came after years of accumulating relatively modest bills, often just co-payments on doctor visits or prescriptions. Almost since Zachery's birth, they had finished each year with more credit card debt than they had the year before. Even when they took out a second mortgage to pay off their credit cards, by the end of the year they were in debt again, with higher mortgage payments. And each year, their projected expenses were greater. 
 On a late summer morning, Mrs. Dorsett, now 32, sat with her son in Room 4013 at St. Vincent Children's Hospital in Indianapolis as a colorless infusion of immune globulin, a treatment made from blood plasma, dripped slowly into his left arm, supplying the antibodies that his immune system does not produce. 
 The monthly infusion, which has become a regular part of his childhood along with soccer practice and family camping trips, costs $54,000 a year, of which the Dorsetts will pay more than $5,000.
 ''My friends don't understand it,'' Mrs. Dorsett said, looking back at the family's relentless, inevitable process of insolvency. ''They think, How could it get so bad so quick? Unless you have a sick kid, you don't know what it's like.'' 
 For the Dorsetts, this is what the end looked like, according to the family's bankruptcy filing: They had $1,431 in their checking and savings accounts; they owed $29,146 on various credit cards; and after refinancing their house to pay down their credit cards, they could no longer afford the payments on their house or car. 
 Mr. Dorsett, who works on commercial heating and air conditioning systems, sometimes stitching together 90-hour weeks, earns $68,000 a year. It is more money than his father ever made, but not enough to cover the bills, especially with the monthly infusions starting.
 Mrs. Dorsett recounts the impact their medical expenses have had on the family: They buy their clothing at yard sales, and skip vacations and restaurant meals. Mr. and Mrs. Dorsett argue, like many couples, mainly about money. Mr. Dorsett has had to work nights and weekends, with little contact with his wife and children; Mrs. Dorsett has tried to create a home for the children. 
 ''We don't live a frivolous life, but I need to make my kids' life normal,'' she said. ''They still need bikes. My husband says, 'Kids in the third world don't have those things.' I say, 'We don't live in a third world country.'''
 As the bills mounted, it was Mrs. Dorsett who forced her husband to acknowledge that he could not simply work more hours. ''I showed him, even if I went back to work, we'd still be in debt in 10 years,'' Mrs. Dorsett said. ''Our kids could not go to college.''
 In a study of 1,771 people who filed for bankruptcy, reported this year by four researchers at Harvard and Ohio University, 28 percent said the cause was illness or injury. Most were middle class, educated and had health insurance at the start of the treatment. Many lost phone service, went without meals or skipped medications to save money. Although the study relied largely on people's own accounts of their finances, the figure suggests that as many as 400,000 American families file for bankruptcy each year because of medical expenses.
 ''Not only are the bills higher, but the way we pay for care has changed,'' said Elizabeth Warren, a professor at Harvard Law School and one of the study's authors. ''My mother always carried a bill with the doctor, but every dollar she paid went to principal.
 ''Today, the doctor takes a credit card, and a family might be paying that off at extraordinary interest rates. So people may recover physically from major medical injury, but may not recover financially.'' 

A Shift in Burden
 Though health care costs have been rising for decades, changes in insurance starting around 2001 have put more pressure on consumers, especially those who need the most treatment, said Paul Ginsburg, president of the Center for Studying Health System Change, a nonpartisan research group financed primarily by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.
 The families driven into bankruptcy by these costs include those dealing with both rare and common medical conditions, and others who simply saved too little or owed too much in the false confidence that there would not be unforeseen medical problems, or that their insurance would protect them. 
 In Pfafftown, N.C., Glenda and Robert Lee Gantt filed for bankruptcy protection after Mrs. Gantt's rheumatoid arthritis forced her to give up working as a security guard. In Houston, Roy and Patsy McKanna filed for bankruptcy after helping their adult daughter pay for breast cancer treatment.
 ''We were just trying to keep them from sinking until things got better,'' said Mrs. McKanna, 71. ''They took bankruptcy a little more than a year before we did. We managed our budget for 52 years. You never know what life's going to throw at you.''
 In the 1990's, as medical expenses rose faster than inflation, insurance companies limited costs of coverage by limiting patients' treatment options through the system known as managed care. Even as hospitals and drug companies introduced expensive new treatments, out-of-pocket costs for patients actually fell during the decade. 
 But as consumers have objected to the limits imposed by managed care, insisting on more choice, the trade-off has been higher insurance premiums and higher out-of-pocket costs, said Arnold Milstein, medical director of the Pacific Business Group on Health. 
 Dr. Milstein said companies had two rationales for shifting expenses to consumers: to ''share the pain'' that came with higher overall costs and to encourage patients to seek care judiciously. 
 ''But what if you're unlucky enough to get sick?'' he said. ''Now you pay a lot more out of pocket. One of the unintended consequences of cost-shifting is that sicker people -- the ones who most need insurance -- are the ones who end up paying more of their bills.'' 
 From 2000 to 2005, employees in the most common type of insurance plan, known as preferred provider organizations, saw their premiums for individual coverage rise 76 percent, to $603 from $342, while their deductibles -- the amount they pay out of pocket before insurance kicks in -- rose almost 85 percent, to $323 from $175, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. By 2003, a survey by the Center for Studying Health System Change estimated, 20 million American families had trouble paying their medical bills. Two-thirds of these had health insurance.

Twists of Fate
 Mr. and Mrs. Dorsett never expected to be part of this group. They met more than a decade ago at a gas station where she worked part time while studying to be a nurse. 
 Mr. Dorsett liked to talk on his way home from work. Both wanted to have a big family. They married with plans to have six children. Mrs. Dorsett hoped to finish her studies and work as a nurse; Mr. Dorsett thought she should stay at home with the children. 
 But shortly after Zachery was born, they knew something was not right. He got the same illnesses or infections as other children, but while others got better, he would get worse. A cold would turn into bronchitis; a sinus infection would require 45 days of antibiotics, and often turn into pneumonia. He needed follow-up doctor visits, refills on prescriptions, X-rays, CAT scans -- each time ringing up co-payments of $10, $15, $30 or more. 
 On a blazing summer evening, the Dorsetts sat at their kitchen table. Their one extravagance, a large-screen television, occupied the children: Zachery, 8; Dakota, 5; and Jessica, 4. Mrs. Dorsett bought the television with her mother as a present for her husband, from money she had earned baby-sitting. Mr. Dorsett, she recalled, had complained about the expense. 
 At 40, Mr. Dorsett has a ruddy complexion, buzzed blond hair and a light beard. As he nursed a can of supermarket-brand cream soda, he seemed to wish he could turn back the calendar, find some alternative to bankruptcy court. It is a source of recurring friction between them: Mr. Dorsett never wanted to file; Mrs. Dorsett convinced him that there was no alternative. 
 ''I make good money, and I work hard for it,'' Mr. Dorsett said. ''When we filed for bankruptcy, I felt I failed.'' 
 He said one of his hardest moments was telling his father about the bankruptcy. His father had worked two or three jobs during hard times, but always managed to pay his debts. Arnold Dorsett made more money than his father ever had, he said, but what good did it do him? 
 ''At work,'' he said, ''the single guys say our insurance is good. Well, it's good for them, because they don't have kids, or don't get sick. When you have a kid who's chronically sick, it's totally different.'' 
 On his long days, Mr. Dorsett usually skips lunch rather than spend $6 or $7 at a fast food restaurant. He wishes he could take the family to the Grand Canyon, or afford a house where the girls could have their own bedrooms. But when asked about his sacrifices, he said the luxury he missed most was time, not money. ''Zach and I had no relationship until two years ago,'' he said. ''Dakota hardly ever talked to me. I was putting in 80, 90 hours a week, not having a relationship with my children.'' 
 While Mr. Dorsett works, Mrs. Dorsett juggles child care with the seemingly endless wrangling with insurance companies and, until the bankruptcy filing, with creditors. 

Managing a Medical Mystery
 On an August morning at home, Mrs. Dorsett prepared a lunch of corn dogs and macaroni and cheese while Zachery got ready for soccer camp. By all appearances, he is a healthy-looking boy with a somber disposition. Though he has missed as many as 42 days in a school year because of illness, he has friends and keeps up with his classes, his mother said. His worst problem at school, she said, is pushing himself too hard. 
 Until earlier this year, no one knew what was wrong with him. His immune disorder, known as common variable immune deficiency, can be detected through a simple blood test, but as Mrs. Dorsett took him from doctor to doctor, usually with small problems that would not go away, the doctors looked elsewhere. Some treated only the immediate symptoms; others made Mrs. Dorsett feel she was overtreating her child. 
 ''I felt there was something wrong,'' she said. ''But you can't walk into a doctor's office and say you think you know what it is because you saw it online. They're the ones with the prescription pads, and I didn't want to make them mad.''
 As the family went from one doctor to the next, without a diagnosis of the root problem, the insurance company often questioned the expenses. Why did Zachery need four doctor visits or five rounds of antibiotics for an ailment that most children shook off in a couple of days? Mrs. Dorsett spent days on the phone, often in voice-mail loops, and often long-distance, pleading her case. 
 ''Like when they refused to pay for antibiotics when he had pneumonia'' last year, she said. ''The antibiotics cost $373, and we didn't have it. But we couldn't just not give it to him. I knew the review board would come around eventually, but he needed the medicine right away. Finally the doctor gave us samples.'' 
 She managed the expenses, like many people, by constantly applying for new credit cards, rolling the debt from the old cards into the new ones, which usually came with low introductory interest rates. In a good year, they would have the rolling charges on their credit cards down to $5,000 or $6,000, but the charges always went up again. 
 Gradually the debts started to catch up with her. When she fell behind on one of her heavily used cards, the company raised the 2.9 percent interest rate to 14 percent. Suddenly, she could not find a card with a low interest rate or a line of credit of more than $5,000, when the family balance exceeded $13,000. She tried playing dumb with the company, saying she was sure she had sent the check. ''But they weren't buying it,'' she said. 
 With Mr. Dorsett's insurance, Zachery's bills were not astronomical, but they were just beyond what the Dorsetts could afford. Finally, Mrs. Dorsett asked one of the hospitals for assistance. ''They said all I could do was go to churches,'' she said. ''Which is worse, filing for bankruptcy or -- I'm going to say it -- begging at churches?''

Now, Uncertainty
 Since the couple filed for bankruptcy protection in March, the creditors have stopped calling for money. The Dorsetts filed for, and were granted, protection under Chapter 7, which means that a trustee will liquidate their nonexempt assets to pay their creditors. But as in most Chapter 7 cases, there are no assets to liquidate. 
 In the meantime, since they are resigned to losing their house, they are putting aside the money that would have gone to the mortgage for the next round of big expenses. For the first time since Zachery's birth they are saving money. 
 Even now, credit card companies still offer them cards, which they have turned down. But because of the bankruptcy, they know they will not be able to secure a mortgage on their next home. Many of their friends, and especially the mothers in Mrs. Dorsett's preschool group, do not know about the bankruptcy. 
 Even with their debts cleared for the moment, there are no guarantees that the Dorsetts will be able to stay above water. The immune globulin may keep Zachery out of the emergency room this winter, but it may not. They have no credit to buffer unforeseen expenses -- a sudden car repair, a slowdown at work, braces. 
 Mrs. Dorsett tried to put the best spin on the contingencies that loom over their lives: ''If we get another house for under $800 a month, if nothing else happens, if the treatments work, we'll make it.'' 
 And if things do not work out, they will face that another day, and for many days after that.

HEADLINE: Commerce and Religion Collide on a Mountainside 

BYLINE: By RANDAL C. ARCHIBOLD

DATELINE: FLAGSTAFF, Ariz. 

 BODY:
In the view of American Indians here, the spirits that inhabit the San Francisco Peaks, towering 12,000-foot-plus mountains rising from the desert here, certainly did not appreciate it when a ski run was built a quarter of a century ago on one slope. 
 So imagine, tribal leaders ask, what the spirits will think -- or worse, do -- when treated wastewater is piped up from Flagstaff and sprayed on the mountain so the resort, the Arizona Snowbowl, can make more snow to ski on? A lawyer for one of the tribes likened it to ''pouring dirty water on the Vatican.''
In a trial that began this month, 13 Indian tribes who regard the peaks as virtual living deities of the highest order argued that the plan would interfere with their religious practices, including the gathering of mountain water and herbs they say the artificial snow would taint.
 ''The mountain is like a power plant,'' Frank Mapatis, a spiritual leader in the Hualapai tribe, said in court. ''You plant a feather there, and it is like plugging into a power plant.'' 
 The case pits economic interests against traditional practices, and culture versus science, the kind of clashes that are becoming increasingly common in the West as population booms and development pressures butt against Indian desires to reassert ancient practices.
 Operators of the Arizona Snowbowl, one of the few ski resorts in the state, said it could go out of business without making snow because winter precipitation is so erratic in the high desert here. The resort, which has proposed the snowmaking under a plan to expand the ski runs, and the Forest Service, which approved the plan, both say the water would be cleaned to the highest degree, A-plus in the industry vernacular, though falling short of potable.
 The federal government has said that even with the expanded ski runs, the resort would be using only about one percent of the peaks on the otherwise undeveloped mountain.
 Eric Borowsky, a principal of the resort, said in an interview that despite bountiful snows last season, most other recent years have been dry. In the winter of 2001-02, the resort was open only four days and revenue was only 1.5 percent of the budget.
 ''No business in the world can stay in business if you miss 98.5 percent of your revenue,'' Mr. Borowsky said. The 777-acre resort pays the federal government 1.5 percent of its annual revenue in rent, which in 2004 was $138,957.
 To stress their sensitivity to the tribes, the Snowbowl hired Bruce Babbitt, a former Arizona governor and interior secretary under President Bill Clinton, as a consultant. Mr. Babbitt, as secretary, was instrumental in closing down a pumice mine on the mountain that he called a ''sacrilegious scar.'' The pumice had been used to make stone-washed jeans, and in a gesture of thanks, the tribes gave Mr. Babbitt a pair.
 Demonstrators outside the courthouse in Prescott, incensed at what they perceive as Mr. Babbitt's turnabout, have taunted him with signs shaped like underpants (as in give back the jeans).
 Mr. Babbitt said he would not comment while the trial was under way. 
 Indian tribes unsuccessfully sued to block the resort in 1979. The current lawsuit, aided by environmental groups including the Sierra Club, was brought under more recent laws and regulations that require federal agencies to consult with American Indian groups when considering development on federal land and to take into account the effect on religious practices. The resort sits amid the vast Coconino National Forest and while not on tribal land, is within the ancestral boundaries claimed by several tribes. 
 ''I think that if the tribe can demonstrate that this site is central and essential to its religion, it has a good chance of success in this case,'' said Robert Anderson, a University of Washington law professor who specializes in Native American legal issues. The defendants, he said, must show there was a ''compelling government interest'' in the decision.
 The groups also charge that the defendants, the Snowbowl and the Forest Service, did not adequately study whether the effluent could harm people, especially children, who consume artificial snow -- on purpose or not.
 The Snowbowl and Forest Service said in court papers that they made a good-faith effort to consult with the tribes -- the Forest Service in an environmental report said it held 41 meetings, made 205 phone calls and exchanged 245 letters with members of the tribes -- and found nothing environmentally egregious about using the treated sewage, known as reclaimed water. The resort balked at using fresh water because it is so scarce in Arizona, Mr. Borowsky said.
 Nora B. Rasure, the supervisor of the Coconino National Forest, wrote this year in the report that the resort ''has and continues to provide a valuable recreational experience to many people, and that in order to continue providing that experience in today's physical and business environment, changes are needed.'' 
 Ms. Rasure noted that none of the tribes performed ceremonies or maintained shrines within the resort property and that the improvements would involve only 205 acres.
 Ms. Rasure, through a spokeswoman, declined an interview.
 The trial, before Judge Paul G. Rosenblatt and expected to last into next month, has posed challenges for plaintiffs and defendants alike, as some Indians are reluctant to divulge closely guarded religious practices.
 Mr. Mapatis, the Hualapai spiritual leader, to the surprise of some other Indian leaders, told the court that he gathered plants and flowers for use in healing ceremonies and that after a woman gave birth he brought the placenta to the mountain to ensure the newborn has a healthy life. Members of his tribe use water from the mountain in sweat lodge ceremonies, and the peaks figure prominently in the Hualapai creation story, as well as other tribes'.
 Mixing mountain water with water that in an earlier, untreated form may have included waste from mortuaries or hospitals, Mr. Mapatis said, could infect members of his tribe with ''ghost sickness,'' a disagreeable state difficult to cure. 
 ''It's like putting death on the mountain, which would be a form of witchcraft or black magic,'' Mr. Mapatis said. ''I won't be able to practice my religion.''
 But Bill Bucky Preston, a spiritual leader in the Hopi tribe, which has a reputation for secrecy about their practices, refused to describe in detail what practices he would no longer be able to do or how the mountain figures in Hopi lore. And that was when his own lawyer was questioning him.
 ''It is very difficult to be put in this position to reveal this information,'' Mr. Preston said. ''We are told by our uncles and grandparents that it is sacred and cannot be revealed to anybody.''
 On a visit to the mountain earlier this month, Jeneda Benally, a Navajo advocate, said the very notion of making snow, regardless of the purity of the water, could offend the kachinas, the spirits on the mountain.
 ''The kachinas are the snow makers,'' she said. ''When man makes snow what does that tell the deities?''

HEADLINE: Pocketbook Politics 

BYLINE: By MANNY FERNANDEZ

 BODY:
In Washington Heights, people hustle to and from work, eager in the last weeks before the Nov. 8 mayoral election to talk not about politics, but about economics.
 Victor Garcia, watching his children play in a park, sat on a bench one recent afternoon and spoke of the rising cost of everything. He makes $18.70 an hour as a fire safety director, and he said his paycheck is never enough. ''If they don't want us to be in the city, then they should let us know,'' Mr. Garcia, 38, said of the working class. ''We'll leave and move to Pennsylvania.''
Many residents share Mr. Garcia's frustration. Washington Heights, a vibrant yet unpolished swath of Upper Manhattan, is a dollars-and-cents kind of place, home to auto mechanics, hospital workers and housekeepers who say they struggle to pay the rent, to pay for overnight parking, to pay to ride the No. 1 train, to pay a $15.93 bill for an appliance. People openly describe themselves as low-income. They say it with a kind of pride. 
 Amid this backdrop of financial worry, the race for mayor has played out in an unlikely fashion. Interviews with about two dozen people in Washington Heights in recent days suggest that party loyalty and ethnic politics have become secondary for the most part to pocketbook concerns about jobs and paying the rent. The daily drama between the two campaigns fades into the background, and the big question for many is not what the candidates stand for, but what they can do to ease the economic pressure.
 Some voters in this heavily Dominican area say they are drawn to Fernando Ferrer, the Democratic nominee who is trying to become the first Latino mayor, not because of his ethnicity, but because they believe he will be a champion for the poor and low-wage workers. 
 Others see his Republican opponent, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, as a successful business executive and a role model for immigrants and small business owners seeking better, wealthier lives. These voters do not necessarily blame the mayor for their economic hardships, but instead view him as part of the solution, as a generator of jobs and opportunities.
 The split among voters captures the eclectic nature of Washington Heights. This is a place -- a narrow stretch of streets high atop the island of Manhattan bordered by the Hudson and Harlem Rivers -- that remains a destination for thousands of immigrants from the Dominican Republic. Longtime residents say they see remnants of some of the problems that have plagued the neighborhood for decades, from poverty to drugs to crime. Yet they also say there are parts of the neighborhood that they hardly recognize, with new shops and banks opening and more affluent residents moving in.
 The Dominican population in Washington Heights and nearby Inwood makes up 88,000 of the neighborhoods' nearly 223,000 residents, said Ramona Hernandez, director of the Dominican Studies Institute at the City University of New York.
 Dominican and American flags, often side by side, hang from streetlights along Juan Pablo Duarte Boulevard, which is named for a hero of Dominican independence. There is a strong sense of community, as old neighbors become something like family friends, as even strangers feel comfortable enough to call each other ''Papi.'' The pigeons feed not on bread crumbs but on rice and beans, and people are as likely to shop outside a store as in one, buying clothes, toys and cellphone holders, empanadas dipped in pots of oil and corn on the cob roasted over charcoals in shopping-cart grills.
 The only silver spoons here are the ones a man takes out of a plastic bag and offers to sell cheap to the streetside vendors.
 It is the kind of place where Mr. Bloomberg is described by some as a friend of the rich and an enemy of the poor, while Mr. Ferrer has earned votes because of his working-class roots in the Bronx. ''When they raise the rent $50, he thinks it's 5 cents,'' said Donis Sanchez, 56, a social worker, referring to the mayor.
 Pushing a baby stroller up Broadway one afternoon, Busime Mudekereza, a hospital worker from Congo, said Mr. Bloomberg's policies were not ''good enough for people like me, a low-income family.'' Martin Almonte, 43, a handyman, said: ''The rent's going higher. We have no chance with him.''
 Yet Mr. Bloomberg appeals to many other voters here. While these voters complain about the high cost of living, they are generally happy with the direction the city is going and are not impressed with Mr. Ferrer's record. Mr. Bloomberg ''is a person who knows about doing business,'' said Andres Frias, 53, who works for an insurance company. ''New York is about business.''
 Iris Santos, 31, a public health worker who grew up in the Bronx and Washington Heights, wrote the mayor a letter in August telling him he had her vote. When Mr. Bloomberg wrote back to her, she kept the letter -- ''You made my day!'' reads the typewritten reply, signed by the mayor and dated Sept. 1 -- and the envelope it came in. Ms. Santos said the mayor was a billionaire who could do what he wanted with his time and money, but he has chosen to take on the headache of running New York City and running for re-election. ''The man got money,'' she said. ''He doesn't want more money. He's tough. And we need somebody tough in the city.''
 Ms. Santos' enthusiasm for the mayor illustrates the increasing complexities of the neighborhood's historically Democratic electorate. Over here, in the window of A & A Travel and Services Inc., mixed in with posters promoting Latin singers, is a vote-for-Bloomberg placard. Over there, outside Bab's Sportswear Inc., one of Mr. Ferrer's posters is on display. 
 There is Amir Barber Shop, near the corner of West 181st Street and Audubon Avenue, operated by Amir Santiago, 42, who is Dominican, has a black belt in karate and encourages customers to vote for Mr. Bloomberg, though Mr. Santiago is unable to vote himself, since he is not an American citizen. It is a common quandary on these streets, yet it does not prevent people from forming passionate opinions about one candidate or another. ''He's a hard-working man,'' Mr. Santiago said of Mr. Bloomberg. ''He made his money.''
 And then there is Maria O. Flores, an elderly Panamanian woman who proudly wears a square blue Bloomberg pin on her sweater. ''I'm Bloomberg, Bloomberg, Bloomberg,'' she explained as she walked near the intersection of West 175th Street and Broadway recently.
 People have a fierce pride about voting here. In the Democratic primary in September, the average election district in the city had only a 15 percent turnout of registered Democrats, but in Washington Heights, that percentage was at roughly 24 percent, said John H. Mollenkopf, director of the Center for Urban Research at the City University of New York Graduate Center.
 Mr. Ferrer, who is of Puerto Rican descent, has certainly earned support among Dominicans and Puerto Ricans here. Maria Reynosa said she was voting for Mr. Ferrer because ''he's Hispanic.''
 ''He knows what the Spanish people need,'' she said.
 Raymond Espaillat, 54, leaned on a parking meter on Broadway and said Mr. Ferrer would get his vote. Mr. Bloomberg has been a good mayor but, ''Hispanics, we go with Hispanics,'' said Mr. Espaillat, who lives in Washington Heights and works at a nursing home in the Bronx.
 Other Hispanic voters said they felt no ethnic loyalty to Mr. Ferrer. Diana Ponce-Cwiekalo, 37, a freelance illustrator on a trip to Washington Heights from Riverdale, in the Bronx, is Puerto Rican, and undecided. She said she had not heard Mr. Ferrer articulate a strong message about what he would do for the middle class. ''It's more about class than race,'' she said.
 Mr. Frias, the insurance company representative who is voting for Mr. Bloomberg, said he had nothing against Mr. Ferrer. As a Dominican, he said it would be great if New York finally elected a Latino mayor. But, he said, that does not mean that ''Hispanics have to vote for a person just because he talks like us, he looks like us and he's Hispanic like us.'' Mr. Frias and others said the mayor had made frequent appearances in the neighborhood, and they noted with pride that he had made several trips to the Dominican Republic over the years.
 Some were not as impressed by the mayor's attempts to reach out to the community. Ms. Sanchez, the social worker supporting Mr. Ferrer, said Mr. Bloomberg's use of Spanish in his public appearances and his advertisements rang hollow to her. ''It's not enough to be bilingual,'' she said. ''You have to be bicultural. Ferrer is bilingual and bicultural.''

HEADLINE: What's He Really Worth?

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY L. O'BRIEN

 BODY:
For decades, Donald Trump, America's most effervescent rich guy, has made his wealth a matter of public discourse. But sometimes his riches are hard to find. This article was adapted from ''TrumpNation: The Art of Being the Donald,'' by Timothy L. O'Brien, a reporter for The New York Times. The book, to be published on Wednesday by Warner Books, looks inside Mr. Trump's wallet.
 BY 1993, with his casinos in hock, most of his real estate holdings either forfeited or stagnant and his father slipping into the fog of Alzheimer's disease, Donald Trump, at the age of 47, had run out of money. There were no funds left to keep him aloft, and as the bare-bones operation he maintained in Manhattan started to grind to a halt, he ordered Nick Ribis, the Trump Organization's president, to call his siblings and ask for a handout from their trusts. Donald needed about $10 million for his living and office expenses, but he had no collateral to provide his brother and sisters, all three of whom wanted a guarantee that he would repay them. 
The Trump children's anticipated share of their father's fortune amounted to about $35 million each, and Donald's siblings demanded that he sign a promissory note pledging future distributions from his trust fund against the $10 million he wanted to borrow. 
 Donald got his loan, but about a year later he was almost broke again. When he went to the trough the second time, he asked his siblings for $20 million more. His brother Robert Trump, who briefly oversaw Donald's casinos before fleeing the pressure of working for him to take over their father's real estate operation, balked. Desperate to scrape some money together, Donald tasked Alan Marcus, one of his advisers, to contact his brother-in-law John Barry and see if he could intervene with Robert and his other siblings.
 ''John and I spoke about it a few times,'' Mr. Marcus told me. ''In fact, we spoke about it in the conference room in Trump Tower. John then went around and addressed it with the family.''
 Mr. Marcus said that Mr. Barry successfully lobbied other members of the Trump clan and that another handout was arranged, with Donald agreeing again that whatever he failed to pay back would be taken out of his share of their father's estate.
 ''We would have literally closed down,'' said another former member of the Trump Organization familiar with Donald's efforts to keep the company afloat. ''The key would have been in the door and there would have been no more Donald Trump. The family saved him.''
 Donald disagreed with this version of events. ''I had zero borrowings from the estate,'' he told me. ''I give you my word.'' Donald's brother, Robert, did not respond to repeated interview requests. Mr. Barry is deceased. His widow, Maryanne Trump Barry, a federal judge, said that she could not recollect any efforts to offer her brother financial help. Donald's other sister, Elizabeth, was unavailable for comment.
 But Mr. Marcus and two other executives who worked closely with Donald all said the family's financial lifeline gave the developer the support he needed to get through the rough waters separating his early years of overblown, overhyped acquisitions and the later years of small, sedate deals preceding his resurrection on ''The Apprentice.'' Both of Donald's parents died during that time, he parried with Ivana Trump in a bitter divorce battle that hinged on properly valuing his dwindling assets, he remarried and divorced again, and then he did what anyone else in his situation would do when confronted with limited options: he ran for president of the United States.
 Before Donald could get to Phase 2 of his career, he had to muscle his way through the dismantling of his business empire and a thorny financial restructuring with his bankers and bond holders that left him on the precipice of personal and corporate bankruptcy. As bankers who once fell over one another to throw money at him now lined up for their share of what was left over, Donald scrambled to hang on to whatever he could while maintaining his facade as America's most savvy entrepreneur. And in terms of maintaining his popular mojo, Donald proved remarkably resilient.
 ''When I was in trouble in the early 90's, I went around and -- you know, a lot of people couldn't believe I did this because they think I have an ego -- I went around and openly told people I was worth minus $900 million,'' Donald recalled. ''And then I was able to make a deal with the banks.''
 To survive a process as tortuous and unpredictable as a debt workout, however, requires a large dose of gumption. Donald had gumption in spades.
 ''You're out there alone. I mean, it's not fun,'' he advised me. ''I went from being a boy wonder, boy genius, to this [expletive] guy who has nothing but problems.''
 Although Donald's brush with bankruptcy separated him from some of his showiest assets and from the banks whose loans had first puffed him up, his penchant for claiming billionairedom remains. To this day, he closely monitors his ranking on Forbes magazine's annual list of America's wealthiest individuals, the Forbes 400, and his ability to float above the wreckage of his financial miscues and to magically add zeroes to his bank account has ensured that he remains an object of fascination. But how much is Donald Trump really worth?
 IN September 1982, with Trump Tower a year away from completion, Forbes published the Forbes 400 for the first time. (In 1918, Forbes produced a list of America's 30 richest people, but that was a one-time event.) Chock-full of anecdotes about how the rich became rich and what they did with their richly deserved riches, the Forbes 400 was financial pornography of the most voyeuristic and delicious sort.
 While there was a refreshing inclusiveness about the list (Mafia treasurer Meyer Lansky made the inaugural tally, for example), some on the roster held rank upon the loosest of foundations. For those whose wealth was based on a stake in a publicly traded company, calculating their Forbes worthiness was relatively straightforward: put a value on their stock. But for those with privately held money who weren't a Rockefeller, Mellon, du Pont or Kennedy, the process of ascertaining fortunes was trickier. Forbes relied on those people to willingly fork over an honest and somewhat exact self-appraisal of their wealth.
 It also turned out that some big buckaroos, understandably averse to receiving an avalanche of phone calls from charities or scamsters that would follow such publicity, loathed being on the list. Nonetheless, the Forbes 400 drew scads of attention from the moment it was published. The list became capitalism's Rosetta stone, a decoding device for divining the American Way. Even prominent economists parsed it for social truths. 
 ''At a trivial level, it is almost impossible not to be interested in Forbes magazine's annual list of the 400 wealthiest individuals, minimum net worth $150 million, and 82 wealthiest families, minimum net worth $200 million,'' wrote Lester Thurow, an M.I.T. economist, in 1984. ''Subconsciously, we read their biographies hoping to find the elixir that will add us to the list. While the elixir -- a rich father -- is to be found (all of the 82 families and 241 of the 400 wealthiest individuals inherited all or a major part of their fortunes), it doesn't help most of us to point this out to our fathers.''
 Professor Thurow added: ''Great wealth is accumulated to acquire economic power. Wealth makes you an economic mover and shaker. Projects will happen, or not happen, depending upon your decisions. It allows you to influence the political process -- elect yourself or others -- and remold society in accordance with your views. It makes you an important person, courted by people inside and outside your family. Perhaps this explains why some people try to persuade Forbes that they are wealthy enough to merit inclusion.''
 This, then, was the dividing line: Those who were secure enough not to reveal their wealth abhorred the Forbes 400, or at least tried to avoid it; those who were less secure, needed to keep score and had their identities wrapped up in the concept of billionairedom turned the list into a white-collar fetish. For the latter group, to be off the Forbes 400 represented emotional and social exile. 
 Donald, paradoxically, was a loner who did not want to live in exile. He was obsessed with the Forbes list. And his propensity for inflation, matched with Forbes's aversion to hiring the sizable staff it might need to assess accurately the wealth of each of its designated 400, got Donald on the magazine's inaugural list in 1982. Forbes gave him an undefined share of a family fortune that the magazine estimated at $200 million -- at a time when all Donald owned personally was a half-interest in the Grand Hyatt hotel and a share of the yet-to-be-completed Trump Tower. 
 Donald and the Forbes 400 were mutually reinforcing. The more Donald's verbal fortune rose, the more often he received prominent mentions in Forbes. The more often Forbes mentioned him, the more credible Donald's claim to vast wealth became. The more credible his claim to vast wealth became, the easier it was for him to get on the Forbes 400 -- which became the standard that others in the news media, and apparently some of the country's biggest banks, used when judging Donald's riches.
 IN some years, Donald insisted on impossibly high figures for his net worth and then, in a faux fit of complaining, settled for an estimate that Forbes convinced itself was conservative -- even though it was often wildly high anyway. The one gap in this mating dance was 1990 to 1995, when Donald didn't appear on the list at all. Forbes was apparently so chastened by the $2.6 billion difference in its estimate of Donald's wealth between 1989 and 1990 that the magazine needed a six-year hiatus before it had the confidence to begin helping him inflate his verbal fortune again.
 Forbes's odes to Donald and his father, Fred Trump, went like this over the years:

1982 Wealth: Share of Fred's estimated $200 million fortune. Forbes explains: ''Consummate self-promoter. Building Trump Tower next to Tiffany's. Angling for Atlantic City casino.'' Forbes quotes Donald: '''Man is the most vicious of animals and life is a series of battles ending in victory or defeat.''' While Forbes estimates that the family's fortune was over $200 million, it says that ''Donald claims $500 million.''

1983 Wealth: Share of Fred's estimated $400 million fortune. (Author note: Observe that although 1982 to 1983 was a particularly brutal recession year, the Trump family's real estate fortune doubles.)

1984 Wealth: Fred has $200 million; Donald has $400 million.

1985 Rank: 51; Wealth: $600 million. (Donald becomes a solo Forbes 400 act; Fred disappears from the list.)

1986 Rank: 50; $700 million.

1987 Rank: 63; $850 million.

1988 Rank: 44; $1 billion.

1989 Rank: 26; $1.7 billion. (Observe that Donald's wealth has grown by $1.1 billion during a four-year period when he was borrowing huge sums to buy money-losing properties.)

1990 Dropped from the list! Forbes explains: ''In 1990 the rich have been getting poorer. Trump is the most noteworthy loser. Once a billionaire, Trump's net worth may actually have dropped to zero.'' (That makes things clearer. Was he ever a billionaire? Maybe his net worth just stayed the same? Maybe it always had been zero?)

1991 AWOL.

1992 AWOL.

1993 AWOL. (These are the times that try men's souls. Hang in there, Donald.)

1994 AWOL.

1995 AWOL.

1996 He's back. Rank: 373; $450 million. Forbes explains: ''Trump, polite but unhappy, phoning from his plane: 'You're putting me on at $450 million? I've got that much in stock market assets alone. There's 100 percent of Trump Tower, 100 percent of the new Nike store -- they're paying $10 million a year in rent!' Add it all up, said Trump, and his net worth is 'in the $2 billion range, probably over $2 billion.''' (Don't worry, Donald. One year from now Forbes will help you find another easy $1 billion.)

1997 Rank: 105; $1.4 billion. Forbes explains: ''Net worth was negative $900 million in 1990, but the Donald now claims to have $500 million in cash alone. Disputes our estimate. 'The real number,' he insists, 'is $3.7 billion.'''

1998 Rank: 121; $1.5 billion. Forbes explains: ''Unstoppable salesman, master of hyperbole. Net worth was negative $900 million in 1990, now claims our estimate is low by a factor of three: 'The number is closer to $5 billion.'''

1999 Rank: 145; $1.6 billion. Forbes explains: ''We love Donald. He returns our calls. He usually pays for lunch. He even estimates his own net worth ($4.5 billion). But no matter how hard we try, we just can't prove it.''

2000 Rank: 167; $1.7 billion. Forbes explains: ''In the Donald's world, worth more than $5 billion. Back on earth, worth considerably less.''

2001 Rank: 110; $1.8 billion.

2002 Rank: 92; $1.9 billion.

2003 Rank: 71; $2.5 billion.

2004 Rank: 189; $2.6 billion. Forbes explains: ''America's love affair with the Donald reaching impossibly new highs; his reality show, 'The Apprentice,' was prime-time television's highest-rated series last year After nearly defaulting on its debt obligations, Trump's gaming properties to reorganize No matter. For Donald, real estate is where his real wealth lies. Over 18 million square feet of prime Manhattan space.''
 Forbes, if not entirely skeptical of Donald, had, of course, grown accustomed to his intense lobbying. ''There are a couple of guys who call and say you're low on other guys,'' said Peter Newcomb, a veteran editor of Forbes's rich list, ''but Trump is one of the most glaring examples of someone who constantly calls about himself and says we're not only low, but low by a multiple.'' Mr. Newcomb said that Forbes works hard to ensure the accuracy of its data but that it also relies on information provided by those whom it surveys. 
 The Forbes 400, of course, has always loomed large in Donald's imagination.
 ''When you think of it, I've been on that list for a long time. I think they work very hard at the list,'' he told me. ''It seems to be that they're the barometer of individual wealth. It doesn't really matter. It matters much less to me today than it mattered in the past. In the past, it probably mattered more.''
 Donald's verbal billions were always a topic of conversation whenever we visited. In my first conversation with him, in 1996, he brought up his billions. When Donald and I spent time together one weekend in Palm Beach, Fla., earlier this year, the subject inevitably came up. Donald had gamely and openly fielded a diverse range of questions all day, so I was curious to see where he would go when we got to money. When I popped the wealth question, he paused momentarily and scrunched his eyebrows. We had reached a crossroads. Out it came. He pursed his lips a little bit. Out it came. He blinked. Out it came, rising up from deep within him. 
 ''I would say six [billion]. Five to six. Five to six,'' he said.
 Hmm. The previous August he told me that his net worth was $4 billion to $5 billion. Then, later that same day that August, he said his casino holdings represented 2 percent of his wealth, which at the time gave him a net worth of about $1.7 billion. In the same day, Donald's own estimates of his wealth differed by as much as $3.3 billion. How could that happen? Was Donald living in his own private zone of wildly escalating daily inflation, a Trump Bolivia? And his $1.7 billion figure in August was well below the $2.6 billion that Forbes would credit him when it published its rich list just a couple of months later. 
 Now Donald was saying he was worth $5 billion to $6 billion. 
 ''Five to six. Five to six.''
 And on the nightstand in my bedroom at Donald's Palm Beach club, Mar-a-Lago, was a glossy brochure that said he was worth $9.5 billion.
 WHEN I sat down in a Trump Tower conference room one afternoon earlier this year with Allen Weisselberg, the Trump Organization's chief financial officer, he claimed that Donald was worth about $6 billion. But the list of assets that Mr. Weisselberg quoted, all of which were valued in very inflated and optimistic terms and some of which Donald didn't own, totaled only about $5 billion. Where might the rest have been? ''I'm going to go to my office and find that other billion,'' Mr. Weisselberg assured me. 
 Did he ever return? No, he never returned. His assessment of Donald's wealth is outlined in the accompanying chart. 
 But Mr. Weisselberg's analysis left me confused. So I asked around for guidance.
 Three people with direct knowledge of Donald's finances, people who had worked closely with him for years, told me that they thought his net worth was somewhere between $150 million and $250 million. (Donald's casino holdings have recently rebounded in value, perhaps adding as much as $135 million to these estimates.) By anyone's standards, this still qualified Donald as comfortably wealthy, but none of these people thought that he was remotely close to being a billionaire. 
 Donald dismissed this as naysaying.
 ''You can go ahead and speak to guys who have 400-pound wives at home who are jealous of me, but the guys who really know me know I'm a great builder,'' he told me.
 However illusory, it was Donald's fixation on billionaire bragging rights and real estate prowess -- in addition to the financial lifeline his siblings tossed to him -- that kept his mojo rising during his brush with financial extinction in the early to mid-1990's. But the Donald who emerged on the other side of his business meltdown was a financial shadow of his earlier, acquisitive, debt-laden self, and would remain so right up to the debut of ''The Apprentice.''
 Financial turmoil, of course, didn't stop Donald from spouting. The all-time howler award for a publication taking his verbal billions at face value belonged to Playboy. In early 1990, just a month before the Taj Mahal opened in Atlantic City and began a financial slide that would take Donald's empire down with it, the magazine profiled the developer and said he had amassed ''a fortune his father never dreamed possible,'' including ''a cash hoard of $900 million'' and a ''geyser of $50 million a week from his hotel-casinos.''
 In the real world, New Jersey casino auditors estimated in public reports that as of September 1990, Donald was worth about $206 million -- almost all of which was tied up in hotels, an airline, casinos and other properties that were devaluing rapidly or about to be taken away from him. Donald's cash on hand was only $17 million, and that was dissolving quickly as well.
 Regulators projected Donald's 1991 income from trusts and rentals at $1.7 million, offset by $9.7 million in debt payments, $6 million in personal business expenses and $4.5 million to maintain his Trump Tower triplex and estates in Greenwich, Conn., and Palm Beach for the year -- meaning that he would be about $18.5 million in the hole at the end of 1991. Regulators projected Donald's income for 1992 to sink to $748,000 and his 1993 income to drop even further, to $296,000 -- with all of his debt payments and personal expenses continuing to pile up. At the end of 1993, his personal cash shortfall would amount to about $39 million and there would still be $900 million in personally guaranteed loans hanging over his head.
 In the midst of all of this, Donald reached a property settlement with Ivana Trump after their divorce. According to a 1991 New Jersey regulatory report, the settlement called for Ms. Trump to get a $10 million payment, the couple's Greenwich estate, $350,000 in annual alimony, $300,000 in annual child support, a $4 million housing allowance, use of some Trump properties and a $350,000 salary for running the Plaza Hotel. Donald didn't have the $10 million to pay his ex-wife; he ended up using part of the $65 million that banks had loaned his business the prior year to pay her, according to regulators who said in their report that the payment to Ms. Trump ''depleted most of Mr. Trump's personal cash.''
 Throughout early 1991 and into the summer, Donald helped his banks begin to dismantle his holdings so he could pay off $3.4 billion in business debt and release himself from the $900 million in personal arrears attached to that pile. Absent an overhaul, Donald would be wiped out. 
 The little ray of sunshine in all of this for Donald was that the real estate collapse sweeping the country in the early 1990's left banks with wads of bad loans in their coffers. They could choose to put their borrowers out of business and be left owning companies they didn't want to run, or force debtors into messy bankruptcy proceedings that would involve paying whopping legal fees and suffering through years of delays. Neither alternative appealed to the banks. 
 ''That was sort of the bottom of the heap. Deep trouble. They could have really done a big number. There was a personal guarantee on the loan,'' Donald told me. ''My father was a pro. My father knew, like I knew, you don't personally guarantee. So I wrote a book called 'The Art of the Deal,' which as you know is the biggest of all time. In the book, I say, 'Never personally guarantee.'''
 But, Donald added, ''I've told people I didn't follow my own advice.''
 Donald's enthusiasm for the Forbes 400 also waned during his flirtation with bankruptcy. In his sequel to ''The Art of the Deal,'' a book called ''Trump: Surviving at the Top,'' he offered a new take on his view of a rich list to which he no longer belonged.
 ''It always amazed me that people pay so much attention to Forbes magazine,'' wrote Donald, who always paid a lot of attention to Forbes magazine. ''Every year the Forbes 400 comes out, and people talk about it as if it were a rigorously researched compilation of America's wealthiest people, instead of what it really is: a sloppy, highly arbitrary estimate of certain people's net worth.''
 DONALD managed to weather the slings and arrows of doubters during these lean years and hunkered down with his bankers and with his debts. As the negotiations progressed, Donald's bankers looked for every alternative they could find to bankruptcy, because none of the banks wanted to contend with the mess that would ensue if the talks collapsed. And the Trumpster kept singing a happy tune. ''He was always upbeat,'' recalled Harvey Miller, a lawyer representing Citibank. ''One thing I'll say about Donald, he was never depressed.''
 Unbeknownst to his creditors, Donald was just as worried about a bankruptcy as they were. He later told me that he wanted to avoid bankruptcy at all costs because he felt that it would permanently taint him as a failure or a quitter.
 Sanford Morhouse, a lawyer representing Chase Manhattan bank in the Trump negotiations, said: ''I did a lot of workouts in those days on behalf of Chase, with a lot of real estate developers who had similar problems, and big ones. Almost all of them, at one point or another in that era, filed for bankruptcy protection. And Donald, to his credit, did not.''
 Donald whittled down his mammoth personal debts by forfeiting most of what he owned. Chase Manhattan, which lent Donald the money he needed to buythe West Side yards, his biggest Manhattan parcel, forced a sale of the prized tract to Asian developers. Though Donald would claim after the yards were sold that he remained a principal owner of the site, property records did not list him as such. 
 According to former members of the Trump Organization, Donald did not retain any ownership of the site's real estate -- the owners merely promised to give him about 30 percent of the profits once the site was completely developed or sold. Until that time, the owners kept Donald on to do what he did best: build. They gave him a modest construction fee and a management fee to oversee the development. They also allowed him to slap his name on the buildings that eventually rose on the yards because his well-known moniker allowed them to charge a premium for their condos. 
 Retained for his building expertise and his marquee value, Donald was a glorified landlord on the site; he no longer controlled it. (Earlier this year, the owners negotiated to sell the site without consulting Donald; terms of the prospective sale are in dispute.)
 EVEN as the national real estate bubble was bursting, fresh funds began rushing onto Wall Street, fueling a historic run-up in both the stock market and initial public offerings of often barely viable companies. If you had a good story and a prominent name, it suddenly became quite easy to sell stock. And it turned out, against all odds, that investors were willing to gamble on Donald's name -- even though they were getting a chief executive whose sense of his responsibilities as the steward of a publicly traded company and the guardian of other people's money was somewhat ill defined.
 ''Something gnawed at me, and I knew what it was -- the whole head-of-a-public-company routine,'' Donald wrote in ''Surviving,'' relating his previous experience as a manager of Resorts International. ''Although I certainly agreed with the theory of stockholder-owned corporations and was absolutely committed to fulfilling my fiduciary duties, I personally didn't like answering to a board of directors.''
 In a tribute to the sucker-born-every-minute theorem, Donald managed to take two of the Trump casinos public in 1995 and 1996, at a time when he was unable to make his bank payments and was heading toward personal bankruptcy. The stock sales allowed Donald to buy the casinos back from the banks and to unload huge amounts of debt. The offering also yanked Donald out of the financial graveyard and left him with a 25 percent stake in a company he once owned entirely. Trump Hotels and Casino Resorts traded at $14 a share initially and, along with a fresh bond offering, the new company raised about $295 million. 
 Exactly what investors thought they might get for their Trump Hotels investment wasn't entirely clear. Donald had already demonstrated that casinos weren't his forte, and investors were buying stock in a company that was immediately larded with debts that made it difficult, if not impossible, to upgrade the operations. Even so, Trump Hotels' shares rose to about $36 in 1996, giving Donald a stake worth about $290 million. With little real estate left to speak of in Manhattan, Donald's wealth was centered on his casinos.
 But in subsequent years Trump Hotels' stock price tanked. Had Donald tried to pare down some $1.8 billion in debt smothering the casino company and spruced up the operation, he might have ridden a reignited gambling boom and grown his newly seeded fortune. Instead, Trump Hotels, which never earned a profit in any year between 1995 and 2005, became Donald's private stockpile of ready cash. In 1996 alone, Trump Hotels' shares fell to $12 from $35.50. About a decade later, the New York Stock Exchange delisted the shares entirely and any kid with a quarter could buy the stock. (Trump Hotels recently reorganized as Trump Entertainment Resorts; it now carries $1.2 billion in debt, and Donald's stake in the company is worth about $135 million.) 
 When I interviewed Donald in 1996, he was effusive about his casinos and somehow seemed to forget that he owned relatively little Manhattan property at the time.
 ''Donald Trump is in two businesses,'' he told me. ''I have this huge company that's real estate. I also have this huge company that's gambling. So I have two huge companies.''
 Donald continued to carve out a niche for himself in New York real estate as the manager of other people's properties. In 1994, General Electric was looking for someone to refurbish the old Gulf & Western building on Columbus Circle in Manhattan, and retained Donald. Presto, the renovated skyscraper was christened Trump International Hotel and Tower. Even though Donald didn't own the building, it later flashed across the opening credits of ''The Apprentice'' as if he did.
 And Donald did scramble back to gain control of some other Manhattan buildings, including 40 Wall Street, which he spent about $35 million to buy and refurbish in 1996. The building has about $145 million in debt attached to it, and New York City tax assessors currently value the property at about $90 million. Donald values it at $400 million. 
 Donald's recent golf course ventures have produced some sterling new properties, but the values he assigns those deals appear to be hyper-inflated. Donald's Palm Beach course, for example, has about 285 members who paid $250,000 for memberships, for a total of $71.25 million. Donald borrowed about $47 million to build the course and a new clubhouse. So he banked about $24 million on the deal, before other costs. He leases the land beneath the course from Palm Beach County; he doesn't own it. But Donald carries the course on his books as an asset worth $200 million.
 Forbes, in bestowing a $2.6 billion fortune on Donald in its 2004 rich list, credited him with owning 18 million square feet of Manhattan property, which certainly is an impossibility. On one occasion, Donald told me that the West Side yards, which he doesn't own, would have 10 million square feet of salable space when the site, now known as Riverside South, was completed. (Mr. Weisselberg told me, alternatively, that the site would have about five million square feet of salable space.) However measured, the yards were by far the biggest property in Donald's former Manhattan real estate portfolio -- but he no longer owned the tract. 
 Between 2000 and 2004, Forbes allowed Donald's verbal billions to grow by $1 billion. The jump came during a period when the stock market bubble burst, Donald's stake in his casinos -- one of his most valuable assets until ''The Apprentice'' came along -- had fallen in value to $7 million and, despite Manhattan's red-hot real estate market, he owned much less real estate there than he let on.
 Donald said his casinos' myriad problems -- no profits, suffocating debt, disappearing cash -- did not mean that he had failed in Atlantic City. Instead, he described his management of the casinos as an ''entrepreneurial'' success, defining ''entrepreneurial'' as his ability to take cash out of the casino company and use it for other things. 
 ''Entrepreneurially, not as a person who drives up stock, but as a private person, it's been a very good deal,'' he told me. ''If I would have worked Atlantic City the way I worked real estate, I would probably be the biggest casino company in the world rather than just a nice company, et cetera, et cetera.''
 Two weeks ago, Forbes published its 2005 list of America's wealthiest people. Donald held 83rd place with what Forbes described as a $2.7 billion fortune. ''My net worth has tripled,'' Donald told the magazine.

HEADLINE: Conundrum Beat

BYLINE: By William Safire.

 BODY:
Readers have mock-bitterly complained about a half-hidden pun in a recent column item about the rising use in the United States of the Britishism twee, meaning ''quaint, overly cute.'' After castigating punsters like the new chief justice for the insulting telegraphing of, or sly apologizing for, a pun, I oh-so-subtly concluded with ''poems are made by fools like me, but.. . .'' That left it to readers not paranoid about paronomasia to make the leap to Joyce Kilmer's poem about God's creation of, or intelligent design of, trees.
A pun is to wordplay what dominatrix sex is to foreplay -- a stinging whip that elicits groans of guilty pleasure. The word paranomasia, based on the Hellenic Greek for ''to alter in naming,'' has for five centuries been used in English to describe a play on words that sound alike; the poet Alexander Pope in 1741 wrote of ''the Paranomasia, or Pun, where a Word, like the tongue of a jackdaw, speaks twice as much by being split.'' The technique drew reproof five years later from the novelist Tobias Smollett: ''Debauched from sense, let doubtful meanings run/The vague conundrum and the prurient pun.'' 
 Now to a service for sophisticated investors, hottie hedge-fund managers, bond bulls and other adventurous debenturers: the mysterious meaning of conundrum.
 The need for our etymological investigation was triggered by Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve System. Interest rates on long-term borrowing usually move in the same direction as short-term borrowing; when the Fed raises short-term rates, as it has been doing for nearly three years, most bond traders expect long-term rates like 30-year mortgages to go up, too. But they have not. Why?
 Greenspan, in testimony before a Senate committee on Feb. 16, 2005, observed an anomaly in the economic figures: ''For the moment, the broadly unanticipated behavior of world bond markets remains a conundrum.'' 
 In the synonymy of perplexity, the choices of nouns were taken over by Winston Churchill, who described Russia as ''a riddle wrapped in a mystery inside an enigma.'' That leaves puzzle, now associated with games, and puzzlement reminds us of the Siamese king in ''The King and I.'' Greenspan could have chosen the participles bewildering, baffling, befuddling, perplexing or even stupefying, but those verb forms functioning as adjectives go too far toward admission of being wholly stumped. The Fed, as an institution, can admit candidly to a degree of uncertainty about the economic future but not adopt an attitude of cluelessness. 
 Since that first financial use of the unfamiliar word, ''the Greenspan conundrum'' has become as familiar as his 1996 phrase to describe the frenetic run-up in the stock market as ''irrational exuberance.'' The first step in solving the interest-rate puzzlement is to understand the terminology.
 ''I must ha' my crotchets! And my conundrums!$(2$) shouted the title character in ''Volpone,'' a famous 1605 play by Ben Jonson, Shakespeare's leading competitor. (That's where crotchety came from, an adjective that descriptive usagists apply to me with increasing frequency and which I take as a compliment.) From the start, conundrum was closely associated with paranomasia. A minister in 1645 was criticized for wordplay in his sermons, ''which in Oxford they call conundrums. . .and a pair of dice is made a Paradice.'' The technique was further derogated in 1704: ''Pun and conundrum pass with them for wit.'' The philosophical anarchist William Godwin, who at first scorned the feminist Mary Wollstonecraft and later married her, wrote in ''Caleb Williams,'' his 1794 novel: ''Zounds! Sir, do not think to put any of your conundrums upon me.''
 At that time of the Enlightenment, the O.E.D. reports, the word gained a sense of ''a riddle in the form of a question the answer to which involves a pun or play on words.'' (That punning riddle, called two centuries ago ''a conundrumical question,'' has a modern version familiar to punning music lovers: ''What is the question to which '9W' is the answer?'' The answer-question to that conundrum: ''Do you spell your name with a V, Herr Wagner?'')
 In modern times, the punning sense of conundrum atrophied, unfortunately for wordplayers, leaving only the sense of helpless speculation. The meaning is now ''a question whose answer can only be guessed at.'' Where in antiquity did Ben Jonson find the word? Lexicographers throw up their harmlessly drudging hands and say, ''Origin obscure.'' Like Greenspan's honest head-scratching about the direction of long-term interest rates, the etymology of conundrum can best be described by itself. 

Avian Flu Pandemic
 A frightening phrase that we'll be seeing plenty of in coming weeks is avian flu pandemic, which the World Health Organization warns is ''imminent,'' a word meaning ''about to occur.''
 Pandemic, an adjective from the Greek pandemos, ''of all the people,'' becomes a noun to mean ''the outbreak of a disease spreading over a large geographic area,'' now construed as ''worldwide.'' Epidemic, disease visited on a large segment of a population, is now considered regional rather than global.
 Influenza, the Italian word for ''influence,'' was adopted by English in 1743 based on the widespread belief that epidemics were caused by the influence of the stars. Flu is the shortening first used by the poet Robert Southey in an 1839 letter, spelled ''Flue'' and later used in 1951 by the poet W.H. Auden: ''28 Little birds with scarlet legs,/Sitting on their speckled eggs,/Eye each flu-infected city.''
 Auden knew his Latin: carriers of a certain type of flu are birds. Avian is the English adjective from the Latin avis, ''birds,'' just as aviary is a large enclosure for them. 
 In current usage, avian flu is used interchangeably with bird flu; both are semantically correct. The word avian, however, is sometimes mistaken for Asian (an area where bird-to-human transmission of the strain of influenza virus has been reported, though subsequent human-to-human transmission is rare). That's why bird flu may be a better name for the threat.

HEADLINE: Shrinking the Culture Gap at Merrill

BYLINE: By JENNY ANDERSON

 BODY:
STILL settling into his new job at AXA Financial, Robert J. McCann was preparing for a meeting at 7:55 on a warm August morning in 2003 when the phone rang in his Midtown Manhattan office. His assistant answered it and told him that Stan was on the phone. Thinking that the call was from a colleague down the hall, Mr. McCann told his assistant to relay that he was on his way.
 ''It's not that Stan,'' she said. ''It's Stan O'Neal'' -- E. Stanley O'Neal, the chairman, chief executive and president of his former employer, Merrill Lynch.
Thus began one of Wall Street's more unusual second acts. Mr. McCann, who had left Merrill only five months earlier after 21 years there, listened to Mr. O'Neal ask him to return to the bank as a vice chairman overseeing wealth management, research and asset management. After discussing it with Mr. O'Neal over dinner at the River Club, Mr. McCann took the job without even asking what it would pay. (He later learned how much from the human resources department.) 
 Mr. O'Neal created the position for Mr. McCann amid the kind of headline-grabbing power struggle that Wall Street executives hate -- and the rest of the world loves. Two of Mr. O'Neal's lieutenants had tried to stage a coup to make one of them second in command. After it failed, one of the men was fired, and the other was given the chance to resign, which he did.
 The tumult left a void in the upper ranks of Merrill just as the company was in the middle of a reinvention that many people inside the firm saw as messy -- and too harshly imposed by Mr. O'Neal. Mr. McCann was known to have been uncomfortable with the executives responsible for the coup attempt; with them gone, and jobs to fill, the stage was set for his return.
 In many ways, Mr. McCann was an ideal hire. As a Merrill veteran with close ties to the alumni ranks, he was a bridge from Merrill's past as a friendly, if bloated, financial supermarket to Mr. O'Neal's vision of an efficient, if somewhat cold, money machine. By bringing Mr. McCann back, Mr. O'Neal, who declined to comment for this article, was able to put a friendlier face on Merrill -- inside the company and to the world -- and to signal that he believed Merrill had a culture that extended beyond cost cutting. 
 In Mr. McCann, he would also get a lieutenant who was generally unapologetic about Merrill's rich past and predictably bullish about its future, someone who would strive to deliver the numbers while trying to create -- dare it be said? -- an appealing place to work.
 ''McCann is like a bridge between the two cultures,'' said James Quigley, the vice chairman of Merrill Lynch International and a 22-year veteran of the firm. ''He's a people person and he's got a lot of loyal followers and he is excellent at managing the business.''
 The deal seems to have worked. The two main divisions he oversaw upon his return to Merrill -- the global private client business, which manages individuals' accounts, and asset management, which manages money for institutions and wealthy individuals -- prospered under the executives who were running them. In June, Mr. O'Neal put Mr. McCann directly in charge of the global private client unit. The unit, a $10 billion business, manages $1.4 trillion for individual investors. 
 Merrill Lynch's army of 14,690 brokers has long distinguished the firm from most of its Wall Street peers, which make most of their money catering to institutions and trading oil contracts rather than by connecting with individuals and their savings. Mr. McCann, however, will run the private client unit not because it is the heart of Merrill's past but because it is crucial to its future: Mr. O'Neal has indicated that he wants the unit to generate half of the company's revenue, up from less than a third today.
 Mr. McCann has moved quickly to make his mark on the business, reorganizing the battalions of brokers, scooping up teams of financial advisers and closing a number of joint ventures, including one that gives Merrill Lynch a significant presence in Japan. The private client business, along with Merrill's other units, is now thriving, and Merrill's most recent two quarters put to rest, for the time being, critics' accusations that Mr. O'Neal knew how to cut costs but not how to make the firm grow.
 Mr. McCann's test over the next few years will be to expand the already well-oiled private client business, make its brokers more productive, attract additional clients abroad and keep turning a profit -- all while managing the rough and tumble of ambitious managers and trying to please a boss often described as aloof.
 IF he succeeds, Mr. McCann, 47, will improve his chances of climbing that final rung to the top of Merrill. While Mr. O'Neal, who is 54, has not indicated any intention to leave, on Wall Street it is never too early to gauge the political landscape. Other potential successors include Do Woo Kim and Gregory J. Fleming, who run the firm's powerful investment banking and trading operations, or possibly Ahmass L. Fakahany, the chief administrative officer. Traditionally, Merrill's president has been the heir apparent. Mr. O'Neal has chosen to hold that job himself -- and may continue to do so, creating a quiet horse race.
 Mr. McCann, of course, says he is focused on the job he has. ''I now have the opportunity to run a business that has 32,000 people in it, 600 offices and is a $10 billion business,'' he said. ''That's a wonderful and exciting challenge.''
 In many ways, Merrill's long history has been upended by its recent one. For decades, it was a brokerage firm that operated around the country and managed money for individuals. In the 1980's and 90's it became a global giant but eventually grew bloated and overextended. Through each of its iterations, it was a collegial place run by people who grew up in the firm and were devoted to it. ''These guys had bulls on the bottom of their swimming pools,'' said Mr. McCann, referring to the company's famous logo.
 At its height, Merrill topped the league tables, the rankings closely watched by Wall Street firms. In 1999, it ranked second in global mergers and acquisitions, third in profits from global trading of equities and equity-linked derivatives, and fifth in underwriting bonds of risky companies, according to Thomson Financial. Senior executives recall a place that was hard-driving but fun. 
 ''I had the opportunity to see it metamorphize from pure retail stock and bond operation to a globally integrated financial services firm,'' said David H. Komansky, the chairman of Merrill from 1997 through April 2003. ''It was a constant case of evolving and it had an esprit de corps and familiar feeling that was valued by a lot of people. It could take on any challenge.''
 That esprit de corps did not end with the rise of Mr. O'Neal but rather with the bursting of the technology bubble -- and the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, which knocked Merrill out of its headquarters in the World Financial Center, across the street from the twin towers, for seven weeks. While those events affected all of Wall Street, Merrill was staggered more than most: because it had grown so fast, it had to take extreme measures.
 Under Mr. O'Neal, who had edged Mr. Komansky out of the chairman's suite, Merrill pared about a third of its work force, or 23,500 jobs, from 2000 to 2003. (By way of comparison, Goldman Sachs shed 14 percent of its work force.) Cuts were across the board. And as Merrill restructured its work force, the industry continued to change, leaving the firm in some ways on the sidelines. For example, while banks embraced electronic trading to help them manage the fast-changing equities business, Merrill remained focused on expense management. ''They tried to kill the franchise but they couldn't,'' said one former Merrill executive who spoke only on condition of anonymity because he now works for a competitor.
 Merrill fell in the league tables, and dozens of employees either were forced out or walked out, saying they were unnerved by what they called Mr. O'Neal's cold and calculated approach to the business and put off by his perceived disdain for Merrill's past.
 But Mr. O'Neal's frosty revolution produced results. Merrill's net revenue in 2004 was $22 billion, still less than the record revenue in 2000 of $26.4 billion. But profits in 2004 were $4.4 billion, far better than the $3.4 billion posted in 2000. The firm ended last year with a 26.5 percent pretax profit margin, a significant improvement over 18.9 percent at the height of the bull market. It has been on an acquisition spree.
 ''When I initiated coverage of Merrill in 2001, I wrote that it was a very overweight coach potato in need of a run around the track,'' said Charles Hintz, a securities industry analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein. ''O'Neal has done a good job of getting the company up and running around the track.''
 While Merrill has made significant gains this year -- it used the word ''record'' more than a dozen times in a press release about its third-quarter earnings -- some analysts say the firm still has a way to go. ''Clearly they delivered some of the broad-based growth investors have been waiting for the past couple of years, and progress has improved,'' said Glenn Schorr, a securities analyst at UBS, ''but there's still a reasonable gap versus its peer group, so there is still work to be done.''
 It will be up to Mr. McCann and his peers to close that gap.
 MR. McCANN did not come from Wall Street roots. Known as Bobby to his friends, he was born in Pittsburgh, the oldest of two boys in a middle-class family. He earned a bachelor's degree in economics at Bethany College in West Virginia, then an M.B.A. at Texas Christian University. 
 Though intense and extremely driven, Mr. McCann seems to aspire not to be a swashbuckling master of the universe but just a normal guy with authority in a powerful and high-profile industry. Married with two children, he lives and vacations in New Jersey; like many on Wall Street, he is passionate about golf and has a handicap of 10.
 Colleagues and competitors describe Mr. McCann as emotionally intelligent, a managerial quality that can be rare on Wall Street. He uses his ability to communicate with people -- clients and employees alike -- to make them feel good about themselves and about Merrill, and to solidify his own position in the firm. ''Bob connects with people,'' said one senior financial adviser who declined to be identified, citing the company's policy that employees cannot speak to the press. ''At the end of the day, our assets are our people and the best leaders are people oriented.''
 During his first decade at Merrill, Mr. McCann worked as an equities trader and then a manager, but it was his skills with people that propelled his career. When the Persian Gulf war started in 1991, for example, Mr. McCann was on the trading floor at 6 a.m., trying to navigate markets that were going berserk. ''It was a lot of fun,'' Mr. McCann recalled recently.
 Mr. Komansky, who was his boss at the time, also remembered the day well. ''It was the single most exciting moment I have had in the equities business, watching him orchestrate that,'' he said, adding that he convinced Mr. McCann to become a manager. ''After spending time with him it was so obvious that he was the Pied Piper of a large extended group of traders.''
 Mr. McCann's leadership skills and cool head would come in handy several more times -- when, for example, he represented Merrill during the Wall Street-wide bailout of the Long Term Capital Management hedge fund in 1998, and when he had to clean up after the 2001 investigation of Merrill's stock analysts by Eliot Spitzer, the New York attorney general. Mr. Spitzer sued Merrill, accusing it of issuing positive research to win investment banking deals, and released e-mail messages in which Merrill analysts made fun of stocks they had recommended to investors. ''It was a bombshell,'' Mr. McCann said. The inquiry later spread to all of Wall Street, but as the first one named, Merrill drew much criticism.
 Over a period of weeks, Mr. McCann, who had been named the head of research only four months before the scandal broke, talked to those analysts -- in small groups or in town meetings -- to convince them that their careers were not ending. ''He was really excellent at keeping analysts apprised,'' said Rosemary T. Berkery, an executive vice president and general counsel. ''You had people who were waking up wondering how their careers would be altered, and Bob understood the human element of that.''
 As Mr. McCann navigated the firm through the research debacle, he wanted to do more, but Mr. O'Neal did not offer him the opportunity. One morning in early 2002, Mr. McCann's wife, Cindy, was startled to find him at home at 8 a.m., long after he normally left for the office. He had decided to leave Merrill.
 That spring, more than 150 friends and colleagues, including Mr. O'Neal, honored him at Bayard's, a restaurant near Wall Street, closing the Merrill Lynch chapter of his life. One longtime friend, Brian Hull, had enlarged a photograph of Mr. McCann, which revealed him standing on tiptoe to look taller than his friends. (Mr. McCann, who is 5-foot-9, often jokes about his height, and the photo was greeted with laughter.) 
 ''When I left, I was comfortable with what I had done and how I'd done it,'' Mr. McCann said. ''I wasn't angry; I wasn't mad at anybody.''
 WHEN he returned to Merrill, his management skills were quickly put to the test. For one thing, he was put in charge of two units whose leaders had been reporting directly to Mr. O'Neal; losing direct access to the chief executive and chairman was an apparent demotion for them, and potentially a morale killer.
 He forged a good relationship with James Gorman, who had successfully managed a turnaround in the private client business, more than doubling its profitability and sharply reducing turnover -- an important issue for managers who don't want their employees to walk out the door with all of their clients and the assets they manage.
 Mr. McCann quickly absorbed the challenges of the private client business at a time of great change in the industry. In a speech to the Investment Management Consultants Association in April, he said that rather than buying and selling stocks, a ''churn'' business, financial advisers were now expected to figure out how to manage multiple mortgages, hedge against a real estate bubble, navigate hedge funds and seek out tax-advantageous solutions for savings -- at the same time that the advisers were managing more money for more clients. 
 He reorganized the sales force last month and has overseen a number of acquisitions, including Merrill's first purely retail purchase in the United States: the $400 million acquisition of Advest from AXA Financial, adding 515 brokers. This month, he helped to close a deal in which Merrill will partner with the Mitsubishi Tokyo Financial Group to cater to wealthy Japanese citizens with more than $1 million to save or invest. 
 The private client business will continue to change rapidly, and industry insiders will look to Merrill to see whether it changes the way it compensates its brokers -- shifting to salaries and bonuses from a system of credits and commissions -- and to try to prevent top brokers from setting up on their own to make more money. 
 While it is too early to measure Mr. McCann's results, he strives to shake things up. In July, when an arbitration panel ruled that Merrill Lynch had to reinstate E. Hydie Sumner, a former employee who had successfully sued the firm for sexual discrimination, Mr. McCann drafted a letter to employees, which he rewrote many times.
 ''While we have some questions regarding the legal foundations of the panel's ruling and are weighing our options, I want to be very clear: we have only ourselves to blame for this situation,'' he wrote in the final draft. ''Ms. Sumner was subjected to conduct that was unacceptable and offensive. That is inexcusable. Management's response at the time failed to effectively punish those responsible.'' 
 The language in the letter was far stronger than had been used by the firm, but he stands behind it. ''If you are going to damage the reputation of this company, you must be held accountable,'' Mr. McCann said about the events. 
 There are mixed feelings among the many Merrill veterans who watched the firm change overnight. ''A lot of people say it was great then and it's not now,'' Mr. Komansky said. ''I don't see it that way. It adapts to the times.''
 Mr. McCann seems to agree. He says he was never angry at Mr. O'Neal for not initially giving him a bigger job. He seems a great advocate of Mr. O'Neal's accomplishments -- a fact tempered by the reality that Mr. O'Neal is his boss. ''It was a change that was not limited to just resizing and refocusing the company,'' Mr. McCann said. ''We would not have a $62 stock price and we would not be the company we are today if Stan wouldn't have led that change.''

HEADLINE: Transforming Bronx Terminal Market, but at a Steep Price

BYLINE: By CHARLES V. BAGLI and ROBIN SHULMAN

 BODY:
When Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg campaigns in the backyard of his opponent, Fernando Ferrer, he points to a 32-acre eyesore just south of Yankee Stadium as a prime example of his desire to bring jobs and prosperity to the oft-neglected Bronx.
 The mayor praises the planned redevelopment of the Bronx Terminal Market by a private developer as a project that will transform broken streets and crumbling buildings into a shiny $394 million shopping mall with thousands of jobs and hefty tax revenues, using city land and seed money.
The vision is a grand one: 1 million square feet of box stores like Home Depot and Target, tree-lined streets, curbside restaurants, a waterfront park and smooth highway exits in the shadow of baseball's most famous landmark. And the administration has pursued it with the sort of impatience for bureaucracy and delay that have been trademarks of Mayor Bloomberg's all-business approach to economic development.
 Even many Democratic officials in the Bronx have embraced the Republican mayor's plan, which is wending its way through the city's approval process. And Mr. Ferrer has been only mildly disapproving. 
 But other critics say the administration may have gone too far this time, that the market's potential as a retail center is so promising that the city did not need to provide the deep subsidies it did. Similar malls in Brooklyn, Queens and the Bronx have been booming successes without them, according to the critics, who include real estate executives, urban planners and the current tenants of the market.
 Representative Anthony D. Weiner has described the project's level of tax breaks, cash grants and city guarantees as a sweetheart deal. The developer, Stephen M. Ross, chairman of Related Companies and the city's busiest developer, is a close friend and a former business partner of Daniel L. Doctoroff, the city's deputy mayor for economic development.
 ''You don't have to subsidize retail development in a hugely underserved market like the Bronx,'' said Jonathan Bowles, research director for the Center for an Urban Future, which analyzes urban policy issues, and who has generally lauded the mayor's economic development policies. ''They gave away the store here.'' 
 The city often provides developers in struggling neighborhoods with incentives, including low-interest loans, tax-free bonds and tax breaks. In addition to tax breaks, Related is getting more than $14 million in cash grants that a similar project in Harlem did not get, as well as the equivalent of a money-back guarantee if the developer fails to get the zoning he says he needs. That benefit, Andrew Alper, president of the city's Economic Development Corporation, acknowledged was unusual and possibly unprecedented.
 Still, Mr. Alper, Mayor Bloomberg and Mr. Doctoroff scoff at the charge of favoritism, saying the administration should get credit for removing a landlord with whom the city has often been in court and resolving thorny problems at the blighted market that had stymied mayors for 25 years.
 ''The Bronx is far better off having Related put $400 million of capital into building a retail market that creates thousands of jobs,'' Mr. Alper said. ''We have no downside to this transaction whatsoever, which is why every single official in the Bronx supports it strongly.''

Evicting the Merchants
 Not exactly. Helen Diane Foster, a City Council member from the Bronx, has criticized the city's effort to evict the market's two dozen Caribbean, African and Central American wholesale produce merchants. Ms. Foster, whose family used to buy its Christmas tree there and whose father bought produce and provisions for his restaurant at the market, said, ''While we need economic development, I don't know that we need it at the expense of the merchants.''
 ''An even larger issue is how the deal was cut,'' she said. 
 Some vendors have accepted financial assistance from the city and Related and have agreed to leave. But Stanley Mayer, president of the merchants' association, whose members say they employ 400 people and do about $400 million a year in business, says the city has failed to find a new home for them all. They are suing to stop their eviction.
 ''We're not against development,'' Mr. Mayer said. ''We just want to be part of the development. It's a deal between billionaires. They say it creates jobs. But what about our jobs?''
 The dilapidated market, built 85 years ago, remains one of the largest centers in the city for ethnic fruits and vegetables. Italian immigrant vendors have yielded to Puerto Rican, and more recently, African, merchants, despite the conditions. In 1972, the city leased the market to a developer, David Buntzman, and over the next 30 years repeatedly tried to wrest the 99-year lease from Mr. Buntzman as the market fell into disrepair and the number of tenants dwindled.
 The city ultimately lost a bitter legal battle with the developer in the late 1990's and, with Mr. Buntzman claiming damages of up to $100 million, agreed to meet with a mediator.
 When the Bloomberg administration inherited the problem in 2002, Mr. Doctoroff turned to his friend Mr. Ross for free advice on the desirability of redeveloping the market as a way to resolve the standoff with Mr. Buntzman. After the meeting, Mr. Ross said he and Mr. Doctoroff did not discuss the Bronx Terminal Market for a long time. 
 But by the end of the year, Mr. Ross was exploring a deal to buy out Mr. Buntzman and develop the site. The deal was not finalized until April 2004, but the circumstances gave rise to charges of favoritism.
 Mr. Ross and Mr. Doctoroff had been business partners in the past and Mr. Ross shared in his friend's passionate quest for the 2012 Olympics. Only days before Mr. Doctoroff took office, Mr. Ross agreed to guarantee a loan to the Olympic committee, NYC2012, that allowed it to repay Mr. Doctoroff $3.2 million in personal funds he had lent the group.
 Mr. Doctoroff later asked the city's Conflicts of Interest Board to determine whether he could meet and negotiate with Mr. Ross. The board cleared the way, but Mr. Doctoroff said he recused himself from direct negotiations with Mr. Ross.
 Still, as The Village Voice first reported, Mr. Doctoroff's meeting and telephone logs show he closely followed the Terminal Market talks, meeting at least eight times with the mediator, Richard Ravitch, or members of his staff working on the deal. He also met frequently with Mr. Ross and talked to him by telephone, although the logs do not indicate the subject of their discussions. 
 City officials working under Mr. Doctoroff were not passive spectators to the deal; they had to approve the transfer of the lease from Mr. Buntzman to Related and the benefit package for the developer.
 ''It had to be a three-party deal,'' said Jeffrey Blau, a top executive at Related. ''The city had the right to approve any transfers of the lease.''

No Bids Requested
 City Councilman Hiram Monserrate of Queens and others contend that the city should have solicited bids for redeveloping the market, especially since the Bloomberg administration was suggesting a radical change in the use of the property.
 Mr. Doctoroff and Mr. Alper say that is nonsense, since Mr. Buntzman, then 94, or his estate would have controlled the lease for decades to come and was antagonistic to the city. The city had lost a legal case, they say, and might have had to pay Mr. Buntzman tens of millions of dollars in damages. The deal between Mr. Ross's company and Mr. Buntzman was a private transaction, they said. 
 ''We were about to go to trial on the damages,'' Mr. Alper said. ''The estimate was that we would have to pay$50 million to $100 million, potentially. In the end, Buntzman still would have had the lease until 2052.''
 It is unclear, however, whether the situation was that dire. In a 2003 memo, city lawyers estimated the potential liability as but a small fraction of Mr. Buntzman's $100 million claim. The department declined to discuss the memo.
 ''In any litigation, there are obviously differing perspectives of a claim's value or legitimacy,'' said Kate O'Brien Ahlers, a spokeswoman for the department. ''However, we're not prepared to discuss details of the city's assessment in the context of settlement discussions.''
 Mr. Alper, who said he had never seen the memo, insisted the deal with Related was a good one, whether the city faced damages of $10 million or $100 million, because they were rid of a ''bad landlord.'' The city could have tried to condemn Mr. Buntzman's lease, as some critics urged, Mr. Alper said, but that probably would have resulted in yet another long legal battle, with no resolution in sight.
 In any event, Mayor Bloomberg announced the market deal in April 2004, saying it ''would not only remove this blight,'' but would create excellent retail space, an inviting waterfront esplanade, thousands of jobs for residents of the area and enormous tax revenues.
 Aside from the sort of tax breaks given to developers for major projects outside of Midtown Manhattan, the city also provided $7.2 million for the demolition of existing buildings on the site and $7.1 million in relocation funds for existing merchants.
 The city also agreed to trade the Bronx Men's House of Detention, a parcel adjacent to the market, for waterfront land that Mr. Doctoroff then hoped would be used for an Olympic velodrome. It did so without what former economic development executives say is the routine practice of obtaining appraisals of the relative values of the land being exchanged. The Olympic campaign collapsed in July, and Related now has the option of buying that land from the city.
 In the meantime, Related has agreed to transfer 7.5 acres of waterfront land at the eastern end of the market to the city for a park, in return for a $2.5 million rent credit.

Or Your Money Back
 The city set the rent for the property at $250,000 during an initial 63-month period. When the mall opens, the rent will jump to $500,000 or 2 percent of gross revenues, whichever is greater, rising over 15 years to 5 percent of gross revenues. Some real estate executives and the tenants at the market say the rent schedule seems low. 
 But what really caught the attention of other developers and economic development executives was the Bloomberg administration's willingness to repay the developer what it has paid Mr. Buntzman, $42.5 million, if Related fails to get the zoning it seeks. Critics say that amounts to a money-back guarantee and eliminates much of the developer's risk, when combined with the other elements of the deal.
 ''I wish the city would give me a deal like that,'' said David Blumenfeld, vice president of the Blumenfeld Group, which is developing a $300 million big box mall in East Harlem called East River Plaza. ''They're getting a lot more than I'm getting.''
 Mr. Alper said the terms were the best the city could get. If Related fails to get the zoning, he said, the city will finally regain control of the property for $42.5 million, not the tens of millions of dollars it might have had to pay Mr. Buntzman in damages while he retained control of the lease.
 Development executives acknowledge it is often difficult to gauge how much is too much and city officials often suffer second-guessing from people unfamiliar with the full complexity of a situation.
 But it is clear that box stores have been successful in New York City, as the crowds at Queens Center Mall or at Related's Gateway Center in East New York, Brooklyn, can attest. Related's Bronx project, Gateway Center at Bronx Terminal Market, will be similar to its mall in East New York and is in a similarly distressed neighborhood, close to highways.
 Real estate brokers and consultants say that gross sales at Costco, Old Navy, Home Depot, Target and Lowe's in the city are 50 to 100 percent higher than at the chain stores in the suburbs.
 ''They want to get into all the boroughs in New York City very badly,'' Allen Cooperman, a broker with Welco Realty, said of box stores. ''They probably do twice as much in the boroughs as they do nationally.''
 Mr. Bowles of the Center for an Urban Future said Related was smart to cash in on the trend. But for the city, he said, ''it doesn't require a tremendous level of incentives to make these projects go forward.''

Because of an editing error, an article on Monday about critics' claims that Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg erred in promising a developer generous incentives to transform the Bronx Terminal Market into a shopping mall misstated the developer's middle initial in some copies.

 BODY:
WHITHER EUROPE? -- A meeting of European Union leaders on Thursday is shaping up as another budget squabble, with overtones of anxiety over Europe's moribund economy. The host of the gathering, Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain, right, hopes progress can be made in balancing Britain's proposal to scale back farm subsidies that benefit countries like France with French and German demands for a reduction in Britain's annual budget rebate. 

DOWN TO THE WIRE -- Europe's protectionist agricultural policy -- not just its $50 billion in subsidies to farmers but also its high tariffs on imports -- is creating quite a trans-Atlantic row. The United States says Europe's refusal to bend is threatening the future of world trade talks, scheduled to resume in Hong Kong in December. Developing countries want both the United States and Europe to open their markets wider, and Washington is proposing steeper reductions in subsidies and tariffs than capitals like Paris are prepared to accept. The European Community is expected to come up with a revised offer later this week.

HIGH-TECH TRAVEL -- Starting Wednesday, all passports issued by the 27 countries participating in the United States Visa Waiver Program, which allows business travelers and tourists to enter the country for up to 90 days without obtaining a visa, must display a digital photo of the holder. Passports produced before then are still valid, however.

FEAR VERSUS GREED -- For investors spooked by both inflation fears and the prospect of a housing market correction, clarification on whether to buy or sell is on the way. Figures for last month's sales of existing homes are due out tomorrow and for new homes on Thursday, while the latest store sales, plus two consumer-confidence indexes, will be reported tomorrow. Durable-goods orders for September will be reported on Thursday. Third-quarter gross domestic product numbers come out Friday.

SLOWING DOWN -- Earnings reports will ease a little from last week's pace; many companies will report results but fewer big names are among them. Here are the highlights: Today, American Express, Merck, Texas Instruments; tomorrow, BellSouth, DuPont, International Paper, Northrop Grumman, U.S. Steel; Wednesday, Boeing, ConocoPhillips, Lucent; Thursday, Exxon Mobil, Microsoft, Verizon.

WISDOM FROM ON HIGH -- The Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan, is speaking a couple of times this week, in Kansas City on Wednesday, after receiving the Harry S. Truman Medal for Economic Policy, and in Houston on Thursday after a ceremony for the new Federal Reserve branch building.

HEADLINE: Why You Should Pay To Read This

BYLINE: By DAVID CARR

 BODY:
IN a bedroom in New Jersey, there is a shrine to Entertainment Weekly. A 17-year-old who lives there -- that would be my daughter Erin -- has the magazine's covers on her wall, and she divines a film's artistic value and business prospects with close readings of the magazine.
 She gets Entertainment Weekly free, courtesy of her father, who receives copies at the office. Every once in a while I come home empty-handed, and when Erin recently complained about my spotty delivery, I mentioned that she could just go up the street and plunk down $3.50, the same as everybody else. 
''Like I'm going to do that,'' she said, adding a majestic eye-roll for emphasis. 
 Like many of her age and experience, Erin gets music free, her My-Space account is free, and she can surf for whatever else she needs. She and her twin sister use the timer on the VCR to record their favorite shows and then skip the commercials, just like TiVo (except they would have to pay for that). When I recently bought the paid online version of The U.S. News and World Report's college resource, she and her sister Meagan acted as if I had fallen for a Ponzi scheme. 
 Their message was clear: only suckers pay for content.
 YOU could chalk up their attitude to youthful insouciance, but many of the country's biggest media companies, including its newspapers, subscribe to the corollary: only losers charge for content. 
 This month, Clarity Media, backed by the billionaire Philip F. Anschutz, is introducing The Baltimore Examiner, the third free daily the company owns, along with newspapers in San Francisco and Washington. Knight Ridder just purchased a chain of eight no-charge papers in Silicon Valley. 
 More than half a million free newspapers are handed to commuters in New York every day, in the form of amNew York and Metro, and in Washington, The Washington Post faces daily competition from two freebies including one owned by The Washington Post. 
 The New York Times is producing a new movie magazine, OnMovies, to be distributed free at selected theaters, and Niche Media, a chain of free city magazines that includes Gotham and LA Confidential, added two new magazines last month with Boston Commons and Capitol File in Washington. 
 Free has worked handily before -- radio and television have the billions to show for it. But in giving away content to match the Web's unrecompensed goodies, traditional print media is eating its own lunch. 
 We have been through this before, back in 1999, with everyone rushing to harvest eyeballs and then worrying about making them cash-flow later. But this time around, at least on the Web, there is a business model that involves search, targeted advertising and the ability to scale. 
 Free on the Web is one thing --Flickr for pictures, Slate for news analysis, Craigslist for classifieds -- but taking free into the offline world of paper, delivery and vendors means scale, the grail of the race for eyeballs, and that adds to expense. If a Web site achieves a growing audience, it simply beefs up servers and serves up more ads. If a free print product catches on, its publisher has to deal with beefy union delivery drivers and serving up more expensively milled dead trees.
 And it has to deal with something else: consumers who value its publication at exactly zero dollars and zero cents. During the dot-com delirium, many people fondly quoted Stewart Brand, the founder of The Well and The Whole Earth Catalogue, saying ''Information wants to be free.'' 
 Chris Anderson, the editor in chief of Wired magazine (newsstand price: $4.95) who is writing a book about media consumption titled ''The Long Tail,'' reminded me that people always leave out the second part of that quote: ''Information wants to be free because it has become so cheap to distribute, copy and recombine -- too cheap to meter. It wants to be expensive because it can be immeasurably valuable to the recipient. That tension will not go away.''
 And it has not. Many print publications -- magazines like The New Yorker, The Atlantic and The Economist, along with newspapers like The Wall Street Journal -- require their readers to plunk down real money to access their contents. It may or may not cover costs, but it is meaningful revenue in more ways than one.
 Part of the reason some traditional media cling to charging is that the revenues derived from consumers have symbolic significance -- what the author Rafi Mohammed, in his book ''The Art of Pricing,'' called ''the belief of value.'' 
 Magazines that use subscription and newsstand purchases as an index of ''wantedness'' typically pay more to acquire readers than they collect, which makes little economic sense. But paid content addresses the issue of time poverty, the real challenge of contemporary print media. If they buy it, the thinking goes, they will read it. 
 Right now, consumers, especially younger ones, believe that they have already paid. A family of five, and we are not naming names here, spends $4,000 a year to access broadband, cellphone and cable coverage and would be fools to pay more. Yes, pay for the pipes and what goes through them, but not a penny more. Traditional media has to make a case -- perhaps by starting small, as iTunes did at 99 cents a song -- that some things in the pipe are worth spending for, too.
 ''Free ultimately expands markets,'' said Michael Wolf, senior director of the media and entertainment practice at McKinsey & Company. ''Consumers recognize the difference between what they pay for and what they get free. Free can coexist alongside paid media and serve very different needs and markets.''
 Earlier this month at the Web 2.0 conference, John Battelle, an author of a book on search and one of the organizers of the conference, empaneled a group of teenage consumers that he assembled (at no charge, by placing an ad on Craigslist). They dutifully admitted that they did not pay for music or news or video, but most said they still spent $40 to $60 a month on media. 
 So what medium finally cracked the code on youthful intransigence? 
 Ring tones, available for now only from their wireless providers. Now if I can just figure out how to render this column as an electronic tone poem, I can get in on the action.

HEADLINE: Pharmacies Endorse Crackdown On Fraud

BYLINE: By Bob Tedeschi

 BODY:
WHEN the dot-com bubble burst five years ago, hundreds of would-be Internet kingpins exited the industry in shame. But at least they were not wearing handcuffs.
 The same cannot be said for the online merchants caught in the latest bust -- this one of a swindle, not a bubble. Late last month, federal drug investigators shut down 4,600 illegal Internet pharmacy sites and arrested 18 people who ran them from locations across the United States. 
The authorities stopped short of claiming that the crackdown dismantled the illegal online market for Viagra, Propecia, Oxycodone and other black-market medications, but they said it could scare off some sellers who had operated with impunity for years. Law-abiding online pharmacies like Drugstore.com, KwikMed.com and others hope so, because driving out the bad eggs could mean more sales for them.
 ''The rogue pharmacies siphon off sales from legitimate consumers who happen to have a prescription,'' said Greg French, a spokesman for Drugstore.com. ''But the more significant issue is the impact they have on the reputation of legitimate players.'' 
 Some consumers are avoiding Drugstore.com and other bona fide providers, Mr. French said, because they are unsure which sites are legitimate. With a little bit of graphic design flair and some HTML artistry, it is easy enough for unlicensed drug sellers to pass themselves off as being aboveboard. 
 To discerning viewers, though, the fraudulent sites are easy to spot. Many of the shuttered online stores purported to offer prescriptions by legitimate doctors, following ''safe and secure'' online diagnoses. These typically took the form of a short questionnaire -- with the right answers already checked off -- asking about the patient's symptoms and general health.
 The form would then supposedly be sent to the site's licensed physician, who would write a prescription and forward it to a licensed pharmacist. In reality, many of the Web sites would either fill the orders themselves or send them to an illegal wholesaler for a commission.
 The profits could be huge. Garrison Courtney, a spokesman for the United States Drug Enforcement Administration, which led the recent investigation, said customers typically paid $400 for drugs that would have cost $40 with a legal prescription.
 What that means is that the customers who patronized these sites could not or would not get the prescriptions from their own doctors. That being the case, legitimate sites may not see much of a sales bump from the demise of so many black-market pharmacies, according to Lynne Bishop, a health industry analyst with Forrester Research, an online consulting firm. ''These are two very different markets,'' Ms. Bishop said. People who buy prescription drugs from lawful sites, she said, tend to be ''in touch with costs, quality, researching medications and medical conditions, and they'll bring these types of issues to their doctor.''
 Not only are online prescription-drug customers rare; they seem to be growing rarer. So far this year, about 8 percent of America's 150 million prescription-drug users have bought their medications online, down from 8.6 percent last year.
 Ms. Bishop said online prescriptions might well be headed for an uptick, but it would not be because of drug busts. Rather, she said, the supply of illegal prescription drugs is shrinking as drug manufacturers crack down on unscrupulous distributors and step up efforts to authenticate drugs. At the same time, insurers are encouraging and sometimes even requiring customers to fill their prescriptions on the Internet as a way to cut costs. Some legitimate online pharmacists say the government's pursuit of Internet outlaws is already helping the bottom line. 
 ''Our business is increasing with the crackdown on these sites,'' said Peter Ax, the chief executive of KwikMed, a privately held Scottsdale, Ariz., pharmacy that sells drugs for erectile dysfunction and baldness. ''People are seeking out the legitimate providers.''
 KwikMed appeals to those who are too embarrassed to see a doctor or to pick up prescriptions at the drugstore counter. KwikMed.com features a questionnaire devised by a real physician, requiring customers to answer anywhere from 20 and 200 questions.
 If KwikMed's doctors determine that a patient needs a prescription, they issue one and an outside pharmacist ships the medicine. (Adult signatures are required at the time of delivery, to verify the patient's identity and age.) If the doctors conclude that a prescription is not warranted, the site records data like the applicant's address, which can help KwikMed thwart further efforts by the same person to get pills.
 KwikMed, which Mr. Ax said was a rogue pharmacy until he bought it for an undisclosed price in 2001, claims it is unique in its ability to issue online prescriptions without a physical examination. That distinction comes courtesy of the State of Utah, which in 2003 issued the company a license to operate after reviewing KwikMed's diagnostic software and medical procedures.
 The site's prices are higher than traditional pharmacies charge. A 20-pill bottle of Viagra, for instance, costs roughly $300, compared with about $220 in a drugstore. Patients pay nothing for the online exam.
 Mr. Ax, who was once head of the Lehman Brothers' private equity division, said his company might eventually expand its roster of drugs, but not anytime soon. ''We'll only do it if we can operate under lawful guidelines with regulators working with us,'' he said. ''But we think we have a vision for what the nontraditional delivery of medicine can be.
 ''And if we do things right, the bad guys who are less than ethical will go away, and our business will increase.''

Much of the used computer equipment sent from the United States to developing countries for use in homes, schools and businesses is often neither usable nor repairable, creating enormous environmental problems in some of the world's poorest places, according to a report to be issued today by an environmental organization.
 The report, titled ''The Digital Dump: Exporting Reuse and Abuse to Africa,'' says that the unusable equipment is being donated or sold to developing nations by recycling businesses in the United States as a way to dodge the expense of having to recycle it properly. While the report, written by the Basel Action Network, based in Seattle, focuses on Nigeria, in western Africa, it says the situation is similar throughout much of the developing world.
''Too often, justifications of 'building bridges over the digital divide' are used as excuses to obscure and ignore the fact that these bridges double as toxic waste pipelines,'' says the report. As a result, Nigeria and other developing nations are carrying a disproportionate burden of the world's toxic waste from technology products, according to Jim Puckett, coordinator of the group. 
 According to the National Safety Council, more than 63 million computers in the United States will become obsolete in 2005. An average computer monitor can contain as much as eight pounds of lead, along with plastics laden with flame retardants and cadmium, all of which can be harmful to the environment and to humans.
 In 2002, the Basel Action Network was co-author of a report that said 50 percent to 80 percent of electronics waste collected for recycling in the United States was being disassembled and recycled under largely unregulated, unhealthy conditions in China, India, Pakistan and other developing countries. The new report contends that Americans may be lulled into thinking their old computers are being put to good use.
 At the Nigerian port of Lagos, the new report says, an estimated 500 containers of used electronic equipment enter the country each month, each one carrying about 800 computers, for a total of about 400,000 used computers a month. The majority of the equipment arriving in Lagos, the report says, is unusable and neither economically repairable or resalable. ''Nigerians are telling us they are getting as much as 75 percent junk that is not repairable,'' Mr. Puckett said. He said that Nigeria, like most developing countries, could only accommodate functioning used equipment. 
 The environmental group visited Lagos, where it found that despite growing technology industries, the country lacked an infrastructure for electronics recycling. This means that the imported equipment often ends up in landfills, where toxins in the equipment can pollute the groundwater and create unhealthy conditions.
 Mr. Puckett said the group had identified 30 recyclers in the United States who had agreed not to export electronic waste to developing countries. ''We are trying to get it to be common practice that you have to test what you send and label it,'' he said. 
 Mr. Puckett also said his group was trying to enforce the Basel Convention, a United Nations treaty intended to limit the trade of hazardous waste. The United States is the only developed country that has not ratified the treaty.
 Much of the equipment being shipped to Africa and other developing areas is from recyclers in the United States, who typically get the used equipment free from businesses, government agencies and communities and ship it abroad for repair, sale or to be dismantled using low-cost labor. 
 Scrap Computers, a recycler in Phoenix, has eight warehouses across the United States to store collected electronics before they are shipped to foreign destinations, and Graham Wollaston, the company's president, says he is opening new warehouses at the rate of one a month. Mr. Wollaston, who describes his company as a ''giant sorting operation,'' said there was a reuse for virtually every component of old electronic devices: old televisions are turned into fish tanks for Malaysia, and a silicon glass shortage has created huge demand for old monitors, which are turned into new ones. ''There's no such thing as a third-world landfill,'' Mr. Wollaston said. ''If you were to put an old computer on the street, it would be taken apart for the parts.''
 Mr. Wollaston said the system was largely working, though he conceded that some recyclers dump useless equipment in various developing nations, most notably China. ''One of the problems the industry faces is a lack of certification as to where it's all going,'' he said. He says his company tests all equipment destined for developing nations.
 The Environmental Protection Agency concedes that ''inappropriate practices'' have occurred in the industry, but said it did not think the problem should be addressed by stopping all exports. 
 ''E.P.A. has been working with the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development countries for the last several years on development of a program that would provide much greater assurance that exports of recyclable materials will be environmentally sound,'' Tom Dunne, of the agency's Office of Solid Waste and Emergency Response, wrote in an e-mail message.

HEADLINE: Gas Taxes: Lesser Evil, Greater Good

 BODY:
There's no serious disagreement that two major crises of our time are terrorism and global warming. And there's no disputing that America's oil consumption fosters both. Oil profits that flow to Saudi Arabia and other Middle Eastern countries finance both terrorist acts and the spread of dangerously fanatical forms of Islam. The burning of fossil fuels creates greenhouse emissions that provoke climate change. All the while, oil dependency increases the likelihood of further military entanglements, and threatens the economy with inflation, high interest rates and risky foreign indebtedness. Until now, the government has failed to connect our crises and our consumption in a coherent way. That dereliction of duty has led to policies that are counterproductive, such as tax incentives to buy gas guzzlers and an overemphasis on increasing domestic oil supply, although even all-out drilling would not be enough to slake our oil thirst and would require a reversal of longstanding environmental protections.
 Now, however, the energy risks so apparent in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina have created both the urgency and the political opportunity for the nation's leaders to respond appropriately. The government must capitalize on the end of the era of perpetually cheap gas, and it must do so in a way that makes America less vulnerable to all manner of threats -- terrorist, environmental and economic. 
The best solution is to increase the federal gasoline tax, in order to keep the price of gas near its post-Katrina highs of $3-plus a gallon. That would put a dent in gas-guzzling behavior, as has already been seen in the dramatic drop in the sale of sport-utility vehicles. And it would help cure oil dependency in the long run, as automakers and other manufacturers responded to consumer demand for fuel-efficient products. 
 Still, raising the gas tax would be politically difficult -- and for very good reasons. The gas tax, which has been at 18.4 cents a gallon since 1993, is painfully regressive. It hits hardest at poor people for whom fuel costs consume a proportionally larger share of their budgets; rural dwellers for whom truck-driving over long distances is an everyday activity; and the gasoline-dependent middle class, particularly suburban commuters, who, on top of living far from their workplaces, have been encouraged by decades of cheap gas to own large, poor-mileage vehicles. 
 Fortunately, those drawbacks can be overcome. A bolstered gas tax would raise huge amounts of revenue, roughly $1 billion for every penny of additional tax. Some of that money would have to be used to provide offsetting tax breaks to low-income households, such as an increase in the earned income tax credit. Another offset that lawmakers could consider would be to use some of the revenue to buy back S.U.V.'s. The buyback notion is a variation on the ''scrappage'' idea from earlier crises, when it was proposed that the government buy up old clunkers so that their owners could more quickly upgrade to less-polluting cars. Eventually, the gas tax would pinch consumers less, as revenues from it are used to finance long-term structural changes to reduce oil dependency, including mass transit and research into alternative fuels and technologies. 
 There is a also a good possibility that, over time, higher gas taxes would not hurt consumers as much as is generally feared. Oil exporters dread gas taxes because the higher gas prices go, the greater the incentive for companies and governments to invest in alternatives. For that reason, economists assume that raising the gas tax -- say, by a dollar or so -- would not necessarily raise the price at the pump by the same amount. Rather, a tax increase could induce exporters to allow the price of oil itself to fall, in order to keep the price at the pump below the level at which oil alternatives begin to look attractive. 
 ''We know that the days of unlimited, inexpensive gasoline are over,'' William Clay Ford Jr., chairman and chief executive of the Ford Motor Company, said last week. So be it. Cheap gas is no longer compatible with a secure nation, a healthy environment or a healthy economy -- if ever it was. The real question is whether we should continue paying the extra dollar or two per gallon in the form of profits to the Saudis and other producers, or in the form of taxes to the United States Treasury, where the money could be used to build true energy independence.

HEADLINE: Wal-Mart To Expand Health Plan For Workers

BYLINE: By MICHAEL BARBARO

 BODY:
Wal-Mart, which has long been criticized for the benefits it offers to its workers, is introducing a cheaper health insurance plan, with monthly premiums as low as $11, that the company hopes will greatly increase the number of its employees who can afford coverage. 
 Jumping into a new area, Wal-Mart is also offering health savings accounts, which the federal government introduced last year. Few employers offer them.
The new benefits, which Wal-Mart calls the Value Plan, follow years of complaints that at Wal-Mart, the nation's largest employer, health insurance is out of reach for many of its 1.2 million workers in the United States, forcing thousands of them to turn to state-sponsored programs or forgo health coverage altogether. 
 ''We are lowering the costs to make health insurance more affordable,'' said a Wal-Mart spokesman, Dan Fogleman, who declined to comment on how much the plan would cost the company. Asked if the new insurance plan was in response to growing criticism, he said, ''It's fair to say we are listening, but more so to our associates than anyone else.'' 
 Health insurance specialists generally praised the new plan, saying its lower premiums were likely to attract more employees and thereby reduce the ranks of the uninsured. They also noted, however, that the plan's $1,000 deductible would be high for Wal-Mart workers, particularly older employees who are likely to visit doctors more often, and might not cover expensive treatments, particularly in its first year.
 While the company has not yet formally announced the changes, workers have been given details to enroll in the plan starting in 2006, and Wal-Mart's chief executive, H. Lee Scott Jr. will discuss it in an address to company employees this morning. Currently, fewer than half of Wal-Mart's workers are covered by company health insurance, compared with more than 80 percent at Costco, its leading competitor. The company declined to estimate how many additional workers would be covered under the new plan.
 The changes will be closely watched by Wall Street and Wal-Mart investors, who will want to know how the company can afford to offer lower-priced benefits at a time when soaring health care costs are pinching profits across the country.
 Wal-Mart said that under the plan, monthly premiums would cost between 40 percent and 60 percent less than those for any existing Wal-Mart insurance policy, and that individuals could visit a doctor three times before paying a deductible, an arrangement aimed at encouraging workers to seek preventive care. In the past, workers have had to pay a deductible before their insurance kicked in.
 Those who participate will pay a $1,000 deductible, the maximum under Wal-Mart's insurance for 2005. Monthly premiums will be, on average, less than $25 for an individual, $37 for a single parent and $65 for a family. The $11 premium, for individuals, will be available in a handful of areas, Mr. Fogleman said. 
 But the plan is unlikely to cover a complicated illness or expensive hospital stay during the first year, when there is a $25,000 insurance cap. (The cap is lifted for the second year.) Out-of-pocket payments range from $300 for prescriptions to $1,000 for hospital stays.
 The company's health savings accounts will combine low monthly premiums with a requirement that individuals cover a substantial part of their own health care costs. Given its size, Wal-Mart's endorsement of the concept may prompt other companies to re-evaluate the accounts. 
 Several health insurance specialists questioned whether the company, which is working to burnish its public image, was trying to quickly increase the number of workers who use its health insurance at the expense of the coverage's quality. 
 ''Is it the greatest health care plan in the world? Probably not,'' said Howard Berliner, a professor of health policy at the New School for Social Research. ''But my concern is getting people health insurance so they can get health care when they need it. In that sense, anything that speeds that goal is for the better.''
 Uwe E. Reinhardt, a health economist at Princeton University, said that by allowing workers several visits to the doctor before requiring them to pay out of pocket, Wal-Mart had ''removed a big financial barrier between doctors and patients,'' adding that critics ''would have trouble attacking this plan.''
 But analysts cautioned that the new insurance plan would prove a better fit for workers who are young and healthy than those who are older and more vulnerable to illness. A 60-year-old Wal-Mart employee, they noted, might visit a doctor three times in a one month and then need to pay $1,000 before the company would share the cost of care. Given that many Wal-Mart employees are paid less than $19,000 a year, the deductible ''is pretty significant,'' said Charles N. Kahn, president of the Federation of American Hospitals. 
 Tracy Sefl, a spokeswoman for Wal-Mart Watch, a coalition of community groups that has been highly critical of the retailer, had not seen details of the plan, but said that ''a plan that is characterized as a healthy person's plan doesn't fully address the needs of a majority of their work force.''
 Ms. Sefl said the introduction of health savings accounts, which allow workers to make tax-deductible payments to a health care fund, was largely impractical for the chain's employees. ''The majority of their work force will not be well positioned to contribute,'' she said. 
 Even as they commended Wal-Mart for offering a more affordable health insurance plan, some industry watchers expressed surprise that the company waited as long as it did to offer a more affordable option. ''We have a health care system in this county that assumes people will be covered by their employer,'' said Mr. Kahn. ''If the biggest employer in the country isn't providing some kind of affordable and meaningful coverage, that is a problem.''

HEADLINE: Behind Gold's Glitter: Torn Lands and Pointed Questions 

BYLINE: By JANE PERLEZand KIRK JOHNSON; Somini Sengupta contributed reporting from New Delhi for this article.

 BODY:
There has always been an element of madness to gold's allure.
 For thousands of years, something in the eternally lustrous metal has driven people to the outer edges of desire -- to have it and hoard it, to kill or conquer for it, to possess it like a lover.
In the early 1500's, King Ferdinand of Spain laid down the priorities as his conquistadors set out for the New World. ''Get gold,'' he told them, ''Humanely if possible, but at all costs, get gold.''
 In that long and tortuous history, gold has now arrived at a new moment of opportunity and peril. 
 The price of gold is higher than it has been in 17 years -- pushing $500 an ounce. But much of the gold left to be mined is microscopic and is being wrung from the earth at enormous environmental cost, often in some of the poorest corners of the world.
 And unlike past gold manias, from the time of the pharoahs to the forty-niners, this one has little to do with girding empires, economies or currencies. It is almost all about the soaring demand for jewelry in places like China and India, which consume 80 percent or more of gold mined today.
 The extravagance of the moment is provoking a storm among environmental groups and communities near the mines, and forcing even some at Tiffany & Company and the world's largest mining companies to confront uncomfortable questions about the real costs of mining gold.
 ''The biggest challenge we face is the absence of a set of clearly defined, broadly accepted standards for environmentally and socially responsible mining,'' said Tiffany's chairman, Michael Kowalski. He took out a full-page advertisement last year urging miners to make ''urgently needed'' reforms.
 Consider a ring. For that one ounce of gold, miners dig up and haul away 30 tons of rock and sprinkle it with diluted cyanide, which culls the rock from the gold. Before they are through, miners at some of the largest mines move a half million tons of earth a day, pile it in mounds that can rival the Great Pyramids, and drizzle the ore with the poisonous solution for years. 
 The scars of open-pit mining on this scale endure. 
 A months-long examination by The New York Times, including tours of gold mines in the American West, Latin America, Africa and Europe, provided a rare look inside an insular industry with a troubled environmental legacy and an uncertain future.
 Some metal mines, including gold mines, have become the near-equivalent of nuclear waste dumps that must be tended in perpetuity. Hard-rock mining generates more toxic waste than any other industry in the United States, according to the Environmental Protection Agency. The agency estimated last year that the cost of cleaning up metal mines could reach $54 billion.
 A recent report from the Government Accountability Office chastised the agency and said legal loopholes, corporate shells and weak federal oversight had compounded the costs and increased the chances that mining companies could walk away without paying for cleanups and pass the bill to taxpayers.
 ''Mining problems weren't considered a very high priority'' in past decades, Thomas P. Dunne, the agency's acting assistant administrator for solid waste and emergency response, said in an interview. ''But they are a concern now.''
 With the costs and scrutiny of mining on the rise in rich countries, where the best ores have been depleted, 70 percent of gold is now mined in developing countries like Guatemala and Ghana. It is there, miners and critics agree, that the real battle over gold's future is being waged. 
 Gold companies say they are bringing good jobs, tighter environmental rules and time-tested technologies to their new frontiers. With the help of the World Bank, they have opened huge mines promising development. Governments have welcomed the investment. 
 But environmental groups say companies are mining in ways that would never be tolerated in wealthier nations, such as dumping tons of waste into rivers, bays and oceans. People who live closest to the mines say they see too few of mining's benefits and bear too much of its burden. In Guatemala and Peru, people have mounted protests to push miners out. Other communities are taking companies to court. 
 This month a Philippine province sued the world's fifth-largest gold company, Canada-based Placer Dome, charging that it had ruined a river, bay and coral reef by dumping enough waste to fill a convoy of trucks that would circle the globe three times.
 Placer Dome, which also runs three major mines in Nevada, answered by saying that it had ''contained the problem'' and already spent $70 million in remediation and another $1.5 million in compensation. 
 Some in the industry have paused to consider whether it is worth the cost -- to the environment, their bottom line or their reputations -- to mine gold, which generates more waste per ounce than any other metal and yet has few industrial uses. 
 The world's biggest mining company, Australia-based BHP Billiton, sold its profitable Ok Tedi mine in Papua New Guinea in 2001 after having destroyed more than 2,400 acres of rainforest. Upon leaving, the company said the mine was ''not compatible with our environmental values.'' 
 After tough lessons, other companies, like Newmont Mining, the world's largest gold producer, are paying for more schools and housing, trying harder to ease social problems around its mines.
 ''I don't think any of our members want to be associated with a bad operation -- notwithstanding it would hurt their ability to open new facilities,'' said Carol L. Raulston, spokeswoman for the National Mining Association. ''News goes around the world quickly now and there is no place to hide.''
 Critics say corporate miners have been cloistered from scrutiny because of their anonymity to consumers, unlike, say, oil companies, which also extract resources but hang their name over the pump. 
 Last year the mine watchdog group Earthworks began a ''No Dirty Gold'' campaign, marching protesters in front of fashionable Fifth Avenue storefronts, trying to change gold mining by lobbying gold consumers.
 ''They just said to ask where the gold was coming from and whether it caused social or environmental damage,'' said Michael E. Conroy, senior lecturer and research scholar at the Yale University School of Forestry and Environmental Studies. ''The repercussions in the mining media were huge -- some said it was all lies, but retailers began to realize what their vulnerability was.''
 Mr. Kowalski, Tiffany's chairman, has tried to stay ahead of the controversy. He has broken new ground by buying Tiffany's gold from a mine in Utah that does not use cyanide. 
 But the largest sellers of gold are not luxury outlets like his, but rather Wal-Mart stores, and even Mr. Kowalski, a trustee of the Wildlife Conservation Society, hesitated to call any gold entirely ''clean.''

Asia's Insatiable Appetite
 Amrita Raj, a 25-year-old bride, was shopping for her wedding trousseau on a recent Saturday in New Delhi. There was a ''wedding set'' to be bought that day, with its requisite gold necklace, matching earrings and two sets of bangles. 
 For the sake of family honor, the new in-laws would have to receive gold gifts as well -- a ''light set'' for the mother-in-law, plus a gold ring or a watch for the bridegroom, and earrings for a sister-in-law.
 ''Without gold, it's not a wedding -- at least not for Indians,'' Ms. Raj said.
 For thousands of years, gold has lent itself to ceremony and celebration. But now old ways have met new prosperity. The newly moneyed consumers who line the malls of Shanghai and the bazaars of Mumbai sent jewelry sales shooting to a record $38 billion this year, according to the World Gold Council, the industry trade group.
 Over the last year, sales surged 11 percent in China and 47 percent in India, a country of a billion people whose seemingly insatiable appetite for gold -- for jewelry, temples and dowries -- has traditionally made it gold's largest consumer.
 That kind of demand leads many in and out of the industry to argue that gold's value is cultural and should not be questioned. The desire to hoard gold is not limited to households in India or the Middle East, either. 
 The United States, the world's second-largest consumer of gold, is also the world's largest holder of gold reserves. The government has 8,134 tons secured in vaults, about $122 billion worth. The Federal Reserve and other major central banks renewed an agreement last year to severely restrict sales from their reserves, offering, in effect, a price support to gold. 
 That price is not simply a matter of supply and demand, but of market psychology. Gold is bought by anxious investors when the dollar is weak and the economy uncertain. That is a big reason for gold's high price today.
 For miners that price determines virtually everything -- where gold is mined, how much is mined, and how tiny are the flecks worth going after.
 ''You can mine gold ore at a lower grade than any other metal,'' said Mike Wireman, a mine specialist at the Denver office of the E.P.A. ''That means big open pits. But it must also be easy and cheap to be profitable, and that means cyanide.''
 That kind of massive operation can be seen at Yanacocha, a sprawling mine in northern Peru run by Newmont. In a region of pastures and peasants, the rolling green hills have been carved into sandy-colored mesas, looking more like the American West than the Andean highlands.
 Mountains have been systematically blasted, carted off by groaning trucks the size of houses and restacked into ziggurats of chunky ore. These new man-made mountains are lined with irrigation hoses that silently trickle millions of gallons of cyanide solution over the rock for years. The cyanide dissolves the gold so it can be separated and smelted.
 At sites like Yanacocha, one ounce of gold is sprinkled in 30 tons of ore. But to get at that ore, many more tons of earth have to be moved, then left as waste. At some mines in Nevada, 100 tons or more of earth have to be excavated for a single ounce of gold, said Ann Maest, a geochemist who consults on mining issues.
 Mining companies say they are meeting a demand and that this kind of gold mining, called cyanide heap leaching, is as good a use of the land as any, or better.
 Cyanide is not the only option. But it is considered the most cost-effective way to retrieve microscopic bits of ''invisible gold.'' Profit margins are too thin, miners say, and the gold left in the world too scarce to mine it any other way. 
 ''The heap is cheaper,'' said Shannon W. Dunlap, an environmental manager with Placer Dome. ''Our ore wouldn't work without the heap.''
 But much of those masses of disturbed rock, exposed to the rain and air for the first time, are also the source of mining's multibillion-dollar environmental time bomb. Sulfides in that rock will react with oxygen, making sulfuric acid. 
 That acid pollutes and it also frees heavy metals like cadmium, lead and mercury, which are harmful to people and fish even at low concentrations. The chain reaction can go on for centuries.
 Many industry officials, reluctant to utter the word pollution, protest that much of what they leave behind is not waste at all but ground-up rock. The best-run mines reclaim land along the way, they say, ''capping'' the rock piles with soil and using lime to try to forestall acid generation. 
 But stopping pollution forever is difficult. Even rock piles that are capped, in an attempt to keep out air and rain, can release pollutants, particularly in wet climates.
 Cyanide can present long-term problems, too. Most scientists agree that cyanide decomposes in sunlight and is not dangerous if greatly diluted. But a study by the United States Geological Survey in 2000 said that cyanide can convert to other toxic forms and persist, particularly in cold climates.
 And just as cyanide dissolves gold out of the rock, it releases harmful metals, too.
 There have also been significant accidents involving cyanide. From 1985 to 2000, more than a dozen reservoirs containing cyanide-laden mine waste collapsed, the United Nations Environment Program reported. 
 The most severe disaster occurred in Romania in 2000, when mine waste spilled into a tributary of the Danube River, killing more than a thousand tons of fish and issuing a plume of cyanide that reached 1,600 miles to the Black Sea. 
 That spill led to calls for the gold industry to improve its handling of cyanide. After five years of discussion, the industry unveiled a new code this month. It sets standards for transporting and storing cyanide and calls on companies to submit to inspections by a new industry body. 
 But the cyanide code is voluntary and not enforced by government. And Glenn Miller, a professor of environmental science at the University of Nevada, says it does not adequately deal with one of mining's most important, unattended questions: What happens when the mine closes?

A Rocky Mountain Disaster
 One answer can be found in a rural, rugged area of northeastern Montana called the Little Rocky Mountains. 
 There, Dale Ployhar often comes to the high bare slopes around the abandoned Zortman-Landusky gold mine to plant pine seedlings on a silent hillside that has been reclaimed by little more than grasses. 
 ''I bring lodgepole seeds and scatter them around, hoping they'll come back,'' he said, looking out over the tiny town of Zortman, population 50.
 Zortman-Landusky was the first large-scale, open-pit cyanide operation in the United States when it opened in 1979. The imprint it left on the environment, psyche and politics of Montana continues today. 
 What happened there -- a cacophonous, multilayered disaster involving bankruptcy, bad science, environmental havoc and regulatory gaps -- foreshadowed the risky road that gold has taken in the years since, mining experts, government regulators and environmentalists say. 
 ''There's a lot of bitterness left,'' said Mr. Ployhar, 65, a heavy equipment operator, whose son bought some of the mine lands at a bankruptcy auction four years ago.
 Some mining experts say that Zortman-Landusky -- a combination of two open pits near Zortman and the neighboring village of Landusky -- offered a steep learning curve on how chemical mining worked, and didn't. 
 Others say that overly ambitious production schedules by the mine's owner, Pegasus Gold, based in Canada, were to blame. A bonus package of more than $5 million for top executives, announced after the company filed for bankruptcy protection in 1998, did not help. 
 Mining with cyanide can be tricky even in the best conditions. At Zortman, the company made the mistake of building their cyanide heaps atop rock that turned acidic. The cyanide and the acid mixed in a toxic cocktail that seeped from the mounds.
 Mining stopped in 1996, and company officials insisted in their public comments over the next year that they wanted to be responsible corporate citizens and stay to clean up the property. But the price of gold was falling, then below $280 an ounce, and Pegasus closed its doors.
 ''This became one of the worst cases in Montana,'' said Wayne E. Jepson, manager of the Zortman project at the Montana Department of Environmental Quality. ''But even as late as 1990, one of the last studies for Landusky predicted no acid in any significant amounts.''
 Environmental risks from hard-rock mines often turn out to be understated and underreported, according to two recent studies.
 Robert Repetto, an economist at the University of Colorado, examined 10 mines in the United States and abroad run by publicly traded companies. All but one, he wrote in a June report, had failed to fully disclose ''risks and liabilities'' to investors. 
 The environmental group Earthworks examined 22 mines for a report it will publish in November. Almost all of them had water problems, leading it to conclude that ''water quality impacts are almost always underestimated'' before mining begins. 
 ''The combination of the regulatory approach and the science is what creates inaccurate predictions,'' said James R. Kuipers, a consultant and former mining engineer who helped write the study.
 At Zortman-Landusky, the state wrote the environmental impact study itself, based primarily on information from the company, Mr. Kuipers said.
 Montana and other big mining states still often depend on mining companies for much of the scientific data about environmental impact, or the money to pay for the studies, state and federal regulators say, mainly because government agencies generally lack the resources to do expensive, in-depth research themselves.
 Some mine regulators defend the practice, saying that having scientific data supplied by companies with a financial interest in the outcome is not necessarily bad if the review is stringent.
 ''What is important to make the system work is that state and federal agencies have the wherewithal and expertise to look at the information,'' said Mr. Wireman of the Denver E.P.A. office. 
 But one lesson of Zortman is that good information is sometimes ignored.
 In the early 1990's, an E.P.A. consultant and former mining engineer, Orville Kiehn, warned in a memo to his bosses that not enough money was being set aside by the mine for water treatment. 
 Mr. Kiehn's opinion, vindicated today, went nowhere. The environmental agency had little legal authority then -- and no more today -- to protect the public from an operating mine except by filing a lawsuit, as it did in 1995 after Pegasus had already violated federal clean water standards. 
 The company settled the suit in 1996 and agreed to pay $32.3 million mostly to upgrade and expand water treatment.
 At the time, state officials rejected the idea of squeezing Pegasus to put up more money. This spring, Montana's legislature created a special fund for water treatment to make up for it, for the next 120 years, at a cost of more than $19 million.
 Washington is also coming to grips with the failure to plan for the cost of mining. The Government Accountability Office, the investigative arm of Congress, sharply criticized the E.P.A. in August for not requiring metal mines to provide assurances that they can pay for cleanups, a failure that it said had exposed taxpayers to potentially billions of dollars in liabilities. 
 For Montana, the Zortman experience was chilling. In 1998, as the catastrophe was making headlines across the state, voters approved the nation's first statewide ban on cyanide mining, halting any new gold projects. They renewed the ban last year. 

Profit and Poverty
 Today gold companies are striking out to remote corners of the globe led by a powerful guide: the World Bank. 
 The bank, the pre-eminent institution for alleviating world poverty, has argued that multinational mining companies would bring investment, as well as roads, schools and jobs, to countries with little else to offer than their natural resources. For the bank, which tries to draw private investment to underdeveloped lands, the logic was simple. 
 ''We invest to help reduce poverty and help improve people's lives,'' said Rashad-Rudolf Kaldany, head of oil, gas and mining at the bank's profit-making arm, the International Finance Corporation. 
 The bank has worked both ends of the equation. At its urging, more than 100 cash-strapped governments have agreed to cut taxes and royalties to lure big mining companies, said James Otto, an adjunct professor at the University of Denver law school.
 At the same time, the bank put up money for or insured more than 30 gold-mining projects, looking for profits. 
 Though mining was a small part of the bank's portfolio, it was not without controversy as accidents mounted. In one of the worst disasters, in 1995, a mine in Guyana insured by the bank spilled more than 790,000 gallons of cyanide-laced mine waste into a tributary of the Essequibo River, the country's main water source.
 By 2001, the World Bank president, James D. Wolfensohn, imposed a two-year moratorium on mining investments and ordered a review of its involvement in the industry. 
 Emil Salim, a former minister of environment of Indonesia, led the study. ''I said, up to now the International Finance Corporation was only listening to business,'' he said in an interview in Jakarta. ''I said, so now let's give some voice to civil society.''
 Mr. Salim recommended reducing the use of cyanide, banning the disposal of waste in rivers and oceans, and giving communities veto power over mining company plans.
 But the industry complained. And developing country governments said they liked the bank's loans to gold mines. In the end, the bank settled on more modest goals. 
 It pledged to make environmental impact statements understandable to villagers and to back only projects with broad community support. It also urged governments to spend mining companies' taxes and royalties in the communities near the mines. 
 But critics and environmental groups say the bank demands little from the mining companies in return for its money and its seal of approval.
 The bank's guidelines for arsenic in drinking water are less stringent than those of the World Health Organization, and mercury contamination levels are more lenient than those permitted by the E.P.A., said Andrea Durbin, a consultant to nongovernmental groups pressing for tougher standards. 
 The International Finance Corporation is drafting new guidelines that will clarify what it expects from miners, said Rachel Kyte, its director of environment and social development.
 But the draft rules give mining companies even more latitude, said Manish Bapna, the executive director of the Bank Information Center, a group that monitors the bank. They will make it easier for companies to evict indigenous people and to mine in some of the globe's most treasured habitats, he said. 
 Despite the World Bank's two-year review, little has changed, said Robert Goodland, a former director of environment at the bank who was an adviser on the study. ''The bank insists on business as usual,'' he said.

Resistance in Guatemala
 The first piece of new mining business the bank invested in after its review can be found today in the humid, green hills of western Guatemala. 
 Bishop Alvaro Ramazzini, a big burly man who mixes politics and religion with ease, doesn't understand why the World Bank lent $45 million to a rich multinational company for a gold mine in his impoverished region of Mayan farmers. 
 ''Why not spend the money directly to help the people?'' he asked. 
 Sprawled across a deep wooded valley, a new mine built by Glamis Gold, a Canadian company, was chosen by the World Bank last year as a new model for how gold mining could help poor people.
 But the mine has faced protest at every turn. 
 At the June 2004 board meeting of the International Finance Corporation, there was considerable skepticism about its $45 million loan to Glamis. 
 Members questioned why a $261 million project was creating only 160 long-term jobs and giving money to a ''well capitalized'' company like Glamis at all, according to minutes of the meeting provided to The Times by a nongovernmental group opposed to the project.
 Others were worried that the I.F.C. was relying too heavily on information from Glamis about the potential for pollution. 
 The World Bank had pledged to back only mines with broad local support. But on the ground in Guatemala, opposition boiled over last December. 
 Angry farmers set up a roadblock to stop trailers carrying huge grinding machines for the mine. After 40 days, and battles between police and protesters, the equipment had to be escorted by soldiers. 
 To persuade the villagers of the mine's benefits, Glamis flew 19 planeloads of farmers to a mine it runs in Honduras. 
 But the villagers of Sipicapa still wanted their voices heard. On a cool Saturday morning in June, more than 2,600 men and women dressed in their weekend best, with children in tow, crowded into the community's yards, churches and verandas to vote in a nonbinding referendum.
 ''We are already regretting that our forefathers allowed the Spaniards to buy our land for trinkets and mirrors,'' said Fructuoso Lopez Perez, a local mayor. ''So we should vote so our children will thank us for doing right.'' 
 At that, a church full of local people raised their hands in a unanimous show of opposition to the mine. 
 Much of the peasants' fury was informed by Robert E. Moran, an American hydrogeologist, who was asked by Madre Selva, a Guatemalan nongovernmental organization, to visit the mine and review its environmental impact statement. 
 Mr. Moran, who was on the advisory board of the bank's mining study, found it badly lacking. It did not address the ''very large quantities of water'' the mine would use, or give basic information on the ''massive volumes'' of waste the mine would produce, he said.
 Tim Miller, vice president of Central American operations for Glamis, said the environmental impact statement had been a ''working document.''
 In Guatemala City, the Vice Minister of Mining, Jorge Antonio Garcia Chiu, defended approval of the mine, saying it followed four months of consultation.
 Mr. Kaldany, the I.F.C. official, said the investment and the environmental impact statement were both sound. ''We are a bank,'' he said. ''We go on the basis of a business development project. Then, as well, the bank asks: Are we needed? Are we adding any value?'' 
 Glamis had already spent $1.3 million on social programs in the villages as part of the bank's requirements, Mr. Kaldany said.
 At the mine, the grinding and churning of new machinery being tested already echoes across the valley. Production could begin as early as November. 
 Mr. Miller, of Glamis, said the mine was a winner for the people, and his company. In fact, he said, Glamis didn't need the bank, the bank came to Glamis. 
 Bank officials ''were anxious to make some investments'' in the region, he said. The company is expecting to gross $1 billion over the life of the mine, with profits of $200 to $300 million. 
 ''That's a return of about 25 to 30 percent,'' he said.

Ghana: The Social Costs
 The men of Binsre on Ghana's ancient Gold Coast carry on their own hunt for gold. Nearly naked, their arms and legs slathered in gray ooze, they sift through the muck in a large pit, using buckets and hard hats, looking for any last scrap.
 So far industrial mining has not lived up to its promise for these men and their families. They are illegal miners who find work not inside the highly mechanized mines of Ghana's first-world investors, but on the fringes, scavenging the waste left behind by AngloGold Ashanti, the world's second-largest gold company, based in South Africa.
 Six miners have died in the last several years, most of them overcome by fumes when waste from the mine gushed into the pit, said Hannah Owusu-Koranteng, an advocate for the illegal miners. The mine tried to keep the men out. 
 ''We used to use dogs,'' said AngloGold Ashanti's chief financial officer, Kwaku Akosah-Bempah. ''Then they said we were using dogs to bite them.'' So the mine stopped using the dogs and the men returned.
 In the nearby village of Sanso, a few men said they had lost their land to the mine. Now they carve shafts into a mountain of waste rock, where they haul, hammer, chip and sift. 
 ''You wake up one day and you realize your farm is destroyed,'' said Assemblyman Benjamin Annan, a local politician. ''They say they will compensate but it takes one or two years. So people are compelled to go to illegal mining, the way our ancestors did.'' 
 Industrial-size shaft mining has existed in Ghana for 100 years, but with the price of gold soaring, more companies are arriving now, this time bringing open-pit cyanide mines. The investment has been greeted warmly by the government. 
 Newmont is set to spend a billion dollars on a new mine next year and on a second mine -- in one of the badly deforested country's last remaining forest preserves -- in 2007. 
 The World Bank is here, too, preparing to lend the company $75 million. Together, the bank and Newmont say, they aim to show how social development and gold mining can be married. 
 Newmont compensated the farmers who were moved off their land. It is offering training for new jobs, like growing edible snails and making soap. It built new concrete and tin-roofed houses to replace homes made of mud. 
 But the mine will create just 450 full-time jobs. More than 8,000 people will be displaced. 
 ''The house is O.K.,'' said Gyinabu Ali, 35, a divorced mother of five children, who recently moved into her gaily painted two-room house, with a toilet out back, that overlooks several dozen similar units resembling a poor man's Levittown. ''I miss my land where I could grow my own food.'' 
 Near the mine of Newmont's competitor, AngloGold Ashanti, in Obuasi, only half of the homes have an indoor bathroom, and 20 percent have running water. With the exception of the brick villas of the company executives, Obuasi today looks like a vast and squalid shanty town. 
 The chief financial officer, Mr. Akosah-Bempah, said he was offended by the poor conditions. Most of the company's taxes and royalties had stayed in the capital, he said, leaving the ramshackle town bereft of the benefits of gold mining. 
 ''Sometimes we feel embarrassed by going to Obuasi,'' he said. ''Not enough has gone back into the community.''

WASTE ROCK
Rock that does not have enough gold to justify processing goes into waste piles or dumps. Many waste piles, once exposed to air and water, can produce sulfuric acid and other pollutants like arsenic.

TAILINGS
Rock that has been chemically treated for gold extraction. In addition to any residual cyanide or other pollutants they may contain, the piles can be prone to landslides.

Additives used during the refining process can result in the emission of nitrogen oxides, a major cause of acid rain.

(Photographs by Ruth Fremson/The New York Times)(pg. A9)Chart/Diagram: ''Gold Digging''Gold production -- an ounce of gold can require the removal of more than 100 tons of rock -- is rife with environmental hazards. Here is one common approach.1. BLASTINGThe rock is blasted with an explosive, either in an open pit or underground. Open pits can be several thousand feet deep and a mile or more across.2. SEPARATION AND CRUSHINGThe gold-containing ore and waste rock are separated as the material is loaded on trucks or rail cars. Some ore undergoes additional crushing to make it smaller than two inches across.3. STACKINGThe ore is taken to the heap and flattened. Waste rock is placed in dumps or back in the mine as filler.4. HEAP LEACHINGThe heap is soaked with a cyanide solution that seeps through the pile, leaching gold out of the ore. The gold-bearing cyanide solution is collected from a lined leach pad at the bottom of the heap and piped to a lined storage pond.5. CARBON ABSORPTIONAs the gold-bearing cyanide solution flows through a series of tanks the gold is collected onto activated carbon granules. The granules are then filtered out of the cyanide solution, which returns to the heap through a storage pond.6. CARBON STRIPPING AND ELECTROWINNINGGold is removed from the carbon by a hot, concen-trated cyanide and alkali solution, which then passes through a tank with an electrical current that causes the gold to be plated on cathodes.7. DORE PRODUCTIONThe impure deposit on the cathodes is melted into ''gold dore,'' which also contains silver and copper as well as other impurities and may contain from 30 to 95 percent gold.Diagrams highlight the following:Cyanide breaks down in sunlight, but leaks and spills from mines have sometimes flowed into rivers, killing fish, or bonded with other components of the rock, creating new pollutants.

HEADLINE: Republicans Testing Ways to Blunt Leak Charges 

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON and DAVID JOHNSTON

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 23 

 BODY:
With a decision expected this week on possible indictments in the C.I.A. leak case, allies of the White House suggested Sunday that they intended to pursue a strategy of attacking any criminal charges as a disagreement over legal technicalities or the product of an overzealous prosecutor.
 Patrick J. Fitzgerald, the special counsel in the case, is expected to announce by the end of the week whether he will seek indictments against White House officials in a decision that is likely to be a defining moment of President Bush's second term. The case has put many in the White House on edge. [Page A15.] 
Karl Rove, the senior White House adviser, and I. Lewis Libby Jr., who is Vice President Dick Cheney's chief of staff, have been advised that they are in serious legal jeopardy. Other officials could also face charges in connection with the disclosure of the identity of an undercover C.I.A. officer in 2003.
 On Sunday, Republicans appeared to be preparing to blunt the impact of any charges. Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison, Republican of Texas, speaking on the NBC news program ''Meet the Press,'' compared the leak investigation with the case of Martha Stewart and her stock sale, ''where they couldn't find a crime and they indict on something that she said about something that wasn't a crime.''
 Ms. Hutchison said she hoped ''that if there is going to be an indictment that says something happened, that it is an indictment on a crime and not some perjury technicality where they couldn't indict on the crime and so they go to something just to show that their two years of investigation was not a waste of time and taxpayer dollars.''
 President Bush said several weeks ago that Mr. Fitzgerald had handled the case in ''a very dignified way,'' making it more difficult for Republicans to portray him negatively. 
 But allies of the White House have quietly been circulating talking points in recent days among Republicans sympathetic to the administration, seeking to help them make the case that bringing charges like perjury mean the prosecutor does not have a strong case, one Republican with close ties to the White House said Sunday. Other people sympathetic to Mr. Rove and Mr. Libby have said that indicting them would amount to criminalizing politics and that Mr. Fitzgerald did not understand how Washington works. 
 Some Republicans have also been reprising a theme that was often sounded by Democrats during the investigations into President Bill Clinton, that special prosecutors and independent counsels lack accountability and too often pursue cases until they find someone to charge.
 Congressional Republicans have also been signaling that they want to put some distance between their agenda and the White House's potential legal and political woes, seeking to cast the leak case as an inside-the-Beltway phenomenon of little interest to most voters.
 ''I think we just need to stick to our knitting on the topics and the subjects the American people care about,'' Senator Sam Brownback, Republican of Kansas, said on ''Fox News Sunday.''
 The case, which traces back to an effort by the White House to rebut criticism of its use of intelligence to justify the invasion of Iraq, has grown into a crisis for the administration that has the potential to shape the remainder of Mr. Bush's second term. Democrats signaled Sunday that they would use the inquiry to help weave a broader tapestry portraying the Republican Party as corrupt and the White House as dishonest with the American people.
 ''We know that the president wasn't truthful with us when he sent us to Iraq,'' Howard Dean, the chairman of the Democratic National Committee, said on ''This Week'' on ABC. ''What got Rove and Libby in trouble was because they were attacking, which the Republicans always do, attacking somebody who criticized them and disagreed with them. They make the attacks personal. They go over the line.''
 Beyond introducing a Web site for his office last week, Mr. Fitzgerald has given no public hints of what, if any, action he might take. Whatever he decides, he is expected to make an announcement before Friday, the final day of the term of his grand jury. In the past, the grand jury has met on Wednesdays and Fridays. 
 His silence has left much of official Washington and nearly everyone who works at or with the White House in a state of high anxiety. That has been compounded by the widespread belief that there are aspects of the case beyond those directly involving Mr. Rove and Mr. Libby that remain all but unknown outside of Mr. Fitzgerald's office. Among them is the mystery of who first provided the C.I.A. officer's identity to the syndicated columnist Robert D. Novak, who published it on July 14, 2003.
 The negative effects on Mr. Bush's presidency if his senior aides were indicted, said James A. Thurber, director of the Center for Congressional and Presidential Studies at American University in Washington, would be as great as the positive effects of Mr. Bush's handling of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.
 ''This is the most important turning point for his administration in terms of turning down and losing support,'' Mr. Thurber said. 
 A weakened White House, he said, could lead to further infighting among the conservatives who provide most of Mr. Bush's legislative, grass-roots and financial support, and could leave the administration with even less political clout to sway Democrats in Republican-leaning states to back Mr. Bush's agenda.
 Republicans acknowledged the problems facing the White House but said Mr. Bush would ultimately be judged on whether he produced results in addressing the issues of most concern to the American people.
 ''If you look at poll numbers and things like that, we face challenges,'' said Ken Mehlman, chairman of the Republican National Committee. But even in the last few months, he said, the White House has made ''tremendous long-term progress'' on a variety of fronts.
 He cited the referendum on a constitution in Iraq, signs that the economy remains strong and what he characterized as evidence that Mr. Bush's signature education legislation, the No Child Left Behind Act, is producing measurable results.
 Mr. Fitzgerald has been focused on whether there was an illegal effort at the White House to undermine the credibility of Joseph C. Wilson IV, a former ambassador who became a critic of the administration's Iraq policy by his dismissive comments over the possibility that Baghdad had sought to buy uranium fuel from Niger.
 The prosecutor has sought to determine if the effort against Mr. Wilson involved the intentional identification of his wife, Valerie Wilson. Mr. Fitzgerald has tried to find out whether Bush officials violated the law that protects the identities of undercover officers like Ms. Wilson or sought to impede the inquiry by misleading investigators or providing false information about their actions.

 BODY:
IS there celebration in the halls of Citibank this week? Is MBNA uncorking the Champagne while Ford Motor Credit serves cake? Eleven years ago, these and other creditors pushed hard to re-elect sympathetic members of Congress who would enact a tougher bankruptcy law. Last Monday, the law they lobbied for went into effect.
 It was a long fight -- President Bill Clinton vetoed one bill, anti-abortion forces derailed another -- but in the end the credit industry succeeded in making it much harder for struggling families to ease their debt loads. The industry helped fend off efforts to soften the bankruptcy bill's impact on soldiers fighting overseas and on victims of natural disasters. It even turned thumbs down on an amendment to limit enforcement of debts that carried more than 100 percent interest. 
But is the new bankruptcy law now set in stone? Is Congress that rigid, the financial industry that strong?
 In a free-market economy, bankruptcy laws are written and rewritten as new economic problems bubble to the surface. Today, consumers and small businesses that have been swamped by debt are in the crosshairs. Tomorrow, insurance company failures, a collapse of the mortgage-lending market, or another outrageous story of a Wall Street executive who hung onto a fortune while seeking shelter in bankruptcy may excite Congressional attention. 
 Even as the new law goes into effect, there are six new bankruptcy bills pending in Congress, three of them responding to the recent hurricanes. Others are sure to follow: Several members of Congress have railed against the airlines' use of bankruptcy to write off their pension obligations, for example. 
 The first draft of the new bankruptcy law was written in the mid-1990's by lobbyists for the credit industry. As they explain, they then ''shopped'' the bill to friends in Congress who advanced it. ''It is rare to find such clear evidence of the effects of money'' in Washington politics, Howard Rosenthal, a Princeton economist, and co-author Stephen Nunez wrote in 2002 of the progress of the bankruptcy amendments.
 But though the lobbyists, public relations gurus and consumer lenders can change the laws, that won't change the underlying economic reality -- or pay the bills. 
 Academic research shows that about half the families in bankruptcy filings have serious medical problems. Two-thirds of those who file have lost a job or a small business. Twenty percent have just suffered a family breakup -- a husband who disappeared, a wife who died, a family separated by long distances. 
 Many have sustained multiple hits: illness and a layoff, divorce and business failure. Because of the hurricanes, in the next few years, bankruptcies in Louisiana and Mississippi are likely to grow at a rate that is about 50 percent faster than in the rest of the country. 
 And when the crisis passes -- when debtors get back to work or sweep the muck out of their homes -- they will still face a mountain of bills and a ferocious onslaught by collection agencies. If those in such straits can't find a way to get current on their debts quickly, they'll face foreclosure on their homes, repossession of the cars they need to get to work and morning-to-night debt collection calls.
 Punishing debtors this way won't put money in creditors' pockets. Creditors who planned to reap windfalls from this new law may be sorely disappointed as they discover that their lobbyists promised more than they can deliver. And if the bankruptcy system becomes unworkable for both debtors and creditors, pressure will build for change.
 Sometime soon, politicians will realize that those who find themselves in bankruptcy are solidly middle-class people who have been to college, married and bought houses. This year, about 300,000 will be small-business owners who want a chance to try again. Married couples with children will be about twice as likely to file as those with no children, and single parents will be about four times more likely than those with no dependents at home. Families caring for elderly relatives are also at special risk. 
 These are hard-working people who have been laid low by forces far beyond their control. They are the constituents of the politicians who took the credit industry's side over theirs.
 The new bankruptcy laws will surely squeeze some people harder, and they may well improve short-term corporate profits. But those laws won't solve the underlying problems of unemployment, inadequate health insurance or failing small businesses. They won't stop hurricanes or floods. And because those problems aren't going away any time soon, the need to restore common sense to the bankruptcy system will not go away either.
 The industry should enjoy its cake and Champagne today. It won't last forever.

PERSON: Ben Shalom Bernanke

HEADLINE: A Washington Gamble Pays Off for a Professor; Ben Shalom Bernanke

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE and EDUARDO PORTER; Stephen Labaton contributed reporting from Washington for this article and David Leonhardt from New York.

 BODY:
Even before President Bush named Ben S. Bernanke as chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers this spring, Mr. Bernanke decided to gamble. He sold his home in New Jersey last year and told friends that, instead of returning to a tenured professorship at Princeton University, he was taking a chance that President Bush would elevate him from obscurity as a Federal Reserve governor to a top political appointment. 
 The gamble paid off. If the Senate confirms him, Mr. Bernanke will arguably become the most powerful economic leader in the world. Not since Arthur Burns, the Federal Reserve chairman from 1970 to 1978, has a university professor run the nation's central bank. 
 But while Washington policy making may be Mr. Bernanke's newly chosen field, no one seems to have a clear idea what his political views are, other than the fact that he is a registered Republican. Mr. Greenspan took strong political positions, using his pulpit at the Fed to promote Social Security private accounts and to sell the president's tax cuts. Mr. Bernanke, in contrast, has been muted on such political hot potatoes even as the president's chief economic adviser.
 Now, as he moves to the Fed, he is likely to steer the central bank away from the broader political debate. ''One can expect Bernanke to adhere strictly to a more silent stance regarding issues outside of monetary policy,'' said Kevin A. Hassett, director of Economic Policy Studies at the American Enterprise Institute.
 Mr. Bernanke, 51, is more like a ''Mr. Smith Goes to Washington'' than the political figure that Mr. Greenspan already was when he became Fed chairman in 1987. Appointed a Fed governor in August 2002, Mr. Bernanke from the start considered his term in Washington as a time-out from academia. 
 But Washington grew on him. His friend, Gene M. Grossman, another Princeton economist, said that Mr. Bernanke ''thought it would be informative and interesting to actually work on policy.''
 ''And then he found he was enjoying it and he was good at it,'' he said.
 Hooked as he was, Mr. Bernanke nevertheless bridled at Washington's customs, including its dress code. ''The biggest downside of my current job is that I have to wear a suit to work,'' he told fellow economists in a speech last January. He likes tan socks and was once chided by President Bush for wearing them with a dark suit. His puckish response was to buy a dozen tan socks and distribute them at the next White House gathering.
 Less than three years into the Fed job, Mr. Bernanke's name went to the top of the list of candidates for the chairmanship of the Council of Economic Advisers. By then he had sold his home for $630,000 in Montgomery Township, N.J., where he had served for a while as president of the board of education, and purchased a house in Washington, paying $839,000 for it.
 As a professor he wrote dozens of papers on economics and was the co-author with Robert H. Frank of Cornell University of an economics textbook for beginners. At the Fed, his heavily footnoted speeches had a scholarly twist. He is credited with coining the term ''savings glut'' to help explain the huge American trade deficit that is largely financed by the savings of foreigners.
 A diffident, unassuming man, he nevertheless is often playful. He regularly wrote songs and skits for Christmas gatherings of faculty and students, and sometimes performed in them. While Mr. Bernanke was working on a textbook with Mr. Frank in the late 1990's, a competitor, N. Gregory Mankiw, a Harvard professor and Mr. Bernanke's predecessor at the council, published his own textbook. 
 Mr. Mankiw, in his book, made a point about the value of time, and posed the hypothetical question: Should the basketball superstar Michael Jordan mow his own lawn? The Mankiw textbook was a best seller and made him a considerable amount of money. According to Mr. Frank, Mr. Bernanke insisted that their book ask the question: Should N. Gregory Mankiw mow his own lawn? 
 Mr. Frank, a liberal professor at Cornell, and Mr. Bernanke were an odd couple as authors of ''Principles of Economics,'' published in 2001. While Mr. Frank wears his politics on his sleeve, Mr. Bernanke does not.
 ''When the news first came that he was a candidate to be named a Fed governor, I thought it was interesting that the Bush administration would nominate a Democrat,'' Mr. Frank said. ''I was surprised. I worked with him and did not know he was a Republican.''
 As chairman of the Princeton economics department for six years, Mr. Bernanke gained a reputation as a good manager of a diverse group of academics with healthy egos. His style in handling them was self-deprecating. He described himself as ''primus inter pares'' or first among equals. ''We're all the same rank,'' he told The Daily Princetonian, the campus newspaper. ''I'm just the one sitting in the chair.''
 As chairman of the Fed, he will be more than first among equals. The Fed chairman is the final arbiter of monetary policy, but more than Mr. Greenspan, Mr. Bernanke is likely to seek consensus on Fed policy. ''He was a good listener at Princeton,'' Mr. Grossman said. ''He never felt that he had an agenda.'' 
 Ben Shalom Bernanke was born on Dec. 13, 1953, in Augusta, Ga., the son of a pharmacist and a schoolteacher. He grew up in Dillon, N.C., and earned his bachelor's degree at Harvard, graduating summa cum laude in 1975. Four years later, he received a doctorate in economics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. 
 As a student and professional economist, he focused on the Depression, arguing in effect that the central bank helped to bring on the deflation of that era by raising interest rates too much. In 2002, as a Fed governor, that became a special concern when inflation seemed to be moving toward zero. In his speeches, he spoke out about this risk.
 ''When inflation is already low and the fundamentals of the economy suddenly deteriorate, the central bank should act more pre-emptively and more aggressively than usual in cutting rates,'' he said in a speech in November 2002.
 Mr. Bernanke taught at Stanford from 1979 until 1985, and then moved to Princeton where he remained until his Fed appointment, having come to the attention of the Bush administration as one of the nation's top monetary economists.
 He and his wife, Anna, a Spanish teacher, have two college-age children: a daughter, Alyssa, and a son, Joel. 
 Like Mr. Greenspan, he is a baseball fan, and an enthusiast about sports, sometimes disputing the methods used in the major leagues in calculating player statistics. ''He's got a very sharp mind for things that don't add up,'' said Dwight M. Jaffee, a former Princeton economist and squash partner. 
 Mr. Bernanke reported last year on a financial disclosure form that he had $1.1 million to $5.6 million in assets like retirement accounts, mutual funds and government bonds. By comparison, Mr. Greenspan, reported that his assets were $4.3 million to $9.4 million.

HEADLINE: Step Right Up, the Fares Are Down

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER ELLIOTT

 BODY:
Forced to book a last-minute airline ticket from New York to Denver recently, Beth Zimmerman braced for the inevitable sticker shock. Walk-up fares bought by business travelers typically cost hundreds, even thousands of dollars more than tickets purchased in advance.
 Instead, Ms. Zimmerman, a marketing strategist from Long Beach, N.Y., got a pleasant surprise: A round-trip ticket on Frontier Airlines cost $275, about $75 more than the discount tickets. ''I was stunned,'' she said. ''I really thought I was going to have to pay through the nose to get to Denver.'' 
 With fuel prices soaring and the holiday season approaching, leisure travelers are starting to grumble about higher fares. But business travelers, far from feeling the pain, are enjoying one of the longest periods of generally falling prices in recent memory.
 The average one-way business fare has fallen 36 percent over the last three years, to $431 last month from $676 in September 2002, according to Harrell Associates, a New York company that analyzes air fares. And the decline has accelerated each year, with prices dropping by an average $34 in 2003, $75 in 2004 and $137 this year.
 The fares are still much higher than leisure fares that are reserved ahead of time, but the gap has narrowed sharply, from a 6-to-1 differential a year ago to 4-to-1 today, according to Bob Harrell, the analysis firm's founder. ''Business travelers used to pay outrageously more for their tickets,'' he said. ''Now, they're only paying more.''
 Bargain-hunting business travelers can often do even better with a little legwork. Ms. Zimmerman, who manages her own travel, says she now considers the price of an airline ticket ''almost inconsequential'' and worries more about hotel and rental car expenses. ''It's a buyer's market for airline tickets,'' she said.
 The fares that big corporations negotiate with airlines, generally in the autumn for the following year, are also shrinking, if not quite so rapidly. In the second quarter of this year, the average price of a negotiated one-way ticket fell 7 percent from a year earlier, to $218, according to the American Express Business Travel Monitor. That compares with $259 five years ago.
 Business travelers can thank no-frills airlines like AirTran Airways, JetBlue Airways and Southwest Airlines for the savings, even if they are flying on a network carrier. ''The major airlines have adjusted their pricing to better compete with the low-cost carriers,'' said Thomas S. Wilson, a spokesman for American Express Business Travel.
 Here is the bad news: The sustained drop in business fares probably cannot last. Prices will most likely rise in the short term. Runzheimer International, a management consulting firm in Rochester, Wis., predicts companies will spend 12 percent more on airfares in 2006. Phyllis Schumann, a Runzheimer analyst, says business fares have ''hit bottom.''
 Then again, she hastens to add, she could be wrong. At the very least, the price gyrations in the weeks and months ahead could be uneven. ''In some markets, air fares are going to go up,'' she said. ''In other markets, they won't. It depends how much competition there is from a low-cost airline, and how willing they are to raise fares.''
 And, of course, events could overtake the industry and put downward pressure on prices yet again. ''Maybe there will be a flu outbreak,'' Ms. Schumann said. ''Maybe there will be another catastrophe. Right now, it's reasonable to assume that fares will go up, but not necessarily that they will stay there.''
 Business travelers are already experiencing some of this uncertainty when they go shopping for cheap tickets. Consider Richard Laermer's recent experiences booking transcontinental flights. Mr. Laermer, who owns a public relations agency in Manhattan, flies regularly to and from Palm Springs, Calif., where he owns a home.
 ''The fares have been nutty,'' he said. For years, flights from Palm Springs to New York were priced ''reasonably,'' he says -- from $250 to $350. Then, after Delta Air Lines filed for bankruptcy, American Airlines raised its prices for that route. The last time he checked, American was charging about $800 for a round-trip economy-class flight to Kennedy Airport. The same flight on Delta cost $700 -- in first class. Mr. Laermer said he believed that American was taking advantage of worries about the future of Delta.
 ''I had to call American Airlines to make sure it wasn't some kind of typographical error,'' he said. It wasn't.
 Travelers can avoid higher fares by selecting an alternate airport. For example, Mr. Laermer can drive an extra 45 miles to Ontario International Airport or 120 miles to Los Angeles International Airport and save hundreds of dollars on a ticket. 
 If the current buyer's market for business fares turns into a seller's market next year -- and barring natural disasters, terrorist attacks or a flu pandemic, it probably will -- then what happens? Will corporate travelers simply pay more for these expensive tickets? Probably not, a recent survey of business travelers by Accenture suggests. Half of those questioned in the poll said they were now making their travel arrangements more than 14 days in advance, up from 46 percent eight months ago.
 In other words, business travelers are behaving like leisure travelers to qualify for a better price. That puts the airlines, particularly the ailing network airlines, in a tight spot. ''Profits are elusive,'' said Michael Allen, the chief operating officer of Back Aviation Solutions, a consulting firm. ''Airlines either need to raise fares, or the price of oil has to come down.'' 
 If the network airlines increase prices, they are probably going to have to do it across the board. Before their low-cost rivals came along, they could get away with passing along most of the rising costs to business travelers. But those days are gone. ''There's more price sensitivity among business travelers than ever,'' Mr. Allen said.

HEADLINE: In Europe, Big Boats for 'Middle-Tier Millionaires' and Hang the Fuel Expense 

BYLINE: By JOHN TAGLIABUE

DATELINE: GENOA, Italy 

 BODY:
What do you do after you have purchased your 100-foot mega-yacht? You shop around for one or two 25-foot inflatable boats as tenders.
 The annual boating trade fair opened here on Oct. 8 and closed on Oct. 16, the largest in a series of big boat shows that stretch from Cannes, France, to Monaco to Fort Lauderdale, Fla.
This year, big is beautiful, and everyone seemed to be promising even bigger next year. 
 And that brings relief to Europeans, for they closely watch boating fairs like Genoa's to judge the overall health of their economy. In the boom years of the 1990's, prosperity attracted customers who might never before have thought of themselves as yacht owners. 
 But the stock market reversal and, above all, the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, slowed the industry. Now with striking new models and bigger, more fully equipped boats, the industry is trying to lure customers back to the water, and the signs are that they are coming.
 At BWA Nautica, the big Italian maker of inflatable boats, one star of the show was its 28-foot inflatable craft. With two outboards to drive it, the boat sells for $105,000. Next year, the company will have its 39-foot model ready. How do you inflate it?
 ''With an electric air pump, in 15 minutes,'' said Marco Paradiso, BWA's director of sales. He added: ''Don't try to use your foot.''
 Across the harbor of this Mediterranean port, representatives of the big Finnish Nautor Swan yards were showing their custom 75-foot sailing yacht, which can be had for $4.7 million, with fine wood finishing outside and in, and chock-full of the latest electronic equipment.
 ''The owner is in finance,'' said Paola Ciribilli, a company official, ''so he wants to work on board night or day. So there's a satellite link for video and Internet.''
 Larry Ebbs, operations manager for International Yacht Collection, brokers and builders of yachts in Fort Lauderdale, said: ''In general, mega-yachts, in the 80- to 100-foot range, have been pretty robust the past couple of years. There's a kind of 'my boat's bigger than your boat' syndrome out there. The market's quite healthy.''
 Are boats tending to get bigger? ''The answer is yes,'' he said. Of course, the builders of what have come to be called giga-yachts -- even bigger boats of 400 feet to 500 feet -- prefer the Monaco boat show, which just preceded Genoa. Still, the best-known builders below that category were all here.
 The high price of oil, which yachts burn as fuel, did not seem to worry anyone. Fulvio Dodich, chief executive of Ferretti Yachts, a unit of the Ferretti Group of Italy, described his customers as ''middle-tier millionaires,'' adding that 17 percent of them had liquid financial assets of more than $100 million. ''Fuel consumption is not that important,'' he said.
 But the health of the American market affects how European boat builders fare. Ferretti, Italy's biggest yacht builder, does about 20 percent of its business in the United States.
 European yacht builders have made their deepest mark in the American market for sailboats, but they are running to catch up with powerboats as well.
 To do so, yacht builders from Italy, France, Germany and elsewhere have increasingly transformed the business into a high-end branch of the luxury goods arena by creating yachts that are to sailing what Ferraris or Porsches are to driving.
 ''Last year and this year, the market has been improving,'' said Bruce Qvale, president of Chris-Craft Europe, which unveiled its 36-foot Corsair, already available in the United States and soon to be on the market in Europe for $488,000. He said buyers of giga-yachts also bought modest boats like the Corsair. ''They're easier to get around in,'' he said.
 The Genoa show features tiny runabouts and immense yachts like the 110-foot Revitality, sold by the Baglietto yards of Italy for about $12 million. There are cute boats and ominous Darth Vader craft all in black.
 European governments have recently made efforts to revive the marine market, in part to offset the loss of shipbuilding jobs in coastal regions. Italy and France have introduced tax changes so that customers who lease rather than buy craft bigger than 32 feet do not pay the value-added tax.
 That translates into a saving of 10 percent to 20 percent. Hence, leasing has boomed, and banks and leasing companies were out in force.
 ''For the last three years, the marine market has been growing; it's no longer in crisis,'' said Franco Frigerio, a banker with Banca Italease, a division of Banca Popolare Italiana. And thanks to Europe's common market, individual customers and charter companies from other parts of Europe are flocking to Italy and France to shop.
 ''It's a real boom,'' said Mr. Frigerio. Now marine leasing accounts for 7 percent of his bank's $14 billion loan portfolio, he said.
 Still, with so many boats on the market, competition is fierce among boat builders, and some have began casting about to build boats more cheaply in Eastern Europe or Asia.
 Quicksilver and Arvor, units of the Brunswick Corporation, have begun designing and building boats in Poland; the Delphia unit of the Italian boat builder Comar is now selling about 80 to 90 boats a year that are built as well at yards in northern Poland.
 ''Building costs are 30 percent less, even though you have the same standards,'' said Flaminia Palazzo, Comar's export sales director. With wages in Poland 8 to 10 times less than in Western Europe, ''it's a fantastic product to compete against other European yards,'' she said. The company had the idea because most of the workers at its yards in Italy are now Poles.
 Still, few industry executives see a quick rush to move manufacturing capacity into Asia or Eastern Europe. Small craft like those manufactured by Quicksilver and Comar may benefit from the region's low wages.
 ''Can a luxury item be manufactured in China or Poland or the Czech Republic?'' asked Mr. Dodich of Ferretti. ''We don't think so. You're guaranteed design, Italian style, a good feel, comfort, because you're buying a real Italian luxury product.''
 Yet, he added, Eastern Europe, including Russia, and Asia, including China, remain vast undeveloped markets for Western European boat builders. Above all, he said, China remains the Big Rock Candy Mountain.
 ''It's a huge market that's important for the marine business,'' he said, adding that he visited China in 1996 and that Ferretti now had dealers in Qingdao and Shanghai. But he said lack of infrastructure, like marinas and boating facilities, hampered growth.
 ''They are starting only now building new infrastructure, the same as in the Mediterranean,'' Mr. Dodich said. ''It's a market to look at with seriousness.''

HEADLINE: Lincoln as the Visionary With His Eye on the Prize

BYLINE: By MICHIKO KAKUTANI

 BODY:

Team of Rivals
The Political Genius of Abraham Lincoln
By Doris Kearns Goodwin
Illustrated. 916 pages. Simon & Schuster. $35.
 More words have been written about him than about any other American. In fact, more words have been written about him, it's been estimated, than about any other figure in the history of the world with the exception of Jesus.
He's been hailed as the Great Emancipator, the Savior of the Union and the folksy embodiment of the Common Man. He's also been assailed as a white supremacist, a calculating egotist and an unstable manic-depressive. He's been deified and psychoanalyzed, deconstructed and mythologized, venerated and defenestrated. Entire books have been devoted to every aspect of his life, from his political philosophy and moral vision to his deprived youth and tumultuous marriage, from his views on race and liberty to his views on tobacco and joke-telling. There have even been books about the other books about Abraham Lincoln.
 All of which poses a problem for the historian bent on writing a new biography of Lincoln: how to find a fresh approach to the great man, how to avoid simply regurgitating familiar facts and shopworn theories.
 In an appealing but awkward new book, ''Team of Rivals,'' Doris Kearns Goodwin tries to look at Lincoln through his relationships with his former political rivals turned cabinet members: Sen. William H. Seward of New York (who became Lincoln's secretary of state), Gov. Salmon P. Chase of Ohio (who became secretary of the treasury), and Missouri's elder statesman, Edward Bates (who became attorney general). The result is a book that gives us a portrait of Lincoln as a virtuosic politician and managerial genius -- a sort of visionary C.E.O. whose magnanimity, wisdom, humor and shrewd political instincts helped him to hold together a contentious cabinet and even more contentious coalition of Republicans, moderate Democrats and border-state Unionists, and thereby wage a successful war to preserve the Union and emancipate the slaves.
 ''His political genius,'' Ms. Goodwin writes, ''was not simply his ability to gather the best men of the country around him, but to impress upon them his own purpose, perception and resolution at every juncture.'' It has become somewhat fashionable of late to try to debunk or at least de-idealize Lincoln. Michael Lind's book ''What Lincoln Believed,'' published this year, is only the latest volume to assail the 16th president as a racist and segregationist. Douglas L. Wilson's 1998 book ''Honor's Voice'' depicted the young Lincoln as an expedient pol with a mean streak in dealing with rivals. And David Herbert Donald's 1995 biography emphasized what he called the ''essential passivity'' of Lincoln's nature.
 Ms. Goodwin's book, in contrast, belongs to the hagiographic tradition. Her Lincoln may not be the ''plaster saint'' -- an ''amalgam of John Wesley and the Holy Ghost'' -- that H.L. Mencken decried, but she skims lightly over her subject's more pragmatic political maneuverings and his troubling utterances about race (like his advocacy of sending blacks to a colony abroad or his assertion during his famous debates with Stephen Douglas that he had ''no purpose to introduce political and social equality between the white and the black races''). Indeed, Ms. Goodwin's Lincoln often resembles Carl Sandburg's man of ''steel and velvet,'' a wise and strong leader for the ages, whose legacy, in Ms. Goodwin's words, belongs ''not only to America but to the ages -- to be revered and sung throughout all time.'' 
 She praises his ''unseen hand'' as a ''veteran statesman'' in preventing Britain and France from intervening in the Civil War (something often credited to Secretary of State Seward). She writes that he ''inspired an almost mystical devotion among his troops'' and notes that ''his lifelong tendency to consider all sides of a troubled situation'' enabled him to urge ''a more sympathetic understanding of the nation's alienated citizens in the South'' in hopes of healing the wounds of war.
 Of course Lincoln is such an iconic and written-about figure that Ms. Goodwin's portrait is highly familiar in many respects -- from our schoolbook primers, from the writings of William Herndon (Lincoln's former law partner, who interviewed many of the 16th president's friends and acquaintances in what has been described as one of the first oral history projects in American history), from the plethora of Lincoln biographies that have appeared over the years.
 Once again we are given a portrait of Lincoln as a self-educated prodigy, blessed with an instinctive literary gift nourished by his readings of Shakespeare and the King James Bible; Lincoln as a melancholic, who seemed ''to absorb the horrors of the war into himself''; Lincoln as an entrancing storyteller, who used his impish sense of humor and love of anecdotes to charm colleagues, defuse controversies and persuade opponents.
 Like so many earlier writers, Ms. Goodwin emphasizes Lincoln's continuing ability to learn and grow. The gawky young man, worried that there was little he could accomplish as a politician coming of age in the daunting shadow of the founding fathers, would preside over what many have called ''the Second American Revolution.'' The callow lawyer with little political experience would topple and eventually win the respect and devotion of those rivals who mocked his provincialism and rough edges. 
 As for the more alarming statements Lincoln made about slavery, Ms. Goodwin argues that on this pivotal subject, too, the president gained in understanding and insight as the years went by, and she suggests that he moved forward on emancipation as he intuited the readiness of the Union to embrace this principle without creating further dissent and divisions.
 For readers expecting a straightforward biography, Ms. Goodwin's decision to focus the book on the president's relationships with rivals-turned-colleagues makes for a somewhat vexing start. The first quarter of the volume cuts back and forth between Lincoln's life and the lives of Seward, Chase and Bates, delineating these men's stories in far more detail than any but the most devoted student of this period's partisan politics could possibly want to know. At the same time, Ms. Goodwin demonstrates a peculiar reluctance to stand back and give the reader a wide-angled view of the period: as a result, matters like the political, cultural and economic issues that underlay the Civil War are passed over in a perfunctory manner, as are the larger strategic imperatives of the North's military campaign.
 Still, Ms. Goodwin's narrative abilities, demonstrated in her earlier books, are on full display here, and she does an enthralling job of dramatizing such crucial moments in Lincoln's life as his nomination as the Republican Party's presidential candidate, his delivery of the Gettysburg address, his shepherding of the 13th Amendment (abolishing slavery) through Congress, and his assassination, days after General Lee's surrender. She shows how Lincoln's friendships with Seward and his secretary of war, Edwin M. Stanton, indelibly shaped his presidency, and how his masterly ability to balance factions within his own administration helped him to keep radicals and moderates, abolitionists and northern Democrats behind the Union cause.
 After so many recent books focusing on narrow personal aspects of Lincoln's life (his moods, his sexuality, his marital difficulties), after so many books dwelling on negative aspects of his philosophy and politics, it isrefreshing to be reminded of the myriad challenges he faced in waging the Civil War and holding the Union together, and his palpable if incomplete achievements in helping to reinvent the nation and set it on a more just course.

HEADLINE: Stakes High for M.T.A. and City In Vote on $2.9 Billion Bond Act

BYLINE: By SEWELL CHAN

 BODY:
Its name, the Renew and Rebuild New York Transportation Bond Act of 2005, hardly arouses excitement. Many voters are only dimly aware of it. It is not an issue in the mayoral race, since both major candidates have endorsed it. But the success or failure of the $2.9 billion proposition on Election Day could have a profound effect on the New York City region for decades. 
 The stakes are especially high for the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which would get half the money. The authority considers the measure essential to maintaining and improving its transit network over the next five years, and has recently saturated subway cars with advertisements urging support. Approval on Nov. 8, the authority says, would permit the completion of the first leg of a Second Avenue subway by around 2015.
The other half of the money would pay for 130 projects for roads, bridges, inland ports and railroad systems. 
 The bond act, Proposition 2, has drawn a remarkable unanimity of support from business, labor, environmental and planning organizations. Gov. George E. Pataki and State Comptroller Alan G. Hevesi support it, as do Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg and his Democratic opponent, Fernando Ferrer. 
 Even so, passage by the state's 11.7 million registered voters is far from assured. A similar $3.8 billion measure narrowly failed in November 2000, when upstate voters overwhelmingly rejected it, outweighing the support of city voters. 
 Supporters said new state borrowing is critical for future economic growth. ''The availability and reliability of mass transit continue to be major factors in business-location decisions, driving demand for commercial real estate and dictating patterns in job growth,'' said Kathryn S. Wylde, president of the Partnership for New York City, the city's most prominent business group.
 Mr. Pataki, in a speech on Oct. 14, linked the bond act to the struggle against terrorism, arguing that the transportation investments could save drivers 17 million gallons of fuel a year.
 ''Reducing oil consumption is critical to New York's ability to compete in the global marketplace, but make no mistake about it, it is also critical to the security of our nation,'' he said in the speech.
 Opponents say Proposition 2 is fiscally reckless because it would add to the state's $47.6 billion debt burden.
 ''Voters should reject the transportation bond act so that the already dangerous debt situation is not immediately made that much worse,'' said Charles M. Brecher, research director of the Citizens Budget Commission, a nonpartisan watchdog group. 
 Among the 50 states, New York has consistently been ranked fourth or fifth for net tax-supported debt as a percentage of personal income, and only California has a worse credit rating, according to the New York City Independent Budget Office. The budget office has not taken a position on the bond act.
 ''The question,'' said Preston Niblack, a deputy director of the budget office, ''is whether the economic returns from transportation investments are enough to outweigh the costs to the state's economy and budget of the additional debt burden.''
 Over all, projects in New York City would directly receive about 43 percent of the proceeds from Proposition 2 -- roughly equivalent to the city's regular contribution to the state treasury.
 Practically every transit agency survives on subsidies. Fares and tolls -- which were raised in 2003 and again this year -- cover about half of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority's operating expenses, a larger proportion than in most transit systems in the United States. Having the state, rather than the authority, assume new debt lessens the relative burden shouldered by riders. Debt service consumes 13 percent of the authority's operating budget and is projected to rise to 20 percent by 2008. 
 ''There is no responsible alternative to approving the bond act,'' said Beverly L. Dolinsky, executive director of the Permanent Citizens Advisory Committee, a panel that advises the authority. ''Issuing bonds that expand the M.T.A.'s debt load is a fare-hike bomb with a time-delay fuse.'' 
 The opponents see in the bond act a lack of fiscal discipline by the state. The chairman of the state's Conservative Party, Michael R. Long, said the state ''simply cannot afford'' new debt. If interest rates rise and the repayment period is lengthened, he said, the true cost of the bond could rise to $4.6 billion over 20 to 30 years. 
 Proposition 2 arose from an April agreement between Mr. Pataki and the Legislature to finance five-year capital programs for the authority and for the State Department of Transportation. The State Constitution generally requires new long-term debt to be submitted to voters for approval. 
 Elliot G. Sander, director of the Rudin Center for Transportation Policy and Management at New York University and a central organizer of the coalition supporting the bond act, said the alternative to new borrowing -- significantly raising taxes and motor-vehicle fees -- is ''dead on arrival in Albany.''
 Rejecting the measure, he said, ''is nothing short of playing high stakes Russian roulette with New York's future.'' 
 The outcome of the vote could well rest not on the arguments, but on turnout in New York City, which may be higher as a proportion of statewide turnout this year, because of the mayoral race, than it was in 2000, a presidential election year.
 A Quinnipiac University poll released this month showed that state voters supported the act over all, by 56 percent to 36 percent. The measure was strongly favored by city and suburban voters, but upstate voters opposed the bond act by a slight margin, according to the poll, of 1,219 registered voters. 
 Public awareness, or the lack of it, also could be crucial. The coalition -- of business, labor and environmental groups -- announced yesterday a $1.5 million campaign to promote the bond act. The sum includes $400,000 on advertisements and a Web site (www.voteyesny.org). The opponents have done little outreach, limiting themselves to statements at public hearings.
 The authority says it had learned much from the failure of the measure five years ago. 
 ''Few voters knew what it was, what was in it and what the consequences were of its passage or rejection,'' said Christopher P. Boylan, a deputy executive director of the authority. ''We in government collectively did a poor job of educating the public about what the act would mean to them.''
 On its Web site, the transportation authority has emphasized core investments covered by the bond act, including $117 million to replace tracks, $115 million to buy subway and commuter-railroad cars, and $90 million for new buses. 
 But in subway and bus advertisements, the authority also has emphasized three major expansion projects for which the bond act is critical: a Second Avenue subway; a new connection between the Long Island Rail Road and Grand Central Terminal; and plans for a rail link between Lower Manhattan and Kennedy International Airport.
 The three projects would be the first significant expansion of the authority's transportation network since the completion of the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge in 1964. But they might also seem like dreamy abstractions; a Second Avenue subway has been under discussion since the Depression. 
 Riders frustrated by fare increases, service disruptions and terrorism threats also may not feel kindly toward the authority, which still plans to raise fares and tolls in 2007. A plan by the authority's chairman, Peter S. Kalikow, to offer fare discounts and free tickets to riders during the holiday season could be seen as an attempt to buy good will in advance of the Nov. 8 vote.

HEADLINE: Home Depot Pays a Disabled Ex-Worker 

BYLINE: By PAUL VITELLO

 BODY:
In a settlement that could have wide implications within a small but growing community of severely disabled workers, Home Depot Inc. has agreed to pay $75,000 to a mentally disabled former employee whose supervisor fired her without first consulting the employee's job coach.
 Home Depot also agreed to maintain closer contact in the future with disabled workers' job coaches, in a consent decree signed earlier this month with the Equal Opportunity Employment Commission.
The commission had accused the retail giant in a federal lawsuit of violating the Americans With Disabilities Act of 1990 by failing to notify the woman's coach of disciplinary problems. It said that measure should have been taken under the ''reasonable accommodations'' provision of the law. 
 ''This decree is significant because it sends a message to those who employ the disabled that mental disabilities have to be accommodated just as well as physical disabilities,'' said Sunu Chandy, the commission lawyer who handled the case for the New York district office. 
 She said the decree was among the first in the nation to address the rights of workers with job coaches. ''If a disabled person has trouble understanding something, the job schedule, for instance, that difficulty is part of their disability and must be accommodated,'' she said. 
 Job coaches are not a new phenomenon, but they are increasingly employed by nonprofit agencies seeking to help disabled people, especially those with mental retardation or severe physical disability, find jobs outside the cloistered world of sheltered workshops.
 The coach's services as a trainer and monitor of the disabled employee are paid for by the agency, usually with public dollars, and not by the worker's employer.
 About 120,000 people nationwide have such job coaches. Some coaches work side by side with the assisted worker. Some just help to train the person, then visit once or twice a week, as did the coach who helped the plaintiff in this case, Carolyn Pisani, now 30, when she got her job as a sales associate at the Home Depot store in South Setauket, on Long Island, in 1999.
 Ms. Pisani, who graduated from high school despite an I.Q. said in court records to be 60, was fired after being accused of missing two scheduled days of work. 
 Though she did not deny missing the two days, both Ms. Pisani and her father, Joseph Pisani, said in depositions that a person claiming to be a Home Depot supervisor called the evenings before both days, saying she would not be needed the next day. 
 The Pisanis did not question the caller. Like many large retailers, Home Depot frequently adjusts workers' schedules on short notice. Home Depot said no authorized person made those calls, and people familiar with the case say they may have been pranks.
 When Ms. Pisani arrived for her next scheduled workday, she was met by a supervisor, who demanded that she sign a number of bad-performance reports for unexcused absences and then fired her. She had worked at Home Depot for four months.
 Ms. Pisani's job coach, who was employed through a State Education Department program known as Vocational and Educational Services for Individuals with Disabilities, was only informed after the fact, even though the coach had helped train Ms. Pisani and was making weekly visits to see that she was meeting all her supervisors' expectations.
 ''She was devastated,'' said Susan Slavin, a private lawyer from Long Island who represented Ms. Pisani until the commission took over the case in 2003. ''This job meant a great deal to her.'' 
 Ms. Pisani lived at home, as she still does, but the job meant she earned enough for her own car payments and spending money. ''She had pride in her work,'' Ms. Slavin said. ''You don't know what this means to a person like her.''
 In a statement, a Home Depot spokesman said, ''The Home Depot denies that it engaged in any form of workplace discrimination, but entered into the settlement with the E.E.O.C. in order to avoid costly and protracted litigation.''
 In the past, those who help place mentally disabled people in jobs sought opportunities mainly in sheltered workshops, where all the workers are disabled.
 But, reflecting a general trend in the accommodation of people with physical and mental limitations, ''there has been a complete switch in favor of more integration during the last 5 to 10 years,'' said Dr. Rebecca Cort, deputy commissioner of the New York State Education Department.
 Last year alone, her department placed 13,000 disabled workers in jobs in which a coach was involved to a greater or lesser degree, she said. She said she did not have figures on the total number of such accommodations in the state.
 ''It is increasingly the strategy of choice,'' said William E. Kiernan, director of the Institute for Community Inclusion at the University of Massachusetts in Boston, a nonprofit agency advocating for the disabled.
 How employers of the disabled would react to the Home Depot consent decree was the source of some concern among advocates, Mr. Kiernan said, adding, ''Some employers will undoubtedly say, 'Oh my God, I have to have control over the firing process,' but in general the advantages for them outweigh any disadvantages.''
 Besides being paid with public dollars, a job coach usually trains and acts as a second-tier supervisor for the developmentally disabled employee, who can turn out to be more reliable and less likely to leave for another job than the average worker, especially in low-paying jobs, Mr. Kiernan said.
 In Ms. Pisani's case, a coach helped her learn her job as a sales associate in the electrical department, helping familiarize her with five contiguous aisles of merchandise that included electrical tools, conduits, phone and TV accessories, wall lights and light bulbs. ''She had good job performance reports all along, until the very end,'' Ms. Slavin said.
 Under the federal disabilities act, employers cannot deny any disabled person a job that he or she is able to perform with a ''reasonable accommodation'' on the employer's part, according to Bob Silverstein, director of the Center for the Study and Advancement of Disability Policy and one of the act's authors as the former staff director of the Senate subcommittee on disability policy.
 ''This decree is important because the unemployment rate among disabled people is very great, and this will ensure that more will keep the jobs they get,'' he said. After being fired, Ms. Pisani found several other jobs in which she was accommodated with a job coach, her former lawyer said. She has since married, and lives in Suffolk County with her husband, her parents and her 2-year-old child.

HEADLINE: The Lap of Luxury

BYLINE: By Elisabeth Eaves. 
Elisabeth Eaves is the author of ''Bare: The Naked Truth About Stripping.''

DATELINE: PARIS 

 BODY:
IT'S happened again. Another innocent man who just wanted a few lap dances claims to have been victimized by an exclusive New York strip club, Scores. 
 This time it's an executive from Missouri named Robert McCormick, who, treating himself and friends, ran up a $241,000 bill at Scores on his corporate American Express card two years ago. American Express is now suing him for refusing to pay up. Several other unhappy customers have also sued Scores over large bills. 
These don't seem to be cases of bill padding. American Express sought signed receipts from the club before bringing its suit against Mr. McCormick. In the most recent suit against Scores, meanwhile, the plaintiff's justification is simply that he was drunk when he signed his bills.
 Nevertheless, the Manhattan district attorney's office is investigating allegations of overcharging at Scores. To which I say, as someone who has worked in strip clubs, you've got to be kidding -- there's no such thing as ''overcharging'' in this industry.
 Does Christian Dior ''overcharge'' when it sells a handbag for $13,000? That depends on how you look at it. If you see the handbag as a few pieces of stitched leather, the price is grossly inflated. If you see it as a source of heady self-worth -- a passport to an exclusive club -- then it's hard to say what price would be too high.
 This is the economic logic relied on by purveyors of luxury goods. It's not about the utility of the product. It's about making the customer feel as if he has arrived.
 Strip clubs, particularly high-end ones like Scores, provide a luxury service. That $3,000 price tag on a bottle of Champagne isn't just for the beverage; it's part of the price of the experience. Mr. McCormick probably didn't go to Scores strictly to see topless women, or even for the physical contact and potential sexual gratification of a lap dance. Both experiences can be had in simpler, cheaper ways.
 Rather, he and his colleagues probably went because being surrounded by fawning, semi-naked, Champagne-flute-wielding women was for them a symbol of success. It's like hiring a chauffeured limousine: a taxi would get you there, but without the aesthetic experience.
 When I worked in a Seattle peep show, I had a customer who told me his name was Excalibur and quietly slipped me his poetry. Part of my job, in that moment, was to make him feel like a Knight of the Round Table. This required only a show of curiosity and respect. He must have found those things hard to come by in the real world, though, because he paid me well to help spin the illusion. 
 With many customers, fawning is key. What a stripper sells is not her ability to dance or take off her clothes, but her ability to suspend the customer's disbelief. 
 If she is doing her job right, his bald spot and his mortgage cease to exist, and he enters an adolescent fantasy of sexual prowess, temporarily transformed into James Bond, Han Solo and Hugh Hefner all rolled into one. The dancers keep cooing and flattering until the money runs out. It's not duplicitous; it's what the patron signs up for. 
 I have little sympathy for these carping customers. Their complaints are the height of boorishness. It's acceptable to indulge your James Bond fantasies, but it's not acceptable, when the bill comes due, to remain convinced that you're James Bond. The dancers weren't in it for kicks.
 Among strippers I worked with, the most dreaded customers were not the obese or the lame. Rather, we feared customers who thought they were exceptions to the rule. They were just handsome enough, or successful enough, to foolishly think that their own sex appeal was tip enough.
 It's just this kind of guy who would backpedal on a strip club bill and go crying to the courts that he was hustled. Well, sure, the dancers hustled Mr. McCormick, but no more so than the occasional Mercedes dealer. Buyer's remorse is not an occasion to stiff the seller.
 So, gentlemen, pay the bill. A reasonably priced lap dance is not a right.

HEADLINE: Study Finds Small Developing Lands Hit Hardest by 'Brain Drain'

BYLINE: By CELIA W. DUGGER

 BODY:
Poor countries across Africa, Central America and the Caribbean are losing sometimes staggering portions of their college-educated workers to wealthy democracies, according to a World Bank study released yesterday. 
 The study's findings document a troubling pattern of ''brain drain,'' the flight of skilled middle-class workers who could help lift their countries out of poverty, some analysts say. And while the exact effects are still little understood, there is a growing sense among economists that such migration plays a crucial role in a country's development.
The findings are based on an extensive survey of census and other data from the 30 countries in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, which includes most of the world's richest nations. 
 The study found that from a quarter to almost half of the collegeeducated citizens of poor countries like Ghana, Mozambique, Kenya, Uganda and El Salvador lived abroad in an O.E.C.D. country -- a fraction that rises to more than 80 percent for Haiti and Jamaica. 
 In contrast, less than 5 percent of the skilled citizens of the powerhouses of the developing world, like India, China, Indonesia and Brazil, live abroad in an O.E.C.D. country. 
 These patterns suggest that an extensive flight of educated people is damaging many small to medium-size poor countries, while the largest developing countries are better able to weather relatively smaller losses of talent, and even benefit from them when their skilled workers return or invest in their native lands, said Frederic Docquier, a lead researcher for the bank and an economist at the University of Leuven in Belgium.
 ''For a country with a third of its graduates missing, one has to worry,'' said Alan Winters, director of the World Bank's development research group.
 The World Bank study, published yesterdayin a book, ''International Migration, Remittances and the Brain Drain,'' also presents an analysis of the effect of the money that migrants from Guatemala, Mexico and the Philippines sent home, typically to their families. 
 Those payments, known as remittances, helped reduce poverty in those countries and were a major source of foreign exchange, but the broader implications were complex. 
 In Guatemala, for example, rural families receiving the money spent more on education and less on consumption. But in Mexico, children in migrant families actually got less education than those of nonmigrants, possibly because their families believed that they would eventually migrate to the United States for unskilled jobs that did not reward higher levels of learning.
 Some of the bank's data on brain drain have brought debate. Mark Rosenzweig, a Yale University economist, argues that the bank's measurement is inflated because it does not exclude immigrants who moved to a rich country as children, or who got their college educations there.
 Survey data on immigrants from Jamaica, for example, show that almost 4 of 10 came to the United States before the age of 20, he said. 
 Bank researchers say they are now gathering such information, though it is not available for many countries, and acknowledge that it would be useful to know where migrants were educated. But they and some experts outside the bank say its latest report still offers the most comprehensive sense yet of the magnitude of the brain drain from poor countries, though that knowledge is admittedly rough and incomplete.
 Most experts agree that the exodus of skilled workers from poor countries is a symptom of deep economic, social and political problems in their homelands and can prove particularly crippling in much needed professions in health care and education.
 Jagdish Bhagwati, an economist at Columbia University who migrated from India in the late 1960's, said immigrants were often voting with their feet when they departed from countries that were badly run and economically dysfunctional. They get their government's attention by the act of leaving.
 ''If you stay you don't have any bargaining power at all,'' he said. 
 But some scholars are asking whether the brain drain may also fuel a vicious downward cycle of underdevelopment -- and cost poor countries the feisty people with the spark and the ability to resist corruption and incompetent governance.
 Devesh Kapur and John McHale argue in their book, ''Give Us Your Best and Brightest,'' published last week by the Center for Global Development, a research group in Washington, that the loss of institution builders -- hospital managers, university department heads and political reformers, among others -- can help trap countries in poverty.
 ''It's not just the loss of professionals,'' said Mr. Kapur, an associate professor of government at the University of Texas at Austin. ''It's also the loss of a middle class.''
 The question of what can be done to lessen the damage is vexing and gets into difficult questions of whether to limit the migration of skilled workers. The immigration policies of rich nations, including the United States, Canada, Britain and Australia, have sought to attract highly educated professionals, to bolster their competitiveness and to fill gaps in domestic skills.
 Many experts say they oppose efforts to curtail the movement of migrants, but they are debating possible ways to help poor countries cope. An idea that Professor Bhagwati first proposed in the 1970's -- that developing countries should tax their expatriate workers -- is getting a fresh look.
 Editors of the World Bank's book say policies may be needed to raise the incomes of professionals in their home countries. 
 Others, including Professor Kapur and Professor McHale, who is an economist at the business school of Queen's University in Kingston, Ontario, suggest that new ways be found to compensate the hardest-hit countries for their losses. They also say rich countries should consider setting up time-limited visas that would allow professionals to work for a few years before taking their expertise, and savings, back home.
 Professor Kapur likened a skilled immigrant's getting a visa to work in a rich country to winning a lottery, because the income gains from moving are so great. Whatever the approach, he said, the benefits to the few who are lucky enough to leave need to be weighed against the costs to their countrymen left behind.

HEADLINE: Envoy in Mideast Peace Effort Says Israel Is Keeping Too Tight a Lid on Palestinians in Gaza 

BYLINE: By GREG MYRE

DATELINE: JERUSALEM, Oct. 24 

 BODY:
James D. Wolfensohn, the special envoy for nations active in Middle East peacemaking, has criticized Israel for failing to ease restrictions on Palestinian movement into and out of the Gaza Strip, where residents currently face greater difficulties in traveling than before Israel's withdrawal.
 ''The government of Israel, with its important security concerns, is loath to relinquish control, almost acting as though there has been no withdrawal,'' Mr. Wolfensohn wrote in a letter dated Oct. 17 and released to news organizations on Monday.
The letter was addressed to the United Nations secretary general, Kofi Annan, and to the United States, the European Union and Russia. 
 In the West Bank, Israeli troops shot dead two wanted Palestinians in a gun battle on Sunday night. 
 One was Luay al-Saadi, a senior leader of Islamic Jihad, who Israel said was responsible for two suicide bombings and a shooting earlier this year that killed a total of 11 Israelis.
 The confrontation widened on Monday evening when Islamic Jihad fired several rockets from northern Gaza into southern Israel, calling the action an ''initial response.'' 
 Later, Israeli aircraft fired missiles and ground forces fired artillery shells at suspected Palestinian rocket-launching sites in northern Gaza. No injuries or damage were reported in those exchanges. 
 The developments pointed to the fading of hopes that the Gaza withdrawal, completed on Sept. 12, would improve the atmosphere between the sides.
 In his letter, Mr. Wolfensohn also said the Palestinian Authority was plagued by ''internal fragmentation,'' which was harming its own cause. 
 ''The current combination of violence and turmoil is undermining the stability needed to induce private investors to bring their capital to the Palestinian economy,'' he added.
 Mr. Wolfensohn noted that a few development projects in Gaza had begun, including repairs to the main north-south road inside Gaza, and construction on new housing and classrooms.
 ''Time is short, and optimism is a fragile commodity,'' he wrote. If the parties involved ''miss this opportunity for change, we will regret it for the next decade.''
 Israel maintained a web of travel restrictions on Palestinians in Gaza before it withdrew. 
 In the six weeks since, it has been even more difficult for Gaza residents to travel in any direction to Israel, to the West Bank or on to Egypt and the wider world.
 ''Palestinians were hoping that the withdrawal would lead to improvements in their movements, but things have been deteriorating,'' said Ghassan Khatib, the Palestinian planning minister.
 The Rafah crossing point between southern Gaza and Egypt, the scene of chaos immediately after the Israeli pullout, has been closed for most of the past six weeks. 
 Israel has proposed an alternative crossing nearby, which it would control, but it is not yet in operation.
 Before the Israeli withdrawal, about 6,500 Palestinians passed daily through the Erez crossing at the northern end of Gaza into Israel, mostly for work, according to Mr. Wolfensohn. The daily figure is now 100 or fewer, he said. 
 There also has been a significant drop in the number of trucks crossing at Karni, where commercial goods enter and leave Gaza on its eastern border.
 Mark Regev, a spokesman for the Foreign Ministry, said Israel ''understands that the Palestinian economy has to grow in Gaza, but this has to be balanced with a need for security.''
 He said progress had been delayed by the turmoil on the Gaza-Egypt border and a recent Palestinian shooting attack in the West Bank that killed three young Israelis. 
 ''The Palestinians must also do more to help us, and that means they have to act against their extremists,'' Mr. Regev said.
 Both Israeli and Palestinian officials said they hoped to resume talks within a week on Palestinian movement along Gaza's borders.
 The shootout that killed Mr. Saadi, 26, came during a nighttime incursion by Israeli troops into Tulkarm. The Israeli military described him as the top Islamic Jihad leader in the northern West Bank, which has been the launching pad for the group's deadliest attacks in recent months.
 The Israeli military said soldiers approached a house in Tulkarm with the intent of arresting ''senior wanted Islamic Jihad terrorists,'' though the forces were not aware that Mr. Saadi was among them.
 The soldiers came under fire and shot dead one wanted Islamic Jihad member, Majed Askar, the military said. 
 The troops then spotted a second gunman fleeing the house and shot him dead. Only afterward did the military learn it was Mr. Saadi, said a senior Israeli military officer, on the customary condition of anonymity.
 The Israeli officer said Mr. Saadi had been in Israeli custody but was freed last year.
 The Palestinian leader, Mahmoud Abbas, condemned the Israeli raid, while Khaled al-Batsh, a top Islamic Jihad leader in Gaza, said the group ''will never keep silent, and the response will be harsh and tough.''
 Prime Minister Ariel Sharon said in February that Israel would refrain from incursions in Palestinian areas unless it faced the threat of attack. The military says actual and planned attacks have been on the rise, and it has carried out almost daily raids in the West Bank recently. 
 More than 20 Palestinians were detained in the West Bank overnight, the Israeli military and Palestinian officials said.

HEADLINE: France and U.S. to Press U.N. to Demand Syrian Cooperation

BYLINE: By WARREN HOGEand STEVEN R. WEISMAN; Warren Hoge reported from the United Nations for this article, and Steven R. Weisman from Washington. Joel Brinkley contributed reporting from Ottawa.

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Oct. 24 

 BODY:
The United States and France said Monday that they would push for Security Council action to demand that Syria end its obstruction of the United Nations investigation into the assassination of the former Lebanese prime minister, Rafik Hariri.
 ''This is true confessions time now for the government of Syria,'' said John R. Bolton, the United States ambassador. ''No more obstruction, no more half measures. We want substantive cooperation and we want it immediately.'' 
Jean-Marc de la Sabliere, the ambassador of France, said, ''There is a lack of cooperation of the Syrians.''
 ''We want to have the whole truth,'' he added, and the Council will have to use its authority to find it.
 Detlev Mehlis, the German prosecutor in charge of the investigation, is to present his report formally to the Security Council on Tuesday. The strongly worded 54-page document, made public on Thursday, implicated high-ranking members of the Syrian government in the killing on Feb. 14 of Mr. Hariri, who had incurred Syria's wrath by protesting its dominance of Lebanese politics.
 The report also accused Syria of not cooperating with Mr. Mehlis and of giving him misleading information. It was that aspect of the report that the United States and France addressed Monday in deciding what action they would ask the Council to take.
 Sean McCormack, a State Department spokesman, said the United States was seeking a high-level Security Council meeting on Syria on Monday with the 15 member states represented by their foreign ministers.
 Diplomats at the United Nations and in Washington said any proposed resolution probably would not seek to impose sanctions on Syria, but would implicitly threaten them if President Bashar al-Assad is unwilling to provide more information about the Hariri case and access to individuals implicated in the case.
 Diplomats involved in the process said pushing for sanctions now could jeopardize the goal of gaining approval of a tough resolution by all 15 Security Council members. China and Russia are traditionally reluctant to approve United Nations sanctions, and Algeria, which represents Arab countries on the Council, is also expected to resist imposing them.
 A senior State Department official said the United States favored the strongest possible measure but added, in reference to those three countries, ''There's a lot of ground to cover between now and the time of the resolution.''
 Alexander V. Konuzin, the deputy Russian ambassador, said his delegation had seen no proposed language and was eager to. ''We have asked our American partners, 'Where is it? Is it still in Washington?''' he said.
 Asked if Russia would favor a resolution under Chapter VII of the United Nations charter, which calls for forceful measures like economic and diplomatic sanctions, or one under Chapter VI, which calls for solutions through negotiation and mediation, he said: ''We don't have yet instructions, so I can't say six or seven. I can't.''
 China's ambassador, Wang Guangya, said he saw no need for the more forceful measures.
 Mr. Bolton said he ''sensed a real unity of purpose on the Council'' in seeking Syria's cooperation with Mr. Mehlis, whose investigation has been extended to Dec. 15.
 Asked if the United States would push for sanctions, he said, ''We haven't made any decision yet on the specifics, but I think it should be a very strong resolution, leaving no ambiguity that we expect Syrian cooperation and we expect it now.'' He added, ''How best to do that and show broad support for that is what we're still working out in active consultations today.''
 Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and Foreign Secretary Jack Straw of Britain both conferred by telephone over the weekend with French diplomats and others while they traveled together in Alabama, officials traveling with them said.
 Ms. Rice, speaking to reporters on her plane on Monday on her way to Canada, would not say what the resolution would include, but did say, ''The important thing is to send a very strong message to the Syrians that their noncooperation cannot continue.'' Asked whether Syrian officials should be tried for war crimes, she said, ''We are not at the point yet of deciding what kind of tribunal is needed.''
 The strategy appeared to be to let France take the lead, because of its influence in the region and because some Arab countries have faith in France not to try to widen the anti-Syrian diplomatic campaign to embrace other issues, such as Palestinian attacks in Israel and the United States' charge that Syria is infiltrating insurgents across its border into Iraq.
 American officials say they want the Security Council to address that issue, though, and to condemn any support Syria has given to insurgents in Iraq. Secretary Rice and other administration officials have stepped up their criticisms, charging that insurgents are supplied from inside Syria and that supporters of the insurgency fly in and out of the Damascus airport unimpeded. 
 European diplomats in Washington said French officials were counseling the administration that moving too aggressively on that issue risked losing the international support for stern action that the Mehlis report has produced.
 Among the possibilities under discussion for punishing continued noncooperation by Damascus, diplomats said, would be a travel ban on Syrians suspected of involvement in the Hariri case or a freeze of their overseas assets.
 Mr. Bolton said: ''There is a pretty clear determination that Syria has to cooperate actively with the Mehlis commission and that the seriousness of the conclusions that Mehlis has been able to come to have affected people here. They recognize that the obstructionism that Syria has been practicing is the principal reason why Mehlis can't make his report final.''

HEADLINE: Drug Suspect In Afghan Ring Is Sent to U.S.

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. McFADDEN; Colin Moynihan contributed reporting for this article.

 BODY:
An Afghan identified as one of the world's most wanted drug kingpins, who has been linked to the Taliban and once boasted that selling heroin to Americans was a form of jihad, has been extradited from Afghanistan to face drug smuggling and other charges, federal officials in New York announced yesterday.
 The suspect, Baz Mohammad, 47, was accused of leading an organization that smuggled heroin worth $25 million into this country in a 15-year operation that controlled poppy fields in Afghanistan, heroin refining plants there and in Pakistan, and a trafficking network that reached around the world to the streets of New York, Washington, Chicago and other American cities.
Mr. Mohammad was also accused of using drug profits to support terrorism and the Taliban, the Islamic fundamentalist party that ruled Afghanistan for years and was allied with Al Qaeda and Osama bin Laden. While the Taliban was ousted by American troops in 2001, it has remained a force in large areas of Afghanistan, especially along the eastern border with Pakistan, and the drug money bought its protection for poppy crops, heroin laboratories, shipments and conspirators, the federal officials said. 
 Afghanistan is the source of 87 percent of the world's poppies and heroin, and officials said the prosecution of Mr. Mohammad -- officially designated by President Bush in June as a drug lord who represented a threat to American security and the economy -- had struck a blow against heroin traffic in this country and the flow of drug money to the Taliban in Afghanistan. 
 ''This is a tremendous step forward for this government,'' said Michael J. Garcia, the United States attorney for the Southern District of New York, at a news conference with American and Afghan officials after a 13-page indictment of Mr. Mohammad was unsealed in federal court in Manhattan.
 ''Afghanistan will no longer be a safe haven for narco-traffickers like Baz Mohammad,'' Mr. Garcia said. 
 Karen P. Tandy, administrator of the United States Drug Enforcement Administration, and Maj. Gen. Sayed Kamal Sadaat, director general of Afghanistan's narcotics police force, also attended the news conference and hailed the indictment. 
 Ms. Tandy called Mr. Mohammad ''one of the world's most wanted, most powerful and most dangerous drug kingpins,'' adding, ''We've made history today.'' 
 The indictment of Mr. Mohammad, also known as Haji Baz Mohammad, and a co-defendant, Bashir Ahmad Rahmany, described as the leader of the group's drug distribution network, traced the origins of what it called a drug conspiracy to 1990, when it said Mr. Mohammad met with others at his home in Karachi, Pakistan.
 ''During the meeting, Baz Mohammad told his co-conspirators that selling heroin in the United States was a 'jihad' because they were taking the Americans' money and the heroin was killing them,'' the indictment said. Jihad in the Islamic world means holy war. 
 The indictment said that Mr. Mohammad owned vast poppy fields in Nangarhar Province of Afghanistan, and sent harvested opium to laboratories there and in Pakistan to be refined into heroin. The heroin, it said, was sewn into the lining of clothing and shipped in boxes, or smuggled in suitcases to airports in New York, Washington and Chicago.
 Some of the heroin -- with a street value of $1.4 million -- was intercepted by United States officials. But most of it was sold on the streets of American cities, the indictment said. Millions of dollars in drug profits were laundered and sent to Mr. Mohammed in Afghanistan, where the Taliban was paid for protection, the indictment said.
 A raid by Afghan authorities last year added to a growing volume of evidence in the case, federal officials said. It turned up a large cache of heroin and chemicals used in heroin production, along with ledgers that detailed drug transactions and sales of AK-47 machine guns, pistols, rocket launchers, explosive shells and other weaponry. 
 Mr. Mohammad, who was named in a sealed federal indictment in December 2003, was seized in Kandahar, Afghanistan, in January, by American and Afghan authorities. Months of secret extradition proceedings ensued, and Mr. Mohammad arrived in New York in the custody of American officials on Friday, Mr. Garcia said. 
 Arraigned late yesterday before Judge Denny Chin of United States District Court, Mr. Mohammad pleaded not guilty and was held for a hearing on Nov. 14. 
 If found guilty, he would be subject to a prison term of 10 years to life, officials said. They said Mr. Rahmany, who was arrested in New York City in July, remains in custody awaiting trial on related conspiracy charges.

HEADLINE: Lost in the Woods

BYLINE: By Lawrence Herman and Gary Hufbauer. 
Lawrence Herman is a lawyer in Toronto. Gary Hufbauer is a senior fellow with the Institute for International Economics in Washington.

 BODY:
AS Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice continues her talks in Ottawa today, she may find that the most acrimonious disagreement between Canada and the United States is not a question of hard power -- issues like Afghanistan, Iraq and nuclear nonproliferation -- but of softwood. A quarter-century-old dispute over Canadian lumber exports, which Washington claims are unfairly subsidized, has escalated to the point where it now threatens broader relations between the two countries. 
 If it remains unresolved, the softwood war might also spill over into the December ministerial meeting of the World Trade Organization, where Washington and Ottawa have long worked together to expand free trade. What kind of example does it set for the rest of the world if the United States and Canada -- close neighbors, each other's largest trading partner and crucial allies -- cannot resolve their own trade disputes? 
American and Canadian lawyers, lobbyists and negotiators have been fighting on and off over Canadian lumber exports to the United States since the 1980's. In 1982, a coalition of 250 American lumber mills claimed that Canadian provinces were subsidizing lumber exports by charging set ''stumpage fees'' -- the price forest companies paid when harvesting standing timber -- while American mills were paying open market prices. While the fight over things like stumpage fees is complex enough, it got a sharp twist in 2000 when Congress passed an amendment giving American companies injured by foreign trade the punitive duties imposed by the United States, which in the case of Canadian lumber exports now amount to about $5 billion.
 Never mind that the right of the United States to impose such duties is in dispute, or that the W.T.O. declared the Byrd amendment (named after its creator, Senator Robert C. Byrd) illegal. American and Canadian officials now face two lumber disputes: the old one about timber management practices; and the new one about who owns the money held by the Treasury. Making things uglier are conflicting decisions by a panel convened under the North American Free Trade Agreement and by the W.T.O., with the United States claiming that favorable rulings by the latter trump adverse rulings by the former. 
 Canadians, including the normally friendly Canadian business community, are particularly outraged that Washington has rejected the Nafta panel decision. In Canadian eyes, this refusal by the United States betrays the central deal that underpinned Nafta in the first place: Canada allowed unfettered access to its energy resources and an end to restrictions on American investment in return for a binding method of settling disputes. As Prime Minister Paul Martin made clear recently, the dispute is coloring everything from the oil and gas trade (Canada is the largest foreign supplier of energy to the United States) to cooperation in the World Trade Organization, the International Monetary Fund and World Bank.
 If Canada and the United States cannot bring their common heritage and collective ingenuity to resolve the lumber dispute, little hope remains for commercial differences in other areas, or in other parts of the world. With this in mind, we have two suggestions, one to dispose of the $5 billion pot held by the American Treasury, the other to bridge the ancient battle over lumber exports. 
 First, the $5 billion. We recommend that a bilateral trust should administer the funds for the benefit of the North American industry as a whole. Representatives of Canadian and American lumber companies, and the two governments, would manage the trust. Possible projects: scientific research, pest control, forest fire control and re-structuring assistance, especially for smaller mills.
 Second, we believe that President Bush and Prime Minister Martin should each appoint a special envoy with the authority to negotiate a final and durable compromise by a date certain, say June 2006. The idea is to elevate the issue to the highest level, removing it from the present negotiating framework where vested interests exercise far too much influence. We have in mind envoys of the stature of James Baker from the United States and Derek Burney from Canada, who brokered the original Canada-United States free trade deal in the 1980's.
 These envoys would be charged with specific instructions: agree on limits on the Canadian share of the American lumber market that would gradually expand over time; settle the terms for market-based adjustments to the Canadian stumpage system while making provisions for the environment; and hammer out the details for managing the $5 billion pot. As part of the package, all legal actions would be halted.
 The two heads of government should commit in advance to backing whatever agreement their envoys reach within these overall terms. The grand bargain that was Nafta would be returned to pride of place in our relations. Not only would this restore confidence in the strength of the North American partnership, it would strengthen both countries' efforts to promote free trade worldwide.

HEADLINE: If the Mayor Wants to Help

 BODY:
Mayor Michael Bloomberg has made it clear that he wants more say over what happens with the former World Trade Center site. Anybody who yearns for a speedy revival of Lower Manhattan should applaud the mayor's re-entry into this difficult arena. But we should also make certain New York's mayor stays involved in one of the most important and emotionally fraught urban renewal projects in the nation's history. 
 Four years after the attack at ground zero, the rebuilding is progressing in fits and starts. And Gov. George Pataki, who holds many of the levers of power, seems to be losing the political will needed to continue dealing fairly with all of the complicated interests involved. So we welcome Mayor Bloomberg to the fray and have some ideas about how he can help.
First, the mayor should breathe life into the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation, the quasi-private entity set up to run the planning and rebuilding of the site. Governor Pataki gave the corporation's hard-working and prestigious board a swift kick in the stomach last month when he caved in to a group of victims' relatives and squashed the long-planned International Freedom Center at the site. Already the governor's action has resulted in the resignation of Roland Betts, a key member of the corporation's board. But other board members are said to be angry and demoralized. Mr. Bloomberg, who gets to choose eight members of the board, has four vacancies to fill. This would be an ideal time for the mayor to pick energetic and powerful new members, like the head of Goldman Sachs or the president of Pace University downtown. 
 Mr. Bloomberg has also let it be known that he would like for the city to buy out or find some other way to get free of Larry Silverstein, the developer who held the lease of the trade center when it was attacked on Sept. 11, 2001. While Mr. Silverstein might not be the ideal developer for this site, moving him at this stage might only further slow an already slow process of rebuilding.
 Mr. Bloomberg's main complaint about Mr. Silverstein seems to be the push to restore the same square footage of commercial space that was once housed in the twin towers -- about 10 million square feet. The mayor is pitching more apartments for the booming residential market downtown. As slowly as the rebuilding is going, Mr. Bloomberg should have enough time to argue for a readjustment of the square footage in future buildings to more residential than commercial space.
 It would be easy to criticize the mayor for being tardy here, especially since he wasted so much energy promoting the stadium on Manhattan's West Side. But now he has turned to a problem in his city that not only deserves his attention, but also needs a strong and thoughtful leader to go forward.

HEADLINE: Echoes of 1987

BYLINE: By DAVID LEONHARDT; Vikas Bajaj and Eduardo Porter contributed reporting for this article.

 BODY:
With the stock market falling and companies laying off workers, the Federal Reserve under Alan Greenspan was racing to prevent a recession in the early months of 2001. Again and again, the Fed cut its benchmark short-term interest rate to encourage families and businesses to borrow, and spend, money. 
 But to an economics professor in Princeton, N.J., named Ben S. Bernanke, the pace of the rate reductions was a bit rash.
 ''I personally would have preferred if the Fed had been a little less aggressive,'' Mr. Bernanke said in an interview posted on Princeton University's Web site in August that year. Consumer spending and house prices were still rising, the government had mailed out tax rebates, many companies outside the technology sector were doing fine, and a recession looked unlikely, he added. 
 ''I think there's a good chance we'll dodge the bullet this time,'' Mr. Bernanke said.
 In truth, the bullet had already struck. A recession had started in March 2001, economic data later made clear. The downturn was brief -- ending in November, despite the Sept. 11 attacks -- largely because of Mr. Greenspan's aggressiveness, economists say.
 The American economy is now approaching one of its most uncertain periods since then, and the man likely to be sitting in Mr. Greenspan's big leather chair inside the Fed's magisterial decision-making room is his former critic. President Bush yesterday nominated Mr. Bernanke, a senior White House adviser who was a Fed governor from 2002 until this past June, to succeed Mr. Greenspan as chairman early next year.
 Mr. Bernanke's first task is likely to be one that temporarily tripped up Mr. Greenspan shortly after he became chairman in 1987: bringing down inflation without causing too much damage to the economy or the stock market along the way. 
 Over the last year, inflation has reached 4.7 percent, the highest level since 1991, as energy prices have soared. Core inflation, which excludes food and energy and is closely watched at the Fed, has hit 2 percent, the upper limit of what Mr. Bernanke has called his ''comfort zone.''
 Airfares, haircuts, nursery school tuition, new cars, appliances and cigarettes have all become more expensive in recent months. The price of Tide liquid detergent has risen 3.4 percent over the last year, according to the market research firm Information Resources Inc., after years in which inflation on household items was all but nonexistent.
 Mr. Greenspan also arrived at the Fed at a time when inflation fears were growing. His early rate increases contributed to both the Black Monday stock market crash of 1987 and the recession of 1990-91. They also helped to cement the Fed's credibility and to push inflation down to its lowest level in decades. To keep that credibility, Mr. Bernanke may need to lift rates at the same time that the housing market is cooling and $50 gas-tank charges are crimping consumer spending.
 ''Bernanke comes in at a difficult juncture,'' said Laurence H. Meyer, a former Fed governor who is now an economic forecaster. 
 ''So far it's been an easy roll, with interest rates rising at a steady, gradual pace,'' Mr. Meyer added. But as interest rates reach the point that they could choke off economic growth ''there's less of an idea of what the next move should be.''
 Mr. Bernanke, a well-respected researcher who has spent almost his entire career in academia, has developed a reputation as a somewhat less vigilant inflation-fighter than Mr. Greenspan. Testifying before Congress last Thursday as chairman of the Council of Economic Advisors, Mr. Bernanke said that he expected inflation ''to return to levels consistent with price stability in coming quarters.'' 
 But it is not clear that he will be any less aggressive in his early months than Mr. Greenspan would have been. Mr. Bernanke's 2001 criticism of the Fed -- wrong as it turned out to be -- was if anything a warning about the dangers of setting off inflation by cutting rates too deeply. 
 In brief remarks in the Oval Office yesterday, Mr. Bernanke said, ''My first priority will be to maintain continuity with the policies and policy strategies established during the Greenspan years.''
 Investors seemed to believe him. The odds that the benchmark short-term rate would hit 4.5 percent by April, up from 3.75 percent today, reached 94 percent yesterday, according to a futures contract tied to Fed policy. At the start of the day, the odds had been 82 percent.
 ''Ben has been very clear that controlling inflation is the primary long-term goal of the Fed,'' said Frederic Mishkin, a Columbia University professor and a frequent research partner of Mr. Bernanke's. ''And he has the credibility to do that.''
 Alice M. Rivlin, a former Fed governor, added: ''I wouldn't expect him to do anything different than Mr. Greenspan. Certainly not at the beginning.''
 Mr. Bernanke's first months on the job are likely to be occupied by the question of whether energy price increases are seeping into the rest of the economy. So far, the answer seems to be a qualified no. 
 Core inflation is higher than it has been for much of the last few years, but it has come down slightly in recent months, the same period that hurricanes have knocked out oil refineries and sent gasoline to $3 a gallon. 
 One reason seems to be the weak negotiating position of American workers, said Stephen G. Cecchetti, an economist at Brandeis University and an old friend of Mr. Bernanke's. Union membership has shriveled, computers have replaced many jobs and, rationally or not, many workers fear that their jobs will be sent overseas.
 That has complicated life for many families, but it has also helped prevent the sort of inflationary spiral that rocked the economy -- and the Fed -- in the 1970's.
 If energy prices and broad inflation both do fall next year, the housing market and the federal budget deficit could be the next items confronting Mr. Bernanke. 
 Although some economists argue that real estate has become a bubble in coastal markets, he has made clear that, like Mr. Greenspan, he does not think the Fed should try to identify or deflate bubbles. 
 In a speech after joining the Fed in 2002, Mr. Bernanke took a poke at Robert J. Shiller, a Yale economist who is perhaps the nation's most prominent bubble worrier, for saying that stocks were wildly overvalued as early as 1997. Stocks had already risen above their 1997 levels in 2002 and are even higher today.
 Had the Fed tried to bring down stocks in 1997, Mr. Bernanke said, it ''might have done much more harm than good.''
 He is unlikely, though, to be able to avoid questions about the budget deficit. Mr. Greenspan helped pave the way for those deficits by encouraging Congress and the Bush administration to cut taxes. 
 Economists who know Mr. Bernanke have suggested that he plans to avoid injecting himself into policy debates as Mr. Greenspan often did. But reducing the deficit will probably be one of the main issues of the next few years, with the potential to affect everything from the value of the dollar to long-term interest rates to Mr. Bernanke's own reputation.
 ''While deficits can go for an extended period of time,'' said Dwight M. Jaffee, a onetime squash partner of Mr. Bernanke's who is now an economist at the University of California, Berkeley, ''they can't go on forever.''

HEADLINE: Choice of Fed Chairman Helps a Rally on Wall Street

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News

 BODY:
Stocks had their broadest advance in more than a year yesterday after earnings at American Express beat estimates and President Bush named his chief economist, Ben S. Bernanke, the next Federal Reserve chairman.
 ''It's a bit of a relief that earnings have been coming along pretty nicely, and the Fed announcement wasn't unexpected,'' said Richard Sichel, the chief investment officer of Philadelphia Trust. ''That's a great excuse to rally.''
Takeover prospects also helped bolster the market. Computer Sciences climbed after a report that buyout firms might submit a joint bid. Albertson's gained after two groups of private equity firms and Kroger made offers. 
 The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index added 19.79, or 1.7 percent, to 1,199.38. The Dow Jones industrial average increased 169.78, or 1.7 percent, to 10,385. For both measures, it was the best performance since April 21. The Nasdaq composite index ended up 33.62, or 1.6 percent, at 2,115.83.
 Almost 13 stocks rose for every 4 that fell on the Big Board, the highest ratio since Aug. 16, 2004. All 24 industry groups in the S.&P. 500 rose except commercial services, which dropped after Cendant cut its earnings forecast and disclosed plans to split into four companies.
 About a third of the S.&P. 500's members are to announce results this week. Of those that reported through Oct. 21, about two-thirds surpassed analysts' estimates.
 Better-than-expected results and forecasts ''will set us up for a rally here going into the end of the year,'' said Michael T. Viracola, co-head of equities at Adams Harkness in Boston. 
 Stocks today were also supported by a decline in oil prices as Hurricane Wilma missed most of the Gulf of Mexico's production platforms. Crude oil for December delivery lost 0.5 percent, falling to $60.32 a barrel in New York. Falling oil prices have helped investor optimism rebound in October from the lowest in 21/2 years, a poll by UBS and the Gallup Organization showed.
 American Express, the fourth-largest United States credit card company and the best performer in the Dow industrials, climbed $2.39, or 5.1 percent, to $49.54. Earnings at the company were 69 cents a share, above the average estimate of 68 cents in a survey by Thomson. Net income rose 17 percent, to a record $1.03 billion, or 82 cents a share.
 Merck, the third-biggest United States drug maker, gained 82 cents, to $27. Net income last quarter increased to 65 cents a share as the company trimmed costs to prepare for a decline in Zocor sales. Merck was expected to earn 62 cents a share, the average analyst estimate compiled by Thomson.
 Mr. Bernanke's nomination led to confidence the economy could sustain growth. Mr. Bernanke, 51, currently serves as the president's chief economic adviser -- a role that the current Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan, had held earlier -- after spending almost three years as a Fed governor.
 Stocks rallied on ''a sense of relief that the uncertainty is past and that they chose one of the quality, mainstream candidates,'' said Richard B. Hoey, chief economist and investment strategist at the Dreyfus Corporation. 
 But Treasury notes declined amid speculation that Mr. Bernanke might be more concerned about the pace of economic growth and thus willing to permit faster inflation. He has endorsed inflation targeting as a guide to setting rates, which some investors say may serve as a limit on the central bank's resolve to lift interest rates.
 Computer Sciences, which manages and integrates technology systems for the United States military and government departments, surged $5.06, or 11 percent, to $50.41, for the largest jump in the S.&P. 500. 
 Albertson's, a grocer that put itself up for sale in August, climbed $1.19, to $25.25, after receiving the bids. 
 The Altria Group, the world's largest cigarette maker, gained $1.09, to $74.06. The company could announce early next year that it will split into three companies, provided two pending legal decisions go its way, Barron's said on Oct. 22.
 Cendant lost $1.32, or 6.6 percent, to $18.77 for the second-steepest drop in the S.&P. 500. The company trimmed its fourth-quarter forecast to as low as 23 cents a share. The company's founder, Henry R. Silverman, will split Cendant into four units: real estate, travel distribution, hospitality and car rental.
 An index of energy companies gained 3.3 percent, for the best performance among 10 industry groups and its largest advance since July. Investors anticipate better-than-expected earnings reports this week from Exxon Mobil, Chevron and ConocoPhillips.
 Unisys, a seller of computer consulting services, was the worst performer in the S.&P. 500 after saying the government had ''issues'' with a $1 billion contract. The stock tumbled $1.05, or 19 percent, to $4.50. Unisys may have overbilled on a contract to improve the nation's transportation security system, The Washington Post reported. A spokesman for Unisys did not return a call seeking comment.
 Bonds lost ground, with the price of the 10-year Treasury note falling 15/32, to 9815/32, and the yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rising to 4.44 percent, from 4.38 percent on Friday.

HEADLINE: Manhattan Institute Has More Influence Outside New York

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS CONFESSORE

 BODY:
By most measures applicable to the world of ideas, the Manhattan Institute for Policy Research can count itself a success. 
 Founded 25 years ago as a fledgling conservative outpost in the heart of liberal New York City, the institute has become an $11-million-a-year concern, with more than 50 staff members and fellows, and satellite offices in Albany and Washington. Perhaps its proudest achievement was the revolution it helped foment in city government in the 1990's, when it served as an informal brain trust for Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's efforts to reduce crime, overhaul the welfare system and fix city schools.
Validated by Mr. Giuliani's victories, elements of the institute's gospel, from creating workfare to combating serious crime by pursuing minor offenses, have since taken root in cities from Miami to Oakland, Calif., spreading something that hardly existed three decades ago: an identifiably conservative brand of thinking on cities. 
 Yet in an odd twist of fate, the Manhattan Institute today finds itself an unheeded prophet in its hometown, largely frozen out by the Bloomberg administration, whose expansive vision of government clashes with the institute's dogma of a shrinking public sector. In the post-Giuliani era, some of the institute's leading minds have been openly critical of Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, deriding him as an overly cautious politician more interested in placating the city's established political interests than in challenging them. 
 The institute's fellows and staff remain a major presence on op-ed pages in New York and beyond, and its conferences and lectures remain major draws. But it is hard to think of a recent major policy shift or government initiative in New York for which the institute can claim to have served as midwife.
 ''During the early 1990's, the Manhattan Institute had their fingerprints all over City Hall's reforms to crime fighting and welfare,'' said Jonathan Bowles, director of the Center for an Urban Future, a left-leaning New York research group that focuses on economic development and higher education. ''Clearly, they don't have the same level of influence today.''
 Lawrence J. Mone, the institute's president for the past decade, acknowledged that relations with City Hall under Mr. Bloomberg are not as warm as they were during the Giuliani years -- if not as cold as they were under the previous mayor, David N. Dinkins.
 ''We've obviously criticized him on some of his educational policies and some of his tax policies,'' Mr. Mone said of Mr. Bloomberg. ''I think our biggest issue with the mayor is, we think he can and should challenge the status quo more than he does.''
 In part, the changing fortunes of the Manhattan Institute reflect tectonic shifts in New York's political landscape. The city of the 1980's and early 90's -- dangerous, racially polarized and widely considered ungovernable -- has evolved into a somewhat kinder, gentler place. Public intellectuals thrive on solving problems, and New York has fewer troubles than it once did.
 But the change also mirrors the sharply divergent political styles of Mr. Giuliani and his successor. Though Mr. Bloomberg, a fellow Republican, has in some ways advanced Mr. Giuliani's crusades, lowering crime rates and trying to rein in the schools bureaucracy, he has been far less receptive to the institute. 
 ''The Manhattan Institute became the way that Rudy Giuliani got educated on urban policy,'' said Mitchell L. Moss, a professor of urban policy and planning at New York University, who is an unpaid adviser to Mr. Bloomberg. ''And they used him to get out their issues. They embraced each other.''
 Mr. Bloomberg, by contrast, has relied on a broader and more diverse array of experts and advisers, including many he connected with during his career as a business executive and philanthropist. And while Mr. Giuliani roared into office under the banner of a powerful overarching idea, the restoration of the city's ''quality of life,'' Mr. Bloomberg has defined himself as a pragmatist and manager not beholden to grand philosophies or movements.
 ''He doesn't have an ideological opposition to the Manhattan Institute, but nor does he have an ideological affinity that makes him think they're always right,'' said William T. Cunningham, a senior adviser to the mayor's re-election campaign. ''He does govern from the center, and that gets him sniping from the right and the left. But it's also enabled him to get cooperation from a wide variety of institutions in city politics.''
 By the standards of conservatives, Mr. Bloomberg's heresies are numerous. He has forged friendly relations with some unions. He raised taxes to pull the city through its post-Sept. 11 fiscal slump. On housing issues, he has joined with Acorn, a liberal advocacy group. He outlawed smoking in the city's public places, drawing a charge of ''nannyism'' from a Manhattan Institute scholar, Walter Olson.
 The administration's relationship with the institute is by no means rancorous. Mr. Bloomberg spoke at the group's gala award dinner last May . Mr. Mone served on one of the mayor's transition teams, and his staff collaborates closely with the Police Department on issues related to counterterrorism.
 ''I would say that while they have often taken issue on what I may have said or written about their policies, they've always been very professional about it,'' said Edmund J. McMahon, who heads the institute's Albany branch and has frequently criticized the mayor's tax and spending increases. ''They don't seem to take it personally.'' 
 New York City's politics, however, remain basically liberal. And without a patron like Mr. Giuliani, the institute has had a much harder time involving itself in city policymaking.
 ''Traditionally, urban politics was much more about who gets the contract, who gets the playground,'' said David Yassky, a Brooklyn Democrat on the City Council who has occasionally found inspiration in the work of institute scholars. ''What makes them exciting is they're bringing an interest in ideas and policy to city government.
 ''But whereas under Giuliani you saw direct evidence of their reach and of the impact of their ideas, I just do not see that anywhere in the Bloomberg administration -- even on schools, where Bloomberg has been most aggressive in having impact.''
 On some issues, the institute may be a victim of its own success.
 Joseph P. Viteritti, a professor of public policy at Hunter College, said the institute had been ''very active on what people thought were the two paramount issues of New York, crime and education.''
 ''For crime, because so much has been done there, it's not much of a hot-button issue,'' he said. ''And now we're going through the same process on education.'' The institute also faces stiffer competition than before from other research organizations, some of which say it has neglected to shift its attention to newer issues. 
 ''When you think about what the main issues of the day are in New York -- transportation, housing, economic development in the outer boroughs -- they aren't the ones the Manhattan Institute has put on the agenda,'' said Mr. Bowles, of the Center for an Urban Future.
 The institute has also had to weather shifts in political tides elsewhere. During the late 1980's and early 90's, it became a national clearinghouse for mayors eager to road-test new approaches to municipal governing. In Indianapolis, Stephen Goldsmith earned national accolades for his work on welfare reform, and in Jersey City, Bret Schundler experimented with health savings accounts and privatized management of the city's water utilities.
 But few politicians associated with the institute have vaulted to higher office. Mr. Goldsmith is now a professor at Harvard; Mr. Schundler failed in two runs for governor of New Jersey. 
 ''It's a problem,'' said Mr. Mone, the institute's president. ''There have not been natural successors to that generation.''
 The institute has responded by finding new issues that have greater currency, and by returning to earlier hobbyhorses that are back in vogue. The institute's anticrime program has developed a new focus on antiterrorist policing. Where the institute once published noteworthy books on race relations, its scholars are now more likely to weigh in on federal policies on guest workers. The institute has rekindled its efforts to reduce tort lawsuits and begun a new initiative on medical policies, like streamlining federal approval of new drugs.
 Not coincidentally, such issues are at the heart of the Republican agenda in Washington, offering the institute a new vector for intellectual influence, though at some cost to its identity as a creature of the metropolis. Though the institute formerly devoted most of its attention to urban affairs, Mr. Mone estimates that at least half of its research now applies to issues that are national in scope.
 ''We kind of press the buttons and look for opportunities to effect change,'' he said. ''On one hand, you have a Mayor Bloomberg who may not be receptive to the same reform ideas. On the other hand, you've got a George W. Bush elected, and all of sudden tort reform, which wasn't a real possibility in the 1990's, becomes so.''
 ''Sometimes,'' Mr. Mone added, ''it's just a question of whether an issue is on the front burner or not. And sometimes it's a political opportunity.''

HEADLINE: Bush Names a Top Adviser To Be Chairman of the Fed

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 24 

 BODY:
President Bush on Monday nominated Ben S. Bernanke, a senior White House adviser and a highly regarded academic economist, to succeed Alan Greenspan as Federal Reserve chairman.
 If confirmed by the Senate, Mr. Bernanke, 51, will assume the most powerful economic post in the United States -- and arguably the world -- with a promise to continue the anti-inflation policies of Mr. Greenspan, a man who has achieved, for many, a kind of mythic reputation in 18 years at the helm of the economy.
At the same time, though, Mr. Bernanke has indicated that he wants to nudge the Fed away from Mr. Greenspan's highly personal approach to guiding monetary policy and toward a more predictable and open approach based on explicit rules. 
 The long-awaited announcement Monday prompted cheers from economists, support from members of Congress and a jump in stock prices on Wall Street.
 In nominating Mr. Bernanke (pronounced ber-NANK-ee), chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, Mr. Bush appears to have opted for the safest and most independent choice among the leading candidates for the job. And in doing so, he may have won a temporary respite from the storm of criticism over his nomination of Harriet E. Miers to the Supreme Court.
 Mr. Bernanke's nomination was in many respects the economic equivalent of choosing John G. Roberts Jr. to be chief justice: a candidate with sterling academic credentials and little or no taint of cronyism, and a sphinx on significant political issues.
 A former professor of economics at Princeton University and a former Fed governor, Mr. Bernanke is a leading authority on monetary policy but a comparative outsider in partisan politics and ideological warfare.
 At Princeton, he was a prolific author and a longstanding advocate of greater openness at the Fed. But he wrote and said almost nothing about Republican goals like tax cuts and the overhaul of Social Security. [Man in the News, Page C1.]
 As a Fed governor, from 2002 to early this year, he openly disagreed with Mr. Greenspan on at least one issue -- whether the Fed should declare inflation targets -- but he forged a close working relationship with Mr. Greenspan, whose views Mr. Bernanke strongly influenced on a number of issues.
 ''It's a wonderful appointment,'' said Kenneth Rogoff, a professor of economics at Harvard University who worked with Mr. Bernanke at Princeton. ''The whole economics world is cheering about it.''
 Mr. Bernanke had weaker political ties to Mr. Bush and to Republican leaders than the two other candidates mentioned most frequently for the Fed: Martin S. Feldstein, a professor at Harvard and former economic adviser to President Ronald Reagan; and R. Glenn Hubbard, head of the Council of Economic Advisers during Mr. Bush's first two years.
 People close to the White House say that Mr. Bush's closest advisers were always lukewarm about Mr. Feldstein. Some never forgave him for criticizing budget deficits under President Reagan while he was a top Reagan adviser -- an act that might be considered disloyal in the current Bush administration.
 Mr. Hubbard was an architect of Mr. Bush's tax cuts in 2001 and 2003, but people close to the administration say he never had a close personal rapport with the president.
 Mr. Hubbard had his own reservations about moving back to Washington, according to those who knew him. Although strongly supportive of Mr. Bush's economic policies, he remained aloof when Mr. Bush began to promote a sweeping tax overhaul. 
 Mr. Bernanke, who remained studiously nonpartisan while at the Federal Reserve, became a loyal promoter of Mr. Bush's economic policies as soon as he took over in June as head of the Council of Economic Advisers. But to the extent that Mr. Bush's tax cuts or his spending plans lead to wider deficits, they could conflict with Mr. Bernanke's mandate to fight inflation.
 Paradoxically, Mr. Bernanke owed his rise in Washington in part to Mr. Hubbard, who urged the Bush administration to name Mr. Bernanke as a Fed governor in 2002.
 Despite being a newcomer, Mr. Bernanke soon asserted himself as an authoritative voice on the Fed, speaking on a wide range of topics but avoiding clashes with either the White House or Mr. Greenspan.
 In a brief statement at the Oval Office on Monday with Mr. Bernanke and Mr. Greenspan at his side, Mr. Bush said, ''Ben Bernanke is the right man to build on the record Alan Greenspan has established.''
 Mr. Bernanke noted that the Fed would ''continue to evolve'' in the years ahead. But in a bid to soothe anxieties in the financial markets, he emphasized his intention to preserve stability and manage a smooth transition from one Fed chairman to another. 
 ''My first priority will be to maintain continuity with the policies and policy strategies during the Greenspan years,'' Mr. Bernanke declared.
 His nomination was generally greeted favorably on Capitol Hill and he is expected to win confirmation from the Senate in plenty of time to take over when Mr. Greenspan retires at the end of January.
 ''I think it's a good appointment,'' said Senator Richard C. Shelby, Republican of Alabama and chairman of the Banking Committee. Mr. Shelby said he hoped to complete hearings on Mr. Bernanke's nomination, and perhaps a confirmation vote by the full Senate, by the end of this month.
 Senate Democrats, while praising Mr. Bernanke's credentials as an economist, signaled that they would question him about his support for Mr. Bush's economic policies.
 ''We need a careful, nonideological person who understands that the Federal Reserve's main job is to fight inflation, and Ben Bernanke seems to fit that bill,'' said Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York and a member of the Banking Committee. 
 In Europe, Jean-Claude Trichet, president of the European Central Bank, offered his support. ''Ben Bernanke is a highly respected central banker, a remarkable economist and a man of experience,'' he said. ''I will be very happy to have the possibility to develop with him the same highly close and fruitful cooperation, and enjoy the same confident and friendly personal relationship that I had with Alan Greenspan.''
 If confirmed, Mr. Bernanke will almost certainly embrace the same goals as Mr. Greenspan: a top priority on keeping inflation low, around 2 percent a year or less, and encouraging as much economic growth as possible within that constraint. 
 ''There's a broad domestic consensus about what constitutes good monetary policy -- that low and stable inflation produces better outcomes,'' said John Lipsky, senior economist at J.P. Morgan Securities. ''Anti-inflationary policies have been followed vigorously through administrations with both parties and with Fed chairmen appointed by both parties. The fundamentals of monetary policy have ceased to seem as a partisan issue.''
 But Mr. Bernanke will be taking over at a moment when inflation is accelerating for the first time in many years, though still at a relatively mild pace. And he could place more emphasis on applying consistent policy rules. Implicit in his call for the Fed to adopt an inflation target is the idea that monetary policy should be less personalized and less tied to the instincts of a single person.
 When he first took over at the Fed, Mr. Greenspan faced considerable skepticism from investors, who feared that he could not match the inflation-fighting toughness of his predecessor, Paul A. Volcker.
 Mr. Greenspan began establishing his own reputation two months later, when the stock market crashed in October 1987. Reacting coolly but boldly, Mr. Greenspan flooded the financial markets with money and quickly reduced interest rates.
 The markets soon stabilized, Mr. Greenspan eventually began raising rates again in a series of steps that ultimately contributed to a recession, but the bull market quickly resumed a climb that lasted for a decade.
 Mr. Bernanke's reputation and his power may ultimately depend on his response to a similar baptism of fire. 
 Some economists worry that the Fed under Mr. Bernanke could become too academic, losing some of Mr. Greenspan's intuition in recognizing critical changes long before they show up in traditional economic models. 
 ''He's not a maestro, he's a music teacher,'' said Richard Yamarone, chief economist at Argus Research. ''An academic is not the right person for this job.''
 In the mid-1990's, Mr. Greenspan bucked conventional wisdom and much of the Fed's own staff by arguing that productivity was rising more rapidly than the official data showed and that the economy could grow more rapidly than previously thought without provoking inflation. 
 Mr. Greenspan turned out to be correct, but his methods and his approach were almost impossible to distill into any kind of formula. 
 In a brief written statement, Mr. Greenspan warmly endorsed Mr. Bernanke as his successor. ''Ben comes with superb academic credentials and important insights into the ways our economy functions,'' he said. ''I have no doubt that he will be a credit to the nation as chairman of the Federal Reserve Board.''

HEADLINE: Dolans Drop Plan to Take Cablevision Private 

BYLINE: By GERALDINE FABRIKANT; Andrew Ross Sorkin contributed reporting for this article.

 BODY:
The Charles Dolan family withdrew its bid yesterday to take the Cablevision Systems Corporation private, after negotiating since June, and asked directors to approve a $3 billion dividend to shareholders.
 The family, which controls 71 percent of the vote and 22 percent of the equity in Cablevision, issued a terse statement yesterday saying that it ''has become clear that we will be unable to reach an agreement'' with directors.
A dividend would net the Dolan family $600 million. 
 The reversal again raised speculation about what the Dolans would do next. Since April, Charles F. Dolan, who had been at odds with his son, James L. Dolan, Cablevision's chief executive, over the elder Mr. Dolan's support for the satellite television service Voom, have reconciled. Whether that reconciliation muted Mr. Dolan's appetite to take Cablevision private and spin off its entertainment programming unit remains unclear.
 Several people close to the company said that the board's special transaction committee, which was reviewing the Dolans' offer, thought that it was too low and asked the family to increase the amount based on the board's projections of cash flows. 
 According to one person close to the company, the Dolans told the board last week that the projections were wrong and that they would make a final decision on Monday. But on Monday, this person said, the family told directors that they were withdrawing the offer.
 The Dolans had offered $21 a share for the Cablevision cable systems company and $12.50 a share for a stake in Rainbow Media Holdings, its cable networks company that includes American Movie Classics, Independent Film Channel and Women's Entertainment, for a total bid of $33.50 a share. 
 Yesterday, Cablevision's stock fell 12.73 percent, to close at $24.26. 
 In a statement, the Dolans said yesterday that they could not reach a deal with the special transaction committee. It added that there had been a ''decline in communications valuations and an increased competitive environment.'' 
 The Dolans were referring to increased efforts by satellite broadcast companies to lure viewers and the phone companies' efforts to compete in the video, voice and data delivery businesses. Since the beginning of July, shares in the Comcast Corporation, the nation's largest cable operator, have fallen 8.5 percent, to close yesterday at $27.84 a share. 
 Although the Dolans declined to comment beyond their statement, people close to the company said that they believed that when the family made its offer, Charles Dolan, the 79-year-old chairman, knew he would have to increase it. But in the next four months, Mr. Dolan may have decided against doing so.
 According to Christopher J. Marangi, a media analyst at Gabelli & Company, which owns 22 million shares of Cablevision, the Dolans were offering about 9.5 times this year's cash flow for the company. That is slightly under the 10.4 times cash flow that the Cox family paid for Cox Cable when it took the company private in December. 
 Several analysts noted that they thought the initial offer by Mr. Dolan was low and they expected Mr. Dolan to raise the bid because the Cablevision subscribers, clustered in the New York market, are considered more valuable than those at other companies, including Comcast. 
 As the deal was structured, the Dolans planned to raise $4.25 billion in high-yield corporate bonds and $2.3 billion from two loans. It also planned a $500 million revolving credit line.
 Several analysts said yesterday that it was the changing economic outlook for cable that stopped the Dolans from raising their bid by $2 or $3 a share. But others speculated that Charles Dolan had never intended to take the company private, but was using the bid only to prompt another bidder, like Time Warner, to come forward. Time Warner is viewed as the likely buyer for Cablevision's cable systems because of their proximity to the Time Warner systems. A spokesman for Time Warner had no comment. 
 James S. Chanos, whose fund Kynikos Associates bets on companies' stocks declining, said yesterday that ''it was never a serious offer; it was an attempt to flush out another buyer.'' Mr. Chanos is shorting Comcast and Cablevision. 
 In either case, Mario J. Gabelli, chief executive of Gamco Investors, a mutual fund advisory firm, said he hoped that the company would now put itself up for sale. 
 ''If they don't think the values are there, they should just put the company up for sale and see if there is a buyer at valuations that are more akin to what we think are out there,'' Mr. Gabelli said. ''Maybe there is a buyer out there which would show whether the Dolans have made a lowball bid or have the values really come down. It will be interesting to see whether there is another buyer. ''
 Earlier this year, Charles Dolan, angered that his board did not support his efforts to start Voom, replaced some board members with outside members who were longtime Dolan friends and veteran media executives. The new board members included Brian Sweeney, Leonard Tow, John C. Malone, Rand V. Araskog and Frank J. Biondi Jr. Mr. Malone has since resigned from the board. More recently Thomas C. Dolan, Charles Dolan's son, was succeeded by Marianne Dolan Weber, Mr. Dolan's daughter. 
 However, none of the newcomers is on the special transaction committee, which includes Thomas J. Reifenheiser and Admiral John R. Ryan, longtime board members. 
 Several analysts said yesterday that they did not support a $3 billion dividend because it would add to the leverage at Cablevision, which already carries a debt to cash flow ratio of 5.2 to 1.
 The proposed dividend payment would translate to $10.25 for each subscriber and, if the company borrowed the money, would raise the ratio to seven to one. 
 ''We think that even the Dolans doubt that the special committee would approve the $3 billion dividend because it would lever the company up too much,'' said Thomas W. Eagan, who follows the company for Oppenheimer & Company. 
 Craig Moffett, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Company, said, ''The Dolans may also have gotten nervous because credit spreads have widened so that if they raised money by selling high-yield bonds they would have had to pay a higher interest rate, which would have made the buyout more expensive.''

HEADLINE: Home Sale Prices Decline; Consumer Confidence Drops 

BYLINE: By VIKAS BAJAJ

 BODY:
Sales prices for existing homes fell last month and total sales stayed flat, according to a report released yesterday, providing further indications that the housing boom is starting to cool.
 Total home sales were still at their second-highest pace on record in September, the National Association of Realtors said, as people displaced by Hurricane Katrina snapped up homes in nearby cities with the help of employers and quick-moving mortgage lenders.
In other reports, consumer confidence in October fell unexpectedly for the second consecutive month as Americans grew more pessimistic about higher energy costs and the prospects for finding new jobs later this year, the Conference Board reported yesterday. 
 Home sales in September were unchanged at an annual pace of 7.28 million, second only to 7.35 million homes sold in June, the National Association of Realtors reported. But the median price -- meaning that half of the homes sold for more and half for less -- fell 3.6 percent, to $212,000. The price of condominiums and co-ops fell more steeply, dropping 4.6 percent, to $213,600. Home prices are still up 13.4 percent since September 2004.
 The data appear to corroborate other recent reports showing sales stabilizing, prices dipping and homes staying on the market for a slightly longer period.
 ''It would be difficult to go much more beyond the current housing activity,'' said Michael Moran, chief economist at Daiwa Securities America in New York. ''It's not troubling that we would see a flattening in home sales and housing starts.''
 Mortgage interest rates, a major factor driving home sales in recent years, have climbed in recent weeks: the national average for a 30-year mortgage was 6.10 percent last week, up from 5.77 percent in January, according to Freddie Mac.
 Low rates and the increase in interest-only and adjustable-rate mortgages have made home buying more affordable, and they also appear to have increased speculative buying and selling of condominiums and second homes in some hot housing markets.
 The National Association of Realtors said the data showed that the housing market was gliding to a slower but more sustainable pace. ''The demand is still there,'' said David A. Lereah, chief economist for the group. ''I think some people may be pausing, they may be looking to see the shape the market is in. They will come right back in springtime.''
 Home sales were strongest in the South, up 3.7 percent, to an annual pace of 2.83 million, and Mr. Lereah said the data indicated that a surge of transactions in cities like Baton Rouge, La., more than made up for lost sales in New Orleans and other devastated regions.
 The data from the National Association of Realtors measures the closing of sale contracts. Hurricane Katrina made landfall at the end of August and the fact that so many people were able to close on homes in nearby cities in September was surprising.
 ''Anecdotally, we are getting reports that employers are going out of their way and helping their employees relocate and buying some of this inventory in places like Baton Rouge,'' Mr. Lereah said. Lenders may also have accelerated home closings to help evacuees, he added. 
 Sales fell in the West, down 4.1 percent, and the Midwest, down 3 percent, while the Northeast eked out a 0.8 percent gain. There was a 4.7 months supply of homes on the market, unchanged from August but up from 4.2 months last year. There was a 5.3 month supply of condos and co-ops, up from 4.3 months in September 2004.
 As for consumer confidence, the Conference Board reported that its index fell to 85 this month after it plummeted to 87.5 in September from 105.5 in August. 
 Consumers said they were more optimistic about the current situation than they were about the coming months, when heating bills are expected to soar. Economists had expected the confidence index to turn up to 88 this month, according to Bloomberg News.

HEADLINE: German Business Confidence at 5-Year High 

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER

DATELINE: FRANKFURT, Oct. 25 

 BODY:
The German economy, which has taken one step back for every two steps forward since the recession of 2003, may finally be on firm footing, according to an influential survey released here on Tuesday.
 The Ifo survey of business confidence rose 2.7 points in October, to 98.7, its highest level in five years. It was the largest monthly increase since November 1999. The survey, which measures the expectations of German businesses, has risen in five of the last six months.
''I think we can say we have turned the corner,'' said Gernot Nerb, the director of analysis at the Ifo Institute for Economic Research in Munich. ''Investments are picking up, and consumers are starting to spend money.'' 
 Germany generates one-third of the economic output of the 12-nation European Monetary Union, so its uneven performance has been a drag on the rest of the Continent. The recent election here, with its murky result and ensuing power struggle, intensified fears that Germany would remain mired.
 But the emergence of Angela Merkel, the conservative leader, as the designated chancellor of a ''grand coalition'' government seems to have soothed the uncertainties of German businesspeople.
 Even German retailers, which have suffered mightily, are expressing more confidence about the future, Mr. Nerb said. The survey is based on responses from 7,000 companies in manufacturing, construction, wholesaling and retailing.
 The unexpectedly positive survey helped the euro gain almost 1 percent against the dollar, to $1.2096 a euro, in trading in New York. It also uncorked a new round of speculation that the European Central Bank would raise interest rates, perhaps as early as December.
 In recent weeks, top officials at the bank have signaled their readiness to tighten monetary policy to respond to the inflationary pressure of high oil prices. But the bank has held off because, outsiders say, it has been looking for signs of firmer growth in Europe, especially in Germany.
 Recent surveys have also shown improved confidence in France, the Netherlands and Belgium.
 ''There is clearly a risk now that they might be bold enough to tighten policy in December,'' said Lorenzo Codogno, an economist at Bank of America in London. But he added, ''We think they will wait until March.''
 These surveys, Mr. Codogno said, are not by themselves enough evidence that Europe is entering a period of sustained growth. Consumer spending, while better, remains fragile, he noted. And a slowdown in global growth next year, as some economists predict, would dent Europe's exports.
 Last week, Germany's six leading economic research institutes revised their forecast for growth this year to 0.8 percent from 0.7 percent. But they cut the number for 2006 to 1.2 percent from 1.5 percent.
 ''I expect that after this quite good second half, Germany will sink back to anemic growth next year,'' said Jorg Kramer, the chief economist of the HVB Group in Munich.
 Mr. Kramer noted that the new German government was not likely to pursue radical changes in the labor market, as Mrs. Merkel once advocated. That will limit the number of new jobs generated, he said.
 Leaders of Germany's two main parties met for a second time on Monday to work out a coalition agreement. At issue was how the government would cut its budget to comply with the European Union's deficit limits.
 Mrs. Merkel's party, the Christian Democratic Union, said Tuesday that she would be confirmed as chancellor by Parliament on Nov. 22 if the parties resolve their differences by then.

HEADLINE: The Spirit of Indulgence Grows Up

BYLINE: By SHIVANI VORA

 BODY:
FOR more than two months, Dave Weiss has been painstakingly planning the details of his Halloween celebration. Last year, he and his wife, Katie Harrigan, carved pumpkins and labored for several hours in their Hoboken apartment to make a chicken pie with sherry shallot jus gravy. They bought Smuttynose Pumpkin Ale, baked ghost-shape cookies and savored their favorite sweet, the dark chocolate pumpkin from La Maison du Chocolat. But the pumpkin has competition this year.
 Mr. Weiss, a 32-year-old photo transmissions manager, is tempted by the spiced pumpkin-shaped cake at Dean & Deluca. 
 ''I buy the chocolates every year,'' he said, ''but this cake just looks so good.''
 The couple are as hooked on Halloween as any 8-year-olds.
 ''As I'm getting older, I find Halloween becoming my favorite holiday,'' Mr. Weiss said. ''It's the perfect time for a foodie like me.''
 According to retailers, Halloween now has a distinctly adult mood. Anna Baxter Kirk, a spokeswoman for the online costume store BuyCostumes.com, said the sales for adult Halloween costumes are slated to overtake those of children's for the first time this year. But for adults, Halloween is also about fancy candy, sophisticated food and drink, and perhaps above all, having an excuse to indulge.
 Cress Templeton, 46, a lawyer from Bel Air, Calif., said many of his neighbors hold open houses on Halloween.
 ''People buy cases of good wine and get platters of appetizers. Last year, my wife and I bought sushi rolls and salmon tarts,'' Mr. Templeton said. ''The adults go from house to house drinking and eating away.''
 Chandrika Tandon, a 50-year-old businesswoman who lives on the Upper East Side, said she looks forward to her building's Halloween open house.
 Last year, she said, ''there was a lot of food from Eli's Vinegar Factory like shrimp cocktail and cheese pies.'' 
 Stacy Hoffman, a 35-year-old giftware company owner in Manhattan, said that Halloween is increasingly becoming an occasion like New Year's Eve, when adults feel they can drink a little more than usual. ''The funky cocktails only add to the festive spirit,'' she said.
 ''Baby boomers are driving the adultification of Halloween,'' said Susan Fussel, spokeswoman for the National Confectioners Association. ''Trick-or-treating didn't really take off and become big until the baby boomer generation,'' she said.
 Candy sales account for $2 billion of the $3 billion Halloween industry, Ms. Fussel said. There are no specific figures on upscale candy, which she said makes up more and more of overall sales. 
 Retailers have been quick to try to satisfy customers' craving. La Maison du Chocolat, based in Paris, started catering to the Halloween market five years ago at the request of American customers, said Nora Hovanesian-Mann, who manages the Madison Avenue branch. 
 ''Since Halloween is not celebrated in France, we created products for our American customers and were stunned by how well they were received,'' she said. A top-selling item is the $50 chocolate pumpkin filled with caramelized roasted almonds, Mr. Weiss's usual splurge.
 At Neiman Marcus, Halloween is the second biggest holiday for sales, trailing only Christmas, said Diane Somers, a merchandise manager. Its Halloween items include a $70 box of 18 Eleni's cookies shaped like bats and ghosts.
 Some adults prefer candy that reminds them of childhood. Jerry Cohen, the owner of Economy Candy on the Lower East Side, said that in the last five years he has had to order more of the candy he ate while growing up in the 50's and 60's. 
 ''The Wack-o-Wax Lips, the Mary Janes,'' he said. ''These adults want all the candy from when they were young.'' 
 Nostalgic candy holds less interest for Dave Weiss. He is deliberating over the chocolate pumpkin and the spiced cake.
 ''We've already bought our pumpkin beer, but I'm not sure what the rest of the menu is yet,'' he says. ''I do know that it will be a memorable meal.''

HEADLINE: German Labor's New Reality

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER

DATELINE: HANOVER, Germany, Oct. 19 

 BODY:
Hartmut Meine's office here overlooks an old graveyard. It is a fitting view for a man who is waging a twilight battle to keep his 114-year-old labor union viable, as global competition threatens to undo half a century of rights and privileges won by millions of German workers.
 In the last month, Mr. Meine's union, IG Metall, has reached three wage deals with Volkswagen. In each case, VW demanded -- and won -- significant concessions, partly by threatening to move the production of one car to Portugal, where hourly wages are less than a third of those in Germany.
''It has become much more difficult,'' said Mr. Meine, the chief negotiator for 103,000 Volkswagen workers in Germany. ''But we've also learned how to deal with these more difficult conditions.'' 
 Just as the American auto industry and its workers are facing stark choices between reducing costs and preserving a social compact that has long provided generous wages and benefits, Germans are confronting the grim arithmetic of the global economy: most industrial workers here are paid far too much to compete with those in Eastern Europe and Asia. 
 German carmakers have not yet embarked on the wholesale job cuts and benefit givebacks that are now so prominently on the table in Detroit. But that day of reckoning will come before long, labor experts predict. Already, IG Metall has had to accept lower wages for some of its members, fewer work breaks and the likely loss of several thousand jobs at Volkswagen's flagship factory in Wolfsburg, not far from here.
 Those cuts, which Mr. Meine said could be announced early next month, would be made through voluntary buyouts rather than forced layoffs. But tensions are building across German industry, fraying the relationship between workers and management, which over the years has been more harmonious than that in the United States.
 By American standards, Germany remains a workers' paradise. It even stands out in labor-friendly Western Europe, with its unions still retaining significant power and its workers enjoying more time off than those in most other countries. 
 The average hourly cost of an auto worker in western Germany is the highest in the industry, at $40.80. That compares with $35.40 in Japan, $34.80 in the United States, $27.60 in France and $5.40 in Slovakia, where Volkswagen has an assembly plant.
 Moreover, strict job-protection laws make it hard for companies to fire German employees, and those who are laid off receive substantial unemployment benefits. But now Volkswagen, Siemens, DaimlerChrysler and others are moving, or threatening to move, thousands of jobs out of the country. That has put once-impregnable unions like IG Metall, which represents metalworkers in several industries, on the defensive.
 Membership in IG Metall declined to 2.4 million in 2004 from its peak of 3.4 million in 1992, though the numbers at Volkswagen are stable. The membership figures reflect both the steady loss of manufacturing jobs in Germany, and the union's lack of success in some recent bargaining sessions.
 Since 1992, according to a study by the HVB Group, IG Metall has been able to push through less than half of its wage demands, compared with 70 percent of them from 1970 to 1991. 
 ''German workers today are prepared to accept many more conditions than they were even a few years ago,'' said Ludger Pries, a professor of sociology and expert in labor relations at Ruhr University in Bochum. ''There's a new kind of global concession bargaining being practiced.''
 Adding to the pressure is a five-year slump in the German economy. With four million people out of work, Germany's jobless rate of 9.3 percent is already close to a post-World War II record.
 The recent election in Germany showed just how divided the nation is over the best response to the economic headwinds. Angela Merkel, the conservative leader and chancellor-designate, campaigned on a platform of weakening the unions. Among Mrs. Merkel's proposals was a measure that would make it easier for employers to negotiate deals with workers that deviate from industrywide pay contracts. She also favored giving companies with 20 or fewer workers more freedom to hire and fire. 
 But Mrs. Merkel's paper-thin victory forced her into a power-sharing arrangement with the Social Democratic Party, a bastion of German workers. The Social Democrats oppose her plans to overhaul the labor market, which probably means that the plans will be shelved for the foreseeable future.
 While the government may not be a change agent, it is unlikely to stand in the way, either. A day after the election last month, Siemens announced that it would cut 2,400 jobs in Germany -- eliciting barely a peep from officials in Berlin. ''It's one thing for the government to say to workers, 'We're on your side,' and another for them to stop companies from negotiating special deals,'' said Klaus F. Zimmermann, the president of the German Institute for Economic Research in Berlin. 
 At the same time, a new generation of German managers is taking control of the country's leading companies. Some of these managers ran the American subsidiaries of their companies, where they got a taste of how global competition plays out in a toughened labor market.
 ''When you've been through this before, you know it works; you can see how to make it work,'' said Wolfgang Bernhard, the senior executive for Volkswagen, who is behind the cost-cutting campaign.
 Mr. Bernhard came to Volkswagen last year from Chrysler, where he and his former boss, Dieter Zetsche, stanched huge financial losses, in part by cutting 26,000 jobs and closing six factories.
 Mr. Zetsche recently returned to Germany, too, to take the top job at the parent company, DaimlerChrysler. He has already announced 8,500 job cuts at Daimler's Mercedes-Benz factories in Germany.
 In addition, Mr. Zetsche said Chrysler would seek cuts in the health care and pension benefits it pays to American workers, retirees and their families to match the $1 billion in savings that General Motors just extracted from the United Automobile Workers union.
 German carmakers, at least, do not face the ballooning health and pension obligations of their American counterparts, since the majority of those benefits are shouldered by the state.
 But that is cold comfort to German executives, given the high wages, long vacations and lifetime job security that they have negotiated for rank-and-file workers.
 ''We always thought in Western Europe that because of our high productivity and flexible work force, we could demand higher wages,'' Mr. Bernhard said in a telephone interview. ''Now, with the emergence of Eastern Europe and some Asian competitors, we see that they can get to the same productivity levels, with a much lower hourly wage base,'' he said. ''This fundamentally changes the German model.'' The givebacks being negotiated at Volkswagen and DaimlerChrysler come after both companies signed deals last fall that essentially guaranteed most workers jobs through the end of the decade. Only in cases of severe financial distress can these contracts be torn up.
 ''That stabilized the current work force a little, but bigger cuts are still in the pipeline,'' said Ferdinand Dudenhoffer, director of the Center for Automotive Research in Gelsenkirchen. '' The next big debate in Germany will be over the length of the workweek.''
 Even smaller German companies are eager to drive a harder bargain with workers. Udo Pfeiffer, who runs a medium-size machinery business in the Rhineland, would like his 280 employees to work 40 hours a week, instead of 35 hours, the ceiling under their IG Metall contract.
 ''Each hour less per week costs me500,000 euros in profit,'' or nearly $605,000, Mr. Pfeiffer said. ''At least we should go back to the 40-hour week, maybe even a 45-hour week.''
 IG Metall has resisted most efforts to lengthen working hours, though Siemens was able to negotiate a deal last year to extend the workweek to 40 hours, without raising wages, at a cordless-telephone factory in Bocholt. It did so by threatening to move production to Hungary.
 Pessimistic that he will be able to extract a similar agreement, Mr. Pfeiffer says he is thinking of building a factory in China.
 Volkswagen's cost-cutting has become something of a bellwether, because its labor-management relations were once viewed as a model for German industry. Hourly wages for assembly-line workers in Wolfsburg are 20 percent higher than at other German carmakers, thanks to the company's ''house pay scale,'' which applies only to Volkswagen.
 In a previous financial crisis in 1993, Volkswagen threatened to cut 30,000 jobs. Instead, the company and the union negotiated a landmark deal to cut the workweek to four days. Workers kept their jobs, but had to accept what amounted to a 16 percent reduction in wages.
 Today, Volkswagen is in similar straits, with anemic sales and plunging profit, particularly in the United States. Mr. Bernhard has pledged to reduce costs by 5 billion euros ($6.05 billion) by 2008.
 To reach that goal, Volkswagen must steeply cut its labor costs. Shortening the workweek even further, the union and the company agree, is not an option. The mammoth Wolfsburg plant is running at only 65 percent of its capacity, suggesting that thousands of workers could be laid off.
 Mr. Bernhard, noting that Volkswagen workers wish each other a good weekend on Thursday evening, said, ''We will not survive in the international labor market with these work hours.''
 Volkswagen's solution is to find ways around its contract. Last month, it agreed to build a new sport utility vehicle in Wolfsburg rather than in Portugal -- but only after the union agreed to exempt those workers from its regular contract, meaning that they will earn 20 percent less than everyone else.
 ''We'd like to spread it to the rest of the company in Germany,'' Mr. Bernhard said of the wage deal, which is known as Auto 5000. ''But it takes two to tango.''
 Mr. Meine, the union leader, unsurprisingly is resistant. He said it was unfair to expect Volkswagen's current workers to accept wage reductions, which would lower their living standards.
 Despite the pressure, Mr. Meine said he was confident that Germany would be able to avoid the hire-and-fire culture of the United States. The solution, he said, was to make German workers more flexible. He even managed to sound a swaggering note about his talks with Mr. Bernhard.
 ''He has to make compromises,'' Mr. Meine said, ''when he is negotiating with a strong and powerful union like IG Metall.''

HEADLINE: Technology Shares Lead Downturn as Oil Prices Surge

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News

 BODY:
Stocks failed to escape their October slump yesterday as a disappointing forecast from Texas Instruments and this month's biggest jump in oil prices hurt the market.
 Technology shares paced the decline along with retailers, which were brought down by an unexpected drop in consumer confidence to a two-year low.
 ''I don't think we're going to get out of this malaise for a while,'' said Michael Vogelzang, president and chief investment officer at Boston Advisors. ''There's been nothing terribly dynamic from earnings and we're seeing a lot of pressure on the consumer as we head into the holiday season.'' 
 The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 2.84, or 0.2 percent, to 1,196.54. The Nasdaq composite index lost 6.38, or 0.3 percent, to 2,109.45.
 A gain in DuPont, which announced a $5 billion stock buyback, kept the Dow Jones industrial average from falling further. The index slipped 7.13, or 0.1 percent, to 10,377.87. DuPont rose $1.18, or 3 percent, to $40.80.
 The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note rose to 4.53 percent, from 4.44 percent. The price fell 22/32, to 9725/32. Bond prices move inversely to yields.
 Texas Instruments, the world's No.1 maker of mobile phone processors, lost $2.37, to $28.55, and was the top contributor to the S.&P. 500's retreat. Profit excluding some costs will be 39 cents to 43 cents this quarter, the company said, compared with a 41-cent average of estimates by analysts surveyed by Thomson Financial.
 Technology shares fell 0.7 percent as a group and were the biggest contributor to the S.&P. 500's loss. Altera, the world's No.2 maker of programmable semiconductors, slumped $1.30, to $16.43. The company said fourth-quarter sales would be unchanged from the $291.5 million in the previous period. 
 Crude oil for December delivery climbed 2.12 percent, to $62.44 a barrel in New York, the biggest gain since Sept. 19.
 The Conference Board's consumer confidence index fell to 85 this month, a two-year low, from 87.5 in September. Another confidence measure from the University of Michigan is scheduled for release on Friday.
 Amazon.com, the online retailer, slipped 76 cents, to $46.17. After the market's close, the company said third-quarter earnings fell to 7 cents a share as it increased discounts and spending.
 EBay, the Internet auctioneer, slid $1.41, to $38.01. Google, the search engine, is testing a service that may let users sell products online, posing a threat to eBay. Google slipped $1.74, to $346.91.
 Sherwin-Williams slid $4.08, or 9.1 percent, to $40.75 for the second-biggest drop in the S.&P. 500. Sherwin-Williams, the largest United States paint retailer, cut its 2005 earnings forecast to as much as $3.23 a share, down from a July estimate of as much as $3.30.
 Following are the results of yesterday's Treasury auction of one-month bills and inflation-protected five-year notes.

HEADLINE: On High-Stakes Tables in Las Vegas: Fish, Not Chips

BYLINE: By R.W. APPLE Jr.

DATELINE: LAS VEGAS 

 BODY:
JOEL ROBUCHON and his creations travel very nicely, thank you.
 His newest venture, Joel Robuchon at the Mansion, which opened on Monday in the MGM Grand hotel here, represents a leap back into the rarefied realm of haute cuisine, from which he ''retired'' in 1996. During the tryouts preceding its official debut, the restaurant served the best food in Las Vegas, by a decisive margin, and some of the very best French food I have ever eaten on this continent.
This is no revolutionary Robuchon, like his Ateliers (including one here and, soon, in New York), where one eats at a counter and talks to the chefs. It is no casual, scaled-down, moderately priced Robuchon, like La Table de Joel Robuchon in the chic 16th Arrondissement, and its counterparts in Monte Carlo and Asia. This is full-scale, damn-the-torpedoes, three-stars-or-bust Robuchon, worldly, luxurious, costly.
 Getting there is none of the fun. You walk through the crass clamor of hundreds of slot machines, past a Starbucks and other lesser diversions and into a bombastic stone doorway more suited to a central bank than a casino. But inside you are in Paris, in a subdued neo-Deco room lighted by a glamorous Swarovski crystal chandelier, furnished with handsome chairs in the fashion of Ruhlmann and graced by Lalique vases. 
 A small glass of lemon gelee flavored with vanilla and topped with an anisette-infused cream sets the tone straight away -- a complex, entirely original and appetite-rousing prelude to the many delights that lie ahead, and a vivid demonstration of the French master's familiar maxim that three tastes in any one dish are quite enough.
 Mr. Robuchon's arrival signals another step in the evolution of Las Vegas as a culinary capital, and the onset of a struggle between two visions of its future. Will it specialize in a kind of ghost cuisine, conceived but seldom cooked by absentee chefs who made their names elsewhere, or will it nurture its own kitchen superstars?
 Steve Wynn, whose gigantic new $2.7 billion casino opened in the summer of 2005, helped put Las Vegas on the world's gastronomic map in 1998 when he lured luminaries like Julian Serrano, Alessandro Strata and Sirio Maccioni to the Mirage and Bellagio, the Las Vegas resorts he then owned. Mr. Serrano and Mr. Strata moved here, and their food profited from their daily attention. But many of the chefs and restaurateurs who followed in their profitable wake did little more than phone in menus.
 Mr. Wynn said that one evening in 2000 he ran into Jean-Georges Vongerichten at Prime, the Bellagio steakhouse that bears Mr. Vongerichten's imprimatur. Mr. Vongerichten, who is involved in restaurants in New York and around the world, told the casino boss that it was the first time he had cooked at Prime since it opened two years earlier.
 That set Mr. Wynn to thinking, he told me, and he decided that ''the only thing that matters is who's cooking dinner, not whose name appears on the door.'' As a result, most of the nine fine-dining restaurants at Wynn Las Vegas (among 22 food operations) are run by younger chefs, well known in the cities where they formerly cooked but not nationally celebrated. All have relocated to Las Vegas as a condition of employment, except Mr. Strata, who has moved over from the Mirage, and Daniel Boulud.
 ''A sense started spreading that something was fishy here,'' Mr. Wynn said. ''If Steve Wynn paints a painting he doesn't get to sign it Picasso. So we're going down a different path. It's a bit of adventure, and I admit I'm not sure it'll work.''
 Gamal Aziz, who ran Bellagio's food and beverage operation and who considers Mr. Wynn his mentor, thinks not. Now the president of MGM Grand, the Egyptian-born Mr. Aziz is still reaching for stars. He persuaded Mr. Robuchon to set up shop here, where the chef is contractually required to spend just two weeks a quarter.
 ''I think it's an uphill battle to bring in these relatively unknown chefs and introduce them,'' Mr. Aziz said. ''Most of our clients come to the desert for four or five days, not long enough to get used to new faces. They want to recognize names. I think we gain a competitive advantage by associating ourselves with the very best, and it will not be easy to top Joel Robuchon.''
 Well, Guy Savoy, another Paris heavyweight, holder of three Michelin stars, may come close if he wants to. His Las Vegas entry, on the second floor of the new Augustus Tower at Caesars Palace, a kitschfest even by Las Vegas standards, is set to open early in 2006; Mr. Savoy's son, Franck, has arrived to oversee it.
 Some equally big names have decided not even to pretend to reproduce the food they serve at their home bases. At Wynn, Mr. Boulud runs a brasserie, not a replica of Daniel, his brilliant Manhattan establishment (although the executive chef, Philippe Rispoli, who grew up near Lyon, like Mr. Boulud, makes a rough-textured pate de campagne, unctuous pork and goose rillettes and other dishes that would evoke cheers in New York). 
 Thomas Keller transplanted his bistro, Bouchon, not the French Laundry or Per Se, to the Venetian in Las Vegas. And the omnipresent Alain Ducasse, with two Michelin three-star restaurants, in Paris and Monte Carlo, eschews French classicism for a more populist approach at his local spot, Mix, perched on the 64th floor of a tower at Mandalay Bay. With sensational views across Sin City, it is much more endearing than its recently departed New York namesake. Thai beef salad and curried lobster cohabit happily on the menu with the best baba this side of the Atlantic, served with a choice of three premium rums. Hanging from the ceiling, thousands of shimmering Venetian glass baubles, said to have cost $500,000, remind you that you are in the world capital of wretched excess.
 ''Trying to replicate a Paris three-star on the 64th floor, maybe anywhere in Vegas, would have been a big mistake,'' said John Cunin, Mix's general manager.
 Obviously Mr. Aziz and Mr. Robuchon don't think so, and for now at least they seem to have brought it off. Mr. Robuchon took an almost obsessive interest in the design of the menu and the kitchen and put two seasoned Breton friends in day-to-day charge: Loic Launay as general manager, and Claude Le Tohic, who worked at Mr. Robuchon's side during the glory days at Jamin in Paris, as executive chef.
 Mr. Le Tohic holds the title of Meilleur Ouvrier de France (Best Craftsman of France), a coveted distinction awarded by a jury of his peers, so no one doubts his credentials. Seven cooks and six front-of-the-house people also came from Robuchon operations in Paris and Tokyo. Only time will tell, however, how long they will stay and who will replace them when they go.
 Two set menus are offered at Joel Robuchon at the Mansion, 9 small courses plus coffee for $165, and 16 small courses plus coffee for $295. Many items are also served a la carte. The 750-entry wine list includes risibly expensive items, presumably for those who have hit several jackpots, such as 1978 Le Montrachet from the Domaine de la Romanee-Conti at $8,845 a bottle. But for mere mortals, 2002 Puligny-Montrachet from Dujac at a modest $108 should more than suffice. It did so for me.
 Though relaxed, service is in the grand French style, with main courses delivered on silver trays (or carved at table side, in the case of the lobster and turbot and delectable roasted guinea hen with foie gras). Breads, cheeses (all French, all ripe), digestifs and after-dinner treats roll to the table on handsome wooden carts. The lighting is subtle, the air-conditioning far less overpowering than the Las Vegas norm; the tables are well spaced. Only 40 people can be seated in the square dining room, centered on a black fireplace with gas-fired flames, with room for a dozen more on a side terrace and 10 in a small private room.
 If the gelee amuse-bouche attested to Mr. Robuchon's unflagging creativity, a mille-feuille consisting of two triangular layer cakes of fresh king crab, Fuji apple, watercress and bibb lettuce with perfectly fitted tomato lids bespoke his artistry. They rested on a red disk formed by a coulis of tomato and Perigord verjus (unfermented juice of unripe grapes), delightful in its balance of acid and fruitiness, with minuscule green dots of parsley-infused mayonnaise around its circumference. So precisely was all this applied, each dish reportedly requiring 20 minutes to complete, that I thought for a second that it was part of the decoration of the plate. Magic.
 I could not resist trying langoustines, a Robuchon specialty, which are not often seen in the United States. Pulled into tight circles, enveloped in ephemeral ravioli cases with more than a few slivers of truffle, and cooked for only a few instants, these were meltingly sweet and ultratender. A hillock of barely steamed baby Savoy cabbage shared the plate, along with a slick of glossy veal reduction. Nothing else.
 The langoustines had been flown across the Atlantic, of course, but the milk-fed veal was all-American, from the highly regarded Four Story Hill Farm in Pennsylvania. Listed on the menu as a veal chop, it was in fact two rectangles, less than half an inch thick, judiciously cooked to a uniform pink from edge to edge and moistened with deeply flavored pan juices. This time the accompanying act was a nest of taglierini made from carrots, zucchini and broccolini and lightly sauced with pesto. Somebody somewhere may do a more succulent veal dish -- there are lots of restaurants in this world -- but if so I have never sampled it.
 Everything I ate was thought-out and free of frivolous gestures. Each combined delicacy with a certain muscularity of taste in a most unusual equilibrium. And each left my palate fresh as the dawn.
 THINGS have gotten off to a bumpy start at Wynn. Its nightclubs are already being revamped, its computer system has been plagued by bugs and one of its regional chefs, Jimmy Sneed, formerly at the Frog and the Redneck in Richmond, Va., left before the resort even opened, after personality clashes and a dispute over what style of food he should cook. 
 Some of the other restaurants still seem a little ragged, including Okada, where the gifted Takashi Yagahashi cooks European-influenced Japanese food.
 The look of the place is a bit of a letdown as well. Whereas Bellagio's lyrically swaying fountains evoke Busby Berkeley musicals, Wynn's ersatz Yosemite, waterfalls and all, comes straight out of B-movies.
 But Wynn has had its triumphs as well, including Alex, the new domain of Mr. Strata and his rich, layered Franco-Italian food, which is one of the town's handful of truly successful haute cuisine restaurants. Its two steakhouses are booming, too; Las Vegas has always loved beef.
 From my viewpoint, Paul Bartolotta's Ristorante di Mare is as thrilling as it is unexpected: an Italian seafood trattoria smack in the middle of the American desert. Although forewarned, I leapt with surprise when he wheeled out a trolley banked with bright-eyed orata, branzino, triglia (red mullet), spigola and other fish -- even ugly, fiery red scorfano, the rascasse so vital to bouillabaisse -- from Venice, Sicily, Liguria and other maritime parts of Italy, which come directly from a Milanese broker.
 Milwaukee-born, trained in top kitchens in New York, France and Italy, Mr. Bartolotta, 44, made Spiaggia in Chicago the best Italian restaurant between the coasts. When they met, Mr. Wynn said, ''I wanted a normal Italian menu -- you know, veal piccata -- but he insisted on doing something different and wore me down.''
 So seafood it is: steamed mussels with cannellini beans, tender octopus salad, linguine with clams and tomatoes, charcoal grilled lobster or langoustines and those beautiful fish, simply poached or roasted whole with olive oil and perhaps a touch of grapefruit for balance, dressed with herbs and some simple condiment like salsa salmoriglio (olive oil, lemon, garlic and oregano) -- real seaside stuff -- with a few token meat dishes like rabbit, chicken and rack of lamb. No veal piccata.
 ''I'm shooting for extreme simplicity and explosive flavor,'' Mr. Bartolotta said, and he is hitting those targets.
 Another veteran of the Chicago restaurant wars, Taiwan-born Richard Chen, who won acclaim at the Peninsula Hotel's Shanghai Terrace in Chicago, also seems to have hit his stride in Las Vegas. He cooks Western-inflected Chinese food at Wing Lei at Wynn, including a fabulous Peking duck salad that owes a debt to a similar dish at Hakkasan in London, a lobster spring roll, thinly sliced abalone with a spicy green papaya salad and a memorable Dungeness crab slow-cooked with ginger, scallions and garlic in a clay pot.
 All fine eating -- and a joy to look at as well, as is the miniature garden that lies just beyond a wall-size window, with a pair of 100-year old pomegranate trees and a big black Fernando Botero sculpture. 
 Still, the question remains: as important as dining has become to Las Vegas, where gambling now accounts for only 40 percent of revenues, can a rootless place with no indigenous gastronomic traditions and no local raw materials (except for the odd blood orange and sprig of rosemary) ever be a great restaurant town, as opposed to a resort town with good restaurants -- ''a Disneyland for foodies,'' as the restaurant consultant Clark Wolf calls it?
 ''I doubt that you will ever have a true food culture here, in the sense that Lyon and Venice and San Francisco have food cultures,'' commented Elizabeth Blau, executive vice president for restaurant development at Wynn Resorts, who is considered one of the savviest food people in the city. ''Nothing is local.''
 I asked Mr. Aziz whether Las Vegas is yet a great restaurant city.
 ''No, not yet,'' he replied, ''but we've made some quantum leaps. We've built a strong foundation, and eventually we'll get there. This is a large, prosperous region now. We have the economic means to support not only great restaurants in the casinos, but also the bistros and other places that are popping up in the neighborhoods.''

HEADLINE: The Fuel-Sipping Sedan That's the Hot Seller in China

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER

DATELINE: HANGZHOU, China 

 BODY:
DRIVE the streets of this prosperous city in central China today, and the cars look a lot like they did in big American cities a decade ago.
 There are many midsize cars and some compacts, bearing familiar brands like Volkswagen, Mercedes-Benz, Audi and Buick. Sport-utility vehicles are rare, as they were in the United States in the early 1990's, while pickup trucks are seen even less often than they were in places like New York City.
But this year, China has a new sales champion, a tiny car that would not fit in on United States roads and even looks a little out of place in China: the Charade. 
 Unlike the midsize Volkswagen Santana and the compact Volkswagen Jetta, the market leaders in China for many years, the Charade is a fuel-sipping subcompact. And unlike the Santana and Jetta, produced by Volkswagen-dominated joint ventures with Chinese companies, the Charade is manufactured by a Chinese-controlled company, First Auto Works.
 That makes it a good illustration for two of the three big trends expected to shape the Chinese market for many years: a shift toward more fuel efficiency and the rise of Chinese automakers as challengers to the multinationals.
 But the Charade, with an aging design licensed from Daihatsu, is less representative of the third important trend, an emphasis on showiness that borders on being tacky, apparent even in fairly small cars sold in China. It is an overt stylishness visible in the two compact models that are the second- and third-best selling cars in China this year, the Hyundai Elantra and the Buick Excelle.
 ''Currently, the Chinese taste is more extroverted than the European one, and there is no evidence that this will change in the coming years,'' said Stefan Fritschi, the head of design at Shanghai Volkswagen. Later, he added, ''Features which make a car obviously more 'rich' will stay on top of the wish list: blinking and beeping electronic equipment or a bright interior with voluptuous use of leather, chrome, aluminum and wood, even if these are not genuine.''
 That perception is shared by executives at the Ford Motor Company. ''In terms of pure Chinese tastes, what I see as I travel the country is an interest in more show, whether it's wood or chrome,'' said Keith Davey, the vice president for planning and business development at Ford China.
 With an emphasis on roomy interiors combined with good gas mileage, the Chinese market also seems to be moving toward some version of what is often called ''cab forward'' design in the United States. With such designs, the passenger compartment extends farther forward than usual, accounting for more of the vehicle's ''footprint'' -- its total length and width.
 ''In the context of high oil prices, we will certainly see cars with the same footprints but much better, efficient packages inside,'' said James Shyr, design director at General Motors' design and engineering center in Shanghai. ''The interior of the car will be top priority and a showcase rather than an afterthought.''
 Mr. Shyr said that Chinese customers were looking especially for vehicles with an aesthetically pleasing proportion between the size of the glassed-in part of the passenger compartment, known as the greenhouse area, and the lower part of the compartment, the area encompassed by the steel panels that form the doors.
 Other auto designers said that because many Chinese car buyers plan to ride in the back seat and hire someone else to drive -- including many who buy compact cars -- they would be attracted to sedans with thin vertical pillars between the front and rear doors. Designing cars with strong pillars by the windshield and the rear window, instead of a strong middle pillar, can improve the view for rear-seat passengers.
 But all these design changes for the Chinese market will take time. The most immediate change lies in the new popularity of small cars, a phenomenon that appears likely to continue.
 That shift partly reflects rising energy costs, as China has kept gasoline and diesel prices below $2 a gallon by forcing state-owned refineries to sell fuel at a loss. A more important factor is a clear decision by China's leaders to use their formidable influence over the country's economy to force the auto market toward greater conservation.
 ''The Chinese government is going to be pushing more and more fuel-efficient or alternative fuel solutions for vehicles,'' said Mr. Davey of Ford.
 Rapidly increasing oil imports and high world oil prices have alarmed China's leaders. Government officials are drafting new taxes that will fall much more heavily on vehicles with large engines. They have warned the Chinese public that they are considering stiff taxes on gasoline and diesel fuel once global prices start to fall.
 At the same time, government ministries have been financing extensive research into hybrid gasoline-electric vehicles and more ambitious hydrogen-fueled vehicles. Volkswagen announced in September that its first hybrid-engine vehicle anywhere in the world, a version of the Touran minivan, would be developed jointly with the Shanghai Automotive Industry Corporation and Tongji University in Shanghai.
 Sales of so-called micro cars, even smaller than subcompact models, rose 66 percent in the first eight months of this year, compared with last year, according to the China Automotive Report, a statistical service tracking the industry. By contrast, sales gains during the period were 10 percent for full-size sedans and 21 percent for minivans.
 Chinese brands are also gaining market share, now accounting for 26 percent of the market. Chinese automakers are already making their first tentative forays into Europe, and looking at the American market as well. Chinese executives have expressed interest in exporting not just the sort of tiny cars that allowed Japanese and Korean automakers to gain footholds, but larger and more luxurious models as well.
 But industry experts say that may be a leap too far, and that no one should expect to see Chinese sedans with narrow middle pillars on American roads any time soon.
 ''Left to their own devices, they'd love to come in at the high end and build Mercedes-Benz equivalents,'' said Michael Dunne, the president of Automotive Resources Asia, which publishes the China Automotive Report. ''I don't think they're there in terms of the quality, the emissions or the safety.''

HEADLINE: Ideas for Making It Easier to Walk Away From an Accident

BYLINE: By ERIC NAGOURNEY

 BODY:
HOW could cars be safer? Five experts with different experiences and points of view were asked their thoughts on the subject.

BRUCE BELZOWSKI
 Assistant research scientist, the University of Michigan's Office for the Study of Automotive Transportation
 Do I have to meet federal miles-per-gallon standards? Because if I can get one mile per gallon, I can make a tank. If you get in a crash, you want to win the crash.
Of course, you also have to have side air bags as well as front air bags. Side crashes are just so deadly. You just don't have much metal.
 You want the new design of headrests. And, obviously, you want safety glass all the way around. You want the roof of the vehicle to be reinforced. You want windows that will open even if the power goes out, in case your car goes into the water. Power windows often don't work then. That to me is kind of a convenience that has intruded on safety. Roll-down windows actually are safer. 
 It would be good to have adaptive cruise control. You can set the distance between you and the car in front of you. There's also technology out there that will lock you in a lane, and you only have to drive. There's also something that has not made it through the government, but is available: pressure-sensitive brake lights. The harder you press the brake, the brighter the light.
 The other thing is the lighting up front. You've seen them now, cornering lights. As you turn the wheel, the lights turn with you. And having headlights on all the time is what you've really got to do. 

ADRIAN K. LUND
 Chief operating officer, the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety
 Obviously, vehicles already have front air bags, which can protect you in very high severity crashes. But they should have side air bags, too. We think every vehicle should have electronic stability control. It is also important that the vehicle be conspicuous. It should have daytime running lights. It would be nice if we had alcohol sensors in cars. Right now, they're cumbersome and clunky. There's new technology that can read alcohol levels by shining a light through your skin. It would be useful if there were a way to somehow deactivate cars when someone has been drinking too much.
 Heavier cars tend to protect you better, but it's also important how the car absorbs the energy from a crash, so that your body does not hit something at full speed. So it needs good crush zones.
 If we didn't have to be able to sell the vehicle, if you really wanted to make a safe vehicle, you would probably make it big and slow and ugly. If you get in a crash, it's big enough to protect you, it's slow enough so you're not going so fast to begin with, and if it's ugly you probably won't be driving it as much. But that doesn't sell, so we have to come up with practical things.

RICK SEAMAN
 Stunt driver, head instructor for the Motion Picture Driving Clinic
 One of the most important things is that the seat be designed to absorb impact. I've done a lot of jumps, and most seats are bad. If I am asked to do a jump and there's no time to purchase and mount a good seat, I just take a knife, cut a hole in the seat and pull out the metal, like seat adjustment motors. I'll just take my own layer of foam and lay it in there, and also an inner tube.
 Normal people don't go around jumping cars, but I would be surprised if a lot of people that flip cars over don't incur tailbone or spine injuries because of the seats. My recommendation is that anything that could be done to get hard objects away from the tailbone area would be beneficial. If you put your hand under the seat, you go, ''Oh my God, look what I'm sitting on top of.''
 A lot of accidents are rear-ends. I live out here in Los Angeles. I see cars stacked up six or seven deep, where there's about five feet between them in the fast lane. And I go, God, these people have no clue. Why can't we have a sensor that, when you get so close to the guy in front of you at certain speeds, that it levels off your throttle?

CLARENCE DITLOW
 Executive director, the Center for Auto Safety
 You should have state-of-the-art technology in every vehicle, not just those that cost more money. There are 10,000 deaths in rollover crashes today.
 Some vehicles have electronic stability controls that will reduce the chance of a rollover. You're never going to eliminate all crashes, so strong roofs are necessary. But you should have safety in economy cars as well as safety in luxury cars. It should be a fundamental right of all vehicle occupants to have the same levels of safety built in.
 Still, even the best safety equipment will not do much to protect you in some crashes. If you're hit by an 18-wheeler, there are not a lot of vehicles out there today that would let you walk away. So it would be nice to have a highway system that separated passenger vehicles from commercial ones. 

PAUL GREEN
 Senior research scientist, the University of Michigan's Transportation Research Institute
 People have talked about replacing the steering wheel with a joystick to eliminate steering-wheel-crash injuries. But it turns out that a steering wheel is a very good device from a control perspective. Also, you can hold it in more than one place, so it gets rid of fatigue problems.
 A common misperception is that the safest vehicle would be armored. What makes a lot of vehicles safe is that they crush in a predictable manner, absorbing the crash energy instead of transmitting it to the driver. However, in terms of structure, the major problem right now is the side is relatively weak. There should be side impact curtains in every vehicle.
 In terms of passive safety, that is, seat belts, air bags and structural changes, we are reaching the limit of what we can do. So we have to start thinking about active safety, trying to sense the environment and the driver. We need to think about cars that can sense when there's going to be a crash, and do things to reduce the force of the crash. This could include setting off the air bag before the actual impact. Other devices can monitor the performance of the driver and sense if he or she is not paying attention, and alter when and how safety systems operate.

HEADLINE: The Comeback Cars in Europe, Where Little Is Big 

BYLINE: By BRADEN PHILLIPS

 BODY:
SITTING in one of Europe's latest generation of tiny cars is like entering a New York City studio apartment. You gawk at how so much can be done with so little space.
 These Lilliputians of the road have been around Europe for decades, designed to deal with traditionally high gas prices and the medieval scale of many of its cities. The current crop of minicars, however, is a far cry from Italy's Fiat 600 from the 1950's, when that car offered all the sturdiness of a June bug.
''When we had small cars, people dreamed of bigger cars,'' said Michel Barge, Peugeot's product director for small cars. ''Today, the small car is the comeback car. It's better in terms of equipment, safety, innovation and comfort.''
 Buyers in Europe have about 14 models to choose from this year, which are shorter than 138 inches (11.5 feet), the smallest of the small, known as segment A, or the urban car. That's five more than last year. 
 Automotive analysts say the resurgence of the minicar market in Europe is a result of rising gas prices, worsening congestion and slow economic growth. 
 In America, half the vehicles on the road are vans, sport-utility vehicles and light trucks, while small cars represent only around 13 percent of the market. In Europe, segment A alone makes up 6.6 percent. If segment B is included, about the size of a Ford Fiesta, the percentage balloons to more than 35 percent.
 In the mid-90's, carmakers in Europe introduced a variety of little models, but profit margins were so low they balked at revamping production. But once Asian producers like the Korean-based Kia made inroads, European companies and their American branches revisited this niche.
 While the newest generation of urban cars may still be entry-level transportation for some buyers, their features -- power windows, air-conditioning, sunroofs, satellite navigation and antilock brakes -- defined the luxury class not long ago. 
 Manufacturers are not only delivering little cars with big-car comfort and safety, but they are also doing so at an average price of around $10,000. Moreover, they get excellent gas mileage, in some cases as high as 40 to 50 miles a gallon. 
 To pull it off, companies have formed partnerships and set up production where labor costs less. The biggest example is the PSA Peugeot-Citroen-Toyota alliance. This year, a plant in the Czech Republic began producing 300,000 units to be divided equally among the three companies, all using the same platform. Each company provides its own look, marketing strategy and price. 
 Here are profiles of four of the best-selling minicars in Europe. Some are indeed small, but do not fit into the category of the smallest cars. 

Fiat Panda
 Italians have long been leading small-car producers and buyers, and the Panda was the category's biggest seller in Europe last year. 
 The first Panda was introduced in 1978 to replace the iconic 500, which followed the 600. The 600 retired two years ago, after selling more than five million units; the latest version is different in all respects except for the name. 
 Made in Poland, where Fiat has long had production plants, this edition has earned praise for its comfort and quality, with a roof rack and sportiness that appeals to drivers who are attracted to a more masculine aesthetic. 
 ''The Panda is all about Italian design simplicity -- it's one of those cars you can do anything to and it always looks right,'' said Richard Gadeselli, a company spokesman. ''If you add features to some cars, they look like a woman wearing too much makeup. With this car, you add it on, and it still looks cool.''
 As an indication of the trend toward small-car luxury, 52 percent of the Pandas that are sold include add-on features; only 22 percent are base models.

Kia Picanto
 Introduced in the spring of 2004, the Picanto has struck a chord with the European public, especially young women.
 ''We use colorful fabrics in the interior -- red, orange and blue -- that we only use in Europe,'' said Jean-Charles Lievens, Kia Europe's senior vice president. ''You have to be trendy, close to what's happening in young people's lives. They like things that are different, things that are emotional.'' 
 Kia has marketed its car as if it were a fashion accessory.
 ''It's a funny, nice car -- the girls think it's cute,'' said Joaquin Garcia, an automotive designer for Fuore Design, a Barcelona firm that has worked on various cars but not the Kia. 
 Kia's success has charged up other European carmakers. ''The Picanto demonstrates that we have to take Korean cars very seriously,'' Mr. Garcia said. ''They are staying cheap and getting better.''
 Although the profit on the Picanto is marginal, Kia regards it as a way to build brand loyalty. ''We're looking for repeat sales when customers step up to the next size-class,'' he said. ''You have to think globally.''

Chevrolet Matiz
 Originally made by Daewoo, the Matiz is now a Chevrolet product, which came out with its latest version earlier this year. First sold in 1998, the car's revamped look -- 80 percent of its parts are new -- is timed to coincide with the increasing interest in the small-car segment. 
 ''You have to change the car more often the more that the competition increases,'' said James N. Hall, an industry analyst with AutoPacific Group. ''The VW Beetle could stay the same as long as it did because it had little competition.'' 
 Designers said that the Matiz was trying to appeal to both sporty and family-oriented buyers. The exterior is more contemporary, with distinctive geometrically shaped headlights, while the interior's big change is the instrument panel, which was moved to the middle from the driver's side. With information like fuel, speed and r.p.m.'s so visible, designers said, central panels reflect a more family orientation. 
 The car has sold well. 
 ''I don't foresee any major changes to the life circumstances for our European customers,'' said Patricia Messar, marketing director for Chevrolet Europe. ''Smaller, affordable, good-looking and practical cars are the key.''

Renault Twingo
 When it came out in 1992, the Twingo was the first supermini, with a cleverly designed interior that could double as a minivan with the seats folded down. 
 But the Twingo's look has grown stale, designers say, perceived by young people as a car better suited to their parents. Although it is still selling fairly well, especially in France, Renault thinks that after 13 years it is time for something new. 
 ''We didn't think the car would last so long -- it was a surprise to us,'' said Clement Peltier, a Renault spokesman.
 The company will replace the Twingo in 2007 with a version that it hopes will have the draw of the original. ''We had to realize that the Twingo was selling well to older people,'' Mr. Peltier said. ''The target buyer of the new Twingo will be what we originally thought -- young, urban and without children.''

Smart
 At just over eight feet long, this is the Tom Thumb of cars. Introduced in 1998 by what was then Daimler-Benz and Swatch, the Swiss watchmaker, the Smart has won kudos for its engineering but never enough buyers to meet development costs, including a dealer network. 
 For now, DaimlerChrysler A.G. has restructured the Smart division to avoid curtailing it entirely. Among other measures, Smart will end its jazzy roadster line this year and focus on its basic for two, which will have a new model in 2007, and the four-seater brought out in April 2004. 
 The Smart makes less look like more. The two seats are not aligned shoulder to shoulder, creating an illusion of more space. Another technique is making the dashboard more shelflike, with controls on top. The price of gas and other market trends are encouraging for the Smart's future. As to its entry into the American market, DaimlerChrysler said it would decide by this year. 
 ''We will be entering the U.S. market on condition that we can be profitable with the Smart for two,'' said Bettina Singhartinger, a company spokeswoman.

HEADLINE: Making a Parking Garage Look Nicer Than a Parking Garage

BYLINE: By KEITH SCHNEIDER

DATELINE: TRAVERSE CITY, Mich. 

 BODY:
THREE years ago, elected leaders here won a tough public fight to replace acres of surface parking with a distinctive parking deck designed to blend into this handsome lake city's thriving downtown. 
 They never anticipated that the architect would do such a good job that people driving into Traverse City regularly missed the new $9 million four-level deck entirely, mistaking its dark brick facade, big windowlike openings and first-floor retail spaces for a new office building. That problem was solved the old-fashioned way: by hanging white and blue banners on city street lights, urging visitors to ''hit the deck.''
''It's kind of a balancing act,'' said Bryan Crough, the executive director of the Traverse City Downtown Development Authority, a city government agency that oversees the two-year-old parking deck, which was named for a former city commissioner. ''We didn't want it to stand out, but we still need people to know it's there.'' 
 Indeed, the 540-space Larry C. Hardy Parking Deck represents a new value -- handsome architectural design -- added to the lengthy list of utilitarian considerations, like size, lighting, ease of access, safety, durability, efficiency and cost, which have long guided parking deck construction in America. So many cities, universities, hospitals, airports, train stations, corporate parks and housing developments are building upscale parking decks, that they now represent a mainstream movement in civic design. 
 Dale F. Denda, the research director at PMRC, a parking market and operations research firm in McLean, Va., said that 355 parking decks were built across the country last year. Those decks had an average of 860 spaces, at a cost of $12,000 a space. Do the math, and parking decks added about 305,000 new spaces in America. Builders spent $4.2 billion to put them up. A third to a half of all new decks were designed to blend in, at $1,000 to $2,000 a space more than a conventional unadorned parking deck. 
 Much has changed since the first self-park deck was built in Detroit in the 1930's. Inside modern decks, ceilings are higher, lights are brighter, colors are more soothing; and traffic engineers have made driving in and out easier, faster and safer. But the most visible changes have come on the outside, Mr. Denda said, because builders are now asking architects to help them make parking decks more compatible with their community. 
 ''People are much more sensitive to how these decks look than they used to be, and there's a reason for that,'' Mr. Denda said. ''In a lot of cases, the parking deck dwarfs the buildings that generate the traffic. Take a 150,000-square-foot office building. The typical parking ratio is three spaces per thousand. You're talking about a garage that is as large as the office building. So builders and architects are trying to reduce the mass from an architectural standpoint. They use architectural treatments to seemingly scale down the garage, hide it, make it fit in.''
 Architects use two principal design tools to accomplish this. The first is updating the exteriors with facades of brick and molded concrete, installing aluminum screens and other window treatments, incorporating plantings and, in some cases, limiting the structure's size. The second trick is to try to hide the deck behind other buildings.
 In combination, the effect can be striking. For example, Princeton, N.J., built a 500-space parking deck that is almost indistinguishable from a new public library, new housing and a retail, restaurant and office complex under development downtown. The project also includes a new public park.
 In Boca Raton, Fla., MBNA America, the big credit card company about to become a subsidiary of the Bank of America, built a 499-space parking deck in the late 1990's as part of its new Southern regional headquarters. The deck incorporates a tile parapet wall along the entire roof of the building, aluminum grillwork on the windows and a white decor that makes it look like a corporate office building. 
 One of the best examples of parking structure design and construction was completed along the Christina River in Wilmington in 2003, where the Delaware Department of Transportation built a two-level 422-space deck with grapevine joints, cast-stone keystones, flame-finish granite, cornices, column caps and Victorian scrollwork grilles. The design and flourishes of the Riverfront Parking Deck pay homage to the Philadelphia architect Frank Furness, who designed three buildings in the city's Train Station District. 
 The $8.5 million parking deck, designed by John Hynes, a Wilmington architect with Tevebaugh Associates, also serves the Amtrak station, built on a 20-foot viaduct and one of the busiest railroad stations in the country. But the deck is low enough for passengers and those waiting for trains to see the new landscaped riverside park, which Wilmington now regards as its gateway. 
 ''The state spent a lot of extra money for that facade because they wanted the aesthetics to match the nearby train station and the park next to the river,'' said E. James Ebert, executive vice president of Tim Haahs & Associates, an architectural and engineering firm in Blue Bell, Pa., and in Miramar, Fla., near Miami, that specializes in parking decks, and helped design the Wilmington deck. ''Builders want the nice architectural finishes.''
 The flourishes and extra costs of high-minded parking decks, however, are not always appreciated. Almost two years ago, when Waynesville, N.C., opened its $4 million, 376-space deck downtown, residents were unimpressed. The five-level structure, which leaders said would not look like a parking garage, looked exactly like that. ''Masking the bottom seven feet of the front of a five-level parking deck with a strip of stonework won't change the way it looks from a distance or the way it looks when approaching it by vehicle from the side,'' wrote Becky Johnson, a writer for The Smoky Mountain News.
 Traverse City's deck, however, is a hit. It is among the tallest buildings in this city of 14,500. The entrances are embellished by ironwork, and the stairways and elevators are housed in a lighthouse-style tower with huge glass windows. The first floor on State Street houses offices, Bart's Texas-Style BBQ restaurant, and is across from the Park Place Hotel, the city's oldest and grandest. 
 At about $15,000 a space, the Larry C. Hardy deck represents an investment that is nearly double that for an unadorned concrete parking deck. But city figures show it is generating higher-than-expected parking revenue; 18,000 vehicles used the deck in July, the city said. It has proved to be such an asset that there has been no argument about building a second deck on the city's west side. 
 ''Our plan for downtown is to make it more walkable, more dense,'' Mr. Crough said. ''We want to make it look and feel much more like downtown did in the 1930's and 1940's. Taking cars off the surface lots and putting them in great looking parking decks helps.''

HEADLINE: After the Loss of Some Shirts, Lenders Are Leasing Again

BYLINE: By BERNARD STAMLER

 BODY:
WITH employee discount programs hogging the spotlight, vehicle leasing has not garnered much attention lately. But only a few years after steep losses slowed the practice, leasing is making a comeback.
 The trend is clear, said Art Spinella, president of CNW Marketing Research, an automotive consulting company in Bandon, Ore. Some 3.6 million vehicles will be leased this year in the United States, representing 21 percent of total domestic sales, he said. That is up from 20 percent last year, and 18.7 percent in 2002, a low point for leasing.
It is still a far cry from the heady days of 1999, when leased cars, sport-utility vehicles and light trucks accounted for more than a third of the domestic vehicle market. The finance arms of automakers, known as captives, and banks offered ''all kinds of deals'' to get leasing business, Mr. Spinella said. 
 That, in turn, was the culmination of a process that first began in the early 90's, said Randall McCathren, president of BLC Associates, a consulting firm in Nashville. Facing a precipitous drop in sales because of the 1990-91 recession, vehicle manufacturers ''were desperate to get them going again,'' Mr. McCathren said. And leasing, which had been aimed primarily at high-end business customers, became the solution. 
 Why? Low monthly payments attract customers, the companies reasoned. And monthly lease payments are lower than traditional car loan payments because the customer who is leasing is financing the difference only between the car's value at the start of a lease and its estimated value at the end, known as the residual. 
 Therefore, leasing customers can often afford more expensive cars, especially when interest rates are relatively high, as they were through much of the 90's. Because leases generally last only two or three years, lessees return for new cars more often than those with five- or six-year loans. That benefits customers and dealers, too.
 So the finance units of the automakers began doing a lot of leasing. The strategy worked, and banks and other finance companies, which were losing car loan business, soon jumped into the fray. Competition intensified and financing became more aggressive -- ''far too aggressive,'' said Paul Ballew, executive director of market and industry analysis for the General Motors Acceptance Corporation, G.M.'s finance unit.
 Many gimmicks were used to lower lease payments. Lenders often subsidized interest rates. Lease terms were shortened, with mileage limitations and other fine-print conditions imposed. Most important, residuals were pumped up to reduce the amount of the lease principal. This was especially true in the case of S.U.V.'s, which were becoming wildly popular in the 90's. 
 It was not a good idea. Inflating residual values might have seemed like a low-risk idea during the mid- to late 90's, when used-car sales were robust. By the early 2000's, however, formerly leased cars and S.U.V.'s began flooding the used-car market, just as sluggish new-car sales prompted carmakers to offer discounts. Soon, used-vehicle values were falling far below residuals, and lenders were losing their shirts. 
 As a result, the leasing industry lost $10 billion in 2001, Mr. Spinella said.
 Not surprisingly, that caused many banks to swear off leasing. As interest rates declined, no-interest loans and hefty rebates enticed consumers to buy once again. Buy they did -- including consumers who had become disenchanted with leasing because of penalties incurred when they turned in cars.
 But leasing remained popular among some luxury-car customers, primarily for tax reasons. For example, 40 to 50 percent of Mercedes-Benz vehicles are leased, a figure that has not changed appreciably in the last decade, said Jurgen Rochert, vice president of the Mercedes-Benz Credit Corporation. The numbers are about the same for BMW, said Bob Devine, president of BMW Financial Services in the United States.
 Now, for several reasons, leasing has become popular again. Predictions of residual values have become more reliable, said Gary Tucker, senior vice president for financial services and insurance at J.D. Power & Associates. Over the last few years, used-car prices have stablilized, except for a recent drop resulting from the extension of employee discount programs on new cars to all customers. 
 Interest rates, meanwhile, have been rising, meaning that loans cost more and average car loan terms are lengthening.
 ''More than 30 percent of car loans are now 72 months or longer,'' Mr. Tucker said. ''For many consumers, that makes leasing an attractive alternative way to a lower monthly payment.''
 Auto manufacturers are also changing the way they price cars. ''Dealers used to have enough margin in a car and cash incentives to cover it,'' Mr. Tucker said, referring to the amounts needed for a down payment or to pay off a consumer's old car loan. ''But their ability to do this is now reduced.''
 With lease financing, on the other hand, the automakers' finance units are often willing to lend more in relation to a vehicle's sticker price, he said, making it easier to close the transaction. That is because they want to promote a relatively new phenomenon: the certified pre-owned car.
 Popularized by Lexus, Toyota's luxury brand, the certified used-car concept is fairly simple: when lessees return cars, they are cleaned, inspected and, if they are in decent shape, sold with a manufacturer's warranty. They command a premium over uncertified used cars and can be quite profitable, said Mr. Spinella of CNW Marketing Research. And sales are good.
 For example, Lexus sold more than 31,000 certified used cars through August of this year, a rise of about 10 percent from last year's pace, said Kerry Rivera, a company spokeswoman. For the corresponding period, BMW sold 49,620 certified pre-owned cars, said a spokeswoman, Martha McKinley, which represented a 3 percent increase.
 Dealers today are happy to lease to customers, or to sell new or used cars to them -- ''whatever the customer wants,'' said Ted Linhart, chairman of the Dominion Auto Group, which owns several dealerships in the Richmond, Va., area.
 Dominion is compensated by the carmaker the same way, regardless of how a car is financed, he said. Sure, a leasing customer may come back more often. The main thing, however, is moving the cars.
 ''It's really simple,'' he said. ''We present all the alternatives to the customer to get them the payment they want. And then we let them decide.''

HEADLINE: Car Manual vs. Repairman: Who Knows Best?

BYLINE: By ERIC A. TAUB

 BODY:
RUSNAK-WESTLAKE, an Audi dealership in Thousand Oaks, Calif., prides itself on strictly adhering to the maintenance practices and service intervals recommended by Audi of America. Except when it comes to tire pressure.
 When customers retrieve their cars from Rusnak, they find that their vehicle's tires have been inflated six to eight pounds more than the car manual recommendations. ''Harder tires wear better and give better performance,'' said Frank Burns, the dealership service manager.
Although most likely harmless, that practice sends automakers into a tizzy. Service practices listed in the manual have been researched to give cars their best performance and longest life. But one problem is that manuals are becoming the size of phone books as manufacturers try to address every ownership issue to avoid being sued. 
 Yet dealers improvise. As a result, many consumers don't know whether to trust the manual or the mechanic. While independent mechanics may disagree, manufacturers and industry experts generally think that following the manufacturer's guidelines closely is the best way to maintain a vehicle. 
 ''The first call is to believe the manual,'' said Paul A. Eisenstein, editor in chief of TheCarConnection.com, an automotive news Web site. ''But reading the manual is not just reading the chart in the back. The subtleties lie within its pages.''
 While oil-change shops argue otherwise, few vehicles fall into the ''severe service'' category, which means more frequent maintenance intervals, said Csaba Csere, the editor of Car and Driver magazine.
 ''It's nonsense to say that severe service is city driving, or driving on one dirt road every six months,'' Mr. Csere said. ''Everyone comes up with reasons for extra service, and most are totally unnecessary.''
 But Darrell Amberson, president of the Lehman's Garage chain in the Minneapolis area, said that severe driving was the norm. ''A salesman with a lot of highway driving is doing ideal driving,'' he said. ''Just about everybody else is a severe driver.''
 Mr. Csere said it was best to trust the manual. Unfortunately, even those who read the manual often run into contradictory or unclear advice.
 Some of the most perplexing maintenance practices include:

WHEN TO CHANGE THE OIL -- Changing the oil every 3,000 miles, as many quick-lube chains recommend, is usually a waste of money and oil. And cars that use synthetic oils can go much farther without a change.
 While it is true that severe driving requires more frequent oil changes, there is no consensus on what constitutes severe driving. ''Extreme driving is starting the car, driving 10 miles at low speeds, and then shutting it off,'' said Don Sherman, technical editor for Automobile magazine.
 ''Then why do engines that only receive 15,000-mile oil changes all seize up?'' asked Rene Gauch, the owner of the German Independent garage in Los Angeles. Mr. Gauch recommends a 7,000-mile change interval with synthetic oil, and a 3,000- to 5,000-mile interval for those who use regular oil.
 Mr. Eisenstein of TheCarConnection.com added, ''Oil is the one place where you can err on the side of caution.''

PROPER TIRE INFLATION -- Few drivers keep their tires inflated to the right pressure, which manufacturers stress is the amount that they have determined based on the tire and the weight of the car. The ''maximum tire pressure'' embossed on the sidewalls can be more than 20 pounds higher than the pressure that should actually be used.
 Proper inflation pressures are listed in the manual as well as on a sticker usually located in one of the door sills. 
 Beginning this model year, the manual is the only place to find the right tire pressure for driving in an empty vehicle; the door sticker now only lists the proper pressure for a full load. 

PROPER GAS GRADE -- With current gas prices, many people might be tempted to use a lower grade than the manufacturer recommends. In most cases, that is fine.
 The fuel requirement listed next to the gas cap ''is the worst-case scenario,'' said Marc Trahan, director of product quality and technical services for Audi of America. Many modern cars have antiknock sensors, which protect the engine from damage when gas with a lower octane rating is used. 
 General Motors prefers to have customers follow the manual's advice because many people will not know if their car has antiknock technology, said Peter Lord, the company's executive director for service operations in North America.
 For cars requiring higher-octane fuel, ''I'd stay away from low octane,'' said Mr. Gauch, the mechanic. Though he agreed that an antiknock sensor could adjust the engine, ''the electronics could go crazy'' as the engine tried to compensate.

HEADLINE: Tough Tests, Big Bumps: How Britain Cut Its Fatality Rate 

BYLINE: By HEATHER TIMMONS

DATELINE: LONDON 

 BODY:
FORCE another car to slow down while you're taking your road test, even if you are not in danger of causing an accident, and you fail. Get caught going over the speed limit more than three times and your license could be suspended. Drive after drinking, and you won't be allowed behind the wheel for a year. And forget about driving crosstown quickly. 
 Britain has developed some of the strictest road rules in the world. In return, it enjoys the world's lowest driving fatality rates, says the World Health Organization. 
Fatalities related to traffic accidents have more than halved in Britain since their peak in the mid-1960's, even as the number of licensed vehicles increased nearly threefold. In response to a jump in traffic fatalities in the late 50's and early 60's, the transportation minister, Barbara Castle, introduced 70 miles-an-hour highway speed limits, breathalyzer tests for suspected drunken drivers and compulsory seat belts in new cars. 
 According to the most recent World Health Organization numbers, the rate of fatal traffic accidents in Britain is 5.6 people every 100,000 people, a substantial difference from the United States, where the rate is 15. Measured another way, there are 7.6 fatalities per billion kilometers driven in Britain, compared with 9.4 in the United States, according to figures compiled by the International Road and Traffic Accident Database, a research venture of the European Union. The W.H.O. estimates that traffic injuries cost Britain 0.5 percent of the gross domestic product, versus 2.3 percent in the United States, which is on par with Uganda. 
 Britain's success can be attributed to the combination of a blisteringly tough driving test, strict enforcement, chilling ad campaigns and speed bumps in roads. The government also continues to set ambitious targets: Prime Minister Tony Blair recently called for cutting crashes and injuries by 40 percent by 2010. 
 A former Ministry of Defense site outside the town of Bedford, in southern England, houses the Driving Standards Agency. The site trains, tests and monitors thousands of driving-test examiners to a painstaking level of exactitude. 
 Test failure rates are remarkably high for would-be drivers in Britain: just 42 percent of test-takers pass (compared with about 61 percent, for example, in New York State), down from 50 percent in 1950. That's with help -- an estimated 98 percent of British drivers take lessons, with most taking 20 or more, besides driving with family and friends. 
 The test elements are similar to many in the United States: three-point turns, pulling into intersections, parking. But examiners are looking for evidence that drivers are cautious and vividly aware of everything around them. Drivers could get a ''serious fault,'' which means they have failed the test, for example, if they don't register that there is something in the road ahead with a tap on the brakes. 
 Passing the driving test is such a watershed event that the process has been turned into a reality television show. Each episode of the show, the BBC's ''Mirror, Signal, Manoeuvre,'' which is on its second season, follows two test-takers through the ordeal. Last year its ratings beat Jerry Springer's new British show. 
 ''We see the driving test as a lifetime skill -- get it wrong and you'll die,'' said Barry Morris, the chief driving examiner for the Driving Standards Agency. Mr. Morris suggests that most drivers take 50 lessons or more before they come in for an examination. Even drivers who have passed are on two-year probation. 
 Another contributing factor to Britain's low accident rate is ''traffic calming,'' making it more difficult to drive fast. For example, London and other major cities are rife with speed bumps that can be the size of a small sand dune, also known as ''sleeping policemen,'' on side streets where traffic is light. 
 ''Drivers don't like them, because they don't want to slow down, but they are extremely effective,'' said Kevin Clinton, head of road safety at the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents, a British charity that works closely with the government on traffic issues. ''Local residents are clamoring to have them on their streets,'' he said. 
 Government-sponsored advertising campaigns also have teeth. Since the 1960's, Britain's transportation department has been promoting the values of safe driving, slow speeds and avoiding alcohol. They are rarely fuzzy public service announcements, though. 
 One radio spot in a recent campaign about the merits of following the speed limits in school zones culminates in screeching car tires and a ''thump,'' then the voice of a little girl saying: ''At 30, there's an 80 percent chance I'll live. At 35 there's an 85 percent chance I'll die.'' 
 Drinking while driving is much less common in Britain than in the United States, even though people drink at a much younger age and generally drink more at one sitting. The difference is that public transportation in the most populated areas of Britain is good, and penalties for being caught are stiff, even if you don't cause an accident. 
 The official limit for driving while intoxicated in Britain is 0.08 percent, as in much of the United States, but the lightest penalty for a first-time offender is removal of one's license for a year. After two offenses, a driver will need to take a test again before being able to drive. Rather than warning drivers to know their limits, the government suggests they don't drink at all.
 To keep speeds down on highways, Britain has embraced the hidden camera, which takes shots of cars going over the limit and transmits the image to the local police, who issue a ticket based on license-plate numbers. Getting four speeding tickets in three years, even at a mile over the speed limit, will result in a suspended license. 
 The speed cameras are highly unpopular with many drivers, but the government plans to install more. 
 Then there is the matter of personality. Some of Britain's success at keeping traffic accidents low can be related to ''British reserve and temperament,'' said Nigel Bartram, underwriting manager for Norwich Union, an insurance company. ''Perhaps we're a little more laid-back,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Both Promise And Problems For New Tigers In Your Tank

BYLINE: BY MATTHEW L. WALD

DATELINE: OTTAWA 

 BODY:
TO fill the tank in his Chrysler Sebring LX, Jeff Passmore drives to the back of his factory, past the flatbed trailer stacked with next week's 1,000-pound bales of straw and up to the pump that dispenses what last week's straw has become: ethanol.
 Gasoline here has pushed past $1.25 (Canadian) a liter, roughly $3 a gallon prevailing in the United States, but for people like Mr. Passmore, executive vice president of the Iogen Corporation, that is good news because the price of straw is not changing much. With a few kinks to work out, the ethanol could be produced at about $1.08 (U.S.) a gallon, company officials say.
As gasoline prices rise, alternatives become more attractive, including some you might not have heard of. But any challenger to gasoline faces hurdles in manufacturing and logistics. It must cost about what gasoline costs, and that price must include getting the new fuel to the pump by integrating it with the existing gasoline delivery system. 
 Ethanol like Iogen's is a leading contender because it can meet both criteria. Its technical name is cellulosic ethanol because the feedstock is cellulose, the woody material that makes up a plant's stem and stalk. Grass and other agricultural wastes work too.
 The secret ingredient?
 ''Jungle rot,'' Mr. Passmore said. More formally, Iogen is using Trichoderma reesei, a fungus that company officials say was discovered by American soldiers on Guam in World War II. ''They couldn't figure out why their canvas tents were dissolving,'' Mr. Passmore said. Now, with some genetic modifications that Iogen refers to as ''directed evolution,'' T. reesei is producing abnormally large amounts of the enzyme that breaks down cellulose into sugar. The next stage, turning sugar into alcohol, may be one of the oldest industrial activities.
 Big things are happening in jungle rot these days. The same is true of synthetic diesel, another alternative fuel that would not require a new distribution system. A Denver company, Rentech Inc., says it will break ground next year on a factory that will make 33,000 barrels a day of diesel fuel from coal, using a technology called Fischer-Tropsch, known as F-T, developed in Germany in 1923. Royal Dutch/Shell Group, a partner in Iogen, is also investing heavily in a plant in Qatar that also uses F-T to turn natural gas into diesel fuel. Others are using a different substitute for diesel, leftover vegetable oil from restaurant deep-fryers.
 Any alternative fuel must fit into the existing system of vehicles and fuels because oil, even if it is declining, isn't going away soon. ''It's taken a century to get the cost out of pulling oil out of the desert half a world away, transporting it here and refining it and delivering it to gas stations,'' said David K. Garman, the under secretary of the Energy Department, in an interview. ''That's a tough competitor.'' And any fuel that carries so much energy in so small a package, that can be dispensed as a liquid at room temperature, has major advantages.
 Still, given prices at the pump, he said, ''We need options, and we don't have them today.'' He predicted that cellulosic ethanol would play a role, but added that it was hard to project a production price. Both cellulosic ethanol and F-T require big investments before the first gallon is produced.
 ''A huge capital investment may make perfect sense,'' Mr. Garman said, ''if gasoline is going to stay at $3 a gallon.'' At that price, he said, F-T diesel was promising. 
 At a former Air Canada hangar on the edge of the Ottawa airport, Iogen operates what it says is the world's first demonstration cellulosic ethanol plant. It hopes by the end of the year to announce plans for a commercial plant, but for now it is shopping for tax breaks.
 Straw looks a lot like hay, but has fewer nutrients and therefore less value. A ton of baled straw goes for about $40 and yields 80 to 85 gallons of ethanol, making the price of the main raw material about 50 cents a gallon. By contrast, with oil at $70 for a 42-gallon barrel, the raw material for gasoline is about $1.67 a gallon. Iogen chose to use straw because the technology to bale it is available. Brian Foody, the president of the company, said other wastes could be used, including the entire corn plant, not just the kernels, which are used in existing ethanol plants. Even old newspapers are an option. Rapping on the wooden top of his desk, Mr. Foody said, ''We could even use this,'' although presumably people would choose scrap lumber over office furniture. 
 The trick is the enzyme, which is essentially a digestive juice of the fungus. Iogen sells enzymes that help convert wood pulp into paper, fade and soften denim and process animal feed. T. reesei, it turns out, works very well on cellulose, normally a tough material to break down.
 Mr. Passmore pointed out that if you put corn on a compost heap, the kernels are gone in a week, ''but the rest of the plant is still there a year later,'' he said. ''Mother nature didn't intend cellulose to break down.'' 
 Iogen delivered its first shipment of cellulosic ethanol in April 2004, and today, mixed with 15 percent gasoline, standard for ethanol fuel, it powers about 60 cars run by two Canadian federal agencies and another dozen Iogen cars, like Mr. Passmore's Sebring.
 The cars are all ''flexible fuel vehicles''; Detroit has produced millions of these, mostly because American regulations give automakers who build them a credit toward meeting minimum ''corporate average fuel economy'' requirements, whether or not the vehicles ever see a drop of ethanol. The ethanol industry said there were about 6.75 million flexible fuel vehicles in the United States, or about 3.2 percent of the 209.6 million cars and light-duty trucks on the road.
 The changes that are needed to make ethanol a bigger part of the nation's transportation fuel supply are fairly modest.
 Conventional cars can run on a mixture with up to 10 percent alcohol, the rest being gasoline. To go above 10 percent requires a flexible fuel vehicle, which can run on mixtures with up to 85 percent alcohol. The additional cost to produce flexible fuel vehicles is minimal. Millions of drivers already have flexible fuel vehicles but might not know it; the manual will say. The materials in the fuel system must be resistant to being broken down by alcohol, and certain engine controls must be adjusted.
 So, the car part is easy. But for now there are only about 400 filling stations in the United States that sell the 85 percent mixture, half of them in Minnesota and Illinois. A far larger fraction of the nation's 180,000 filling stations sell gasohol, the 10 percent blend.
 But ethanol is incompatible with the gasoline pipeline network, which sometimes has water in it; the alcohol bonds with water and becomes useless. So the ethanol must be shipped by tanker and blended where the trucks are loaded, or at the filling station. Shipping by tanker is fine over short distances, but not from the Corn Belt to the East Coast. With their ability to use a wider variety of raw materials, cellulosic ethanol factories could be more dispersed, thus closer to big gasoline markets. 
 No new technology is needed to blend ethanol, and the modifications required are small compared with bringing natural gas to service stations and pumping it up to thousands of pounds per square inch. Nor is new technology necessary for producing hydrogen for fuel-cell vehicles, to name two widely discussed alternatives. Both would require a different type of vehicle fleet.
 The United States now uses about four billion gallons a year of ethanol, compared with roughly 140 billion gallons of gasoline. Even the four billion figure gives the wrong impression because it has the energy value of about three billion gallons of gasoline.
 America could simply produce more ethanol by conventional means, mostly from corn starch. But making ethanol this way requires more energy than the finished product provides, according to the Argonne National Laboratory, a government research center in Illinois.
 Some of that energy -- sunshine -- is free, but substantial amounts of natural gas, liquid propane gas, coal, electricity and diesel fuel are also needed. In fact, to make ethanol that has the energy value of 8.5 gallons of gasoline requires about 6.3 gallons-worth of energy from various sources, which can include diesel, natural gas and coal. But since fuel that can go into a car tank is more valuable than coal or electricity, the equation looks attractive.
 Before the recent rise in gas prices, gasohol was popular partly because retailers pay 5.3 cents less in federal taxes on a gallon of gasoline blended with 10 percent ethanol, meaning that each gallon of ethanol gets a federal subsidy of 53 cents. At $3 for regular unleaded, ethanol becomes even more attractive. To many experts, ethanol is more a political phenomenon than an energy solution, a driver's subsidy to farms.
 ''The people who deal with this technology seem to be by and large coming at it from the point of view of advocacy, rather than hard facts about 'this is the production cost, this is the impact,''' said Dr. S.M. Shahed, a vice president at Honeywell Turbo Technologies and a former president of the Society of Automotive Engineers. 
 Cellulosic ethanol, though, requires far less energy to make, particularly if it is piggybacked on conventional corn ethanol, by using part of the corn that a conventional ethanol factory can't. Cellulosic and conventional ethanol could displace half of gasoline use, backers say. Cost remains a question.
 Any chemical engineer would argue that North America has plenty of hydrocarbons. But chemical engineers are the only ones who would say so, because most of the hydrocarbons are in solid form, as coal.
 Still, coal and oil, as well as natural gas, have the same building blocks: hydrogen and carbon. Refineries already play with hydrocarbons as if they were Tinker Toys, breaking down molecules that are too big for gasoline or diesel fuel and stringing together ones that are too small. For 75 years, various companies have done that with coal, though the technology's backers don't like to talk about it. During World War II, for example, German tanks rolled through half of Europe on fuel made that way.
 Several companies now think that this technology could be a moneymaker, probably using natural gas at first and coal later.
 Steam, or water in gaseous form, is introduced into a vessel filled with natural gas or coal with limited amounts of oxygen, resulting in ''synthesis gas,'' a mixture of hydrogen (some from the coal or gas and some from the water) and carbon monoxide.
 The economics depend partly on how much the factory pays for the coal or natural gas. Natural gas in the United States has soared in price even faster than oil, but at Syntroleum, a leader in the field, John B. Holmes Jr., the chief executive, points out that in many places around the world, natural gas is free. It is a nuisance that oil drillers, operating in areas where there are no pipelines, must burn off. Syntroleum is considering a project in Nigeria, where wells are expected to produce large volumes of unwanted gas along with $70-a-barrel oil.
 The company will convert the gas to a liquid fuel, a substitute for diesel, on the spot using a catalyst, then have tankers transport the liquid to market. 
 Mr. Holmes said that Syntroleum's fuel burns better and cleaner than diesel fuel because the chemical bonds between carbon atoms are simpler. ''We build these straight-chain molecules, just like you hook railroad cars together,'' Mr. Holmes said. Syntroleum's fuel is also sulfur-free. 
 As late as August, Syntroleum was telling investors that its fuel would be profitable with the price of oil at $25 to $50 a barrel.
 America's coal reserves are the equivalent of 29 billion barrels of oil when converted with the existing technology, the company estimates.
 The artificial diesel can be mixed with conventional diesel in any proportion. The F-T process can also work on other materials that are pyrolized; that is, heated in the presence of limited amounts of oxygen.
 But investors are wary of pioneering any technology that will succeed only if the cost estimates are correct and the price of the competition, crude oil, stays high. ''Everybody,'' Mr. Holmes said, ''wants to be the first person to build the second plant.''

Can Renewable Energy Ever Run a Car?
 FOR people who think that the end of oil is near, the mantra is renewable energy. And environmentalists sometimes describe windmills, a source of renewable energy, as oil derricks pulling energy from the sky. But the energy they create, electricity, is hard to use for transportation. The same problem confronts advocates of nuclear power.
 Thirty years ago, the United States used substantial oil to make electricity; an alternative energy source could free that oil for cars. But today only about 200,000 barrels of oil a day, or 1 percent of national consumption, goes into the electric system. Almost three-quarters of oil is gummy stuff, which is hard to turn into vehicle fuel. Some electricity is powered by diesel fuel, but it is used on peak-demand days, just a few hours a year, hard for a reactor or a windmill to replace.
 Windmills or reactors could displace natural gas, but natural-gas prices would have to come way down to create a market for compressed natural gas cars. 
 Electricity could run cars through batteries, but the current state of battery technology does not translate into a vehicle that Detroit thinks can be mass-marketed. The price differential is widening, however, since a compact car can go a mile on about 200 watt-hours, about 2 cents' worth. That is one-fifth the fuel cost for a gasoline-operated car that gets 30 miles a gallon, when gas is $3 a gallon. MATTHEW L. WALD

HEADLINE: Why the Hurricanes May Be Slowing the Bon Temps for Used-Car Buyers

BYLINE: By BARBARA WHITAKER

 BODY:
USED-CAR buyers found bargains galore this summer as trade-ins from record new-car sales flooded the market. But losses from back-to-back hurricanes are expected to start driving prices back up later this year.
 ''Not only has the supply side lost some vehicles, but demand will be up as well because so many cars have been destroyed by these storms,'' said Paul C. Taylor, chief economist with the National Automobile Dealers Association, a trade organization in McLean, Va. 
What remains to be seen is how many cars will actually be replaced. An estimated 475,000 cars were lost to Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, Mr. Taylor said. But of that number he predicted only about 300,000 to 400,000 would be replaced.
 Factors like lack of insurance, underinsurance and loans that were higher than the value of the car will make it difficult for some owners to replace their vehicles. Many owners will also not get around to replacing lost cars until they have taken care of more immediate issues like housing.
 Clouding the picture further are higher gas prices, which are thought to be slowing the sale of both new and used cars.
 ''Everything seems to be going sideways,'' said Marvin Suskin, a partner at Scarsdale Ford in Westchester County and former chairman of the Greater New York Automobile Dealers Association. ''People are sitting back waiting to see what's going to happen. What kind of deals are there going to be on new cars? What's going to happen with gas prices?''
 Employee pricing incentives offered by General Motors, the Ford Motor Company and DaimlerChrysler on new cars resulted in record sales of 1.8 million new cars, light trucks and vans in July alone. That led to a jump in the number of used cars for sale, because nearly 60 percent of the new-car purchases involved a trade-in.
 ''We put about 150,000 more cars into the marketplace in July than would be typical,'' Mr. Taylor said.
 As a result, used-car prices plummeted and, for now, remain down.
 ''We took in a lot of trades and now we're selling those at very good prices,'' Mr. Suskin said, adding that inventory of new cars was low. ''We're continuing to do that because we don't think we're going to get a good fill of '06's for another month or so.''
 Steven Kuhlman, a Sacramento--area real estate broker, said that earlier this year he shopped around for a new van, but found new-car inventories low. In June, he shifted his game plan and bought a used fully loaded, low-mileage 2003 Chrysler Town and Country van at CarMax for nearly half the price of a new van.
 ''There were just a ton of cars out there,'' Mr. Kuhlman said.
 In September, used-car prices were down 4.2 percent compared with the year before, according to Edmunds.com, the auto information Web site. But a close look at the figures reveals sharper declines in some segments than others, particularly large pickups, sport-utility vehicles and minivans. The price of used compact cars and compact pickups was actually up, 1.5 percent and 1.9 percent respectively.
 Art Spinella, president of CNW Marketing Research, a company in Bandon, Ore., that tracks automobile sales, predicts there will be a record number of used cars sold this year and, he said, despite higher gas prices there will still be a market for large S.U.V.'s and pickup trucks at drastically reduced prices.
 ''There's a lot of pent-up demand from those people who previously hadn't been able to afford to buy those,'' he said. ''Clearly one of the issues is, how low do you move the prices to move the product?''

HEADLINE: Safety/A Decoder Ring

BYLINE: By DANNY HAKIM

DATELINE: DETROIT 

 BODY:
THE Ford Escape is ''a genius on anything from dirt to gravel to granite,'' at least according to a recent ad in Maxim magazine. Not only does it have ''brains for rocks,'' whatever that means, it has a computer that checks for ''wheel slippage 200 times a second.'' 
 Not that any of that helped on the government's rollover test. The Escape, a sport-utility vehicle, tipped up on two wheels during the test, a potentially deadly result. The ad does not mention that, of course.
Likewise, an ad for the Dodge Durango in GQ boasts that it gets a ''five-star'' rating on the government's frontal crash test, but does not mention that the rear-wheel-drive version of the S.U.V. gets only three out of five stars on the government's rollover test and has been assessed a 21 percent risk of rolling over in a single-vehicle accident. 
 Ads for the 2005 Suzuki Verona do not mention safety at all, pitching it as a $17,994 way to ''reward your expectations.''
 As it happens, the sedan is one of a small number of vehicles that merit only three stars on the government's frontal crash test, a result that represents a significantly higher risk of serious injury in such accidents than competing vehicles. 
 Automakers, as one would expect, emphasize the positive. Suzuki said in a statement that all of its models were ''rigorously tested using a variety of methods.''
 The Verona notwithstanding, most vehicles can advertise a five-star safety rating from the government in some category. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has been conducting a frontal crash test since the late 1970's and a side impact test since 1996. If a vehicle can't ace these tests or come close, you may want to think twice about buying it. 
 ''Quite frankly, the scores are continuing to the point where it's rare for a vehicle not to get a four-star rating in a crash test,'' said Rae Tyson, an agency spokesman. ''It speaks to the fact that cars are safer now than they have ever been, but it also speaks to the fact that we have to update our crash test programs, particularly for side impacts, which we are in the process of doing.''
 Road fatality rates in the United States are lower than they have ever been, but there are still more than 30,000 deaths a year in cars, minivans, S.U.V.'s and pickup trucks, and many more injuries. When considering safety, the government's frontal and side impact tests are only one part of what most safety experts say consumers should be paying attention to. The government's newer rollover testing, for instance, offers a wider range of results. 
 There is plenty of free information on the Web from the two main entities that conduct crash testing. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration posts its data at www.safercars.gov, while the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (a research group financed by auto insurers) posts its information at www.iihs.org, including new evaluations of how well headrests lessen whiplash. 
 Consumer Reports magazine also compiles testing results from the government and insurers, runs vehicles through dozens of drive and handling tests and evaluates various design attributes, from blind spots to the difficulty of installing child seats. But looking up a vehicle on its Web site, www.consumerreports.org, requires a subscription. 
 Making sense of everything that's out there, and not out there, can be daunting. Consider that the Hummer H2 and other S.U.V.'s that weigh more than 8,500 pounds, when fully loaded, are exempt from federal crash testing and fuel economy regulations. This is a vestige of how the system was set up before families were riding in such heavy vehicles. Automakers have lobbied to keep the exemptions in place, although proposed legislation in Congress would make these vehicles subject to some crash testing in a few years. One should also consider that such vehicles do not have to meet many minimum performance standards governing the sturdiness of roofs, door latches and many other features.
 Only five models ace the government's front, side and rollover test, earning five stars in all categories. Because S.U.V.'s and pickups are at an inherent disadvantage in rollover evaluations, all five are sedans: Honda's Acura RL, the Volvo S80 and three Ford cars that are built on the same production line and essentially are the same vehicle: the Ford Crown Victoria, the Mercury Grand Marquis and the Lincoln Town Car. 
 Of the five, the Acura and Volvo also earned Best Pick designations from the insurance institute in their frontal crash tests. Both luxury sedans are loaded with technology aimed at preventing accidents, including one that safety experts say is particularly effective -- stability control -- a technology that applies braking to individual wheels to restore control to a driver when a vehicle swerves. Both sedans also have side air bags that protect your head -- some only protect the chest -- another feature praised by safety experts, which will be standard on most new vehicles by the end of the decade. 
 Performance on crash tests should not be the end-all. More research can be critical. For instance, the Crown Victoria, the Grand Marquis and the Lincoln Town Car are sturdy, but they are also the subject of continued scrutiny because of fires that are caused when their fuel tanks rupture during collisions. Ford has offered fire-shield kits to law enforcement agencies and limousine businesses that use the vehicles, but has angered consumer groups by not addressing the issue in cars owned by the general public. The company has argued that the specialty vehicles are more susceptible to problems. 
 Clarence Ditlow, director of the Center for Auto Safety, a consumer advocacy group, said, ''a good consumer looks for a vehicle that does well on the government and I.I.H.S. crash tests, but then you have defects like this which escape the tests.''
 For some vehicles, it helps to check the government's database of investigations and complaints at www-odi.nhtsa.dot.gov/cars/problems/recalls/recallsearch.cfm. 
 Looking at test results from both the government and the insurance institute is a good start because the institute's tests complement those performed by the government. For instance, in the government's frontal crash test, a car or truck is rammed against a solid barrier at 35 miles an hour. While accidents certainly happen at faster speeds, running into a solid wall is a severe event. By contrast, in the insurer's test, a car or truck runs into a deformable barrier, which has some flexibility, at 40 miles an hour. Furthermore, it's not a head-on crash, but an offset test where half of the front of the vehicle hits the barrier, showing how a vehicle's occupant compartment withstands a different kind of frontal collision.
 The insurance institute's new side impact tests are also more severe than the government's test because they replicate what it's like for a vehicle to be struck by an S.U.V. or a pickup. The government's older test procedure approximates what it's like to be hit in the side by a sedan, though the test is being updated. 
 The government has recently only begun rollover testing, and vehicles are showing a wide range of results. Rollovers account for about only 3 percent of all accidents but a third of all fatalities, or more than 10,000 deaths per year in the United States. S.U.V.'s and pickups are particularly vulnerable, but test results show that design and technology can make a significant difference in performance. That said, a safe vehicle does not have to be an expensive one. The government's rollover star rating is largely computed from a mathematical formula factoring in a vehicle's dimensions, while lesser emphasis is put on the tests conducted on a track. The reasoning is that most rollovers do not occur on a uniform surface, like a track, but happen when a vehicle is ''tripped,'' say, by veering off the road or hitting a curb. 
 Still, it is interesting to know what vehicles tip up on two wheels, because most do not. This information is not easy to find. When you look up a vehicle on www.safercars.gov, it is possible to click on the rating that comes up, then drill down a level further and get a mini report card on a vehicle's results. Among the interesting details that emerge is a percentage assessment of rollover risk, which gives a much more specific picture of the data than star ratings. For instance, a pickup version of the Ford Explorer, called the Explorer Sport Trac, has the highest overall rollover risk assessment, at 34 percent in single-vehicle accidents for the rear-wheel-drive version. 
 You can also learn if a vehicle has an unusual safety warning. For instance, during testing of the 2005 BMW 3-Series sedan, an interior door panel was pushed into the pelvis of a crash test dummy, generating unusually high injury readings. 
 ''I'd recommend that consumers look for vehicles that do well in all of the categories,'' said Adrian K. Lund, chairman of the insurance institute. ''What you should expect is to find a vehicle that does well across the board. You don't want to find one that is good at frontal impact performance but not in a side impact crash.'' 
 At the very least, it is useful to compare a potential purchase with its competition. Even this can be challenging. Not all vehicles are tested in the course of a year, because it is expensive and time consuming, so there can be gaps in the results. Brand-new models, like Chevrolet's HHR, have yet to have any test results. Mr. Ditlow's consumer group recommends not buying all-new vehicles in their first year of production.
 And then there are vehicles that have been totally redesigned, meaning that test scores from previous models don't really apply. One tip-off is that the vehicle is usually advertised as ''all-new'' if it has had a major redesign. 
 The Toyota Tacoma, for instance, is a pickup that can jump through a giant ring of fire, according to a recent ad in ESPN the Magazine, and ''defy stuff like mud, dirt, physics and gravity.'' 
 But a rollover test? Not so much. The Tacoma tipped up on two wheels during testing performed by federal regulators. At least the 2004 model did. The redesigned Tacoma will be retested this year.


GRAPHIC: Photo: HIGH MARKS -- The Volvo S80, far left, and Honda's Acura RL are the only cars to get top rankings in all government and insurance industry tests. The Acura, shown above, like many of the higher-ranking cars, has six air bags: two front, two side and two curtain, which form a barrier across the driver-side and passenger windows. (pg. G38)Drawing (Drawing by mckibillo)(pg. G1)Chart: ''Stalking the Details''Information about how specific car models fared on government ratings from front and side crashes and rollover tests can be found at safercars.gov. Clicking on a car's name brings up this page with more information about the ratings and other tests. Any major safety concerns about the vehicle would also be noted here. Clicking on the listing for each test then brings up a more detailed explanation of methodology.Electronic Stability Control -- In loss-of-control situations, engine speed is reduced and braking is taken over automatically, helping to steer the vehicle. A link to a list of all 2006 models equipped with the control can be found on the left side of the Safercars.gov home page.Head Injury Criterion -- This number increases exponentially. A score over 500 means there is a 4 percent chance of severe head injury, while a score over 1,000 indicates a 20 percent chance for severe head injury.Thoracic Trauma Index -- This score determines the star rating for the side crash test. A vehicle gets five stars if it scores below 57, which is a 5 percent chance of severe chest trauma. A score of 75 or higher means the vehicle receives three stars and has an 11 to 20 percent chance of serious injury to the chest.Chance of Rollover -- The likelihood that your vehicle will roll over in a single vehicle crash. A 10 percent chance or less gives a vehicle a five-star rollover rating.Static Stability Factor -- One of the two components that determine chance of rollover. This measures the top-heaviness of the vehicle based on the size of its base and the height of its center of gravity. The number range is small, from 1 to 1.6
 a higher number means a more stable vehicle. Drivers can inadvertantly make the car more top-heavy by putting too many items on top.Dynamic Test Result -- This test simulates the fishhook swerve that often happens when avoiding a collision -- the wheel is turned one direction, then quickly turned back in the other direction. It is checked at 50 m.p.h. to see if two wheels on one side come up off the road by two inches. If it does, it gets a ''tip.''(Source by National Highway Traffic Safety Administration)(pg. G38)

HEADLINE: It's Just Roy At the Cafe, And on TV In the Series

BYLINE: By JACK CURRY

DATELINE: HOUSTON, Oct. 25 

 BODY:
Roy Oswalt said he knows everybody in Weir, Miss., the no-stoplight town of 553 people, give or take a few dozen, where he was born, where he still lives and where people treat him like just another local.
 ''He's not Roy the pitcher to us,'' said Glen Beard, the mayor of Weir. ''He's just Roy.'' 
So Oswalt saunters into the Weir Cafe & Grill after he is done pitching for the Houston Astros to talk about the high school football team, hunting and fishing or anything else that is noteworthy at the only place in town to grab a tasty meal. He blends in like the place mats.
 ''We have lunch specials every day,'' said Martha Miller, the owner of the cafe. ''He orders the rib-eye sandwich and fries. It's $4.99.''
 If Oswalt needs gas for the equipment on his 40-acre farm, he stops at Henson's Mini-Mart where Wade Henson has owned the place for 36 years. When Oswalt buys gas, Henson said, he usually picks up a soda, too. He is just Roy, another guy filling gas canisters, Henson repeated.
 ''We've known him since he was in diapers,'' Henson said. ''He comes from good stock. His parents are top-notch. They're good, common country folk.''
 Those country folk are Billy Joe, who is a logger in a town where timber rules the economy, and Jean, who drives a school bus. Their son started Game 3 of the World Series against the Chicago White Sox on Tuesday night. With the Astros trailing, 2-0, in the best-of-seven series, they needed Oswalt, the pride of Weir, to save them 
 ''We really need to win this to not go 3-0,'' Oswalt said. 
 Everything in Weir (pronounced where) is conveniently situated and that allows the 28-year-old Oswalt to cross Highway 12 from Henson's and visit the S & S Service Center. Robin Sheedy proudly said she and her husband, Glenn, service Oswalt's vehicles. It took Sheedy less than a minute to also mention that Glenn and Roy attended high school together. 
 ''Roy brings his pickups, the little black car, the big stuff, everything, here,'' said Robin Sheedy. ''We do the cars for everyone in his family.''
 Clearly, Oswalt was not exaggerating when he said everyone knows him and he knows everyone. Donald Crowder, who has owned Crowder's Drug Store for 35 years, fills prescriptions for the Oswalts by day and collects baseball cards from Oswalt's superb career with the Astros by night.
 Still, Crowder does not stock his shelves with Oswalt pictures, T-shirts, baseballs or jerseys, even though they would vanish in hours. The people of Weir are protective of Oswalt, their neighbor who happens to be one of the elite pitchers in the major leagues, which is why they are adamant about not crowding him. 
 ''We want him to be part of our community,'' Crowder said, ''not separated from our community.''
 When Oswalt needed a spiritual boost, he knew where to travel in Weir as well. After Oswalt finished his rookie year in 2001, he drove his pickup truck to DeWitt Cutts's farm. Cutts heard the rumbling of the truck, spotted Oswalt and, before Cutts could utter anything, Oswalt spoke.
 ''He said, 'I want to be baptized,''' Cutts recalled. ''I told him, 'You've come to the right place.'''
 Cutts, who was the pastor at a Baptist church in Kilmichael, Miss., lived a few houses away from Oswalt in Weir and had known Roy all of his life. Since Oswalt was eager to be baptized, Cutts asked him if wanted to be saved. But Cutts said Oswalt told him, ''Don't bother me with that. I've been saved. I want to follow the Lord.'' 
 Beard, who is in his fifth year as mayor, coached Oswalt in football and also taught him history and economics in high school at Weir Attendance Center. Oswalt was a wide receiver and defensive back on a team that won a state title in his senior year. Until Oswalt's father campaigned for a baseball team, the high school did not field one.
 As Beard talks about Oswalt, he fills each sentence with superlatives. He said Oswalt is polite, sincere and down to earth, as stellar a person as he is a pitcher. 
 ''As far as being successful, Roy has been successful at everything he's done, especially baseball,'' Beard said. ''I think this place might be a lot of the reason for his success.''
 Oswalt agreed, saying he was constantly told that he was from too small of a town to be competitive with the players from bigger places. That basically meant every town and essentially meant Oswalt was being told he could not compete with anyone. 
 Since Oswalt was not offered a Division I scholarship, he pitched at Holmes Community College in Goodman, Miss. After his freshman season, the Astros drafted Oswalt in the 23rd round and the kid from nowhere signed for $500,000. Soon, the kid from Weir would become the kid from somewhere.
 ''Since you're from a small place, no one really cares where you're from,'' Oswalt said. ''So it kind of drives you a little.''
 Weir is in Choctaw County, a dry county, so there is no place to purchase alcoholic beverages. No restaurant in town serves dinner, so Beard said most residents would be glued to their televisions watching Oswalt in Game 3. Beard said the streets in Weir would be quiet, then chuckled. 
 ''This,'' Beard said, ''is a quiet town anyway.''

HEADLINE: Begin With Interest Rates, Move to E.R.A.

BYLINE: By DAVID LEONHARDT

 BODY:
The man nominated to be the next chairman of the Federal Reserve knows of one policy he would like to change. Earned run average, he says, needs to be calculated in a way that is fairer to pitchers who leave runners on base. 
 Ben S. Bernanke, whom President Bush named this week to succeed Alan Greenspan as Fed chairman, has spent much of the last three decades studying interest-rate policy. But Bernanke, 51, has also found more than a little time for sports.
 After giving up squash because of a bad elbow, he turned to playing two-on-two basketball, sometimes on the squash court inside the Federal Reserve's headquarters in Washington. He attended Game 6 of the 1975 World Series between the Boston Red Sox and the Cincinnati Reds, famous for Carlton Fisk's game-winning home run in the 12th inning. Bernanke has also devoured the writings of Bill James, the founder of baseball's statistical revolution.
 ''Ben was a very good squash player; I gave up trying to be competitive with him,'' said Mark Gertler, a longtime friend who is an economist at New York University. ''My competitive advantage with him was more in basketball because I'm three or four inches taller. But even there he was pretty tenacious.''
 There is something of a history to Federal Reserve chairmen being among the nation's most prominent sportsmen and sports fans, much of it involving tennis. Greenspan plays tennis twice a week, and he can also be seen regularly inside the owner's box at Redskins games.
 Bernanke, a Southerner by birth who stands well shy of 6 feet, became a Red Sox fan in the mid-1970's while he was a student at Harvard. After moving to Princeton as a professor, he kept his allegiance to the Red Sox. He also became fascinated by the way that statistics can capture the game or distort it, much as they can for the economy.
 Bernanke and Dwight M. Jaffee, a Princeton colleague, had a regular squash game, and they spent their walks to the campus gym talking about monetary policy and baseball, Jaffee said. Bernanke was particularly bothered by E.R.A., the main yardstick of pitching. If one pitcher leaves runners on base and another pitcher allows them to score, the runs are charged to the first pitcher. 
 Pitchers unlucky enough to be followed by ineffective relievers, as the Yankees' Randy Johnson was in 2005, have unfairly high E.R.A.'s. Pitchers who are bailed out by their bullpen, as Roy Oswalt of the Astros often was this season, end up with artificially low E.R.A.'s.
 A better system would divide blame, depending on the base the runners were on when a pitcher departed and the number of outs, Bernanke argued.
 ''He was always saying, 'We ought to come up with a solution for this,''' Jaffee said.
 This summer, Jaffee saw an article in The New York Times on the same topic and sent an e-mail message to Bernanke reminding him of their walks. Bernanke replied that his opinion had not changed.
 He also mentioned that the Washington Nationals, his new favorite team, had lost 13 one-run games in a row. The odds of that happening, Bernanke wrote, were roughly 8,000 to 1.

HEADLINE: As Costs Rise in Queens, So Do Doubts About Bloomberg

BYLINE: By PATRICK D. HEALY

 BODY:
Starbucks aficionados, Giuliani Democrats and brownstone Brooklynites all may be ready to hand Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg a second term. But in a vote-rich swath of Queens neighborhoods that is a battleground in mayoral elections, there are some New Yorkers quietly seething at the incumbent.
 Scattered through southeast Queens are boxy apartments where rents have risen sharply in the last four years, one- and two-family homes where property tax bills have jumped almost by half, and corner stores where ''Bloomberg'' often passes as a profanity.
Complaining about the cost of living may be nothing new for New Yorkers there, but they are stunned that the mayor seems to be cruising toward re-election -- with a new poll yesterday giving him a 31-point lead -- despite the anger they discuss daily with their friends, in-laws and colleagues.
 ''It's impossible for people like me and my family to find an affordable house because taxes cost more -- let's face it, everything costs more,'' said Ernesto Silva Jr., a child services caseworker for the city who lives in South Ozone Park with his wife, Pat, and their two children. ''I can't vote for Bloomberg again. He hasn't done anything to make it less expensive to live here.'' 
 Middle-class Queens neighborhoods like Mr. Silva's, not far from Brooklyn's eastern border, have been bellwethers in past elections: home to voters of all political colors who unleashed their fury at John V. Lindsay, embraced Edward I. Koch and grudgingly respected for Rudolph W. Giuliani, and who rallied to the antitax banner of Representative Anthony D. Weiner in last month's mayoral primary. Feeling overlooked in the fall election, they blame Mr. Bloomberg for a gut sense that the American Dream is unaffordable.
 This anger transcends racial lines, stretching across minority enclaves from Rochdale Village to Cambria Heights that are crucial to the electoral fortunes on Nov. 8 of both Mr. Bloomberg and his Democratic challenger, Fernando Ferrer, who, for all his attempts to capitalize on such anger, appears not to be drawing in many voters either.
 ''Even Stevie Wonder can see that people are getting poorer, working people are really being squeezed, you can't buy a home,'' said Eulynis Farmes, riding the 83 bus along Liberty Avenue in St. Alban's, Queens. ''But you listen to the mayor and 'everything's fine.'''
 For some, it is the property tax increase of 18.5 percent, spiraling assessments, the temporary spikes in sales and income taxes -- and the feeling that Mr. Bloomberg, a Republican, seems to have a free pass from criticism despite his previous no-new-taxes pledges. For others, it is the lack of low-cost housing, the fines for trash and parking violations, as well as towing costs, the $7 packs of cigarettes, even the $3 gallon of gas.
 The fact that the mayor of New York has no control over gasoline prices, and that he has pressed for property tax rebates and other relief in the last two years, is both true and beside the point, at least in the hearts of these voters. 
 ''It's a difficult thing for the one-, two- three-family homes to deal with ever-increasing taxes,'' said Betty Braton of Howard Beach. ''There's a thriving real estate market, but that can work against working-class people.'' Ms. Braton, a community board veteran in Queens, also praised the mayor, saying his educational and economic development policies had helped the borough.
 Mr. Ferrer still remains a stranger to many of the residents, lacking the high profile of an incumbent and the money to advertise heavily on television. He has decried rising poverty rates and a lack of low-cost housing, and yesterday began denouncing the divide between haves and have-nots in New York. What voters do not know is how he would tackle these issues.
 ''So this is my choice for mayor: Mike 'tax tax tax tax tax' Bloomberg or Freddy 'I'll-make-the-city-better-but-I-have-no-plans-right-now' Ferrer,'' said Monia Prosper of Rochdale Village. ''C'mon. I'll probably go with Ferrer, but this is not a choice.''
 In South Ozone Park, Pat Silva, Ernesto's wife, said that while Mr. Ferrer was less known because he has had so few commercials on television, Mr. Bloomberg's heavy personal spending on ads were not necessarily a plus. She saw one ad in which he sought to relate to New Yorkers upset about affordable housing. To her, Mr. Bloomberg knows only from where he lives.
 ''His style, his priorities, his interests are totally Manhattan-centric,'' she said, citing his failed plan for a West Side football stadium and his lifestyle on the Upper East Side. ''Where are the evidence and results that he's lowering the cost of living in the outer boroughs?''
 At a South Ozone Park civic association meeting last week, however, she was in the minority when the mayor dropped by. Mr. Bloomberg, showing a deft political touch, stuck to hard and memorable facts about New York being ranked as the safest large city in America and student math and English scores rising in the local district. And he acknowledged Ms. Silva's unspoken concerns, too.
 ''Our big problems are not enough affordable housing and not enough real estate,'' the mayor told the 75 local residents in a church basement. (The next day, he proposed new steps to preserve or build an additional 100,000 homes for the poor and middle-income families.)
 Kathy DiLieto, who attended the meeting with her husband, George, said she was ''not a bit happy'' that her property taxes had risen several hundred dollars under Mr. Bloomberg. At the same time, she said she could not blame him. ''He brought us back after 9/11,'' Ms. DiLieto said. ''What're you going to do, criticize him?'' 
 Some Republicans and Democrats say that frustration over taxes and affordability is the sleeper issue in the race. Aides to the mayor say he stuck to his pledge not to raise taxes for as long as possible, only proposing the property tax increase -- originally 25 percent -- in November 2002 to close a budget gap of $1.1 billion and a looming shortfall of $6 billion in 2003. While the rate increase totaled 18.5 percent, rising assessments and valuations have driven up tax bills even more. In turn, the city sent $400 rebate checks to property owners in 2004 and 2005, and plans to do so next year.
 Even more infuriating to some have been the new fees and fines: Parking fines increased from $55 to $105 for serious violations, towing fees rose from $150 to $185, and sanitation fines rose from $50 to $100.
 Despite the tax and fee increases, Mr. Bloomberg has held a comfortable lead in the polls -- a sign that New Yorkers may accept higher taxes when local services seem to be improving, or that they felt that the economic crisis after 9/11 took precedence. The city also reduced its work force and cut spending heavily..
 ''He was essentially faced with firing cops, firefighters, and teachers, or finding revenue to pay them,'' said Edward Skyler, the mayor's spokesman. ''He decided that the safety and quality of life in the city were more important than any political hit.''
 Yet a forthcoming report by the Manhattan Institute for Policy Research, a nonprofit research group with a conservative tilt, will argue that the higher taxes have contributed as much as $3 billion in new revenue, yet the mayor has not overhauled fixed costs such as pensions and debt service to avoid further tax increases, according to the group's Nicole Gelinas. 
 ''The mayor has not used his first term, and the cushion of the tax increases, to reform the budget,'' Ms. Gelinas said. ''People are angry, but the mayor has dodged public debate about it.''
 Ms. Silva said the mayor could have eased her anger if he had taken on the high cost of living as a campaign crusade. ''I could have been won over if I truly felt he saw the middle class in crisis,'' she said. ''But where's the evidence? Costs just get higher and higher.''

HEADLINE: Some New Help for the Extremely Gifted Students 

BYLINE: By MICHAEL JANOFSKY

DATELINE: RENO, Nev. 

 BODY:
Misha Raffiee is 10 years old. An eighth grader in her final year of private school here, she reads up to six books a month, plays violin and piano and asks so many questions that her teachers sometimes get angry at her.
 Driven by an insatiable curiosity, she wants to be a brain surgeon. Her parents expect her to have a bachelor's degree by the time she is 14 and a medical degree soon after. The pace will be wholly dependent upon her teachers' abilities to feed an intellect that in her current setting often goes wanting.
''I do wish they would go faster,'' she said of her classroom activities. ''If I could go at my own pace, I could go forward twice as fast.''
 By next fall, Misha may have her chance. She has applied to the Davidson Academy of Nevada, a newly formed public school at the University of Nevada, Reno for profoundly gifted children, those whose test scores and evaluations place them in the 99.9th percentile. 
 It is a rare opportunity. Children like Misha, who have I.Q.'s of 160 and above, constitute only a tiny fraction of the 72 million children who attend the nation's public and private schools. Their needs are often overlooked as federal and state governments concentrate their resources on slower learners to lift test scores in reading and mathematics to a minimum standard. 
 While federal spending for the Bush administration's education law, No Child Left Behind, is to reach $24.4 billion in the current fiscal year, the Department of Education has allocated only $11 million for programs aimed at ''gifted and talented'' students. Recognizing that children with unusually high aptitude require special attention and more rigorous coursework, many communities try to serve them through schools that offer specialized classes, accelerated learning programs and dual credit for high school and college.
 In addition, a small but growing number of charter, magnet and early-entrance schools are tailoring their curriculums to prepare students for college. And foundations, like the Institute for Educational Advancement in South Pasadena, Calif., are forming to help gifted children find programs to challenge them.
 Susan Aspey, a spokeswoman for the Department of Education, said the ''vast majority'' of federal spending for children in kindergarten through 12th grade was for the neediest children. Why so little money for the brightest children?
 ''Unfortunately,'' she said, ''we don't live in a perfect world with infinite resources.''
 Education experts familiar with the needs of the most gifted students say there are scarcely enough programs to serve them.
 ''We are undercutting the research and development people of this nation,'' said Joseph S. Renzulli, director of the National Research Center on the Gifted and Talented, at the University of Connecticut. ''No one would ever argue against No Child Left Behind, but when you ignore kids who will create new jobs, new therapies and new medicines, we're selling them down the river.''
 Nancy Green, executive director of the National Association for Gifted Children, said that state and local efforts were admirable but that their inconsistency reflected lost opportunities. A new survey by her association found that among 39 states that responded, 24 spent as much as $10 million on programs for gifted children but 7 spent less than $1 million and 8 spent nothing.
 ''For a nation, I'm not sure why we value equity over excellence,'' Ms. Green said. ''All kids are entitled to an appropriate education for their ability, not just those we're teaching to a minimum standard.''
 A 2004 report by the International Center for Gifted Education and Talent Development at the University of Iowa charges American schools with impeding the development of the country's brightest children and calls the lack of more programs for them ''a national scandal.'' It warns, ''The price may be the slow but steady erosion of American excellence.''
 The Davidson Academy would be an unusual addition to the options available to especially smart children, according to its founders, Bob and Jan Davidson, a retired couple who made a fortune designing educational software. In 1999, they created a foundation dedicated to serving highly gifted children and, as part of it, a summer scholarship program that enables students aged 12 to 15 to earn up to seven college credits at the University of Nevada, Reno. 
 Mr. Davidson said the academy, an outgrowth of the summer program, was the nation's first public school for gifted students created by a private foundation and codified by state law. In June, Gov. Kenny C. Guinn signed a bill that authorized public schools for ''profoundly gifted pupils'' to operate in a university setting. 
 ''Our families in the summer program started asking us to start a school,'' Ms. Davidson said. ''We told them that we were not interested in raising their children. But they told us that if we built a school, they would come.''
 With plans to accept 30 applicants for the first year and twice that for the second, the academy will be open to any students living in Nevada who can perform at a sixth-grade level or better and can demonstrate exceptional abilities through achievement tests and letters of recommendation. Already, Mr. Davidson said, applications have arrived from students in California and the East Coast whose parents said they would be willing to move to Nevada.
 The curriculum is intended to be flexible, Mr. Davidson said, to satisfy the individual needs and interests of each student. Some courses will be available for dual credit in high school and college; some, for just college credit. Students will also have a choice of taking courses in the usual manner of 15 weeks or in an immersion format of 3 weeks. In either case, students will be invited to specialize, but they must also take classes, like history and civics, that are required for a public high school diploma in Nevada. 
 The Davidsons said they intended to cover all student costs -- a minimum of $10,000 a student each year -- except for those courses taken only for college credit. They are also assuming some of the construction costs of a $50 million building where the academy will eventually be housed. The state has agreed to pay $31 million of the construction costs.
 For Misha's parents, Kambiz, an associate dean at the university, and his wife, Simi, a former bank economist, the academy could not have come along at a more opportune time. They have watched their child in wonderment -- ''She was reading at 2, reading chapter books at 3,'' her mother said -- and worried how to keep her stimulated next year. ''Had this not come up,'' Mrs. Raffiee said, ''we were seriously considering taking her elsewhere.''
 Misha seemed overjoyed at the prospect of attending a challenging school near home. She can keep her friends, continue swimming with her community team and remain as violinist and associate concert master with the Reno Philharmonic Youth Symphony Orchestra.
 ''It would be a lot better if it started this year,'' she said of the academy. ''A lot of times now, I ask three and four questions that are really complex, and the teacher stops and says, 'We're not getting into that; let's go on to another subject.' At the academy, I know I could ask whatever I wanted and the teacher wouldn't get mad.''

HEADLINE: Its Work Force Scattered, New Orleans Wrestles With Job Crisis 

BYLINE: By CHRISTINE HAUSER

DATELINE: NEW ORLEANS, Oct. 21 

 BODY:
At lunchtime, the music is loud and lively at the Five O'Clock Grille on Bourbon Street. Waiters polish tables. Bartenders pour drinks from rows of gleaming bottles. And the restaurant's doors are thrown open, as if to make it easier for a passer-by to become a patron.
 But behind the welcoming facade, the restaurant is grappling with a staffing crisis, not unlike the city's as a whole. Only about 20 of the 108 employees who worked for the owners before Hurricane Katrina are back on the job. Among the waiters are five single men just arrived from Kentucky and living in trailers. There is a ''help wanted'' sign in the windows, and one longtime employee is hundreds of miles away, waiting for unemployment benefits. The hours are shorter, and the menu is limited.
''The majority are not coming back,'' the general manager, Irvin Dussom, said shortly before making a phone call to try to find a local apartment for a former worker. ''They are having trouble finding housing here, or they are satisfied with the housing where they are.'' 
 Large numbers of workers who lived in New Orleans are now scattered throughout Louisiana or neighboring states, unable to return to flood-damaged houses and leaving hundreds of businesses unable to reopen or operating below capacity. Many are out of contact, or have settled elsewhere to enroll their children in schools.
 Some positions are being filled by people from other states looking for new job opportunities in construction or, as in the case of the Five O'Clock Grille, service jobs.
 Even as many jobs go begging, unemployment has spiked, driven not only by the dislocation of workers but also by the shuttering of flood-devastated businesses in no condition to reopen. Since the hurricane, the Louisiana Labor Department has received 296,000 unemployment insurance claims. In all of 2004, there were a bit more than 193,000.
 There are also longer-term implications. With jobs lost, shuffled and solicited, the work-force crisis is changing the very demography of New Orleans.
 With schools still closed, for example, families have migrated to other states to look for work and stability. Many of the newer workers here are younger and single, able to double up in apartments. Better-off and more mobile workers, some commuting from nearby areas, have begun to replace workers who could not afford cars.
 One of the new waiters at the Five O' Clock Grille is Shelby Molohon, 21, who drove 15 hours from Kentucky to repair roofs. When that job fell through, he drifted into the French Quarter. ''I like the area,'' he said. ''I want to stay.''
 Some families have become single-parent households, with a mother or father absent out of necessity. ''A lot of people are doing what I am doing: they are commuting, and their family is staying somewhere else,'' said JoAnn Madison, a 40-year old waitress who reclaimed her job at the Sheraton here, where she lives in a hotel room while her husband, who is not working, and son live in Baton Rouge.
 The French Quarter emerged relatively unscathed from Hurricanes Katrina and Rita and the flooding they brought. But beyond its balconies and courtyards, swaths of residential areas are still without housing, electricity, schools, water, gas and public transportation. Without housing for workers, many businesses cannot open. And without services from businesses and government, many workers will not return.
 ''You've got this real chicken-and-egg problem,'' said Peter Ricchiuti, an assistant dean at Tulane University's business school.
 Gov. Kathleen Babineaux Blanco said at a recent news conference that restoring the hospitality sector, a cornerstone of the New Orleans economy, was a high priority for the state. Mayor C. Ray Nagin said the city was trying to get trailers or other temporary housing for workers, possibly tent cities. The Louisiana Labor Department's plans include job fairs, transportation services and Internet resume-matching.
 But it is not clear how long it will take to repair the symbiosis between housing and jobs.
 ''On a long-term basis, we have got to make sure to rebuild and repopulate these cities with the folks who lived there before,'' said Andrew Kopplin, the governor's chief of staff. ''It is a mismatch of where jobs are available and where workers are.'' 
 Mr. Kopplin added that in some cases, oil platform workers and pipe fitters had found that they could earn more money driving debris trucks for the cleanup, making it harder for businesses to restart.
 In New Orleans alone, 81,000 businesses were disrupted in some way by the hurricanes, Mr. Kopplin said. Hotels have tried to adapt by cleaning rooms less often, restaurants by limiting hours and offering smaller menus.
 At the landmark Napoleon House restaurant in the French Quarter, the owner's son, Nicholas Impastato, 35, pitches in to cook the lunch fare of jambalaya, gumbo and red beans and rice.
 ''Two of the guys who worked here for years and years, they are set for a year in Ohio,'' Mr. Impastato said, pausing in the restaurant's courtyard, where ceiling fans rotated lazily overhead. ''They have no home to come back to.''
 Some who might like to return are still stuck in nearby cities working at jobs beneath their qualifications just to make ends meet. Robert Myer, an owner of Express Personnel Services in Baton Rouge, said he had placed teachers in administrative jobs and athletic coaches as assistants with the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
 ''There are people who are changing fields completely,'' Mr. Myer said. ''They say, 'I just have to work,' and don't know if their companies are going back. Then there are people who say they want to go back but they have to educate their kids. Or they can't let their kids live in a house where there is mold growing.''
 Debra Young, a 52-year old teacher from New Orleans, went to a job fair in Baton Rouge and picked up an application for a rental car company, but for days could not bring herself to fill it out.
 ''It is not easy to find a job here,'' Ms. Young said. ''They want some of us to go to Burger King, but that's not why I went to school. I am trying to find something close to what I studied.''
 Karin Peri-Ramos, a 39-year-old divorced mother of three, earned about $33,000 a year as floor manager of the Five O'Clock Grille before leaving her flooded house in the Bywater neighborhood of New Orleans. She settled into a borrowed house in Marietta, Ga., enrolled her children in school and is living on $4,300 from FEMA as she waits for unemployment benefits. For now she is trying to keep her foot in the door at the restaurant, driving seven to eight hours each way every other weekend to work, hoping the management will stick with her.
 ''I want to go back home,'' she said. ''But not now. I don't have a school for my children and don't have electricity. The gas is off.''
 Ms. Peri-Ramos says she worked through the aftermath of previous hurricanes, but like thousands of other people is now unable to return to her damaged house. Instead of a salary, she is counting on a new currency: loyalty from the Five O'Clock Grille.
 ''They could hire someone to take my place,'' she said, ''but I never left them before.''

HEADLINE: At the Fed, an Unknown Became a Safe Choice

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 25 

 BODY:
In the summer, a senior administration official summed up the search for a new Federal Reserve chairman this way: ''We've got at least three good choices, but we're not in love with any of them.'' 
 In nominating Ben S. Bernanke to succeed Alan Greenspan as Fed chairman, President Bush selected an economist with stellar credentials and a good reputation in Congress and on Wall Street who has won widespread plaudits since being named on Monday.
 But Mr. Bernanke was also an out-of-the-ordinary choice. Virtually unknown outside of academia four years ago, in recent months he emerged as a front-runner, leaping ahead of veteran Republicans who have advised Mr. Bush for years and helped engineer his huge tax cuts of 2001 and 2003. 
 It was a remarkable ascent to the most powerful economic post in the nation, especially given Mr. Bush's tendency to promote people from a small circle of colleagues and advisers he has known for years and trusts implicitly. 
 In settling on Mr. Bernanke, President Bush avoided embroiling himself in another confirmation fight at a time when Republicans and Democrats alike are questioning his nomination of Harriet E. Miers to the Supreme Court. But in doing so, he essentially chose a candidate who would satisfy others -- investors on Wall Street, lawmakers in Congress -- more than himself or his Republican base. 
 Mr. Bernanke was not the first choice of ardent supporters of supply-side economics, who favor deep tax cuts and tight monetary policy as the best medicine to strengthen the economy. They tended to favor R. Glenn Hubbard, an architect of Mr. Bush's sweeping tax cuts and one of the leading candidates. Others in the White House leaned toward Martin S. Feldstein, a Harvard economist who served as President Ronald Reagan's chief economic adviser. 
 Nor was Mr. Bernanke the first choice of Mr. Greenspan, according to people close to the deliberations. Mr. Greenspan quietly pushed for Donald L. Kohn, a Fed governor and political independent who had previously been his chief of staff. 
 But Mr. Bernanke had what many outsiders wanted: a world-class reputation among economists; credibility on Wall Street; a confidence and an air of political independence that seemed free from hints of cronyism. 
 ''He was the safe choice, somebody with unquestioned qualifications,'' said Bruce Bartlett, a conservative economic analyst who worked under President Reagan and the first President Bush. ''They needed somebody that everybody, including the financial markets, would react positively to.'' 
 Mr. Bernanke's political rise owes much to Mr. Hubbard, who was chairman of President Bush's Council of Economic Advisers from 2001 until early 2003. Mr. Hubbard pushed hard for the White House to name Mr. Bernanke to an open seat on the Fed board.
 Two former administration officials said Mr. Hubbard had fended off what he considered inferior candidates favored by Lawrence B. Lindsey, then director of the National Economic Council. ''At the time, nobody had any idea who Ben Bernanke was,'' said one former White House official.
 But Mr. Bernanke (pronounced ber-NANK-ee) quickly made an impression at the Fed, speaking out on a wide array of topics about the economy as well as about the central bank's need to become more open and to peg policy to publicly stated inflation targets.
 Last spring, Mr. Bush nominated Mr. Bernanke to take over as chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers. The move was widely seen as an effort to gauge Mr. Bernanke's suitability for becoming Fed chairman when Mr. Greenspan's term expired in early 2006. 
 But one former administration official said the White House had not progressed that far in its thinking about the Fed. Mr. Bush's decision to recruit Mr. Bernanke to the White House came at the urging of N. Gregory Mankiw, who had been Mr. Bush's economic adviser but was returning to Harvard.
 Mr. Bernanke, who had just been named to a new term at the Fed and had bought a home on Capitol Hill in Washington, clearly had a longing for Mr. Greenspan's job. At a meeting with reporters shortly after he joined the White House, Mr. Bernanke said he would feel free to advise the president about nominees to empty seats on the Fed board -- but not about nominees for chairman.
 The unstated message was that he considered himself a candidate.

Supply-Side Concerns
 By Tuesday, there was already some quiet grumbling from ardent supporters of supply-side economics who fretted that Mr. Bernanke might be too conventional to put a distinctively Bush-like imprint on the Fed. ''Supply-siders would have preferred Glenn Hubbard,'' said Michael T. Darda, chief economist at MKM Partners in Greenwich, Conn., and a promoter of supply-side ideas. 
 By all accounts, Mr. Bernanke is a rigorous and tough-minded economist who has spent his entire career delving into some of the hardest issues in monetary economics. Mr. Bernanke is not ideological, though he is a Republican. He is unlikely to criticize Mr. Bush for his tax cuts, even if the deficit continues to widen, but he is equally unlikely to be a ringing champion for conservative policy goals like privatizing Social Security. 
 ''The administration needs someone who is not going to embarrass them, and Bernanke clearly fills that bill,'' Mr. Darda said. ''He's not going to say the federal funds rate has to go up by 75 basis points because the deficit is too high.'' A basis point is a hundredth of a percentage point.
 But Mr. Bernanke could turn out to be more exciting and more steely than many investors now expect. Early in his career, he tackled one of the biggest and broadest issues in macroeconomics -- the origins of the Great Depression -- and he broke new ground in showing how orthodox monetary policy at that time played a crucial role. 
 The lessons of the Depression sometimes seem to hover behind much of his thinking. Shortly after becoming a Fed governor in 2002, for example, Mr. Bernanke argued forcefully for tough action to head off a possible epidemic of deflation, or downward spiraling prices. 
 If, as expected, he is approved by the Senate, Mr. Bernanke could face the opposite challenge. Inflation is now heating up for the first time in a decade. The United States has become the world's biggest debtor nation; there is widespread worry about a housing bubble; and American households have reduced their savings rate to nearly zero. 

Weighing a Different Route
 Just months before Mr. Bernanke went to Washington, his life almost took a different route -- into the higher reaches of university administration. He was on the short list of candidates for provost of Princeton, second in command to the university's president. Mr. Bernanke's success as chairman of the economics department for six years had made him a contender. In the end, another faculty star, Amy Gutmann, a political scientist, got the job.
 Some of his friends were not at all enthusiastic about that possible role. ''I talked to him about it, and told him it would be a horrible move, and kept my fingers crossed he would not get it,'' said Mark Gertler, an economist at New York University and Mr. Bernanke's collaborator on various studies.
 As chairman of Princeton's economics department, and also as a member of the board of education in Montgomery Township, N.J., Mr. Bernanke developed a reputation as a skilled negotiator who was expert at forging consensus and maintaining morale -- skills that will be useful in leading the 19 other Fed governors and regional bank presidents who will share with him the task of setting interest rates.
 The school board job drew him into contract negotiations with the teachers, and that experience helped to make him ''politically savvy,'' said Frederic Mishkin, a Columbia University economist and friend.
 ''Many academics when they go into policy jobs are not successful,'' Mr. Mishkin said, ''because they don't know how to talk to nonacademics.''

'Mom, I Can Read This'
 Mr. Bernanke, the oldest of three children, spent only the first four months of his life in his birthplace, Augusta, Ga. His parents, Philip and Edna Bernanke, then moved the new family to Dillon, S.C., a rural town, where Philip became a partner in a pharmacy that his father had established. Their son's precociousness soon showed itself. He started to read while still in kindergarten and, after taking a test, entered the second grade, skipping the first.
 ''He demanded that I read to him all the time,'' his mother, a schoolteacher, said in an interview, ''and all of a sudden he said, 'Mom, I can read this story,' and he started to read the story.''
 In high school, he was an all-A student and capped that performance with a 1,590 out of 1,600 on his college entrance exams, the highest score in the state in 1971. It was an achievement that won him a two-week, all-expenses-paid trip to Europe. 
 He applied to Brandeis University, which was founded by Jews and named after Louis D. Brandeis, the first Jewish justice of the Supreme Court. Harvard, which he ended up attending, was an after-thought. His parents still keep kosher, and their son learned Hebrew partly from a grandfather who lived with the family -- enough Hebrew to officiate at the bar and bat mitzvahs of his children, Joel and Alyssa, without the help of a rabbi.
 The synagogue in Dillon was too small to support a full-time rabbi, so a student rabbi conducted services on the High Holy Days and stayed at the Bernanke home. One evening at dinner, the visitor suggested that Ben apply to Harvard.
 ''We were talking about Brandeis,'' Mrs. Bernanke recalled, ''and the rabbi said, 'If he can get into Brandeis, he can get into Harvard.'''
 Ben Bernanke thought he would major in physics. He soon switched to math, and then to economics, which mixed math and people, as his parents put it. He went from Harvard to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where he received his Ph.D. in 1979, and also married. After graduation, he and his wife, Anna, the daughter of refugees from Europe, moved on to Mr. Bernanke's first teaching post, at Stanford, where they sublet a house with Mr. Gertler and another young economist, both of them bachelors.
 ''His wife was a good sport,'' Mr. Gertler remembered. ''She was there for that first summer with three men. We are like socially awkward academics, not any good in the kitchen, and she cooked for all of us.''

Hard Decisions Ahead
 Succeeding Mr. Greenspan, sometimes called the most successful central banker ever, would not be easy under any circumstances. But the timing of his departure could add an extra degree of difficulty to Mr. Bernanke's ascendancy.
 Mr. Greenspan is scheduled to preside over three more meetings of the Fed committee that sets the benchmark short-term interest rate before he retires at the end of January. Based on the price of a futures contract tied to Fed policy, investors are expecting three more rate increases, pushing the target rate to 4.5 percent from the current 3.75 percent, before the Fed pauses or stops altogether. 
 But that could leave Mr. Bernanke facing a quandary as he takes over at the March 28 meeting. At exactly the moment he is trying to establish himself as an inflation fighter and his independence from the Bush administration, Mr. Bernanke -- if he endorses the pause in raising interest rates that many in the markets expect -- could appear to be moving in the opposite direction.
 ''It's important for the chairman that the Fed doesn't err on inflation, especially at the beginning,'' said Laurence H. Meyer, a former Fed governor and now vice chairman of Macroeconomic Advisers, a forecasting firm. 
 Indeed, in a sign that investors might already be worrying about inflation, the yield on the 10-year Treasury note yesterday rose to its highest level since April. Since Monday morning, when word began circulating that Mr. Bernanke would be named, the yield has risen to 4.53 percent, from 4.38 percent. 
 Mr. Bernanke is very familiar with the problem. As both an academic and former Fed governor, he focused on the importance of the Fed's anti-inflation credibility. 
 ''The benefit of appointing a hawkish central banker,'' he said in a speech last year, ''is the increased inflation-fighting credibility that such an appointment brings.''
 This explained President Jimmy Carter's seemingly incongruous choice of Paul A. Volcker, whose hawkish stance on inflation Mr. Carter did not share and whose moves as Fed chairman hurt his re-election bid, Mr. Bernanke said in the same speech. 
 But Mr. Bernanke's background, as well as the influence he has already had on the Fed, is also likely to ease his transition in other ways. More than anything else, he is known for arguing that the Fed should become more transparent in its decision making.
 ''The more guidance a central bank can provide the public about how policy is likely to evolve,'' Mr. Bernanke said last December, ''the greater the chance that market participants will make appropriate inferences.''
 Mr. Bernanke is fond of using clear metaphors -- like helicopters dropping cash from the sky -- rather than Mr. Greenspan's often abstruse prose. And as a Fed governor from 2002 until this past summer, he pushed his colleagues to give investors, businesses and households a better feel for where policy was headed. 
 This transparency could help him if he does halt the rate increases at his first meeting. Already, the markets seem to expect such a move. ''It's still the institution making these decisions,'' Mr. Mishkin, the Columbia professor, said.
 Perhaps the best way to establish transparency, Mr. Bernanke has written, is to set up an easily understandable process. It is in many ways the opposite of the image that Mr. Greenspan has helped cultivate, that of an oracle.
 ''He will probably work toward depersonalizing monetary policy,'' Mr. Gertler said.
 A useful analogy is to Bill James, the baseball writer whose books Mr. Bernanke has discussed with fellow economists. Mr. James's work, which often argues for statistical analysis over intuition, ''was always a topic of conversation,'' Mr. Gertler said. 
 He remembers Mr. Bernanke's being especially interested in finding statistics that forecast future performance. In the same vein, he has argued that central bankers should rely as much as possible on the enormous amounts of economic data now available and less on hunches.
 ''The hope eventually is to come up with a statistical formula that processes this information and gets the best forecast,'' said Jean Boivin, a Columbia economist who has done research with Mr. Bernanke. ''Once you do that, the question is how much is left over for judgment.''
 But the differences between him and Mr. Greenspan are shades of gray more than anything else, economists say. For all of Mr. Bernanke's sympathy for systematic approaches to policy making, he concedes that a central banker needs to make some judgment calls. 
 Understanding the economic situation is ''analogous, it seems to me, to the efforts of a detective to reconstruct a sequence of events from a range of diverse and subtle clues,'' he said in January. 
 ''Chairman Greenspan,'' Mr. Bernanke added, ''is, of course, a master.''

HEADLINE: In the Border Brutality, Discerning a Bright Side

BYLINE: By Ginger Thompson

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY 

 BODY:
Up in the clouds on the presidential airplane, Vicente Fox summoned the deep, defiant tone of voice that helped bring down seven decades of autocracy to talk about his government's fight against a wave of drug-related violence that has badly shaken the nation's faith in its young democracy.
 ''We are going to win the battle against insecurity,'' he said, pounding his fist on a table. ''It is a frontal war. It is a permanent fight. It is going to take time, but we are going to win.'' 
On the streets below, where the battle the president talked about has set new benchmarks for brutality, signs of imminent victory are hard to see. At 30,000 feet, though, he discovered a silver lining in the clouds of violence. The fight against drugs has become so ugly, he said, because for the first time the fight is for real.
 To the president and high-level law enforcement officials interviewed in recent weeks, the violence is a tough but logical side effect of the progress made in recent years with the arrests of at least a dozen powerful kingpins. And the growing transparency within the government, Mr. Fox added, has weakened the old corrupt networks that allowed the cartels to move through society, and prosper.
 ''We have detained 12 major leaders of organized crime,'' Mr. Fox went on. ''Now there are the 'tigrillos,' the minor, young members of these cartels who are trying to take over the spaces of their bosses, and they are killing each other.''
 Independent analysts and human rights investigators do not disagree with Mr. Fox. Yet while it was his crackdown that set off the wildfire of violence, they say, the government lacks the resources to put it out.
 ''It's as if Fox clubbed a beehive, but didn't think about how he would protect himself from the angry swarms of bees,'' said Jorge Chabat of the prominent Mexican research organization CIDE. ''The state has the capacity to capture drug traffickers, but it does not have the resources to deal with the violence that followed because the police are the same, the prison systems are the same and the rest of the institutions are as weak as ever.''
 The violence has grown most intense in Nuevo Laredo, across the Rio Grande from Laredo, Tex. The bustling commercial center -- more than 60 percent of the trade between the United States and Mexico passes through it -- has in the last year become the murder capital of Mexico's northern frontier, and ground zero in the government's efforts to smash drug cartels.
 More than 130 people have been killed there so far this year, including a city councilman and a police chief gunned down less than seven hours after being sworn in, as drug traffickers fight for control of the lucrative transportation routes that run through Nuevo Laredo onto Texas Interstate 35. That is more than twice the number of people slain in Nuevo Laredo last year. But the number of killings is not what has alarmed people across the country as much as the style and duration of the violence.
 At the end of a recent interview, Deputy Attorney General Jose Luis Santiago Vasconcelos showed a videotape of a shooting in Nuevo Laredo last summer. Automatic machine-gun fire lasted for seven full minutes on a main avenue of the city. The camera captured exploding cars and images of bodies turned to ashes and bone.
 ''It could be Baghdad,'' Mr. Vasconcelos said. ''This is truly a war.''
 When pressed for evidence that Mexico is winning this war, law enforcement authorities talked about the tens of thousands of drug dealers they have put behind bars, the hundreds of suspicious police officers and prison guards dismissed from duty and the thousands of federal police officers and soldiers sent to patrol cities all along the border.
 But the killings not only continue, they have spread from Nuevo Laredo to the Pacific Coast, which federal authorities consider the main landing area for drug shipments from Central America. Investigators like Omar Muniz, of the Center for Border Studies and the Promotion of Human Rights, said that with only a handful of the investigations into the drug killings leading to arrests, impunity remains the rule. And when local police officers in Nuevo Laredo continue to earn less than $700 a month, he said, they remain easily corruptible. 
 ''Our task is very difficult,'' the attorney general, Daniel Cabeza de Vaca, acknowledged in an interview. ''Neither us nor anyone else in the world is going to be able to compete with the drug traffickers' power to corrupt. It is their greatest weapon.''
 Scholars like Mr. Chabat suggested there might be one greater. It is impossible to understand the power of drug trafficking in Mexico, he wrote recently, without understanding the ''unholy alliance'' between the state and organized crime.
 It is an alliance, Mr. Chabat wrote in the magazine Letras Libres, that is based partly on corruption and partly on the incapacity of this country's weak institutions to fight organized crime. But it is also driven by the vast economic benefits that come with drug trafficking. The illegal industry, he said, creates jobs, supports political campaigns, builds highways and industrial parks and brings badly needed services to some of the poorest communities.
 ''That does not mean that there exists a policy to foment drug trafficking to attract the capital it produces,'' Mr. Chabat added, ''but there are real incentives that go beyond corruption, that stop authorities from fighting it.''
 On the president's plane, Mr. Fox vowed his government would not back down from the fight. But he also conceded that there were forces beyond his government's control that made it hard to defeat the cartels completely. Perhaps the most powerful, he said, was the demand for drugs from this country's wealthy neighbor to the north.
 ''What happens to all the drugs that enter the United States?'' he said. ''What happens to all the criminals in the United States who distribute and sell drugs? What happens to those who launder money, and then that money comes back to Mexico to bribe and corrupt our police?''

HEADLINE: U.S., France and Britain Join To Press Syrians at the U.N.

BYLINE: By WARREN HOGE

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Oct. 25 

 BODY:
The United States and France circulated a draft Security Council resolution Tuesday evening ordering Syria to cooperate with the United Nations investigation of the assassination of former Prime Minister Rafik Hariri of Lebanon and threatening sanctions if it did not. 
 The measure, cosponsored by Britain, also called for people identified as being involved in the killing or its planning to be subject to an international travel ban and assets freeze. 
 Under the terms of the resolution, Syria must take into custody and make available to the United Nations investigators officials and others whom they suspect of involvement in the killing. Failure to do so could make Syria liable to economic and diplomatic sanctions, the resolution said.
 The measure followed the publication last week of the investigation's preliminary report, which implicated high-ranking Syrian security officials in the car-bomb killing of Mr. Hariri on Feb. 14. He had roused the anger of Damascus by contesting its continued dominance of Lebanese politics, and his assassination prompted immediate suspicions in Beirut that Syria was behind it.
 The report also accused the Syrians of not cooperating with the investigators and of supplying misleading information.
 Hours before the circulation of the draft, the chief investigator, the German prosecutor Detlev Mehlis, formally presented the report to the Security Council and told members that Syria must provide him ''greater and meaningful cooperation'' so he could complete his work.
 Mr. Mehlis also said that there had been a number of ''credible'' threats against him and his 30-member team of international investigators and that they would need greater security. 
 Mr. Mehlis said he and his team would continue investigating until the expiration of his commission's mandate on Dec. 15. 
 ''The commission is of the view that this would provide yet another opportunity for the Syrian authorities to show greater and meaningful cooperation and to provide any relevant substantial evidence on the assassination,'' he said.
 He said the Syrians should carry out their own investigation ''in an open and transparent manner.''
 ''This would enable the commission to 'fill in the gaps' and to have a clearer picture about the organizers and perpetrators of the crime,'' he said. 
 The Security Council has scheduled a meeting on Syria next Monday to be attended by the member states' foreign ministers. John R. Bolton, the United States ambassador, said he hoped a final resolution would be ready by then.
 At the Council, Boutros Assaker, the secretary general of the Lebanese Foreign Ministry, said his country was ''pleased with the content'' of the report. ''Uncovering the truth and punishing all the murderers and the establishment of justice helps to enhance the security and stability in Lebanon and throughout the region,'' he said.
 But Syria's ambassador, Fayssal Mekdad, said accusations of obstructionism against his country were ''a great injustice to Syria,'' which he said was the ''prime victim of the crime'' and had always demonstrated a willingness to ''cooperate faithfully and sincerely'' with the commission. He said Syria would continue to provide the commission with any information it requested.
 Mr. Mekdad quoted President Bashar al-Assad of Syria as saying: ''Syria is innocent of this crime. Syria is ready and willing to put to trial any Syrian conclusively implicated in that crime.''
 While demanding more cooperation from the Syrians, Mr. Mehlis commended Lebanese security and justice authorities for helping his commission and noted that they had worked ''in tandem'' with his people in conducting raids on Aug. 30 that led to the arrests of four former senior security officials as suspects in the killing.
 The resolution directed Syria to cease any interference in the domestic affairs of Lebanon and to renounce all support for all forms of terrorist action and all assistance to terrorist groups. The United States accuses Syria of backing guerrilla groups that attack Israelis and of facilitating the passage of insurgents across its border with Iraq.
 Mr. Bolton was asked if he worried about the possibility of vetoes from countries like Russia and China that traditionally resist sanctions resolutions, and he said the three sponsors of the resolution had talked with every country on the Council. ''We will work to get the broadest support we can,'' he said.

HEADLINE: In Syria, Doubt About Leaders' Version of Lebanon Killing

BYLINE: By MICHAEL SLACKMAN; Mona el-Naggar and Katherine Zoepf contributed reporting for this article.

DATELINE: DAMASCUS, Syria, Oct. 25 

 BODY:
On the day that the United Nations Security Council began discussing the investigation of the assassination of the former Lebanese prime minister Rafik Hariri, Syrians awoke to familiar newspaper headlines -- ''Israeli Officials: Changing the Regime in Syria Is in American-Israeli Interests.''
 It was the kind of headline that at another time might have prompted people to nod in agreement, to view the troubles afflicting this nation as the work of an American-Zionist plot. But the leadership's standard defensive posture did not seem to be working, not this time. 
''When there is a big crisis, they don't say the regime is under attack, they say the country is,'' said Michel Kilo, an opposition leader. ''This time people are saying it is the regime that is accused.''
 While the world waits for the final assessment of the United Nations prosecutor, Detlev Mehlis, this capital has become a place of frayed nerves, frozen plans and a widespread sense of bewilderment that may well rival the shock of losing to Israel in the 1973 Arab-Israeli war.
 Political analysts, academics and students all said in interviews that they had believed, or at least wanted to believe, their government's initial insistence on Syria's innocence. 
 Now, with the prosecutor pointing a finger at President Bashar al-Assad's inner circle -- his brother-in-law, Asef Shawkat, the head of military intelligence, and his brother, Maher Assad, commander of the presidential guard -- many people here are not buying the government efforts to paint the report as a political smear orchestrated by the West. 
 ''The government insinuated the report would not implicate Syria,'' said a middle-aged writer who spoke on condition that he not be identified, for fear that he and his family would face repercussions from the government security forces. ''There is a sense of shock now. The people are all surprised.''
 The shock has come at a cost. On Thursday, the day the Mehlis report came out, the Syrian pound lost 3 percent of its value against the dollar, economists said. Business and political leaders say many people stopped spending, instead looking to convert their cash into hard currency in case there is a crisis.
 In a stroke, hopes evaporated that Syria could attract the foreign investment to help pump life into an economy that has withered under decades of central planning and corruption. People with the means to leave have begun talking about fleeing and waiting out the crisis before returning, many people said.
 Five years ago, when President al-Assad came to power, there was hope he would be able to push through political and economic changes that would open up the country and improve lives. Under his father, Hafez Assad, Syria was a police state with multiple security agencies, each set up to keep an eye on the people -- and on one another.
 Now people are seeing the modest freedoms they enjoyed rolled back, and they are concerned that if the government falls there will be civil war. The last so-called democracy forum, in which people were allowed to gather in a home to discuss political ideas, was closed a few months ago, and the first few semi-independent newspapers were also shut down. 
 ''In the street this morning they followed me,'' said Ayman Abdel Nour, a reform-minded member of the ruling Baath Party, implying that he was followed by members of the security forces. ''This is new.''
 In a small downtown restaurant called Maraya, tables were crowded with people who had gathered at 5:30 p.m. to break their fast, part of the observance of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan. The mood was somber as people listened to news about the Mehlis report.
 ''You can sense the fear and tension,'' said Khalid Omar, a fifth-year engineering student, who said few people were accepting the government's case that this was all a big setup. ''We see the news, and the newspapers and TV, but now even the non-educated people analyze things. People are not that dumb. Everyone analyzes things, so they don't buy everything they see or read.''
 Even when the government tried to orchestrate a huge rally on Monday, sending schoolchildren and civil servants out into the streets to show support for Mr. Assad, the numbers were relatively small.
 That is a big change from just a few months ago, when Syria was forced to withdraw its security and military forces from Lebanon. ''People felt humiliated'' then and turned out in large numbers to demonstrate, Mr. Abdel Nour said. But on Monday, he said, ''people were not out protesting to back the regime.''
 If there is one trait common in the Middle East, it is that people often rely on dark humor to help deal with difficult circumstances.
 In the weeks after the Hariri assassination, there was a joke going around Damascus about a water pump that broke in a small Berber community in Morocco. The villagers gathered around the broken pump and immediately arrived at a solution: Blame the Syrians! 
 But the well of jokes has been running dry in recent days, Syrians say. 
 ''It just isn't funny any longer,'' said Shorash Miro, a civil engineering student at Aleppo University. ''The situation for Syria is very bad. Everyone is watching TV or reading the news on the Internet. They're not laughing any longer.
 ''This morning when I went to my lecture at the university, the professor entered the hall without speaking and without looking at any of us. He was completely silent for two or three minutes. Then suddenly he looked at us and said, 'Mr. Mehlis says to you, good morning.'''

HEADLINE: Future Shock at The Fed

BYLINE: By James Grant. 
James Grant, the editor of Grant's Interest Rate Observer, is the author of ''John Adams: Party of One.''

 BODY:
PRESIDENT BUSH's choice to succeed Alan Greenspan as chairman of the Federal Reserve Board has raised a roar of approval. Economist, scholar, presidential counselor and former Fed governor, Ben S. Bernanke is a nominee from central casting. 
 But there is one rub. The man with the gray beard and the perfect resume -- winner of the South Carolina state spelling bee, Ph.D. from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, former chairman of the Princeton economics department -- professes to believe the impossible. He insists that the Fed can keep the economy chugging and prices stable just by pushing a single interest rate (the so-called federal funds rate) up and down.
Alan Greenspan, of course, has long espoused the same impossibility, as have other Federal Reserve officials and many private economists. A little thought experiment will reveal their error.
 Let us say that Mr. Bernanke's field of expertise was energy prices rather than interest rates, and that the president named him to the Department of Energy rather than the Federal Reserve. If Mr. Bernanke then ventured a long-term oil-price forecast, would anyone even bother to write it down? Would anyone expect him, once confirmed, to actually fix the price? 
 Those who did would have to call the idea by its discredited name -- price controls -- and would have to explain why the secretary-designate knew better than the market at which price the supply of oil would meet the demand for oil. They would also have to explain why this episode in price controls would turn out better than the long series of flops that preceded it. The world would laugh. 
 Yet we seem to accept, and even desire, exactly such ludicrous claims of foresight from a Fed chairman. It follows that anyone who is willing to take the job as Fed chief is, by that reason, unqualified to hold it. 
 Wall Street, of course, has other ideas. Thus the rally in stock prices following word of Mr. Bernanke's nomination was no vote of confidence that the presumptive chairman would settle on the right, or true, federal funds rate. It was, rather, an expression of hope that he would do his all to ensure a speculatively appropriate (meaning very, very low) rate. 
 Perhaps. But Mr. Bernanke's history shows he is not so much a believer in easy money as in the capacity of the Fed to take the right anticipatory action. Is the rate of inflation too high? Not high enough? With a twist of the monetary-policy dial, the problem is on its way to being solved. Let the Fed announce its target for inflation -- say, 2 percent a year -- and juggle its interest rate to cause that desired inflation rate to materialize. In so many words, the nominee contends, policymakers control events, rather than the other way around. 
 We are all susceptible to believing an impossible thing. Mr. Bernanke has the special susceptibility of the straight-A student. The economic world he sees is his to command. He can comprehend it, even measure it (no small achievement given the subjective, even arbitrary, nature of statistical sampling and compilation). And he expresses his supreme self-confidence in some of the bluntest language ever spoken by a central banker. 
 Late in 2002, the Fed started to warn against the risk of deflation, that is, of broadly falling prices. Now, deflation is no bad thing if you find yourself at the cash register with a shopping cart full of groceries. But Mr. Bernanke did not have the shopper exclusively in mind. ''When inflation is already low and the fundamentals of the economy suddenly deteriorate,'' he said in a speech that November, ''the central bank should act more pre-emptively and more aggressively than usual in cutting rates.'' 
 Some modicum of inflation is a must, he said. Let prices start to sag, and they could go right on sagging, as they had done in Japan for years. The solution: print money. The counterarguments for sitting tight (Are not falling prices a natural and, on balance, benign consequence of the incorporation of China and India into the global economy? By printing extra money to prop up the American inflation rate, wouldn't the Fed distort a whole host of prices and interest rates?) found no sympathy with him or Mr. Greenspan. 
 So Mr. Bernanke, then one of seven Federal Reserve governors, sought to assure the world that United States monetary policy would stop deflation before it started. Yet here was a tricky assignment, for the post-1971 dollar is purely faith-based. Not since the Nixon years has a holder of dollars had the privilege of exchanging them for a statutory weight of gold. Rather, the dollar is a piece of paper, or electronic impulse, of no intrinsic value. It is legal tender whose value is ultimately determined by the confidence of the people who hold it. 
 In the Greenspan era, the United States became an immense net debtor. A prudent American central banker, it might seem, would therefore be at pains to spare these overseas accumulators of greenbacks any unnecessary anxiety about inflation damaging the shelf life of their money. Not Mr. Bernanke. In that 2002 speech, he said that because the currency is intrinsically worthless, the government can (and in certain circumstances should) print up as much of it as it wants. And it should not be stymied in the work of restoring the rate of inflation to a decent minimum even if interest rates fell to zero. 
 The Fed could, if necessary, buy up all the Treasury's debt, using dollars created specially for the purpose. Or, for a double-barrel stimulus, it could also buy up private debts (mortgages, car loans, bonds and the like). And as a last resort, the Fed could figuratively put in place an idea that the economist Milton Friedman once theorized for illustrative purposes: It could drop money out of helicopters. Approbation for Mr. Bernanke is not quite universal on Wall Street; after that speech some took to mockingly calling him ''Helicopter Ben.'' 
 Many were the blessings, real and imagined, of the Greenspan era: low inflation, falling interest rates in a growing economy, a pair of notably mild recessions and a succession of financial crises nipped in the bud by an activist Federal Reserve. Stock prices were bubbly (until the bubble burst), and Wall Street prospered. But debt grew and grew, and the gulf between what the United States consumes and what it produces -- the trade deficit -- widened to break all records. 
 Now Mr. Bernanke stands to inherit what Mr. Greenspan and he, among others at the Fed, wrought. Certainly they have whipped deflation. But by pressing down interest rates to the floor, they have pushed housing prices to the sky. And they are the uneasy witnesses to an unscripted climb in the Consumer Price Index, which, in September, registered a 4.7 percent increase over last year.
 Don't worry, many counsel. The seemingly alarming inflation data are the statistical tracks of a boom in energy prices caused by the Iraq war and the Gulf Coast hurricanes. It will pass. 
 But what if it doesn't? What if a new cycle of rising prices has already begun -- as I happen to believe it has? Mr. Bernanke, as sure of himself as he is of the future, won't soon be changing the way the Fed operates. Rather, it will be the world's dollar holders who will change the way they operate. 
 If America's creditors sense that inflation is robbing them of their wealth and that the Bernanke Fed is too slow to raise its interest rate, they will sell their dollars and dollar-denominated securities. Such an exodus would, among other things, tend to increase the costs of imported goods and drive up dollar-denominated interest rates. In other words, events would control the Fed. 
 Since each of the world's major currencies is a scrap of paper of no intrinsic value, some of these disaffected dollar investors may buy gold. Mr. Bernanke doesn't talk much about that barbarous relic. What would he make of a flight from a rationally managed currency into an inert precious metal? I will guess that it would astonish him.

HEADLINE: Carleton Fiorina Joins the Board Of a Big Data Security Company

BYLINE: By ERIC DASH

 BODY:
Carleton S. Fiorina is joining the board of a closely held computer security company, Cybertrust, in one of her first moves since being forced from the helm of Hewlett-Packard. 
 Ms. Fiorina, 51, who was one of the most prominent women and charismatic leaders in American business, has kept a low profile since being ousted by the board of Hewlett in February. She was credited with being a brilliant saleswoman but was criticized for the $19 billion acquisition of Compaq Computer in 2002 that failed to deliver the results she promised. Since her departure, Ms. Fiorina has given several speeches and has said she is looking for a job.
''I've been working on my resume,'' she jokingly told graduates of the North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University during a commencement address last spring. ''I've been lining up my references. I bought a new interview suit.'' She was reported to be on a short list of candidates to head the World Bank. (The job ultimately went to Paul D. Wolfowitz, the former deputy secretary of defense.)
 Cybertrust, based in Herndon, Va., is among the largest information security companies in the world. It has been called in to investigate the data breach at CardSystems, the credit card processor that left the account information of more than 40 million cardholders exposed to fraud.
 Ms. Fiorina, who owns a home in the Washington area, expressed interest in the information security industry to friends who work as venture capitalists. They arranged for a meeting with Cybertrust's management over the summer. After spending a few days visiting the company, she accepted an invitation to join the board. Her compensation was not disclosed. Cybertrust executives said they hoped they would be able to take advantage of her extensive industry contacts and her experience in leading Hewlett. 
 ''We are trying to sell high into large organizations, and security compliance has become a boardroom discussion,'' said John C. Becker, Cybertrust's chief executive. ''Being an ex-C.E.O. of a major organization, she understands the issues.''
 Ms. Fiorina's appointment is the second board position she has accepted this year. In early September, she was named a director at Revolution Health Group, a venture formed by Steve Case, the former chairman of AOL Time Warner. Besides Mr. Case, who stepped down under pressure from shareholders in January 2003, the board includes Franklin D. Raines, who resigned as Fannie Mae's chairman and chief executive after accounting problems at the mortgage giant were disclosed last year, and Steve Wiggins, who was forced out as chairman of Oxford Health Plans in 1998. 
 Colin L. Powell, who stepped down as secretary of state at the end of 2004, and Jim Barksdale, who was the chief executive of Netscape until it was bought by America Online, are also on the board.

HEADLINE: House Approves Overhaul at Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac

BYLINE: By STEPHEN LABATON

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 26 

 BODY:
Responding to the accounting scandals at Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the House of Representatives approved legislation on Wednesday overhauling the regulatory oversight of the two huge mortgage financing companies.
 The legislation, approved by a lopsided vote of 331 to 90, would create a new regulator for the Federal Home Loan Banks and for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, companies formally known as government-sponsored enterprises. The new agency, the Federal Housing Finance Agency, would be financed through assessments on the banks and companies. It would have the authority to set capital requirements, reject new business products being offered by the companies and limit their portfolio holdings.
''What we enable with the passage of this bill is the creation of an independent regulator with all the tools necessary to protect the taxpayer,'' said Representative Richard H. Baker, a Louisiana Republican who is the chief sponsor of the bill. ''This is a fair compromise.'' 
 But the measure was sharply criticized by the Bush administration and differs significantly from legislation moving through the Senate.
 Even as they have weathered financial scandals and management shakeouts, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, along with their political allies in Congress and the mortgage and construction industries, continue to exert considerable political influence on the legislation. 
 They soundly defeated one attempt to eliminate Fannie's and Freddie's ability to borrow money from the federal Treasury and a second amendment that would have given their new regulator greater authority. They also saved a provision that would give them the ability to provide financing for larger and more lucrative loans. 
 By a voice vote, the House also approved an amendment supported by Fannie and Freddie and opposed by the Bush administration that would continue letting the White House select a number of board members. In the past, investors have inferred that such political appointments mean that the federal government will rescue Fannie and Freddie in case of default. It is that belief that has enabled Fannie and Freddie to pay lower interest rates on their bonds than most other companies pay. 
 The legislation now awaits action by the full Senate, which is not expected before next year. Last July, the Senate banking committee approved a similar measure on a vote along party lines.
 Differences between the House and Senate versions, however, could doom the legislation if not reconciled. The Senate bill would require the companies to slowly divest most of their $1.5 trillion investment portfolios. The House bill leaves portfolio limits to the discretion of the new Federal Housing Finance Agency.
 Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have lobbied against the imposition of such limits, particularly since their portfolios account for most of their earnings.
 The strict limits on portfolio size in the Senate version have been sought by the Bush administration and by Alan Greenspan, who is stepping down soon as chairman of the Federal Reserve. Mr. Greenspan and administration officials have said that the enormous portfolios of the companies -- nearly a quarter of the home mortgage market -- posed significant risks to the nation's financial system should either company face major problems. 
 The White House issued a statement on Wednesday criticizing the legislation adopted by the House, saying it envisioned a regulatory regime that ''is considerably weaker than that which governs other large, complex financial institutions.''
 The legislation ''fails to include key elements that are essential to protect the safety and soundness of the housing finance system and the broader financial system at large,'' the White House statement said.
 Ben S. Bernanke, who has been selected by President Bush to succeed Mr. Greenspan, has not publicly taken a position on the regulation of the mortgage financing companies.
 The Senate bill, unlike the House bill, would not establish a new affordable housing fund. Administration officials also oppose such a fund because, they say, it could lead to increased risk-taking.
 The House bill, unlike the Senate measure, would let Fannie and Freddie enter the jumbo mortgage market by raising the limit on loans that they could purchase from banks and other mortgage lenders. 
 Currently, Fannie and Freddie are able to purchase loans for mortgages up to $359,000 this year and $400,000 next year. The House bill would raise that amount to $600,000 in many markets. By a vote of 358 to 57, the House defeated an amendment proposed by Representative E. Scott Garrett, Republican of New Jersey, to strike the increase in the loan limit.
 The House bill sets aside 3.5 percent to 5 percent of the company's profits over the next five years for grants to build low-income housing. But a provision inserted in the bill at the 11th hour to assuage conservative Republicans provoked considerable debate because it would prohibit any group that engages in voter mobilization efforts from applying for grants. 
 The provision was opposed by more than 600 nonprofit and faith-based groups, including the National Urban League, Catholic Social Services, the N.A.A.C.P. and the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights. They said the provision was unconstitutional, contending that it interfered with voter registration efforts, and undermined the purpose of creating the housing fund.
 ''Under the Republican provision, you can't do get-out-the-vote efforts if you work in affordable housing,'' said Representative Barney Frank of Massachusetts, the senior Democrat on the House Financial Services Committee. ''There is an extremism here that is not comprehensible except if you know the history.''
 ''It has always been clear that the money can only be spent on affordable housing,'' Mr. Frank said of the housing grants.
 Representative John Lewis, the Georgia Democrat who became a national figure for his leading role in civil rights struggles of the 1960's, concurred.
 ''I can't believe this is happening in 2005,'' he said. ''This is not 1964. This is not 1965. What we are saying is our own people, churches, synagogues, cannot participate in nonpartisan voter registration drives. What are we saying to the world? This provision will take us back to the dark past. We can do better, much better.''
 But the Republicans disagreed, saying the provision would insulate the money from being used for political purposes.
 ''This provides accountability for where the money goes,'' said Representative Michael G. Oxley of Ohio, the chairman of the House Financial Services Committee and a main sponsor of the legislation. ''We want to make certain that every dollar we make available goes for housing.''
 Mr. Baker said that for those groups who want to apply for grants and are also politically involved, ''They will have to make a choice.''

HEADLINE: At Furniture Fair, Quiet Reflections and Slowing Sales

BYLINE: By BRADFORD McKEE

DATELINE: High Point, N.C. 

 BODY:
FANTASY takes a furniture hunter only so far. In the vast maze of showrooms at the International Home Furnishings Market (12 million square feet in 188 buildings), which ended its fall run here yesterday, furniture makers spun sugary marketing reveries around their chairs, sofas or tea tables to make the merchandise seem desirable to the retail buyers passing through. 
 Mainstream furniture shoppers may need a little fantasy to loosen their wallets, but furniture makers themselves are staring at rude realities these days. Prices for raw materials such as foam and fabrics, not to mention the costs of freight, have risen sharply in recent weeks. Furniture sales are down this year, and retailers, who report big backlogs of products they can't sell, wonder where anybody finds a place to sit in such a hot housing market. The answer: Probably on the old stuff, which is looking good to consumers who may be mortgaged to the hilt and concerned more about the economy, the cost of fuel and vicious hurricanes than about redecorating.
 Even before the storms hit, said Jerry Epperson, a furniture industry analyst with the investment banking firm of Mann, Armistead & Epperson, ''2005 was a disappointing and frustrating year.'' Sales increased by 4.3 percent in the first half of 2005 over that of 2004, he said, compared with 7.9 percent a year earlier. 
 Margaret Russell, editor in chief of Elle Decor, noted the event's subdued atmosphere. ''It was a quiet market,'' she said, ''and given the state of the economy, I think that's perfectly understandable.'' 
 Slower sales and, as people here constantly noted, the competition from a big new furniture market that opened this summer in Las Vegas, may have contributed to the noticeably thinner crowds in showrooms and on the streets. Judy Mendenhall, the president of the High Point International Home Furnishings Market Authority, said attendance figures were not yet available, but said showrooms had reported traffic down by about 10 percent over recent markets. Some smaller retailers seemed to have stayed home to mind their stores. And furniture makers are left to think of what more they could do to attract business.
 Perhaps they could do less -- as in less fantasy marketing, for instance. A number of new furniture lines at this market stood out by trading fancy escapist promises for sobriety, restraint and practicality in pieces that could speak clearly for themselves. 
 Of those pieces, not all came devoid of narrative, but they tended to be engrossing. Hickory Chair (hickorychair.com), an old North Carolina brand, went to a marquee name in American furniture connoisseurship, Albert Sack, and asked him to help derive a line from his favorite antiques. He did so with more sense than sentimentality.
 The piece de resistance of the collection, the Maryland High Chest ($7,980), which towers at nearly 80 inches high, copies a classic work dating to around 1800. Its clean profile and geometric patterns suggest an early modernist rebellion in America against the more elaborate Europeans of the day. At a smaller scale, the collection includes the New York Candlestand table ($1,050), which is 27 inches high with three legs, a minimally turned pedestal and a burst of striped mahogany on top. 
 Radically, and unlike most old-school furniture makers here, Hickory Chair no longer presents its new lines in neatly matching sets. ''We've started showing people you don't need to be modern or traditional, but you can mix them,'' said Jay Reardon, the company's president. Its showroom groupings combine pieces of disparate periods and personalities to offer more than a few ways to look at its product lines. 
 If customers are turned off by one piece of a matching line, the thinking goes, then they are likely to reject the line entirely. Matching suites work best when they have enough minor variations in details to show a family resemblance rather than monotony. A good example was the Fly line by the Italian company Arte Brotto (www.artebrotto.it), a sleek new line of wall cabinets, credenzas and tables that walk a studied line between classic and contemporary phrasing.
 ''The furniture flies on the wall,'' said Luisa Brotto, the company's representative, by way of explaining the line's name.
 ''Floats'' might be more apt, but the woodwork's quality loses nothing in translation. With solid sides of golden European cherry wood (no veneers), the modular cabinets and shelves scarcely differ but for the bronze-ish leather covering one set of credenza doors, which also happened to have the most tenderly bowed fronts at this market. The prices run between $7,000 and $8,000 for that one and other large cabinets, but with the small, smoked-steel tongues as drawer pulls, the design was almost certainly one of a kind.
 Quiet details are hard to find in the mass market -- manufacturers seem to think the masses don't miss them. The slightest brass strips on a mahogany klismos chair ($950) at Bolier & Company (bolierco.com) begin to decode a new collection by the designer John Black, called Neos, which supplies a modern answer to Regency lust.
 The Neos line observes the purity of furniture from that period, and then some: King George IV's loyal artisans would have approved of a bar table, veneered in Mozambique with x-braced bronze legs set in a campaign spirit ($2,400), because they probably drank their share. But they would have had to concede that the fold-open well inside the top, lined with a waterproof laminate, has gone them one better. Bolier, which was started in 2002 by Christian G. Plasman, a former president of Baker Furniture, seems to have found a foothold in part by cleaning up 19th-century classics as Baker is known to do, and with quality and prices that are on par. 
 At more populist prices -- not to say cheap -- there were shades of the mid-20th century creeping in, and some of it was convincing. At Lights Up! (lightsup.info), the designer Rachel Simon introduced a line of pendant drum lamps, called Kimono, in a patterned silk designed by Thomas Fernez. ''It comes from an old kimono, and we blew it up,'' Ms. Simon said. The three-tiered drum version ($300) has silhouettes that suggest classic Art Deco; table lamps in a companion set sit on delicate tripods (the large version is $250; the smaller, $180). Martha Stewart revealed a soft spot for casual early and midcentury design in a new line called Opal Point, her fourth with Bernhardt Furniture (bernhardt.com). 
 The collection's centerpiece, a bar cabinet called Larkspur ($1,450) of dark primavera wood with doors inlaid with strips of nickel, looks far more glamorous than anything in Ms. Stewart's previous lines based on her homes in the Northeast. For one thing, it has a mirrored inside. 
 In a more modest mood, the Pengrove desk chair ($660) puts a mahogany finish on a rubberwood frame, with faceted, tapered legs topped by a dart detail that asks to be overlooked; it was shown upholstered in a gunmetal shade of velvet, and the seat was softly padded without fluff.
 Fantasy took a holiday at the showroom of Mitchell Gold + Bob Williams (mgandbw.com). Every season, this design house turns out tons of new pieces with a seasoned pop sensibility and names many of them as if they were children -- so many that they must surely live in a shoe. 
 So what to do? There are many possibilities. Mssrs. Gold and Williams rolled out sofas with seats 45 inches deep for slouching. They had stiff-spined ''conversation'' chairs to promote good posture. And there was the deeply tufted leather library chair, the Earl ($1,495), as cozy as sitting on someone's lap. The armless Brady sectional ($1,495), 90 inches long, hasa tight profile, almost no embellishment and it bends, but just barely, at its two-thirds point, like a boomerang. That sense of control extended to the company's lighting, especially the Sela glass table lamp ($169), a 27-inch-high clear teardrop with a white drum shade. No words and no tickets to paradise. It's that easy.

HEADLINE: Formal Portraits Dress Down

BYLINE: By GINIA BELLAFANTE

 BODY:
AMONG the works in the online portfolio of a New York-based portrait artist named Gerald Slater is a commissioned oil painting, 22 by 28 inches in dimension, titled ''Eric at the Window.'' A shaggy-haired boy of about 5 or 6, Eric is shown wearing a plaid shirt and denim overalls. His head tilted, he looks skeptically at the viewer while his tiny hands grab at the window frame, as if to suggest that Eric has had quite enough of bedtime and root vegetables and is preparing to relocate. 
 A 13-year-old boy depicted in one of Marina Goldberg's recent oil portraits appears more at ease with his domestic arrangement. Slouched in a black leather chair with a towel draped behind him, he seems to have wrested himself out of a long shower in time to watch ''South Park.'' His presentation, like Eric's, had none of the eternizing formality of traditional painted portraits. Instead of a brass-buttoned blazer, say, the boy is wearing jeans, his right hand is tucked into a pocket, and a short-sleeve button-down shirt is open to reveal a white T-shirt bearing the Champion sporting goods insignia. He could not be confused with a child of the 19th century; he would probably not be confused with a boy of 1992.
Americans' interest in commissioned portraiture -- in oil, charcoal and pastel -- has marched on unabated since the 1980's, when a new culture of wealth and traditionalism and a renewed interest in figurative painting brought it back into vogue. But a new style of family portraiture has emerged; not, it seems, in reaction against the grilled-cheese-in-hand temporality of pictures taken with cellphones, but in mirrored accord with it. 
 A survey of the genre yields a great number of images of young children and teenagers surrounded by the paraphernalia of their extracurricular lives -- soccer balls, bass guitars, fishing rods -- and outfitted in T-shirts, Converse basketball shoes, Ugg boots, little sneakers with Velcro closures, Polo logos and all variants of the hiking shoe. 
 If commissioned portraiture in the 18th and 19th centuries and much of the 20th was intended to idealize children, the current style seems to idealize the parents who raise them, romanticizing in particular the modern impulse to free children from any hindrances to their self-expression.
 ''We are so anxious now to see our children as individuals, to listen to them, to really hear what they have to say, and I think that's all playing out here,'' said Wende Caporale, a children's portrait artist in North Salem, N.Y., who is considered a leader in the field.
 The casual style has its roots partly in the changing economics of an art form that has been significantly democratized. In the late 1970's and 1980's a handful of agencies sprang up in the North and the Southeast, with the goal of matching portrait artists with prospective clients. A mother in Wichita who wished to have her daughter's likeness rendered was no longer dependent on the one or two portraitists in her immediate vicinity. She could contact a brokerage house that might send an artist from Dallas or Atlanta best suited to her tastes and budget. A broader price structure eventually emerged (prices have typically ranged from $4,500 to $50,000, but it is now possible to find portraits for $1,500 to $2,000), allowing portraiture to extend its reach beyond the precincts of the ancestrally wealthy, to teachers and insurance people, to occupants of exurban McMansions and, in recent years, to those of comparatively more modest means.
 ''The biggest change in the past 10 years has been the increase in the number of middle-income people wanting portraits,'' said Jean Daniel, president of Portraits South, a brokerage in Raleigh, N.C.
 ''I've had couples who don't have dining room furniture but would have a portrait done of their 4-year-old,'' said Gordon Wetmore, chairman of the Portrait Society of America. 
 The fashion for lax dress codes and comfortable settings has also taken hold among the well-to-do. For the past two years Ms. Caporale has been working on the portraits of Kathryn and Elsie Widing, the teenage daughters of Eric P. Widing, the head of the American paintings department at Christie's. On a recent day off, Kathryn, 15, traveled for one of her final sittings from a boarding school in New Jersey to Ms. Caporale's carriage house in North Salem, the home she shares with her husband, Daniel Green, who is among the country's most prominent portrait artists. 
 Like most portraitists, Ms. Caporale works from life and from photographs. Kathryn's portrait, near completion, depicts her by a stream in her parents' former backyard, wearing jeans, a hot pink sweater, a digital watch and a long striped wool scarf. Her family's golden retriever, Jester, is at her side. The composition and costuming in her sister's portrait is almost precisely the same.
 ''One of the things I was trying to replicate was the naturalness and ease of the girls,'' Mr. Widing explained. ''We wanted to capture them really as they are, and painting captures something far more powerful than any photograph can aspire to.''
 The depiction of children in ordinary circumstances has some precedent in American portrait painting. While dress was typically formal, outdoor settings were popular until the Civil War. Mary Cassatt painted children nude or in nightclothes. In the early 1950's Fairfield Porter painted a portrait of his son playing the piano in jeans and high-top sneakers.
 To a great extent, though, the classic children's portraits of John Singer Sargent and other turn-of-the-century artists were meant to denote the status of the families who commissioned them. Today's portraits, with their meticulous attention to branding and everyday detail, seem intended to convey something else, a will toward commonality. 
 In thinking about these new portraits, Barbara Gallati, who curated the show ''Great Expectations: John Singer Sargent Painting Children'' at the Brooklyn Museum last year, is reminded of a portrait presented in 2000 to the Queen Mother that showed the young princes in unceremonious poses and clothes. 
 ''There's some embarrassment in modern society of having too much money, and if you present yourself as having money this way, you open yourself up to a certain kind of criticism,'' she said.
 What there is little embarrassment about in modern society is heaping attention on children. One common feature of contemporary family portraiture, Angela Mack, chief curator of the Gibbes Museum of Art in Charleston, S.C., points out, is the general absence of adults. Children generally consume the frame.
 Perhaps it is not surprising at a time when two television series are devoted to the subject of infertility that a portrait may also be a testament to a child hard won. 
 Not long ago Daniel Arredondo, an artist and dentist in San Antonio, was asked to paint a portrait of a 6-month-old. Dr. Arredondo, who once painted a portrait of Henry G. Cisneros, the former secretary of housing and urban development, and his grandson, balked because babies cannot, of course, sit still. But the mother insisted, he said. She worked as a medical technician, taking sonogram pictures. She had been told she could never have children. This, as he put it, was her miracle baby.

HEADLINE: Of Hockey Players and Housing Prices

BYLINE: By Robert H. Frank. 
Robert H. Frank has been teaching introductory economics at Cornell University since 1972. He is the co-author, with Ben S. Bernanke, of ''Principles of Microeconomics.''

 BODY:
LEFT to their own devices, hockey players invariably skate without helmets. Yet when they vote in secret ballots, they almost always favor a rule requiring the gear. If this rule is such a good idea, why don't players just wear helmets on their own?
 Thomas C. Schelling posed this question in his book ''Micromotives and Macrobehavior,'' published in 1978. I had described Mr. Schelling, a professor emeritus at the University of Maryland, as the greatest living economist not to have received the Nobel Prize -- a description rendered obsolete when he won it this month, jointly with Robert J. Aumann of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. 
Although the Nobel committee cited Mr. Schelling's 1960 book, ''The Strategy of Conflict,'' history will judge ''Micromotives and Macrobehavior'' as the more important work. The earlier book was justly praised for framing the debate about nuclear deterrence in the cold war, while many questions in the later book seemed almost pedestrian. Yet Mr. Schelling's answers transformed the way many economists think about the relationship between competition and social welfare. 
 Adam Smith's celebrated theory of the invisible hand is the idea that individual pursuit of self-interest promotes the greatest good for all. When reward depends primarily on absolute performance -- the standard presumption in economics -- individual choice does indeed turn out to be remarkably efficient. But when reward depends primarily on relative performance, as in hockey, the invisible hand breaks down. In such situations, unrestricted choices by rational individuals often yield results that no one favors.
 To explain why, Mr. Schelling observed that by skating without a helmet, a player increases his team's odds of winning, perhaps because he can see and hear a little better, or more effectively intimidate opponents. The down side is that he also increases his odds of injury. If he values the higher odds of winning more than he values the extra safety, he will discard his helmet. Yet when others inevitably follow suit, the competitive balance is restored -- everyone faces more risk and no one benefits. Hence the attraction of helmet rules.
 As in hockey, many of the most important outcomes in life depend on relative position. Because a ''good'' school is an inescapably relative concept, each family's quest to provide a better education for its children has much in common with the athlete's quest for advantage. Families try to buy houses in the best school districts they can afford, yet when all families spend more, the result is merely to bid up the prices of those houses. Half of all children will still attend bottom-half schools. 
 Mr. Schelling's example thus suggests a radical new perspective on the various ways societies restrict individual choice. Consider the similarity between helmet rules and workplace safety regulations. Because riskier jobs pay higher wages, workers can gain advantage by accepting them. Just as unrestricted hockey players may feel compelled to discard their helmets, workers who are free to sell their safety may realize that unless they seize the higher wages, they will consign their children to inferior schools. In each case, limiting our options can prevent a mutually disadvantageous race to the bottom. 
 The logic of Mr. Schelling's example also challenges the cherished theory of revealed preference, which holds that we learn more about what people value by watching what they do than by listening to what they say. 
 If someone chooses a risky job paying $1,000 instead of a safer one paying $900, the theory concludes that he must value the extra safety at less than $100. Maybe, but only in the sense that a bareheaded hockey player reveals that he values winning above safety. In both cases, we may learn more about what people value by examining the rules they support than by studying their individual choices. 
 A similar interpretation applies to the Fair Labor Standards Act, which requires employers to pay overtime premiums for all hours worked in excess of 40. Free-market economists often denounce this, noting that many workers would voluntarily work the longer hours that employers would have offered in the absence of premiums. Yet here, too, the incentives confronting workers are much like those confronting hockey players. 
 Thus, as Mr. Schelling's fellow Nobel laureate, George A. Akerlof, has written, individuals can often increase the odds of promotion by working longer hours, but when others follow suit, everyone's promotion prospects remain roughly as before. The result is often a rat race in which all must work until 8 o'clock each evening merely to avoid falling behind.
 Mr. Schelling is no fan of heavy-handed bureaucratic interventions. Still, as his examples make clear, there can be no presumption that the self-serving choices of rational individuals produce the greatest good for all.
 The invisible hand assumes that reward depends only on absolute performance. The fact is that life is graded on the curve.

HEADLINE: Face Potions Break the Four-Figure Barrier

BYLINE: By NATASHA SINGER

 BODY:
AT the end of August five women in Calgary, Alberta, received via express mail engraved invitations to try the world's most expensive face lotion. Each of them met privately with a beauty adviser at the Holt Renfrew department store in Calgary, who presented the Essence from Creme de la Mer. Made mainly of fermented algae (billed as a ''miracle broth'' for the skin), it is kept in three magnetized tubes. The tubes are in turn contained in a plexiglass holder, which is housed in a jewelry-box-like case with foam-green lining.
 During the presentation the women were offered fresh berries and chilled Champagne. Four of them bought the lotion, a three-week supply for $2,100.
''It is very pricey,'' said Davie Myers, 50, a dental office consultant who was one of the buyers. A Creme de La Mer customer for more than five years, she had been waiting for the Essence to arrive in Canada since she heard about it last spring. ''You just felt chosen after that white-glove type of service. You had to try it at least once.'' 
 That an ounce and a half sells for roughly the equivalent of a top-of-the line laptop computer seems not to deter devoted La Mer customers. In London, Harrods has sold more than 100 boxes of the Essence in the three weeks it has been available (for about $2,650). In New York at Bergdorf Goodman there are 20 names on a waiting list, a sales clerk at the La Mer counter said. 
 The Essence is just one of the lotions and creams that have broken the four-figure price barrier at cosmetics counters in the last five months. As recently as last spring the most expensive skin care products -- like ReVive Intensite Volumizing Serum and N.V. Perricone M.D. Neuropeptide Facial Conformer -- cost a mere $600. Now there are cosmetics that run to $1,000, $2,000 and more. 
 Over the summer Kanebo introduced its Sensai Premier three-step skin care system at $1,320, and within two weeks eight Saks Fifth Avenue stores sold out their inventories, said Mokoto Nakamura, the president of Kanebo Cosmetics USA. DDF RMX Maximum ($1,000), a 28-day skin care regimen, which comes in tiny frozen vials, made its debut at Sephora in September and has been selling briskly. The most expensive treatment at Harrods in London, introduced this year, is a 10-product variety pack from Creme de la Mer, which comes with its own sterling silver tray. The price is $6,200. Five have been sold so far.
 The sky-high price hikes come on the heels of a more gradual, though still striking, rise in the cost of luxury skin care. Between June 2002 and June 2005 top prices doubled to $600 from $300, according to NPD Beauty, a division of the NPD Group, the market research firm. Yet inflation does not seem to be driving customers away. Sales of cosmetics that cost more than $150 are expected to reach $40 million this year, NPD predicts, almost double the $23.2 million in sales in 2004.
 The new potions offer rarefied ingredients, velvety textures, elaborate rituals and vague promises to enhance the skin's appearance and camouflage the effects of aging. That they may be little more effective than their drugstore counterparts in the view of some dermatologists and cosmetic chemists seems almost beside the point. What customers are buying is the ultimate in luxury cosmetics, which some say makes them feel they are taking the best possible care of themselves. 
 ''My face, which is normally very dry, feels luxurious and looks luminous,'' said Denise Fadili, 55, a real estate manager from Wakefield, Mass., after trying Kanebo's Sensai Premier. ''It's very expensive, but it was worth it.'' 
 To some industry analysts these cosmetics do not seem worth the price. Many contain smoothing ingredients like silicone and olive oil, which transparently coat the skin, creating a silky surface. Some also have proteins that are absorbed by the top layer of the skin and attract water, causing the surface to look plumper, cosmetic chemists say. Other ingredients may disperse or refract light so that the skin's surface appears more uniform.
 ''These are steep prices to pay for a temporary enhancement that might alter the appearance of the skin,'' said Lawrence H. Block, a professor of pharmaceutics at the Mylan School of Pharmacy at Duquesne University. Dr. Block has been researching cosmetic delivery systems and consulting with beauty companies on product formulations for 40 years. ''The ingredients do not penetrate the skin or change anything fundamental in the underlying structure. As soon as you cease using the products, any effect you are seeing will dissipate rapidly.''
 But short-term improvements are good enough for some consumers, whose jobs or lifestyles require them to keep up appearances. Carol Cohen Freiselder, a television advertising sales representative in New York, who gave her age as over 55, views taking care of her skin as a professional investment, she said. She has been using $200 to $300 DDF products for 10 years, and last month she bought the brand's new $1,000 product.
 ''My skin felt plumper and firmer and got an overall glow that even my husband noticed,'' Ms. Freiselder said. ''When the product is finished, I may not run out immediately and spend another $1,000. But I might do it again in three months.''
 Cosmetics companies say the high prices reflect the research to create the new luxury products, as well as the ingredients and manufacturing processes that go into them. The main ingredient in DDF RMX, for example, is a milk protein from organically raised cows, which is expensive to extract and purify, said Karen Anne Kosta-Strachan, the company's director of quality and regulatory compliance. The Essence from Creme de la Mer's main ingredient -- algae from the ocean off San Diego -- is fermented for four months and then hand-mixed into small batches of cosmetics, said Loretta Miraglia, the company's senior vice president for creative product development.
 Dermatologists are stumped when women pay more for cosmetics than they would spend on medical treatments meant to improve appearance. The money it takes to buy one package of the Essence, for example, would pay for Botox injections (to smooth wrinkles), Restylane injections (to plump lips) and a laser procedure (to even out skin tone) at the offices of Dr. David Colbert, a dermatologist in Manhattan.
 ''For the same price you would get a marked dramatic change that might last up to six months,'' Dr. Colbert said. ''I'm all for patients using moisturizers. But even the cheaper ones like Vaseline or Nivea are going to give you a smoother skin surface that will reflect the light better and give you a more uniform texture.''
 Not all women believe the medical treatments are necessarily better. ''I've spent more money on laser photofacials, microdermabrasions and peels at a doctor's office than I did on the Essence, and my skin never looked a quarter as good as it does now,'' Ms. Myers in Calgary said. 
 But others who have sprung for the new treatments are more skeptical. Rebecca Rutledge, 55, a real estate agent in Palm Desert, Calif., has tried the most expensive items from La Prairie and Sisley but said the results were not noticeable enough to justify buying them again.
 ''When I get collagen, Restylane and Botox injections, I am spending thousands of dollars for a micrometer of change, but you can see the difference, and it's backed by science,'' said Ms. Rutledge, who regularly uses Renova, a prescription cream that reduces sun damage. ''I'm looking for results from skin care too. Renova costs $175, and it lasts for months.
 ''But I see fabulous results when I use Olay Regenerist eye serum too. That costs $19, and you don't need a prescription.''

HEADLINE: Treasury Note Price Slides; Yield Is Highest Since March 

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News

 BODY:
United States Treasuries fell yesterday, pushing the 10-year note's yield to the highest it has been since March, on speculation that the Federal Reserve will continue raising interest rates into next year.
 Stocks had their first back-to-back losses in two weeks after revenue forecasts from Amazon.com and Boeing proved disappointing.
 The shortfalls left the market unable to capitalize on a morning rally, set off by better-than-expected earnings from Chubb and ConocoPhillips. Even the biggest drop in oil prices in a month failed to help. 
 Treasuries extended a sell-off that began when Ben S. Bernanke was named to succeed Alan Greenspan as Fed chairman three days ago.
 ''It's the biggest breakdown we've seen in the market in a long time, and it's caught people flat-footed,'' said Gregg Cohen, a proprietary trader at Cantor Fitzgerald. ''It started with Bernanke.''
 The benchmark 10-year Treasury note's yield rose to 4.58 percent, from 4.53 percent. The price fell 13/32, to 97 12/32. The note's yield moves inversely to price.
 Interest rate futures show traders are increasingly convinced that the Fed, which has raised its target for the overnight lending rate between banks 11 times since June 2004, will raise it at each of the three remaining meetings of Mr. Greenspan's tenure.
 The rise in yields also reflects the risk that the Fed may not control inflation as effectively after Mr. Greenspan's term as chairman ends Jan. 31, interest rate strategists at Barclays Capital in New York wrote in a research report. Mr. Bernanke, a former Fed governor, will succeed Mr. Greenspan pending confirmation by the Senate. 
 The speculation about interest rates also weighed on stocks. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 5.16, or 0.4 percent, to 1,191.38. The Dow Jones industrial average was down 32.89, or 0.3 percent, at 10,344.98. The Nasdaq composite index dropped 9.40, or 0.5 percent, to 2,100.05.
 Boeing, the world's biggest aircraft maker, lost $1.87, or 2.8 percent, to $65.10 a share. The company reduced its 2005 sales forecast to $55.5 billion to reflect the delays from a machinists' strike and slower growth at its military business. It also cut its forecast for the delivery of aircraft to 290 planes this year.
 Amazon.com, the largest online retailer, plunged $6.42, to $39.75 a share. For the year, Amazon forecast sales of $8.37 billion to $8.67 billion, and the midpoint of that missed estimates, said Timothy M. Ghriskey, who helps oversee $800 million at Solaris Asset Management.
 Chubb, an insurer of commercial property and upscale houses, rallied $5.59, to $91.62 a share. The company said on Tuesday that third-quarter profit before investment gains was 89 cents a share, more than four times the 20 cents estimated by Michael Dion, an analyst at Sandler O'Neill & Partners in New York, as claims from Hurricane Katrina were lower than expected.
 ConocoPhillips, the No.3 United States oil company, added 36 cents, to reach $62.80 a share. The company said third-quarter net income was $2.68 a share on supply disruptions and rising demand. On average, analysts expected $2.57, according to a survey by Thomson Financial.
 Flextronics International, the largest maker of electronics for other companies, slumped $2.90, or 24 percent, to $9.20 a share. The company forecast third-quarter earnings that trailed analysts' estimates as demand slipped for almost all its products.
 Crude oil futures slid 1.8 percent, to $60.66 a barrel, in New York after an Energy Department report showed that United States inventories had increased.
 Following are the results of yesterday's auction of two-year Treasury notes.

HEADLINE: Patching the Presidency

BYLINE: By DAVID BROOKS

 BODY:
On Dec. 31, 1986, Robert Novak and Rowland Evans wrote a column with the headline ''The Reagan Presidency Is Dead.'' Halfway into its second term, the Reagan administration was beset by the Iran-contra scandal. Its legislative agenda was in tatters. Morale was low, and the decision-making process was in chaos.
 Ronald Reagan had to decide whether to hunker down in the storm or break out of it. Pat Buchanan, who was the communications director, recommended that the president bring a special counselor into the White House to handle Iran-contra and bring an objective perspective to the administration's troubles. 
 Reagan agreed. David Abshire, then the ambassador to NATO, was hired and given complete autonomy.
 Abshire describes his job in his new book, ''Saving the Reagan Presidency.'' He had four tasks. First, puncture the bubble of intellectual conformity that marks every administration by breaking the spell of groupthink and self-serving spin. Abshire had direct access to the president, and in his 12 one-on-one meetings with Reagan, he was able to say things he could never have said in larger meetings. Even so, Reagan found it very hard to admit that what happened in Iran-Contra actually happened. 
 Second, iron out the feuds and tensions (between, say, Defense and State). Third, repair relations with Capitol Hill. Congress dominates all second terms, and any president who doesn't adapt will fail. 
 Finally, Abshire helped kick-start a new policy agenda. The old chief of staff, Don Regan, was fired, and Howard Baker was brought in. Reagan gave a contrite speech taking responsibility for Iran-contra, and his approval rating jumped nine points.
 New initiatives to end the cold war were launched, including the speech calling on Gorbachev to tear down the Berlin Wall. Domestic ideas, built around an economic bill of rights, were floated. The administration never fully recovered, but the last two years of Reagan's term were productive, and, in the way Reagan dealt with Gorbachev, historic.
 The Bush administration is not in quite the same bind the Reagan administration was in. There is no one big scandal (sorry, Plamegate is not it). But at key moments -- Social Security, Katrina, Harriet Miers -- the president has been uncharacteristically out of step with the American people. Second-term-itis is setting in.
 Remember, every president since Grant has had a miserable second term. Eisenhower called his sixth year in office the ''worst of his life.''
 There are many causes: one's own party gets fractious; management failures that have festered over the years blossom into scandal; people who have failed inside the administration snipe from the outside. But the primary cause is psychological.
 ''The political mind,'' Calvin Coolidge wrote after his presidency, ''is the product of men in public life who have been twice spoiled. They have been spoiled with praise and they have been spoiled with abuse. With them, nothing is natural, everything is artificial.'' 
 It is thrilling to work in a White House, but it is also psychologically corrosive. In a disciplined White House, one cannot really talk with people outside. There is a tendency to curl inward under the barrage of criticism, much of it ill informed. The sheer busyness of life becomes enveloping and isolating, and slowly an unearned disdain builds for those who are not in the bubble. 
 The question now is whether this president will hunker down (and so reinforce his isolation) or break out.
 Breaking out doesn't mean bringing in James Baker. It means bringing in like-minded but objective people who haven't been molded by five years in power, like, say, Vin Weber. It means restoring cabinet government so the president will be surrounded with people more akin to peers. (The White House staff is too emotionally dependent on the president to be brutally honest with him.) 
 It means humbly acknowledging, as Peggy Noonan wrote, that change has to start with oneself. As Lincoln showed, humility is the only antidote to the corruptions of the insane lifestyle of the presidency.
 In policy terms it means getting back to the key challenges that face the country: keeping up with China, rebalancing the fiscal situation, rebuilding confidence in the war on terror. 
 Reagan broke out of the bubble and second-term-itis. It's still possible that Bush, learning from Reagan, can, too.

HEADLINE: Cow Politics

 BODY:
The Australian trade minister, Mark Vaile, pointed out the other day that a typical cow in the European Union receives a government subsidy of $2.20 a day -- more than what 1.2 billion of the world's poorest people live on every day. Some experts say the developed world could lift 140 million people out of that mire of poverty if it really reformed the way it managed agricultural trade.
 So why is the current round of trade negotiations coming down to the wire, as usual? Will Europe, Japan and America actually keep the promise they made four years ago in Doha, Qatar, to slash their subsidies to farmers? Such a move would finally begin the long-delayed dismantling of a distorted program that has helped rich farmers in the developed world at the expense of poor farmers in the developing world. 
But in these last few weeks before the big World Trade Organization meeting in Hong Kong, where negotiators are supposed to reach a deal, attacks and counterattacks are flying. The big industrialized nations are leaving no stone unturned in their quest to keep protecting their farmers. The United States trade representative, Robert Portman, took a big step toward doing the right thing earlier this month when he proposed that the United States would slash allowable farm subsidies by 60 percent if Europe and Japan would cut their subsidies by 83 percent. (The percentage is higher because European countries and Japan have higher subsidies.)
 Given all the noise the British prime minister, Tony Blair, and his European colleagues have made about the need to ''make poverty history,'' you would think that the Europeans would jump at the American proposal. Think again. In Europe, farmers are apparently terrified of having to compete without the government around to hold their hands.
 So the European Union has not only not made a meaningful counteroffer, but France -- the worst of a bad lot -- is also doing everything it can to get in the way of even the anemic talk of compromise from the European Union's trade chief, Peter Mandelson. ''If you don't believe in trade, then why are you a member of the W.T.O.?'' a frustrated Mr. Portman asked rhetorically. Funny, we were just wondering that ourselves.
 The developed world funnels nearly $1 billion a day in subsidies to its farmers, encouraging overproduction. That drives down prices and leaves farmers in poor nations unable to compete with subsidized products, even within their own countries. In recent years, American farmers have dumped cotton and other products on world markets at prices that do not begin to cover their cost of production. Europe's system is even worse; the United States' farm subsidies are only a third of Europe's.
 It is past time for European leaders to match their actions to their lip service about free and fair trade. A cow in France shouldn't make more than a farmer in Burkina Faso. That is just shameful.
 But let's not let the United States government entirely off the hook. The lawmakers in Congress who coddle rich American corporate farmers -- often to the detriment of small family farmers -- are not helping things. The Senate Agriculture Committee just voted to extend the subsidies paid to growers of cotton, rice and other commodities until 2011, subsidies that were supposed to expire in the 2007 farm bill. This political move is made worse by sneaking the subsidies into a budget bill rather than properly debating them as part of the farm bill. 
 The Bush administration has done a good job so far in opposing these myriad forms of agribusiness welfare. The United States trade negotiators say the Senate Agriculture Committee's move will make their job at the trade organization talks more difficult. It's hard to preach the free trade gospel abroad when lawmakers at home are busily taking care of their own special interests.

HEADLINE: Questions To Stir Up A Quiet Race

BYLINE: By JOYCE PURNICK

 BODY:
THE most open secret in town right now is the nature of the mayoral campaign between the incumbent, Michael R. Bloomberg, and his Democratic challenger, Fernando Ferrer. 
 It is the campaign that isn't.
It is difficult to see how it could be otherwise, given the billionaire mayor's personal resources, the advantages of incumbency and Mr. Ferrer's inability to overcome his financial disadvantage enough to engage the public's imagination. 
 This late, the campaign is not about to turn routine, but with the first televised debate between Mr. Ferrer and Mr. Bloomberg coming up this Sunday morning on WABC, maybe the public will get a taste of how it could have been. Here are just a few suggested questions the two could explore. 
 For Mr. Bloomberg:
 The financial imbalance between you and Mr. Ferrer is so great that the fabled Douglas Muzzio, a political science professor at Baruch College, refers to a ''vertical playing field.'' If the roles were reversed, how would you combat an opponent's unlimited resources? How can we, in the long run, have fairer elections when one candidate is unusually wealthy -- not just nonpartisan elections but non-lopsided elections?
 Echoing a Ferrer proposal, you said this week that you want to enroll more city children in government health programs, including the state's Child Health Plus plan. That program was created in 1991 and expanded in 1997. What took so long?
 A similar question could be asked about your recent remarks favoring more housing and less commercial space at ground zero.
 This has been a central issue since Sept. 11, but you have been largely absent from the debate, even failing to fill four of your eight appointments to the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation. Do you now think that your inaction and deference to Gov. George E. Pataki were mistakes?
 We know you stand by your ill-fated initiatives to bring the Olympics to New York and to build a stadium on the Far West Side of Manhattan. How do you respond to criticism that you were so taken with those proposals that you gave short shrift to other ambitious development plans, including those for ground zero?
 Mr. Ferrer says that too many high school students fail to graduate on time. The statistics have in fact gotten better since you've been mayor, but only slightly. You have made improving education the centerpiece of your mayoralty. Why such minimal progress in the high schools?
 For Mr. Ferrer: 
 Mr. Bloomberg's first challenge as mayor was to restore fiscal stability after Sept. 11. His approach was to cut spending, raise property taxes and increase borrowing. You have criticized the mayor for raising taxes after promising not to, but what would you have done differently to close a budget deficit of nearly $5 billion? 
 You were long against the death penalty, then dropped your opposition, then said you supported capital punishment for some crimes -- but also a moratorium on its imposition. At a debate last month, you said it was justified in some instances, but still favored a moratorium. Please clarify.
 Last spring, your proposal for reinstating the stock transfer tax to benefit education was harshly criticized. Please describe your current thinking about the stock transfer tax, directly addressing concerns that it could hurt Wall Street, and therefore the city economy.
 After the mayor said he favored more housing at ground zero, you criticized him for not speaking out sooner, noting, ''The mayor owns this problem.'' What do you want built there?
 You have taken the mayor to task for his Republican bona fides, especially for donating to Republican candidates, and for his muted criticism of the president. If you were mayor, with the White House and Congress under Republican control, wouldn't you consider it your obligation to maintain good relations with Washington?
 And, for both candidates:
 Mr. Ferrer often cites the ''two New Yorks'' of rich and poor, with one in five New Yorkers living below the poverty line, according to the census, even as the super-rich spend enough on one handbag to feed a family of four for a month or two.
 Would you support a new war on poverty? If so, describe how it would differ from approaches tried before. 
 And in closing, if warranted: Thank you and good morning, gentlemen. New York appreciates this rare example of bipartisan chattiness.

HEADLINE: Mayor Runs on Schools, but Verdict Is Still Out

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN

 BODY:
In his inauguration speech, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg pledged to win control of the sprawling, chaotic and troubled New York City public school system. ''Together,'' he declared, ''we will create a school system that works for all our children.'' 
 He won control within six months. And all through his term, he has told voters that public education was his top priority -- so much so that as he runs for re-election Mr. Bloomberg has made it all but impossible for his opponent to lay claim to the issue.
Mr. Bloomberg, who never promised a quick fix, is unwavering in his conviction that the schools are improving. ''For the first time in decades, by virtually every number, this school system is getting better,'' he said on the first day of school last month.
 So glowing an assessment is hardly universal. The corporate-philanthropic world is thrilled. Parents are guardedly optimistic. Elected officials are skeptical. Much of the teaching force is deeply demoralized. Principals are torn. Policy experts are fascinated but undecided. 
 The data, too, is far from conclusive: Scores from the last school year were mostly stellar, but the four-year graduation rate has barely budged; school crime statistics are encouraging but incomplete; class sizes and the citywide attendance rate have remained relatively flat. 
 High-ranking education officials say that some of the most crucial changes during the mayor's tenure are mostly invisible to the public -- better teacher training, uniform expectations for all students, and an unwavering focus on instruction. 
 ''When you were a principal, a new chancellor was announced, basically it was a blip on the radar screen,'' said Carmen Farina, the deputy chancellor for teaching and learning and a 40-year veteran of the system. ''Then we were able to hide for a good amount of time,'' she said. ''This is very, very different. This is an entire city working in unison to do what's better for kids.'' 
 She added that in a system long split between haves and have-nots, all schools in all neighborhoods are now getting equal attention and resources.
 As Election Day, Nov. 8, nears, a curious thing has happened: Some of the noisiest critics of Mr. Bloomberg's effort to redesign the school system have endorsed him or have remained neutral and refused to embrace his Democratic challenger, Fernando Ferrer. 
 Mr. Ferrer has pointed to the city's largely unchanged four-year graduation rate of just above 50 percent as proof that Mr. Bloomberg has failed on the only measure that matters: how many children leave prepared for college or a job. So far, Mr. Ferrer's charges have not dented the mayor's lead in the polls. 
 Mr. Bloomberg said he was not surprised that his opponent had been unable to gain ground on the schools issue. 
 ''Maybe I am too naive,'' the mayor said in an interview last week at City Hall. ''But the answer is that most people think the school system, while nowhere near where you want it to be, is going in the right direction.'' 
 The critics say that in backing Mr. Bloomberg, their larger purpose is to give the system a measure of stability. They add that they still would like to see substantial changes if the mayor wins a second term, particularly in addressing some of the system's most entrenched problems. 
 ''To not have stability in the system, to start all over would be terrible,'' said Eva S. Moskowitz, the chairwoman of the City Council Education Committee and a persistent critic of the mayor's policies who nonetheless endorsed him. 
 Even critics admit that Mr. Bloomberg has had an impact on the schools that his recent predecessors at City Hall could hardly have envisioned. He and his chancellor, Joel I. Klein, have left virtually no part of the system untouched.
 They dismantled the central bureaucracy and the 32 local school districts. They sold 110 Livingston Street and moved the headquarters to the Tweed Courthouse behind City Hall, allowing officials to trot back and forth. 
 They adopted uniform reading and math programs for most schools, imposed strict promotion rules tied to test scores in third, fifth and seventh grades, created an enhanced summer school and Saturday tutoring sessions for failing students. 
 They hired more than 1,000 parent coordinators and gave each one a cellphone. They opened more than 150 small high schools to replace the unruly behemoths that were failing at an alarming level with four-year graduation rates as low as 23 percent. 
 They assigned literacy and math coaches to train teachers in most schools. They welcomed charter-school operators, opening about two dozen of the privately operated, publicly financed schools. They created a principal-training academy financed by $75 million in private donations, and they began major projects for special-education students and non-English speakers. And, moving so rapidly, school officials admit, they made mistakes at every turn.
 The discipline process broke down, allowing violent students to return to class unpunished and prompting a remarkable mea culpa from the mayor. The new small schools worsened crowding in big schools and brought fights over space and resources. 
 The special-education system, long dysfunctional, became even more chaotic and confusing. At one point, dozens of sites used by dropouts to prepare for equivalency degrees were closed without notice, leaving students already at risk with nowhere to turn. 
 ''This,'' Ms. Moskowitz said, ''was the gang that couldn't shoot straight.'' 

Sole Propietorship
 By some accounts, in early 2002, the newly elected Mr. Bloomberg used negotiating skills honed on Wall Street and his reputation as an outsider to attain control of the schools. 
 By other analyses, Mr. Bloomberg got lucky. Anger over the system's failings finally boiled over; mayoral control was the obvious next step after a 1996 law stripping power from the city's local school boards failed to yield improvements. 
 Regardless, the pendulum had swung. Past mayors could kick at the school system -- one even said it should be ''blown up'' -- since they knew that they lacked the power to change anything and that voters would not hold them accountable. 
 ''I don't think it would be feasible for a mayor in the future to say that he or she doesn't have ownership,'' Chancellor Klein said in a recent interview. Parents can now call the 311 phone line with questions or e-mail the mayor or chancellor and expect a reply. 
 By July 2002, Mr. Bloomberg made it clear that the system had become a sole proprietorship. He bluntly warned his appointees to the Panel for Educational Policy, which replaced the Board of Education, that he never wanted to see them quoted by news organizations. 
 ''I would not tolerate it for 30 seconds,'' he said, adding: ''They don't have to speak, and they don't have to serve. That's what serving 'at the pleasure' means.'' 
 Mr. Bloomberg personally selected Mr. Klein, a former federal prosecutor best known for leading the antitrust action against Microsoft. The mayor insists that Mr. Klein, an outsider rather than a career educator, was ''100 percent the right choice,'' a man more intent on getting results than attention.
 To some, mayoral control has weakened the chancellorship, long a bully pulpit in American education. But Seymour Fliegel, a former deputy superintendent in East Harlem and now president of a nonprofit group that supports the city schools, said Mr. Klein's willingness to relinquish the spotlight was crucial. 
 ''One thing I like about Klein is that he understood he is a commissioner, not a chancellor,'' said Mr. Fliegel, who has mostly applauded the mayor's efforts.
 Mr. Klein's arrival began a restructuring of the school bureaucracy, including the dismissal or retirement of dozens of veteran administrators. In their place came young management consultants, lawyers, former investment bankers and executives.
 In some instances, the loss of institutional memory was crippling, leaving the new officials wondering, for example, how to close the system on a snow day. 
 The bulk of the mayor's changes took effect in September 2003, and by December the system was convulsed in chaos. Among other problems, the student suspension process fell apart, making it impossible to remove violent offenders. 
 After the problems became public, Mr. Bloomberg accepted responsibility. ''We screwed up,'' he said on his weekly radio program, adding: ''You can't blame anyone else. Blame me. I wanted control. I got control, and I am going to do something about it.'' 
 Within two weeks, he announced a plan to flood the city's most dangerous schools with additional safety agents and police officers. 
 Later, when it became clear that the Panel for Educational Policy would reject Mr. Bloomberg's new rules barring the promotion of failing third graders, the mayor dismissed two of his appointees and the Staten Island borough president dismissed a third -- a move viewed as gutsy by some and heavy-handed by others.
 ''Suffice it to say that I accepted their resignation,'' Mr. Bloomberg said in the interview. Looking genuinely perplexed, he added: ''I never understood why they refused to go along.'' 

Rising Test Scores, Mostly
 In the end, Mr. Bloomberg's promotion policy addressed the worries of the dismissed panel members, who had cited research showing that students left back without extra help were far more likely to drop out of school. 
 Ms. Farina and Michele Cahill, the senior counselor for education policy, created an appeals process, provided after-school tutoring and Saturday classes and designed a new summer school program. They also published detailed promotion criteria so that all children would be held to the same expectations. 
 As a result, Mr. Bloomberg got his tougher standards and the children got added instruction. Scores rose, more third graders were promoted after summer school, and fewer were held back than the year before. 
 But critics say the mayor's policy has turned the schools into test prep mills that neglect social studies, science, art, music, foreign languages and physical education. 
 ''If they are not learning social studies but their reading scores are going up, they are not getting an education,'' said Diane Ravitch, the education historian and a critic of the mayor's educational program.
 In his blitz of campaign television ads, Mr. Bloomberg's most frequent and succinct boast about the schools is that scores are up. ''Highest ever,'' a narrator declares in one ad. 
 For the most part, scores released this year made an impressive jump, with the notable exception of eighth grade, in which both reading and math scores declined. The significance of the gains is difficult to discern, though. 
 Citywide last school year, the number of fourth graders meeting standards on the state literacy test rose by 9.9 points, to 59.5 percent. But Yonkers, Rochester and Syracuse had bigger gains, suggesting that whatever New York City did, those cities somehow did it better. 
 The most striking results came in the fifth grade, where students faced the mayor's new promotion rules for the first time. The number of fifth graders meeting standards rose 19.5 points in reading, to 68.5 percent, and 15.2 points in math, to 53.7 percent -- gains that Mr. Bloomberg credited to his policy. 
 Since 1999, the biggest gains in reading scores were among fourth graders, most likely because of the emphasis placed on fourth grade by the annual state exams. 
 Mr. Bloomberg, it seems, can take credit for putting the same emphasis on other grades, which saw big gains for 2004-5. He can also take credit for continuing, even accelerating, long-term gains in math scores. 
 Eighth grade remains problematic, suggesting that many students still enter high school unprepared for higher-level work. The bottom line is that little more than half of city students in grades 3 to 8 are proficient in literacy and math. 
 ''If the ultimate barometer of whether the education system is doing better is standardized test scores, I think the conclusion one would make is that our public school system is doing maybe a little better,'' said Assemblyman Steven Sanders, a Manhattan Democrat and chairman of the Assembly Education Committee. 
 Mr. Ferrer has accused Mr. Bloomberg of focusing on short-term test results and ignoring the city's woeful graduation rate. 
 There are wide disagreements over how to calculate graduation rates, but according to the city's official numbers the four-year rate stands at a record for the last two decades: 54.3 percent of the class of 2004 graduated on time; up from 51 percent for the class of 2001, and the highest rate since 1986. 
 Mr. Bloomberg has answered Mr. Ferrer's criticism by noting that the graduation rate is rising. But officials are generally at a loss to explain the increase. Also, the number of students receiving a Regents diploma, meaning they met basic state criteria, declined slightly to 33.2 percent for the class of 2004, from 35.4 percent for the class of 2002. 
 In hopes of lifting the graduation rate, the administration has undertaken an intense effort to create ''multiple pathways'' to graduation, including special schools for older students at risk of dropping out, evening schools and a new job-counseling program. As with other efforts to address entrenched ills, it is too soon to see results. 

Community Relations
 A new issue born of mayoral control has been the administration's relationship with parents, community groups, educators and their unions. 
 The 32 community school boards were replaced by parent councils that are largely powerless. Many of the members say they feel marginalized. 
 Relations with the teachers' union, the United Federation of Teachers, have been bitter, with teachers saying they were never made true partners in the mayor's efforts. Even a recent contract deal that persuaded union leaders to remain neutral in the mayor's race has not tamped down teachers' anger.
 ''People are really unhappy over the way they have been treated over the last three years,'' Randi Weingarten, the union president, said. ''The esprit de corps that used to go on between principals, parents and teachers is gone. That makes the schools a lot worse.'' 
 Mr. Bloomberg said that his administration, over two contract deals, had given teachers better than a 33 percent raise. ''I think most teachers are pretty happy,'' he said. 
 Jill S. Levy, president of the principals' union, said the administration repeatedly showed disrespect for principals by not giving them real authority. Her union has endorsed Mr. Ferrer. ''There's no neutrality here,'' Ms. Levy said, adding of the mayor, ''He can't buy us.''
 Mr. Bloomberg insists that the role of principals is crucial. 
 ''In any organization,'' Mr. Bloomberg said, ''the line managers are the ones that really make things work.'' 
 ''In schools,'' he added, ''we call a line manager a principal.'' 
 But if Mr. Bloomberg can be overly corporate in his relations with educators, his tone is idealistic, even dreamy, when he reflects on his effort to fix the schools. ''It's a chance to change the world,'' he said.

HEADLINE: PORT AUTHORITY FOUND NEGLIGENT IN 1993 BOMBING

BYLINE: By ANEMONA HARTOCOLLIS; Colin Moynihan contributed reporting for this article.

 BODY:
A Manhattan jury said yesterday that the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey was negligent in safeguarding the World Trade Center before the first terror attack on the twin towers, the 1993 bombing that killed six people and injured 1,000.
 In a verdict that could prove costly for the Port Authority, the six-member jury in State Supreme Court unanimously found that the agency did not heed warnings that the underground garage was vulnerable to terrorist attack and should be closed to public parking. This failure, the jury said, was ''a substantial factor'' in allowing the bombing to occur.
It was in the basement garage below the trade center that Islamic terrorists detonated a van packed with explosives on Feb. 26, 1993, foreshadowing the attack that brought down the towers and killed nearly 3,000 people on Sept. 11, 2001.
 The verdict came after four weeks of testimony from security experts and three former directors of the Port Authority. The jury took just over a day to reach its decision. 
 Although Port Authority lawyers said they would appeal, it was the most significant moment yet in a 12-year battle to hold the agency accountable for the events of that February day, which ushered in a new era of security consciousness in New York City and across the country.
 The victims of the 1993 bombings never received the outpouring of public support or government compensation that went to those of the much more devastating 9/11 attacks. 
 More than 400 plaintiffs, including people hurt in the attack, families of the dead and businesses, have lawsuits pending against the Port Authority, lawyers said yesterday. The negligence verdict clears the way for them to press forward with claims for lost wages, damage to businesses, and pain and suffering. 
 Lawyers for the plaintiffs said they were seeking a total of as much as $1.8 billion. Those cases will be decided through separate legal proceedings, which could end in trials or settlements. The authority also faces lawsuits relating to the 9/11 attacks.
 David J. Dean, the lead lawyer for the plaintiffs, called the verdict ''an extraordinary victory.'' The jury, he said, clearly accepted the plaintiffs' argument that the Port Authority should have foreseen the terrorist attack, based on warnings from its own experts as early as 1985, and shut down the public parking garage.
 ''The case was never about blaming the terrorists,'' Mr. Dean said yesterday. ''It was about what the Port Authority should have done. They disregarded the advice of their own experts and other experts. They were motivated by money. They should have thought about the ultimate sacrifice of human lives.''
 Marc Kasowitz, the lead lawyer for the Port Authority, said the jury was wrong in blaming the authority. ''The Feb. 26, 1993, attack on the World Trade Center was the act of terrorists for which terrorists alone are responsible,'' he said. ''The Port Authority believes in our American jury system. It strongly believes that the decision in this case was egregiously incorrect.''
 He said there were strong grounds for appeal of the verdict, ''based on errors made by the court during this trial.'' 
 The burden on the plaintiffs was to show that the Port Authority should have foreseen the likelihood of a terrorist attack and taken steps to prevent it.
 In order to reach a verdict, at least five of the six jurors had to agree. The jury voted unanimously that the Port Authority was negligent. It found the authority 68 percent at fault for the bombing, while the terrorists who carried it out were 32 percent at fault. 
 Mr. Dean, the plaintiffs' lawyer, said that because the jury apportioned more than half the blame to the Port Authority, the agency will have to pay 100 percent of any damages for pain and suffering, the so-called non-economic damages, that might be awarded. 
 Regardless of how the blame was shared, the Port Authority would have to pay 100 percent of any economic damages, like lost business, he said.
 The jury deadlocked, 4 to 2 in favor of the Port Authority, on whether that negligence rose to the level of recklessness. 
 The plaintiffs, however, indicated that they considered the 4-to-2 vote a hung jury, leaving open the possibility of a retrial on that question. Mr. Kasowitz, the Port Authority lawyer, said he considered the verdict on recklessness a no vote. Justice Nicholas Figueroa said that the lawyers would return to court to discuss that portion of the verdict.
 During the four weeks of testimony, the trial focused on a 1985 report by the Office of Special Planning, an antiterrorist task force convened by Peter Goldmark, who was the executive director of the Port Authority from 1977 to 1985.
 Mr. Goldmark created the office in 1984, after becoming concerned that, given terrorist activities in other parts of the world, the trade center, as a symbol of American capitalism and strength, could be a target. After a visit to Scotland Yard in London that year, he wrote a memo saying that Scotland Yard was ''appalled'' that there would be public transient parking beneath a facility like the World Trade Center. 
 The report concluded: ''A time-bomb-laden vehicle could be driven into the W.T.C. and parked in the public parking area. The driver would then exit via elevator into the W.T.C. and proceed with his business unnoticed. At a predetermined time, the bomb could be exploded in the basement. The amount of explosives used will determine the severity of damage to that area.''
 Among the report's recommendations was: ''Eliminate all public parking in the World Trade Center.'' It also recommended a series of compromise steps, including guarded entrances to the parking lots, random searches of vehicles and restrictions on pedestrian access.
 The report came out about four months after Mr. Goldmark left the Port Authority, and his successors decided not to close the public lot, citing the potential loss of revenue and inconvenience to tenants, according to evidence at the trial. They also decided against most of the compromise measures.
 In 1991, according to the testimony, the Port Authority commissioned a second report, from Burns and Roe Securacom, a private security company. That report found that the major risk to the trade center was from a package or hand-held bomb, and that the shopping and pedestrian areas, not the parking garage, would be the most likely targets.
 Several jurors interviewed after the verdict yesterday said the mere fact that the 1985 predictions came true had weighed heavily in the verdict.
 One of the jurors, Rafael Garcia, a development executive at Nickelodeon, who lives in Chelsea, called the report ''irrefutable evidence'' that was ''eerily prescient as far as what could happen.''
 ''The O.S.P. report was paramount,'' said Ray Gonzalez, another juror, who lives in Murray Hill and is the director of housekeeping for a nursing home. ''Unfortunately, from there, everybody seemed to drop the ball.'' 
 Jurors said that they were impressed by Mr. Goldmark, who testified for the plaintiffs and wept on the stand, and that they found the witnesses for the defense less credible. ''Goldmark was the only one who didn't seem to be a Port Authority company man,'' said the jury foreman, Alan Nelson, 54, of Washington Heights, who works in the services department of a law firm.
 In contrast, he said, the witnesses for the Port Authority, ''seemed highly programmed in their answers,'' and seemed to be speaking, ''from a bureaucratic, organization-man point of view.'' 
 The jurors said they had been offended, as the plaintiffs had hoped, by the Port Authority's focus on the potential for economic losses of a terrorist attack.
 One defense witness, a security consultant, Robert Ducibella, referred to the loss of human life as ''collateral damage.'' In one of the reports highlighted by the plaintiffs, the Port Authority rated the window-washing machine as a potentially important loss. From the beginning, the Sept. 11 attack hung over the trial like a ghost. The judge forbade both sides from mentioning it, saying that what happened after 1993 was not relevant.
 But both sides knew 9/11 would be in the minds of the jury, and the Port Authority repeatedly tried to capitalize on that by suggesting that nothing was going to stop terrorists from one day trying to take down the towers.
 Mr. Nelson, the jury foreman, said that while he was satisfied with the verdict, ''it's kind of an empty feeling in a way.''
 ''We're talking about a building that is no longer there,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Devastating Exodus of Doctors From Africa and Caribbean Is Found 

BYLINE: By CELIA W. DUGGER

 BODY:
A new study documents for the first time the devastating exodus of doctors from Africa and the Caribbean to four wealthy English-speaking nations, the United States, Britain, Canada and Australia, which now depend on international medical graduates for a quarter of their physicians.
 The findings are being published today in The New England Journal of Medicine. The study is likely to fuel an already furious debate about the role the developed world is playing in weakening African public health systems that have already been hit with pandemics that have shortened life expectancies in some countries. 
Dr. Agyeman Akosa, the director general of Ghana's health service, said in a phone interview from Geneva, where he is attending a World Health Organization forum on the global medical staffing crisis, that his country's public health system was virtually collapsing because it was losing not just many of its doctors, but its best ones.
 ''I have at least nine hospitals that have no doctor at all, and 20 hospitals with only one doctor looking after a whole district of 80,000 to 120,000 people,'' Dr. Akosa said. Women in obstructed labor all too often suffer terrible complications or death for lack of an obstetrician, he said.
 The study found that Ghana, with only 6 doctors for each 100,000 people, has lost 3 of every 10 doctors it has educated to the United States, Britain, Canada and Australia, each of which has more than 220 doctors per 100,000 people.
 Dr. Fitzhugh Mullan, a professor of medicine and public health at George Washington University, who carried out the study, tapped into databases in the four rich countries to learn where their international medical graduates had come from. 
 He said the flight of doctors was less the result of deliberate policies in the wealthy countries than of their failure to train enough doctors to fill their own needs. For example, the United States has about 17,000 medical school graduates each year for 22,000 first-year residency slots. 
 ''One of the most important things the United States can do for global health, frankly, is to educate more physicians in the United States to work in the United States,'' he said.
 The biggest losers are the small to medium-size countries of Africa and the Caribbean. Dr. Mullan's research found that Jamaica, for example, has lost 41 percent of its doctors and Haiti 35 percent, while Ghana has lost 30 percent and South Africa, Ethiopia and Uganda 14 to 19 percent. 
 In an editorial that accompanies Dr. Mullan's article, Dr. Lincoln C. Chen, director of the Global Equity Center at Harvard, and Dr. Jo Ivey Boufford, a professor of health policy at New York University, call the exodus of publicly trained doctors ''a silent theft'' by the richest countries from the poorest.
 Crumbling public health systems in poor countries, they wrote, also threaten the health of Americans in the face of potential outbreaks of avian flu and SARS. ''Protecting Americans requires viral detection and interdiction at points of origin,'' they wrote.
 Public health leaders in Africa say they will have to reform their own ailing systems. Dr. Francis Omaswa, who was director general of Uganda's health service until July, said that half of its doctor positions were vacant -- and that the exodus was not the only cause. For example, he said, some unemployed doctors cannot find jobs because they are not adequately advertised.
 Dr. Omaswa, now a special adviser to the World Health Organization on human resources for health, is helping to devise a set of proposals for what African and developed countries can do to ease the staffing crisis. ''Africa cannot solve it alone,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Bush Says 'Push the Envelope' on Cutbacks

BYLINE: By CARL HULSE

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 26 

 BODY:
President Bush urged Congress on Wednesday to ''push the envelope'' on spending cuts to help pay for hurricane relief while the administration backtracked on a ruling covering storm reconstruction that had come under steady attack from unions, Democrats and some Republicans.
 Labor Secretary Elaine L. Chao said the administration would reinstate the Davis-Bacon Act on Nov. 8 in the areas devastated by the Gulf Coast storms. That law requires paying wages at locally prevailing levels at construction projects financed by federal money. 
The White House suspended the law after Hurricane Katrina, saying the change could speed repairs and stretch federal aid. Critics said the administration, backed by conservative Congressional Republicans, was taking advantage of the disaster to lift a law important to unions. 
 The critics gained important support from a coalition of Northeastern and Midwestern Republicans who represent districts with significant union membership. They urged the White House chief of staff, Andrew H. Card Jr., to reverse the policy in meetings last week in the Capitol and again at the White House on Wednesday.
 ''With all the political problems the administration has, why pick this fight?'' asked Representative Peter T. King, Republican of New York. 
 Mr. King said suspending the rule would not produce significant savings because the labor demand in the affected areas would drive up wages on its own. 
 ''Politically, it seemed a gratuitous shot at unions who in many cases have supported the administration,'' he said.
 Democrats and labor leaders hailed the reinstatement but said they believed that they would have eventually been able to lift the suspension legislatively had the White House not acted. 
 ''Let me be clear,'' said Representative George Miller, the California Democrat who was pushing a legislative challenge. ''The president is backing down today only because he had no other choice.''
 John J. Sweeney, president of the A.F.L.-C.I.O., said in a statement that it was ''fundamentally wrong for the Bush administration to hit workers when they were down by slashing wages, exacerbating the very poverty that the hurricanes exposed.''
 Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts, said, ''Good jobs with good wages that provide a promising future for residents are a critical first step on the road to recovery.''
 Some Congressional Republicans were critical of the reversal, saying it will mean that federal relief dollars will ultimately buy less. 
 ''By reinstating Davis-Bacon, recovery projects will be delayed, and costs will be inflated,'' said Representative Jeff Flake, Republican of Arizona. 
 Mr. Flake and other House conservatives intensified their push for cuts in federal spending after the storm, contributing to the current drive in the House and Senate for at least $35billion in reductions the next five years. 
 In a speech to the Economic Club of Washington on Wednesday, Mr. Bush encouraged lawmakers to impose across-the-board spending cuts. He said the House and Senate were ''making progress toward cuts that will show the American people we're capable of being wise about the money and, at the same time, meet our priorities.''
 Setting up a politically charged floor fight next week, the Senate Budget Committee on Wednesday approved by a party-line vote a package with $39billion in spending reductions and revenue increases. The package includes a plan to open the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil exploration and a $10billion cut for Medicare and Medicaid. Republicans say the changes are needed to help pay for disaster aid and slow the growth of government. Democrats are uniformly opposed, saying that the cuts are harsh and that they will in some cases fall hardest on those displaced by the storms.
 ''I have never felt that a budget going through the Congress of the United States is more disconnected from reality than this budget,'' said Senator Kent Conrad of North Dakota, the senior Democrat on the Budget Committee.
 House committees advanced their own plans intended to identify $50billion in savings, with panels approving proposals to cut money to enforce child support, to tighten eligibility for foster care aid and to raise premiums for employers who contribute to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation. 
 On Thursday, the House Agriculture Committee is to consider reducing spending on food stamps by more than $1billion. House members are also pushing their own Arctic drilling plan and a proposal to increase offshore drilling.
 The delicacy of some of those issues makes it difficult for House Republicans to round up the votes to pass their proposal next month, and the leadership is trying to secure support from balking moderates.
 Mr. King said he did not view the administration switch on the wage law as part of any effort to win votes for the spending cuts. 
 ''There wasn't any trade-off,'' said Mr. King, who said he was undecided on the spending package. ''I am going to wait and see.''

HEADLINE: Grand Jury Hears Counsel in C.I.A. Leak Case as White House Waits

BYLINE: By DAVID JOHNSTON and RICHARD W. STEVENSON

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 26 

 BODY:
The special counsel in the C.I.A. leak inquiry met for more than three hours with the federal grand jury on Wednesday and later talked privately with the district judge in the case as the White House waited out another day in the expectation of possible indictments.
 After the grand jury session, the prosecutor, Patrick J. Fitzgerald, discussed the case for about 45 minutes in the chambers of Judge Thomas F. Hogan, the chief judge of the district court who has presided over the leak case, said the judge's administrative assistant, Sheldon L. Snook.
The grand jury deliberations and the special prosecutor's meeting with the judge ratcheted up fears among officials that Mr. Fitzgerald might have obtained an indictment from the grand jury, and was requesting that it be sealed. He could also seek an extension of the grand jury's term, which expires on Friday. Randall Samborn, a spokesman for Mr. Fitzgerald, would not comment on the case. 
 Mr. Fitzgerald, his deputies and the grand jurors arrived at the federal courthouse shortly after 9 a.m. The grand jurors were seen leaving around noon when Mr. Fitzgerald went to Judge Hogan's chambers. 
 Although lawyers in the case said that they expected that Mr. Fitzgerald would announce a decision on charges by Friday, his continuing deliberations chafed the already raw nerves at the White House and raised the possibility that he might need more time to complete his inquiry.
 Mr. Fitzgerald has focused on Karl Rove and I. Lewis Libby Jr., who is Vice President Dick Cheney's chief of staff. Both have been advised that they could be charged with wrongdoing, possibly for false statements to the grand jury about their conversations with reporters.
 Other possibilities are obstruction of justice or perjury charges, and possible violations of the statute that makes it a crime to disclose the identity of a covert intelligence agent. 
 Some lawyers have suggested that Mr. Fitzgerald may also have investigated possible conspiracy charges or violations of an espionage law that makes it illegal to communicate classified information to people not authorized to receive it.
 Mr. Rove and Mr. Libby came to work at the White House as usual on Wednesday morning. .Whether anyone else is at risk of criminal prosecution remains unknown. The C.I.A. officer, Valerie Wilson, was identified in a July 14, 2003, column by Robert D. Novak, the syndicated columnist, and if a government official was Mr. Novak's main source, that official could be charged with violating a law making it illegal to divulge the identity of a covert officer like Ms. Wilson.
 A series of interviews by F.B.I. agents on Monday revived the possibility that Mr. Fitzgerald might be considering such a charge. Several neighbors of Ms. Wilson and her husband, Joseph C. Wilson IV, a former ambassador, were asked whether they knew that Ms. Wilson, also known by her unmarried name, Valerie Plame, had covert status. 
 Several neighbors, some who have known her for years, said they did not know before Mr. Novak's column that she worked for the C.I.A.
 ''They said they were basically tying up loose ends,'' David Tillotson, a next-door neighbor for seven years, said of his interview by two agents. ''They wanted to ask neighbors how well they knew the Wilsons and whether they knew what Valerie did.''
 Mr. Tillotson said he and his wife, Victoria, thought Ms. Wilson was a business consultant and had no idea she worked for the C.I.A.
 In an apparent effort to draw attention away from the investigation -- or at least to occupy himself as he and everyone else in the White House endured the torture of another day's wait -- Mr. Bush kept to a busy schedule of meetings and appearances. He met with his ambassador to Iraq, gave a speech on the economy, sat down with the prime minister of Macedonia and invited Ghana's president in for a quick chat.
 ''We've got a lot of work to do, and so we don't have a lot of time to sit back and think about those things,'' Scott McClellan, Mr. Bush's press secretary, said when asked about the distraction of the investigation.
 Republicans outside the administration said the White House had taken on a bunker mentality, ignoring or dismissing advice on how to deal with fallout from the case and get the administration back on track.
 The uncertainty over Mr. Rove's fate in particular left many Republicans guessing at how the White House might proceed once Mr. Fitzgerald's decision became public. 
 Democrats for their part pressed ahead with their strategy of asserting that the leak case was part of a broader pattern of dishonesty by the administration that had led the nation into war on false pretenses.
 In a speech at Georgetown University, Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts, the Democratic presidential nominee last year, said attacks by the administration on the Wilsons were part of the White House's effort to justify the war even after the intelligence used to portray Saddam Hussein's weapons programs as a threat was proved wrong. 
 ''We don't know yet whether this will prove to be an indictable offense in a court of law, but for it, and for misleading the nation into war, they will be indicted in the high court of history,'' Mr. Kerry said.
 It was not publicly known what Mr. Fitzgerald discussed with the grand jurors. But at this point in the investigation, lawyers in the case said, he was almost certainly addressing them on the subject of indictments.
 Federal grand juries, made up of 23 people, meet in secret. Former prosecutors said that the process of presenting possible charges to a grand jury followed a pattern in which grand jurors, without the prosecution team present, voted on whether to return an indictment. A simple majority is required for an indictment.
 In some instances, a prosecutor may present the panel with a list of charges and ask for a vote. Or, a prosecutor may engage in sometimes lengthy and detailed discussions with grand jurors about evidence and witnesses and even take straw polls on charges in the case. 
 In cases like this one, in which central charges are believed to focus on whether false statements were made by witnesses in their grand jury testimony, a prosecutor may sound out the grand jurors on whether they feel they were deceived. If grand jurors seem to resist the assertion that they were misled, a prosecutor may take it as a sign that a jury might be similarly hard to convince.
 Former colleagues said Mr. Fitzgerald in the past has displayed a patient and cordial manner that grand jurors appreciated. ''He was professional and straightforward,'' said Joshua G. Berman, a former assistant United States attorney in New York who worked closely with him. ''He was meticulous and methodical, and that made it very easy for grand jurors to follow what he was saying.''

SECTION: Section A; Column 1; National Desk; STORM AND CRISIS: THE NEW ORLEANS MAYOR; Pg. 28

LENGTH: 516 words

HEADLINE: Residents Vent Anger at Washington and Share Bad News

BYLINE: By ADAM NOSSITER

DATELINE: NEW ORLEANS, Oct. 26 

 BODY:
Mayor C. Ray Nagin on Wednesday held his first large-scale town meeting since Hurricane Katrina devastated the region, and he got a strong sense of the anger and frustration that still pervade the city two months after the storm. 
 Virtually everyone who spoke complained about blighted houses and damaged neighborhoods, and many loudly booed the federal role in the city's recovery.
Garbage lies uncollected in vast mounds. Utilities are still spotty.
 The schools remain closed, and large numbers of people are having problems with their insurance companies.
 Very little of the anger in the crowded room was directed at the mayor, however, suggesting that his political standing on his own turf may be relatively untouched despite questions over his handling of the crisis. 
 The 500 people who packed a downtown hotel conference room were a motley New Orleans assemblage reminiscent of prestorm days, full of all sorts of advice (build a bigger airport; schedule a January presidential primary in Louisiana). 
 Some of them came from neighborhoods that barely exist anymore. 
 ''My world has crashed for a long time,'' one woman said. ''I want to know what New Orleans can do for me.''
 There was also the cynical humor of a diminished citizenry living in a shellshocked, empty city that has stared near-extinction in the face. 
 ''Nobody is going to be walking up my sidewalk for the next three months,'' a man announced, to laughter, as he asked for a zoning variance for a trailer on his property.
 Mr. Nagin, wearing a New Orleans Saints sweatshirt and looking relaxed, fielded the various complaints with the cool detachment that has been his hallmark throughout Hurricane Katrina and its aftermath.
 To a woman who pointedly offered to take the mayor on a tour of the devastated, largely white and middle-class Lakeview neighborhood -- suggesting that it had been neglected in municipal assistance -- he simply said: ''You got it.''
 But it was a young man who loudly denounced the federal government, and President Bush, rather than Mr. Nagin himself, who drew the loudest applause and cheers of the afternoon. 
 ''I just can't get over the fact that we are the largest port city in the biggest economy in the world and we're still not getting the help we need from the federal government,'' said the man, Vincenzo Pasquantonio, the 24-year-old owner of a cleaning service who lives in the French Quarter. 
 Mr. Pasquantonio complained that talk show hosts were ''referring to my friends in the Ninth Ward as human trash,'' and he drew applause when he said: ''Rebuild those levees, Mr. President. We wouldn't have had this catastrophe if the federal government had been doing its job.''
 The crowd listened soberly as Mr. Nagin delivered unpleasant news at the beginning: no conventions are scheduled, there will be problems for homeowners with no flood insurance, and there is no cash in the city's coffers. 
 But he caught the antigovernment mood of the crowd when he said, ''What I'm starting to realize, ladies and gentlemen, is that Washington is very skeptical about helping us.''

HEADLINE: U.N. Reports Rising Flow of Arms From Syria Into Lebanon

BYLINE: By JOHN KIFNER

 BODY:
Lebanon is facing an ''increasing influx of weaponry and personnel from Syria'' to Palestinian militia groups, a United Nations report said yesterday.
 The report, the second of two United Nations investigations into Syria's interference in Lebanon, said there had been a remarkable turnabout from Syria's long domination there. Damascus removed its troops last spring after 30 years of occupation following mass demonstrations and international pressure over the assassination of former Prime Minister Rafik Hariri.
Still, the report says, Lebanon has not achieved ''tangible results'' in disarming the Palestinians and the Shiite Hezbollah militia or in exerting full control over its territory. 
 The situation remains ''volatile,'' the report warned, citing ''a number of worrying developments affecting the stability of Lebanon, particularly in the form of terrorist acts and the illegal transfer of arms and people across the borders into Lebanon.''
 While couched in diplomatic language, the report's clear implication that the Palestinian groups were acting at the behest of Syria appeared certain to increase pressure building against Damascus in the Security Council. The Council's special investigator issued a report last week saying the slaying of Mr. Hariri had been plotted by top-ranking Syrian and Lebanese intelligence officers, including the powerful brother-in-law of President Bashar al-Assad.
 Mr. Assad has denied that he or his aides had anything to do with the assassination. He sent a letter to France, Britain and the United States early this week promising to prosecute any Syrian implicated by ''concrete evidence.''
 As the report was being released, Lebanese Army commandos backed by tanks were surrounding several Palestinian bases in the Bekaa region --including one manned by a main Syrian-backed group, the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General Command -- and setting up roadblocks near the Syrian border.
 A Lebanese officer, speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to comment, said the military deployment was a tightening of security because of growing fears that the Palestinian militias were smuggling arms from Syria into the Bekaa.
 ''Things aren't like they used to be in that area, and they are a lot more sensitive and need to be heavily guarded,'' the officer said.
 The report issued yesterday, by the United Nations special envoy Terje Roed-Larsen, noted that the Lebanese Army had detained and deported a number of infiltrators of Palestinian origin who carried Syrian identification documents. It said ''Lebanon is witnessing a momentous transformation'' since September, 2004 when the Security Council adopted Resolution 1559 calling for the Syrian withdrawal and the disarmament of armed groups.
 The events ''have led the people of Lebanon to pierce a wall of silence and speak out loudly and clearly,'' it said, adding, ''Taboos of the past have been broken, and matters previously too sensitive to discuss openly are now the subject of open debate.''
 ''Over the past six months, with the first parliamentary elections held after Syria's withdrawal from Lebanon and the formation of a new government, Lebanon has entered a new phase in its history, '' the report said.
 But it also noted a series of assassinations and 14 bombings in the last year, for which Lebanese have widely blamed agents of Syria. ''As a result of such acts, numerous Lebanese political leaders have chosen to spend prolonged periods of time abroad, for fear of their lives,'' it said.
 The report paid particular attention to the mounting tensions between the Lebanese government and the Damascus-backed Palestinian militias.
 ''Such armed groups have enjoyed relative autonomy inside Palestinian refugee camps, which the Lebanese authorities do not generally enter,'' it said.
 ''While there has been no fundamental change in the status of such groups, a variety of recent reports has suggested that there has been an increasing influx of weaponry and personnel from Syria to some of these groups,'' Mr. Roed-Larsen wrote. ''The issue has also been raised with me by a number of senior Lebanese and other officials.''
 The leader of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General Command, Ahmed Jibril, was named last week in the United Nations inquiry into Mr. Hariri's killing in February. It said he was part of the group of Syrian and Lebanese officials who planned and executed the huge truck bomb explosion that killed the popular former prime minister-turned-opposition-figure and 22 others. Mr. Jibril's group acts on behalf of Syria.
 The report noted that the front had issued a statement on Oct. 4 strongly objecting to the ''insistence of certain sides of the Lebanese government'' to ''hastily enforce Resolution 1559.''
 ''The attempt to sacrifice the weapons of the Palestinians of Lebanon in line with Resolution 1559 will not be greeted with silence or compromise,'' the group's statement said, warning that Lebanon's prime minister, Fouad Seniora, would bear ''direct responsibility for the hostile measures against our Palestinian people taken under the cover of a political and media campaign of disinformation.''
 On Oct 7, the Lebanese Army raided ''Syrian-headquartered Palestinian armed groups'' in the Bekaa seizing weapons, and the Palestinians went on a full alert, the report said.
 Mr. Roed-Larsen said he had met in Paris with Mr. Seniora and the Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas, in which both men ''expressed their grave concern over the illegal transfer of arms and people to Palestinian groups in Lebanon.'' Mr. Abbas, however, does not exert any control over the Syrian-backed groups, which are, in fact, his rivals.
 Meanwhile in the diplomatic maneuvering surrounding French and American efforts to put pressure on Syria at the Security Council, Russia said it would block any attempt to impose economic sanctions.
 ''Russia will do everything necessary to stop attempts to introduce sanctions against Syria,'' a Foreign Ministry spokesman, Mikhail Kalmynin, told the Interfax news agency.

HEADLINE: In Hurricane Tax Package, a Boon for Wealthy Donors

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE STROM

 BODY:
A little-noted provision in the tax relief package to aid victims of Hurricane Katrina is shaping up as a windfall for charity and a drain on government coffers.
 It allows donors who make cash gifts to almost any charity by the end of this year to deduct an amount equal to virtually 100 percent of their adjusted gross incomes, double the normal limit of 50 percent of income. The tantalizing prospect has set off a financial scramble among some wealthy donors and charities vying for their dollars.
''I just keep thinking there's got to be a catch, they can't really be doing this,'' said C. Kemmons Wilson Jr., a Memphis businessman whose father was the founder of Holiday Inns Inc.
 Mr. Wilson said that he and his siblings gave away several million dollars a year and that the amount could double this year because of the provision. ''How many sales does the government have?'' he said. ''This is a big sale, and you bet I'm going to go.'' 
 Fund-raisers say Mr. Wilson is one of many wealthy Americans pressing their financial planners in hopes of increasing their giving this year and reducing their tax bills. Some institutions, primarily universities, are encouraging big donors to take advantage of the favorable tax treatment and make sizable gifts or fulfill their pledges. Essentially, some donors may shift into 2005 gifts that would have been made in future years. 
 Because of the strong interest, experts say the government may forgo more tax revenue than Congress anticipated when it passed the legislation. Based on information from 2002 tax returns, Robert F. Sharpe Jr., a fund-raising consultant whose clients include the American Heart Association and the University of California, Los Angeles, estimated that the provision would spur $4 billion to $10 billion in additional giving this year; 2005 giving was already expected to exceed last year's total of $248 billion. 
 Mr. Sharpe said the additional giving would result in $1 billion to $3.5 billion in lost revenue for the Treasury, more than the $819 million Congress anticipated.
 Moreover, some donors may be able to use the provision to take deductions this year for gifts made in past years. When taxpayers have more charitable deductions that they can use in a given year, they may carry them forward to future tax years. This possibility may further dampen tax revenues.
 ''Congress intended this, but I'm not sure they understood how big the tab is going to be,'' said Mr. Sharpe, who has become a national town crier on the issue. ''There are just so many ways a donor can use this bill to maximize their charitable giving.''
 Congress was willing to give up some revenue because it feared that Americans had given so generously to charities working to help tsunami and hurricane disaster victims that they would cut back on their contributions to other organizations, including cultural institutions and schools. 
 Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa and chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, did not express any concerns about the potential cost of the provision in an e-mail response to questions, saying that if it was spurring a surge of giving, it was working as intended.
 ''After 9/11, there was an outpouring of giving to charities involved in responding to that tragedy, but unfortunately, many other charities saw a significant downturn in donations,'' Mr. Grassley said. ''My hope in passing this provision is that Americans' generosity for those harmed by Hurricane Katrina won't mean a tradeoff for other important charitable work in this country.''
 But fund-raising experts have long said that the decline in charitable giving that followed the Sept. 11 attacks was smaller than nonprofit groups led the public to believe and driven more by economic factors than by exhausted donors.
 ''After 9/11, 65 percent of our members were raising the same or more, and the following year, the numbers went up again,'' said Paulette V. Maehara, president of the Association of Fundraising Professionals. ''There wasn't the sky-is-falling impact that a lot of people thought there would be, and there won't be now, either, unless the economy does a nosedive.''
 Universities, long known as the nonprofit world's savviest fund-raisers, have been the biggest promoters of the provision. ''We're trying to get the word out to as many as we can,'' said Jack Murphy, senior trust officer at Cornell University.
 Not all charities are rushing to take advantage of the provision. ''You don't want to appear to be greedy or inappropriate,'' said Arthur J. Ochoa, senior vice president for community relations at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles. ''The legislative intent was drawn more broadly, but if you asked members of Congress what they were voting for, they would say relief for the Katrina victims. We don't want to appear to be trading on that.''
 Cedars-Sinai has done no explicit marketing of the provision, Mr. Ochoa said, but it is in discussions with one donor who may accelerate a gift because of it. 
 Many other charities, particularly smaller ones, have been slow to understand the provision, fund-raisers say. ''The thing that has surprised me is that I have not heard yet from any of the nonprofits I have supported over the years, and time is running out,'' said Frank P. Wendt, who built Nuveen Investments into a Wall Street powerhouse and is now retired. ''A lot of them don't seem to know about it.''
 Mr. Wendt was alerted to the potential tax benefit by his tax adviser at U.S. Trust. He said he did not yet know how he would use it. ''I'm certainly going to take advantage of it to the maximum amount I'm able to,'' he said.
 He was uncertain how much additional money he could give, however, because he had not fully deducted for gifts in years past.
 Charities are focusing largely on wealthy older individuals like Mr. Wendt, whose incomes may be small relative to their assets. This week, for example, the AARP Foundation will send a brochure explaining the provision to 25,000 of its biggest donors, a tiny slice of the 35 million members of AARP.
 ''The reality is that this is targeted to the high-net-worth audience for all intents and purposes,'' said Monica Estabrooke, the foundation's gift-planning officer. 
 Financial advisers who work with wealthy people are trying to guide their clients on how to use the provision. 
 ''I talked to two people just yesterday about that topic,'' said Vaughn Henry, an estate planner in Springfield, Ill. ''It's not for everybody, but there are some people who are sure kicking it around.''
 Because fund-raisers never know where the next gift might come from, AARP will also inform its entire membership of the provision in the December issue of its magazine.
 ''I heard from an elderly gentleman who is going to get $500,000 and doesn't want to pay taxes on it,'' Ms. Estabrooke said. ''His income isn't so high, so normally he would have to carry the deduction forward for a number of years, but this changes things for him.''
 Ms. Estabrooke and other experts say there are several caveats for donors. Gifts to private foundations and other concerns controlled by donors do not qualify for the additional deduction. Wealthy individuals could incur a 1 percent to 2 percent tax liability for charitable gifts financed by withdrawals from individual retirement accounts. 
 ''We have some concerns about mass marketing this to the rank and file,'' said Ed John, vice president of planned giving at the United Way of America. ''For some middle- to lower-income donors, taking money out of an IRA to donate more could increase their taxable income and tax rate.''
 Christopher R. Hoyt, a professor of tax law at the University of Missouri-Kansas City, said donors also needed to consider their state tax liability because some states did not allow charitable deductions that were allowed at the federal level.
 ''I suspect this will produce relatively few additional gifts,'' Mr. Hoyt said, ''but of much bigger dollars.''

HEADLINE: A Regional Bank Ripe for the Picking

BYLINE: By ERIC DASH

 BODY:
For years, regional banks have been seen as powerhouse performers, and Fifth Third Bank of Cincinnati was once the leader of the pack. Its earnings far outpaced the industry and its strong stock price allowed it to snap up weaker peers.
 Now, regulatory troubles and disappointing deposit growth have reversed its fortunes and its sagging stock price, down 43 percent since its high in March 2002, has made the company a takeover target itself. 
One analyst has called Fifth Third the ''most attractive acquisition candidate in the banking industry.'' A report last week suggested that U.S. Bancorp and Wells Fargo might already be licking their chops.
 Fifth Third executives dismiss a potential sale as rumor. ''We are really focused at growing the businesses that we have,'' said George A. Schaefer Jr., the bank's chief executive for the last 16 years. 
 Still, there is no question that management is concerned about the bank's current performance, and Mr. Schaefer, an Army Ranger during the Vietnam War, is aggressively trying to get the company back on track. Fifth Third is focused on improving service, reining in expenses and expanding its 1,100 branches deeper in places like Pittsburgh and St. Louis as well as faster-growing markets like Chicago and South Florida. But is time running out?
 ''This is a very different company than what it was a couple of years ago,'' said Richard X. Bove, the banking analyst with Punk, Ziegel, who says the bank is takeover bait. ''It is still competing on price, but is attempting to add service. It doesn't have the cost advantage that it once had. And it has made the fundamental decision to move into growth markets as opposed to its traditional approach to gain market share in existing markets.''
 Fifth Third, the nation's 11th-largest bank, had earned Wall Street's respect with 15 percent earnings growth rates for years. With a strong share price, it attracted talented managers with stock options instead of large salaries and passed part of the cost savings to customers through better prices on deposits and loans. Throughout the 1990's, it expanded rapidly, growing from a bank with $8 billion in assets in 1990 to almost $105 billion in 2005.
 What it did not do, however, was invest heavily in its back-office systems and internal controls. Those decisions came back to haunt Fifth Third in September 2002, when it took a $54 million charge after improperly accounting for some mortgage-backed security investments.
 Two months later, the Securities and Exchange Commission stepped in to scrutinize the books. Federal and state banking regulators halted all acquisitions and branch openings while they conducted similar reviews.
 The regulatory actions forced the bank to improve its accounting procedures, triple its audit staff and reshuffle its executive ranks. Of its 14 top officers in 2002, only half remain at Fifth Third and the bank has gone through two chief financial officers in two years. 
 ''We were really too comfortable with the way we had done business,'' said Neal E. Arnold, an executive vice president who was chief financial officer during the regulatory review. ''It's never fun to sit down and look at your organization and decide that you need to upgrade some positions.''
 The acquisition ban was lifted in the spring of 2003 and the company was able to build its own branches a little sooner. Still, it was a costly distraction that allowed other competitors, like KeyCorp and National City, to gain ground.
 ''The worst of the deterioration is probably over,'' said Denis Laplante, a banking analyst with Keefe, Bruyette & Woods in New York. ''We are within a couple of quarters of seeing a turnaround.''
 Fifth Third has remained committed to its decentralized management strategy, which it contends allows for faster and more flexible decision in local markets. Each of its 19 regions has its own independent president and board. But the bank recently retooled its retail strategy as customer deposit levels have slowed. Among the problems, executives concede, was that its pricing strategy was wrong.
 Over the last few years, branch managers hoped to bring in new customers by offering temporary teaser rates that were often more than three times what competitors next door were paying. But when the promotional rates went away after a few months, their customers did, too.
 ''The rates got so out of whack that after the teaser rate went away, the customer felt they didn't have a good value,'' said Kevin T. Kabat, who heads Fifth Third's retail unit. This summer, Fifth Third overhauled its deposit strategy to focus on building stronger customer relationships with lower and steadier rates. It also began closely tracking the daily and weekly sales of its staff. 
 Still, the bank's management faces considerable headwinds as it tries a major turnaround. Across the industry, higher interest rates and tougher competition are starting to squeeze profit margins. The deposit inflow and home mortgage booms of recent years are expected to slow. And a big portion of Fifth Third's branches are in Ohio and Michigan, where the American automobile industry is most concentrated. That makes it particularly vulnerable to an economic decline.
 Mr. Schaefer remains undeterred and says the mix of businesses and locations will allow the bank to brave any economic storm. ''The auto industry is a big concern,'' he acknowledged. ''But if you look here, Cincinnati is the headquarters of the Japanese auto industry, and they are booming.''
 Besides, as Mr. Arnold put it: the regulatory actions led the company to hasten the pace of change. ''We often say around here, 'We haven't seen the Celtics in the N.B.A. championships,' '' he said. ''You have got to reassess.''

HEADLINE: Government Finds Evidence Of a Softer Housing Market

BYLINE: By VIKAS BAJAJ

 BODY:
Sales of new homes rose in September from the previous month, but prices dropped and the number of homes for sale increased, the government reported yesterday, in another sign of some softening in the housing market.
 New home sales in September rose 2.1 percent from August, to an annual rate of 1.22 million, but that was slightly below sales in September 2004, the Commerce Department said. The median price -- at which half the homes sold for more and half for less -- fell 5.7 percent from August, to $215,700. Still, prices were up 1.9 percent from a year earlier. Also, the August home sales figure was lowered to 1.197 million from the 1.237 million reported initially.
In September, homes on the market rose 3.1 percent, to 493,000, a 4.9-month supply. That was up slightly from August and almost 20 percent from September 2004. 
 Sales were strongest in the Midwest, up 24.9 percent from August, and the South, up 5.6 percent. In the Northeast, the region with the least new-home-building activity, sales were down 20 percent, and in the West they were down 11.8 percent.
 The report came two days after the National Association of Realtors said sales of existing homes were unchanged in September. New and existing home sales data do not move in tandem because the Realtors count an existing home as sold when a contract is closed, while new home sales are counted when the contract is signed. New home sales make up 15 percent of the market.
 Economists said both sales reports showed that the housing market had lost some steam this fall but remained at an elevated level.
 ''It's certainly consistent with the idea that the upturn has ended,'' James O'Sullivan, an economist at UBS, said.
 Since home sales hit records this summer, mortgage rates have climbed steadily -- reaching a national average of 6.15 percent for 30-year fixed-rate loans this week, up from 5.53 percent at the end of June, according to Freddie Mac. The Mortgage Bankers Association said on Wednesday that its weekly index of loan volume was down 7.9 percent for the week that ended Oct. 21.
 ''We are definitely headed for record home sales in 2005,'' David F. Seiders, the chief economist at the National Association of Home Builders, said in a statement. ''However, the pattern of sales in recent months suggests that the new home market may have tapped out around midyear, a conclusion consistent with findings from our builders surveys.''
 But even stabilization in home sales could affect the economy, analysts say, because rapidly rising home sales and mortgage refinancing have driven up consumer spending and generally made people more well off. ''This has important implications for overall growth,'' Mr. O'Sullivan said.
 Separately, durable goods orders fell 2.1 percent in September, after jumping 3.8 percent in August, according to the Commerce Department, as orders for military equipment and airplanes dropped. Excluding the transportation sector, orders for durable goods -- those that last more than three years -- fell 1 percent last month.
 Daniel J. Meckstroth, chief economist of Manufacturers Alliance/MAPI, a research and consulting group, said September was unusual because of a strike at Boeing and Hurricane Katrina. 
 Also, the Labor Department reported yesterday that claims for unemployment insurance fell to 328,000 last week, from 356,000 the week before, as applications from people displaced by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita continued to drop. Jobless claims dropped by 24,286 in Louisiana and 7,336 in Mississippi.

HEADLINE: Chinese Milestone: A Major Bank Goes Public

BYLINE: By DAVID BARBOZA

DATELINE: HONG KONG, Oct. 27 

 BODY:
The China Construction Bank, fresh from raising $8 billion in a feverish initial public offering, saw those shares put in only a lukewarm performance in their first day of trading on Thursday.
 The much-anticipated offering was China's biggest ever, and the largest worldwide in four years. And despite the tepid performance, the offering helped transform the China Construction Bank, the country's third-biggest lender, into a full-fledged behemoth valued at about $70 billion -- even greater than Morgan Stanley, the Wall Street giant that helped take the company public.
Investors, who had paid a rich price to be part of the sale, hesitated to take the stock any higher Thursday. More than 39 million shares changed hands on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, but the price barely moved, ending unchanged at 2.35 Hong Kong dollars (30 cents). 
 The offering marked a watershed in the Chinese government's effort to transform its financial markets and reform banks that many analysts derided as corrupt and backward.
 After years of government bailouts, regulations, extensive organizational overhauls and scandals, China's once derelict state-owned banks are now luring billions of dollars from foreign investors.
 Indeed, the China Construction Bank is not without problems itself. This year, the chairman of the bank resigned after being accused of taking bribes. But the bank also disclosed just before the offering that in the last year and a half its employees engaged in more than 100 criminal acts involving more than $60 million.
 Analysts say the bank's recent restructuring and its public offering suggest that China is finally serious about banking reform and is determined to create a more transparent and sophisticated financial services and capital market system.
 That financial system -- fueled by huge foreign trade surpluses and ballooning foreign currency reserves -- is becoming vital to the global economy.
 ''It would be hard to overestimate this as a first step for China,'' said Nicholas R. Lardy, a senior fellow at the Institute for International Economics in Washington. ''If China can transform its big banks, this will have enormous implications for China's long-term economic growth.'' 
 The offering is expected to help the bank's top investors: Bank of America, which paid $3 billion this year for a 9 percent stake in the bank; and Temasek Holdings, the investment company controlled by the Singapore government, which paid about $1.4 billion for a 6 percent stake. Those stakes are now worth much more.
 For Wall Street the deal could not be much sweeter. Morgan Stanley, one of the main underwriters, could earn up to $80 million in fees. Its joint-venture partner in China, the investment bank China International Capital, as well as Credit Suisse First Boston, which helped underwrite the deal, are also expected to earn multimillion-dollar fees.
 Wall Street firms are avidly competing to underwrite other big banking deals in China, and foreign investors have been clamoring to buy minority stakes in state-owned Chinese banks, which restrict foreign ownership to about 25 percent. In the last two years, foreign investors have plowed more than $17 billion into China's state banking sector.
 Also among the winners in the China Construction offering was the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, which has participated in some of world's biggest initial public offerings this year and is riding the wave of China fever. Trying to compete, the New York Stock Exchange and the Nasdaq stock market have recently stepped up recruiting in China.
 The China Construction Bank is the first of China's big four state-owned banks to publicly list its shares with overseas investors. Already one of the world's biggest banks, it has more than $500 billion in assets and reported a profit of more than $6 billion.
 Two other state banks -- the Bank of China and the Industrial & Commercial Bank of China -- are to go public in the next two years. Both have lined up major foreign investors, including the Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs.

HEADLINE: When Winning the Battle Leads to Losing the War

BYLINE: By Jenny Anderson

 BODY:
ACTIVIST investors, be careful what you wish for. 
 Nearly a year ago, Steel Partners, a hedge fund that has made a name for itself shaking up boards to unlock shareholder value, thought it saw a big fat target in BKF, a publicly traded asset management company. Steel Partners, later joined by Cannell Capital, a hedge fund based in San Francisco, waged a proxy fight against BKF, a fight that turned nasty.
 For six months it lobbied for accountability from management, lower compensation for money managers and improved corporate governance standards. In June, the activists won three seats on the board, and by August, BKF's chief had resigned. 
 It was a pyrrhic victory. Any value that was unlocked at BKF seems to be running for the exits. BKF has disclosed that more than $7 billion of the company's $12.4 billion in assets could be gone by year-end.
 Shares of BKF have fallen 39 percent since Steel started the crusade last December. The firm has lost 56 percent of its funds. Whether BKF can now survive is a question. But a greater mystery is why investors who are money managers themselves failed to see how important it is for such a company to hold onto its managers and money.
 The activists had legitimate complaints, but they waged a nasty battle that seems to have prevented them from seeing how much of the money was tied to two managers.
 ''If the incumbent management had worked with the activists, it could have worked better, it could have been a win-win situation'' said Phillip Goldstein, another BKF shareholder. ''Instead they took a scorched-earth policy.'' 
 BKF is a publicly traded company that operates through John A. Levin & Company, an asset management company founded in 1982 by John A. Levin, a 66-year-old Wall Street money manager. John A. Levin & Company had $13.6 billion under management at the end of 2004. But on revenue of $126.5 million, the firm had an operating margin of just 4 percent. By comparison, T. Rowe Price had a 41 percent operating margin in 2004; Gabelli Asset Management, 39 percent. 
 Activists seized on that gap and called for overhaul. Steel Partners and Cannell Capital took on BKF's board, which included such luminaries as Burton G. Malkiel, author of ''A Random Walk Down Wall Street''; a Princeton economics professor, Anson Beard, who once ran equities at Morgan Stanley and was one of the firm's former executives who campaigned for the ouster of Philip J. Purcell; and Barton M. Biggs, a former chief global strategist at Morgan Stanley who now runs his own hedge fund (Mr. Malkiel was voted off the board in June).
 ''A culture of greed and self-dealing has run amok,'' wrote J. Carlo Cannell, managing member of Cannell Capital. He wrote in June, quoting Cicero, ''When is there to be an end of that unbridled audacity of yours, swaggering about as it does now?'' 
 After securing three board seats, the elimination of poison-pill protections and eventually forcing the departure of John Levin -- the manager whose name was on the door -- the activists seemed to have achieved their goal. 
 Then, earlier this month, BKF announced that, because of the pending departure in 2006 of its manager, Mr. Levin's son Henry, it was shuttering a fund that generated nearly half the firm's revenues. The floodgates had opened.
 John A. Levin & Company invests in stocks for individuals and institutions like pension funds and endowments, an approach known as long only. It also invests hedge fund money in a number of strategies.
 According to regulatory filings, as of June 30, 2005, John Levin had $8.8 billion in long only, on which the firm earned 30 to 40 basis points in 2004, and $3.5 billion in alternative assets, or hedge fund money, on which the firm earned 1 percent to 1.5 percent, as well as incentive fees standard to the industry. 
 According to notes in that filing and a later one on Oct. 18, the company said that about $7 billion in its funds were expected to exit the firm, including $2.5 billion that Mr. Levin is entitled to take to his next venture, and an additional $2.4 billion from investors who had said they were pulling out. Those two losses would leave $3.9 billion of the original $8.8 billion of long-only accounts, with their thin margins. 
 The future of the alternative strategies money looks worse. In September, BKF said $925 million was expected to leave the alternative strategies side of the business. It would also close the $460 million short-biased fund -- a fund that bets that the price of stocks will fall -- because it was run by John Levin. In all, about $836 million of the original $3.5 billion appears to remain in the alternative strategies. 
 ''Under its new chief executive the firm is focused on rebuilding its talent and levels of assets under management,'' a BKF spokesman said. ''Importantly, it has ample funds, in excess of $50 million of liquid assets, with which to do so.''
 There's potentially more to leave. John A. Levin & Company manages $2.1 billion in wrap accounts in its long-only strategies. About $1.6 billion of those funds belong to Merrill Lynch. While Merrill will not comment, the chances are that a big conservative firm like Merrill whose reputation is built around preserving an individual's wealth is not going to count on a firm that is bleeding talent and money for asset preservation.
 Neither Steel Partners nor Cannell returned calls for comment. 
 The money that remains is mostly long only, or the low-margin variety. All of which makes it very hard to understand the shareholder value that now remains.

HEADLINE: A Second Home in Bulgaria? 

BYLINE: By DENNY LEE

 BODY:
IT wasn't because the Hamptons were too flashy or the Catskills too sleepy that Aaron Hicklin ended up in Croatia. Nor was it simply the cachet of owning a vacation home in Europe.
 ''I didn't want to go somewhere obvious,'' said Mr. Hicklin, 36, the editor in chief of Black Book magazine, who lives in Brooklyn. So instead of a seaside cottage in the south of France, he and his partner, Ilya Marritz, 28, a radio producer, bought a 19th-century stone house last year on the lavender-scented island of Hvar off Dalmatia.
''It's the new European Riviera,'' Mr. Hicklin said. ''There's even a celebrity element here, though that's not why we went. Croatia is still relatively undeveloped. And it's relatively dirt cheap.''
 Forget the Tuscan villa, the chateau in Provence and the pied-a-terre in Paris. They're so cliche, not to mention overpriced. Savvy second-home hunters are packing their passports, pouring through foreign classified ads and snapping up homes in far-flung countries from Argentina and Bulgaria to Nicaragua and Turkey. 
 Even though these places may lack the glamour of Cannes and are sometimes harder to get to than Timbuktu, they are picturesque, not overrun by Americans and, in some cases, even fashionable. Best of all, there are still bargains to be found. 
 Mr. Hicklin, for example, paid $65,000 for his two-bedroom cottage in Croatia. In Nicaragua, a new beachfront house goes for as little as $170,000. And in downtown Buenos Aires, $85,000 buys a one-bedroom duplex in Recoleta, one of the city's smarter districts. Try finding a broom closet for that price in Miami Beach or, for that matter, the Fourth Arrondissement of Paris. 
 ''There's nothing available at that price,'' said David Michonski, the chief executive of Coldwell Banker Hunt Kennedy, a real estate firm in New York, and a specialist in international real estate. ''Americans, for the first time in history, are looking abroad for second homes. It's not just Tuscany or England, where the rich have always gone.''
 The trend is just starting to emerge, as low interest rates and rising property values at home, cheaper air travel and the globalization of the housing market have prompted Americans to canvass the planet for vacation homes beyond the tourist beltway. In addition, baby boomers are better-traveled than their parents and think nothing of sinking money into foreign soil, especially as the domestic market seems to be overheating.
 ''Real estate has enjoyed a boom for the past five years, and it's spilled over internationally,'' said Jeff Hornberger, the manager of international business development for the National Association of Realtors in Washington. ''Someone who bought a house for $300,000, that's now worth $600,000, may want to downsize and get a second home. But when they see the prices in Florida, they start looking overseas.'' 
 That is basically how Marie Munday, 50, a deputy sheriff from Aspen, Colo., ended up as an international snowbird. As her house tripled in value over the last decade, she began condo shopping in Florida, but the prices were still beyond her reach. So she got off the beaten path and landed in Panama. 
 For $54,000, she and her husband, Chip Munday, 49, a property manager, bought a half acre last month in Altos del Maria, a new second-home community in the mountains of Panama, about 90 minutes from Panama City. ''We hope to do a high-end home with a vanishing-edge pool,'' Ms. Munday said. ''Labor here is pretty cheap. High-end construction is about $65 a foot. In Aspen, the norm is $400.'' 
 ''The first wave was Costa Rica, Mexico and Thailand, but those countries got expensive; now there's a second wave,'' said Matthew Atlee, the editor of Escape From America Magazine. The magazine is published online by EscapeArtist.com, a Web site based in Panama about living abroad, which started in 1996 and gets about 8.5 million visits a month. In Central America, the spillover has prompted real estate agents to call Panama, Honduras and Nicaragua, the ''next Costa Ricas.'' In Europe, there is already talk of Croatia's being overpriced, as Bulgaria and Romania are promoted as the undiscovered hot spots. And in Asia, Americans are no longer ghettoized in well-traveled places like Bali and the beach resorts of Thailand but are branching out into Malaysia, the Philippines and the mountainous reaches of Thailand around Chiang Mai. 
 Even the Middle East is up for grabs. ''Dubai is a nice blend of the Middle East and America,'' said Adil Samad, 24, a graduate student from Buffalo whose family recently bought a $600,000 three-bedroom condominium in the planned Trident Grand Residence, an apartment tower overlooking the Persian Gulf. ''We considered Miami, India and California. But Dubai is extremely safe and 30 percent cheaper.'' 
 WITH the notable exception of Africa, hot zones like Iraq and Afghanistan and restricted spots like Cuba, few corners of the world seem to be off limits to intrepid home buyers anymore. 
 ''What's a verboten place?'' asked Mr. Michonski of Coldwell Banker. ''I can't think of one. We're seeing this happening around the world. London plumbers are buying places in Portugal. Europeans are buying in Florida. Greece is on the verge of a huge boom. It's identical to global trade. In fact, they're tied together.''
 For one thing, real estate listings are no longer a local commodity. Not long ago, a tourist might have stumbled upon a ''for sale'' flier at a local cafe. Today, all one needs to do is plug a country name and the words ''real estate'' into a computer search engine to see what's available. That even works for places as hard to travel to as Fiji, which is about a 10-hour flight from Los Angeles. 
 ''I had over 100,000 hits and 200 people e-mail me in the first month,'' said John Knox, 45, a land surveyor from Costa Mesa, Calif., who listed his Fiji bungalow on EscapeArtist.com in June. Last month, a British couple bought the property, a two-bedroom house on the volcanic island of Taveuni, for $55,000. ''Now I'm trying to find a place in Croatia, maybe Montenegro.'' 
 The process for buying overseas has also become less risky, as the financial and legal institutions that make it possible for people to own second homes are increasingly transparent, global and linked. That is not to say there are no pitfalls. In many countries, there is little legal protection for home buyers should the deal sour. Mortgages for foreigners are nearly impossible to obtain, and the mechanism for transferring titles can be downright Kafkaesque.
 ''The nightmare scenario is the guy you meet at the bar who sells you a house, but doesn't actually own it,'' said Lief Simon, the chief financial officer of International Living, a Web site started by Americans in Ireland about buying property overseas. Mr. Simon also runs seminars that promote overseas real estate to investors.
 Some countries restrict foreigners from owning land. Mexico, for example, prohibits Americans from buying property within 31 miles of the coast. Similar restrictions are found in Thailand, Croatia and much of Central America.
 But as countries recognize the value of the second-home market, ownership rules are being relaxed. Or at least bent. In Mexico, Americans can now buy beachfront property through what is known as a ''fidecomiso,'' a title-holding trust. In Croatia, homeowners form a local corporation. And in Thailand, where foreigners are barred from owning more than 49 percent of a property, buyers have developed a kind of corporate shell game to give themselves control of their properties. 
 Maintaining a home overseas is also becoming easier. The peace of mind afforded by title insurance, once a rarity in less-developed regions, is becoming standard. Financing for foreigners is available in a growing number of countries, including Panama, Mexico, New Zealand and, soon, Croatia. And a cottage industry of rental and caretaker agencies has sprouted to meet a budding demand. 
 SOME countries are going so far as to court American buyers. In Dubai, the local emirates designated broad strips of land as freehold, or private property, in 2002 to lure developers. Malaysia recently started a program that allows foreigners who buy property to apply for renewable five-year visas.
 ''The borders for second homes are falling,'' said AJ Janoyan, 35, a lawyer from Emeryville, Calif., who has second homes in Lebanon, Argentina and, as of last year, Armenia. He is now in the market for something in Croatia and Bulgaria. ''There are lots of opportunities before these places convert to the euro. I think it's all open season.''
 Like many foreign homeowners, Mr. Janoyan treats his vacation properties as an investment. He visits only a few times a year. To help pay for the scattered homes, he has a business partner and rents out the properties to vacationers through local agents. ''It's all about discovering new places and having a great time while we make money,'' he said. ''The X-factor is no longer the distance, but how reputable the local people are.'' 
 Some economists, however, worry that the global buying frenzy is exporting the American real estate boom to other countries. Robert J. Shiller, a professor of economics at Yale, cautions that vacation home destinations tend to be driven by fashion and, therefore, are more vulnerable to bubbles. He calls them ''glamour properties.'' 
 But Suzanne Halmer is not the least bit concerned. A teacher's assistant in Los Angeles, Ms. Halmer postponed her dreams of a Paris apartment and, instead, paid 22,000 euros (about $27,000) this year for a 400-square-foot studio in Bulgaria. It is part of a new resort called Sunny Beach, near the old town of Nesebur, that looks like a mini-Florida development on the Black Sea. 
 ''Five years from now, it's going to be worth 85,000 euros,'' said Ms. Halmer, 47, who also owns a ski condo in Park City, Utah. ''I'm not crazy about Bulgaria, but I'm crazy about the prices.''

HEADLINE: A Virtual Holiday In the Virtual Sun

BYLINE: By MARK WALLACE

 BODY:
IMAGINE relaxing in a tiny private cove, on a lava beach near the mists of a waterfall. The sun is shining, a tropical bird cries somewhere in the distance and the cares of the working world seem a million miles away.
 It's an idyllic vacation spot, but the best thing about it is that it takes less than five minutes to get there from anywhere in the world. In fact, you can reach it without ever leaving your home. That's because it exists not in any physical location but in one of the many virtual worlds that millions of people now travel to every day with the help of nothing more than a decent computer graphics card and a broadband Internet connection.
Though most of these worlds take the form of multiplayer online games like World of Warcraft or Star Wars Galaxies, a few are simply open 3-D environments whose members can get away from it all in a place filled with colorful diversions and other cyberexplorers like themselves. Even in game worlds, many players log on not to slay orcs or blow up death stars but to spend time with friends, see the sights and take a small vacation without ever stepping foot outside their door. 
 More than 10 million people around the world travel to such imaginary destinations regularly. They get there via software that lets them guide their onscreen representatives, known as ''avatars,'' through places built entirely of pixels where they can interact with one another. Their destinations include virtual dance parties and nightclubs, auto races and yachting events, ''Star Wars''-style cantinas, whimsical underwater jazz clubs and much more.
 In a world called Second Life, especially (where the virtual Hawaii described above can be found), so many people visit that profitable businesses have sprung up that earn their proprietors real money, not just virtual currency -- in fact, a handful of people earn six-figure incomes there. There are discos, casinos and other sites that can be rented for private parties or even for the virtual weddings many people hold.
 ''Coming to Second Life was a nice way to get away from the stresses of real life,'' said Amy McKenzie, a full-time mother of three in Madison, S.D., whose avatar goes by the name Diamond Hope. ''But mostly it's a place I can meet my friends and just have a good time.''
 One California woman, whose avatar is known as SweetBrown1 Mfume, spends many of her after-work and weekend hours socializing with friends in Second Life. (Like most of the people interviewed for this article, the woman asked to be referred to only by her avatar's name. Each person's identity has been verified.) In cyberspace, she said, she can spend time with them no matter their differences in location or time zone. ''We can dance, hug and kiss, all across the U.S.,'' she said.
 Edward Castronova, associate professor of telecommunications at Indiana University, uses a game world in a similar way. He is often away from home at conferences, and from time to time will keep in touch with his wife by meeting up with her in the online game World of Warcraft. To Mr. Castronova, such worlds are more than just games. ''These things are really communications devices,'' he said.
 Entering a world like Second Life is relatively simple. Free trial memberships are available at secondlife.com. Software is downloaded over a cable modem or other broadband connection, and on first entering, new members find themselves at a place called Orientation Island. 
 After a few minutes spent mastering the basic techniques of movement and how to give your avatar a rudimentary makeover, you're released into the wider virtual world to explore the sights and sounds of a place that contains the virtual equivalent of 25 square miles of land and is growing every day.
 PRACTICALLY everything in Second Life's world was created by its residents, who come from 80 countries around the (real) world. Linden Lab, the company that runs Second Life's world, provides a set of content-creation tools that its members have used to create everything from nightclubs and movie theaters to coffee shops and bars to airships, automobiles and clothing stores, a few museums and one or two libraries and nature preserves. 
 The company itself creates practically none of the buildings and other sites in Second Life, but provides only the rolling landscape on which the more ambitious of its members build.
 On FairChang Island, for instance, one of the 1,000-plus ''regions'' of Second Life (each covering 16 virtual acres), a simple mouse-click allows members to purchase virtual sailboats that can be sailed around the waters of the virtual world. Prices start at less than a penny, and the money goes to the ''resident'' who created the item. Payments are made using a virtual currency called ''Linden dollars'' that can be bought and sold freely with real money on eBay and other sites.
 In contrast to most virtual worlds, Linden Lab doesn't mind having its currency bought and sold, and even grants Second Life members ownership of the intellectual property rights to whatever they create in the world. But to create anything of permanence, members must ''own'' a plot of virtual land (on which they must then pay monthly fees). 
 A robust economy has sprung up as a result, with one of the most profitable areas being the virtual real estate business. Large tracts of land can be ''purchased'' at auction in Second Life, often for more than $100 an acre, then subdivided and sold at a profit.
 But that doesn't make for much of a vacation. For a cheaper thrill, free balloon rides are available that take you soaring over those plots of land and the fantastic creations that occupy them. Virtual Nascar races are held several times a week on Silver Island. And there are ad hoc events and other attractions that can be located using the directory function built into the Second Life interface.
 Many regions are more outlandish. The island of Montmartre, for instance, is filled with fantastical sculpture, floating bridges and platforms and playful spaces to explore. And as more people enter the world, new creations spring up (and sometimes are torn down) on a regular basis. One recent addition, Sleezywood, features trailer homes, junkyards and more than one virtual velvet Elvis.
 ''It's very interesting to be inside somebody else's vision of what the world should look like,'' Philip Rosedale, the founder and chief executive of Linden Lab, said. ''Unless you're concerned with taste and smell, Second Life provides an almost perfect canvas for creating escapist environments. It's an incredible tourist destination.''
 For those interested in a more permanent stay, or who just want a sharper outfit for their avatar before venturing onto the virtual dance floor, there are a number of fashion boutiques scattered around the world.
 ''In real life, I love to shop,'' said a member who uses the avatar named Rynah Quinn, and who often shops at the Midnight City Mall. ''Here I get the same satisfaction, but it's more fun because you can pick the colors and it will always fit.'' 
 Others enjoy the many activities on offer. One popular spot is the Neo Realms Fishing Camp in Second Life's Alston region. Created by a team of five residents, Neo Realms lets virtual anglers buy a fishing rod for less than a quarter and then while away the hours casting from the small pier or from lily pads that float nearby. Fishing tournaments with cash prizes are held each week. There is even a Web site (http://fish.neorealms.com) where competitors can check their tournament standings.
 The imposing Moonshine Casino in the Mullett region and the Edge nightclub in the Da Boom region are also among the most popular spots in Second Life, and are often crowded with avatars both day and night. In fact, there's a thriving dating scene in Second Life, and avatars are regularly ''married'' in ceremonies large and small. 
 LIKE most virtual worlds, Second Life also sees its share of cybersex, in which two people will use a private chat channel within the world to type suggestively to each other, a practice that dates from the early days of chat rooms.
 But Second Life adds a visual element to cybersex that chat rooms lack. Poses and animations can be had that allow avatars to engage in all kinds of sexual positions and activities. In addition, there is a virtual sex industry that includes virtual lap dances, virtual escort services and virtual prostitution.
 To guide members in what they can expect, Second Life is divided into ''mature'' regions, where anything goes, and ''PG'' regions, where sexual content and swearing are not allowed. (The world has a minimum age requirement of 18, but for younger cybernauts, Second Life offers a separate ''teen grid'' as well.)
 A smaller club called the Shelter, in the Isabel region, is designed expressly for those new to Second Life and for those looking for a night out free of sexual overtones. 
 ''Being somewhat of a haven is our primary mission,'' said Steve Meyer, a Detroit systems engineer who owns the club. Nothing at the club costs money, and instead of disco, hip-hop and ''escorts,'' the Shelter features pop tunes from the 1980's and 90's to dance to, lotteries, game shows and items like virtual clothing and vehicles, all available free to get people started in the world. And if dancing isn't your thing, there's a pool on the patio to relax in.
 Although many people keep in touch with their real-world loved ones in virtual worlds, some find relationships that develop in the opposite direction. Ms. McKenzie not long ago met a man in Second Life, lthen met him in real life and is now married to him. The couple were married in South Dakota, and plan to have another ceremony online.
 Although worlds like Second Life can be useful for staying in touch or even for forming new relationships, for most people they are simply a casual getaway. 
 ''I like meeting new people, but this is strictly a game for me,'' a member whose avatar is named Gina Fatale said of Second Life. ''Plus, in Second Life I look better.''

HEADLINE: Back Home, Reservists Find Careers Have Been Downsized

BYLINE: By STACEY STOWE; Damien Cave contributed reporting for this article.

 BODY:
Michael Serricchio was an up-and-coming stockbroker, tending $250 million worth of accounts in Connecticut and earning $200,000 a year in salary and commissions. He was also a sergeant in the Air Force Reserve.
 Shortly after Sept. 11, 2001, his unit was called up and he began a two-year deployment that included a stint in Saudi Arabia. When he came back, his company had merged, his clients had been parceled out and there seemed to be no place for him at the newly constituted office of Wachovia Securities.
 Mr. Serricchio said he tried for more than three months to return to work, and when he finally was given a new assignment, it was making cold calls for a $2,000-a-month draw on commission.
 ''It's not like I was in jail,'' said Mr. Serricchio, 33, a reservist for 11 years and father of a 3-year-old girl. ''You feel you should have something. You feel everything should be frozen in time while you're gone.'' 
 Wachovia will not comment on Mr. Serricchio's version of the events, saying that employee matters are confidential and that this complaint could end up in the courts. But the case of Mr. Serricchio points up another of the many complexities involved in fighting a war with a large contingent of National Guard soldiers and reservists -- part-time soldiers who must disrupt their lives to fulfill their military obligation and fill the ranks.
 Even for those who return home from service unharmed, healthy and fully ready to pick up their lives where they left off, re-emerging as a civilian can be tricky. For workers like Mr. Serricchio, it can be even more complicated, according to people familiar with the military and workplace issues.
 A 1994 law, the federal Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act, commonly referred to as Userra, protects against losing a job because of military service. Even so, last year the Department of Defense handled 6,242 cases involving claims of job discrimination, job placement or inadequate pay or vacation, according to Maj. Robert Palmer of the Air Force, the spokesman for the National Committee for Employer Support of the Guard and Reserve, one of two federal agencies that deal with employment complaints. 
 The agency could not provide a breakdown of complaints by profession nor an exact accounting of how the complaints were resolved. 
 ''These are complex issues,'' Major Palmer said. ''Sometimes the Guard and reservists have an unreal expectation of what they are due, and some employers don't know what they're supposed to do.''
 The issue becomes even more complicated when it comes to those who step off the corporate ladder for a tour of duty. And there are many of those reservists and guardsmen, the Pentagon says. Of the 500,000 reservists and guardsmen called up in the last four years, about one-third are in professional careers.
 Many are people who leave behind clients and patients and accounts. In their absence, certifications can lapse, clients and patients can migrate elsewhere and sales territories can be poached. ''I've heard stories of attorneys in big law firms who are deployed and when they return'' their clients have been given to another lawyer, said Kevin P. Flood, a retired Navy lawyer. ''The problem is out there, but I don't know how Userra can prevent what happens when you have people in partnerships or senior management experiencing difficulties.''
 Representative Robert E. Andrews, a Democrat from New Jersey and a member of the personnel subcommittee of the House Armed Services Committee, said he had received almost a dozen complaints from constituents who are white-collar reservists. One of his constituents is an associate at a law firm who believes his deployment took him off the partnership track. ''Technically, that might not be a violation, but these people are smart, they're not going to write a memo saying that military service might be the cause,'' Representative Andrews said.
 In Mr. Serricchio's case, a bumpy stock market and the 2003 merger of his company, Prudential Financial, with Wachovia, further clouded an already murky work environment. While Prudential paid him $5,000 a month during his first year of deployment, far beyond what the law requires, he said he was forbidden to contact his clients, his name was taken off the accounts and he heard his clients were either dropped or doled out to other brokers. He said he called Prudential twice and Wachovia once during his deployment to question the removal of his name from his accounts but said he was told he was not actively working for the companies.
 Mr. Serricchio also said that, without notifying him, Prudential settled a legal claim against him by a client who had accused him of forging a document. Settling such a legal case without notifying a reservist is illegal under the Soldiers' and Sailors' Civil Relief Act, Mr. Flood said. Mr. Serricchio now has a mark on his record he insists is without merit.
 Mr. Serricchio said that when he returned from active duty in November 2003, he asked his lawyer, David S. Golub, to notify the company that he was ready to get back to work. But it took 120 days until Mr. Serricchio was welcomed to the Westport office of Wachovia.
 By then, he said, just four of his original clients remained and he was handed a book of dormant accounts and offered $2,000 a month that had to be repaid out of his commissions. He balked and told his manager that he would contact his lawyer, Mr. Golub. Three days later, he said, the company sent him a letter informing him that he had ''voluntarily resigned.'' Mr. Serricchio said he intended to sue.
 Tony Mattera, a spokesman for Wachovia Securities, said he could not speak about Mr. Serricchio. ''We are dealing with his attorney and through the appropriate channels,'' Mr. Mattera said. ''Also, some issues predate our merger.''
 Jim Gorman, a spokesman for Prudential, said he was unaware of any complaints from Mr. Serricchio.
 Glenn Gotz, an economist at the Institute for Defense Analyses, a federally financed research organization, said it was often hard to prove that military service led to a job setback. ''If companies want to get around Userra,'' said Mr. Gotz, who has studied the issue extensively, ''in terms of promotion and hiring, they can.''
 But one returning reservist in Colorado who claimed he was a victim of job discrimination won a lawsuit against his former employer, Agilent Technologies. Judge Lewis T. Babcock said that Lt. Col. Joseph S. Duarte, a Marine reservist, had ''paid a steep price for his military deployment'' when he was fired from a job he had held for 19 years shortly after his return from active duty in July 2003. 
 The company claimed that it had shrunk its work force by 28,000 and that Colonel Duarte's dismissal was not related to either his performance or military service. But the judge ordered Agilent to pay Colonel Duarte, of Littleton, Colo., $380,000.
 ''It went way beyond money for me,'' said Colonel Duarte, 50, who sued after searching for a new job for more than a year. 
 ''I told my wife, I might be sweeping floors somewhere if we lose this but I'm going to fight this in court because I don't want some private or lance corporal to come back, find their job gone, and not have the means to do what I'm doing.''
 Since 2001, the National Association of Securities Dealers has received 760 notifications of people registered with them being called up for active duty. Many who are deployed pass their clients to a colleague, said Bill Singer, a Wall Street lawyer who represents stockbrokers in labor disputes. The reservist and the colleague share in the commissions while the reservist is away. When the reservist returns, he picks up where he left off. But in some cases, clients end up staying with the colleague or moving on.
 ''The problem is that they're being asked to make two sacrifices; one is the sacrifice for their country, putting their life at risk,'' Mr. Singer said. ''Then to some extent there is a penalty being imposed upon them when they return because they are being forced to lose their business.''
 Companies like the American International Group, New York Life Insurance, Bear Stearns, Washington Mutual and the Hartford Financial Services Group pay active-duty reservists a monthly salary that was the average of what they earned for the year before leaving, or the difference between their civilian and military pay for all or part of their deployment.
 Several go beyond the federal law because it's the ''right thing to do,'' said Axel Freudmann, senior vice president for human resources at A.I.G.
 Mr. Mattera, of Wachovia, said about 300 of the company's 90,000 employees have been called to active duty in the last few years. ''Our military leave policy is recognized by the Department of Defense,'' he said, adding that the company was proud of it. He pointed out that the company had received ''dozens of testimonials from Guard and Reserve members.''
 Mr. Serricchio, who now lives in Westfield, Mass., said he would like to get back to the fast-paced arena of stock trading. Instead, he said, he is helping his wife, Maria, with her business, a tanning salon.

HEADLINE: China Luring Foreign Scholars To Make Its Universities Great

BYLINE: By HOWARD W. FRENCH

DATELINE: SHANGHAI, Oct. 26 

 BODY:
When Andrew Chi-chih Yao, a Princeton professor who is recognized as one of the United States' top computer scientists, was approached by Qinghua University in Beijing last year to lead an advanced computer studies program, he did not hesitate.
 It did not matter that he would be leaving one of America's top universities for one little known outside China. Or that after his birth in Shanghai, he was raised in Taiwan and spent his entire academic career in the United States. He felt he could contribute to his fast-rising homeland.
''Patriotism does have something to do with it, because I just cannot imagine going anywhere else, even if the conditions were equal,'' said Dr. Yao, who is 58. 
 China wants to transform its top universities into the world's best within a decade, and it is spending billions of dollars to woo big-name scholars like Dr. Yao and build first-class research laboratories. The effort is China's latest bid to raise its profile as a great power. 
 China has already pulled off one of the most remarkable expansions of education in modern times, increasing the number of undergraduates and people who hold doctoral degrees fivefold in 10 years.
 ''First-class universities increasingly reflect a nation's overall power,'' Wu Bangguo, China's secondranking leader, said recently in a speech here marking the 100th anniversary of Fudan, the country's first modern university.
 The model is simple: recruit top foreign-trained Chinese and Chinese-American specialists, set them up in well-equipped labs, surround them with the brightest students and give them tremendous leeway. In a minority of cases, they receive American-style pay; in others, they are lured by the cost of living, generous housing and the laboratories. How many have come is unclear.
 China is focusing on science and technology, areas that reflect the country's development needs but also reflect the preferences of an authoritarian system that restricts speech. The liberal arts often involve critical thinking about politics, economics and history, and China's government, which strictly limits public debate, has placed relatively little emphasis on achieving international status in those subjects. 
 In fact, Chinese say -- most often euphemistically and indirectly -- that those very restrictions on academic debate could hamper efforts to create world-class universities.
 ''Right now, I don't think any university in China has an atmosphere comparable to the older Western universities -- Harvard or Oxford -- in terms of freedom of expression,'' said Lin Jianhua, Beijing University's executive vice president. ''We are trying to give the students a better environment, but in order to do these things we need time. Not 10 years, but maybe one or two generations.''
 Nonetheless, the new confidence about entering the world's educational elite is heard among politicians and university administrators, students and professors. 
 ''Maybe in 20 years M.I.T. will be studying Qinghua's example,'' says Rao Zihe, director of the Institute of Biophysics at Qinghua University, an institution renowned for its sciences and regarded by many as China's finest university. ''How long it will take to catch up can't be predicted, but in some respects we are already better than the Harvards today.''
 In only a generation, China has sharply increased the proportion of its college-age population in higher education, to roughly 20 percent now from 1.4 percent in 1978. In engineering alone, China is producing 442,000 new undergraduates a year, along with 48,000 graduates with masters' degrees and 8,000 Ph.D's.
 But only Beijing University and a few other institutions have been internationally recognized as superior. Since 1998, when Jiang Zemin, then China's leader, officially began the effort to transform Chinese universities, state financing for higher education has more than doubled, reaching $10.4 billion in 2003, the last year for which an official figure is available.
 Xu Tian, a leading geneticist who was trained at Yale and still teaches there, runs a laboratory at Fudan University that performs innovative work on the transposition of genes. On Aug. 12 his breakthrough research was featured on the cover of the prestigious journal Cell, a first for a Chinese scientist.
 Beijing University drew on the talents of Tian Gang, a leading mathematician from M.I.T., in setting up an international research center for advanced mathematics, among other high-level research centers. Officials at Beijing University estimate that as much as 40 percent of its faculty was trained overseas, most often in the United States.
 The president of Yale University, Richard C. Levin, interviewed in Shanghai, where he was the featured guest at Fudan's centennial celebration in late September, also had high praise for China's students. 
 ''China has 20 percent of the world's population, and it is safe to say it has more than 20 percent of the world's best students,'' he said. ''They have the raw talent.''
 But Mr. Levin also noted that China's low labor costs simplified the effort to upgrade. He said he had been astounded by the new laboratories at Jiaotong University in Shanghai, which he said could be built in China for $50 a square foot, compared with $500 a square foot at Yale.
 Some critics say that the country is trying to achieve excellence in too many areas at once and that the plans of the 30 or so universities selected for heavy state investment duplicate efforts, sacrificing excellence. Even Mr. Levin tempered his enthusiasm with a warning that the ''top schools have expanded much too fast and are diluting quality.''
 In many cases, though, the toughest criticism comes from people who have worked in the system.
 ''It is important for different universities to have different qualities, just like a symphony,'' said Yang Fujia, a nuclear physicist and former president of Fudan. ''But all Chinese universities want to be comprehensive. Everybody wants to be the piano, having a medical school and lots of graduate students.''
 Mr. Yang, who leads a small experimental university in Ningbo, also criticized the lack of autonomy given to many Chinese researchers. 
 ''At Princeton one mathematician spent nine years without publishing a paper, and then solved a problem that had been around for 360 years,'' Mr. Yang said, a reference to Andrew J. Wiles and his solution to Fermat's last theorem in the early 1990's. ''No one minded that, because they appreciate the dedication to hard work there. We don't have that spirit yet in China.''
 Similarly, Ge Jianxiong, a distinguished historical geographer at Fudan, said Chinese culture often demands speedy results, which could undermine research. ''In China projects are always short-term, say three years,'' he said. ''Then they want you to produce a book, a voluminous book. In real research you've got to give people the freedom to produce good results, and not just the results they want.''
 Mr. Ge added that education suffered here because ''it has always been regarded as a tool of politics.''
 Dr. Yao said he had expected to concentrate on creating a world-class Ph.D. program but had found surprising weaknesses in undergraduate training and had decided to teach at that level. ''You can't just say I'll only do the cutting-edge stuff,'' he said. ''You've got to teach the basics really well first.''
 But the biggest weakness, many Chinese academics indicated, is the lack of academic freedom. Mr. Yang, the former president of Fudan University, warned that if the right atmosphere was not cultivated, great thinkers from overseas might come to China for a year or two, only to leave frustrated.
 Gong Ke, a vice president of Qinghua University, said universities had ''the duty to guarantee academic freedom.'' 
 ''We have professors who teach here, foreigners, who teach very differently from the Chinese government's point of view,'' he added. ''Some of them really criticize the economic policy of China.''
 Li Ao, a writer in Taiwan, visited Beijing University in September and gave a speech calling for greater academic freedom and independence from the government. The next day, after reportedly coming under heavy official pressure, he delivered a far tamer version elsewhere. .
 The Chinese government also censors university online bulletin boards and discussion groups, and recently prevented students at Zhongshan University in Guangzhou from conversing freely with visiting elected officials from Hong Kong.
 Students here are not encouraged to challenge authority or received wisdom. For some, that helps explain why China has never won a Nobel Prize. What is needed most now, some of China's best scholars say, are bold, original thinkers.
 ''The greatest thing we've done in the last 20 years is lift 200 million people out of poverty,'' said Dr. Xu. ''What China has not realized yet, though, if it truly wants to go to the next level, is to understand that numbers are not enough.
 ''We need a new revolution to get us away from a culture that prizes becoming government officials. We must learn to reward real innovation, independent thought and genuine scholarly work.''

HEADLINE: Saints Return to Louisiana Amid Much Damage to Repair

BYLINE: By JERE LONGMAN

DATELINE: NEW ORLEANS, Oct. 27 

 BODY:
When the New Orleans Saints play in Louisiana on Sunday for the first time since Hurricane Katrina, Vance Levesque plans to greet the displaced team with a bag on his head.
 The site of the game against the Miami Dolphins will be unfamiliar -- some 75 miles upriver in Baton Rouge, at Louisiana State University -- but Levesque's protest will be recognizable from 1980, when the Saints dropped 15 of 16 games and lost a consonant to ineptitude, becoming derided as the Aints.
 It is not the players to whom Levesque will direct his ire, even though at 2-5 this season and with one playoff victory since beginning play in 1967, the Saints can be relied upon mostly for mediocrity and heartbreak.
 What has infuriated Levesque, and many other fans and city and state officials, is the belief that Tom Benson, the team owner, plans to abandon this crippled city after this season, moving the Saints to San Antonio or Los Angeles in what is viewed as a display of greed, insensitivity and betrayal of a fan base that has stuck by the franchise. 
 ''Let's kick the city when it's down,'' Levesque, 56, a certified public accountant, said with disgust.
 He said he planned to remove the bag from his head Sunday and pass it around so that a few more quarters could be added to Benson's franchise kitty.
 This was an allusion to a much-criticized $186 million subsidy the state of Louisiana had agreed to pay the Saints through 2010 to keep them in New Orleans. It was also a caustic reference to the belief that Benson is more concerned with the bottom line than the goal line, that he would rather stuff his pockets with money than line his trophy case with Super Bowl titles.
 Benson took out full-page advertisements in newspapers in New Orleans and Baton Rouge on Wednesday, saying he wanted the team to remain in New Orleans but adding that ''No decision has been made about the future of the team, because no decision has been made about the future of New Orleans.''
 The Saints became a vagabond team after Hurricane Katrina peeled the roof off the Superdome, sending water pouring into the arena, which was also fouled by the smell of up to 30,000 people sheltered without adequate food, water and toilet facilities. The team is training in San Antonio this season, playing three home games there and four in Baton Rouge. No decisions have been made regarding the 2006 season.
 Several people interviewed here said Benson had every right to explore his options. After all, he did not buy the Saints in 1985 to lose money, making him no different from the tens of thousands of business owners in New Orleans who are reassessing their plans.
 It is impossible to know whether New Orleans will become a vibrantly reconstructed city or a shell of its former self, a kind of civic football helmet without a face mask to protect a team owner from a financial bloody nose. Even before Katrina, New Orleans was not an ideal N.F.L. market, given the relatively small population, an aging stadium and a small number of corporate headquarters.
 What has upset people here is Benson's allowing the Saints' potential departure to become front-page news when residents are demoralized and are looking for optimism and acts of compassion and good citizenship when getting electricity restored remains a chore for many.
 The mayor of New Orleans, C. Ray Nagin, had said that he was appalled by Benson's conspicuous adventuring, that he would not buy a ticket to the Saints and that although he wanted the team to remain in New Orleans, Benson could leave.
 ''I think if Mr. Benson wants to leave, he could have done it a little bit differently," Nagin said in an interview. ''Not right after a major storm when 80 percent of the city is flooded and most of the citizens are gone.''
 Benson, 78, may be as unpopular here as Michael Brown, who resigned as the director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency after what was widely seen as a clumsy response by the federal government to Katrina. Discarded refrigerators have become billboards of frustration, spray-painted with anti-Benson rants, including one that said: ''Tom Benson & X FEMA Director Inside. No Open.''
 It is exasperating to many that Benson, a man with the skill and the personality to have made a fortune in automobile dealerships, has grown so apparently tone deaf toward the supporters of his team.
 ''I don't know whether he is a bastard or a public-relations disaster,'' Gary R. Roberts, director of the sports law program at Tulane Law School, said of Benson, who could not be reached for comment. He will not publicly discuss relocation until after the season, a Saints spokesman said.
 In full-page newspaper advertisements Wednesday, Benson noted that he was born in New Orleans, that he had turned down lucrative offers to sell the Saints ''on numerous occasions'' so that he could keep the franchise here and that ''my desire is to return to New Orleans.''
 At the same time, the mayor of San Antonio, Phil Hardberger, has said his city would pursue the Saints and that he believed Benson wanted to relocate there permanently. 
 The Saints have also fired a team executive who favored returning to Louisiana and have sought to terminate the lease on their practice facility in the suburb of Metairie, La. Louisiana officials are waiting to see whether the Saints will attempt by late November to opt out of their Superdome contract. Because the stadium is unusable for now, the team may try to avoid the mandated refunding of $81 million in state subsidies.
 Oliver Thomas Jr., president of the New Orleans City Council, said Benson should be commended for not moving the team upon his purchase and for his considerable charity work. ''His concerns are legitimate'' regarding the uncertain future of New Orleans, Thomas said.
 But, Thomas added, New Orleans and the Saints are like a couple that has been married for more than 30 years.
 ''The wife has supported the husband when he was unemployed,'' Thomas said. ''One day, the husband gets a job offer in Alaska. The wife is sick, bedridden. She can't move. Does the husband stay with her and nurse her back to health? The right kind of husband wouldn't leave. We're sick right now. We need our spouse to stand by us and hold our hand while we get our health back.''
 It is time for all parties to stop sniping at each other through the news media and to meet, Thomas said. Gov. Kathleen Babineaux Blanco of Louisiana hopes to meet with Benson and Paul Tagliabue, commissioner of the National Football League, this weekend in Baton Rouge.
 Demonizing Benson could sabotage the chances of the Saints' returning to New Orleans, said Marc Ganis, president of the Chicago sports consulting firm Sportscorp Ltd. ''If you criticize the man enough, as has been going on with Mayor Nagin, you'll get a situation where, if the Saints come back, who's going to buy tickets?'' Ganis said. ''The man has been bashed to the point where it may make the environment an impossible place to operate.''
 Parties make up after bitter negotiations all the time, according to Roberts. What would determine the Saints' future in New Orleans would be the viability of alternative locations, he said.
 ''I think the reason Benson will stay in New Orleans, if he does, is that he's got no place to go that's better in the long term,'' Roberts said.
 Relocation would have to be approved by at least 24 of the N.F.L.'s 32 franchise owners. Tagliabue has expressed concern that San Antonio is a smallish market in a state that has two N.F.L. teams. The league has long wanted to place a franchise in Los Angeles, the nation's second-largest television market, which has been without a team for a decade. But there is no stadium there outfitted in the accustomed luxury of the N.F.L. and no great clamoring for a team, especially one as unaccomplished as the Saints.
 Where the team is truly loved, with all of its faults, is New Orleans. Sundays with the Saints are as much a staple here as red beans and rice on Mondays and seafood on Fridays. The loss of the team would tatter the social fabric. 
 ''It would be like taking smoked sausage out of gumbo,'' said Wayne Washington, 34, an Orleans Parish sheriff's deputy.
 There is much hope here that Tagliabue will feel obligated to keep the Saints in New Orleans if it is fiscally reasonable, lest the league appear uncaring in the wake of a disaster.
 ''The commissioner and the league's owners are sensitive to the role of the Saints in Louisiana and the importance of decisions that have to be made,'' Greg Aiello, a league spokesman, said. But, he added, the league and Louisiana faced complex issues that must be resolved before any permanent action could be taken.
 Preliminary estimates are that storm damage to the Superdome will cost $125 million to $200 million to repair. 
 Before Katrina struck, the state had offered the Saints $174 million in renovations, including more luxury suites, widened concourses and more seats in the lower bowl of the stadium. That offer must be revisited.
 A refitted stadium could reopen for football between October 2006 and January 2007, state officials said. 
 Damage from Katrina did not warrant the construction of a new stadium, officials said.
 ''We fully intend on rebuilding the Superdome with some possible enhancements that would be very cost effective in satisfying the Saints,'' said Tim Coulon, chairman of the Louisiana Stadium and Exposition District.
 Yet, even before Katrina, the Saints encountered some political resistance to aiding the team and Benson, particularly from legislators in central and north Louisiana. 
 ''There's no political will I have been able to find to give them anything at this point,'' said State Rep. Rick L. Farrar, a Democrat from Pineville in central Louisiana. Instead of showing the can-do spirit of getting back on their feet, they took off. That shows a tremendous lack of character.''
 In a hopeful and conciliatory gesture, Nagin wore a Saints sweatshirt to a town hall meeting Wednesday. If the Saints truly wanted to return, he said, New Orleans would gladly take them back.
