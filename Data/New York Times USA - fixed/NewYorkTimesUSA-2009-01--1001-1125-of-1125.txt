HEADLINE: Attention, Shopaholics: Your Weakness May Be a Proper Disease

BYLINE: By ALAN FEUER

 BODY:
First there was John A. Thain's $87,000 rug. Then there was Citigroup's planned $50 million corporate jet.
 Then the world of politics got involved this week when the New York State inspector general released a report saying that Antonia C. Novello, the former state commissioner of health, had such an ingrained tendency for shopping that she had employees from her office squire her on buying expeditions to Macy's, Saks Fifth Avenue and three different Albany-area malls.
 Ill-advised shopping has certainly turned up recently in the news, and yet the issue also forms the core of a much more contentious and continuing debate. As spenders spend while the economy plummets, the psychiatric world is trying to decide whether compulsive buying should actually be considered a disease. 
 At least for now, the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders -- which is known as the D.S.M. and is something like the bible of psychological maladies -- does not list the condition as a technical disease. While shopaholism, as the laymen say, has been recognized by the German psychiatric community as a subset of obsessive-compulsive disorder, it still awaits its day in the United States. 
 According to April L. Benson, author of ''I Shop, Therefore I Am: Compulsive Buying and the Search for Self,'' that day is almost certain to arrive. 
 ''At best, shopping is an activity that can promote self-definition, even healing,'' Dr. Benson said in an interview on Tuesday afternoon. ''But like any behavior it can spin out of control. In extreme cases, there's no doubt it's a disorder. It can be as dangerous as drug or alcohol addiction. Suicides have been known to occur because of debt.''
 There has been no suggestion that Ms. Novello or Mr. Thain, who was pushed out after Bank of America took over Merrill Lynch, the brokerage giant he once ran, suffer from any disorder. 
 But the state inspector general wrote that one of Ms. Novello's subordinates said that her ''fondness for shopping was so well known that employees in the office would give her sales fliers or coupons to encourage her to leave the office so that they would not have to work late.'' 
 The report, which also accused Ms. Novello of misusing state employees for other personal chores, was referred to the Albany County district attorney. Ms. Novello's lawyer, E. Stewart Jones, who did not return a phone call Tuesday seeking comment, has said that she did not do anything that calls for criminal prosecution. 
 The literature's first mention of compulsive buying was in the early 1900s by two of Freud's disciples, Eugene Bleuler and Emil Kraepelin, who coined the term oniomania --from the Greek root ''onios,'' which means for sale -- to refer to those obsessed with making purchases. Bleuler wrote of ''buying maniacs'' for whom even the simplest expenditure ''is compulsive and leads to senseless contraction of debts.'' He suggested the condition was akin to kleptomania, describing it as a form of ''impulsive insanity.''
 A leading expert in the field, Dr. Donald W. Black, a professor of psychiatry at the University of Iowa, suggested that compulsive shoppers tended to be women who have had relatives also predisposed to buying binges, and lived in areas overflowing with goods and the disposable income to buy them. He added that medical trials to treat the condition have been stymied by a lack of government funding.
 There are some, however, who wonder whether oniomania should, in fact, be included in the D.S.M., including Dr. Jack Drescher, a Manhattan psychiatrist and former president of the New York County chapter of the American Psychiatric Association. After musing that the condition may not have much of a ''cross-cultural effect'' (''There are no shopaholics in poor countries''), Dr. Drescher said: ''The question is, is there a pure strain of social behavior that leads people to shopping and nothing else?''
 For Ellen Mohr Catalano, an executive coach and former self-help guru, the crucial question was treatment. Ms. Catalano, co-author of ''Consuming Passions: Help for Compulsive Shoppers,'' suggested taking one's addiction in hand then ''placing it away from who you really are.''
 ''You don't tell yourself you can't do it, or can't have it,'' she cautioned. ''You just give yourself some space.''
 As for the economy, it matters, Dr. Benson said. In fat times, compulsive shoppers work with extra fervor to keep up with the Joneses. But in lean times, their guilt is a conflicting brew of shame (widespread unemployment) and temptation (cut-rate sales).
 ''It's like giving matches to a pyromaniac,'' she said.

HEADLINE: Shares Rise as Some Companies Surpass Profit Estimates

BYLINE: By JACK HEALY

 BODY:
Stock markets advanced for another day on Tuesday, making small gains as investors weighed a mixed bag of earnings reports against new evidence that housing prices were falling and consumers were becoming more pessimistic.
 Though the market's rise was modest, analysts said it was a welcome relief after a rough start in 2009. 
 ''We haven't gone down, so basically, gee, that's good,'' said Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst at Standard & Poor's. 
 The major indexes, which dropped more than 30 percent in 2008, have fallen even further in January. 
 ''It's a killer,'' Mr. Silverblatt said. ''This month may be the worst January in history -- we're making a run for it. The layoffs have been amazing, and every group I talk to is paranoid about cash flow.''
 On Monday alone, employers like Caterpillar, Home Depot and Texas Instruments announced a total of more than 75,000 job cuts.
 Beaten-down financial stocks, including Citigroup, Bank of America and JPMorgan Chase, helped lift the Dow Jones industrial average Tuesday. Consumer companies and automakers also bounced back.
 The Dow Jones industrial average gained 58.7 points, or 0.72 percent, to 8,174.73. The broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 9.1 points, or 1.09 percent, to 845.71. The technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index was up 15.44 points, or 1.04 percent, to 1,504.90.
 Crude oil prices fell $4.15 in New York to close at $41.58 a barrel, while Treasury prices increased. The Treasury's 10-year note rose 1 1/32, to 110 18/32. The yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, fell to 2.53 percent, from 2.64 percent late Monday.
 Earnings reports from companies including United States Steel helped drive the rally. Shares of U.S. Steel rose 6.9 percent, to $31.49, after the company's fourth-quarter profit beat estimates. Delta Air Lines, meanwhile, said it lost $1.4 billion in the fourth quarter as it booked a huge charge related to employee stock awards. Its shares fell 20 percent, to $7.93.
 Wall Street's gains came as the economy sent up more distress flares. The Conference Board reported that consumer confidence fell to new lows in January, and the closely watched Case-Shiller 20-city home price index for November slid to its lowest levels since the beginning of 2004.
 The Labor Department also reported that unemployment, which has risen to 7.2 percent nationally, rose in every single state and the District of Columbia in December as more employers slashed jobs. 
 Jobless rates in two states rose to double digits, with Michigan reporting unemployment at 10.6 percent and Rhode Island at 10 percent. Wyoming had the lowest unemployment rate, at 3.4 percent, and North Dakota was second, with 3.5 percent.
 ''The economy's still likely to get worse before it gets better,'' said Russ Koesterich, head of investment strategy at Barclays Global Investors. ''And as we continue to get this torrent of bad economic data, stocks are going to continue to struggle.
 ''Everyone knows that stocks turn before the economy,'' he added, ''but they don't turn years before the economy.''
 Following are the results of Tuesday's Treasury auction of four-week bills and two-year notes:

HEADLINE: Like U.S., Japan Moves to Take Stakes in Ailing Companies

BYLINE: By BETTINA WASSENER

 BODY:
The Japanese government outlined on Tuesday a plan to inject state money into ailing companies in exchange for equity stakes, a move that echoes the partial nationalization of some troubled financial firms in the United States and Europe.
 The announcement, by the trade ministry, is the latest in a string of efforts by the Japanese government to aid companies -- in this case especially small and medium-size businesses -- that are struggling as demand dwindles. 
 In the last few weeks, profit warnings and job losses have streamed steadily from every sector of the economy. Recent statistics showed bankruptcies in Japan jumped 24 percent in December from a year earlier, and 33 listed firms were among the victims last year -- the highest tally in at least 60 years. 
 This has prompted the Japanese government, like those in Europe and the United States, to consider taking stakes in ailing companies, rather than relying on the country's banks to increase lending -- something that beleaguered financial institutions have been reluctant to do since the collapse of Lehman Brothers in September.
 Although Japan's banks were little exposed to the mortgage-related products that forced many of their American and European counterparts into billions of write-downs, the economic downturn and last year's stock market rout have begun to wear on Japanese financial institutions.
 The country's largest brokerage firm, Nomura, reported a $3.8 billion loss in the fourth quarter of 2008 on Tuesday, in large part because of costs related to its acquisition of the Asian, European and Middle East operations of Lehman Brothers.
 Tuesday's plan by the trade ministry, to be considered by the cabinet next month, reaches beyond the banking sector to other parts of the Japanese economy. It foresees the state-owned Development Bank of Japan buying shares in companies that are having trouble raising money amid the lingering credit crisis. The government will guarantee the investments should the companies go bankrupt, the ministry said.
 Although it did not specify what type of companies might be eligible for such help, the plan would probably be aimed mainly at the small and medium-size outfits that employ 70 percent of the country's work force and are crucial suppliers to corporate giants.
 While shrinking domestic and international demand, compounded by a strong yen, is weighing heavily on industry leaders like Sony and Toyota, it is the smaller companies that have found it hardest to obtain bank lending. Their plight has become a highly politicized issue in Japan ahead of elections later this year.
 Japan's recession, and broad dissatisfaction with the way in which the government of Taro Aso, Japan's prime minister, is handling the crisis, has caused Mr. Aso's approval ratings to tumble below 20 percent in recent opinion polls, raising the possibility that the governing Liberal Democratic Party will lose the election.
 Highlighting the political divisions and pre-election positioning, a 4.8 trillion yen, or $53.7 billion, stimulus plan was approved by Parliament on Tuesday, but only after lengthy discussions.
 That plan is part of a series of stimulus measures announced since last summer. They include moves by Japan's central bank to lower interest rates to near zero and to try to shore up ailing Japanese credit markets by buying commercial paper, a type of short-term corporate debt.
 The latest trade ministry proposal helped send the benchmark Nikkei 225 stock market index up nearly 5 percent on Tuesday.
 Economists said it remained unclear, however, how the plan would be put in place, and some cautioned that it should not be used to artificially prop up ailing companies at taxpayers' expense. Others said that the measures would do little to address the fundamental collapse in demand.
 The ministry said that capital would be provided only while the companies were facing difficulty in fund-raising because of market turmoil, and that those that receive help would be required to draw up plans to increase profitability.

HEADLINE: Relief Seen for Jobless and States in Health Care Plan

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
The stimulus bill working its way through Congress is not just a package of spending increases and tax cuts intended to jolt the nation out of recession. For Democrats, it is also a tool for rewriting the social contract with the poor, the uninsured and the unemployed, in ways they have long yearned to do. 
 With little notice and no public hearings, House Democrats would create a temporary new entitlement allowing workers getting unemployment checks to qualify for Medicaid, the health program for low-income people. Spouses and children could also receive benefits, no matter how much money the family had. 
 In addition, the stimulus package would offer a hefty subsidy to help laid-off workers retain the same health plans they had from their former employers. 
 Altogether, the economic recovery bill would speed $127 billion over the next two and a half years to individuals and states for health care alone, a fact that has Republicans fuming that the stimulus package is a back door to universal health coverage.
 ''It's raining money,'' said Representative Michael C. Burgess, Republican of Texas.
 The House plans to vote Wednesday on the $825 billion bill, and the Senate is expected to vote on a similar measure next week.
 As Congress rushes to inject cash into a listless economy, it is setting aside many of the restraints that have checked new domestic spending for more than a decade. The White House said the changes contemplated by Congress would provide coverage for nearly 8.5 million newly uninsured people who had lost their jobs and would protect Medicaid for many more whose eligibility would otherwise be at risk.
 Of the $127 billion cost, the Congressional Budget Office said, $87 billion would be used to increase the federal share of Medicaid, $29 billion would subsidize private insurance and $11 billion would finance Medicaid for unemployed workers who could not otherwise qualify. 
 Most of the aid is billed as temporary. But Republicans fear that states would get hooked on it, just as they might grow accustomed to a big increase in federal aid to education, also included in the bill.
 Democrats said the current economic crisis did not allow time for public hearings on the legislation.
 ''This is as urgent as it gets,'' said Representative Anna G. Eshoo, Democrat of California.
 After the House Ways and Means Committee approved its piece of the economic recovery legislation last Thursday, Representative Pete Stark, Democrat of California, said, ''We accomplished more today than in the last eight years.''
 Congressional Democrats developed the package in close consultation with President Obama. Health care provisions of the bill taking shape in the Senate are broadly similar to those in the House bill, though they may prove less expensive. Obama aides and advisers said the president would insist on health insurance assistance for the unemployed as part of a final bill, which he wants to sign by mid-February.
 The legislation would allow states to provide Medicaid to an entirely new group: those who are receiving unemployment insurance benefits, their spouses and children under 19.
 Medicaid is normally for low-income people, and for decades it has been financed jointly by the federal government and the states, with the federal share averaging 57 percent of costs. 
 The economic stimulus bill prevents states from enforcing a means test, saying, ''No income or resources test shall be applied with respect to any category of individuals'' who become eligible for Medicaid because they are receiving unemployment benefits. The federal government would pay 100 percent of the costs for people enrolled under this option through December 2010.
 Republicans said this proposal would take a big step toward federalizing Medicaid. For their part, Democrats said the changes took a major step toward their goal of coverage for all Americans. 
 At the same time, the legislation would provide a huge measure of fiscal relief to state Medicaid programs, at a time when state revenues are declining and the number of Medicaid recipients is rising because of the recession.
 The federal share of Medicaid spending now ranges from 50 percent in higher-income states like New York and Connecticut to more than 73 percent in poor states like Mississippi and West Virginia. Under the House bill, the federal share would be increased by at least 4.9 percentage points in every state, and by much more in states with large increases in unemployment.
 The bill would also offer a lifeline to workers who have lost health insurance along with their jobs. In theory, such workers and their families can keep their group health benefits for 18 months under a federal law, the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1986, known as Cobra. But laid-off workers are often required to pay 102 percent of the full premium, including the employer's share, so the cost now can be prohibitive.
 Under the bill, the federal government would pay 65 percent of the premiums for a year. That subsidy would almost surely increase the number of laid-off workers choosing to continue coverage.
 Republicans wanted to deny the premium subsidies to people who had annual incomes of more than $100,000 or assets of more than $1 million. They also wanted to prevent people with more than $1 million of family income from taking advantage of the Medicaid option for the unemployed.
 Democrats voted down those proposals in the House Committee on Energy and Commerce.
 Representative Nathan Deal, Republican of Georgia, said ''the poorest of the poor'' had long been subject to income and asset tests when applying for Medicaid. But, Mr. Deal argued, under the new option, a millionaire could get Medicaid benefits, financed entirely by the federal government, without being asked about such matters.
 The committee chairman, Representative Henry A. Waxman, Democrat of California, said, ''It's highly unlikely that you are going to find millionaires who would like to go on Medicaid.''
 Moreover, Mr. Waxman said, the purpose of the new options is to ''streamline the enrollment process'' and speed assistance to people who are unemployed.
 ''It's going to set up an unnecessary barrier if we have any income test,'' Mr. Waxman said, adding that the enforcement of a means test could require ''a whole new bureaucracy.''
 The bill would also create a new option for people 55 or older and for those who have worked for the same employer for 10 years or more. They could retain health benefits under Cobra, at their own expense, until they became eligible for Medicare at 65 or obtained coverage through another job. Under this option, employers said, younger workers could conceivably hold onto their coverage for decades.
 In a joint letter to Congress, the United States Chamber of Commerce, the National Association of Manufacturers and the National Retail Federation opposed this proposal, saying it would drive up costs for workers already covered by employer health plans. 
 ''The people who sign up for unsubsidized coverage under the new option are more likely to have serious medical conditions and therefore to increase the cost of employee health care disproportionately,'' said E. Neil Trautwein, a vice president of the National Retail Federation.
 If states wanted the federal government to pay a larger share of Medicaid, they would have to maintain current eligibility levels and could not adopt more restrictive criteria. But states could reduce benefits or payments to health care providers.
 Representative Christopher S. Murphy, Democrat of Connecticut, said he feared that such cuts would make it more difficult for Medicaid recipients to find doctors in some parts of the country.

HEADLINE: Clinton Sees an Opportunity for Iran to Return to Diplomacy

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton said Tuesday that Iran had a ''clear opportunity'' to engage with the international community, amplifying the conciliatory tone struck a day earlier by President Obama toward Iran and the rest of the Muslim world.
 Sketching out an ambitious diplomatic agenda, Mrs. Clinton also suggested that there could be some form of direct communication between the United States and North Korea. And she said relations with China had been excessively influenced by economic issues during the Bush administration. 
 Mrs. Clinton, in her first remarks to reporters since becoming the nation's chief diplomat, said, ''There is a clear opportunity for the Iranians, as the president expressed in his interview, to demonstrate some willingness to engage meaningfully with the international community.''
 Speaking Monday to an Arabic-language news channel, Al Arabiya, Mr. Obama reiterated his determination that the United States explore ways to engage directly with Iran, even as he said Tehran's suspected pursuit of a nuclear weapon and its support for terrorist groups were destabilizing.
 Less than a week into her job, Mrs. Clinton seemed energized. She traveled to the White House on Monday to help send off the administration's special envoy to the Middle East, George J. Mitchell, and she has racked up a list of calls to nearly 40 foreign leaders or foreign ministers.
 The world, Mrs. Clinton asserted, was yearning for a new American foreign policy. 
 ''There is a great exhalation of breath going on around the world,'' she said. ''We've got a lot of damage to repair.''
 Mrs. Clinton did not disclose the options under consideration for reaching out to Iran, beyond mentioning the existing multilateral talks involving Britain, France, Germany, Russia and China. But she indicated that she and Mr. Obama were thinking broadly.
 The multilateral group is scheduled to meet next week in Germany, and European diplomats said they hoped that the meeting would provide the first clues about the administration's strategy.
 The administration is expected to name Dennis B. Ross, a longtime Middle East peace negotiator, to a senior post handling Iran, according to State Department officials. That Mr. Ross was not at the same meeting as Mr. Mitchell surprised some people who follow Iranian issues, given how long his appointment had been rumored. But officials said Mr. Ross was at the State Department on Monday.
 Analysts said the timing for an American overture to Iran was better now than it had been for a long time.
 ''The Iranian regime is in a truly desperate situation,'' said Abbas Milani, the director of Iranian studies at Stanford University. ''The regime is in a much more amenable mood because the economy is in a shambles. They're also dealing with someone whose name is Barack Hussein Obama.''
 As for North Korea, Mrs. Clinton said the administration was committed to existing multilateral talks over its nuclear program. But she noted that in the past, there had been bilateral talks within the current six-nation arrangement. ''We're going to pursue steps that we think are effective,'' she said.
 On China, Mrs. Clinton said that the United States needed ''a more comprehensive approach'' and that the strategic dialogue of the Bush administration ''turned into an economic dialogue.'' 
 ''The economy will always be a centerpiece of our relationship, but we want it to be part of a broader agenda,'' Mrs. Clinton said. She did not specify what other issues the United States would put on the table. 
 Last week, Timothy F. Geithner, who was sworn in Monday as Treasury secretary, signaled a potentially more confrontational stance toward China, saying in written testimony to the Senate that China manipulated its currency.
 During the Bush administration, the Treasury Department, particularly under Henry M. Paulson Jr., played a lead role in coordinating policy toward China. Mrs. Clinton has pushed for the State Department to increase its profile on economic affairs, which suggests a stronger role on China.
 Mrs. Clinton declined to be drawn out on details about changes in policy toward Iran or another thorny challenge, Afghanistan. Both, she said, were the subject of policy reviews. 
 She also said little about Mr. Mitchell's first mission, except to note that the United States was focused for now on talks between the Israelis and the Palestinians. She did not address Syria's role.
 Mrs. Clinton brushed off suggestions that the appointment of Mr. Mitchell and another emissary -- Richard C. Holbrooke, who will be special representative for Afghanistan and Pakistan -- could lead to conflict or rivalries in policy making.
 ''Oh, no, no,'' she said. ''I think we have already established a collegial, effective working relationship.''

HEADLINE: Britain Offers $3.2 Billion In Aid to Its Carmakers

BYLINE: By JULIA WERDIGIER

DATELINE: LONDON 

 BODY:
Britain joined other governments bailing out their auto industries by announcing a $3.2 billion aid package on Tuesday, after three months of pleas from unions and executives of Jaguar Land Rover and Vauxhall, a General Motors brand. 
 The government offered automakers and suppliers access to $:1.3 billion ($1.8 billion) in loan guarantees from the European Investment Bank, topped off with another $:1 billion from the Treasury, the business secretary, Peter Mandelson, told Parliament on Tuesday. He said the government would also increase the amount that it spent on the training of employees.
 The automotive industry ''is in the front line of the downturn, with output falling faster and further than any other sector since the summer,'' Mr. Mandelson said. ''We need to counter this to prevent an irreversible loss of capacity, skills and technology.''
 But he added that the ''industry is not a lame duck and this is no bailout.'' 
 ''There is no blank check on offer, no operating subsidies,'' Mr. Mandelson said.
 The opposition Conservative Party criticized the measures are ''too little, too late'' and accused the government of dithering while other nations moved swiftly to support their automakers. The plan came a month after the United States pumped billions of dollars into General Motors and Chrysler, and France and Germany announced aid packages to support their automakers.
 Any aid to auto manufacturers in Britain is potentially more controversial than in those other countries. Though the industry adds about $:10 billion to Britain's economy and employs more than 800,000, most of the British manufacturers are owned by foreign companies. 
 Britain's government initially hesitated to help the auto industry, saying that it needed to protect taxpayers' money and that the company owners should be responsible for supporting the automakers. Jaguar Land Rover, which employs 15,000 in Britain, is owned by Tata Motor of India, which has pressed for aid since November, saying the situation was a ''national emergency requiring urgent action.''
 Pressure to help the industry, which exports about 76 percent of its cars, mounted when production almost halved in December, work was halted at some plants and the industry's difficulties started to affect other areas. Corus, one of Europe's largest steel makers, said Monday that it would cut 2,500 jobs in Britain after demand from automakers and the construction industry fell sharply.
 Britain's government is already worried about unemployment, which rose for an 11th month in December when it reached 1.16 million, the highest since January 2000.
 Howard Wheeldon, a senior strategist at BGC Partners in London, said he doubted that the package would be enough to rescue the industry in the long term but that ''it should see those that take it up through the rest of this year.'' 
 Mr. Mandelson said the support was intended to help make Britain's economy ''more balanced'' -- the current recession has shown that it is too reliant on the financial services industry. 
 The support should also make the auto industry ''greener, more innovative and more productive,'' Mr. Mandelson said. He did not say whether the aid was linked to specific conditions.
 Mr. Mandelson was expected to meet executives from Vauxhall and Jaguar Land Rover on Wednesday.

HEADLINE: The Greenhouse Effect and the Bathtub Effect

BYLINE: ANDREW C. REVKIN


HIGHLIGHT: When is the atmosphere like a bathtub? Now. 

 BODY:
A new paper in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, concluding that the buildup of human-generated greenhouse gases could leave a profound millenniums-long imprint on climate and sea levels, focuses on a characteristic of global warming that the public, and many policymakers, have not absorbed -- at least according to John Sterman at M.I.T.
That characteristic is the "bathtub effect" behind the human-amplified greenhouse effect. Dr. Sterman, a prominent analyst of risk perception and management at the Sloan School, has devised various tools akin to flight simulators to help corporate leaders understand the nature of a variety of problems and choose among various remedies. He recently turned this approach to climate, which he says bears much more resemblance to deficit spending and the national debt than it does to 20th-century-style pollution problems like acid rain.
Basically, the atmosphere is like a bathtub with a partially opened drain. Carbon dioxide from burning fuels and forests is flowing in twice as fast as it is being absorbed by plants and the ocean, and some of those "sinks" are in fact getting saturated, it appears, meaning that the "drain" is clogging a bit. (More on "CO2's Long Goodbye".) [UPDATE, 1/29: Inspired by this piece, Marc Roberts, perhaps the world's best -- and only -- climate cartoonist, reposted a hilarious take on the bathbub effect.]
In a tub, this is a recipe for a flood. In the climate system, Dr. Sterman says -- echoing many climate scientists -- it is a loud message that a prompt start is needed in curbing and then cutting emissions if you want to cut the chances of passing dangerous thresholds. He recently wrote a Policy Forum paper in Science reviewing his and other research on widespread misunderstanding of this kind of risk, including a 2007 study he was a co-author of in which 84 percent of 212 M.I.T. participating grad students drew curves for proposed emission trends that would result in concentrations continuing to climb.
"The erroneous belief that stabilizing emissions would quickly stabilize the climate supports wait-and-see policies but violates basic laws of physics," Dr. Sterman concluded.
I sent him the study from the Proceedings, which was led by Susan Solomon, who also led a five-year review of science that culminated in the main report in 2007 by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. His response is worth reading, and is included below. 
Dr. Sterman and other social scientists assessing climate science and climate policy say that a vital task for President Obama and his climate-energy team (and for scientists and the media), even as they weigh legislation and a treaty and technology, is to educate the public on the bathtub effect.
Without greater understanding of the nature of the problem, he says, it will be hard to convince the public of the need for big, prompt, costly changes to the energy system, even when the worst impacts are projected to come later in the century.
The long lifetime of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, and the long lifetime of sources like coal-burning power plants once built, mean that the "faucet" for CO2 is getting cranked open just when it should be going in the opposite direction. Across Cambridge at Harvard, Kimberly Thompson holds the same view.
In a recent email, she said anyone thinking effective policy can be crafted only by society's elite is engaged in wishful thinking.
I don't believe that experts alone can solve the climate change issue," she said in an email. "I'm with Thomas Jefferson, who said: "I know no safe depository of the ultimate powers of the society but the people themselves; and if we think them not enlightened enough to exercise their control with a wholesome discretion, the remedy is not to take it from them, but to inform their discretion by education...." Bottom line from my perspective - we need education that helps correct people's mental models....
You can try an exercise Dr. Sterman created on the greenhouse bathtub problem online. He wrote a fascinating piece for the journal Science on the results of a study testing hundreds of very smart M.I.T. students to see if they could draw an emissions curve that would stop the level of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere from rising.
To those eager for more, here's Dr. Sterman's reaction to the Solomon et al paper:
I have read the Solomon paper.
It's an excellent demonstration of the bathtub principle -- the concept of stocks and flows, which prior research shows many people, even many highly educated people, don't understand. Our mental models suggest that if we stop the growth of emissions, we will stop global warming, and if we cut emissions, we'll quickly return to a cooler climate. We tend to think that the output of a process should be correlated with -- look like -- its input. If greenhouse gas emissions are growing, we think, the climate will warm, and if we cut emissions, we imagine that the climate will cool. In systems with significant accumulations, however, such correlational reasoning does not hold. Rather, it's more like filling a bathtub. The amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is like the level of water in a bathtub. The level grows as long as you pour more water in through the faucet than drains out. Right now, we pour about twice as much CO2 into the atmospheric tub than is removed on net by natural processes.
Stabilizing atmospheric concentrations requires emissions to fall to the net removal rate. Further, because of the processes highlighted in the Solomon paper and other analyses, including the IPCC AR4, the net removal of CO2 from the atmosphere is likely to fall as the stocks that absorb all that carbon, particularly the oceans, fill up. There are other key "bathtubs" -- accumulations -- that contribute to the irreversibility of climate change Solomon highlights. First, global mean surface temperature depends on the quantity of heat stored at the surface of the earth (earth, lower atmosphere, and the mixed layer of the oceans). That stock of heat is increased by net radiative forcing, the difference between the flow of energy coming in (primarily from the sun) less the flow of energy radiated back to space and the flow of heat transfered to the deep ocean. Today that inflow exceeds the outflow, so the average temperature is rising. Stabilizing the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere may stop the growth in net radiative forcing, but will not reduce the net inflow of energy (net radiative forcing) to zero. So temperatures will continue to rise until the planet warms enough to restore radiative balance. Solomon's paper points out that the heat currently absorbed by the oceans does not disappear, but eventually returns to warm the surface. Thus temperatures won't fall quickly even if atmospheric GHGs peak and eventually drop. And so on. Land-based ice in glaciers and ice-sheets will keep contributing to sea level rise as long as melting exceeds snowfall accumulation; stopping the growth of temperature would not stop the net melting.
What all this means is that the rate at which the climate returns to "normal" -- say, early 20th century conditions -- is so slow that, for key factors like sea level, precipitation patterns, ice sheets, and so on, the flow out of the bathtub is very very slow. So climate is a bit like the national debt. The US federal deficit has exploded in recent years, and the national debt has exploded as well. But suppose we could instantly cut the deficit to zero -- drop it from about a trillion dollars per year to zero. What would happen to the debt? Of course it would not fall, but would instead stop growing at its all time peak value. Because the drains out of the various bathtubs involved in the climate -- atmospheric concentrations, the heat balance of the surface and oceans, ice sheet accumulations, and thermal expansion of the oceans -- are small and slow, the emissions we generate in the next few decades will lead to changes that, on any time scale we can contemplate, are irreversible.
One more critical point: it's important that people not react to Solomon's work with despair. Yes, a certain amount of climate change, due to past emissions, is inevitable, and will not be reversible. But it would be tragic if people concluded that therefore there is nothing we can do, that it is futile to reduce emissions, and that therefore all efforts should shift to adaptation. To the contrary: if nothing is done to cut emissions, and soon, the climate our children and grandchildren will face will almost certainly be far less hospitable, and there will be no turning back. By the time we know for certain how bad it will be it will be too late to take any corrective action. The Solomon paper should finally bury the idea that we can wait and see. It further strengthens the case for immediate, strong mitigation. The good news is that it's getting cheaper every day to cut carbon emissions. Through learning, scale economies, R&D, and other forms of innovation, new technologies for carbon-neutral renewable energy are becoming more available and less expensive. Each megawatt of solar or wind capacity we build lowers the cost of the next and the next -- a positive feedback we need to strengthen if we are to avoid irreversible harm to the ability of the planet to sustain us.

HEADLINE: For Some, It's About More Than Surviving Hard Times

BYLINE: By PETER APPLEBOME. 
E-mail: peappl@nytimes.com

DATELINE: POUGHKEEPSIE, N.Y. 

 BODY:
 Like many social services agencies, the Poughkeepsie YMCA, which celebrated its 145th year of operation in 2008, has patched and filled for years, particularly in maintaining its 40-year-old, 6,100-square-foot building downtown.
 And then the point came when it no longer could. Energy prices got out of control. Revenues plunged when families could no longer afford summer camp. Then came the economic collapse. 
 ''That was the nail in the coffin for us,'' said Elaine Trumpetto, chief volunteer officer and board chairwoman. ''You can squeeze by, little by little, having special events, getting by, but the economy just doesn't allow us to do that anymore.''
 On Jan. 12, the Y sent out a letter telling its 2,000 members that it could no longer afford its building and was closing it. Officials scrambled to try to offer some of its child care, after-school and recreation services at satellite sites. Most of the staff was laid off. Those who remain will try to reinvent the organization in a smaller form.
 So Ms. Trumpetto was intrigued but somehow not surprised on Tuesday night when 350 officials from 170 different Hudson Valley nonprofit organizations took up every available parking spot at a local reception hall and filled a large banquet room on the Hudson, ice floes drifting by outside like frigid parade floats. 
 In truth, but for the scenery, you could have replicated this gathering, with its topic, Managing Nonprofit Organizations in Lean Times, anywhere in the country. You didn't need to know the organizations -- Mid-Hudson Addiction Recovery Centers, Miles of Hope Breast Cancer Foundation, Rural and Migrant Ministry, Mid Hudson Animal Aid, Semper Fi Parents of the Hudson Valley, Food Bank of the Hudson Valley, Harriet Tubman Academic Skills Program -- to know what they were about.
 But a sympathetic local foundation, the Dyson Foundation, decided to hold the session here. And it provided another glimpse of the endless tendrils of the unfolding financial disaster and the particular vulnerabilities of those who might have thought they were operating far, far from the gilded world of the geniuses on Wall Street. 
 ''I've been to other events, but I never saw a turnout like this before,'' Ms. Trumpetto said. ''That tells you something. People have never weathered a storm like this before.''
 Of course, the nonprofit world is hardly a monolith. The Hudson River Rowing Association or the Old Rhinebeck Aerodrome (antique airplane museum and air show) don't have much in common with Hudson Valley Mental Health or the Reach Out Food Pantry. The Reach Center in Hudson, a small organization serving crime victims and their families, may have a harder time surviving than Vassar College or the Culinary Institute of America.
 Still, you didn't have to look hard for signs of just how tough things are, beginning with the host, the Dyson Foundation, which donates to nonprofits in Poughkeepsie and the surrounding area. At the end of 2007, it had $353 million in its endowment. That's down to about $235 million now. The foundation says it plans to offer about the same level of grants this year as last year -- approximately $16.5 million -- but will restrict most of it to supporting safety-net programs that provide food, housing, access to basic heath care and emergency assistance to low-income families.
 AND, short of those who had taken on capital campaigns or building projects at the wrong time, the people who seemed the most stressed were the ones with jobs that were difficult enough before the financial crisis -- catering to those at the bottom of the anthill.
 Joseph D'Ambrosio is president of the Family Partnership Center, which tried to get ahead of the fiscal crunch and create some kind of synergy by locating 26 health and human services agencies together under one roof in what used to be the old Poughkeepsie High School in a struggling part of town.
 He ran through the factors that made the challenges particularly daunting even before the economy soured: the dismantling of much of the traditional federal aid network during the Clinton years, the scandals that hurt United Way funding, the erosion of jobs. ''We're all struggling to survive, really,'' he said. ''It's not like people were comfortable before this started.''
 Still, there are worse things than doing what you're passionate about and making a difference in the world, which, along with the wondrous view outside the window, made the gathering about more than just surviving hard times. The session's speaker was Clara Miller, president and chief executive of the Nonprofit Finance Fund, which provides loans and grants to nonprofits. She was appropriately solemn and cautionary. And then, in a way, she wasn't.
 ''We're in the social sector, and what we need to be focused on like a laser is the public we serve,'' she said. ''The kid who will be abused if he doesn't get help. People who might be hungry. It's generations who will not learn, or see a play. It's all those things. Environments that will be preserved, beautiful buildings. All those fabulous and diverse missions that we dedicate ourselves to. That is the unifying voice for all of us in these times.''

HEADLINE: An East Village Market Where Everything Is Free Faces an Uncertain Future

BYLINE: By COLIN MOYNIHAN

 BODY:
There were heaps of clothes inside the church hall, including wool sweaters and what looked like a pair of lederhosen that somebody might have once worn in the Alps. There were children's toys and a box of designer sunglasses. 
 A table held books, including ''Fortress America,'' by William Greider, about the American military after the cold war; and ''The Family,'' in which the author, Ed Sanders, a member of the rock band the Fugs, tells the strange, violent story of Charles Manson and his acolytes. 
 For more than four years, people have stopped by St. Mark's Church in-the-Bowery, on East 10th Street in the East Village, for a monthly gathering known as the Really Really Free Market. The concept owes a debt to both modern Dumpster divers and to the Diggers, a 17th-century English group dedicated to economic equality. People bring things to the market they no longer want but may be useful to others. At the same time, they help themselves to other people's discards. No money changes hands.
 So on Sunday night, Rob Freeman, a 33-year-old anthropologist from Greenpoint, Brooklyn, dropped off Matchbox cars his son had outgrown. K. Olive McKeon, a 22-year-old student, offered a photocopied zine called ''Yoga as Political Praxis'' bound with bits of blue ribbon. And a first-time visitor, Rebecca Jablonsky, 27, from Williamsburg, Brooklyn, picked up Mr. Greider's book and a few other things to read, including ''The Autobiography of Malcolm X.''
 ''It's like a thrift store but everyone contributes,'' she said, surveying a crowd of more than 100 people in the room. ''And nobody's fighting over anything.''
 Organizers said the Really Really Free Market has never seemed more relevant than in the current economic climate. But now the future of the market, at least at St. Mark's, is in doubt. Elizabeth Arce, 20, a member of In Our Hearts, the network of collectives and individuals that runs the market, said that a church staff member told her this month that the market would have to move.
 ''He said the Really Really Free Market could not be held at the church anymore,'' she said.
 Ms. Arce said that if she and others could not reach an agreement with the church, they would begin looking for another site for the next gathering, scheduled for the end of February.
 James Benn, the church administrator, said the free market would not be permanently banned but merely suspended, while the church awaited the appointment of a new priest. 
 ''We told them they are not ousted,'' he said. ''Right now, we need to take a break.''
 At first glance the market might seem to be a good fit with the church, which has a long history of being involved with the neighborhood culture, some of it radical or avant-garde. St. Mark's, a historic Federal-style Episcopal church, is home to several groups, including the Ontological-Hysteric Theater, led by Richard Foreman and the Poetry Project, whose participants have included Allen Ginsberg, Robert Lowell, Kenneth Koch and John Ashbery.
 The first Really Really Free Markets came out of antiglobalization demonstrations during a Free Trade of the Americas Agreement summit, held in 2003 in Miami, and the 2004 assembly of the Group of 8 held on Sea Isle in Georgia. Since then, markets have been put on in cities like San Francisco, Minneapolis and Cincinnati, inspired by the desire to recycle while questioning capitalist economic models. 
 The New York market started at St. Mark's in August 2004 and was organized as an annual or semiannual gathering until September, when it became a monthly event. 
 Organizers said the free market was meant to be a continuation of the Free Store, which volunteers from In Our Hearts operated for several years on Grand Street in Williamsburg.
 One of those volunteers, Thadeaus Davidson, 28, from Bedford-Stuyvesant, said he thought the market fostered a sense of community.
 ''There's no stress or financial pressure,'' he said. ''There's a healthy spirit of mutual aid.''
 On Sunday, Mr. Davidson stood near the entrance to the room behind a table loaded with pamphlets and zines like ''D.I.Y. How to Quit Smoking'' and ''Insurrectionary Anarchy.'' Another table held slightly more mainstream periodicals, like Boycott Quarterly, formerly published in Olympia, Wash., and Granta, an English literary magazine. 
 The crowd milled through the room as a piano, guitar and harmonica ensemble belted out a foot-stomping folk tune. To avoid confusion, some people had affixed notes to property they did not intend to relinquish. A black rucksack, for instance, leaned against the wall with a safety-pinned piece of paper reading, ''Please Do Not Take.''
 A man sitting in a chair received a free haircut. Another man held aloft a hand-lettered cardboard sign that read ''Free Advice.'' Nearby, Ms. McKeon, the creator of the yoga zine, stretched out on a foam mat and prepared to give a few free lessons.
 ''I teach professionally,'' she said. ''But I have more fun here because it feels more like a gift than a job.''

HEADLINE: Skepticism About Plan To Shutter Power Plant

BYLINE: By KEN BELSON

 BODY:
Assemblyman Michael N. Gianaris sent a letter this week accusing the New York Power Authority of trying to keep one of the city's dirtiest power plants open beyond the January 2010 deadline for shutting it. 
 The power authority -- which provides electricity to city agencies, the Port Authority and other large users -- denied the accusation and said it would abide by the 2003 agreement to shutter the 885-megawatt Charles Poletti power plant in Astoria, Queens.
 But Mr. Gianaris's letter, sent on Monday to the authority's president, Richard M. Kessel, threatens to renew tension between the power company and environmental groups that have for years been fighting over pollution in northwestern Queens, home to the largest concentration of power plants in the city.
 To make up for the loss of the Poletti plant, the authority opened a 500-megawatt plant next door in 2005. It is also working with a company that has proposed building a cable under the Hudson River to transport electricity from plants in New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Maryland, where energy prices are generally lower. And the agency signed a deal with Astoria Energy L.L.C., which is supposed to provide power from a new plant it is building in Queens.
 But Mr. Gianaris, who represents northwestern Queens, said that the two projects might never get built because of technical complications, cost overruns and tight credit. He argued that the authority had long known of these problems and might use them as excuses to keep the Poletti plant open longer.
 ''Whether the awarding of these contracts was the result of ineptitude or deliberate malfeasance to force an electricity generation crisis, it has given rise to concerns that NYPA will attempt to either keep Poletti operating, or attempt to construct yet another generating facility in western Queens to compensate for the fact that the two contracts referenced above will yield no additional electricity,'' the letter said.
 Mr. Kessel said in an interview that the Poletti plant would be closed on schedule. He acknowledged that the cross-Hudson cable and the Astoria Energy plant were still more than a year away from completion, but said that alternative sources of electricity were available in the meantime -- and that the slowing economy had reduced electricity demand to ease the urgency for the new projects. 
 ''We're comfortable with whatever gap exists between the closing of Poletti and one or both of the projects, especially when you factor in the governor's goal for increasing energy efficiency,'' Mr. Kessel said. ''We're intent on going forward with these projects.''
 Mr. Gianaris, for his part, pointed out that authority officials had said at board meetings that the trans-Hudson cable was about 10 times over budget, and that Con Edison officials have raised technical problems regarding the connection of Astoria Energy's plant to the grid.
 The assemblyman also said that the former president of the power authority, Roger B. Kelley, told industry officials in 2007 that the power authority was considering building another power plant in Astoria if its two options for replacing the electricity from the old Poletti plant fell through.
 He, and some of his allies in the community, vowed legal action if the Poletti plant was kept open beyond next January.

HEADLINE: Fed Signals It's Ready to Expand Assistance as Needed

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS; Jack Healy contributed reporting.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Conceding that the economy is still spiraling downward on most fronts, the Federal Reserve signaled on Wednesday that it would expand its use of unconventional measures to directly prop up lending for mortgages, consumer loans and businesses.
 ''The Federal Reserve will employ all available tools to promote the resumption of sustainable economic growth and to preserve price stability,'' the Fed said Wednesday in its statement.
 The Fed has already been buying mortgage-backed securities and said in its statement that it would expand its intervention as needed. The committee also served notice that it would purchase longer-term Treasury bonds, a move that would drive down long-term interest rates of all types. 
 And it expressed its most pointed concern so far that deflation could be a problem, saying it saw ''some risk'' that price inflation remained uncomfortably low. 
 One month after the central bank took the historic step of lowering its benchmark interest rate virtually to zero, policy makers pledged on Wednesday to keep it there ''for some time'' and to use ''all available tools'' for reviving the economy in other ways.
 Robert Gay, managing partner at Fenwick Advisers, said he was encouraged by the Fed's hint that it would be willing to increase or extend its program to purchase mortgage-backed securities. 
 ''That's a very positive sign,'' Mr. Gay said. ''The Fed has become Bank USA. It is buying good but illiquid assets and taking them off balance sheets because (banks) can't sell them in the open market.''
 The two-day meeting came as House Democrats prepared to vote on an $825 billion, two-year stimulus passage that included temporary tax cuts and money for roads and bridges, renewable energy programs, health care and more than $150 billion for education programs that range from Head Start for small children to Pell Grants for college students. 
 The Treasury Department, meanwhile, is mapping out a strategy for using the second $350 billion that Congress recently freed up for the Troubled Asset Relief Program, or TARP, that was aimed at infusing fresh capital into the banking system.
 Analysts estimated that the economy contracted by more than 5 percent in the fourth quarter, one of the sharpest quarterly drops in decades. Employers eliminated two million jobs from September through December.
 In their statement, policy makers said that the economy remained weak and would gradually recover later in the year. 
 ''Industrial production, housing starts and employment have continued to decline steeply, as consumers and businesses have cut back spending,'' the Fed statement said. ''Furthermore, global demand appears to be slowing significantly.''
 But it noted that conditions in some financial markets had improved, in part reflecting government bailout efforts. ''Nevertheless, credit conditions for households and firms remain extremely tight,'' the statement said.
 ''This is a view looking a little more darkly through the lens,'' said Stuart Hoffman, chief economist at PNC Financial. ''It looks like the committee is looking at the data for the last six weeks and saying, 'Well, it looks like things are even worse than we thought.' ''
 Because the Fed cannot reduce its overnight lending rate below zero, officials have created an array of specialized new programs aimed at pouring money into particular segments of the credit markets. 
 In the next several weeks, the Fed expects to start a $200 billion program that would finance securities backed by consumer loans, including car loans and credit card debt. Earlier this month, the Fed started a program to buy up $500 billion in mortgage-backed securities. 
 Since September, the central bank has used its authority to create more than $1 trillion out of thin air, more than doubling the size of its balance sheet from about $900 billion in September to just over $2 trillion as of last week.
 But Fed officials have acknowledged for weeks that the economy contracted sharply in the fourth quarter. Employers, who had been shedding about 80,000 jobs a month from January through August, eliminated an average of 500,000 jobs a month from September through December.
 Traditionally, the Fed has tried to steer the overall economy almost entirely through the federal funds rate, the rate that banks charge each other for lending their overnight reserves to each other. But because banks remained highly reluctant to lend, even after the Fed lowered the overnight interest rate time after time, the central bank began creating new programs last fall in which it stepped in as a lender itself. 
 Last month, the central bank lowered the funds rate as far as it could, to a tight range between zero and a quarter of a percent. Since the Fed cannot push the rate below zero, it has been relying more intensively on its various new programs as a tool for pumping money straight into the economy. 
 To push down interest rates on mortgages, the central bank began a program earlier this month to buy $500 billion in mortgage-backed securities issued by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and the federal agencies. Buying large volumes of a security pushes up its price in the market, which leads to lower yields or interest rates. 
 Thus far, the Fed has bought about $53 billion of the securities. But rates for the kind of traditional mortgages that Fannie and Freddie guarantee dropped sharply and stayed low as soon as the Fed announced plans for the program in late November. 
 Wednesday's policy vote was not unanimous. Jeffrey M. Lacker, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, voted against the decision. Mr. Lacker, the statement said, preferred to expand the monetary base by purchasing Treasury securities rather than through targeted credit programs.

HEADLINE: Promising Fans In Seats a View From the Couch

BYLINE: By JOHN BRANCH

DATELINE: TAMPA, Fla. 

 BODY:
Bob Hirsch and Mark Wolchock have watched Giants football games on television together for decades. Increasingly, their view is clearer than that of friends with season tickets. Invariably, the telephone rings. 
 ''Guys will call up from Giants Stadium, asking what happened,'' said Mr. Hirsch, a 56-year-old from New City, N.Y. ''Because they know we saw the play from 15 different angles.''
 It is not lost on league officials, industry executives and entrepreneurs that the best seat in the house may be in the living room, not at the game, even for events like the Super Bowl here on Sunday. Technological advances, ranging from high-definition flat-screen televisions to laptop computers, have provided fans on the couch with information that those in the stands never have.
 That has forced sports officials to rethink the game experience and desperately attempt to bring the living room to the game, not the other way around. 
 The Dallas Cowboys' new stadium will feature a 160-by-71-foot high-definition screen spanning more than half the field. The Jets' and Giants' new stadium, scheduled to open in 2010, will have gigantic video screens in each corner, 20 video boards outside the stadium aimed at tailgaters, and 2,100 high-definition flat-screen televisions inside. 
 Companies like Kangaroo Media and WiseDV are fervently marketing hand-held devices, available at events like Nascar and Formula One races, and tennis and golf tournaments. The units provide various camera feeds, updates and statistics, allowing fans to essentially create a broadcast of the event that they are also watching live.
 Arenas and stadiums everywhere are adding bandwidth capacity and wireless Internet to appease the ever-growing number of high-tech gadgets that fans carry. 
 ''As a society, we have become so conditioned to having access to a virtually limitless amount of information that our expectations have changed,'' said Tim Herbert, senior director for market research for the Consumer Electronics Association. ''For many, it's enough to sit and watch a game. But for many others, especially younger fans, they're looking to have a different type of interaction.''
 Every year, more fans watch sports on giant televisions, pause or rewind the live action themselves, flip through a dozen or more other games available on different channels, and have a laptop nearby to check everything from biographical data to up-to-the-minute fantasy-league statistics, or maybe join a fan forum for running commentary on the proceedings.
 ''People do view the home experience significantly better now than they did, say, 10 years ago,'' Mr. Herbert said.
 When those people go to a game -- if they go to a game -- they are forced to leave many of those capabilities behind. The issue facing the sports industry is just how much that matters.
 Already, half of sports fans believe that watching in high definition is ''almost as good'' as watching in person, according to a survey conducted last January by the C.E.A. and the Sports Video Group. The survey also found that 30 percent planned to watch last year's Super Bowl with a computer nearby, to look up information during the game. 
 Still, officials from the N.F.L., the N.B.A. and Major League Baseball said that they do not view the allure of home viewing as a threat to attracting ticket buyers, even in a battered economy. A live event is unique, they said, and nothing can replace its sights, sounds and smells -- or the ''tribal enthusiasm,'' as the N.F.L. executive vice president Eric Grubman put it, of like-minded people who believe that they can have an impact on the contest's result. 
 ''Football is the ultimate television sport,'' Mr. Grubman said. ''I would also submit that it's the ultimate in-stadium sport.''
 Bob Bowman, chief executive of MLB.com, Major League Baseball's official Web site, said: ''I don't think anything is going to replace the value and sheer pageantry of a live event. That said, it's incumbent on all of us to provide content to enhance the experience for the fan, regardless of where they are.''
 Ticket buyers have always gambled on unpredictable elements ranging from weather to the personalities of fans around them. They have also known that if replays are shown in the stadium, they are usually not repeated from various angles. There are no announcers to explain what has happened. The down time between plays and during commercial breaks can be yawn-inducing. And at sporting events spread over large areas, like golf tournaments and car races, most fans miss the key moments. They are left to catch the highlights later -- at home, probably. 
 But if executives truly did not worry about fans choosing to stay home, there probably would not be such extravagant plans for the latest and biggest video screens at N.F.L. stadiums. 
 Without a nudge from tech-savvy fans, Major League Baseball probably would not promote its ''MLB At Bat'' application for users of iPhones and new-generation BlackBerrys, which might be the next generation's transistor radios. For a price (less than $10 for this season, Mr. Bowman said), users get live scoreboards and box scores, pitch-by-pitch graphics, live radio play-by-plays and near-instant replays.
 Without a nod to the future, the N.B.A. would not continue its foray into three-dimensional broadcasts, widely seen as the next big trend in home viewing. The league first offered a 3-D game to fans in a Cleveland arena during the 2007 finals. About 160 theaters in 35 states will host 3-D broadcasts of next month's All-Star Game.
 And without the technical gadgets at home, people might not find a need for the gadgets from the likes of Kangaroo Media and WiseDV.
 ''People have more and more stuff at home, which, in a way, brings them closer to the game,'' said Martin Greenwood, WiseDV's senior vice president for business development and operations. ''And the question is, if you're already at the game, can we bring you even closer to it?''
 Robert Mimeault, president and chief operating officer of Kangaroo Media, said that his company typically rents out about 10,000 devices at Nascar's Daytona 500, at more than $50 each.
 At the Super Bowl 11 years ago, the backs of some seats featured Vyvx ChoiceSeat touch-screen displays -- ''the granddaddy of all of us,'' said Tim Hayden, who started a company called Vivid Sky to connect fans at events to the type of information they expect at home.
 But at Sunday's Super Bowl in Tampa, Fla., there will be no special technological gizmos beyond the ones people bring themselves. There will be just a game, a halftime show and the typical eye candy to get fans through the commercial breaks. 
 At last year's Super Bowl, Ken Kerschbaumer, editorial director of the Sports Video Group, was struck by how disconnected ticket holders were from the pre-game buzz, when millions at home watched television and scanned the Internet.
 ''You go through the turnstiles, and all of a sudden you don't have the pregame coverage,'' Mr. Kerschbaumer said. ''You just go in and sit there.''
 Eventually, technology at home and at the sports sites might be nearly the same, so fans in both places have similar access to views and information. 
 ''And then it gets back to the old-fashioned stuff,'' said Mr. Bowman, the MLB.com executive. ''Do you want to be able to smell the grass, or do you want to be closer to your refrigerator?''

HEADLINE: American Dream, in Dance and Life

BYLINE: By ALASTAIR MACAULAY

 BODY:
 Making Books Sing is now in its 13th season. For those who -- like me -- had not heard of this project, it takes children's books that tell stories of some social significance and adapts them into hourlong musicals for schoolchildren. (Mainly an operation within New York City, it will visit California for the first time next month.) 
 The purpose is multifocal. The children come, with some prior knowledge of the book, in groups with their teachers and they return to school with, it's hoped, new ideas about creating theater of their own, ideas that are then fostered. Meanwhile they've spent time thinking about -- depending on which year they went -- how it was for Jews and Gentiles growing up in Nazi-occupied France (''The Butterfly'') or Vivaldi's charitable work at the Ospedale della Pieta in Venice (''The Orphan Singer'') or a girl in 17th-century China who learned kung fu from a Shaolin nun (''Beautiful Warrior''). 
 The current Making Books Sing subject is the choreographer Jose Limon, the centenary of whose birth occurred last year and whose story prompted Susanna Reich to write the 2005 children's book ''Jose! Born to Dance'' (Simon & Shuster). In the middle of the 20th century Limon was a leading creator of American modern dance: his work was always well built, serious, often earnest. So doesn't a Limon musical sound like a contradiction in terms? The prospect of watching so surprising a project amid schoolchildren in the Bronx seemed too curious to miss. 
 I loved Tuesday morning's audience; these second to fifth graders could hardly have behaved better. They clapped to every song; they clapped along with every strong rhythm they could find and a few subtle ones; they cheered at the end; and in between they sat wonderfully still and quiet. 
 This musical's main achievement (also drawing on Limon's unfinished memoir) is in telling the story of how a young Mexican became a committed and successful American artist. It's a great American story: in what other nation has the conjunction of immigration and success so often acquired mythic status? And I can imagine no better audience among which to watch it than these largely Hispanic children. When the actor playing Limon (Diego Rodriguez) asked how many of them were immigrants or the children of immigrants, most hands shot up in the air. A childhood amid civil war in Mexico, the opposition of an unsympathetic father, the difficulty of learning English in America: all these aspects of Limon's story engrossed these viewers.
 The production's economy of means is part of its pleasure. The four other actors (directed by Brad Malow) each take up to six roles; the four musicians play at the back of the stage; a set of steel rods easily becomes a variety of settings. Charles Greenberg's music takes Barbara Zinn Krieger's lyrics and sets them in vocally narrow little patterns along Sondheimian lines. There are no huge anthems or elaborate ensembles, just unpretentious use of basic melody and rhythm to tuck aspects of Limon's story engagingly into the nervous system. 
 The musical grows more plodding when Limon commits himself to the arts and, finally, to serious modern dance. What performers could ever act, sing and then also show us the rare dance qualities that distinguished Limon and the other eminent dance figures who shaped his career? Several children, reasonably but silently, wriggled now and then. Limon's big solo caused one boy to exclaim, ''Ugh!'' Yet the show rides these flaws. Though it can't show how Limon's own art mattered, it makes his personal story an American classic.
 ''Jose Limon: The Making of an Artist'' runs through Friday at Lovinger Theater at Lehman College, 250 Bedford Park Boulevard West, at Goulden Avenue, Bedford Park, the Bronx; Saturday to Wednesday at Symphony Space, 2537 Broadway, at 95th Street; and Feb. 5-13 at Goldstein Theater, Kingsborough Community College, 2001 Oriental Boulevard, Manhattan Beach, Brooklyn; (212) 573-8791, Ext. 246; makingbookssing.org.

HEADLINE: The Meltdown in Home Furnishings

BYLINE: By JULIE SCELFO

 BODY:
PURVEYORS of high-end furniture are far from the only home-related businesses facing hard times. On Monday, Expo Design Center, the Home Depot spinoff, became the latest among a host of well-known retailers and manufacturers to falter in the current economic downturn. And Wednesday, Conde Nast announced that Domino would join a growing list of home design magazines that have shut down recently, with the March issue its last. 
 A press release on the Home Depot Web site announced that the company would close all 34 Expo stores in 13 states, as well as seven other lesser-known design and remodeling stores, resulting in the elimination of 5,000 jobs. ''The Expo business has not performed well financially and is not expected to anytime soon,'' the release said. 
 Earlier this month, Williams-Sonoma, which owns the distressed Pottery Barn brand, announced that it would shed 1,400 jobs, and Waterford Wedgwood, the venerable crystal and china maker, filed for insolvency administration, the British version of bankruptcy protection. Lenox, the 120-year-old American china company, filed for the American version in November. 
 ''The impression everybody in this industry seems to have is that because this economic meltdown started with the housing market, anything related to home got slammed first and worst, and that included home furnishings,'' said Warren Shoulberg, the editor of Home Furnishings News, a trade publication. ''Other than the auto industry, I think the home furnishings industry has pretty much gotten hit the worst.''
 Bankruptcy courts have also been inundated with filings from regional furniture stores (including Levitz, Wickes Furniture, Domain Home, the RoomSource, and Sofa Express and More), mattress companies (Mattress Discounters and Dormia), and chains that sell large amounts of home merchandise (like the Bombay Company, Linens 'n Things and Fortunoff). Several department stores -- a retail category that can account for up to 20 percent of home furnishing sales -- have sought bankruptcy protection, including, Mervyns, Boscov's and Value City Department Stores. 
 Other companies have avoided filing for bankruptcy but are showing signs of trouble. Recently, Tempur-Pedic announced that its fourth-quarter earnings for 2008 fell 97 percent from that period a year earlier; Sealy posted a $42 million loss for that quarter; and Simmons said it failed to make a $7.9 million interest payment, putting the company at risk of default. Share prices for Cost Plus and Pier One Imports have dipped so low that market analysts are questioning their ability to survive. 
 ''If you had a billion dollars, you could buy the entire portfolio of publicly traded furniture companies, including Thomasville and La-Z-Boy, and still have money left over to go to McDonald's,'' said Ray Allegrezza, the editor of Furniture Today, a trade magazine. ''These are all brands that a couple of years ago, you couldn't touch. That paints a picture of how dramatically the entire home furnishings landscape has been affected.'' 
 Mr. Shoulberg and other analysts believe that some home furnishing companies were forced into bankruptcy because they were not doing well to begin with. ''Linens 'n Things was heavily loaded down with debt and was a perennial also-ran to Bed Bath & Beyond,'' Mr. Shoulberg said. ''When times got tough, businesses that weren't as well-run and well-positioned were the first ones hit.''
 Jerry Epperson, a furniture and mattress industry analyst at Mann, Armistead & Epperson in Richmond, Va., said the economy was so bad that ''even well-run businesses that weren't overleveraged a year ago are overleveraged today. Business is off 20, 25 percent.'' 
 Home furnishings retailers are likely to remain vulnerable throughout the recession, said Joseph Feldman, an analyst at the Telsey Advisory Group in Manhattan who studies retail markets, because consumers no longer believe they should buy new things when what they have is adequate. 
 ''If you've got less in your pocket and you're worried about putting food on the table, you're not going to be buying new throw pillows just because Pottery Barn has a new color,'' Mr. Feldman said. ''Given the state of the economy, consumers are doing more with what they have.''
 This new reality has gripped the publishing industry as well. In just the last three months, the magazines Cottage Living, Country Home and O at Home have folded. Now Domino, a four-year-old title that had grown to a readership of more than 800,000, has become the eighth major home design magazine to cease publication since November 2007 -- when Conde Nast shocked many in the industry by shuttering another of its home magazines, the 106-year-old House & Garden.

HEADLINE: Times Company's Quarterly Profit Falls 48% as Advertising Declines

BYLINE: By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA

 BODY:
Battered by a steep drop in newspaper advertising, TheNew York Times Company on Wednesday reported fourth-quarter income of $27.6 million, or 19 cents a share, down 47.8 percent from a year earlier.
 Net income in the period a year ago was $53 million, or 37 cents a share.
 For the year, the company lost $57.8 million, after taking more than $300 million in noncash charges. That compared with a profit of $208.7 million in 2007. 
 Anticipating a continued slide in 2009 and the maturity of some debt, the company has recently sought cash infusions from several sources. Last week, it announced that it was borrowing $250 million from the Mexican billionaire Carlos Slim Helu. It was also seeking a sale-leaseback of its headquarters building in Manhattan as well as the sale of its stake in the Boston Red Sox. 
 On a cash basis, the Times Company continued to operate in positive territory for the fourth quarter and the year. Before depreciation, amortization and write-downs, the company had an operating profit of $118.5 million in the quarter, down 25.6 percent, and $301.7 million for the year, down 33.9 percent.
 Over all, revenue fell 10.8 percent in the fourth quarter, to $772 million, and 7.7 percent for the year, to $2.9 billion. Revenue from advertising, the largest revenue source for the company, fell 17.6 percent, to $468.8 million, in the quarter, and 13.1 percent, to $1.78 billion, for the year.
 ''The disruptions of the global economy are affecting all businesses and industries, especially companies, such as ours, that generate a significant portion of their revenues from advertising,'' the president and chief executive, Janet L. Robinson, said in a statement.
 Even digital advertising, long the company's brightest spot, declined in the fourth quarter, though it remained higher for the year. 
 The company's About Group, which includes the information and advice site About.com and a collection of other Internet properties, recorded a 2.9 percent decline in revenue in the quarter, to $29.8 million, and a 12.3 percent increase, to $115.3 million, for the year.
 Revenue from all of the company's Internet businesses, including NYTimes.com, About.com, Boston.com and other Web sites, also decreased 2.9 percent, to $92.5 million, in the fourth quarter. Internet advertising declined 3.5 percent, to $81.9 million. 
 For the year, total Internet revenue increased 6.5 percent, to $351.7 million, and Internet advertising increased 9.3 percent, to $308.8 million. 
 Revenue at the company's New York Times Media Group, which consists primarily of the flagship Times newspaper, dropped 9.2 percent, to $516.6 million in the quarter; advertising revenue fell 16.9 percent, to $295 million. For the year, advertising at the Times Media Group declined 12 percent, to $1.1 billion. Total revenue dropped 6.2 percent, to $1.9 billion.
 Advertising revenue at the New England unit, which includes The Boston Globe, dropped 21.3 percent, to $78.5 million, for the quarter, and 18 percent, to $319 million, for the year.
 Times shares closed up 7 percent, at $5.98.
 The company cut operating costs by 8.5 percent in the quarter, and 4.7 percent for the year. It recently closed its City and Suburban subsidiary, a newspaper and magazine distributor in the New York metropolitan area, which will further reduce costs this year.
 The company's net income of 19 cents a share in the last quarter included 10 cents for severance costs, primarily from City and Suburban. Analysts' predictions, which add back those costs, averaged 27 cents. That put the company slightly ahead of expectations on a comparable basis, at 29 cents a share.
 The company faces the expiration in May of one of two $400 million revolving lines of credit. It reported Wednesday that it had $380 million outstanding on those accounts at year's end, part of a total debt load of $1.1 billion.
 In addition, the company has a $99 million debt payment due in November, and a $250 million payment in March 2010.
 The company also announced that it had retained the investment firm Goldman Sachs to help explore the sale of its 17.8 percent stake in New England Sports Ventures, which owns the Boston Red Sox as well as Fenway Park, part of a cable sports network and other properties.

HEADLINE: These Jewels Look Smaller In France

BYLINE: By CINTRA WILSON

 BODY:
THE timing was a bit inauspicious: Right as our rogue economy gravitationally collapsed into a swirling vacuum, Mauboussin, the 180-year-old French jewelry firm, opened its American flagship. Expansion was its plan, and it stuck to it, despite grim projections casting long shadows over the fripperous world of luxury. Mauboussin had, after all, successfully weathered the Great Depression in the same way it intends to do it now: by making items more affordable, and for a wider clientele. 
 ''It is the end of the rapture, the crash of the hubris, '' Mauboussin's chief executive, Alain Nemarq, said recently in Le Figaro in an article decrying some of the greedier tendencies of the luxury market (like the practice, by some firms, of marking their goods up to 1,000 percent of the cost). ''We will now return to reason, decency and discretion.'' 
 In this spirit, Mauboussin has boldly taken up residence on one of the snobbiest blocks of Madison Avenue, infusing it with the tenacious French qualities of rash hope, intellectual vigor, epicurean sensuality and a soupcon of old-fashioned communism (egalite, if you prefer). The result is a four-story town house that looks as if it were designed by Jean Cocteau's Freudian analyst on a laudanum bender, and lots of sparkly, quasi-affordable cocktail rings in cheery, colorful quartz. 
 The theatrics commence the moment you step into the foyer composed of broken glass. Inside, the shopper is wowed by what looks like a gargantuan Dale Chihuly paperweight made of Jonathan Livingston crystal Seagulls, offset by black sandpaper walls hand-stitched with copper wire into the shapes of half-finished picture-frame moldings. This dark first floor is where time is kept -- gold and titanium watches with cognac alligator wristbands and enormous faces, the diamond eyes of which stare up at you and ask: ''Is Depression 2.0 over yet? Because even my heroically reasonable price point is $13,250.'' 
 It's a very pleasing eyeful, an enthusiastic execution of the designer David Rockwell's wish for the environment to be ''like a dream.'' The staff is tres charmant and seems to be relaxed and genuine in that way of people not working on commission. 
 I was informed that these were not, in fact, the building's original floors, but planks imported from Siberia, with charred highlights achieved by hand-burning each plank. I pictured gulag inmates being forced to do this with creme brulee torches. (Perhaps we should have written nicer plays about the Kremlin, tovarich.)
 I asked Caroline Anderson, a French saleswoman, to explain the difference between French and American tastes in jewelry. ''Americans like big cocktail rings,'' she said. She indicated a shape on her hand the size of a brioche. ''The French prefer to wear something ...'' -- she blushed -- ''a little smaller.''
 Mauboussin's clever means of catering to each customer according to her abilities was introduced with the Fou de Toi (Crazy for You ) line: small, relatively affordable green quartz and morganite gems, in polite pave settings ($2,090). If that's not crazy enough for you, there is Trop Fou de Toi -- the same, only with larger gems and more romantic obsession. Or, for the true sociopath with all her Ponzi schemes successfully laundered and offshore, there is the Tellement Fou de Toi line (rings, $10,690), representing insane, stalkerlike love and gems so large they can be worn only in Texas. 
 I admired an enormous black watch made of space-shuttle ceramic, so ornately gobbed with black lacquer and diamonds that I thought it should come with a complimentary tankard of P. Diddy's I Am King cologne ($30,350). I was moved to try on a 17.08-carat yellow diamond ring ($617,000) because I wanted to see if I could actually burn down the Longchamp Building across the street with it.
 The second floor features slate-colored walls, with the incomplete picture-frame motif scraffito'ed into them, and the Etoile Marine collection by the actress-sculptor-ex-model Marine Delterme, who not only creates a fetching line of pave starfish and sculptures for Mauboussin but also has the advantage of being best friends with Mme. Carla Bruni-Sarkozy, the French president's thrilling wife. 
 There is some superlative Art Deco design, a Mauboussin specialty: a choker and bracelet from 1928 with strings of pave gum balls encircled by emerald-cut baguettes (bracelet, $286,000; necklace, $515,000) and pave calla lilies, a sexy and curvaceous design the firm has been making since the 1940s. 
 The real drama comes when one emerges from the dark, sparkling stairway onto the ''bridal floor,'' a blizzard-white riot of feathered wall panels and crinoline tufting down from the ceiling; one feels one is being hatched under the corps de ballet of ''Swan Lake.'' This floor has a diamond bar, where prospective matrimonials can choose diamonds in a liberal range of sizes (with prices clearly and mercifully marked) and install them in classic Mauboussin settings. 
 This is a soft revolution, a break with the practice at American diamond stores, where shopping for engagement rings is a solemnized and somewhat stressfully churchlike experience of awe and trembling before the altar of massive debt. Mauboussin seems intent on restoring humanity to the act of diamond shopping; it has a little cafe area on the fourth floor where you can enjoy the agony of wedding-band decisions over cappuccino and petits fours, and explore Lucite bento boxes full of cocktail jewelry, which are the centerpiece of each table. 
 I WAS honored with a visit from Violaine Bernbach, a ravishing French incarnation of Anne Bancroft, who happens to be Mauboussin's vice president (and my new role model). ''In France, quality of life is much more important than making money,'' she told me, her tasteful diamonds gesticulating elegantly. ''French people don't need two cars. We like vacation time! Why have so much money if you have no time to enjoy it?'' 
 Mauboussin's philosophy strives toward a balanced fusion of lifestyle choices that includes art, music, food ... and jewelry; a process that aims to creates an environment of sensual harmony, where one is encouraged to breathe and converse, eat and drink, laugh and relax. 
 But, if that kind of thing doesn't ring your bell, Hermes is just a block away. A David Yurman store will be opening next door, and Graff, the esteemed jeweler on the corner, will always be there to soberly intimidate you. 
 MAUBOUSSIN
 714 Madison Avenue (near 63rd Street); (212) 752-4300
 ILS POUSSE Despite economic calamity, this historic jewelry house is bravely expanding through its second American depression. 
 C'EST JUSTE The company is addressing the changing luxury market by stressing affordability, and a creative lifestyle. Vive la difference! 
 MA BOURSE Let's face it, kids: Even reasonable prices for serious jewelry are still harrowing. But I'm guessing it's where Wall Street's chastened bailout wives will be spending your tax money.

HEADLINE: Why Knicks See a Shot At Keeping Lee

BYLINE: By HOWARD BECK

 BODY:
With every game and every double-double, David Lee shreds another piece of conventional wisdom: that he can't shoot, can't score, can't play for Mike D'Antoni, can't be an everyday starter. One stubborn assumption still stands: that Lee can't stay with the Knicks.
 That premise needs a re-examination as well. 
 It is generally understood that the Knicks are conserving salary-cap space for 2010, also known as the Summer of LeBron. Spending tens of millions on Lee, a restricted free agent in July, would seem to run contrary to that goal.
 But Knicks officials believe they can retain Lee, and there are forces working in their favor: a poor economy, a deep free-agent class and a small pool of teams with significant cap space.
 Lee, 25, is expected to seek at least $10 million per season. Based on current projections -- and assuming the cap stays flat, which many executives expect -- only seven teams will have $7 million or more in cap room this summer.
 Three of those teams -- Miami, Atlanta and Minnesota -- can be scratched off the list immediately:
 Miami has to renounce the rights to Shawn Marion to get under the cap (by about $7 million), and the Heat, like many teams, is holding cap space for 2010.
 Atlanta has to renounce the rights to Mike Bibby and Josh Childress to create cap room (about $11 million), and the Hawks also have a decision to make on their own restricted free agent, Marvin Williams. Atlanta's frontcourt is already well stocked, with Josh Smith, Al Horford and Williams.
 Minnesota could have up to $14 million in cap room, but the Timberwolves have a budding All-Star at center, 24-year-old Al Jefferson, and a promising rookie power forward, Kevin Love. The Timberwolves have greater needs in the backcourt.
 That leaves Oklahoma City, Memphis, Portland and Detroit as the most likely suitors for Lee. Again, there are qualifiers.
 The Trail Blazers could have about $10 million in cap room, and they are fond of Lee. But Portland has one of the best young frontcourt tandems in the league, with LaMarcus Aldridge and Greg Oden, so they would most likely be spending $10 million to make Lee a backup.
 The Pistons can clear about $20 million in cap space by renouncing the rights to Rasheed Wallace and Allen Iverson. Detroit is primed for a roster overhaul, but would prefer to spend those millions in 2010, potentially on LeBron James, Dwyane Wade or Chris Bosh.
 If all of those assumptions stand, it leaves two teams to chase Lee: the Thunder and the Grizzlies. Both should have about $20 million in cap room. Both need frontcourt help. If Lee is willing to sacrifice big-city glitz for a big-time payday in a small-time market, these are likely destinations.
 Still, there is the broader market to consider. Not every team will use its cap space. There will be more than a dozen desirable free agents this summer. Simple math dictates that some will have to accept less than they want.
 The list includes five current or former All-Stars (Iverson, Wallace, Marion, Jason Kidd, Ron Artest) and three top-shelf veterans (Mike Bibby, Andre Miller, Lamar Odom). Carlos Boozer, an All-Star power forward, could also be on the market if he opts out of his contract with Utah, which he has hinted he will do. The younger tier includes Childress, Williams, Ben Gordon, Raymond Felton, Linas Kleiza, Paul Millsap, Charlie Villanueva, Nate Robinson, Trevor Ariza and Leon Powe. 
 Lee will be a restricted free agent, so the Knicks will have the right to match any offer. If the market is indeed depressed, they may not have any problem doing so. If Lee commands $10 million or more, they have a tougher decision. But it is not automatic that they would let him walk.
 Having shed the contracts of Jamal Crawford and Zach Randolph this season in trades, the Knicks' 2010 payroll stands at $23.6 million -- about $35 million below the current salary cap, with room to sign two superstars to maximum deals.
 Signing Lee could put a crimp in those plans, though the Knicks would still have ample room to sign one superstar. They can further improve their position by moving Eddy Curry ($11.3 million in 2010) and/or Jared Jeffries ($6.9 million).
 In any case, the Knicks are unlikely to trade Lee before the Feb. 19 deadline, and they are not actively shopping him. He earns just $1.8 million, which makes it difficult to acquire a player of equal value. And teams may not be willing to give up much, knowing that Lee could walk away this summer. 
 A Western Conference executive said that Lee would be ''one of the more sought-after guys'' this summer, because of his youth, his production and his rapid improvement. (The executive spoke on condition of anonymity because of league tampering rules.)
 ''He's someone you could make one of your top four players,'' he said.
 The Knicks think so, too, which is why -- contrary to conventional wisdom -- they will do everything reasonably possible to keep him. LeBron James needs good teammates, after all.

HEADLINE: All Dressed Up Like Art Galleries

BYLINE: By RUTH LA FERLA

 BODY:
ANNIE PEDRET eyed a standard-issue sawhorse improbably dressed up in fleece. ''I'd love to have that in my bedroom to put clothes over,'' she said, apparently prepared to part with $750 to turn that conceptual artwork into a high-ticket coat hanger. Ms. Pedret, an associate professor of architectural history at the University of Illinois at Chicago, could have been forgiven. 
 The sawhorse, one of several by Cheryl Pope, a local artist, was on view, after all, not in a gallery, but at a fashion boutique on North Damen Avenue, a mercantile thoroughfare that is home to the likes of Marc Jacobs and Club Monaco. That it vied for attention with satin cocktail dresses and oversize cardigans was fine with Robin Richman, the owner of the shop that bears her name. She is mounting the works of emerging artists to fill space once reserved for fashion labels she can no longer afford to sell, and to pique the interest of her worldly clientele. 
 ''In this economy,'' Ms. Richman observed, ''we have to be really inventive.'' 
 Those words would surely resonate with merchants across the country who have transformed their boutiques into one-stop emporiums offering gladiator sandals alongside rare lithographs and vivid oils on canvas. And these days they have as compelling a ring for scores of artists forced by a rocky commercial climate to seek new settings for their work. As the galleries that once embraced them succumb to soaring overheads and declining sales, some have taken to exhibiting in restaurants and hotel and condo lobbies. Even more are seeking refuge in the fashion world. 
 Exhibition in a dress shop? ''You can't say no,'' said Monica Serra, who agreed to show her moody portraits, priced at about $10,000 each, at Mina, a boutique in downtown Manhattan, after the Miami outpost of her German gallery shuttered last month. ''If the economy was different, I might have thought twice. I might have been worried that the art world wouldn't take me seriously. But what are you going to do -- stockpile your paintings because the venue is not right?'' 
 Quite a few of her peers have adopted a similarly flexible attitude. In exhibiting alongside camisoles and candles, they have stood convention on its head: If their presence once lent cachet to the clothes, today it is the artist who seeks to borrow fashion's luster. 
 Juan Angel Chavez, whose sculptures and large-scale artworks have been shown at the Museum of Contemporary Art in Chicago, did not hesitate to mount an installation -- a raffish collage of urban street signs -- in the designated gallery space of Ms. Richman's store. ''I'm a very opportunistic artist, Mr. Chavez said last week as he scoped out the room, which was filled with the collectors, scholars, artists and architects who are among Ms. Richman's clients. ''If you stay in your studio, none of these people will see you.''
 Artists like Mr. Chavez have put a literal spin on Andy Warhol's dictum that a store is something of cultural repository, the contemporary equivalent of a museum. That notion is not lost on Confederacy, a cavernous retail space in Los Angeles selling frocks by Zac Posen and Mr. Jacobs, and etchings by blue-chip artists including Francis Bacon and Francesco Clemente. 
 When Baco, a cafe-boutique-and-gallery opens in Dumbo in the shadow of the Brooklyn Bridge in March, visitors will be invited to sip mocha lattes as they try on jewelry and inspect the paintings on the walls, priced up to $3,000. Neighborhood artists are pleading with him to show their work, Motti Berco, the owner, said. ''They come to me because they expect there will be a lot of traffic here.'' 
 That would be nothing, of course, to the traffic at the suburban malls that are home to the youth-oriented Metropark chain that sells CDs, fur-lined hoodies and raucously colorful art prints. 
 A scant half-dozen years ago, in hermetic art circles, showing in even the most rarefied retail environment was veritable heresy. ''Tradition dictated that art be displayed in a clean space on a white wall, with nothing around it,'' said Linda Warren, a dealer in Chicago. To stray outside the confines of the white cube was, she said, to risk a ''perception that the artist is selling out.'' 
 Last year Ms. Warren broke with tradition when she oversaw an installation by Carson Fox, at Neapolitan, an upscale boutique in suburban Winnetka, Ill. When Ms. Fox, an artist well known for her resin floral sculptures, agreed to exhibit, Ms. Warren was taken aback: ''But I thought, 'If she thinks it's not beneath her, why should I?' '' 
 There is also a perception that a merchant of even the finest jumpers or jeans, is a dilettante, too distracted or ill-informed to give the art its due. 
 ''With clients there is a lot of hand-holding and a lot of scholarship involved,'' said Island Weiss, a dealer in Manhattan. A shopkeeper as gallery owner? No problem, if the merchant is committed to the job, Mr. Weiss maintained. ''Selling an Andrew Wyeth tempera isn't the same as selling a dress.'' 
 But as galleries continue to shutter -- at the rate of about one a week in Chelsea, in Manhattan, according to Kathy Murphy, who is the publisher of the art monthly Modern Painters -- such once-rigid standards are yielding. As an emerging artist, ''you do whatever you need to do -- you have to get by,'' said Gracie Mansion, who is no stranger to the improvised exhibition space, having famously shown and sold art works in the early '80s from the back seat of a limousine. 
 Andrea Salerno, a curator, organized an exhibition last summer at the Tahari boutique in East Hampton, N.Y., in advance of the Scope Hamptons Art Fair. She recalled that the collectors stopping at the store didn't raise an eyebrow. Nor did the artists, prominent figures including Alice Aycock, Lynda Benglis and Bryan Hunt. On being approached, ''the artists were all ears,'' impressed perhaps by the location, Ms. Salerno said. ''You can't turn your nose up at Main and Job's Lane.'' 
 AS long as the artist's intention and the context of the work is not compromised, said Amy Cappellazzo, a deputy chairwoman at Christie's Americas, showing in a retail space is ''great, why not?'' 
 As Ms. Cappellazzo pointed out, the boutique-as-gallery phenomenon, is hardly without precedent. In the 1980s, the Japanese retail giant Seibu sold lithographs by Matisse and Braques. In London, the venerable Liberty department store has long housed a gallery. The granny of all concept stores, 10 Corso Como in Milan, has exhibited artists' works in the same selling space as billowy dresses and fountain pens. Prada lent the trend new impetus in 2001 by hanging a photographic mural of the German monumentalist Andreas Gursky in its SoHo boutique. In recent years Hermes has exhibited fine art photos in its Madison Avenue shop. 
 And if stores once sought to cash in on an artist's prestige, today it is the artist who stands to reap the benefits. Jamel Shabazz, whose photographs of hip-hop culture have been published in book form and shown at shops like Harriet's Alter Ego in Brooklyn, said that exhibiting at boutiques has exposed his work to the influential ''downtown crowd.'' ''I have heard from my publisher that some of my success is due to these boutiques,'' said Mr. Shabazz, who work was shown recently at the Bronx Museum of the Arts. 
 Nor does it much matter that some cutting-edge merchants juxtapose wares in ways once deemed unthinkable. At Confederacy, in boho-hip East Hollywood, a series of Julian Schnabel etchings, marked at $12,000 a piece, face off against a row of swaybacked mannequins wearing radically abbreviated underwear. Ilaria Urbinati, a partner in the shop, with the actor and D.J. Danny Masterson, recalled that it was her mother, the respected Los Angeles dealer Fiorella Urbinati, who encouraged her to take a swipe at convention. 
 ''I was shocked at first: my mother is such a huge art snob,'' the younger Ms. Urbinati recalled. ''But she has always told me that in the art scene you have to be innovative.'' 
 Such inventive strategies whet consumer appetites and even those of dealers. Steven Borts, the owner of the Light Gallery in Costa Mesa, Calif., which sells both clothes and pieces by surf, skateboard and tiki artists, was mildly surprised to find that galleries had taken note. ''They see that we've taken a risk,'' he said, ''and that we've been drawing pretty goods crowds.'' 
 Not long after he mounted shows of tiki art, and the hand-shaped surfboards of Rory Russell, the pipeline legend, neighboring galleries held similar shows. Mr. Borts was delighted.
 ''It feels good to be an influence,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Union Growth in 2008 Was Largest in 25 Years

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE

 BODY:
Union membership in the United States rose last year by the largest amount in a quarter-century, a gain of 428,000 members, the Bureau of Labor Statistics announced on Wednesday. 
 The bureau said that most of the new members were government employees and that the percentage of workers in unions rose to 12.4 percent of the overall work force last year, up from 12.1 percent in 2007.
 The increase is bound to fuel an already feverish political debate over whether to enact a labor-backed bill that would make it easier for workers to unionize. Business groups that oppose the bill can point to the new report to argue that such legislation is unnecessary because unions are already growing under current law.
 But union leaders said Wednesday that it remained far too difficult to unionize workers in the private sector. 
 Most Democrats support the bill, the Employee Free Choice Act, saying that making it easier for unions to grow will help strengthen the nation's middle class during tough economic times. But Republicans denounce the bill because it would give workers the right to gain union recognition as soon as a majority signed cards saying they wanted a union, rather than through secret-ballot elections.
 According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, 36.8 percent of government employees belong to unions, compared with just 7.6 percent of workers in the private sector. Typically, state and city officials do not fight unionization efforts, while private-sector employers, fearing higher labor costs, often vigorously resist organizing drives. 
 The bureau noted that the percentage of workers in unions has dropped from 20.1 percent in 1983, with the decline especially noteworthy among private-sector workers because of a sharp drop in manufacturing jobs as a result of plant closings and pressures from imports. The bureau said 11.4 percent of manufacturing workers, once the heart of organized labor, were in unions. 
 The bureau said 16.1 million workers belonged to unions at the end of 2008. The number of unionized government workers grew by 275,000 last year and the number of unionized private sector workers grew by slightly more than 150,000.
 Some economists discounted as a statistical fluke the bureau's report last year that the number of unionized workers had jumped by 311,000 in 2007. Unions have made significant gains in organizing by persuading various governors and state legislatures to allow the unionization of tens of thousands of teachers, home-health aides and home-based child care providers.

HEADLINE: A Swiss Village Has Peace, Quiet and a Product Endorsed by Marilyn Manson

BYLINE: By JOHN TAGLIABUE

DATELINE: KALLNACH, Switzerland 

 BODY:
Few people in this quiet village of quaint chalets know the album ''Eat Me, Drink Me,'' by Marilyn Manson, the shock rocker. But almost everyone knows his taste for absinthe.
 There could hardly be a greater contrast between Mr. Manson, the American bad boy who introduced the golden age of grotesque, and the 1,500 people who live quietly in the squat farmhouses strung out along Kallnach's main street, their eaves reaching almost to the ground.
 ''They're completely different,'' said Beat Laderach, 47, who has been the town manager for 17 years. ''We live off the land, a very sleepy existence. But it has its advantages: There is little unemployment, no vandalism; life is modest, comfortable, friendly.'' 
 Yet Mr. Manson's link to the town ''is important for us,'' Mr. Laderach said. The name Kallnach has become well known, he said, thanks to the success of a superpremium absinthe developed with Mr. Manson.
 In a sense, the hills and valleys northwest of Kallnach, otherwise known for clocks, could be called the cradle of absinthe. Wormwood, absinthe's defining ingredient, as well as the other herbs that go into it, grow in abundance here, deep in Switzerland's Jura Mountains. In the late 19th century, absinthe was so popular that in Paris it rivaled wine as the drink of choice. French impressionists, like Edgar Degas and Edouard Manet, not only drank it, but featured it in their works. 
 But absinthe, a liqueur that can have an alcohol content as high as 75 percent, was also known as the Green Fairy, a malicious sprite that was said to twist men's -- and women's -- minds and cause delirium, hallucinations, vertigo and even madness.
 By the early 20th century, governments around the world were banning it. Absinthe lovers denied its toxicity, and blamed the wine industry for seeking to sideline a competitor. (Modern analysis has shown that the absinthes produced today have none of these effects.)
 So how did the link between the shock rock singer, actor and artist and this drowsy village come about? It began in 2005, after Switzerland, following the example of the United States and many countries in Europe, legalized the production of absinthe.
 The man who revived absinthe in Kallnach is Oliver Matter, whose great-grandfather first distilled schnapps here in the 1920s and shipped products to the Chicago World's Fair in 1933 under the brand name Will Tell. 
 In 2004, just two months before absinthe was legalized by a Swiss national referendum, Mr. Matter turned his stills, big copper spheres in a shed just outside of town, to making the liqueur. ''Actually I didn't want to,'' he said, leading a visitor through the still. ''But I had a recipe. My great-grandfather was once owed money by a livestock trader who couldn't pay him, so he gave him a recipe for absinthe instead. I had big mountains of my great-grandfather's papers, and that's where I found the recipe.''
 After absinthe was banned by the Swiss in 1910, it went underground. ''You could find it in every household,'' said Mr. Matter, 40, a lanky man with a shaven head. ''It was kept as medicine.''
 By one guess, more than 20,000 gallons of this moonshine absinthe were produced annually, an estimate made possible because the orderly Swiss were meticulous about paying the alcohol tax.
 Obviously, the world was ripe for the return of absinthe. Within days of beginning production, Mr. Matter was contacted by distributors seeking to sell his absinthe in big markets like England, France and the United States, where absinthe was rapidly becoming a craze. 
 One of the distributors who contacted Mr. Matter was Markus Lion, 41, a compact, lively businessman from southern Germany who was looking for quality absinthe for a particular customer, Marilyn Manson, whose manager was friendly with Mr. Lion. ''Absinthe was becoming a topic,'' Mr. Lion said. ''And Manson was known as a connoisseur of absinthe.''
 After a concert in Basel, a Swiss city northeast of here, Mr. Lion met Mr. Manson, a k a Brian Hugh Warner, and discovered they had friends and tastes in common, including absinthe. They agreed to produce a special absinthe, to be called Mansinthe, at Mr. Matter's distillery.
 After several trial distillations, Mansinthe was introduced in the summer of 2006, selling for about $65 for a 24-ounce bottle. Sales soared in the remaining months of 2006, to more than four times the total amount of absinthe Mr. Matter sold the year before. Now absinthe accounts for about half his annual sales of $1.3 million.
 Soon the name Manson was on everyone's tongue in Kallnach. Now Fritz Meyer, 68, stocks Mansinthe on the liquor shelves of his butcher and grocery store along Kallnach's main road, next to bottles of Jack Daniel's and Baileys Irish Cream. He sells pork sausages flavored with absinthe. ''They're very popular,'' he said.
 Mansinthe, Mr. Lion said, ''gave a real push to the absinthe world.''
 ''We didn't have to do much else,'' he continued. ''Manson was already a very controversial figure, just like the artists of the 19th century. So for me he was the ideal partner.''
 Mr. Matter, who now has a T-shirt with the words ''The Manson Gang'' and ''66.6 percent,'' for the alcohol content of Mansinthe, said he was astounded by how well Mr. Manson was accepted locally, though he had never visited the village. ''Curiously, no one ever came to us and said, 'Why are you doing something like this?' ''
 Stefan Johner, 19, said he was not surprised. An apprentice mechanic who fixes tractors, he said he had never tried absinthe, preferring beer or wine, or whiskey or vodka if he wanted stronger drink. But he agreed that absinthe had a ''certain tradition'' locally.
 Did Marilyn Manson fit in that tradition? ''A little bit for sure,'' he said. ''He's a little bit crazy,'' he went on, his hands deep in the pockets of greasy blue overalls. ''In Kallnach there are perfectly normal people, but also some who are a little bit crazy.''

HEADLINE: Starbucks to Close 300 Stores and Open Fewer New Ones

BYLINE: By CLAIRE CAIN MILLER

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO 

 BODY:
Starbucks's chief executive, Howard D. Schultz, told Wall Street analysts in November that the company's worst times might be behind it. But as the economic doldrums persist and customers continue to cut back, Starbucks is being forced to make more cuts. 
 The coffee store chain announced on Wednesday that it would close 300 more stores, affecting 6,000 employees, and would lay off 700 employees who don't work in stores. Starbucks also reduced the number of new company-owned stores it plans to open this year to 310, from 470. 
 Mr. Schultz first announced a slowdown in store openings a year ago, before most companies had begun to feel the effects of a recession. At the time, sales growth at stores open at least a year was positive. Then in July, Starbucks said it would close 600 stores. In December, he outlined new cost-cutting plans.
 Now, Mr. Schultz is preparing for a deeper recession. 
 ''These decisions have been made to ensure the company is leaner and prepared to endure a worsening economic climate,'' Mr. Schultz said Wednesday in a letter to employees. 
 In a conference call with Wall Street analysts on Wednesday, Mr. Schultz said the new cuts were necessary because of the unprecedented dip in consumer confidence and the rapid weakening of the economy ''by virtually all statistical measures.'' 
 Still, he said, ''I can assure you Starbucks is a company with solid, sound fundamentals and a plan to win.'' 
 On Wednesday, the company also reported that net income in the first quarter fell to $64.3 million, or 9 cents a share, from $208.1 million, or 28 cents a share, in the period a year ago, a decline of 69 percent. Revenue fell 5.5 percent, to $2.6 billion from $2.77 billion in the quarter a year ago. 
 Sales at Starbucks stores open at least a year fell 9 percent in the first quarter. Over the three months that ended Dec. 28, 5 percent fewer people visited Starbucks stores and those who did spent 4 percent less. 
 Of the 700 layoffs, half will be at the company's support center in Seattle, the company said. Of the 6,000 workers at the stores, Mr. Schultz said, Starbucks hoped that turnover and attrition would allow it to place many of the employees ''elsewhere in its store organization.'' 
 Most of the remaining closings will occur this year. 
 As part of the cuts, Mr. Schultz will reduce his salary to less than $10,000 a year, from $1.2 million. 
 ''The decisions we make are about preserving the future of Starbucks,'' he wrote in the letter to employees. 
 The company will take other cost-cutting measures, including renegotiating prices with landlords and suppliers, trimming vacation and personal days for hourly store employees and adjusting the way individual stores operate. For example, the company announced on Tuesday that stores where few customers order decaffeinated coffee after noon will no longer brew the coffee ahead of time and will instead make it on demand. 
 The cuts will increase projected savings this year $400 million to $500 million, the company said. While cutting costs, Starbucks is trying to appeal to newly value-conscious customers. It offers loyalty cards that provide discounts and over the holidays sold prepaid debit cards in bulk at a 20 percent discount at Costco. In March, Starbucks will introduce new breakfast combination meals ''to challenge misconceptions about affordability,'' Mr. Schultz said. 
 Some of the cost cuts are already beginning to bolster profit margins, noted Sharon Zackfia, a partner at William Blair & Company who covers the restaurant industry. Starbucks's operating profit margins were 4.5 percent in the first quarter, far below past highs but up from 0.6 percent in the fourth quarter. 
 Starbucks' historically fast-paced growth made it hard to slow down when the recession began, Ms. Zackfia said. It nearly doubled the number of company-owned stores from 2005 to 2007. 
 ''They were on full throttle into the recession, and when a company is growing like that and then the sales start to slow, you literally cannot brake hard enough,'' Ms. Zackfia said. 
 Still, some Starbucks watchers say the chain's problems started well before the economic crisis caused consumer spending to shrivel. 
 ''Starbucks lost its cultural cache, its value, before everyone became conscious of the economic fallout,'' said Bryant Simon, a professor of history and American studies at Temple University who is publishing a book about Starbucks this fall. 
 Customers were deserting Starbucks stores by the beginning of 2007, he said, because its emphasis on frothy, milky, sugary drinks hurt its image as an authentic coffee house. 
 Yet some analysts say that when the economy improves, Starbucks is poised to recover customers. Coffee consumption is rising among young people 18 to 25 years old, the first generation to drink more coffee outside the home than in it, Ms. Zackfia said.

HEADLINE: How Low Will They Go?

BYLINE: By STEVEN KURUTZ

 BODY:
ONE freezing afternoon last week, after spotting a sign for an ''Avalanche Sale: 20-50 Percent Off,'' I stepped into Cite, a cavernous modern furniture store on Greene Street in SoHo. I wandered around for several minutes, and then stopped at a brown, low-slung, three-seater sofa near the front of the showroom. A saleswoman was soon by my side. 
 The sofa was made in the Netherlands, I was told. The designer, Bjorn Mulder, is a big shot in Europe, I was told. The price was $6,447, I was told -- at which point I asked the obvious question: is the sofa part of the avalanche?
 The saleswoman, tall, slim, a little hungry in the eyes, said it was not, but that she could give me the same 20 percent ''to the trade'' discount that she extends to decorators and architects. That brought the price to $5,158 before tax. At this point, I took a breath and steeled myself for something I had never tried before, or even thought to try, in a high-end furniture store: haggling. 
 There has been a lot of talk in the last year about shoppers taking advantage of the economic climate by bargaining with retailers, mostly on volume merchandise like TVs or mattresses. But Manhattan's sanctums of new and vintage modern design were a different matter, it seemed to me. I'd always liked what they sold, but I found the gallery-like stillness of the showrooms intimidating, and the prices were generally too high for me. Until now, anyway, the idea of challenging those prices would have struck me as absurd.
 But these days, the thinking goes that it's a buyer's market for anyone looking to buy anything. And, as it happens, I'm currently in the market for everything, having just moved into a new apartment where the sum total of my decor is two card tables and an old leather recliner. I may not be a regular customer of the design boutiques of SoHo and TriBeCa, but if there is ever going to be a time for me to furnish my home in high style, this would seem to be it. 
 So last week, I set out to test the willingness of home furnishings retailers to bargain. I chose only furnishings that I genuinely liked and might conceivably buy, and kept my other agenda -- reporting this story -- to myself until a final price was arrived at, so as not to influence the proceedings. 
 Before I began, I had to overcome a stumbling block: I'd never haggled in any retail store and wasn't sure how to go about it. Like many people, I don't relish negotiating, especially when it involves money. (I don't think of myself as a pushover, but I don't drive a hard bargain, either.) To educate myself, I called two experts, Robert Verdi, a New York-based style guru to the stars (and a host of the Discovery Channel's now defunct ''Surprise by Design''), and Daniel Shapiro, the associate director of the Harvard Negotiation Project, which conducts research and training on conflict resolution for everything from marital to international border disputes.
 Years before his TV days, Mr. Verdi was in the retail trenches, selling linens at ABC Carpet & Home in Manhattan, and his tips seemed informed by his memories of dealing with flaky shoppers. He recommended being friendly to the salesperson, appearing to be a committed buyer and knowing what you want. ''You don't say, 'I need a table,' '' Mr. Verdi said. ''It should be, 'I'm looking for a round, wood table. I'm flexible with tones.' Then you say, 'I'm interested in buying this. It's a little more than I've budgeted. What's the best you can do?' '' 
 By framing the negotiation as a question instead of a demand, Mr. Verdi said, it ''gives the salesperson the power, as opposed to making them feel bullied.'' 
 Mr. Shapiro, speaking from his home in Arlington, Mass., agreed that establishing a rapport was crucial to successful bargaining, and said he often asks a salesclerk for advice: a tactic that transforms the encounter from ''an adversarial game'' into a joint problem-solving session. Too often, he said, customers consider only their own interests -- that is, getting what they want at a low price. ''I'm always very aware of the interests of the salesperson,'' he said. ''I'm aware they work on commission. I'm aware they want to make a deal. Then it's thinking creatively about options that can meet their interest and my interest.'' 
 Mr. Shapiro, who talks about haggling in academic language, recommended determining ''objective criteria'' in advance -- meaning that I should do some comparison shopping. To illustrate the point, he discussed a recent mattress purchase he and his wife made at a popular bedding chain. ''Before we went to this store, one of the first things I did was look at mattresses on the Internet and at competing stores,'' he said. 
 Armed with knowledge of the market, Mr. Shapiro had firm ground on which to negotiate. The mattress he liked was priced around $2,000. ''I was able to say, 'How does this mattress compare with Mattress X from another store, which is $1,000?' '' When he threw out a number in the $1,400 range, it was quickly accepted by the salesman. ''That was the moment where I realized, this is really negotiable,'' Mr. Shapiro said. He decided to push for greater savings, keeping the conversation theoretical (''I might be interested...''; ''I could possibly buy this mattress if...''). After an hour of bargaining, he bought the mattress, for about $1,200.
 I followed Mr. Shapiro's advice, casing furniture stores for a day before I started haggling. But as impressive as his mattress experience was (and as much as it stung to think of my own past mattress purchases in light of it), I knew it wasn't directly comparable to what I would be attempting. While the ultracompetitive high-volume mattresses business seems ideal for making deals, the custom nature of high-end furniture, not to mention the rarefied atmosphere of stores in which $6,500 sofas are sold, makes haggling a trickier proposition. 
 MY opening strategy with the saleswoman at Cite was a common one. ''Would you give me an additional discount,'' I said, ''if I took the floor model?'' 
 The floor model isn't always for sale, but this one was, and it was in seemingly good condition. She agreed to deduct another 10 percent if I took it, lowering the price to $4,513. I then used a tactic suggested by Mr. Verdi -- ask for the price with tax and delivery ($5,241.56) before bargaining further. This was the second tip of his I'd followed; the first was to shop midweek, when customer traffic is slow and stores may be worried about meeting sales quotas. (During the hour I spent in Cite, in fact, I was the lone customer, a situation I ran into in store after store.)
 Not wanting to fixate -- Mr. Shapiro had warned me of the dangers of seeming too invested in any one thing -- I pointed to another sofa, cheaper by nearly $2,000, and asked what was different about it, and the reasons for its lower price. I returned to the brown sofa and said that I preferred it to the cheaper model, but that the cost was a concern. Finally, I told the saleswoman that if she would accept $4,800, I might be willing to buy it that day. 
 She made an internal calculation, winced briefly and paused. ''How about $5,000?'' she asked. Considering that we'd started $1,500 north of that figure, it seemed to me a fair price that met both of our interests. I still couldn't quite bring myself to pull the trigger (and I decided soon after this to postpone any purchases till the article was done), but I told her that I would think about it. 
 After I revealed to the saleswoman -- whose name is P. J. Casey and who is in fact the owner -- that I was a reporter, we held a posthaggle debriefing. Ms. Casey wasn't surprised that I had bargained; she had expected it. Nearly every customer in recent weeks had tried to haggle. ''You do one go-around of discounts, then the next. It's a dance,'' she said. 
 My haggling style was cordial, and I wondered whether that had led Ms. Casey to be more willing to negotiate. ''Not really,'' she said. ''Money is money. It's just a more difficult experience if someone is a bully.'' She would probably have come down to $4,800 if I'd kept haggling, she told me, although ''it would have made me uncomfortable.'' This admission made me feel even better with the price we reached: Mr. Shapiro cautions against pushing too far and getting a slightly better price but souring the relationship with a store (what if something later goes wrong with the item and you need assistance?). 
 Confident after my early success, I walked a few blocks south to the SoHo franchise of BoConcept, a Danish chain that sells its own furniture line. The pieces have a clean, slightly generic look that, depending on how they're deployed, can either lend a chic simplicity to a space or transform it into a boutique hotel lobby. On a previous visit I had admired a walnut platform bed priced at $1,379, and when a spiky-haired salesman approached, introducing himself as Jackie, I shifted into haggling mode. 
 After several minutes of general conversation about the bed -- during which I carefully avoided discussing price -- I asked if it was on sale.
 ''No,'' Jackie said, grinning widely. 
 Were there any coming sales?
 The store runs a yearly promotion called ''Crazy Bed Day,'' he told me, but I'd missed it. 
 I inquired about a floor model discount, but the bed was in stock, so the floor model wasn't for sale. I next lobbed a vague threat, implying I might take my business elsewhere: many stores sell platform beds -- what was special about this one? 
 Jackie demonstrated how the bed allowed for adjustable mattress height and sang BoConcept's praises as he did so, telling me, ''My whole apartment -- BoConcept.''
 I expressed serious interest in buying the bed if the store would do better on price.
 Same friendly smile, same firm ''No.'' 
 I began to rope-a-dope him, running through various cost-saving possibilities. Does the store give a discount to the trade, and if so would he be willing to extend it to a civilian like me? How about just 10 percent off? Would he take $1,200? The bed is sold in three pieces: headboard, frame and legs. Could he discount one of the pieces? Wasn't there something he could do? 
 ''No'' came the reply time and again. 
 Exhausted, I gave up.
 Jackie later explained that because BoConcept is a chain, prices are set by the company and never reduced. The company, he added, believes its prices are already low for the industry. He conceded that business was slow, but said the store's expenses hadn't changed, and it still needed to make a profit on each sale. 
 I heard variations on these responses at several showrooms. At the Blu Dot store on Wooster Street, which carries the small collection of the Minneapolis furniture company, I tried to haggle over a cafe table priced at $799. The floor model wasn't for sale; I couldn't have the 10 percent trade discount; selling the table for $700 was impossible. The saleswoman mentioned that the store had been open only two months, which might account for her obstinacy. 
 When I pointed out surface scratches as an implied knock on the quality, the saleswoman said the satin finish normally holds up well but there had been a fashion shoot in the store, and models had danced on this table. 
 ''Yes, well,'' I said, ''that happens in my apartment, too.''
 This quip earned me only a thin smile. 
 It was a similar experience uptown at the Conran Shop, where I tried my luck with a less expensive item -- a $225 linen throw. Even a $10 reduction, it seemed, was out of the question. 
 Regardless of how I fared at haggling, though, almost every store I visited had some kind of sale or promotion going on. The Conran Shop was in the final stages of a sale; it ended Jan. 19, but a spokeswoman told me on Tuesday that ''most of the sale items can still be found throughout the shop,'' still at their sale prices, and selected bedding is 25 to 30 percent off. Design Within Reach, which specializes in midcentury reproductions, wouldn't budge on a $2,700 dresser, but the store is offering free shipping through Feb. 3. At Interieurs, a shop in TriBeCa that sells French contemporary furnishings and other pieces, furniture from a Belgian company, Luz, was being sold at repo prices. The slightly damaged floor model of a $3,300 desk and file cabinet set was marked down to $500 -- a $2,800 reduction that I greedily tried to haggle even lower, with no success. 
 The store's owner, Francine Gardner, said she's been resistant to shoppers trying to haggle, but in response to slowing business she has devoted more time to customer service; she recently spent four hours helping a client decorate her apartment, free of charge. 
 The severe markdowns do seem to suggest serious anxiety on the part of retailers, but it can be disconcerting for shoppers, too. Just how much margin exists in the retail world? Have we all drastically overpaid for years? 
 I was beginning to regret having paid full price on everything I'd bought in years past, including furnishings -- a feeling that intensified when I went rug shopping at ABC Carpet & Home, near Union Square. The store's basement had thousands of discounted rugs, stacked like Gap sweaters, with deeply slashed prices. ''$5,499, now $1,199'' was a recurring numerical motif. 
 I've wanted a thick-pile wool rug for a while now, and though they've been too expensive, I hoped the slumping economy had finally brought one within my reach, much as a few setbacks in life might prompt an ex-beauty queen to partner with an average-looking but long-attentive admirer. When I couldn't find a carpet I liked among the discounts, I went up to the first floor and got help from a saleswoman named Melissa, who showed me an angora-wool, champagne-colored shag rug at $5,499. It looked like something from the penthouse apartment of a 1970s cocaine dealer. I loved it. 
 I began to haggle, and without much effort got a 10 percent discount out of Melissa, reducing the price to $4,950. 
 ''How about an Inauguration Day price chop? Today only,'' I said. 
 ''I'll see,'' Melissa said, and consulted an imperious-looking woman sitting behind a desk, who apparently had final say in such matters. The answer came back that I could take another $200 off, for a total of $4,750. 
 I'd reduced the price of the rug by $750. Unfortunately, while I may have the decorating taste of a cocaine dealer, I don't have the same comfort with profligate spending. After some further hemming and hawing, I offered $4,000, the upper reaches of what I was willing to spend (and even then I'd sleep guiltily). Take it or leave it. They left it. 
 Later, I learned that had I selected a rug in stock, as opposed to one that had to be custom made in Turkey, as this one did, I could have worked a much greater price reduction -- in other words, ABC Carpet & Home was willing to make deals on in-store merchandise. 
 Ultimately, that seemed to be the point. In many cases, the willingness of stores to negotiate varied depending on circumstances, and the fact that I had any success at all in using a flea market technique in high-end retail settings suggested to me that I should keep at it. 
 ''I've always had the philosophy that almost everything is negotiable,'' Mr. Shapiro had told me before I set out. ''I've been surprised at how true that is.''

HEADLINE: The Balance Between the We and the I

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re ''What Life Asks of Us,'' by David Brooks (column, Jan. 27):
 The discussion about institutional thinking involves more than simply balancing unfettered individualism with subsuming one's ego for the greater good. 
 The Harvard faculty committee Mr. Brooks refers to was right that we should learn to question conventional thought, to think and act as individuals. We make progress only through unconventional thinking. But we need to frame this individualism within the context of a respect for the institution of our society. 
 Cultures crumble when the balance is lost between the needs of the individual and the needs of the group. 
 As a nation, we are at a philosophical turning point, seeing the consequences of unchecked egocentrism and, let's hope, reconsidering our roles in society. Anthony Silver
 Westport, Conn., Jan. 28, 2009
 The writer is the director of Gray Matters, a company that provides neurofeedback training.
 To the Editor:
 I wholeheartedly endorse David Brooks's defense of institutions and the role they play in giving meaning to our lives. It is no doubt important to recognize the claim that history, community and shared values make on us through them. 
 I disagree, however, with his implied assessment of a liberal education, which he suggests is anathema to such a claim of conformity. On the contrary, the ''presumptions'' and ''the familiar'' that many who value liberal education try to unsettle are precisely those aspects of modern culture that seem to trouble Mr. Brooks -- excessive individualism and an emphasis on personal happiness over dignity, duty and societal obligation. 
 Students who read Plato, Aristotle, Shakespeare and the many other figures who constitute the core of a liberal education cannot but be challenged to rethink the values of modern culture.
 Kristi Sweet 
 College Station, Tex., Jan. 27, 2009
 The writer is an assistant professor of philosophy at Texas A&M University.
 To the Editor:
 Harvard's educational philosophy, which now seems to be the educational philosophy in America -- to ''disorient'' students from the familiar and encourage students to ''reorient themselves'' -- is precisely why we are facing such serious threats to our institutions.
 Disorienting our students by showing them that there are no easy answers leads inexorably to teaching our students that there are no answers. And no human being has the capacity to ''reorient'' himself on his own and without the compass of the past -- that is the very purpose of an education, to ''reorient'' the student by way of the past. 
 It is no wonder people today are unable or unwilling to make moral judgments; their education taught them that morality was relative. 
 It is no wonder they are unwilling to see the institution itself as an enduring and valuable thing above their own personal interests; their education taught them merely to ''think for themselves.''
 The pervasive relativism that is sold as ''education'' in this country is precisely why we are witnessing the disintegration of the institutions that are good and necessary. David Essing 
 Boston, Jan. 27, 2009
 To the Editor:
 David Brooks discusses the political scientist Hugh Heclo's views about how institutions shape our lives in contrast to what many believe is the purpose of liberal education, namely, to develop our individual capacities for critical thinking, self-discovery and personal happiness. 
 Some may consider these distinctions as contradictions that require choosing one or the other as the best explanation of our behavior and life choices. 
 To the contrary, if our liberal education has taught us to use dialectical thinking, we can look for mutuality, reciprocity and a synthesis of such contradictions in order to meaningfully understand ourselves, our communities and our social systems. 
 Arthur T. Himmelman 
 Minneapolis, Jan. 27, 2009
 To the Editor:
 David Brooks's lament for the erosion of institutions in personal and social life is welcome. But he doesn't mention its most important source: the values generated by unconstrained markets relentlessly driven to destroy the old in favor of the new. 
 Banks used to be stable institutions not because bankers were ''stodgy,'' but because government regulations kept them from making risky investments in order to compete for higher profits. 
 The very study of institutions in the economy has virtually disappeared with the ascendancy of free-market fundamentalism in the past 30 years. Universities may have played a role in promoting disrespect for tradition, but to find the root cause, take a trip to the shopping mall. Jeff Faux 
 Washington, Jan. 27, 2009
 The writer is a distinguished fellow at the Economic Policy Institute.
 To the Editor:
 David Brooks reports on two different kinds of educational purposes: one, ''to reveal what is going on beneath and behind appearances,'' and the other, to teach respect for ''the rules of a profession or institution.'' 
 Both purposes serve as bookends for enhancing the quality of our lives, nationally and individually. To be effective, one cannot preclude the other.

HEADLINE: Net Income Fell in Quarter for AT&T

BYLINE: By MATT RICHTEL

 BODY:
AT&T, the telecommunications giant, reported on Wednesday that its fourth-quarter profit fell from a year ago but the figures were clouded by changes to the way it accounts for sales of the iPhone. 
 The company said net income for the fourth quarter was $2.4 billion or 41 cents a share, compared to $3.1 billion, or 51 cents a share, in the period a year earlier.
 However, about a nickel of that difference was the up-front fee that AT&T pays for each iPhone it sells, rather than spreading that cost over time. AT&T started to install that accounting change this summer with the release of Apple's latest iPhone model.
 More broadly, AT&T reported mixed financial results for the fourth quarter. The company benefited by continued growth in the wireless business, and faced declines in the landline business.
 Revenue for the fourth quarter was $31.1 billion up slightly from $30.4 billion in the quarter a year ago. 
 Excluding one-time charges, the company had a profit of 64 cents a share. On that basis, a consensus of Wall Street analysts had projected the company would earn 65 cents a share. 
 For the year, the company earned $12.9 billion, or $2.16 a share, up from $11.95 billion, or $1.94 a share, for 2007. Revenue rose 4.3 percent to $124 billion.
 In the wireless side of its business, AT&T said it added 2.1 million subscribers in the quarter, compared with 2.7 million in the quarter a year ago, a drop in part attributable to the fact that most Americans already have phones and service plans.
 But AT&T saw the revenue that it earned from each subscriber grow to $59.59, up from $57.35 a year ago. The growth came largely from increasing use of data.
 On the landline side of the business, the company lost 1.56 million access lines in the fourth quarter and 6 million overall in 2008. Those figures are consistent with long-term trends as consumers and business move away from landlines and toward wireless products and services.
 AT&T continued to see increased growth of its U-verse television service, which gained 264,000 subscribers in the fourth quarter compared with an increase of 105,000 a year ago. The company gained 236,000 broadband customers in the fourth quarter, down from 396,000 a year ago -- a fall that is in part attributable to the challenging economy.
 Ed Snyder, an industry analyst with Charter Equity Research, said the performance was more-or-less inline with Wall Street's expectations.
 ''The wireline business was weak but the wireless business was a little better than expected,'' he said. ''No big surprises.''

HEADLINE: 2 Carmakers Are Closing Jobs Banks

BYLINE: By NICK BUNKLEY

DATELINE: DETROIT 

 BODY:
The era when factory workers who lost their jobs could still collect nearly their full salary will be over by next week at General Motors and Chrysler, which have borrowed billions of dollars from the federal government to avoid bankruptcy. 
 G.M. said on Wednesday that it would end its jobs bank, a program often held up by critics as a symbol of Detroit's inefficiency, as of next Monday. Chrysler ended its jobs bank last Monday.
 The United Automobile Workers union agreed to let the carmakers terminate the programs as one of several concessions offered by its leadership to help win support for the so-called bridge loans. The union also said it would delay required payments into a new retiree health care trust and has begun talks with the companies about other ways to cut costs in its labor agreements.
 G.M. said about 1,600 of its workers are currently in the jobs bank. They will officially be laid off and begin collecting about 72 percent of their full-time pay, through a combination of state unemployment benefits and supplemental benefits from G.M.
 ''This was a valuable tool to have a work force standing by that was familiar with how to work in a factory environment,'' a G.M. spokesman, Tony Sapienza, said Wednesday. ''Unfortunately that business model wasn't sustainable over the long term.''
 The carmakers agreed to create their jobs banks in the 1980s, when the union demanded protection for workers whose jobs might otherwise have been lost to productivity improvements.
 The Ford Motor Company, which has not borrowed money from the government, has not announced changes to its jobs bank. 
 A Ford spokeswoman, Angie Kozleski, said the company had been in discussions with the U.A.W. but she would not divulge whether the jobs bank is among the issues on the table.

 BODY:
What's not to like about a private jet? These days, plenty.
 After enjoying a long run as an enviable perk of corporate America -- justified to shareholders as time- and money-savers for globe-trotting executives -- they are rapidly becoming symbols of high-flying excess. 
 Congress, in particular, is frowning upon companies that ask for taxpayer bailouts while still enjoying the comfort of their private planes or placing orders for a new one. 
 Detroit automakers learned that lesson late last year, and announced they would sell their fleets after being questioned in Congressional hearings. Now Citigroup has said it would not take delivery of a $42 million Dassault Falcon 7X jet that it had planned to buy. 
 ''It's getting to be a black eye to own a corporate jet,'' said Paul Nisbet, an aviation analyst with JSA Research. With so many companies deciding to sell their planes -- both for cost-cutting reasons and to avoid public relations headaches -- the used-jet market is being flooded with inventory, and the prices of private jets are falling faster than the value of McMansions. On Wednesday, Starbucks said it would sell two of its three corporate jets, a Gulfstream 550 and a Gulfstream V, to save money. 
 ''A year ago, there would be 30 people looking for one airplane,'' said Jay Mesinger, a corporate jet broker, who said that prices had fallen 30 to 40 percent since late 2007. ''Today there are 30 airplanes looking for one buyer.''
 With the economy continuing to sour, more airplanes will most likely be chasing even fewer buyers. 
 ''After the automakers came to Washington and after the Citibank silliness, there's been a rush to get out of these airplanes,'' said Clark Onstad, president of Solutions 4 VIP, a Denver company that outfits large corporate jets. ''Price is not an issue. They are selling for image purposes, and the operation of a jet is a small overall cost in relation to a company's image. So they are saying, 'dump.' '' 
 Manufacturers are hurting. This month Cessna, maker of the popular Cessna Citation, said it would lay off an additional 2,000 workers -- its second round of cuts -- and that the company would probably shrink production in 2009. Last week, employees at Hawker Beechcraft, another corporate jet maker, were told to prepare for another round of layoffs after 500 job cuts last December. Business at Cessna, which had been anticipating an upturn in orders in 2009, had a steep decline in the third quarter of 2008. 
 ''Very recently this market has taken an extreme turn down,'' with customers worldwide canceling orders and delaying deliveries, Douglas Oliver, a Cessna spokesman, said Wednesday. ''We are looking at a brave new world compared to three months ago.'' 
 The trade association for the corporate jet business said that its members were being unfairly maligned. ''We are concerned that actions in Washington are disparaging and discouraging of general aviation being used for business purposes,'' said Ed Bolen, president of the National Business Aviation Association. 
 When the global economy was surging, airplanes commanded a premium above sticker price, and manufacturers enjoyed a three- to five-year backlog. Given that shortage, buyers were even paying new plane prices for a used jet because they did not want to wait. 
 In the current depressed market, Mr. Mesinger said that Citigroup could pick up a used 2003 Bombardier Global Express XRS -- which, like the Dassault Falcon, seats 12 to 14 people and has trans-Atlantic capability -- for about $30 million. That same 2003 plane would have sold for $48 million in late 2007.
 Another plane that can accommodate about the same number of travelers is the Gulfstream V. A 2003 model would have sold for $42 million to $44 million during the boom. Today a seller would be lucky to fetch a price of $25 million or so, brokers said. 
 The pool of potential buyers is also drying up because of the difficulty in obtaining credit. 
 ''Until the banks start financing, the amount of planes on the market will continue to grow,'' said Richard Santulli, chief executive of Netjets, a private jet company owned by Berkshire Hathaway. When credit eases, he added, ''the market will open up because interest rates are so low.''
 Mr. Nisbet of JSA Research said that the makers of smaller corporate jets were hurting more than companies selling bigger jets. 
 Indeed, General Dynamics, the parent company of Gulfstream, reported higher fourth-quarter profits Wednesday at Gulfstream as a result of strong 2008 sales. 
 The plane maker's fourth-quarter profits rose 25 percent, to $264 million. It expects to deliver 124 planes in 2009, down from 156. But this drop will be offset by the fact that more of them will be bigger, high-end models. The company has a backlog of 246 orders for the next two and a half years. 
 These bigger jets, Mr. Nisbet said, ''are often bought by billionaires who can dole out $55 million for a plane and fly it off.''

HEADLINE: Financials Rally on Hopes for 'Bad Bank'

BYLINE: By JACK HEALY

 BODY:
For one day, at least, battered bank stocks actually helped the markets.
Reports that the government was considering a deal to set up a ''bad bank'' to absorb toxic assets ignited a broad rally on Wednesday, with financial companies leading the way. It was Wall Street's third consecutive day of gains, which reached across all sectors.
The Obama administration did not announce formal plans to absorb billions of dollars in toxic assets still lingering on the balance sheets of banks. But the Treasury secretary, Timothy F. Geithner, has confirmed that officials were considering such a system, to be run by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. 
''Investors are concluding that if the F.D.I.C. is going to run the bad bank and take on all the bad assets of the commercial banking system, then they will suddenly be transformed overnight into good banks,'' said Ed Yardeni, president of Yardeni Research, who added, ''which is a bit of a stretch.''
Stocks rose to their highest point in two weeks, injecting a note of cheer into markets that have been stricken by new fears about the scope of the economic downturn.
The Dow Jones industrial average rose 200.72 points, or 2.46 percent, to 8,375.45, while the broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index jumped 28.38 points, or 3.36 percent, to 874.09. The technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index increased 53.44 points, or 3.55 percent, to 1,558.34.
Once again, investors watched developments in Washington as the House prepared to vote on an $825 billion stimulus plan that contains a combination of tax cuts and new spending.
And a statement released by the Federal Open Market Committee indicated that interest rates would stay near zero in the face of the persistent recession. The Fed indicated it was growing more concerned about deflation and the health of the economy and said it was willing to expand programs to buy mortgage-backed securities, which are aimed at unfreezing the credit markets.
''The Federal Reserve will employ all available tools to promote the resumption of sustainable economic growth and to preserve price stability,'' the committee said in a statement.
Wells Fargo posted a fourth-quarter loss of $2.55 billion, its profit hurt by mortgage assets that it assumed after it took over Wachovia. But the results were better than some analysts had expected, sending the stock up $5, or 30.88 percent, to $21.19.
Financial companies including Citigroup, Bank of America, Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan Chase rose by double digits. Citigroup gained 66 cents, or 18.59 percent, to $4.21. Bank of America jumped 89 cents, or 13.69 percent, to $7.39. Morgan Stanley rose $3.48, or 17.83 percent, to $23. JPMorgan jumped $2.60, or 10.38 percent, to $27.66.
Shares of banks and brokerage firms were pummeled in 2008 as the credit crisis unfolded and troubles in mortgage-backed assets came to light.
''I would not be backing up the truck to financial stocks just yet,'' said Stephanie Giroux, chief investment strategist at TD Ameritrade.
And analysts said that the gains in financial shares could quickly evaporate.
''A lot of these bank stocks are getting awfully close to zero,'' Mr. Yardeni said. ''I don't think you're seeing buyers. I think you're seeing short-covering.''
Treasury prices fell as the Fed provided little new guidance on whether it would buy government debt to keep borrowing costs low as the government embarks on broad new deficit spending. The Fed said it was ''prepared'' to buy longer-term Treasuries if such an action would be ''particularly effective'' in aiding the credit markets.
The Treasury's 10-year note fell 1 9/32, to 109 9/32. The yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 2.67 percent, from 2.53 percent late Tuesday.

HEADLINE: Klein Implores Legislators To Reduce Cuts to Schools

BYLINE: By ELISSA GOOTMAN

DATELINE: ALBANY 

 BODY:
Joel I. Klein, the New York City schools chancellor, pleaded with state lawmakers on Wednesday to reduce proposed budget cuts and to give the city more flexibility in how state aid is spent, saying that as things stand, the schools could have to lay off 15,000 employees, many of them teachers, next year. 
 Testifying at a joint hearing of the Assembly Ways and Means Committee and the Senate Finance Committee, the chancellor said the school system now faces a $1.4 billion shortfall from its 2009-10 budget: $700 million in state cuts, $500 million in city cuts and $200 million in what he described as increases in ''additional obligations,'' including salary increases and special-education mandates. 
 The chancellor implored lawmakers to reconsider a proposed $84 million cut from the current school year's budget, saying the move could ''really wreak havoc.'' And while a stimulus package from the federal government could ''ameliorate'' the school system's budget crunch, he said, it would not eliminate the problem. 
 But his most controversial request was for greater flexibility in how the city and its 1,499 schools can spend new state money mandated by a court order after a long-running lawsuit. The Legislature has required that some of that money be spent on certain efforts, like reducing class sizes, and in particularly needy schools. 
 ''You've got to give our schools more flexibility,'' Mr. Klein said. ''If you try to constrict it and say, 'You've got to spend it on new programs, not cover old programs,' were going to create more problems.'' 
 Mr. Klein warned that without such flexibility, many schools serving middle-class children could suffer disproportionally.
 ''When you're talking about a growth time, giving more money to high-poverty, high-needs schools is a good strategy, and I've supported that,'' he said. ''But in a cut time, you want the cuts to be equitable. I want to be responsible to all 1.1 million kids and their parents.'' 
 Billy Easton, executive director of the Alliance for Quality Education, an advocacy group, said he hoped that lawmakers refused the chancellor's request to give the school system more spending flexibility. 
 ''The greater needs of needier kids don't change with the economy,'' he said. 
 ''To say that a bad economy is a reason not to do more for the highest-needs kids, it just doesn't make any sense.'' 
 Last spring, legislators balked when Mr. Klein made a similar plea for greater freedom on how to spend certain portions of state aid. 
 If legislators were receptive to Mr. Klein's entreaties on Wednesday, they did not indicate it. Several questioned the chancellor on how budget cuts would affect class sizes, an issue that many parents are passionate about but that the Bloomberg administration has not made a priority, and raised what is poised to be a hot topic in Albany in the months to come: the fate of a 2002 law, which expires at the end of June, giving New York City's mayor control of its schools. 
 Assemblyman Herman D. Farrell Jr., chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, said he was troubled that under mayoral control, parents had little say in policy decisions, a situation he described as ''a silencing of the lambs.'' Mr. Farrell also said the chancellor and Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg were too closely aligned. ''You've got to have tension'' between the two positions, he said. Mr. Farrell, a Manhattan Democrat, suggested a new position, which he described as ''subchancellor or superchancellor or uberchancellor,'' to ensure two distinct voices.

HEADLINE: Congressional Quarterly Is for Sale

BYLINE: By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA

 BODY:
The owner of The St. Petersburg Times put its Congressional Quarterly subsidiary up for sale on Wednesday, trying to separate the most profitable part of the business from the more troubled flagship newspaper. 
 Executives of the parent company, the Times Publishing Company, said that with the financial crisis in the newspaper business hitting Florida markets especially hard, it no longer had the resources to keep expanding Congressional Quarterly Inc. A sale would also generate cash to help shore up The St. Petersburg Times newspaper.
''Right now, the newspaper's not as successful as it once was, and CQ deserves an owner that can help grow it,'' said Paul C. Tash, editor of The St. Petersburg Times, and chairman and chief executive of Times Publishing. The company is wholly owned by the Poynter Institute, a nonprofit foundation for journalism education.
 Times Publishing does not make its financial performance public, but executives said the Congressional Quarterly was consistently profitable and had double-digit annual revenue growth in recent years. (The subsidiary's name is misleading; it encompasses several online and print news sources, and none of them is quarterly.) They would not say whether the St. Petersburg Times turns a profit.
 The Poynter Institute operated at a $2.1 million loss in 2007, on $7.7 million in revenue, according to its most recent public filing with the I.R.S.
 The recession and the credit squeeze have depressed asset prices, but executives of Times Publishing say they regularly receive calls from people interested in buying the Congressional Quarterly. The company has hired the Jordan, Edmiston Group, an investment banking firm specializing in media sales.
 Congressional Quarterly serves a small but lucrative audience that needs to track events on Capitol Hill, from broad strokes to minute detail -- primarily government employees, lobbyists, leaders of interest groups and the advertisers who want to reach them. It is an increasingly crowded niche, with the National Journal, Roll Call, The Hill and Politico covering similar ground.
 ''It's become a very dynamic, vibrant, even brutal marketplace,'' said Robert W. Merry, president and editor in chief of Congressional Quarterly.
 The company's biggest revenue source is CQ.com, an online subscription service with more than 20,000 users who pay for access to dozens of databases, including Congressional votes, the progress of specific bills and archives of the company's publications.
 It publishes CQ Weekly, a magazine with a paid circulation of more than 14,000, and CQ Today, a newsletter published daily when Congress is in session, with paid circulation of almost 11,000. It also produces Governing magazine, distributed free to about 85,000 state and local government officials around the country.

HEADLINE: What Red Ink? Wall St. Paid Hefty Bonuses

BYLINE: By BEN WHITE; Paul J. Sullivan contributed reporting.

 BODY:
By almost any measure, 2008 was a complete disaster for Wall Street -- except, that is, when the bonuses arrived.
 Despite crippling losses, multibillion-dollar bailouts and the passing of some of the most prominent names in the business, employees at financial companies in New York, the now-diminished world capital of capital, collected an estimated $18.4 billion in bonuses for the year. 
 That was the sixth-largest haul on record, according to a report released Wednesday by the New York State comptroller. 
 While the payouts paled next to the riches of recent years, Wall Street workers still took home about as much as they did in 2004, when the Dow Jones industrial average was flying above 10,000, on its way to a record high. 
 Some bankers took home millions last year even as their employers lost billions. 
 The comptroller's estimate, a closely watched guidepost of the annual December-January bonus season, is based largely on personal income tax collections. It excludes stock option awards that could push the figures even higher. 
 The state comptroller, Thomas P. DiNapoli, said it was unclear if banks had used taxpayer money for the bonuses, a possibility that strikes corporate governance experts, and indeed many ordinary Americans, as outrageous. He urged the Obama administration to examine the issue closely.
 ''The issue of transparency is a significant one, and there needs to be an accounting about whether there was any taxpayer money used to pay bonuses or to pay for corporate jets or dividends or anything else,'' Mr. DiNapoli said in an interview. 
 Granted, New York's bankers and brokers are far poorer than they were in 2006, when record deals, and the record profits they generated, ushered in an era of Wall Street hyperwealth. All told, bonuses fell 44 percent last year, from $32.9 billion in 2007, the largest decline in dollar terms on record. 
 But the size of that downturn partly reflected the lofty heights to which bonuses had soared during the bull market. At many banks, those payouts were based on profits that turned out to be ephemeral. Throughout the financial industry, years of earnings have vanished in the flames of the credit crisis. 
 According to Mr. DiNapoli, the brokerage units of New York financial companies lost more than $35 billion in 2008, triple their losses in 2007. The pain is unlikely to end there, and Wall Street is betting that the Obama administration will move swiftly to buy some of banks' troubled assets to encourage reluctant banks to make loans. 
 Many corporate governance experts, investors and lawmakers question why financial companies that have accepted taxpayer money paid any bonuses at all. Financial industry executives argue that they need to pay their best workers well in order to keep them, but with many banks cutting jobs, job options are dwindling, even for stars. 
 Lucian A. Bebchuk, a professor at Harvard Law School and expert on executive compensation, called the 2008 bonus figure ''disconcerting.'' Bonuses, he said, are meant to reward good performance and retain employees. But Wall Street disbursed billions despite staggering losses and a shrinking job market. 
 ''This was neither the sixth-best year in terms of aggregate profits, nor was it the sixth-most-difficult year in terms of retaining employees,'' Professor Bebchuk said. 
 Echoing Mr. DiNapoli, Professor Bebchuk said he was concerned that banks might be using taxpayer money to subsidize bonuses or dividends to stockholders. ''What the government has been trying to do is shore up capital, and any diversion of capital out of banks, whether in the form of dividends or large payments to employees, really undermines what we are trying to do,'' he said. 
 Jesse M. Brill, a lawyer and expert on executive compensation, said government bailout programs like the Troubled Asset Relief Program, or TARP, should be made more transparent. 
 ''We are all flying in the dark,'' Mr. Brill said. ''Companies can simply say they are trying to do their best to comply with compensation limits without providing any of the details that the public is entitled to.''
 Bonuses paid by one troubled Wall Street firm, Merrill Lynch, have come under particular scrutiny during the last week. 
 Andrew M. Cuomo, the New York attorney general, has issued subpoenas to John A. Thain, Merrill's former chief executive, and to an executive at Bank of America, which recently acquired Merrill, asking for information about Merrill's decision to pay $4 billion to $5 billion in bonuses despite new, gaping losses that forced Bank of America to seek a second financial lifeline from Washington. 
 A Treasury Department official said that in the coming weeks, the department would take action to further ensure taxpayer money is not used to pay bonuses. 
 Even though Wall Street spent billions on bonuses, New York firms squeezed rank-and-file executives harder than many companies in other fields. Outside the financial industry, many corporate executives received fatter bonuses in 2008, even as the economy lost 2.6 million jobs. According to data from Equilar, a compensation research firm, the average performance-based bonuses for top executives, other than the chief executive, at 132 companies with revenues of more than $1 billion increased by 14 percent, to $265,594, in the 2008 fiscal year. 
 For New York State and New York City, however, the leaner times on Wall Street will hurt, Mr. DiNapoli said. 
 Mr. DiNapoli said the average Wall Street bonus declined 36.7 percent, to $112,000. That is smaller than the overall 44 percent decline because the money was spread among a smaller pool following thousands of job losses. 
 The comptroller said the reduction in bonuses would cost New York State nearly $1 billion in income tax revenue and cost New York City $275 million. 
 On Wall Street, where money is the ultimate measure, some employees apparently feel slighted by their diminished bonuses. A poll of 900 financial industry employees released on Wednesday by eFinancialCareers.com, a job search Web site, found that while nearly eight out of 10 got bonuses, 46 percent thought they deserved more.

HEADLINE: From the Top, the White House Loosens Its Buttoned-Up Style

BYLINE: By SHERYL GAY STOLBERG

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
The capital flew into a bit of a tizzy when, on his first full day in the White House, President Obama was photographed in the Oval Office without his suit jacket. There was, however, a logical explanation: Mr. Obama, who hates the cold, had cranked up the thermostat.
 ''He's from Hawaii, O.K.?'' said Mr. Obama's senior adviser, David Axelrod, who occupies the small but strategically located office next door to his boss. ''He likes it warm. You could grow orchids in there.''
 Thus did a rule of the George W. Bush administration -- coat and tie in the Oval Office at all times -- fall by the wayside, only the first of many signs that a more informal culture is growing up in the White House under new management. Mr. Obama promised to bring change to Washington and he has -- not just in substance, but in presidential style. 
 Although his presidency is barely a week old, some of Mr. Obama's work habits are already becoming clear. He shows up at the Oval Office shortly before 9 in the morning, roughly two hours later than his early-to-bed, early-to-rise predecessor. Mr. Obama likes to have his workout -- weights and cardio -- first thing in the morning, at 6:45. (Mr. Bush slipped away to exercise midday.) 
 He reads several papers, eats breakfast with his family and helps pack his daughters, Malia, 10, and Sasha, 7, off to school before making the 30-second commute downstairs -- a definite perk for a man trying to balance work and family life. He eats dinner with his family, then often returns to work; aides have seen him in the Oval Office as late as 10 p.m., reading briefing papers for the next day.
 ''Even as he is sober about these challenges, I have never seen him happier,'' Mr. Axelrod said. ''The chance to be under the same roof with his kids, essentially to live over the store, to be able to see them whenever he wants, to wake up with them, have breakfast and dinner with them -- that has made him a very happy man.''
 In the West Wing, Mr. Obama is a bit of a wanderer. When Mr. Bush wanted to see a member of his staff, the aide was summoned to the Oval Office. But Mr. Obama tends to roam the halls; one day last week, he turned up in the office of his press secretary, Robert Gibbs, who was in the unfortunate position of having his feet up on the desk when the boss walked in. 
 ''Wow, Gibbs,'' the press secretary recalls the president saying. ''Just got here and you already have your feet up.'' Mr. Gibbs scrambled to stand up, surprising Mr. Obama, who is not yet accustomed to having people rise when he enters a room. 
 Under Mr. Bush, punctuality was a virtue. Meetings started early -- the former president once locked Secretary of State Colin L. Powell out of the Cabinet Room when Mr. Powell showed up a few minutes late -- and ended on time. In the Obama White House, meetings start on time and often finish late. 
 When the president invited Congressional leaders to 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue last week to talk about his economic stimulus package, the session ran so long that Mr. Obama wound up apologizing to the lawmakers -- even as he kept them talking, engaging them in the details of the legislation far more than was customary for Mr. Bush.
 ''He was concerned that he was keeping us,'' said Representative Eric Cantor of Virginia, the Republican whip. ''He said, 'I know we need to get you all out of here at a certain time.' But we continued the discussion. What are you going to say? It's the president.'' 
 If Mr. Obama's clock is looser than Mr. Bush's, so too are his sartorial standards. Over the weekend, Mr. Obama's first in office, his aides did not quite know how to dress. Some showed up in jeans (another no-no under Mr. Bush), some in coats and ties. 
 So the president issued an informal edict for ''business casual'' on weekends -- and set his own example. He showed up Saturday for a briefing with his chief economic adviser, Lawrence H. Summers, dressed in slacks and a gray sweater over a white buttoned-down shirt. Veterans of the Bush White House are shocked.
 ''I'll never forget going to work on a Saturday morning, getting called down to the Oval Office because there was something he was mad about,'' said Dan Bartlett, who was counselor to Mr. Bush. ''I had on khakis and a buttoned-down shirt, and I had to stand by the door and get chewed out for about 15 minutes. He wouldn't even let me cross the threshold.''
 Mr. Obama has also brought a more relaxed sensibility to his public appearances. David Gergen, an adviser to both Republican and Democratic presidents, said Mr. Obama seemed to exude an ''Aloha Zen,'' a kind of comfortable calm that, Mr. Gergen said, reflects a man who ''seems easygoing, not so full of himself.''
 At the Capitol on Tuesday, Mr. Obama startled lawmakers by walking up to the microphones in a Senate corridor to talk to reporters, as if he were still a senator. Twice, during formal White House ceremonies, Mr. Obama called out to aides as television cameras rolled, as he did on Monday when the director of the Environmental Protection Agency, Lisa P. Jackson, asked for a presidential pen.
 ''Hey, Lisa,'' Mr. Obama called out to his staff secretary, Lisa Brown, ''does she get this pen?''
 Mr. Obama's daily schedule seems flexible. Mr. Bush began each day, Monday through Saturday, with a top-secret intelligence briefing on security threats against the United States. Mr. Obama gets the ''president's daily brief'' on Sundays as well, though unlike his predecessor, he does not necessarily put it first on his agenda.
 Sometimes Mr. Obama's economic briefing, a new addition to the presidential schedule, comes first. Its attendees vary depending on the day, aides said. On Tuesday, the newly sworn-in Treasury secretary, Timothy F. Geithner, joined Mr. Summers to talk about financial and credit markets. On Wednesday, Paul A. Volcker, the former chairman of the Federal Reserve and informal Obama adviser, was on hand to discuss regulatory reform.
 Mr. Obama has also maintained the longstanding presidential tradition of weekly lunches with his vice president. For Mr. Obama, lunch generally means a cheeseburger, chicken or fish in his small dining room off the Oval Office. There is also a new addition to White House cuisine: the refrigerators are stocked with the president's favorite organic brew, Honest Tea, in Mr. Obama's preferred flavors of Black Forest Berry and Green Dragon.
 If there is one thing Mr. Obama has not gotten around to changing, it is the Oval Office decor. 
 When Mr. Bush moved in, he exercised his presidential decorating prerogatives and asked his wife, Laura, to supervise the design of a new rug. Mr. Bush loved to regale visitors with the story of the rug, whose sunburst design, he liked to say, was intended to evoke a feeling of optimism.
 The rug is still there, as are the presidential portraits Mr. Bush selected -- one of Washington, one of Lincoln -- and a collection of decorative green and white plates. During a meeting last week with retired military officials, before he signed an executive order shutting down the prison at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, Mr. Obama surveyed his new environs with a critical eye.
 ''He looked around,'' said one of his guests, retired Rear Adm. John D. Hutson, ''and said, 'I've got to do something about these plates. I'm not really a plates kind of guy.' ''

HEADLINE: Following the Money

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
At first, it will trickle into paychecks in small, barely perceptible amounts: perhaps $12 or $13 a week for many American workers, in the form of lower tax withholding.
 For the growing ranks of the unemployed, it will be more noticeable: benefit checks due to stop will keep coming, along with an extra $25 a week. 
 At the grocery store, a family of four on food stamps could find up to $79 more a month on their government-issued debit card. 
 And far bigger sums will appear, courtesy of Washington, on budget ledgers in state capitals nationwide: billions of dollars for health care, schools and public works. 
 There is no doubt that the impact of the $819 billion economic stimulus package advanced by President Obama and approved by the House on Wednesday will start to be felt within weeks once the final version becomes law. 
 But estimating how effective the huge program of tax cuts and spending will be in getting America's economic engines humming again is a far more complex calculation requiring almost line-by-line scrutiny of the 647-page bill, lawmakers, economists and policy analysts say. 
 While it may be difficult to predict how well the overall plan will work, it is easier to draw conclusions about its individual components, gauging them against the basic goal of any stimulus: to promote economic activity and create jobs as quickly and efficiently as possible. 
 Devising any economic stimulus plan is tricky: initiatives that can be carried out relatively fast, like tax cuts, tend to provide less bang for the buck in terms of generating jobs and economic growth, while initiatives likely to spur more robust activity, like public works projects, can take so long to get under way that they arrive too late. 
 Tax Cuts
 The provisions intended to have the swiftest impact are the tax cuts, totaling $275 billion, roughly a third of the package.
 Republicans say the cuts are too small, some Democrats say they were ill designed in a vain effort to appease House Republicans, and some economists say both sides are right: that the plan should include more effective tax cuts and more of them, and also address specific problems like the weak housing market. 
 Mr. Obama's signature tax cut would provide a credit of up to $500 for individuals and $1,000 for couples. It won praise in an analysis by the Tax Policy Center, a nonpartisan research group, because it could be carried out quickly, by reducing the amount of money withheld from paychecks.
 But the same group also criticized it because it would help families earning as much as $150,000 a year, who are more likely to save than spend. (Saving, or paying off debt, might make sense for individual households, but what the economy needs most is for people to spend money, helping stores to sell more, factories to produce more and employers to avoid cutting additional jobs.) 
 Some experts say adjusting withholding rates could prove complicated, delaying the money. But the White House says the plan would work even better than a lump-sum rebate; some research suggests that rebate checks are more likely to be saved than tax reductions spread out over a length of time.
 Even some economists who generally support the stimulus think that the main tax proposal would provide limited economic lift.
 ''People are going to spend 30, 40 cents on the dollar, so the multiplier is going to be low,'' said Adam S. Posen, deputy director of the Peterson Institute of International Economics.
 Aid to States
 One area where analysts say the bill would be relatively effective is in providing assistance to states, many of which, to comply with balanced-budget requirements, are facing the prospect of steep cuts in jobs and services. Aid to states does not expand economic activity, but it helps prevent cuts that would make the downturn even worse. 
 An $87 billion provision increasing the federal contribution for Medicaid costs is expected to go a long way to help states close their budget gaps. 
 But there has been little discussion so far on a proposal by the Senate Republican leader, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, that aid to states be provided in the form of loans, encouraging them to spend the money wisely and, once the economy rebounds, obligating them to help reduce the national debt. 
 The bill would also create a $79 billion state fiscal stabilization fund, disbursing half the money in late 2009 and half in late 2010. The Congressional Budget Office has estimated that little of that money would be spent this year.
 Infrastructure
 The greatest prospect of delay in spending is on infrastructure. The bill provides $30 billion for highway construction and tens of billions more for other transportation projects, water projects, park renovation, military construction, local housing projects and more. 
 A Congressional Budget Office analysis found that only 64 percent of the bill's spending would be completed within 19 months, and spending on construction projects was among the slowest.
 If the economic recovery is slow, that timing could work out perfectly, giving the economy a jolt just when faster-acting components are wearing off. But if there is a quicker-than-expected rebound, many of those projects could start just in time to compete with renewed private spending. 
 Then there is the risk that the projects themselves have little or no long-term economic value and simply drive up the budget deficit. Democrats bowed to Republican pressure on Tuesday and stripped from the bill a $200 million provision for National Mall restorations.
 Education, Health Care
 And Alternative Energy
 A look at more than $140 billion in the bill's spending on education finds some that can move quickly -- for instance, $13 billion each over two years for Title I schools, which serve impoverished students, and for special education under the Individuals With Disabilities Education Act.
 But also included are programs that even under the most optimistic timetable will take longer to complete, like $20 billion for school renovations. These would provide little near-term help for the economy. 
 Similar scrutiny could be trained on health care and especially on alternative energy programs. Like some of the education spending, a large chunk of health care spending would not start until 2012 or later, when, most experts think, the recession will be over. 
 Automatic Stabilizers
 Unemployment benefits and food stamps are such useful stimulus tools that budget analysts refer to them as ''automatic stabilizers.'' 
 They are built into the system, allowing money to flow quickly to people who need it and are likely to spend it.
 The House bill would spend $20 billion over five years on added food stamps. If the recovery legislation is adopted by mid-February, officials say, the first added food stamps will be delivered in April and nearly all of that aid used that month.
 The legislation would also devote roughly $43 billion over two years to extend and increase unemployment benefits. The provision would add as much as 33 weeks of benefits, for states with the highest unemployment rates.

HEADLINE: In Davos, Russia and China Blame Capitalists for Crisis

BYLINE: By CARTER DOUGHERTY and KATRIN BENNHOLD

DATELINE: DAVOS, Switzerland 

 BODY:
The leaders of the former bastions of the Communist bloc took the stage here on Wednesday to rebuke their capitalist brothers for dragging the world into crisis but also to assure them that, working together, they can rapidly restore the global economy to health.
 In the official opening address of the World Economic Forum, Prime Minister Vladimir V. Putin of Russia spoke of a financial ''perfect storm'' that has decimated the old system, rendering it obsolete. 
 ''A year ago, American delegates speaking from this rostrum emphasized the U.S. economy's fundamental stability and its cloudless prospects,'' he said, speaking through a translator. ''Today, investment banks, the pride of Wall Street, have virtually ceased to exist.''
 But the damage goes beyond Wall Street, he said. ''The entire economic growth system, where one regional center prints money without respite and consumes material wealth, while another regional center manufactures inexpensive goods and saves money printed by other governments, has suffered a major setback.'' 
 The Chinese premier, Wen Jiabao, left little doubt that Beijing blamed the United States for the economic breakdown. ''Inappropriate macroeconomic policies,'' an ''unsustainable model of development characterized by prolonged low savings and high consumption,'' the ''blind pursuit of profit'' and ''the failure of financial supervision'' all contributed, he said.
 Like Mr. Putin, he was upbeat about prospects for the future and expressed an eagerness to work with the West on solving common economic problems.
 Mr. Wen was eager to assure investors that China was poised to rebound. ''I can give you a definitive answer,'' he said of the prospect that his economy would recover strongly. ''Yes, it will; we are full of confidence.''
 He said that the Chinese government had set a goal of 8 percent growth this year, which he called ''an attainable target through hard work.'' He reeled off statistics showing that bank lending and investment, after slowing sharply in the fall, picked up in December and January.
 ''The harsh winter will be gone and spring is around the corner,'' Mr. Wen said.
 In his 30-minute speech, Mr. Putin portrayed Russia as a reliable partner in energy, trade and politics despite the economic crisis, which has dragged down Russia's growth rates and drastically reduced its revenue from oil, a major export. ''We can't afford being isolationist or economically selfish,'' he said, adding, ''We are all in the same boat.''
 As recently as December, Mr. Putin had harsh words for the United States. On Wednesday, he struck a more conciliatory note, saying he would not dwell on who was responsible and talking instead about ''mutual interests'' and ''mutual dependencies.''
 ''We hope that our partners in Europe, Asia and America -- and I'm also addressing the new administration, we wish them well -- I hope they will be willing to cooperate constructively,'' he said.
 Some Russians in attendance here said Moscow's dependence on Western investors -- Russia's stock market is down more than 70 percent from its peak, for example -- might have played a role in Mr. Putin's adopting a less combative stance.
 Mr. Wen admitted that the Chinese were feeling the ill effects of the economic downturn. ''We are facing severe challenges, including notably shrinking external demand, overcapacity in some sectors, difficult business conditions for enterprises, rising unemployment in urban areas and greater downward pressure on economic growth,'' he said.
 Given the outlook for the year, financial experts said, the leaders' choice of accommodation over recrimination was probably a wise course.
 ''We cannot underestimate the challenges and dangers that the world economy faces in 2009,'' Stephen S. Roach, chairman of Morgan Stanley Asia, said at the forum's traditional opening debate on the macroeconomic outlook. ''It will most likely be the first year since World War II when G.D.P. actually contracts.''
 Mr. Roach cast doubt on some of Mr. Wen's sunny pronouncements about China's economy and noted that shipments from Taiwan and Japan were also down. ''As the Chinese economy has hit a wall, the rest of Asia has followed suit,'' he added.
 Echoing a widely held view in the global business community, Heizo Takenaka, director of the Global Security Research Institute at Keio University in Japan, said fear had taken over as the main driver of the crisis.
 ''The current situation is something more than a financial and economic crisis,'' Mr. Takenaka said. ''We face a confidence crisis'' requiring a strong government and central banks.
 The most panicky of all, Mr. Roach said, are American consumers, who are retrenching after a decade-long binge fed by inflated housing prices. He predicted that they were only ''20 percent into a multiyear'' adjustment that would leave them much more frugal.

A CALMER, SAFER BASRA
Offers an Opportunity for Women
Prompted by improved security conditions, thousands of women in Basra are running for council seats in the provincial government. But even with so many hurdles crossed, there are still more if they get elected. Page A5 
POPE REACTS TO ANGER OVER BISHOP
Pope Benedict XVI was quick to avow his feelings of solidarity with Jews and to once more condemn denial of the Holocaust. But tensions have not abated after his decision to welcome back to the church a bishop who said recently that he believed no more than 300,000 Jews died during World War II. Page A5
IRAN'S LEADER SEEKS U.S. APOLOGY
President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad of Iran asked for the United States to apologize for its treatment of Iran over the past 60 years. The request came after President Obama said that there was room for progress in dealing with Iran. Page A6
CHINA DETAINS 81 IN SWEEP
China arrested 81 people during a security sweep of Tibet in the weeks leading up to the 50th anniversary of the region's failed uprising that forced the Dalai Lama into exile, according to state media. Page A6
RAGE OVER IRELAND PAYMENT PLAN
A plan for reconciliation for Northern Ireland provoked outrage on both sides of the conflict. A central article of the plan is payments of $16,800 to the families of each of the 3,700 people killed during 30 years of violence. Much of the anger over the plan came from a provision to extend those payments to members of paramilitary groups killed by their own bombs. Page A10

What Does Shock Rock Have In Common With Switzerland?
It seems odd that this staid, sleepy village in Switzerland would produce a drink so loved by the shock rocker Marilyn Manson. But Mr. Manson's love of this beverage dovetails nicely with this village's specialty, the production of absinthe. So nicely, that Mr. Manson himself has sponsored a brand of the drink called ''Mansinthe.'' Above, a handful of absinthe's key ingredient, wormwood. Page A11

HEADLINE: Chinese Premier Injects Note of Optimism at Davos

BYLINE: By CARTER DOUGHERTY

DATELINE: DAVOS, Switzerland 

 BODY:
At this year's annual meeting of the World Economic Forum, the word ''optimist'' comes across as an ironic joke, with precious few attendees prepared to guess what comes next.
 Gloom is the order of the day.
 ''We cannot underestimate the challenges and dangers that the world economy faces in 2009,'' Stephen Roach, chairman of Morgan Stanley Asia, said at the forum's traditional opening debate on the macroeconomic outlook. ''It will most likely be the first year since World War II when G.D.P. actually contracts.'' 
 The only bright spot, as the conference got under way came from Wen Jiabao, the Chinese premier. Eager to calm concerns that his country's economy would not avoid recession, Mr. Wen struck an unabashedly upbeat tone.
 ''I can give you a definitive answer,'' he said. ''Yes, it will; we are full of confidence.''
 Mr. Wen, in a rare appearance by a top Chinese official at Davos, said that the Chinese government had set a goal of 8 percent growth in 2009, which he called ''an attainable target through hard work.'' He reeled off statistics that showed bank lending and investment, after slowing sharply in the fall, picked up in December and January.
 ''The harsh winter will be gone and spring is around the corner,'' Mr. Wen said.
 Still, the International Monetary Fund, in its new forecasts, sketched the outlines of a very tough winter indeed, economically speaking.
 Global economic growth will reach 0.5 percent this year, the weakest pace since World War II, the monetary fund said. That is down from a 2.2 percent prediction in November.
 The monetary fund also predicted that losses linked to bad mortgage loans in the United States could reach $2.2 trillion, weighing down banks worldwide. That far higher than the $1.4 trillion it anticipated in a November report.
 ''Unless stronger financial strains and uncertainties are forcefully addressed, the pernicious feedback loop between real activity and financial markets will intensify, leading to even more toxic effects on global growth,'' the monetary fund said.
 The picture in individual areas of the world was equally grim, in the monetary fund view. It foresees a 1.6 percent contraction of gross domestic product in the United States this year, and 2.6 percent in Japan. The 16-nation euro area will shrink 2 percent, it said.
 Despite the ambitious goal, Mr. Wen left no doubt that the Chinese were feeling the ill effects of the financial-turned-economic crisis in earnest.
 ''We are facing severe challenges, including notably shrinking external demand, overcapacity in some sectors, difficult business conditions for enterprises, rising unemployment in urban areas and greater downward pressure on economic growth,'' Mr. Wen said.
 For now, though, governments are trying to hold things together with bank bailout schemes and stimulus packages in major economies that dwarf what has ever been tried.
 Mr. Wen touted Chinese 4 trillion yuan stimulus package, equal to about 16 percent of gross domestic product over two years, as a large contribution to domestic demand after years of being the workshop of the world. The plan includes housing projects, rural development, railways and infrastructure, environmental protection, and recovery from last year's devastating earthquakes.
 He said that feasibility studies and other institutional arrangements ensured China would be able to put the plan in place effectively.
 One theme that emerged early, in Davos this year, though, was that the globalization that brought national economies together in times of brisk growth demands that countries hammer out policies together on the downside. Otherwise, new government spending flows across borders, diluting its effects.
 ''We need to have coordinated fiscal response -- stimulus,'' said Justin Yifu Lin, senior vice president and chief economist at the World Bank. They are largely not coordinated.''
 Mr. Wen largely agreed. ''Only with closer cooperation and mutual help can we overcome the crisis,'' he said.
 Trevor Manuel, South Africa's finance minister, cautioned that some fiscal plans may ''come to nought'' until countries figure out how to spend money sensibly.
 ''We see a lemming-like approach: trying to get to the precipice first without having any idea what that money will do,'' Mr. Manuel said.
 ''I think we will have wealthy states indebted without much to show for it.''
 And complaints about how national banking rescue plans are working also emerged.
 ''We feel that governments are encouraging banks to invest only in domestic assets,'' the chairman of the Dogus Group in Turkey, Ferit Sehank, said. ''As an advocate of globalization, I see this as a new way of protectionism.''
 Echoing a widely held view in the global business community, Heizo Takenaka, director of the Global Security Research Institute in Keio, Japan, said fear of the future had taken over as the main driver of the crisis.
 ''The current situation is something more than a financial and economic crisis,'' Mr. Takenaka said. ''We face a confidence crisis. Once the confidence of crisis occurs, we need a strong government and central banks.''
 The panickiest of the lot, Mr. Roach said, are American consumers, who are retrenching after a decade-long binge fed by inflated housing prices, and creating ripple effects -- maybe they are more like tsunamis -- across the world. Mr. Roach predicted that American consumers are only ''20 percent into a multi-year'' adjustment that will leave them much more frugal.
 Chinese exports have already declined quarter-on-quarter, he said.
 Shipments from Taiwan and Japan are also down. ''As the Chinese economy has hit a wall, the rest of Asia has followed suit,'' Mr. Roach said.
 Mr. Manuel, of South Africa, said the economic crisis has hit his continent hard in the past year, as projects to develop natural resources, an area with much potential for Africa, are scaled back.
 In the Democratic Republic of Congo alone, 48 mining projects are in various stages of abandonment, Mr. Manuel said.
 ''Look at Africa,'' he said. ''It's a risk of decoupling, derailment, and abandonment altogether.''
 Mr. Manuel and others said that as Western and Asian governments start borrowing heavily to spend for stimulus packages, they should allocate a portion to poorer countries.

BYLINE: By JOHN FOLEY and JEFFREY GOLDFARB

 BODY:
A war of words is flaring between China and the United States that could leave both sides losers. Tim Geithner, the new Treasury secretary, accused China last week of manipulating its currency. At Davos, Premier Wen Jiabao of China hit back at the profligate habits and lax regulation of ''some countries.'' Both are right. But each side would do better to acknowledge its own mistakes. 
 China's critics say that letting the yuan rise only in small steps distorts trade, makes United States manufacturers uncompetitive and contributes to the trade deficit. That's less of a problem than it used to be: imports from China fell a record $5.7 billion, or 17 percent, in November, according to the latest data, as consumers cut spending. But a weak yuan has made Chinese exports too cheap for too long, even though American consumers have been happy to enjoy the fruits. 
 Washington can't force China to revalue, and there's no sign it's thinking of rash retaliatory measures like import duties. But Mr. Geithner's rhetoric is nonetheless tactless and risks fanning protectionism in Congress. Recent interventionist policies, like loans to carmakers and support for banks, have already compromised the principles of free trade. A creeping halt to global trade could easily turn a recession into a slump. 
 Moreover, calls for China to unhook its currency ignore the co-dependency of the two nations. To maintain its exchange rate, China's central bank buys huge slabs of dollar-denominated assets, so it can match its yuan to the right number of dollars. That means the Treasury doesn't have to juice up yields on its paper to attract other buyers. China is already buying fewer Treasury bonds than it was, but speeding the process would raise the cost of issuing new debt. 
 Ultimately a revaluation of the yuan is likely, maybe as much as 40 percent, by some estimates. It is pie in the sky, of course, to think China will rush into such a shift when growth already lags 8 percent. A rapid change would harm both sides. But in the long run, a stronger currency would help turn China from the world's sweatshop into a stable, consumption-led economy and take away a big driver of United States consumers' profligacy. Both sides should work constructively to achieve that end, and leave the rhetorical swordplay alone.
 The Real Winners
 It's now clear that 2008 Wall Street bonuses have been cut at least in half. Outsiders remain aghast that bonuses have been paid at all. But that isn't the only shocker. In this supposedly most meritocratic of industries, staff at the worst-performing institutions have absorbed the least pain. 
 Take a look around. A Goldman Sachs partner who earned $2 million in 2007 would have made about $500,000 for 2008. The cuts will not have been as harsh for the next layer down, and Goldman eased the sting in any case by allowing previously earned restricted shares to be sold more quickly. 
 At JPMorgan, the $2 million bonus of a year ago would have shrunk to around $1 million. Of course, about 40 percent of the sum was paid in options that have not fared as well as the stock component that Goldman bankers received. JPMorgan shares are down 22 percent so far this year, while Goldman's have held steady since compensation shares were priced in late December. 
 The real winners were survivors of banks relegated to the history books. Brokers from Bear Stearns were retained by JPMorgan on boom-time packages. Similar deals were struck by the sales and trading standouts from Lehman Brothers who were hired by Barclays in the United States. The beds of Lehman's top brass in Europe and Asia were feathered by Nomura with two years of bonuses, mostly in cash and at 2007 levels. 
 These retention packages were made when the threat of competitive hiring seemed distant. But the industry's pay culture -- which dictates that bankers need big checks to work for new masters -- still prevailed. Some firms already have vowed to reform their compensation schemes. With individuals from reckless firms doing so well in a year like 2008, shareholders should light a fire under those efforts.

HEADLINE: A Test for Liberals

BYLINE: By JIM RUTENBERG

 BODY:
For eight years, they were on the outside looking in -- usually hurling brickbats.
 Now, liberal groups that fought President George W. Bush on war, the environment and entitlement programs are in the unfamiliar position of supporting the man in the Oval Office. 
 And, in a first test of where they will fit in the new national dialogue, some of the groups are trying to sell President Obama's economic stimulus package with an advertising campaign intended to press several Republican senators to support it (unlike their House colleagues).
 Sponsored by MoveOn.org, Americans United for Change and two labor groups -- the Service Employees International Union and the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees -- the advertisements will begin running this week in Alaska, Iowa, Maine, New Hampshire and Washington, D.C.
 The spots show a shuttered factory springing back to life as oratory from Mr. Obama plays in the background. (''The first job of my administration is to put people back to work,'' he says.) 
 They call upon senators in each state -- Lisa Murkowski in Alaska, Charles E. Grassley in Iowa, Susan M. Collins and Olympia J. Snowe in Maine and Judd Gregg in New Hampshire -- to ''support the Obama plan for jobs, not the failed policies of the past.''
 Brad Woodhouse, the president of Americans United for Change, said the groups were paying $500,000 to run the spots. JIM RUTENBERG

HEADLINE: Lilly's Big Day

BYLINE: By GAIL COLLINS

 BODY:
President Obama is scheduled to sign the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act into law today. (This is, technically, his second bill-signing, not the first. But you cannot possibly expect us to make a fuss about legislation fixing the salary of the secretary of the interior.) 
 ''I'm so excited I can hardly stand it,'' Ledbetter said recently after the bill passed the Senate. 
 Obama told her story over and over when he campaigned for president: How Ledbetter, now 70, spent years working as a plant supervisor at a tire factory in Alabama. How, when she neared retirement, someone slipped her a pay schedule that showed her male colleagues were making much more money than she was. A jury found her employer, the Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company, to be really, really guilty of pay discrimination. But the Supreme Court, in a 5-to-4 decision led by the Bush appointees, threw out Ledbetter's case, ruling that she should have filed her suit within 180 days of the first time Goodyear paid her less than her peers.
 (Let us pause briefly to contemplate the chances of figuring out your co-workers' salaries within the first six months on the job.)
 Until the Supreme Court stepped in, courts generally presumed that the 180-day time limit began the last time an employee got a discriminatory pay check, not the first. In an attempt at bipartisan comity, the Senate decided to simply restore the status quo, rejecting House efforts to make the law tougher. Even then, only five Republican senators voted for it -- four women and Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania, who is currently the most threatened of the deeply endangered species known as moderate Republicans.
 Ledbetter, who was widowed in December, won't get any restitution of her lost wages; her case can't be retried. She's now part of a long line of working women who went to court and changed a little bit of the world in fights that often brought them minimal personal benefit.
 Another was Eulalie Cooper, a flight attendant who sued Delta Air Lines in the mid-'60s when she was fired for being married. Not only did a Louisiana judge uphold the airline industry's bizarre rules requiring stewardesses to be young and single, Cooper was denied unemployment benefits on the grounds that by getting married she left her job ''voluntarily.''
 But she began a pattern of litigation that eventually ended the industry's insistence that women needed to look like sex objects in order to properly care for passengers on airplanes. Next time you talk about US Airways Flight 1549's spectacular landing on the Hudson River, remember that the three flight attendants who kept calm in the ditched plane were all women in their 50s and give a nod to people like Eulalie Cooper.
 Patricia Lorance, an Illinois factory worker, went to court after her union and employer secretly agreed to new seniority rules that discriminated against the women who had been promoted in the post-Civil Rights Act era of the 1970s. Like Ledbetter, she lost her court fight because of a ridiculous ruling about timing, which had to be fixed by Congress.
 Working at a series of lower-paying jobs after the factory closed, and then disabled by physical ailments, Lorance lost track of her case long before it finally wound its way through the Supreme Court. ''But to this day, I am rather proud of myself because I was not a dumb person. I believe in just standing up and fighting for your own rights,'' she said in a phone interview. 
 Ledbetter's real soul sister is Lorena Weeks of Wadley, Ga. Weeks, now 80, had worked two jobs to support her orphaned siblings, then struggled with her husband to set enough money aside to assure their children would be able to go to college. A longtime telephone employee, she applied for a higher-paying job overseeing equipment at the central office. Both her union and the management said the job was unsuitable for a woman because it involved pushing 30-pound equipment on a dolly, even though Weeks regularly toted around a 34-pound typewriter at her clerical job.
 Weeks v. Southern Bell helped smash employers' old dodge of keeping women out of higher-paying positions by claiming that they required qualifications only men could fulfill. But it was a long, painful fight during which Weeks was terrified that she might lose her job entirely. ''I felt like I was so alone, and yet I knew I was doing what God wanted me to do. Going back to the fact my momma had died working so hard. And I knew women worked and needed a place in the world,'' she said.
 It's a good day for the feisty working women who went to court to demand their rights and the frequently underpaid lawyers who championed them. They're strangers to one another; most of them made their stands and then returned to their ordinary lives. But they're a special sorority all the same. And Lilly Ledbetter got to go to the inauguration and dance with the new president.
 ''Tell her congratulations,'' said Lorena Weeks. 

CORRECTION-DATE: January 30, 2009

 CORRECTION:
An article on Wednesday about final passage by Congress of pay-discrimination legislation misstated the number of bills signed by President Obama. Until he signed the pay-discrimination measure on Thursday, Mr. Obama had signed no bills -- not one. (The one bill signing attributed to Mr. Obama, a measure affecting the salary of the secretary of the interior, was signed by then-President Bush, days before he left office.) The error was repeated on Thursday in an Op-Ed page column by Gail Collins about the pay-discrimination bill.

HEADLINE: Putting Torture Behind Us

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF

 BODY:
President Obama is resisting calls for an investigation into torture and other abuses during the Bush years, so the chance to learn from our mistakes is slipping away.
 Mr. Obama understandably wants to focus on economic recovery rather than a dissection of the past. Why fritter political capital on an inquest that would antagonize Republicans and imperil our economy and his agenda?
 But as George Santayana, the eminent Harvard philosopher wrote: ''Those who forget history are destined to repeat it.'' Rather than lose forever the chance to grow from our missteps, here's a two-step proposal for confronting the past without distracting from the work on the economic crisis. 
 The first step is to appoint a high-level commission -- perhaps a McCain-Scowcroft Commission? -- to investigate torture, secret detention and wiretapping during the Bush years, as well as to look ahead and offer recommendations for balancing national security and individual rights in the future.
 This wouldn't be a bipartisan commission, with Democrats and Republicans offsetting each other in seething distrust. Rather, it would be nonpartisan, dominated by military and security experts.
 It could be co-chaired by Brent Scowcroft and John McCain, with its conclusions written by Philip Zelikow, a former aide to Condoleezza Rice who wrote the best-selling report of the 9/11 commission. 
 If the three most prominent members were all Republicans, no one on the right could denounce it as a witch hunt -- and its criticisms would have far more credibility. The commission could be rounded out by former generals, top intelligence officials and outside experts without a strong partisan cast: people like Richard Haass, Anthony Zinni, Joseph Nye, James Dobbins and William Cohen.
 Democrats might begrudge the heavy Republican presence on such a commission, but surely any panel is better than where we're headed: which is no investigation at all. And the truth is that many generals are privately aghast at torture because it undermines their own ''hearts and minds'' counterinsurgency efforts, and because it adds to the risk that our own troops will face the same in enemy hands. My bet, based on my conversations with military and intelligence experts, is that such a commission would issue a stinging repudiation of torture that no one could lightly dismiss.
 As a nation, we've repeatedly trampled on individual rights during moments of national fear -- the Palmer raids after World War I, the internment of Japanese-Americans, the McCarthy hearings at the dawn of the cold war. We may well do so again after the next major terror attack, particularly if it turns out to have been planned by people who were released from Guantanamo.
 We'll be better off if we come to some consensus on these issues. The Kerner commission on race and the 9/11 commission are both examples of how we as a nation used such panels to gain a better understanding of our shortcomings. Such a commission would also help heal the divisions with the rest of the world and help renew America's reputation.
 The second step has to do in particular with transforming Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. Mr. Obama's pledge to close the prison there within a year is a big help, but even so the word ''Guantanamo'' will live as a recruiting tool for Muslim terror groups.
 So let's do more than just close the prison. The best move would be to hand Guantanamo back to the Cubans.
 Why spend tens of millions each year for a naval base that has very little military utility? We can project power in the region from Florida, and the main effect of the base has been to bolster Cuba's Communist regime by creating a nationalist backlash and a scapegoat for the Castros' repression and incompetence.
 Granted, returning the base to Cuba may not be politically realistic. So here's a fallback alternative: turn the base into a research center for tropical diseases.
 This was proposed in a medical journal, PLoS Neglected Tropical Diseases, a year ago, and it makes more sense now than ever. 
 In Latin America and the Caribbean, there are still more than half-a-million cases annually of dengue fever (which causes excruciating pain and sometimes death), nearly 50,000 new cases of leprosy and more than 700,000 cases of elephantiasis (which causes grotesque deformities). In addition, 50 million Latin Americans have hookworms inside them, often causing anemia and making it more difficult for children to concentrate in school. 
 Peter Hotez, the president of the Sabin Vaccine Institute at George Washington University and the editor of PLoS Neglected Tropical Diseases, says that an international center on Guantanamo could become a symbol of United States cooperation in the region.
 Imagine if people around the world came to think of Guantanamo as a place where America led a battle against hookworms and leprosy. That would help us fight terrorism far more effectively than the prison at Guantanamo ever did.

HEADLINE: ConocoPhillips Posts $31 Billion Quarterly Loss

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

DATELINE: HOUSTON 

 BODY:
ConocoPhillips, the energy company, posted a fourth-quarter loss of $31.76 billion Wednesday, hurt by $34 billion in asset write-downs and falling crude oil prices. 
 The company also gave a dire forecast for the next couple of years. 
 The chief executive, James J. Mulva, said the company was preparing for a significant, multiyear recession.
 ConocoPhillips ''is planning for a prolonged and difficult business environment,'' Mr. Mulva told analysts during a conference call, noting that ''2009 and 2010 will be very challenging for our global economy and the energy business.''
 The company, based in Houston, said the results amounted to a loss of $21.37 a share and was in contrast to a profit of $4.4 billion, or $2.71 a share, a year earlier. 
 Revenue fell 18 percent to $44.5 billion, from $52.7 billion a year ago.
 Excluding the write-downs and other one-time items, adjusted earnings for the fourth quarter were $1.9 billion, or $1.28 a share, 6 cents better than the consensus Wall Street estimate of Thomson Reuters. 
 Stock in ConocoPhillips rose 65 cents, to $50.16 a share. 
 ConocoPhillips advised two weeks ago it planned to write down the good-will value of some assets, as well as cut 1,300 jobs and lower capital spending by 18 percent this year.
 Like the rest of the industry, ConocoPhillips was hit hard by oil's unprecedented plunge after it peaked above $147 a barrel in July. When the fourth quarter began Oct. 1, crude oil was trading at around $100 a barrel. By year's end, the price was down to $44.60.
 Despite decreased spending, Mr. Mulva said, the company was largely committed to its major, multiyear projects. The company will put off some refinery upgrades and cut back on some drilling in the United States and Canada that does not make economic sense at current prices.
 For all of 2008, ConocoPhillips said it swung to a loss of $17 billion, or $11.16 a share, from a profit of $11.9 billion, or $7.22 a share, in 2007. On an adjusted basis, full-year earnings amounted to $16.4 billion, or $10.66 a share, up from $15.2 billion, or $9.21 a share, in the prior year.
 Revenue rose 28 percent last year, to $240.8 billion.

HEADLINE: Wachovia Acquisition Drags Down Wells Fargo

BYLINE: By ERIC DASH and MICHAEL DE LA MERCED

 BODY:
Wells Fargo reported a $2.55 billion fourth-quarter loss on Wednesday in the first signs that its hurried acquisition of the troubled Wachovia Corporation would be a long and difficult struggle. 
 Wells Fargo, the country's biggest consumer bank, set aside more than $21.7 billion to cover losses amid a nationwide housing slump and a deepening recession. Wells Fargo already had one of the biggest real estate portfolios of any bank. But with the Wachovia deal it absorbed more than $219 billion worth of commercial real estate and corporate loans, and a big book of at-risk mortgages. 
 The firm's $2.55 billion fourth-quarter loss, which amounts to 79 cents a share, is in contrast to a profit of $1.36 billion, or 41 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue in the quarter was $9.8 billion, down 4 percent from $10.2 billion. 
 ''The environment in which Wells Fargo operates continued to be challenging in the fourth quarter and, if anything, became even more difficult, with the unexpected, abrupt and sharp decline in economic activity late in the quarter,'' John G. Stumpf, Wells Fargo's chief executive, said in a statement. 
 Still, Mr. Stumpf added that he felt better about the Wachovia deal now than he did when it was first announced, and the bank said it had no plans to request additional government money. 
 The results, though better than some analysts expected, are more dismal than anticipated only a few months ago, when Wells Fargo was viewed to be one of the banking industry's healthiest players. Its executives have long contended that its stringent lending standards and strong balance sheet would enable it to weather any financial storm. 
 In mid-October, Richard M. Kovacevich, Well Fargo's chairman, was so confident that he insisted to the Treasury that his bank did not want or need government money, even though he did accept it. 
 ''We did make some mistakes, but, for the most part, we maintained our credit discipline,'' Mr. Stumpf said. ''As a result, our company at year-end 2008 was one of the world's strongest financial institutions.'' 
 But Wells Fargo, like its bigger rivals in the banking industry, must grapple with the still-dismal housing market and an expected rise in defaults on other kinds of consumer debt like credit cards and car loans. 
 Bank of America and Citigroup both reported multibillion-dollar losses for their fourth quarters, and while JPMorgan Chase reported a profit, it is expected to face pressure as well. 
 But on Wednesday, shares of Wells Fargo, as well as those of other banks, rose sharply, partly on speculation that the federal government was preparing to absorb toxic assets on banks' balance sheets. 
 Stock in Wells Fargo, which is based in San Francisco, rose $5, or 31 percent, to $21.19 a share.
 Ever since it announced the acquisition last fall, analysts have questioned whether Wells Fargo could handle adding Wachovia's substantial collection of bad assets. Its big presence in California, one of the areas most affected by the housing crisis, made it particularly vulnerable to a sharp downturn even before the Wachovia deal. 
 Wells Fargo said it wrote off $294 million in the fourth quarter because some of its customers were hit hard by the financier Bernard L. Madoff's apparent $50 billion Ponzi scheme and were unable to pay their loans.
 Wells Fargo said the Madoff-related loss accounted for 5 cents of its 79-cent-a-share loss. None of the other big American banks have made similar disclosures related to Mr. Madoff.
 But Wells Fargo executives have maintained they did not bite off more than they could chew. The bank said it added $8.1 billion in reserves and took more than $38 billion in charges on the mortgages that virtually sank Wachovia. Wells Fargo also took nearly $900 million in write-downs on its own portfolio of loans.

HEADLINE: The Stimulus Advances

 BODY:
The signature achievement of the $819 billion stimulus and recovery bill, passed on Wednesday by the House, is that it directs most of its resources where they would do the most good to stimulate the economy. 
 The bill is large because this deep recession is getting deeper, and the recovery, when it comes, is expected to be slow. President Obama and the lawmakers who wrote the bill are to be commended for not letting size distort the substance. Contrary to the claims of Republican opponents that the bill indiscriminately rains money down, the amounts and categories of spending have, for the most part, been calculated carefully and chosen well. 
 Nearly 30 percent is devoted to unemployment benefits, food stamps and fiscal aid to states so that they don't have to cut services, raise taxes and lay off employees and contractors. Evidence is overwhelming that such spending yields the biggest return for every dollar spent. The bill, however, takes into account that these areas cannot absorb unlimited money. In calculating the expanded food stamps, for instance, it provides a significant increase immediately that would otherwise have occurred over time in line with inflation. That way, ample funds are available when needed, but there is no sudden cut off down the road. 
 Aid to states also is well thought out. The single biggest chunk of spending -- $87 billion for states to shore up Medicaid programs -- would allow them to provide care to the neediest, whose ranks have been swelled by the deepening recession. Equally important, by taking on more of the states' Medicaid burden, the federal government frees up states to continue providing other services that would have had to have been cut.
 One of those vulnerable areas, states' education budgets, is the main target of another $79 billion. The money would help to prevent lapses in early childhood education, which often cannot be made up later. It would also prevent cuts in the curriculum and in extracurricular activities in grade schools through college -- while averting big layoffs in a sector that is among the largest employers in many states. 
 After jobless benefits, food stamps and aid to states, the most effective stimulus is to get money directly to low- and middle-income Americans, who are likely to spend it quickly, boosting demand. The package expands the Earned Income Tax Credit temporarily to raise the pay of the working poor. There also is money to allow low-income workers to qualify for a tax credit of up to $1,000 per child, a break currently denied them. These are good tax policy and good stimulus.
 The measure devotes $145 billion to Mr. Obama's ''Making Work Pay'' tax credit for the next two years. The credit, up to $500 per worker, would be more effective as stimulus if the cutoff for eligibility were lower. The richer the recipient, the more likely it is that the money would be saved, not spent. 
 Having maxed out on the most powerful forms of stimulus and facing an economic downturn that requires still more government intervention to prevent a more disastrous downward spiral, lawmakers sensibly expanded the package into other areas. It contains $62 billion on infrastructure spending for highways, mass transit and school buildings, and tens of billions more for other projects. It also includes $40 billion to subsidize the cost of health coverage for the unemployed.
 Republicans' objections are mostly ideological. They worry, in particular, that subsidizing health insurance may be a step toward universal coverage. They may be right. But that is an argument for another day. The government must act urgently to protect the vulnerable from what is shaping up to be the worst recession in modern history and to boost the economy at a time when consumer and business spending is slack. Besides, a lamentably large amount of money goes to business tax cuts dear to Republicans. That is folly as stimulus but more than enough for political compromise.
 A more thoughtful criticism is that the package is not more transformative in scope. There is more money for fixing roads, but not for high-speed railroads; for Head Start, but not for curriculum reform. That, too, is a discussion for another day. 
 Indeed, even with an $819 billion package, the challenge for the Obama administration is to lower expectations, not raise them. The hole the economy is in is so deep that even the stimulus package will only dig us halfway out. According to recent testimony by Douglas Elmendorf, the director of the Congressional Budget Office, without the stimulus, the economy in 2010 could underperform its potential by an amount equal to 6.3 percent of gross domestic product. With the plan, the gap could be, at best, about half that. 
 It will be a long and unpleasant climb from the ruins of the economy. But the House stimulus package is a good first step. The Senate, which takes up its version next week, should follow suit.

HEADLINE: Geithner Says Financial Plan Is in the Works

BYLINE: By STEPHEN LABATON and EDMUND L. ANDREWS; Eric Dash in New York contributed reporting.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
As lawmakers pressed the Obama administration for details of how it would assist financial firms that have been rapidly deteriorating, Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner said Wednesday the administration is working on a comprehensive plan to ''repair the financial system.''
 Mr. Geithner declined to provide any specific details or to address rising calls for the creation of a government institution to buy or guarantee the declining assets at several of the nation's largest banks. He discouraged speculation that the plan would include the nationalization of some banks.
 ''We have a financial system that is run by private shareholders, managed by private institutions, and we'd like to do our best to preserve that system,'' he said. 
 But bank stocks surged on hopes the government was moving toward creating a ''bad bank'' to purge toxic assets from balance sheets that are rapidly deteriorating as the economy worsens. On Wednesday, the Federal Reserve cautioned that the economy was still spiraling downward on many fronts. 
 According to several Wall Street officials, senior administration members spent the weekend and the last few days reaching out to top bankers for their views on how a bad bank should be structured. Lawrence H. Summers, head of the White House's National Economic Council; Sheila C. Bair, the Federal Insurance Deposit Corporation chairwoman; and Mr. Geithner have been involved in the talks, the Wall Street officials said.
 Federal policy makers are discussing how to use the second $350 billion portion of bailout funds. About $50 billion to $100 billion is expected to be allocated to stave off home foreclosures. That would leave up to $250 billion available for the banks, with the bulk going to buying troubled assets. 
 On Wednesday, the head of the Congressional Budget Office told lawmakers that weakening banks would probably need hundreds of billions in additional funds beyond the Troubled Asset Relief Program, or TARP. 
 But administration officials believe that trillions of dollars more may be needed to buy the majority of bad assets from banks. 
 ''The size of the problem is so large that no one knows if you just wiped out all the assets, how much it would cost,'' said Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York and vice chairman of the Joint Economic Committee. He added that a number of officials estimate it may take up to $3 trillion to $4 trillion to buy the bad assets. 
 Federal officials are trying to find a delicate balance between stabilizing banks and keeping the nation's finances steady. Mr. Summers privately expressed concern last week that spending too much to buy bad assets could cripple the dollar, according to a person who spoke with him. 
 Administration officials are also worried that lawmakers might reject the high price tag. At the same time, spending too little may not provide enough to plug the deepening hole.
 ''None of the solutions are very easy,'' Mr. Schumer said. ''All of these proposals sound very appealing until you start to examine them in detail. And then you find that all of them have problems. The good bank-bad bank idea -- the problem, first and foremost, is how do you value the assets? No one knows how to do that.'' 
 Lawmakers have complained that the $350 billion already spent under TARP has failed to prevent institutions from continuing to decline. On Wednesday, several senior members of Congress, including Christopher J. Dodd, chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, and Barney Frank, chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, urged the administration to detail swiftly how it will run the assets program.
 Administration officials have been moving with some caution. They say that they hope to avoid the spectacle of the last administration, which lurched from policy to policy, and in the process lost some credibility in Congress. 
 Senior officials including Ben S. Bernanke, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, and Ms. Bair have recommended that the new administration consider a so-called aggregator bank that would relieve banks of their worst assets. Such a move, they contend, would restore investor confidence in the banks and encourage investors to provide them with fresh capital. 
 One version of the plan being floated by bankers would have the F.D.I.C. take the lead in running the ''bad bank'' and buying the toxic assets for a combination of cash and notes backed by the bad bank. 
 In return, the government would demand some sort of equity stake. The banks would still be responsible for collecting payments on the loans that they sold, according to bankers briefed on the situation. 
 Other issues still need to be resolved, including how the government would determine what to pay for the toxic assets, which assets would qualify, and what conditions might be attached. Also under discussion was whether to require banks that dump their assets into the fund to separately raise private capital. That could put pressure on weaker banks.
 Government officials are considering other ideas for stabilizing the financial system. Those include expanding the types of government guarantees given to Citigroup and Bank of America to cover more assets at more financial companies. Another idea is to pour even more federal money into the banks, possibly in return for common stock. 
 In a sense the debate over creation of an aggregator bank or nationalization is really a discussion over how much to expand policies begun during the Bush administration, officials said on Wednesday. 
 The government in effect has already nationalized several large institutions, including the American International Group, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, when it seized control. And it has taken the same steps as creating a bad bank when it took $29 billion in assets held by Bear Stearns and guaranteed more than $300 billion in declining assets at Citigroup.
 Officials said the debate within the administration was over how much and under what terms to extend those programs to other institutions. Compounding the complexity is the fact that the administration is simultaneously asking for a stimulus package of more than $800 billion. 
 Moreover, as the excesses of Wall Street -- from expensive corporate jets at Citigroup to huge bonuses and extravagant renovations at Merrill Lynch -- ring through Capitol Hill, the idea of a large bailout that does not penalize shareholders and senior executives becomes a tough sell.
 The concept of a bad bank has gained momentum in the financial industry as the economy deteriorates, slashing the value of risky assets on banks' books and increasing the need for banks to hold capital against those losses. 
 Shares in Citigroup and Bank of America, which both recently received a second taxpayer lifeline, surged 19 percent and 14 percent respectively as the stock market rose on optimism that the administration would relieve banks of money-losing assets. 
 The Fed said Wednesday the economy remained gloomy, and vowed to use ''all available tools to promote the resumption of sustainable economic growth and to preserve price stability.'' Its Federal Open Market Committee voted to keep the federal funds target rate at zero to 0.25 percent.
 Analysts estimated that the economy contracted by more than 5 percent in the fourth quarter, one of the sharpest quarterly drops in decades. Employers eliminated two million jobs from September through December.
 In the past, the Fed has tried to steer the overall economy almost entirely through the federal funds rate, the rate that banks charge each other to lend overnight reserves. But because banks remained reluctant to lend, even after the Fed lowered the overnight rate time after time, the central bank began creating new programs last fall in which it stepped in as a lender itself. 
 To push down interest rates on mortgages, the Fed began a program this month to buy $500 billion in mortgage-backed securities issued by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and the federal agencies. Buying large volumes of a security pushes up its price in the market, which leads to lower yields or interest rates. 
 Thus far, the Fed has bought about $53 billion of the securities. But rates for the kind of traditional mortgages that Fannie and Freddie guarantee dropped sharply and stayed low as soon as the Fed announced plans for the program in late November. 
 The committee also served notice that it might purchase longer-term Treasury bonds, a move that would drive down long-term interest rates of all types. 
 In the next several weeks, the Fed expects to start a $200 billion program to finance securities backed by consumer loans, including car loans and credit card debt. This month, the Fed started a program to buy $500 billion in mortgage-backed securities. 
 Wednesday's policy vote was not unanimous. Jeffrey M. Lacker, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, in Virginia, voted against the decision. 
 Help for Credit Unions
 The United States agreed to inject $1 billion of new capital and provide backing for corporate credit unions facing mounting losses on their investments in mortgages, a federal agency said.
 The agency, the National Credit Union Administration, said on Wednesday it would guarantee uninsured lender assets through next month and set up a voluntary program through 2010. The U.S. Central Corporate Federal Credit Union will get a $1 billion federal injection that will raise the public's confidence in credit unions, the lender said.

HEADLINE: HOUSE APPROVES $819 BILLION PLAN FOR ECONOMIC AID

BYLINE: By JACKIE CALMES

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Without a single Republican vote, President Obama won House approval on Wednesday for an $819 billion economic recovery plan as Congressional Democrats sought to temper their own differences over the enormous package of tax cuts and spending. 
 As a piece of legislation, the two-year package is among the biggest in history, reflecting a broad view in Congress that urgent fiscal help is needed for an economy in crisis, at a time when the Federal Reserve has already cut interest rates almost to zero. 
 But the size and substance of the stimulus package remain in dispute, as House Republicans argued that it tilted heavily toward new spending instead of tax cuts. 
 All but 11 Democrats voted for the plan, and 177 Republicans voted against it. The 244-to-188 vote came a day after Mr. Obama traveled to Capitol Hill to seek Republican backing, if not for the package then on other issues to come.
 Mr. Obama, in a statement hailing the House passage of the plan, did not take note of the partisan divide but signaled that he expected changes to be made in the Senate that might attract support.
 ''I hope that we can continue to strengthen this plan before it gets to my desk,'' he said. ''But what we can't do is drag our feet or allow the same partisan differences to get in our way. We must move swiftly and boldly to put Americans back to work, and that is exactly what this plan begins to do.''
 Mr. Obama followed the House vote with a cocktail party at the White House for the Congressional leaders of both parties, from the House and the Senate. The House Republicans, including the minority leader, Representative John A. Boehner of Ohio, were fresh from their votes against the recovery package.
 The failure to win Republican support in the House seemed to echo the early months of the last Democratic administration, when President Bill Clinton in 1993 had to rely solely on Democrats to win passage of a deficit-reduction bill that was a signature element of his presidency. 
 Mr. Obama's chief of staff, Rahm Emanuel, had met Tuesday night at the White House with 11 moderate House Republicans, none of whom ended up supporting the bill. ''The most important number here for this recovery plan is how many jobs it produces, not how many votes it gets,'' Mr. Emanuel said.
 As Senate Democrats prepare to bring their version of the package to the floor on Monday, House Democrats and the administration indicated they would ultimately accept a provision in the emerging Senate package that would adjust the alternative minimum tax to hold down many middle-class Americans' income taxes for 2009. The provision was not in the House legislation.
 Its cost would drive the overall package's tally to nearly $900 billion. That would exceed the roughly $850 billion limit that Mr. Obama has set for Congress, House Democratic leadership aides said, and leave no room for other proposals that senators of both parties are poised to seek during Senate debate next week.
 While the House and Senate measures are similar, they are most likely to differ in ways that could snarl negotiations between Democrats from the two chambers, and delay getting a measure to the president. In particular, House and Senate Democrats are split over how to divide $87 billion in relief to the states for Medicaid, with senators favoring a formula more beneficial to less-populous states.
 Democrats' own differences aside, they also are under pressure from the White House to be open to proposals from Senate Republicans who might support the final legislation if their interests are accommodated, and which might draw a few Republican supporters on a final vote next month in the House.
 The provision on the alternative minimum tax, for example, was a priority for Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa, who added it Tuesday in the Finance Committee's work on the legislation.
 Democrats' goal is to have the stimulus package, which is roughly two-thirds new spending and one-third tax cuts, to Mr. Obama's desk for his signature by Feb. 13, before Congress breaks for Presidents' Day. 
 ''He said he wanted action, bold and swift, and that is exactly what we're doing today,'' Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Democrat of California, said as debate began.
 Democrats voluntarily dropped from the package several provisions that Republicans had singled out for derision in recent days, including money to restore the Jefferson Memorial and for family planning programs. But the day's debate contrasted with the president's conciliatory gestures. 
 Representative Virginia Foxx, Republican of North Carolina, said that former President George Bush's signature tax cuts in 2001 had created years of growth but that the nation's problems started when Democrats regained majorities in Congress in the 2006 elections.
 Representative Steny H. Hoyer, Democrat of Maryland and the majority leader, said that ''the economics that got us into this mess'' were the Republicans' policies for the six years that Republicans controlled both the White House and Congress, through 2006.
 The House voted down several Republican proposals, including a substitute package made up entirely of tax cuts for individuals and businesses. Republicans did not say how much their package would cost, although Mr. Boehner said it would be far less than the Democratic plan. That tax-cut-only approach was defeated on a mostly party-line vote of 266 to 170; two Democrats joined all but nine moderate Republicans in voting for the Republican plan.
 By another near-party-line vote, 270 to 159, the House rejected a Republican plan to delete a number of spending programs, including several representing top campaign promises of Mr. Obama, and to add instead $36 billion for highway construction, more than doubling the $30 billion in the bill, and $24 billion for Army Corps of Engineers projects.
 After the final vote, Representative Eric Cantor of Virginia, the second-ranking House Republican, called the Democratic package ''a spending bill beyond anyone's imagination.''
 Some Democrats seemed surprised that no Republicans voted for the measure.
 ''Not one person felt his or her district needed to have any of this assistance?'' Representative Rosa DeLauro, Democrat of Connecticut, asked of the Republicans. ''That can't be.''
 Brad Woodhouse, president of the union-supported, pro-Democratic group Americans United for Change, e-mailed a statement condemning the Republicans' opposition under the subject line ''Political Suicide.''

HEADLINE: Suing the Belugas

 BODY:
In October, while Gov. Sarah Palin of Alaska was campaigning to be vice president, the federal government added the beluga whales in the state's Cook Inlet to the endangered species list. At the time, Governor Palin opposed the listing, saying it would be ''premature.'' (She said the same thing about protecting polar bears.) Now Ms. Palin has announced that she will sue to remove the whales from the protection of the Endangered Species Act. 
 In Governor Palin's view, what is really endangered is Alaska's economic growth. Cook Inlet, the long arm of water that reaches toward Anchorage from the Gulf of Alaska, is one of the busiest and fastest-developing regions in the state. There are plans for gas and oil development, an expansion of the Port of Anchorage, as well as a possible new bridge.
 Ms. Palin argues that the state has already taken adequate measures to protect the belugas. The numbers certainly argue otherwise. The beluga population in Cook Inlet last year was estimated at 375, down from a high of 653 in 1994.
 In explaining her intent to file suit, the governor has challenged virtually every aspect of the listing decision -- including the scientific finding that these belugas are a separate and distinct genetic population seriously at risk. Former Senator Ted Stevens went so far as to call the listing ''a deliberate targeting of an area vital to the Alaskan economy.'' 
 There is no doubt that Cook Inlet is vital to Alaskans. But it is also vital to the species that live in its waters. Listing the belugas does not mean shutting down the economy of the Cook Inlet. It means adjusting it to accommodate species that cannot adapt or survive any other way.

HEADLINE: How Clean Is Coal?

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Some of the myths perpetuated in your Jan. 23 editorial ''Collapse of the Clean Coal Myth'' need some collapsing of their own. 
 Coal is America's most affordable and abundant domestic energy resource and provides half the electricity used to light our homes and run our factories. More important, today's coal-based electricity generation is 70 to 90 percent cleaner than the plants that are being replaced -- close to eliminating historical contributions to acid rain and smog. Just on the horizon is FutureGen in Mattoon, Ill., a coal-based power plant that will be virtually emissions free, including virtually free of carbon emissions.
 The investments made thus far in ''clean coal technologies,'' a term coined by Congress more than 20 years ago and not the recent creation of advertising as you suggest, have produced nearly $100 billion in economic and environmental benefits to the nation, according to government analysis.
 Further, coal producers have restored nearly three million acres of mined land, and we and other customers safely recycle 43 percent of utility-generated coal ash into other beneficial uses and products. Finally, mining achieved its safest year on record in 2008.
 Affordable, secure and increasingly clean coal can help rebuild America's economy. Now is not the time to discount the important progress we have made and will continue to pursue.

HEADLINE: Make That Spot Upbeat (but Caring)

BYLINE: By STUART ELLIOTT

 BODY:
For television viewers, the Super Bowl offers an annual midwinter spectacle. On Sunday, in addition to a football game and a halftime show, they can watch Madison Avenue try to walk a tightrope.
The advertisers, which are spending up to $3 million for each 30-second commercial during Super Bowl XLIII, have a tricky task before them. They must figure out the right way to speak to consumers worried about the wretched economy while at the same time not ignore the long-standing appeal of Super Bowl Sunday as a night of escapist fare.
''Advertisers have to strike a delicate balance this year,'' said Tim Calkins, a marketing professor at the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University.
''They need to recognize the environment we're in,'' Mr. Calkins said, ''so they don't want to appear too flip, making light of a tough situation.'' 
''But the people who watch the Super Bowl, they still want to be entertained,'' he added.
Mr. Calkins likened the challenge the advertisers face to the situation that confronts a political candidate in tough times. ''You don't want to seem tone-deaf,'' he said, ''but you don't get elected telling people how bad things are.''
Previews of some of the commercials that NBC plans to run nationally during the game suggest that advertisers and the agencies creating the spots are tip-toeing along the tightrope.
For instance, at least two advertisers -- the Denny's restaurant chain and the Universal resort in Orlando, Fla. -- intend to run commercials meant to appeal to thrift-minded consumers; the ads will end with special offers.
Such promotions are highly unusual for a Super Bowl, where marketers typically run spots that burnish corporate images or ask consumers to buy products at regular prices. One exception was a commercial that ran during halftime of the 1975 Super Bowl in which Joe Garagiola introduced rebates on Chrysler cars with a ''Buy a car, get a check'' promotion.
''We think this offer will create a lot of excitement,'' said Kurt Kostur, senior vice president for marketing at the Universal Orlando Resort, part of the NBC Universal division of General Electric, and ''strike a chord with today's families.''
Mr. Kostur declined to describe the promotion because, he said, ''we're saving it to reveal within the Super Bowl.''
But it makes sense despite the challenge the economy presents, he added, in that the offer is meant to evoke ''the time you felt you could be anyone, do anything.'' The Universal Orlando Resort commercial was created by David and Goliath, an agency in El Segundo, Calif.
Likewise, Denny's is mum on details about the promotion planned for its first Super Bowl spot ever, created by Goodby, Silverstein & Partners in San Francisco, part of the Omnicom Group. Executives, however, say the offer involves the restaurant chain's Grand Slam breakfast.
''It's above and beyond a coupon,'' said Mark Chmiel, chief marketing officer at Denny's in Spartanburg, S.C., who said the promotion was a response to the slowdown in meals eaten in restaurants since the recession began.
''We have seen evidence that 40 to 50 percent of people are dining out less often,'' Mr. Chmiel said. ''What they're looking for is something that really resonates with them and offers real value.''
In another sign of the (troubled) times, Cash4Gold, a company that pays money for jewelry and other valuables, is buying commercial time for the Super Bowl that might be the first spot in the game from what is known as a direct-response advertiser.
The buy, reported on Thursday by USA Today, raised eyebrows among some who follow the advertising industry, wondering whether the recession was reducing demand for Super Bowl spots among mainstay brands.
''The Super Bowl advertising ranks are usually filled with the big boys of marketing: Anheuser-Busch, Coca-Cola, PepsiCo,'' an article on the Web site of the trade publication Advertising Age began. ''And now: Cash4Gold?''
A spokesman for the NBC Sports unit of NBC, which is overseeing ad sales for Super Bowl XLIII, demurred.
''The Super Bowl obviously is the best way to reach a mass audience,'' said the spokesman, Brian Walker, and Cash4Gold ''saw value in it for their business needs, much in the way the Pepsis and Anheuser-Busches did.''
Even so, Cash4Gold is not running one of its regular commercials, which specialize in hard-sell tactics like repetition of a toll-free telephone number.
Rather, the company worked with two mainstream agencies to create a humorous spot -- with a Web address (Cash4Gold.com) in place of the toll-free number -- that would not seem out of place with Super Bowl spiels from blue-chip brands like Pepsi-Cola or Bud Light.
''We definitely wanted to do a commercial with a creative concept worthy of the Super Bowl,'' said Steve Netzley, chief executive at Euro RSCG Edge in Carlsbad, Calif., part of the Euro RSCG Worldwide division of Havas. His agency worked on the spot with another Havas agency, Arnold Worldwide, and a director, Bryan Buckley, who has directed Super Bowl spots for advertisers like E*Trade and Monster.com.
The Cash4Gold commercial features Ed McMahon and the rapper MC Hammer in a can-you-top-this competition to sell gold memorabilia and other valuables through Cash4Gold.com. The spot even borrows a page from the Super Bowl ad playbook of major marketers by ending with a mildly naughty punch line.
''We absolutely changed up everything for the Super Bowl,'' said Jeff Aronson, chief executive at Cash4Gold in Pompano Beach, Fla., part of Albar Precious Metal Refining, to help the company reach more consumers who may be receptive to its message as a result of the bad economy.
To be sure, many Super Bowl advertisers intend to run commercials looking just like those that have appeared during boom times. Many spots on Sunday will be filled with Super Bowl ad staples like celebrities, special effects, anthropomorphic animals and surprise endings.
''It's a conundrum,'' said Gary Carr, senior vice president for national broadcast at a New York media agency, TargetCast TCM.
''Some boards of directors are saying, 'Let's not do something so high-profile' like advertise on the Super Bowl,'' Mr. Carr said, yet ''the world hasn't come to an end and people still have to sell beer and cars.''
''Companies have to look inside their hearts and minds and do what they feel is right,'' he added.
These are among the other Super Bowl advertisers making decisions reflecting the economy and the national mood:
Almost all the seven beer commercials scheduled by Anheuser-Busch InBev are lighthearted or warmly emotional rather than infused with the slapstick and sight gags. There will be three feel-good spots featuring the tried-and-true Budweiser Clydesdale characters -- the most ever in a single game.
Hyundai Motor America will now devote one of its two commercials in the game to Hyundai Assurance, a policy that helps people who lose their jobs after they buy Hyundai cars.
Monster Worldwide, which operates the Monster.com job-search Web site, is returning to the roster of Super Bowl sponsors for the first time since 2004.
The company joins a competitor, CareerBuilder, owned by a consortium of media companies, to woo workers ''who are concerned over their current and future job status,'' said John Rash, senior vice president and director for media analysis at Campbell Mithun in Minneapolis, part of the Interpublic Group of Companies.
Whatever the economy, the Super Bowl ''still is America's biggest secular holiday,'' he added, ''and a great excuse during a cold winter to get together with friends and family.''
Mr. Rash said he was looking forward to the match-up between ''a marquee team,'' the Pittsburgh Steelers, and ''a Cinderella team,'' the Arizona Cardinals, which is ''rising like a phoenix.''

HEADLINE: After Crash, Before War: A Pivotal Year in Culture

BYLINE: By STEPHEN HOLDEN

 BODY:
In any chronology of 20th-century culture, the year 1939 stands out. This is principally for the quality of the Hollywood films it produced: ''Gone With the Wind,'' ''The Women,'' ''Ninotchka,'' ''Mr. Smith Goes to Washington'' and ''Stagecoach,'' among a long list of American movie classics. 
 Screenings of those five, along with documentaries about the 1939 World's Fair and the dancer and choreographer Jose Limon, as well as ''The City,'' Ralph Steiner and Willard Van Dyke's acclaimed 1939 portrait of the urban jungle (with a score by Aaron Copland), form the motion picture arm of The 1939 Project: American Arts at a Turning Point, a monthlong series that begins on Sunday at Symphony Space. 
 Using 1939 as a platform from which to look forward and back at the evolution of a distinctly American culture, the series branches out from film to survey the classical music, jazz, literature and fine art of the period in concerts and discussions. An entire program is devoted to Raymond Chandler, whose novel ''The Big Sleep'' was published that year.
 Emerging from the Great Depression, the United States maintained an isolationist stance toward the gathering storm overseas. After Germany's invasion of Poland on Sept. 1, 1939, it would be more than two years until the Japanese bombing of Pearl Harbor catapulted America into the fray.
 ''It was an optimistic time,'' said Laura Kaminsky, the project's coordinator, who noted that that happiest of musical styles, big-band swing, was near the peak of its popularity in 1939, even as Kate Smith's recording of ''God Bless America'' became a hit. 
 Here and abroad, modernism was on the rise. Thursday's program, ''Copland and Ives: Piano Masterpieces of 1939,'' is to feature the pianist Sara Laimon performing Copland's Piano Sonata, which was begun in 1939 but had to be reconstructed from memory after a suitcase containing the manuscript was stolen. The other offering, Charles Ives's Piano Sonata No. 2, the ''Concord'' Sonata, was introduced the same year. 
 The Feb. 12 program, ''Chamber Music of 1939,'' compares European music from the period (Bartok and Shostakovich) with American (Samuel Barber and Henry Cowell). Cowell's experiments in percussion, along with those of John Cage and Lou Harrison, will be explored in the Feb. 26 concert, ''The Pulse of 1939,'' which features the Talujon Percussion Quartet. 
 Setting the tone for the series is a discussion on Monday evening, ''American Culture in Context: The Essence of 1939,'' between the author E. L. Doctorow and the presidential historian and Franklin D. Roosevelt scholar Robert Dallek, moderated by Dick Cavett. 
 But if a single event encapsulates the speculative, open-ended spirit of the project, it may be ''Strange Fruit,'' the program next Friday by the singer-songwriter and playwright Eisa Davis. 
 Taking as a starting point the Billie Holiday anti-lynching standard for which the program is titled, Ms. Davis, who appeared in ''Passing Strange'' on Broadway, will examine a tradition of protest music that embraces everything from African freedom songs to Bob Marley to the Ramones' tune ''The KKK Took My Baby Away.'' 
 If 1939 and 2009 have anything in common, it is probably a national mood that seesaws between dread and hope. Seventy years ago, as American self-confidence was reviving, world war loomed. Today, as the economy sinks into recession, and fear seeps into the climate, new leadership in Washington promises unity and collective purpose; whatever happens, momentous change seems as imminent today as it did then. 
 The 1939 Project runs from Sunday through Feb. 26 at Symphony Space, 2537 Broadway, at 95th Street; (212) 864-5400, symphonyspace.org.

HEADLINE: Taking the Waters

BYLINE: By STEVE BAILEY

 BODY:
FOR many people, the point of having a weekend home is that it is a haven from workday routine and daily pressures. And whether it's a place by the shore, in a ski resort or nestled in farm country, your stress-reducing getaway only gets better when you add a hot tub.
 To relax and restore yourself in hot water is an idea that has been around at least since ancient times. The Romans built large communal baths, and Americans have flocked to Hot Springs, Ark., and similar resorts to take advantage of natural springs. 
 The idea of transporting the spring to one's home began in earnest in the 1960s when Californians started putting heated water into large redwood vats. Redwood turned out to be a less than ideal material, but the idea was born. Wood was eventually replaced by acrylic, and the modern ''portable spa,'' as they are called in the industry, arrived, decked out with its own water heater and pumps to power air and/or water jets. 
 Today, if you're considering a hot tub for your second home, you face a bewildering array of brands, product types and options. Here's a guide to navigating the process and ending up with a hot tub that you, your family and your guests will enjoy.
 Find a good dealer. Picking the tub itself is easy if a reputable dealer is advising you. You should talk to friends who have hot tubs, check dealers' reputations with the Better Business Bureau, and look for one who has been around a long time and is likely to survive the current economic downturn. Hot tubs can be bought over the Internet, you and some robust friends can install it, and you can handle maintenance yourself. But as a relaxation-minded second-home owner, you will probably want a relationship with a local dealer who can take care of installation and service.
 ''Most of our customers are looking for ease of use,'' said Al Campbell, who owns Napa Valley Hot Tubs, which has been in business in Napa, Calif., for 33 years. ''They want minimum maintenance.'' That generally includes changing filters regularly, every 30 to 60 days, and draining and cleaning the tub.
 Decide where the hot tub will go. ''Ninety-five percent of our spas are outdoors,'' said Peter Southworth, a partner in Allen Pools and Spas in White River Junction, Vt., which has been in business for 52 years. ''Most go on top of a deck or on a patio, but some condos require that spas are sunk into decks.'' 
 Wherever your tub goes, it has to sit on a strong, stable foundation. A patio should have at least a four-inch-thick concrete pad for the larger tubs, and decks often require substantial reinforcement to support the weight of a tub filled with water and people.
 Hot tubs can be placed indoors, but the humidity they create can be a problem. ''You can use a dehumidifier,'' Mr. Southworth said, ''but in some homes with dry forced-air heating, the humidity is not an issue.'' Some indoor hot tubs are placed in rooms with exhaust fans attached to humidity-detecting controls, so the fans run only when needed. Another approach, for those who don't want to deal with cold winter winds, is to place the tub on an enclosed porch, protected from the wind but not posing interior humidity problems.
 How big a tub? If it's usually just two people at your weekend home, a small tub should do. If you entertain a lot, you might consider a party-size tub. Small or large, consider getting a cover lifter, a hydraulic device that allows one person to remove the insulating cover. 
 Be prepared to pay. Mr. Southworth said his portable spas range from $3,995 for a two-person tub to $10,500 for one that can hold eight or nine people. ''That includes installation,'' he added. Regular service checks cost about $60 a visit. 
 The cost of the tub and maintenance are not the only expenses. Some tubs have natural gas or propane heaters, but most rely on electricity. ''It can be $75 or $80 a month'' added to your electric bill, even if the tub is used only sparingly, Mr. Campbell said. 
 Mr. Southworth said that many of his customers keep their tubs at ready-to-use temperatures, 100 degrees Fahrenheit or higher. Mr. Campbell, though, said his customers tend to keep the water at relatively cool 80 degrees when they're away, then ''flick the switch'' when they arrive at their vacation homes on Friday evenings. ''That gives them three or four hours to go out and have dinner,'' he said, ''and when they come home the spa is ready.''

HEADLINE: Financial Crisis Dims Hopes for Giant Cross-Border Banks in Europe

BYLINE: By CARTER DOUGHERTY

DATELINE: FRANKFURT 

 BODY:
Only a few years ago, the future of European banking was said to belong to European champions, big border-straddling banks that would compete with the American giants.
 Instead, European integration has been replaced by Balkanization. 
 Because of the financial crisis, banks are retrenching and refocusing on their home markets, all but abandoning ambitions of banking on a Continental scale -- or bigger. Strings-attached government rescue plans and basic business logic are driving the change.
 So instead of strategies for global conquest, Martin Blessing, the chief executive of Commerzbank, is concentrating on ways to keep credit flowing to the small and medium-size businesses that form the backbone of the German economy. 
 ''We will see a domestic refocusing of banking but not because everyone is turning nationalist or because one or the other governments take stakes,'' he said during a recent interview at his office in the bank's stunning Norman Foster-designed office tower here. ''Banks are going to look at where their franchise is strongest.'' 
 These new realities could end up hurting Eastern Europe most. After communism, privatization led to an extended gold rush for Western bankers. Now those investors are having to decide whether to continue lending at home -- in France or Austria -- or in Poland, the Czech Republic or Hungary. In the global financial crisis, with the health of many banks dependent on the good will of their home governments, the choice is not hard. The thinking at the heart of cross-border expansion in Europe was always straightforward: Europe needed banks that could achieve economies of scale and have the global reach, global clients and global influence to compete with American titans. 
 Operating on that basis, a handful of European banks moved to grow and consolidate. In 2004, Banco Santander of Spain bought Abbey National of Britain. A year later, Italy's UniCredit swallowed the bank HVB Group of Germany. In early 2007, Royal Bank of Scotland led a consortium that snapped up ABN Amro of the Netherlands for 70 billion euros, or $92 billion at current exchange rates. 
 That deal is already coming undone, with the implosion last year of Fortis, one of Royal Bank's partners. 
 More broadly, nationalist impulses are on the move across the Continent, with many politicians arguing -- as some Democrats are in the United States -- that if the government is going to bail out banks, then taxpayers should get some ownership and some say in how they operate.
 For example, Gordon Brown, the British prime minister, has said he wants to stay out of the operating side of the banks Britain has bailed out. But his government is under heavy pressure to help small businesses at home, and the documents that created the new British vehicle for investing in banks, United Kingdom Financial Investments, cite domestic lending as its priority.
 French and German governments have also injected cash into their banks, both with the goal of keeping money flowing to businesses inside their borders.
 Daniel Gros, director of the Center for European Policy Studies in Brussels, called the developments the Balkanization of European finance.
 ''Whenever governments get into the share capital of banks, even in a small way, of course they think nationally,'' Mr. Gros said.
 For instance, few banks expanded more rapidly in Germany over the last decade than Royal Bank of Scotland. The British financier muscled onto Continental turf with attractive financing packages for German manufacturers. Today, Royal Bank is majority-owned by the British government after losses in 2008 from $:7 billion to $:8 billion, or $9.2 billion to $10.5 billion.
 According to two senior German executives, Royal Bank is now playing tough with German clients, calling in loans as the bank retrenches in favor of its British business. The executives, who asked not to be identified, because they were not authorized to publicly discuss confidential negotiations, said Royal Bank had demanded that its clients on the Continent sell assets, despite the catastrophic state of financial markets, so the bank could recover its cash quickly, perhaps to lend in Britain.
 Most recently, Royal Bank was a major creditor of Adolf Merckle, the German billionaire who killed himself when it became clear the banks -- with Royal Bank in the lead, the executives said -- would insist on the sale of his prized possession, the generic drug maker Ratiopharm.
 Christine Kortyka, a Royal Bank spokeswoman in Germany, denied the bank was retrenching. ''We are an international bank with international clients and we will continue to serve them where they need us,'' she said.
 Mr. Blessing, who took over at Commerzbank just in time to sell a 25 percent stake to the German government to stabilize its finances and complete a major acquisition, does not dispute that governments are angling for national advantage. 
 Commerzbank styles itself the bank of Germany's Mittelstand, as this country's small and midsize companies are known.
 Mr. Blessing says he is comfortable with focusing on serving the Mittelstand, because that has always been the bank's core mission. .
 As part of the deal for a cash infusion, the German government received the right to veto major decisions by the bank. That means it can ward off any acquisition from abroad -- or any effort at a European expansion.

HEADLINE: Help for Addicts Of Many Varieties

BYLINE: By JENNIFER 8. LEE

 BODY:
Researchers and advocates have long argued that gambling addiction is comparable to substance abuse. In that vein, the state has announced a unified 24-hour hot line for people struggling with drug, alcohol and gambling addictions, to begin on Monday. 
The new hot line, 1-877-8-HOPENY (1-877-846-7369), combines a line for problem gambling and another for substance addiction.
''It's about having a solid front on addiction,'' said Karen M. Carpenter-Palumbo, the commissioner of the State Office of Alcoholism and Substance Abuse Services.
According to state data, 2.5 million people in the state have an addiction problem, 1.8 million with a substance like drugs or alcohol, and nearly one million with gambling. Of the 2.5 million, 600,000 are under 21.
''People don't sort themselves out as neatly as government offices do,'' said Gerald McCleery, the associate executive director of the Mental Health Association of New York City, whose office will run the support for the unified hot line. ''People who have substance abuse problems have gambling problems, and people who have gambling problems have substance abuse problems.''
Four years ago, the state moved gambling addiction issues from the Office of Mental Health to the State Office of Alcoholism and Substance Abuse Services. Alcohol and drug addictions were brought under the same umbrella in 1992.
Amid a debate about whether gambling addiction is a disease or a moral weakness, gambling has become an increasingly pressing issue for New York and other states over the last decade.
''There has been a proliferation of casinos and marketing of lotteries, and a proliferation of instant scratch-off tickets,'' Mr. McCleery said. According to the state, 5 percent of New York adults now have a gambling problem. JENNIFER 8. LEE

Pension Fund Down, Not Out: The state pension fund lost about 19 percent of its value between the end of the fiscal year on March 31, 2008, and the end of the calendar year. Considering the state of the economy, that's not too bad.
For example, over the same period, the Standard & Poor's 500 had a decline of roughly 32 percent; the state fund is broadly invested beyond the large American corporations that make up the S.&P. 500.

HEADLINE: N.F.L. Trend In Coaching: The Younger The Better

BYLINE: By JUDY BATTISTA

DATELINE: TAMPA, Fla. 

 BODY:
Maybe someday the new job will take its toll on Raheem Morris and the bags will settle under his eyes and the lines will crease his forehead. But earlier this week, Morris, the recently anointed coach of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, strode through the teeming Super Bowl media center looking not so much like the team's field general as perhaps the field general's son on his way to an interview with the college admissions director.
 At 32, Morris is the latest addition to a sea change in N.F.L. coaching, a rapid move toward younger, less-experienced coaches that has put a fresh face on football and sent coaching graybeards to the sideline. 
 ''This is a copycat league,'' said Steelers Coach Mike Tomlin, who, despite being only 36, was a mentor to Morris at Tampa Bay. ''Some of the success young coaches have had in the last five years has created opportunities for guys like myself. And if we don't win, then we'll get the same treatment older coaches get.'' 
 On Sunday, Tomlin and Arizona's Ken Whisenhunt, two second-year coaches, will meet in the Super Bowl. Tomlin will be the youngest coach in the game's history. Owners have been emboldened by his success and that of the three under-50 rookie head coaches who took their teams to the playoffs this season -- Baltimore's John Harbaugh, Miami's Tony Sparano and Atlanta's Mike Smith.
 In 2006, 5 of the 10 coaches hired for that season were at least 50 years old on opening day. When the 2009 season opens, 11 teams will have different coaches than they did when the 2008 season began. (The Raiders and the Chiefs have not announced their new coaches yet). Just two of the hires so far have had head-coaching experience and one of them is Eric Mangini, who is on his second job at age 38. Three are under 40. 
 The Super Bowl winners Mike Shanahan and Jon Gruden, both of whom were fired this year, are without jobs, as are the veteran coaches Marty Schottenheimer, Jim Fassel and Dan Reeves. (Gruden was once a boy wonder, getting his first head-coaching job at age 34.)
 ''I got comfortable with the idea that I didn't need to go out and hire an older coach with lots of experience,'' said the Denver Broncos' owner, Pat Bowlen, who hired the 32-year-old Josh McDaniels to succeed the 56-year-old Shanahan. ''I was more comfortable with a younger coach with his own ideas. If you backed up five or six years ago, none of us would have taken that leap of faith.'' 
 During the hiring season, owners extolled the virtues of new blood, fresh ideas and improved relations with younger players. What was left unspoken is that these coaches come relatively cheap. Many owners are feeling the pinch from their outside businesses during the recession and some have trimmed their nonfootball staffs, perhaps to lay the groundwork for upcoming collective bargaining negotiations with players.
 Tomlin and Whisenhunt make an average of $2.5 million a year over the length of their contracts. McDaniels will make an average of $3 million a year. Coaches with more established credentials would come with a much bigger price tag. Shanahan's contract had three years and $20 million remaining on it. Mike Holmgren was making a reported $8 million a season when he left the Seahawks. 
 ''Are we paying head coaches too much?'' Bowlen said. ''Yes, we were. Should we be paying less? Yes, I'm happy we are. But I wouldn't make the decision on a head coach based on, I've got to pay this guy 10 or this guy 3. That has no impact. I'd love to pay everybody three. But I'm not going to hire the second-best coach I liked because he is cheaper.'' 
 Instead, Bowlen said, he was impressed by how prepared McDaniels was. Bowlen, who also interviewed Morris, had not hired a coach in 14 years, and he was startled by how far along in their development younger coaches were, even in their comfort level with owners. Bowlen said he believes coaches, like high school students preparing for college, take their preparation more seriously than they did in the past, keeping copious notes of what they observe. They begin their careers as early as possible in the lowest positions -- often quality control assistants -- which offer little pay but plenty of access to coaches and personnel directors.
 McDaniels has been around football since he was a child, learning from his father, a legendary high school coach in Ohio. Jim Schwartz, the Detroit Lions' new coach, started as an unpaid intern on Bill Belichick's Cleveland Browns staff, but he also did statistical analysis projects. Morris was in the league's minority internship program before becoming the Bucs' defensive quality control assistant. 
 Still, despite the occasional success story from the past -- Chuck Noll, Bill Cowher and John Madden were in their 30s when they became head coaches -- the question remained: How could anybody so young be ready for an all-consuming job?
 Morris said he has been surprised that each day something new lands on his desk. ''I don't believe at 62, 32, 42, it's going to be any different when you take this job,'' Morris said. ''Nobody is telling you what to do. Nothing on your desk tells you what to do.'' 
 Even as the defensive backs coach for the Buccaneers, Morris drew attention. He was always the most voluble, high-energy coach on the field, jumping up to hip-bump players, running plays with them in practice, talking in his rapid-fire style to anyone within earshot. 
 Morris was promoted to defensive coordinator when Monte Kiffin left in 2008 to join his son Lane at the University of Tennessee. Lane Kiffin went to the Volunteers after he was fired by the Raiders, who hired him as their coach in January 2007 when he was just 31. 
 Morris had already become a hot commodity on the interview circuit when the Glazer family decided to fire Gruden, in part because players and fans did not like or trust him anymore. Perhaps they were mindful that Tomlin had slipped away, but they cited Morris's ability to relate to players. Indeed, at his first news conference, Morris said the first thing that popped into his head at that moment was, ''Let's dance.'' The Glazers teased him later about how odd it was to see him wearing something other than sweats. 
 ''It wasn't that he was so young, it was that we knew him,'' said Bryan Glazer, the Buccaneers' co-chairman. ''Certain teams, a more mature team -- like when we brought Jon in -- need to get over the hump.
 ''I think we're going to be more to the younger side, we want to build something and he fits what we're trying to do. You're seeing it in all of sports. There is a trend to take a chance on younger people. Younger guys are running baseball teams. You don't have to be older to be smart.'' 
 Players agree that having a younger coach often smoothes relations. Tomlin has grown close to his players and they say talking to him is more like talking to a friend than to a boss. 
 ''He still has part of the urban style a little bit,'' Steelers cornerback Bryant McFadden said of Tomlin. ''A lot of people feel young coaches are easier to relate to. They understand some of the trials and tribulations we're going through. If you have a problem, he always tells us to feel free to come holler at him. He wants to keep all communication lines open.'' 
 Still, managing the relationship can be tricky. When Tomlin went to the Steelers, he was an outsider and he ran a harsh training camp to establish who was boss. 
 But Morris already has close personal relationships with some of the Bucs. After he interviewed in Denver, he went to the home of Buccaneers cornerback Ronde Barber seeking advice.
 Morris is not worried. He said his parents were his best friends, but they were also the bosses, and his motivation was to never disappoint them. That kind of relationship is what he is expecting with the Bucs, even though offensive lineman Davin Joseph said earlier in the week there is some anxiety from players about what style Morris will assume. 
 ''The nature of head coaching and the N.F.L., a lot of that is changing,'' said Barber, who at 33 is a year older than Morris. ''Not that you want to be buddy-buddy with your players because there has to be a separation of church and state. But he's a very personable guy and if you take that away, it changes who he is. I think we'll appreciate the freshness of who he is. It's a 180-degree turn.'' 
 Indeed. While some players wonder how long the trend will last -- the Steelers' Troy Polamalu joked this week that when an 80-year-old wins the Super Bowl, former coaches will come out of the woodwork looking for work -- Morris's youth has been served. To make the point, he called Tomlin his ''crusty old teacher.'' 
 Then, with an eyebrow raised, he archly noted, ''It took him to 34 to be a head coach.''

HEADLINE: Social Security on the First Date

BYLINE: By RAMESH PONNURU. 
Ramesh Ponnuru is a senior editor for National Review.

 BODY:
DEMOCRATS will probably get their way on most policy matters over the next two years, but bipartisan accomplishments won't be easy. Congressional Republicans won their elections too, and they didn't do so by promising to agree to everything that Democrats want. Yes, Democrats have the votes to muscle through a lot of bills without much Republican support -- or any, as the stimulus package passed by the House this week shows. But on some occasions Republican support could be useful. 
 Take Social Security, which President Obama has suggested he wants to reform. A strategy that is supported only by Democrats could result in their having to take full responsibility for a tax-heavy bill, and some would balk at that prospect. This means that the most likely result is inaction. 
 This, after all, is what happened when Republicans tried to reform Social Security. President George W. Bush proposed restraining the growth in benefits and allowing young workers to invest some of their payroll-tax contributions for themselves. In 2005, Democrats almost unanimously believed that personal accounts ''carved out'' of Social Security were a deal-breaker. 
 Instead, they wanted to raise taxes, especially on high earners. They also thought that young people, especially those with low or moderate incomes, should be encouraged to build capital in savings accounts -- but only if these accounts were ''added on'' to Social Security and seeded with tax credits. Congressional Democrats were not willing to cooperate with Mr. Bush, and Congressional Republicans did not want to take full responsibility for reforming Social Security. So nothing was done. 
 The stalemate continues today. To break it, each side will have to give up at least one cherished goal. Republicans must accept that Mr. Bush's dream of letting individuals invest Social Security funds is dead. In return, Democrats will need to take tax increases off the table.
 This compromise seems more likely than other solutions (though less likely than further stalemate), in part because both sides should agree that solvency will require reductions in the growth of benefits. Progressive price indexing is a good option. Under current policy, tomorrow's retirees get greater benefits than today's. Progressive indexing would keep that rule for low-income workers. 
 Benefits for high-income workers would, on the other hand, keep up only with inflation. This policy should be palatable to Democrats. If they agree to take the remaining steps to make the program solvent without tax increases, then Republicans should agree to finance the ''add-on'' savings accounts that Democrats favor.
 This deal has something for everyone. Incumbents in both parties would be able to campaign on having saved the program. Republicans would get a big spending cut and avoid tax increases. Democrats would have blocked Mr. Bush's personal accounts, and put most of the burden of rescuing Social Security on the affluent.
 Mr. Obama would also be able to make good on a campaign promise. During his debates with John McCain, he said Americans would see a ''net spending cut'' under his presidency. Given the amount of stimulus spending that Mr. Obama envisions over the next few years, this kind of large, long-term spending reduction is the only way for that net cut to happen. Mr. Obama could demonstrate that his pledges to get past the stale partisan debates of the past weren't just talk.
 Most important, this compromise would result in good policy. Social Security needs to be brought into balance, and reasonable spending cuts would do less economic damage than tax increases. Long-term investment is still a good idea for young people. Besides, the ideological divide over ''carve-out'' and ''add-on'' accounts is absurd: whether the accounts are inside or outside Social Security is largely a question of accounting.
 And who knows? Cooperation on Social Security could pave the way for bipartisan solutions on everything from tax reform to Medicare, by building good will and showing that such accomplishments are possible.

HEADLINE: An Old-School Collector With Ideas on Beauty

BYLINE: By WENDY MOONAN

 BODY:
Horace Wood Brock may be a cutting-edge authority on the economics of uncertainty, but when it comes to art, he's as traditional as they come.
 He mocks all things contemporary (work he calls ''shock art'') and collects only old master drawings and European antiques.
 ''Beauty is back,'' he said defiantly, discussing his collection, which is now on view at the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston. ''Political correctness, move over.'' 
 The approximately 160 items in the show, ''Splendor and Elegance: European Decorative Arts and Drawings From the Horace Wood Brock Collection,'' begin with the Baroque and end in the neo-Classical style. The old master drawings, primarily Italian and French, date from the mid-16th to the early 19th century and include works by Rubens, Tiepolo, Fragonard, Boucher and Guercino.
 Mr. Brock, known as Woody, has been able to acquire these works over the past 30 years as a result of his success in the business world. Trained as a pianist, with advanced degrees in mathematics, economics and political philosophy, he is the founder and president of Strategic Economic Decisions, a New York company that does risk assessment for investors and governments.
 As a collector he is risk averse. His stellar collection includes a 17th-century Flemish cabinet-on-stand veneered with turtle shell, ebony and bone; an extremely rare Louis XIV Boulle longcase clock commissioned for the palace at Versailles; a Louis XVI fall-front desk by Jean-Henri Riesener; a George II japanned chinoiserie tea table; a garniture of floral Qing dynasty porcelain vases with Louis XV bronze mounts; and a Regency medals cabinet-on-stand veneered with precious woods. (His English Regency antiques have been promised to the Boston museum.) 
 Mr. Brock's definition of aesthetic beauty is based on a complex mathematical theory he developed. In the catalog he writes that beauty is present in an object ''when the right balance is achieved between order and disorder.'' 
 ''I ask myself, 'What could you change in the design that would make you like it more?' '' he said in an interview. ''If there is no way to make the design better, you know it's beautiful.'' 
 George Shackelford, the museum curator who organized the decorative arts section of the show, said: ''Mr. Brock believes that when an object treads the balance between asymmetry and symmetry in the most interesting and tense way, that is when we find it most beautiful. In that pleasure resides our concept of beauty.'' 
 For more than 30 years Mr. Brock patronized some of London's most prestigious antiques shops, including Mallett, Pelham, Hotspur and Blairman & Sons.
 ''I almost refuse to buy at auction,'' he said. ''I like to sit down with the great dealers and ask to see the best. That's how you learn quality and connoisseurship.'' 
 ''I've never had a bargain in my life,'' he added, ''but the only real bargain is quality.'' 
 PALM BEACH FAIR
 The big news at the American International Fine Arts Fair in West Palm Beach, Fla., this year is that David and Lee Ann Lester, who founded the fair in 1997, are back in charge. They sold it in 2001 and reacquired it in 2008. Experienced organizers, they know how to balance the number of dealers in paintings, decorative arts, antiquities and Asian art. (The fair is fully vetted.)
 There are a dozen specialists in European decorative arts among the 70 dealers from 13 countries participating in the high high-end fair, which opens on Wednesday and continues through Feb. 8 at the convention center in West Palm Beach.
 This year organizers are making efforts to increase attendance by Americans without neglecting the South Americans who flock to Palm Beach during the high season. 
 ''We had preview parties in New York, Chicago, Dallas and Atlanta,'' Mr. Lester said. ''We're trying to replicate the Art Basel Miami social week, with brunches, cocktail parties and private dinners. Our fair has to be social, not just shopping.'' 
 The roster of new and returning dealers includes some big guns: Pelham, Haunch of Venison, B. B. Steinitz, Wienerroither & Kohlbacher from Vienna and Carlton Hobbs from New York. (Information: aifaf.com.) 
 FAIENCE FROM PROVENCE
 To promote its fine craftsmanship the French Ministry of Culture has paired a small collection of one-of-a-kind works in crystal, steel, silver and enameled porcelain by living artists with one of Aptware, the traditional faience earthenware from Provence. The show, ''Earth and Fire: French Master Artisans and Faience From Apt,'' is at the French Institute Alliance Francaise in Manhattan through Feb. 13. 
 While the work of the contemporary artists in the show is avant-garde, it does not overwhelm the colorful faience made by the Faucon family, seven generations of ceramicists who operated a factory in Apt, a town in the Luberon Valley, from 1890 until 2002. The factory is now closed. 
 Aptware is known for its marbled look, the result of skillfully mixing various clays and firing them a secret way. It often resembles the marbled papers of Venice, though the palette is usually a blend of yellow, ocher, brown and cream. 
 ''The color depends on the amount of manganese or cobalt in the mix,'' said Mady Faucon, the widow of the last owner. ''Each member of the family wanted to imprint his own style.'' 
 In an ingenious presentation by the architect Patrick Naggar, everyday octagonal plates are placed next to giant tureens, perfume burners, chocolate pots, sugar bowls, wall fountains and vases. The Faucons invented a new flamelike faience (introduced at the Art Deco fair in Paris in 1925), along with a cobalt blue that never existed before, and laboriously attached exquisite hand-carved floral, vegetal and figurative earthenware decorations to the traditional forms. 
 The show occupies the ground-floor gallery of the institute at 22 East 60th Street. (Information: fiaf.org.)

HEADLINE: Billable Hours Giving Ground At Law Firms

BYLINE: By JONATHAN D. GLATER

 BODY:
Lawyers are having trouble defending the most basic yardstick of the legal business -- the billable hour.
 Clients have complained for years that the practice of billing for each hour worked can encourage law firms to prolong a client's problem rather than solve it. But the rough economic climate is making clients more demanding, leading many law firms to rethink their business model.
 ''This is the time to get rid of the billable hour,'' said Evan R. Chesler, presiding partner at Cravath, Swain & Moore in New York, one of a number of large firms whose most senior lawyers bill more than $800 an hour.
 ''Clients are concerned about the budgets, more so than perhaps a year or two ago,'' he added, with a lawyer's gift for understatement. 
 Big law firms are worried about their budgets, too. Deals are drying up, and only the bankruptcy business is thriving. Two top firms, Heller Ehrman and Thelen, have collapsed in recent months. Others have laid off lawyers and staff. So cost-conscious clients may now be able to sway long reluctant partners to accept alternatives.
 The evidence of a shift away from billable hours is, for now, anecdotal, as few surveys exist. But partners at a half-dozen other big bellwether firms and lawyers at corporations, who sometimes engage outside counsel, say they are more often seeing different pay arrangements. 
 Mr. Chesler, who is an advocate of the new billing practices, said that instead of paying for hours worked, more clients are paying Cravath flat fees for handling transactions and success fees for positive outcomes, as well as payments for meeting other benchmarks. He said that such arrangements were still a relatively small part of his firm's total business, but declined to discuss billable rates and prices in detail. 
 The system of billing by the hour has been firmly in place since the 1960s; keeping track of time spent provided a rationale for the amount charged. In earlier, perhaps more trusting times, firms stated a price ''for services rendered,'' without explanation. 
 But one has only to eavesdrop on a table of law associates comparing their workloads to get a sense of how entrenched the billable hour is, creating a pecking order among lawyers, identifying the best as the busiest and the most costly. 
 With a sigh that is simultaneously proud and pained, lawyers will talk about charging clients for 3,000 or more hours in a year -- a figure that means a lawyer spent about 12 hours a day of every weekday drafting motions or contracts and reviewing other lawyers' motions and contracts.
 ''Does this make any sense?'' said David B. Wilkins, professor of legal ethics and director of the program on the legal profession at Harvard. ''It makes as much sense as any other kind of effort to measure your value by some kind of objective, extrinsic measure. Which is not much.''
 To be sure, lawyers may be talking a good game but secretly hoping that the economy will bounce back and everything will return to normal, said Frederick J. Krebs, president of the Association of Corporate Counsel, whose members work in the legal departments of corporations and other organizations. He said that lawyers cheerfully lamented the bad incentives created by billable time for years, even as they grew rich from the practice.
 ''I like to paraphrase Churchill,'' Mr. Krebs said. ''In all these conversations, never has so little been accomplished by so many for so long. It just hasn't happened.''
 But the crashing economy may achieve what client complaints could not, Mr. Krebs added. ''We may well be at a tipping point here.''
 Greed may also encourage lawyers to change their payment plans. Law firms are running out of hours that they can bill in a year, said Scott F. Turow, best-selling author of legal thrillers and a partner at Sonnenschein Nath & Rosenthal in Chicago. 
 ''Firms are approaching the limit of how hard they can ask lawyers to work,'' he wrote, in an e-mail response to a reporter's query. ''Without alternative billing schemes, lawyers will not be able to maintain the rapid escalation in incomes that big firms have seen.''
 A recent study released last year by the Association of Corporate Counsel showed a rise in the number of companies paying by the hour -- but that covered the spring and summer, before the worst of the downturn.
 Many smaller firms and solo practitioners have long offered to perform services, like mortgage closings, for flat fees. Plaintiff lawyers also often work on a contingency basis, receiving a percentage of any awards.
 ''What we do in our business litigation is charge clients some kind of monthly retainer, which gets credited against an eventual recovery,'' said John G. Balestriere, a partner at Balestriere Lanza, a Manhattan firm with five lawyers. ''It's a lot easier for us to tell a client, 'We want to do this, we want to push for summary judgment,' '' he said, and so avoid a lengthy, costly trial.
 When not paid by the hour, lawyers' approach to their work changes, said Carl A. Leonard, a former chairman of Morrison & Foerster who is now a senior consultant at Hildebrandt International, which advises professional services firms. 
 In one case, he said, Morrison & Foerster negotiated a fixed fee for defending a company in court, covering work up to the point of a motion for summary judgment. 
 On top of the fee, if the case settled for less than what the company feared having to pay if it lost in court, the law firm got a percentage of the amount saved. The arrangement made sense when the goal was to resolve the dispute quickly, Mr. Leonard said. 
 Lawyers on the case negotiated a settlement for much less than the client's worst-case number, Mr. Leonard said. ''The effective hourly rate was something like 150 percent of our hourly rates,'' he added. ''We made money, the client was happy.'' 
 In litigation, firms that charge by the hour can suffer if they are too successful and end a lawsuit -- and the stream of payments from continuing work -- too quickly. One law firm that recently collapsed, Heller Ehrman, was hurt in part because a number of cases had settled.
 That collapse highlights the risk to law firms experimenting with other payment arrangements: If lawyers set too low a price, they lose money. Many lawyers may not be good enough businessmen to pick the right price, said Mr. Krebs, of the Association of Corporate Counsel. 
 ''The difficulty is, we don't really know what it costs us to do something,'' he said. But the biggest stumbling block to alternative fee structures may be the managing partners at law firms, who will have to overhaul compensation structures to reward partners and associates for something other than taking a long time to do something. 
 ''I don't think law firms have completely come to grips with that issue,'' said J. Stephen Poor, managing partner at Seyfarth Shaw in Chicago. ''But they need to start coming to grips with it very quickly.''

PERSON: Roy A. Somlyo 

HEADLINE: Roy A. Somlyo, 83, Theater Producer

BYLINE: By DENNIS HEVESI

 BODY:
Roy A. Somlyo, who in a 50-year career in the theater produced or managed more than 100 shows on Broadway, in London or on tour and who was managing producer of the annual Tony Awards telecast for more than a decade, died Thursday in Manhattan. He was 83 and lived in Manhattan.
 The cause was cancer, his daughter, Lauren McGowan, said. 
 Among the notable shows that Mr. Somlyo brought, or helped bring, to Broadway were the comedy ''6 Rms Riv Vu'' in 1972; a revival of Eugene O'Neill's ''Anna Christie'' in 1977; the musical adaptation of ''I Remember Mama,'' from Richard Rodgers, Martin Charnin and Thomas Meehan, in 1979; the musical comedy ''A Day in Hollywood/A Night in the Ukraine'' in 1980; and the drama ''84 Charing Cross Road'' in 1982. 
 Besides pursuing his prolific theater career, Mr. Somlyo produced many television specials, including ''Salute to the Tonys,'' ''Night of 100 Stars'' and ''Your Money or Your Wife.'' He shared four Emmys for outstanding variety, music or comedy specials: three for the Tony Awards shows in 1980, 1998 and 1999 and one for the ''Night of 100 Stars'' in 1982.
 Through much of his career, Mr. Somlyo was a general manager or an associate producer for Alexander H. Cohen, one of Broadway's last old-time independent producers. Mr. Cohen, who died in 2000, took Mr. Somlyo along with him when he took over production of the Tony Awards in 1967. That year, for the first time, the ceremony was broadcast nationally on ABC. Until then it had been shown only in New York City on the DuMont network. In 1987 Mr. Somlyo became managing producer of the Tony Awards show, a post he held until 1998. 
 ''He was the guy from the past who was ready to take it into the future,'' Ted Chapin, chairman of the American Theater Wing, said of Mr. Somlyo. (The American Theater Wing and the Broadway League are partners in Tony Awards Productions.)
 ''Roy kept the ceremony theatrical,'' Mr. Chapin said, ''because the one thing that can differentiate the Tonys from the Emmys or the Oscars is what happens between the presentation of the awards.'' 
 Sometimes Mr. Somlyo trucked in the entire set from a running production, Mr. Chapin said; sometimes he left the stage bare; and other times ''he used a panoply of Broadway stars doing the numbers they had made famous over the years.''
 In 2007 Mr. Somlyo received the Theater Hall of Fame Founders Award. 
 Born in Detroit on Sept. 2, 1925, he was the youngest of five children of Ben and Irma Knopfler Somlyo. Besides his daughter, he is survived by his wife of 51 years, the former Nancy Rifici; two sisters, Caroline Miller and Emily Somlyo; a son, David; and four grandchildren.
 After graduating from high school, Mr. Somlyo served in the Army in World War II. He returned to Detroit and earned a bachelor's degree in economics at Wayne State University. While in college, he and some friends formed their own theater group. He was hooked. 
 Economics degree notwithstanding, Mr. Somlyo moved to New York to find theater work, then went into summer stock on Cape Cod. It became a full-curriculum theater education. 
 ''In the mornings and afternoons I sold tickets,'' he told The New York Sun in 2006. ''Then I collected tickets at the door. Then I moved scenery on the stage. At times it was necessary to do walk-on roles. Then at the end of the show I painted scenery for the next show. Early the next morning I distributed posters, fliers and advertisements. Then I helped the theater pay its bills.''
 Back in New York that fall, he was hired as a gofer by the legendary producer David Merrick.

HEADLINE: A Rich Income in '06 Was $263 Million

BYLINE: By LYNNLEY BROWNING

 BODY:
The income of the 400 wealthiest Americans swelled in 2006, soaring nearly 23 percent from the previous year, to an average of $263 million, according to data released Thursday by the Internal Revenue Service. Since 1996, this group has nearly doubled its share of all income earned in the United States. 
 The top 400 paid just more than $18 billion in federal income taxes in 2006, or an average of $45 million, on a record $105 billion in total income -- the lowest effective tax rate in the 15 years since the agency began releasing such data.
 That compares with nearly $1 trillion paid by all other individual taxpayers in 2006. 
 The gains for the richest took place amid a booming economy, in which hedge funds and private equity firms blossomed and the subprime lending machine went into high gear. 
 The rising wealth of the nation's richest taxpayers will most likely intensify debate among tax and policy analysts about the equitability of the tax code, which analysts say favors the ultrawealthy. 
 Tax cuts enacted by the Bush administration that benefit the wealthy are set to expire by 2011. 
 ''Until recently, we had a financial system that rewarded investors, and we have a tax system that does as well,'' said Robert S. McIntyre, the director of Citizens for Tax Justice.
 Now wealthy people, he said, pay income tax rates well below those of working-class citizens because of a myriad of tax breaks. A lower capital gains tax, now at 15 percent, down from 28 percent in 1997, benefits investors with big portfolios.
 The average adjusted gross income in 2006 of more than $263 million for the top 400 taxpayers compared with an average of $214 million in 2005. It was three and a half times what they earned in 1996, which was $74 million.
 And their average tax rate continued to a 15-year low of 17 percent.
 But their contribution to federal coffers rose slightly, to nearly 1.8 percent of total contributions by all individual taxpayers. About 130 million taxpayers file returns each year.
 The growth in income came primarily from dividends and interest income, not rising salaries and wages. Capital gains income jumped to 63 percent of the adjusted gross income of the richest 400, up from 58 percent in the previous year. 
 As a percentage of their income, salaries and wages fell to 7.4 percent of their total income, down from more than 12.5 percent just two years earlier. But taxable interest as a percentage of their income rose to nearly 7.8 percent, the highest level since the dot-com boom era of 1995. 
 The higher income also came from a sharp rise in claims for foreign tax credits, typically through privately owned entities. Such claims rose in 2006 to an average $2.5 million from $1.7 million the year earlier, and quadruple the level in 1996.
 More than half, or nearly 54 percent, of all the itemized deductions taken by the wealthiest were related to their charitable contributions, a figure roughly unchanged since 1996.
 And while the top 400 wealthiest earned more deductions from their charitable contributions, such gifts still account for just 5.19 percent of all itemized charitable contributions by all taxpayers.

FILM SERIES
 JACQUES DOILLON: L'EMOTION (Tuesday) A two-month series of Tuesday screenings devoted to the work of Mr. Doillon -- one of the most creative members of the generation of French filmmakers that emerged in the aftermath of the New Wave -- begins with a double bill. Anne Brochet and Francoise Dumas's 1998 documentary, ''Jacques Doillon: Words and Emotion,'' is paired with Mr. Doillon's 1985 ''Family Life,'' a vivid, messy account of a father (Sami Frey) and his attempts to repair his relationship with his 10-year-old daughter (Mara Goyet) from his first marriage. At 12:30, 4 and 7:30 p.m., French Institute/Alliance Francaise, Gould Hall, 55 East 59th Street, Manhattan, (212) 355-6100, fiaf.org, $10. (Dave Kehr) 
 'FTA' (Monday) Jane Fonda will be present for a discussion after this rare screening of Francine Parker's 1972 documentary, which follows Ms. Fonda, Donald Sutherland, Holly Near and other performers on a sort of alternative-U.S.O. tour of military bases in the United States and around the Pacific rim. The title stands either for ''Free the Army'' or a saltier expression, depending on the context. At 7 p.m., IFC Center, 323 Avenue of the Americas, at Third Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 924-7771, ifccenter.com; $15. (Kehr) 
 GREAT FILMS OF 1939 (Sunday) As part of Symphony Space's cultural survey, ''The 1939 Project,'' a series of films drawn from that banner year in movie history begins with Ernst Lubitsch's political comedy ''Ninotchka'' (at 2 and 7 p.m.) and the social documentary ''The City'' (at 4:30 p.m.), directed by Ralph Steiner and Willard Van Dyke. Symphony Space, 2537 Broadway, at 95th Street, (212) 864-5400, symphonyspace.org; $11. (Kehr)
 ANGELA RICCI LUCCHI AND YERVANT GIANIKIAN, A RETROSPECTIVE (Monday and Wednesday) Based in Turin, Italy, Ms. Lucchi and Mr. Gianikian have been creating stunning and often disturbing montage films based on ''found'' newsreel, travelogue and medical footage. They include subjects like the wages of colonialism; the aftermath of war; the essence of fascist ideology; and the various pseudo-sciences human beings have invented to enslave themselves. The filmmakers will be present for Monday's 7 p.m. screening of their recent ''Ghiro ghiro tondo,'' which explores the war-torn terrain of the Dolomite region in northeast Italy through images of broken toys. They will also attend Wednesday's 8 p.m. presentation of the early (1981) ''Karagoez: Catalogue 9.5,'' which samples and reassembles a collection of 9.5-millimeter show-at-home movies assembled between 1900 and 1928. Museum of Modern Art Roy and Niuta Titus Theaters, (212) 708-9400, moma.org; $10. (Kehr)
 MOVIES
 Ratings and running times are in parentheses; foreign films have English subtitles. Full reviews of all current releases, movie trailers, showtimes and tickets: nytimes.com/movies.
 'AUSTRALIA' (PG-13, 2:35) Baz Luhrmann's creation story about modern Australia is a pastiche of genres and references wrapped up into one horse-galloping, cattle-stampeding, camera-swooping, music-swelling widescreen package. Hugh Jackman gives the film oomph; a wonderfully expressive Nicole Kidman gives it a performance. (Manohla Dargis)
 'BEDTIME STORIES' (PG, 1:38) ''I don't believe in happy endings,'' says Skeeter (Adam Sandler), a resentful hotel handyman, to his young niece and nephew. Luckily his director, Adam Shankman, loves them, dragging Skeeter and the rest of the cast through a variety of threadbare fantasies -- an Old West showdown, a medieval joust -- that fail to juice a movie soured by uninspired writing and an enervated star. And if there were an Oscar for miscasting, Guy Pearce's atrocious turn as the hotel's pompous manager would be a lock. (Jeannette Catsoulis) 
 'BRIDE WARS' (PG, 1:34) Die, Bridezilla, die! (Dargis) 
 'CADILLAC RECORDS' (R, 1:48) This rollicking and insightful celebration of Chicago blues serves as a group portrait of a remarkable, volatile constellation of artists, including Muddy Waters (the impressive Jeffrey Wright), Chuck Berry (Mos Def) and Etta James (Beyonce Knowles). This movie is crowded and sprawling, and if it rambles sometimes, that's just fine. (A. O. Scott)
 'CALIFORNIA DREAMIN' ' (No rating, 2:35, in Romanian, English, Spanish and Italian) When the Romanian director Cristian Nemescu died in 2006 at 27, he left behind a handful of brilliant shorts and this feature, which won a prize in Cannes the next year. Longer than it might have been had he lived to trim it, the movie is an incisive satire of cultural collision. In 1999 a company of American soldiers (led by Armand Assante) is stranded in a Romanian backwater on its way to Kosovo, and the men's sojourn is marked by sex, violence, chaos, absurdity and a queasy sense of the pleasures and catastrophes of an American-dominated global order. (Scott) 
 'CHANDNI CHOWK TO CHINA' (PG-13, 2:20, in Hindi, Cantonese and Mandarin) The immensely popular Akshay Kumar stars in this genial mash-up of Bollywood and kung fu. Too frantic at the beginning, ''Chandni'' settles down to become an enjoyable if slight Saturday matinee picture. It was financed and distributed by Warner Brothers, a first for Bollywood. (Rachel Saltz) 
 'CHE' (R, 4:17, in Spanish and English) Nearly four and a half hours long and spanning more than a decade, ''Che'' surely deserves the overworked, frequently misapplied label of epic. But it's a narrow epic, and while Benicio Del Toro, in the title role, offers a performance that's technically flawless, the movie is politically naive and dramatically inert. (Scott)
 'THE CLASS' (No rating, 2:08, in French, with English subtitles) An artful, intelligent, heartfelt fiction film from the director Laurent Cantet about modern French identity and the attempt to transform young students of all sizes, shapes and colors into citizens through talk, talk, talk. (Dargis)
 'CRIPS AND BLOODS: MADE IN AMERICA' (No rating, 1:45) The director Stacy Peralta tracks the history of violent Los Angeles gangs with heart in his well-intended documentary, but not enough intellectual skepticism. (Dargis)
 'THE CURIOUS CASE OF BENJAMIN BUTTON' (PG-13, 2:47) A hothouse blossom of romance, intrigue and breathtaking digital effects from David Fincher (''Zodiac,'' ''Fight Club''). Brad Pitt stars as a man who ages backward, but it is Cate Blanchett who provides the film's delicate, graceful emotional center of gravity. (Scott) 
 'DOUBT' (PG-13, 1:44) Adapted by John Patrick Shanley from his stage play, this drama about a Roman Catholic priest suspected of child molestation stars a tamped-down Philip Seymour Hoffman as the accused and an energetic, often wackily comic Meryl Streep as his accuser. (Dargis) 
 'FROST/NIXON' (R, 2:02) It's twinkle (Michael Sheen) versus glower (Frank Langella) in Ron Howard's amusing, facile edition of the Peter Morgan theatrical smackdown. (Dargis)
 'FROZEN RIVER' (R, 1:37) Venturing deep into the trenches where hard-working Americans struggle to put food on the table, Courtney Hunt's powerful, somber film evokes a perfect storm of present-day economic and social woes. Playing an impoverished mother of two who smuggles illegal aliens across the Canadian border, Melissa Leo gives an awards-worthy performance. (Stephen Holden)
 'GRAN TORINO' (R, 1:56) Once again Clint Eastwood shows everyone how it's done, with a sleek muscle car of a movie set in that industrial graveyard called Detroit about a racist who befriends a besieged Hmong family next door. (Dargis)
 'HAPPY-GO-LUCKY' (R, 1:58) Happiness is a complicated, difficult matter, and for the bopping bloom at the center of Mike Leigh's generous, expansive new film -- a gurgling stream of giggles, laughs and words played by a glorious Sally Hawkins -- it's also a question of faith. (Dargis)
 'HOTEL FOR DOGS' (PG, 1:40) Children and dogs: those two magic words distill the appeal of this cuter-than-cute, sweeter-than-sweet family film about animal-loving kids who embark on a crusade to rescue all the stray pooches in a fictional city. (Holden)
 'INKHEART' (PG, 1:43) A movie about books coming to life that never manages to do so itself. (Scott) 
 'JUST ANOTHER LOVE STORY' (No rating, 1:40, in Danish) As this twisty Danish thriller zigzags between austere realism and surreal gore, you have the not unpleasant sense of being taken for a ride. It may not go anywhere in particular, but it is as exciting as a trip through a well-equipped, scary fun house. (Holden) 
 'LAST CHANCE HARVEY' (PG, 1:38) Dustin Hoffman and Emma Thompson don't make a lot of sense as a screen couple, but there's something irresistible about watching two people fall in love, even in contrived, sniffle- and sometimes gag-inducing films like this one. (Dargis)
 'LET THE RIGHT ONE IN' (No rating, 1:54, in Swedish) A charming and chilling Swedish love story directed by Tomas Alfredson about a lonely boy and the girl next door who may just happen to be a vampire. (Dargis)
 'MAN ON WIRE' (PG-13, 1:34) Philippe Petit's 1974 tightrope walk between the towers of the World Trade Center might have seemed, at the time, like a crazy stunt, but James Marsh's beautiful documentary understands it as a work of art. (Scott)
 'MARLEY AND ME' (PG, 2:05) The bland, obsequious screen adaptation of John Grogan's best-selling 2005 memoir of his up-and-down relationship with an unruly Labrador retriever has a surefire tear-jerker ending. But the bond between human and pet and what they can learn from each other remains unexplored. (Holden) 
 'MILK' (R, 2:08) Gus Van Sant's film about Harvey Milk (1930-78), the San Francisco City supervisor who was one of the first openly gay elected officials in the country, is less a standard biopic than a sharp, lyrical history lesson, touching not only on a crucial decade in the gay-rights movement but also on the rough and tumble of big-city politics and the tricky ways of love. Sean Penn outdoes himself as Milk, balancing his intense conviction with an unusual and welcome playfulness. The large supporting cast is also excellent, and includes James Franco as Milk's lover and campaign manager, Scott Smith, and Josh Brolin as Dan White, Milk's colleague on the Board of Supervisors and also his murderer. (Scott)
 'MOSCOW, BELGIUM' (No rating, 1:42, in Flemish) You may have observed the characters' banal situations in countless other movies, not to mention in your own life, but it is unusual to find them explored with such matter-of-fact truthfulness. (Holden)
 'MY BLOODY VALENTINE 3D' (R, 1:41) Adding an extra dimension to the fondly remembered 1981 Canadian slasher about a rogue slayer in a small mining town, ''My Bloody Valentine 3D'' blends cutting-edge technology and old-school prosthetics to produce gore you can believe in. And if the gas-masked villain is less than terrifying, his pursuit of a naked young woman (Betsy Rue) is inspired. If there were an award for acting full-frontally while wearing sky-high stilettos, Ms. Rue would surely teeter away with it. (Catsoulis) 
 'NOT EASILY BROKEN' (PG-13, 1:39) Directed by Bill Duke and based on a novel by the megachurch minister T. D. Jakes, this story of a marriage under stress is hokey and sometimes clumsy, but anchored in an earnest engagement with the lives of its characters, who have the good fortune of being portrayed by a fine cast. (Scott)
 'NOTORIOUS' (R, 2:02) The legend of Biggie Smalls, the Brooklyn-born rapper who was murdered in 1997, is given the full epic-melodrama-biopic treatment in this uneven, rarely dull film, among whose producers are Smalls's mother, Violetta Wallace, and his friend and mentor Sean Combs. Those two important figures are played by Angela Bassett and Derek Luke, while Smalls is impersonated by Jamal Woolard, whose faithful mimicry compensates for some of his limitations as an actor. (Scott)
 'OF TIME AND THE CITY' (No rating, 1:14) Terrence Davies's first documentary is a lyrical, barbed reminiscence of postwar Liverpool, in which the nostalgic charm of archival footage flickers in tense counterpoint with Mr. Davies's rueful, barbed narration. (Scott) 
 'PAUL BLART: MALL COP' (PG, 1:30) Fat people are funny. Fat people who run into things are funnier. Fat people who run into things and have humiliating working-class jobs? Stop, you're killing me! (Nathan Lee)
 'RACHEL GETTING MARRIED' (R, 1:54) Anne Hathaway plays Kym, furloughed from rehab to attend her sister Rachel's wedding. The director, Jonathan Demme, working from a script by Jenny Lumet, takes a fairly conventional family-therapy drama and packs it with exuberant vitality. There is ample sorrow and recrimination at this party, but nonetheless you'll be sorry when it ends. (Scott)
 'THE READER' (R, 2:03) You have to wonder who, exactly, wants or perhaps needs to see another movie about the Holocaust that embalms its horrors with artfully spilled tears and also asks us to pity a death camp guard. Kate Winslet plays the guard; Stephen Daldry directs. (Dargis)
 'REVOLUTIONARY ROAD' (R, 1:59) Sam Mendes directs Kate Winslet and a fine Leonardo DiCaprio in a waxworks edition of the corrosive, furiously unsentimental novel by Richard Yates about an unhappy marriage in the mid-1950s. (Dargis)
 'SLUMDOG MILLIONAIRE' (R, 2:00) A modern fairy tale from Danny Boyle (''Trainspotting'') about a pauper angling to become a prince, this sensory blowout largely takes place amid the squalor of Mumbai, India, where lost children and dogs sift through trash so fetid that you swear you can smell the discarded mango as well as its peel. (Dargis)
 'SYNECDOCHE, NEW YORK' (R, 2:04) To say that Charlie Kaufman's feature debut is one of the best films of the year or even the one closest to my heart is such a pathetic response to its soaring ambition that I might as well pack it in right now. (In other words: Go!) (Dargis)
 'TELL NO ONE' (No rating, 2:05, in French) In the shortcut language of a movie pitch, Guillaume Canet's delicious contemporary thriller is ''Vertigo'' meets ''The Fugitive'' by way of ''The Big Sleep.'' This French adaptation of Harlan Coben's 2001 best seller (same name) is the kind of conspiracy-minded mystery almost no one seems capable of creating anymore, except David Lynch in his surreal way. Beautifully written and acted, it is a labyrinth in which to get deliriously lost. (Holden)
 'TROUBLE THE WATER' (No rating, 1:33) While making this superb documentary about that natural and unnatural disaster, Hurricane Katrina, the filmmakers Carl Deal and Tia Lessin hit the jackpot when they meet two New Orleans survivors, Kimberly and Scott Roberts, who rode out the storm with a video camera. (Dargis)
 'THE UNBORN' (PG-13, 1:40) There's a dybbuk loose, and Gary Oldman is the rabbi who must stop it. (Dargis)
 'UNDERWORLD: RISE OF THE LYCANS' (R, 1:32) Michael Sheen howls up a storm in this prehistory to the first two ''Underworld'' flicks, which rewinds to when the werewolves rebelled against their vampire masters. (Dargis) 
 'VALKYRIE' (PG-13, 2:00) Bryan Singer (''X-Men'') directs this slick, facile action flick about the heroic Claus von Stauffenberg, a Third Reich officer who made several attempts to assassinate Hitler. Tom Cruise plays the hero with his usual vigor and an eye patch. (Dargis)
 'VICKY CRISTINA BARCELONA' (PG-13, 1:36) A rueful comedy from Woody Allen about two young American women (Scarlett Johansson and Rebecca Hall) who, during a summertime European idyll, savor numerous Continental delicacies, some provided by the equally alluring Javier Bardem and Penelope Cruz. (Dargis)
 'WALTZ WITH BASHIR' (R, 1:27) Ari Folman's animated documentary about Israeli soldiers haunted by memories of the 1982 Lebanon war is part memoir, part dream, part combat picture and altogether amazing. (Scott)
 'WENDY AND LUCY' (R, 1:20) In Kelly Reichardt's latest film Michelle Williams plays Wendy, a lonely young woman who encounters a run of bad luck while drifting through Oregon and Washington with her dog, Lucy. At first glance the film seems like little more than an extended anecdote, but underneath this plain narrative surface is a lucid and melancholy inquiry into the current state of American society. (Scott) 
 'THE WRESTLER' (R, 1:45) Mickey Rourke, with sly, hulking grace, stars as a washed-up wrestler hoping for a comeback. But like its hero, the movie has a blunt, exuberant honesty, pulling off even its false moves with conviction and flair. (Scott) 
 'YES MAN' (PG-13, 1:44) When a grouchy curmudgeon (Jim Carrey) visits a self-help seminar preaching the power of yes, he is transformed into a wild, unpredictable fellow; a giddy, spontaneous goofball; a gangling, motormouthed, rubber-faced id. Nothing we haven't seen before, and not terribly inspired. (Scott)

HEADLINE: Latest Reports Indicate Economy Is Getting Worse

BYLINE: By JACK HEALY

 BODY:
Thursday brought a hat trick of grim economic news: New-home sales fell to their slowest pace on record, businesses cut their orders and jobless claims continued to rise. 
 Taken together, the three reports released by the government painted a picture of an economy that continued to slide as falling consumer spending and rising unemployment amplified the effects of a yearlong recession.
 The Commerce Department reported that American businesses ordered fewer durable goods like computers, construction equipment and vehicles in December, cutting the prospects for growth as companies braced for a difficult 2009.
 Orders of durable goods fell 2.6 percent last month, to $176.8 billion. It was the fifth consecutive month of declines, after a 3.7 percent drop in November as the country slipped deeper into a recession now nearly 13 months old.
 Excluding transportation, new orders of durable goods orders fell 3.6 percent. Excluding orders for military equipment, durable goods fell 4.9 percent.
 For all of 2008, orders fell 5.7 percent, a decline topped only by a 10.7 percent drop in 2001.
 ''This is pretty much what you expect when the economy is in the process of shrinking and businesses don't see any need to purchase any capital goods,'' said Bernard Baumohl, managing director of the Economic Outlook Group. ''Even if you did want to increase your capital investments, it's going to be difficult to get the capital to purchase this.''
 Orders for computers and electronic goods dropped by 7.2 percent in December, and factory orders for metals, machinery, transportation equipment and communications equipment slumped as businesses cut their outlooks.
 Shipment of goods also fell for a fifth month, declining 0.7 percent.
 ''The data show clear declines in sectors as diverse as cars, computers, metals and machinery,'' Ian C. Shepherdson, chief United States economist at High Frequency Economics, wrote in a note. ''The industrial recession is deep and broad, and there's no prospect of any easing of the downward pressure anytime soon.''
 As businesses struggled, the problems of the housing market continued to multiply. The Commerce Department reported that sales of new single-family homes in December fell 14.7 percent to an annual rate of 331,000, a record low. 
 In all, 482,000 new homes were sold last year as housing prices tumbled and credit dried up. That figure was 37.8 percent lower than the 776,000 homes sold a year earlier.
 Also on Thursday, the Labor Department reported that first-time unemployment claims rose to a seasonally adjusted 588,000 for the week that ended Jan. 24, up 3,000 from a revised 585,000 for the week before.
 Employers had long resisted making mass layoffs as the economy cooled, seeking instead to cut costs through shorter work weeks, pay cuts and hiring freezes, but they are now cutting jobs by the thousands.
 The national unemployment rate has risen to 7.2 percent since the economy slipped into recession last December, and the jobless rates in Michigan and Rhode Island have already reached 10 percent. Some economists expect that the national unemployment rate will rise to 9 percent before the economy gets back on track.

HEADLINE: Union Sees Gains in N.F.L. Bottom Line

BYLINE: By JUDY BATTISTA

DATELINE: TAMPA, Fla. 

 BODY:
After a contentious search process, N.F.L. players will select a new union chief in six weeks, and that's when the real contentions will begin.
 The union said here Thursday that a study it commissioned showed that teams made an average profit of at least $24 million last year, even though owners, who have opted out of the existing labor agreement, have claimed that the financial crisis is squeezing their margins, and has caused some teams and the league office to lay off employees. 
 Players receive about 60 percent of revenue, a figure that owners said was untenable when they opted out of the agreement last spring, only two years after the deal was struck.
 ''The bottom line for players is they want to retain and improve upon what they already have in the collective bargaining agreement,'' said Richard Berthelsen, the union's acting executive director. ''Football is a very good business. The revenue pie has continued to grow. The players see no reason why their slice of that pie should be any smaller in the future.'' 
 The 2009 season will be the final one with a salary cap unless a new deal is reached before the next league year begins in March 2010. Gene Upshaw, the union's longtime executive director, died last August. Berthelsen said the league had told him that it would make no new offer in negotiations until the union selected Upshaw's successor. 
 If a new deal is not reached before the start of the 2010 league year, the 2010 season will be played with no cap. Kevin Mawae, the union's president, on Thursday reiterated one of Upshaw's central bargaining positions: that if the cap ever goes, players would never accept it again. Mawae said a system without a cap could only benefit players, but the lack of an agreement could also end with a doomsday scenario: a lockout that would test the resolve of players to stick together.

HEADLINE: For Refugees, Recession Makes Hard Times Even Harder

BYLINE: By ERIK ECKHOLM

DATELINE: SALT LAKE CITY 

 BODY:
After escaping violence in Burma and spending 27 years in the bamboo huts of a United Nations camp in Thailand, Nyaw Paw, 33, arrived in the United States last August to face the traumatic adjustment and cultural vertigo known to every refugee.
 But with high rents, lagging federal aid and now a recession that is drying up entry-level work, the transition has become harder than ever, refugee workers say. Overwhelming housing costs are its starkest symptom. Many new arrivals spend 90 percent or more of their income on rent and utilities, leaving them virtually no disposable income and creating enormous hardships. 
 Ms. Nyaw Paw, who was placed in Salt Lake City with her two sons, ages 6 and 13, has scraped together the $600 rent on their one-bedroom apartment from federal payments that ended in December. Now, her only income is a welfare grant of about $500 a month; a private aid agency fills the gap. 
 Ms. Nyaw Paw has tried for traditional starter jobs, like motel housekeeping, but no one is hiring here. Her life demands such frugality that she washes the family clothes in the bathtub rather than feeding quarters to the machine down the hall. 
 ''I think about the rent every minute,'' Ms. Nyaw Paw said through a translator, ''and I don't know what I'll do when the aid programs run out.''
 Poor refugees -- like low-income Americans -- can apply for rent subsidies, which require that recipients spend 30 percent of their income on rent, with the federal government picking up the rest. But in Salt Lake City, there is a two-year waiting list, and it is longer in many other cities. 
 Starting in February, in the first program of its kind, Utah plans to soften the huge and growing burden of housing costs by providing rent subsidies to recently arrived families for up to two years. The money is being drawn from unspent federal welfare reserves. Under the welfare reforms of 1996, states can use the federal grant flexibly for families that already qualify for welfare, mainly single-parent families like Ms. Nyaw Paw's. For them, such help will make a world of difference.
 Refugees arrive in the United States with a one-time State Department grant of about $450 a person and temporary help from a private agency to assist them toward economic self-sufficiency. 
 Apart from a number of Iraqis who arrive with professional degrees, most refugees these days arrive from Africa and Asia with little education or experience of Western life, and no relatives in this country to help. 
 Federal aid for refugee resettlement has not risen with the cost of living, state welfare programs are skimpier than before and low-income housing is ever scarcer. Meanwhile, the jobs that refugees have often ridden to success, like working in warehouses and hotels, are disappearing or being filled by people laid off from other jobs. 
 ''People are hurting here, often spending 85 to 90 percent of their incomes or more on rent, and they can hardly do anything else,'' said Gerald Brown, who was recently appointed Utah's first director of refugee services. 
 Utah takes in about 1,000 refugees a year, and recently they included a preponderance of Burmese, Nepali Bhutanese, Iraqis and Somalis. During home visits to four families, Mr. Brown said, he found to his dismay that none had the heat on, saving on utility bills in this chilly city among snow-covered mountains; babies and grandparents alike wore heavy coats and wool hats.
 The International Rescue Committee, one of 10 private groups that the State Department pays to usher refugees through their first months, has provided some furniture, toys and basics like detergent. Food stamps enable them to eat. But Ms. Nyaw Paw's older boy has begged in vain for a computer; other families with infants say they cannot afford diapers, and many of the thousands of refugees living in Salt Lake City cannot even think about going to a movie. 
 Utah will also use part of its welfare fund to enable the International Rescue Committee and Catholic Community Services to provide advice and emergency aid to families for two years, rather than the current six months, which has proved too brief for many dislocated arrivals. 
 ''The most vulnerable time for refugees is the first year or two,'' said Patrick Poulin, local resettlement director for the International Rescue Committee. ''A good number make it on their own over time, but these new programs will accelerate that.'' 
 The housing plan has drawn no significant opposition in Utah, which is generally seen as friendly to refugees. But the size of the American refugee program, which admitted about 60,000 people last year and is widely regarded as advancing humanitarian and foreign policy goals, has been questioned by some. Critics say the United States allows in too many people who are surely going to require public aid yet have alternative places to live -- for example, Ms. Nyaw Paw, by this argument, could have remained in Thailand. 
 ''We are much too permissive about letting refugees in,'' said Mark Krikorian, executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies, a research group that favors reducing immigration. 
 Refugee admissions, Mr. Krikorian said, should be held ''to the very small number of people who don't have and won't have any place else to go.'' 
 Once people are admitted, he said, they should receive the necessary help, and he had no problem with Utah's new rental aid. 
 Lul Omar of Somalia, who keeps her head covered by a scarf and her fingertips dark with henna, is scraping by in Salt Lake City. After seeing her husband killed in their home, she fled to Saudi Arabia and then to a United Nations camp in Egypt. She and her seven children, a lanky crew ages 4 to 15, arrived here in October 2007. 
 The International Rescue Committee helped Ms. Omar find an older, small four-bedroom house, which she has decorated with a few plastic flowers. The monthly rent of $1,095, she said, ''is the biggest problem I have.'' 
 She works eight hours a day, at $6 an hour, putting price stickers on used clothing at Deseret Industries, a Mormon Church version of Good Will Industries. To get there from her home, she must take two buses and a tram, more than an hour each way. She is grateful for the work, but her slender earnings caused her welfare payment to drop, to $385 a month. 
 ''We can't buy clothing or even soap,'' Ms. Omar said, explaining that she relies on charity for such necessities. 
 ''I feel so bad,'' Ms. Omar said. ''The kids are always asking me for a little bit of money so they can buy a soda after school, but usually I don't have any.'' 
 Ms. Nyaw Paw, an ethnic Karen who still wears blouses she embroidered in the Thai camp, recently learned that the new rent-aid program could give her a few hundred dollars more each month, reinforcing the reasons she applied to come to the United States in the first place: to give her children opportunities. 
 ''If I got that extra money,'' she said, ''I'd save it in the bank, for the kids when they get older.'' 
 Acknowledging the forced drabness of life today, she added that the money would provide a few comforts. ''Maybe they'll want to go out with friends,'' she said.

HEADLINE: Totally Tolerant, Up to A Point

BYLINE: By IAN BURUMA. 
Ian Buruma is the author of ''Murder in Amsterdam: The Death of Theo van Gogh and the Limits of Tolerance.''

 BODY:
IF it were not for his hatred of Islam, Geert Wilders would have remained a provincial Dutch parliamentarian of little note. 
 He is now world-famous, mainly for wanting the Koran to be banned in his country, ''like Mein Kampf is banned,'' and for making a crude short film that depicted Islam as a terrorist faith -- or, as he puts it, ''that sick ideology of Allah and Muhammad.'' 
 Last year the Dutch government decided that such views, though coarse, were an acceptable contribution to political debate. Yet last week an Amsterdam court decided that Mr. Wilders should be prosecuted for ''insulting'' and ''spreading hatred'' against Muslims. Dutch criminal law can be invoked against anyone who ''deliberately insults people on the grounds of their race, religion, beliefs or sexual orientation.'' 
 Whether Mr. Wilders has deliberately insulted Muslim people is for the judges to decide. But for a man who calls for a ban on the Koran to act as the champion of free speech is a bit rich. When the British Parliament refused to screen Mr. Wilders's film at Westminster this week, he cited this as ''yet more proof that Europe is losing its freedom.'' His defenders, by no means all right-wingers, also claim to be standing up for freedom. A Dutch law professor said he found it ''strange'' that a man should be prosecuted for ''criticizing a book.''
 This seems a trifle obtuse. Comparing a book that billions hold sacred to Hitler's murderous tract is more than an exercise in literary criticism; it suggests that those who believe in the Koran are like Nazis, and an all-out war against them would be justified. This kind of thinking, presumably, is what the Dutch law court is seeking to check. 
 One of the misconceptions that muddle the West's debate over Islam and free speech is the idea that people should be totally free to insult. Free speech is never that absolute. Even -- or perhaps especially -- in America, where citizens are protected by the First Amendment, there are certain words and opinions that no civilized person would utter, and others that open the speaker to civil charges. 
 This does not mean that religious beliefs should be above criticism. And sometimes criticism will be taken as an insult where none is intended. In that case the critic should get the benefit of the doubt. Likening the Koran to ''Mein Kampf'' would not seem to fall into that category. 
 If Mr. Wilders were to confine his remarks to those Muslims who do harm freedom of speech by using violence against critics and apostates, he would have a valid point. This is indeed a serious problem, not just in the West, but especially in countries where Muslims are in the majority. Mr. Wilders, however, refuses to make such fine distinctions. He believes that there is no such thing as a moderate Muslim. His aim is to stop ''the Islamic invasion of Holland.''
 There are others who share this fear and speak of ''Islamicization,'' as though not just Holland but all Europe were in danger of being engulfed by fascism once again. Since Muslims still constitute a relatively small minority, and most are not extremists, this seems an exaggerated fear, even though the danger of Islamist violence must be taken seriously. 
 However, a closer look at the rhetoric of Mr. Wilders and his defenders shows that Muslims are not the only enemies in their sights. Equally dangerous are the people whom Mr. Wilders and others refer to obsessively as ''the cultural elite.'' 
 What they mean are liberals who are so concerned about Western racism that they find it hard to tolerate any criticism of non-Western people or non-Western faiths. There are such people, to be sure, but even among my fellow Dutch citizens political correctitude of this kind is becoming increasingly rare.
 In the past, it is true, legitimate debates about cultural and religious tensions arising from the poor integration of ethnic minorities were often stifled by an excess of liberal zeal. Doubts about the official drive toward pan-European unity and over liberal policies over guest workers and refugees were too often dismissed as ultra-nationalism or worse. 
 In a bewildering world of global economics, multinational institutions and mass migration, many people are anxious about losing their sense of place; they feel abandoned by their own elites. Right-wing populists like Geert Wilders are tapping into these fears. 
 Since raw nativism is out of fashion in the Netherlands, Mr. Wilders does not speak of race, but of freedom. His method is to expose the intolerance of Muslims by provoking them. If they react to his insults, he can claim that they are a threat to our native liberties. And if anyone should point out that deliberately giving offense to Muslims is neither the best way to lower social tensions nor to protect our freedoms, Mr. Wilders will denounce him as a typical cultural elitist collaborating with ''Islamo-fascism.'' 
 The lawsuit against Mr. Wilders has been hailed in the Netherlands as a good thing for democracy. I am not so sure. It makes him look more important than he should be. In fact, the response of Dutch Muslims to his film last year was exemplary: most said nothing at all. And when a small Dutch Muslim TV station offered to broadcast the film, after all other stations had refused, the grand champion of free speech resolutely turned the offer down.

HEADLINE: M.T.A. Planning to Spend Stimulus on Fulton St. Hub

BYLINE: By WILLIAM NEUMAN

 BODY:
The Metropolitan Transportation Authority expects to spend $497 million in federal economic stimulus money to complete the stalled and over-budget Fulton Street Transit Center in Lower Manhattan, the agency's executive director said on Thursday. 
 The money would bring the project's cost to as much as $1.4 billion, nearly double what was estimated when it was conceived in the wake of the terror attack of Sept. 11, 2001. 
 The additional financing would allow the authority to move ahead with plans to erect an architecturally dramatic glass building atop the transit hub, said Elliot G. Sander, the authority's executive director. However, it was not clear if the final design would include the project's signature feature, a conelike skylight, known as an oculus, that would channel daylight into the lower areas of the station. Mr. Sander said the oculus could add about $40 million to the cost. 
 ''The pavilion has to be many things to many people,'' Mr. Sander said, referring to the glass structure. ''It has to be a building of vibrant design with as much new retail activity as possible.'' He called it ''a highly visible portal to a modern transportation complex.''
 Mr. Sander, who spoke at a State Assembly hearing in Lower Manhattan, said that he estimated the authority would receive $1.5 billion to $2 billion from the economic stimulus bill that is working its way through Congress. He said he planned to spend $497 million of that to complete the downtown transit hub. He did not say how the remainder would be spent. 
 The Fulton Street project, which is a block from the World Trade Center site, was originally financed by the federal government with $750 million that was earmarked for the rebuilding of Lower Manhattan. The project was meant to simplify a tangle of subway stations, topping them off with an eye-catching building that would rival the iconic structures planned for the rebuilt trade center. 
 But costs kept rising, and last January the authority said that while work would continue on the underground portions of the project, it could no longer afford to move ahead with the above-ground structure. The announcement was met with dismay downtown, where residents and businesses feared they would be stuck with an unsightly hole, a site where several buildings had been torn down to make way for the transit work. 
 The hearing on Thursday, which included testimony on other aspects of downtown redevelopment, was called by Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver, whose district includes the transit center site. Mr. Silver has been one of the Fulton Street project's strongest supporters, and authority officials have felt growing pressure to find the financing to complete it.
 Authority officials will also need Mr. Silver's support to push through a proposed financial bailout of the transit system. 
 Mr. Silver said the only connection between the transit center project and the state bailout had to do with restoring the authority's credibility. 
 ''No legislative body in the world institutes a revenue-raising program unless they know how the money's getting spent,'' Mr. Silver said, referring to the possibility of raising taxes to help finance the authority. ''I would suggest that when you begin to take the projects that have been promised and were reneged on by the M.T.A. and you say, 'O.K., here they are, we're fulfilling our commitments,' then you are telling people that you can believe us again.''
 He reiterated his support for the transit system bailout, which is aimed at reducing a proposed 23 percent increase in fare and toll revenues scheduled for this year and at halting deep service cuts.
 ''The M.T.A. board's doomsday plan is not something anybody wants to see in action,'' he said. ''We understand we have to come up with a reasonable plan that would change that result.''
 The exact amount of money that the authority will receive under the stimulus bill will not be known until a final version is passed by Congress and signed by President Obama. Mr. Sander said he did not see a problem with allocating such a large sum to a single project. 
 ''The project needs to be finished,'' he said. ''It does at this point appear to meet the criteria that Congress has put out, and from an economic stimulus standpoint, in terms of job creation, it certainly seems appropriate.''

HEADLINE: Ex-Director of Los Angeles Museum Heads to Dallas

BYLINE: By CAROL VOGEL

 BODY:
Just a month after Jeremy Strick resigned under pressure as director of the beleaguered Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles, he has landed a new job. Starting March 2 he will be director of the Nasher Sculpture Center in Dallas, the institution confirmed.
 The appointment was in the works well before November, when it first came to light that the Museum of Contemporary Art was on the brink of financial collapse. It later negotiated a $30 million lifeline from Eli Broad, the Los Angeles philanthropist, as part of a rescue plan. That arrangement involved a restructuring of its management and Mr. Strick's resignation. During his tenure the museum's endowment fell to about $6 million last year from nearly $50 million in 1999. 
 Mr. Strick said that he first interviewed for the Nasher job last spring, and that talks continued on and off. ''I've known the collection and the institution for a long time,'' he said in a telephone interview. 
 In the fall, as troubles in Los Angeles mounted, Mr. Strick said he put his talks with the Nasher aside. But they resumed again soon after he resigned. ''It's a jewel of an institution with the finest collection of modern and contemporary sculptures in the world,'' Mr. Strick said. 
 The search for a new director began shortly after Steven A. Nash resigned in March 2007 to become director of the Palm Springs Art Museum. David J. Haemisegger, president of the board, said the center had hired a search firm and had assessed what kind of director it needed. ''Jeremy was far and away the best person,'' he said. ''There was immediate chemistry.''
 ''As a young curator at the National Gallery of Art in Washington, he had worked on a show of the Nasher's sculpture and had gotten to know them,'' Mr. Haemisegger added. 
 Asked whether he was concerned about Mr. Strick's track record with finances given the situation in Los Angeles, Mr. Haemisegger said, ''We clearly did our due diligence, and nothing caused us to back away.''
 Founded by Raymond D. Nasher, a Dallas collector and real estate developer who died in 2007, with a collection he formed with his wife, Patsy, who died in 1988, the center opened in October 2003 next to the Dallas Museum of Art. The site includes a building designed by Renzo Piano and a sculpture garden created by the architect Peter Walker. The center's permanent collection includes works by Calder, de Kooning, Giacometti, Picasso, Matisse, Miro and Rodin. 
 The institution has other assets too. By the time Mr. Nasher's estate is settled, Mr. Strick estimates, the center's endowment will total about $100 million. And unlike the endowments at other institutions that have shrunk considerably because of the economy, much of the money from the estate that was earmarked for the sculpture center's endowment remained in cash. 
 In addition the Nasher Foundation, which owns the center and is the beneficiary of the estate, sold about 200 paintings and sculptures in auctions at Sotheby's in May, raising $47.4 million more for the endowment. 
 When he gets to Dallas, Mr. Strick said, one of his goals is to make visitors look at sculpture in a different way. ''I'd like to show a range of practices in and around sculpture -- photographs and drawings, environmental work and social sculptures,'' he said.

HEADLINE: At Reader's Digest, Layoffs Are Part of 'Recession Plan'

BYLINE: By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA

 BODY:
As publishers reel from the recession and a plunge in advertising, the Reader's Digest Association said Thursday that it would lay off close to 300 people, about 8 percent of its work force, as well as put employees on unpaid furloughs and suspend contributions to their 401(k) plans. 
 The company said it was not closing any of its United States magazines or other businesses, but trimming all of its operations in 79 countries. In addition to publishing domestic magazines like the flagship Reader's Digest and Every Day With Rachael Ray, it has dozens of magazines overseas and popular Web sites like Allrecipes.com, and produces dozens of books annually. 
 It recently started a new magazine and membership organization, Purpose Driven Connection, in partnership with the Rev. Rick Warren, the popular author and minister.
 ''We have announced a comprehensive 'recession plan,' which is our internal roadmap for dealing with the extraordinary effects of this recession on consumer spending,'' Mary G. Berner, the president and chief executive, said in a statement. ''We hope and expect that most of these moves will be temporary.''
 Ripplewood Holdings, a private equity firm, bought Reader's Digest Association less than two years ago in a deal that greatly increased its debt burden. The new management has been more aggressive about marketing new products, selling ads and trimming costs.
 The company said it was eliminating the equivalent of 280 full-time jobs, out of 3,500 worldwide. It employs about 1,300 people in the United States.
 It said it would impose unpaid time off ''where permitted by laws and agreements,'' both this year and in 2010, to avoid further layoffs. It did not disclose the duration of the furloughs, or say how many employees would be affected.

LENGTH: 1054 words

HEADLINE: The Man Who Would Be Queen

BYLINE: By CHARLES ISHERWOOD

 BODY:
If you had imagined that the follies of governors were a feature exclusive to the new century, a visit to the Hudson Guild Theater, where the rambling comic romp ''Cornbury: The Queen's Governor'' is installed, will set you straight.
 Well, perhaps straight isn't the word. Three centuries before Eliot Spitzer was brought down by liaisons with a prostitute, a governor of the territory encompassing New York and New Jersey was scandalizing the populace by publicly appearing in drag, according to some accounts from that period. 
 Edward Hyde, Lord Cornbury, a cousin of Queen Anne of England, was sent across the sea in 1702 to rule a colony recently wrested from Dutch control. Lord Cornbury was firmly convinced he looked better in queenly get-ups than his cousin did, and he was not shy about making his case before his constituents. A portrait of a man said to be the governor, his fierce 5 o'clock shadow in piquant contrast to the lavish feminine regalia, can still be seen at the New-York Historical Society. 
 Actually it's not just the figure in the painting that is in dispute. Some historians have argued that the whole cross-dressing thing was just political smear tactics. That's kind of a drag, but fictional or not, Cornbury's adventures in early America are splashed exuberantly if awkwardly across the stage in this play by William M. Hoffman, the author of the landmark AIDS drama ''As Is'' and the libretto for the opera ''The Ghosts of Versailles,'' and the actor Anthony Holland, who died in 1988. The play was conceived as a queer retort (although that adjective had not yet been repurposed) to the pageantry surrounding the country's bicentennial celebrations in 1976, an attempt to add a flamboyant new figure to the gallery of notables in the traditional American history books.
 The camp-as-Christmas style of the show, directed by Tim Cusack for Theater Askew, recalls the heady frolics of Charles Ludlam, the playwright and actor who led the Ridiculous Theatrical Company for two decades before his death in 1987. In the person of Everett Quinton, who plays a righteous Dutch pastor bent on wresting power from the sartorially wayward governor, the production boasts a direct link to that brilliant company. Mr. Quinton was Mr. Ludlam's longtime partner and frequent co-star, and his fire-breathing oratory and angry expectorations in quasi-Dutch provide some of the funniest moments in the show.
 And in David Greenspan, the marvelously odd downtown actor who plays the title role, the play has an interpreter more than equal to the task of imbuing a historical footnote with theatrical allure. Mr. Greenspan is a stalwart foe of dull or ordinary line readings, and he settles happily into the arch period language of the play as if reclining on a bed of silken pillows. In a role that allows him to indulge his penchant for embellishing a phrase with a graceful sweep of the arm or flick of a wrist, he swans grandly off into his own personal heaven.
 But Mr. Greenspan can also turn a lowdown joke deftly. When his treasurer informs him the coffers are empty, Cornbury shrugs. ''Sell Staten Island,'' he suggests. 
 This rococo portrait of a man who would be queen gives the production an entertaining focus. And Mr. Greenspan is surrounded by capable actors cast to type and playing to the hilt: a ripe Bianca Leigh as the villainous Margareta De Peyster, who connives with Mr. Quinton's pastor, Cornelius Van Dam, to have the governor deposed and thrown in prison; a vampy, sexy Ashley Bryant as Cornbury's dresser and fashion consultant, a deposed and enslaved princess named simply Africa; Ken Kliban as the governor's Jewish adviser; Julia Campanelli as Cornbury's kleptomaniacal French wife, Marie; and Christian Pederson as the boyish foe of the fancy-dressing governor who is seduced into rapturous fascination.
 But the colorful performances cannot distract you from the play's potholed surface and the often long pauses between good gags. The scenes seem to be arrayed almost at random, and the story meanders in unnecessary directions. (Why the lesbian love song at the tavern between two characters who then more or less disappear? Why Africa's interminable, not particularly funny recounting of her checkered history?) The play desperately needs an editor.
 The overripe language can be fun, and the text is decorated with some smart, funny lines. ''Mon Dieu,'' Marie sniffs when she and the governor are tossed in the hoosegow, ''if the 18th century begins this way for people of quality, how will it end?'' But there is too much clutter in the way of them. (None of it supplied by the charming trompe l'oeil sets by Mark Beard, however.) 
 The authors also want to make the case that in surrounding himself with an array of men and women of various ethnicities and sexualities, Cornbury was setting an early template for an inclusive America, in liberal contrast to the Puritanical, punishing spirit of the Dutch. Many of the jokes and the characterizations are flamboyantly un-politically correct, but the message is definitely pro-rainbow.
 It's anachronistic, certainly, but then so was Cornbury himself, and not just because he was a drag queen. He also ran up spectacular amounts of debt and plunged the economy of the territory into chaos. Sound familiar?

HEADLINE: Turner and a Few Others Succeed at Slow Sales

BYLINE: By CAROL VOGEL

 BODY:
One of J. M. W. Turner's classically romantic images brought $13 million at Sotheby's on Thursday morning, becoming the most expensive work in two days of turbulent old master painting sales. 
 ''Temple of Jupiter Panellenius Restored'' (1814-16), which had been estimated at $12 million to $16 million, was sold by Richard Feigen, a Manhattan dealer who bought the painting at Christie's in London in 1982 for $1.1 million. 
 Just before the bidding started, Sotheby's announced that it had what it called an irrevocable bid for the painting, meaning a buyer had contractually agreed to purchase it for an undisclosed sum. That safety net turned out to be unnecessary. The painting, depicting figures dancing at dawn, ended up selling for a higher price to a rival bidder on the telephone, whom Sotheby's officials declined to identify. 
 The painting was featured in the traveling Turner retrospective that closed in September at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. 
 ''For great things there's still a lot of money,'' said Mr. Feigen, who sat in the front of Sotheby's salesroom watching the morning's proceedings. 
 But what money there is was being spent judiciously. While the market for old master paintings has not seen the wild gyrations that contemporary art has, and while its buyers tend to be older and more conservative, there was still a noticeable resistance when it came to spending more than $1 million. 
 And unlike the markets for Impressionist, Modern and contemporary art, old masters sales are traditionally dominated by dealers. While many of them could be seen in the salesroom both at Christie's on Wednesday and Sotheby's on Thursday, they were not the biggest buyers. Neither Sotheby's nor Christie's made anywhere near what they had estimated. The reason, several dealers said, is that business has not been good since the financial crisis in the fall. So there is no longer pressure to replenish stock, nor cash to go shopping. 
 ''There was no loose money,'' George Wachter, vice chairman of Sotheby's old master paintings department, said after the morning's session. ''Private people were still bidding, but dealers were particularly selective.'' 
 The morning's sale brought $57.7 million, well below its low estimate of $74.4 million. ''It was hard to know how the market would react,'' Mr. Wachter said when asked if he would have put less expensive works in his sale. ''Eleven paintings still made over $1 million.'' 
 (Final prices include the commission to the auction house: 25 percent of the first $50,000, 20 percent of the next $50,000 to $1 million, and 12 percent of the rest. Estimates do not reflect commissions.) 
 Johnny Van Haeften, a London dealer, was one of the biggest spenders at Sotheby's, although it was unclear whether he was bidding for a client or for his stock. Beating Mr. Feigen and a telephone bidder, he paid $10.2 million for a 1624 work by the Dutch painter Hendrick ter Brugghen, ''Bagpipe Player in Profile.'' It was not only a record price for the artist at auction but also far above its high estimate of $6 million. 
 Yet many works were not sold. Perhaps the biggest casualty was a pair of 1637 portraits by the Dutch artist Frans Hals. In the catalog the two were listed separately: ''Portrait of a Man Holding a Pair of Gloves'' was expected to fetch $8 million to $12 million, and ''Portrait of a Woman Holding a Handkerchief'' was estimated at $7 million to $9 million. 
 But at the last minute the seller, Eric Albada, a Belgian collector, decided to put them on the block together or not at all, and the estimate for the two together was $15 million to $20 million. One person was bidding through Mr. Wachter, but he wouldn't go higher than $11.5 million, and the works were not sold. 
 Christie's sale on Wednesday had far less expensive works. Its morning session brought $11.9 million in sales, well below its low estimate of $19.3 million. Its top seller, Barocci's ''Head of Saint John the Evangelist, an Oil Study for the Entombment of Christ in the Church of Santa Croce, Senigallia,'' was fought over by the London dealer Jean-Luc Baroni and an unidentified telephone bidder. Mr. Baroni, who could be seen taking instructions from a client by cellphone, went home the winner, paying $1.7 million, almost three times the work's high estimate of $600,000. 
 The Christie's sale also featured Turners, but they were watercolors and therefore far less expensive than the Sotheby's offering, and the results were mixed. The best one, ''The Brunig Pass From Meringen, Switzerland,'' executed between 1847 and 1848, sold to a telephone bidder for $1.1 million. It had been estimated at $1.5 million to $2.5 million. 
 Yale School Goes Global 
 This week the Yale University School of Art in New Haven opened an exhibition gallery not as an additional showcase for students' art, but as a space, open to the public, to display contemporary art from around the world. 
 ''It's a way to bring the world here,'' said Robert Storr, the school's dean, ''to provide a variety of information from international artists that one might not get from Yale programs.'' 
 The gallery will present four exhibitions a year, and graduate students will help organize them. ''I'd like people in the graduate program to have the chance to work on the curatorial side so that practicing artists will know more what curators do,'' Mr. Storr said. ''A lot of students don't have a clue how to install their own work.'' 
 The first show, ''Shifting Shapes -- Unstable Signs,'' runs through Feb. 27 and explores work by artists from India. Organized by Mr. Storr and Jaret Vadera, an art student, it focuses on the elusive nature of the signs and symbols of cultural, national and gender identity in contemporary art from regions in India. 
 ''Using video, painting, photography and sculpture by mostly younger artists,'' Mr. Storr said, ''we show how there is not one national cultural identity.''

DATELINE: DAVOS, Switzerland 

 BODY:
 Decoupling is last year's discredited theory.
 It may also be tomorrow's reality. The world's efforts at economic recovery could well turn into a case of every country for itself. Call it ''capital protectionism.''
 A year ago at the World Economic Forum, many chief executives and government officials hoped that an American recession, if one came, would be mild and would not spread overseas. The strength of world economic growth would enable Europe and Asia to ''decouple'' from the American economy. 
 What happened instead was the downside of globalization. Readily available and cheap capital played a crucial role in lifting growth around the world, and its absence for all but the safest borrowers is causing pain everywhere.
 But what is not the same everywhere is the ability of governments to stimulate the economy. While the United States debates the details of how to spend a trillion dollars or more to bail out banks and stimulate the economy, the governments of some other countries find themselves caught in the credit squeeze. 
 In Latvia, the government got a bailout from the International Monetary Fund by agreeing to draconian measures that include wage cuts, spending reductions and tax increases. There were riots.
 The president of Latvia, Valdis Zalters, was diplomatic when I asked him Thursday if he thought it was unfair that the United States could easily borrow when his country could not. ''It's the way it is,'' he said. ''The U.S. has a AAA rating. We had no choice.''
 The best positioned are those countries that have huge foreign currency reserves -- think China -- or printing presses for the international reserve currency -- think the United States.
 ''The money is flowing out of all markets,'' said Ferit F. Sahenk, the chairman of Dogus Group, a Turkish conglomerate. This, he said, raised the risk of inadequate capital ''not only for the banks but for private sector debtors as well.''
 That risk is only increased by what Steven Roach, the Morgan Stanley economist, called ''the rising tide of economic nationalism.'' In both Europe and the United States there is pressure on bailed-out banks to increase lending -- but not to just any borrowers.
 ''Some countries are encouraging their banks to invest mostly in domestic assets,'' Mr. Sahenk complained. ''This is a new form of protectionism.''
 That worry is widespread. ''Large economies are accessing international capital markets for themselves,'' said Trevor Manuel, the finance minister of South Africa.
 He wants the big countries to share the borrowed wealth, but fears they will not.
 Lord Adair Turner, the chairman of Britain's Financial Services Authority, voiced the same concern, calling it ''the risk of a new mercantilism,'' centered on credit availability rather than trade. ''It is not easy to avoid this,'' he added. ''It could get out of hand.''
 The onset of credit protectionism, if it comes, will be the result of a drastic shift in the financial system. Private allocation of credit played a major role in the extraordinary world growth of the last quarter-century, but that system blew up when financial innovation led to a huge overextension of credit to borrowers with dubious ability to repay, whether they were subprime mortgage borrowers or highly leveraged companies.
 With the banks crippled and shown to have taken what now look like foolish risks, it has fallen to governments to allocate credit, either indirectly by deciding which banks to bail out and on what terms, or even directly if, as some expect, many banks are eventually nationalized.
 The pressures for nationalization come in part from worries that bank balance sheets are bottomless pits of toxic assets, and concern that it is unfair to taxpayers to let the benefits flow to the shareholders who stood by as the banks took too many risks.
 Alan S. Blinder, a former vice chairman of the Federal Reserve and now an economics professor at Princeton, said he did not think nationalization would be the first or second choice of American policy makers, but that it could be the third or fourth.
 And he added that the risk of credit protectionism would rise if the banks were nationalized.
 It is hard to imagine that governments will do a particularly good job of allocating capital to its most productive uses, given the political pressures they will face. But there is no agreement on how to get the private banking system operating in an adequate fashion.
 Pumping capital into the banks has not yet worked, even if it has stirred public outrage over high pay and perks for the bankers who got us into this mess. There is renewed interest in some kind of ''bad bank'' approach that would separate the toxic assets from the good ones, leaving the government with the bad stuff. But figuring out what to pay -- assuming the banks have not been nationalized -- is likely to be contentious.
 At the same time, there is much talk about how to reform the regulatory systems around the world, and how to standardize regulation to avoid the ''regulatory arbitrage'' of seeking out jurisdictions with the least stringent rules. 
 ''We allowed a series of near banks and shadow banks to grow without being regulated,'' said Lord Turner. In a new regime, he added, one rule must be, ''If it looks like a bank and quacks like a bank, we have to regulate it like a bank.'' To do that, he would give regulators wide discretion to get information on how hedge funds and other institutions are operating, with the ability to impose regulation if they start to act too much like a bank.
 Some economists fear that would stifle financial creativity, and even some who think far more regulation is needed question whether regulators can amass the expertise to make needed decisions promptly and wisely.
 Mr. Roach predicts that this will be the first year since the Great Depression that the gross domestic product of the entire world declines. Fiscal stimulus plans may help to ease the pain, but it is hard to see how the world's economies can resume decent growth until the private financial system is operating much better than it is now. 
 ''We've all been building this big, integrated financial system,'' said James Rosenfield, a co-founder of Cambridge Energy Research Associates. ''We didn't consider what would happen when it disintegrated.''

HEADLINE: A Short-Term Affair Leads to Big Questions

BYLINE: By A. O. SCOTT

 BODY:
''Everything about being indie is tied to not being black,'' says Micah (Wyatt Cenac), half of the accidental kind-of couple whose one-day romance is chronicled in ''Medicine for Melancholy.'' He is making an observation -- and also registering a complaint -- about the quasi-bohemian way of life he shares with Jo' (Tracey Heggins), his temporary other half. It bothers Micah that their embrace of the folkways of urban hipsterism seems to require the suppression of their African-American identity. 
 But his words, which Jo' doesn't quite agree with, also suggest a degree of self-awareness, and self-questioning, on the part of Barry Jenkins, who wrote and directed this small, incisive film. Most recent movies about culturally savvy, affectless 20-somethings hooking up and being cool are very much tied to not being black. They are about diffident, underemployed white boys and the women who (sometimes inexplicably) go to bed with them. 
 It wouldn't be entirely fair to say that Mr. Jenkins, a 29-year-old director whose immersion in movie history is both ardent and understated, is making a black version of a Joe Swanberg or Andrew Bujalski film, or even, to stretch the comparisons a bit further back, a mash-up of ''Before Sunrise'' and ''She's Gotta Have It.'' But it wouldn't be entirely inaccurate, either, because the tricky questions that govern ''Medicine for Melancholy'' are how, why and to what extent race should matter in relationships between black men and women. 
 At one point Micah asks Jo' if her live-in boyfriend (conveniently overseas on a business trip) is white. ''Does it matter?'' she asks him.
 ''Yes and no,'' he says, and his ambivalence is both the theme of the movie and a crucial element of its curious, ruminative attitudes toward love, race and urban life.
 We first meet Micah and Jo' in a bed that belongs to neither of them, where they have awakened together on the morning after a party. Both act shy and embarrassed, and Jo' seems in a particular hurry to put this brief encounter behind her. Micah, though, proposes breakfast and a shared cab ride home, which Jo' accepts more out of fatigue and some sense of post-coital decorum than out of genuine interest. 
 Micah tries to counter her aloofness with low-key humor, and when Jo' leaves her wallet in the taxi, he tracks her down, bicycling from his apartment in the Tenderloin district of San Francisco to her place in the Marina.
 ''Medicine for Melancholy'' is a two-hander, occupied entirely with the day Jo' and Micah spend together, chatting, flirting, arguing and seeing the sights of San Francisco. But the city's lovingly captured neighborhoods (shot by James Laxton in high-definition digital video from which all but the faintest hints of color have been drained) make the story as much a love triangle as a romance. 
 Micah, a native San Franciscan, is acutely aware of -- Jo' might say obsessed with -- the demographic changes that have accompanied the city's recent boom. He grieves over the attrition of the black population, which he says has shrunk to only 7 percent, and fears that gentrification will destroy his hometown's free, democratic spirit. In a quietly illuminating documentary digression, he and Jo' pause in their wandering to listen to a group of housing-rights activists. 
 Micah's sense of politics and place, as much as the color of his skin, distinguishes him from other mumblecore characters, who traipse through cool, scruffy parts of various cities indifferent to the history that surrounds them and the social contradictions that ensnare them. Mr. Jenkins's spirit is exploratory rather than didactic. Micah is neither a saint nor a mouthpiece, but a young guy with sometimes confused motives and ideas. At first his race-conscious riffs sound, to Jo' and the audience, like pick-up lines, as if he were trying to guilt-trip her back into bed with him. 
 And to some extent they might be. Mr. Cenac, a writer and fake reporter on ''The Daily Show With Jon Stewart,'' calibrates Micah's vacillations between earnestness and guardedness perfectly. Ms. Heggins's character is less developed. We know Jo' is a cinephile, currently unemployed and a transplant to the Bay Area, but she never fully emerges as either a foil or a possible soul mate for Micah.
 But that may be Jo's choice as much as the filmmaker's. There are no simple answers or obvious conclusions to be gleaned from this movie, which, like its soundtrack, is both sad and vibrant, meandering and formally sure-footed. It is an exciting debut, and a film that, without exaggeration or false modesty, finds interest and feeling in the world just as it is.

HEADLINE: Cut on Dotted Line for Knicks' Tickets and Popcorn

BYLINE: By HOWARD BECK

 BODY:
In better times, entry to a Knicks game required a gold credit card and a bank account with at least one comma. Now all fans need is a pair of scissors and a hammer to smash the piggy bank.
 Over the last few months, the Knicks have entered the coupon era. A recent clip-and-save promotion advertised savings of 40 percent on January games at Madison Square Garden. Cutting along the dotted lines also entitled frugal fans to a free box of popcorn.
 They are extreme measures for extreme times, a reflection of the nation's economic recession and the Knicks' own struggles to become respectable again. 
 ''The way we look at it is, we are tirelessly working to make sure we fill this building every single night,'' Scott O'Neil, the president of MSG Sports, said. 
 Under Coach Mike D'Antoni, the Knicks have begun to show real progress. By any objective measure, they are now more competitive and more entertaining than they have been in years. They beat five likely playoff teams this month. They could make the playoffs for the first time in five years. But even so, it is taking a little prodding to get fans back into those teal and purple seats.
 Through 23 games, the Knicks are averaging 19,091 fans, a modest increase over the same period last season. The Garden has been filled to 96.5 percent of capacity. But how much of that attendance depends on cut-rate ticket sales, O'Neil could not, or would not, say.
 Still, the strategy is pretty clear: There are many more less expensive tickets available when the Charlotte Bobcats come to the Garden than when the Los Angeles Lakers do.
 For their Wednesday night game against Atlanta -- a good team, but not a popular one -- the Knicks advertised a $32 ticket in the 200 section, down from $78.50. That represented a 59 percent discount.
 O'Neil called it a ''targeted approach'' during the softer parts of the home schedule. He said the current discounts are no steeper than they have been in recent seasons, although there would seem to more urgency to the situation at the moment. And the Knicks still sell courtside seats for $2,500 to $3,000 a game.
 On a rain-and sleet-filled Wednesday, the Knicks drew 18,180 to their 112-104 victory over the Hawks. The night ended with an ovation, though there was lots of empty teal and purple visible in the crowd.
 But O'Neil sees that changing soon. ''As the team kind of rolls into a playoff push in the spring, our projection is that you're going to see less discounting along the way,'' O'Neil said.
 As recently as six years ago, Knicks tickets were a precious commodity. The team sold out 433 consecutive games from 1993 through 2003, the fifth-longest streak in N.B.A. history.
 They have sold out just 8 of 23 home games this season, but they expect to sell out all three games next week, against the Lakers, Cleveland and Boston, and without the aid of discounted tickets.
 Although the Knicks are taking some extreme measures to fill seats, they are hardly alone. The great majority of N.B.A. teams are offering discounts and extra perks, according to Chris Granger, the league's senior vice president for team marketing and business operations.
 ''It's important,'' Granger said, ''because we care about the fans and we know it's harder on them.''
 The N.B.A.'s biggest discount program has existed for 10 years. Since 1999, every team has been required to offer at least 500 tickets a game for $10 apiece. (On Wednesday, the Indiana Pacers offered thousands of tickets for $5 each after a foot of snow covered the city.)
 Although the recession has affected most teams, it might have a greater impact in New York, where the financial sector has been battered. But the Knicks' malaise predates Wall Street's.
 They have not posted a winning record in eight years. Their roster has been stuffed with mismatched underachievers. They are on their seventh head coach this decade. The last four seasons were dominated by player-coach feuds, bizarre interviews with the news media and a tawdry sexual-harassment trial.
 The effects are evident in the Knicks' season-ticket sales. According to a report in the Sports Business Journal, the Knicks were one of four teams that sold 10,000 season tickets in 2007-8 but failed to hit the mark this season. O'Neil said the club is ''just shy'' of the 10,000 figure.
 The Knicks' era of dysfunction and controversy presumably ended last spring, when Isiah Thomas was fired as coach and president and replaced by D'Antoni and Donnie Walsh. Still, much depends on Walsh's plan to lure a superstar free agent in the summer of 2010. And it is tough to sell fans on dreams of LeBron James in orange and blue when the potential payoff is still 18 months away.
 And yet, said O'Neil, the Knicks have sold 100 new season-ticket packages in the last month, during what is normally a slow sales period.
 ''I think the black cloud has been lifted,'' he said. Somewhere, perhaps, a new sellout streak looms.

ELLESMERE ISLAND EXPEDITION WORKSHOP
 If you think the northeastern United States is freezing these days, remember that cold is a relative term. When Will Steger visited Ellesmere Island in the Canadian Arctic last May, the temperature at the trip's start was a balmy 40 below zero.
 That frigid land, however, showed signs of an alarming warming trend, including an early spring thaw and frequent chunks of broken ice that impeded the progress of Mr. Steger's team. On Saturday he and Tobias Thorleifsson, another member of the expedition, will discuss it with people who might some day have real answers to the Earth's rising temperatures: the children who will be tomorrow's voters and leaders.
 The Ellesmere workshop at Scandinavia House, for ages 7 and older, will document the trek of about 900 miles that Mr. Steger, an American, and his international team made to the remnants of the Ayles Ice Shelf. Deteriorating ice shelves, he said, ''are the canary in the cage, the fingerprint of global warming.'' He and Mr. Thorleifsson, a Norwegian, will give a visual presentation illustrating not just the challenges of climate change, but also those of the expedition, which involved traveling up the island's west coast on skis with three teams of sled dogs, above, carrying supplies. 
 ''The animals are always captivating,'' said Mr. Steger (pronounced STEE-grr), an explorer and author. ''We have pictures of wolves trying to make friends with our dogs, trying to connect noses.'' The team also encountered polar bears, which were just as curious but less amiable. ''We had explosive devices and flares to scare them off,'' he said.
 The men will bring examples of their parkas and mukluks and will describe camping during their 62-day adventure. ''Children usually ask, 'How did you go to the bathroom?' '' Mr. Steger said. The short answer: very quickly.
 Young armchair explorers will receive their own maps so they can follow the journey. Mr. Steger, who operates the Will Steger Foundation, an environmental and educational group, said he hoped to inspire them about the problem of climate change, ''so they can be part of the solution.'' (At 11 a.m., Scandinavia House, 58 Park Avenue, at 38th Street, 212-879-9779, scandinaviahouse.org; free.) 
 'ADVENTURES WITH DORA AND DIEGO' (Friday through Sunday, and Tuesday through Thursday) The young Latino stars of the Nickelodeon animated television series ''Dora the Explorer'' and ''Go, Diego, Go!'' have taken their expeditions into new territory at the Children's Museum of Manhattan, whose exhibition has separate Dora and Diego environments, including Diego's Animal Rescue Center and Dora's Fiesta. Intended for ages 2 to 6, the interactive, bilingual displays are designed to teach language, science and music skills, as well as facts about Latin America. From 10 a.m. to 5 p.m., the Tisch Building, 212 West 83rd Street, (212) 721-1223, cmom.org. Free with museum admission: $10; $7 for 65+; free for under 1 and members.
 'ARCHAEOLOGY ZONE: DISCOVERING TREASURES FROM PLAYGROUNDS TO PALACES' (Sunday through Thursday) Children will step into the shoes of an explorer like Indiana Jones in this exhibition at the Jewish Museum, but the adventures will be purely scholarly. Still, there is plenty of excitement in analyzing artifacts like a jar handle, a clay jug and a bangle and figuring out the purpose behind ancient pieces like a Greek helmet and a bull-shaped vessel. This interactive show also includes a recreated room from the Ottoman period (about 1900), where young archaeologists can dress in costume. (Through June 15.) From 11 a.m. to 5:45 p.m. (until 8 p.m. on Thursdays), the Jewish Museum, 1109 Fifth Avenue, at 92nd Street, (212) 423-3200, thejewishmuseum.org. Free with admission: $12; $10 for 65+; $7.50 for students; free for under 12 and members.

 'BUILDING BRAINSTORM' (Saturday through Thursday) The next generation of budding architects can try out their designs at this new exhibition at the Brooklyn Children's Museum. Opening on Saturday, the bilingual display (English and Spanish) invites children to build model high-rises, houses and crawl-through spaces while devising solutions to architectural and engineering challenges. The fun will include experimenting with color, light and materials. (Through May 10.) At 145 Brooklyn Avenue, at St. Marks Avenue, Crown Heights, (718) 735-4400, brooklynkids.org. Hours: Friday, Wednesday and Thursday, noon to 5 p.m.; Saturday and Sunday, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. Free with admission: $5; free for members and under 1.
 B.Y.O.K. (Sunday) Once people become parents, they often leave their B.Y.O.B. days behind. Now 92YTriBeCa, a new satellite of the 92nd Street Y, is offering the perfect substitute: B.Y.O.K., or Bring Your Own Kid. As the title implies, this series is devoted to cross-generational fun, and so on Sunday it will present Uncle Rock, or Robert Burke Warren, a former stay-at-home dad and former member of rock bands. A current star among the young, he is inspired by sources like Roald Dahl, Pete Seeger and Shel Silverstein. At 11 a.m., 200 Hudson Street, at Canal Street, (212) 601-1000, 92ytribeca.org/BYOK; $15. 
 CHINESE LUNAR NEW YEAR CELEBRATION (Sunday) Wall Street may not be bullish, but Chinese organizations throughout New York will be: it's time to usher in the Year of the Ox. China Institute will welcome the holiday as it always does, with a lion dance at 11 a.m. outside its headquarters on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. It will hold indoor festivities as well: at 12:15 p.m. Mary Man-Kong will read her pop-up book, ''Lucky New Year!,'' an exploration of Chinese customs, and at 1 and 3 p.m. the institute will offer sessions of its popular dumpling-making workshop, in which children learn how to create this tasty symbol of good fortune. 125 East 65th Street, Manhattan, (212) 744-8181, chinainstitute.org. Dance and reading, free. Dumpling workshops: $40 for one adult and one child; $35 for members; $15 each additional person. Registration required at Ext. 138 or via e-mail to pzeng@chinainstitute.org
 'DEAR EDWINA' (Friday through Sunday) What if Ann Landers had been a child -- and she could sing? Then she might have been Edwina Spoonapple, the young heroine of this charming new musical by Zina Goldrich and Marcy Heisler (''Junie B. Jones''). Edwina is an advice columnist who delivers her counsel tunefully, and this show details her quest to be in a festival. (Through April 19.) Friday at 4 p.m.; Saturday at 1, 4 and 7 p.m.; Sunday at 11 a.m. and 1 and 4 p.m. DR2 Theater, 103 East 15th Street, Manhattan, (212) 239-6200, dearedwina.com; $39.
 'DON'T BE LATE: PLAYS ON TIME' (Friday through Sunday) You could say that these productions are early, at least in terms of careers. Six teenagers, ages 13 through 15, working in pairs, have been teamed with adult theatrical professionals: one adult writes a play for the two young people, and another directs it. The creative partnerships are a result of the Two-on-Two series, part of the 52nd Street Project, which provides theater opportunities for disadvantaged youth in the Clinton neighborhood. Another opportunity arrives with these shows: the opening of the Project's new Manhattan theater. Friday and Saturday at 7:30 p.m.; Sunday at 3 p.m.; TBG Theater, 312 West 36th Street, (212) 642-5052, 52project.org. Free, but reservations are required.
 'THE FESTIVAL OF THE VEGETABLES' (Saturday and Sunday) Children don't always welcome vegetables, but they should make an exception for these: they're stars in a theater-dance-music piece about the produce-filled dreams of a toddler who falls asleep in a grocery store. Written by Michael Kosch and choreographed by his wife, Rachael Kosch, the production includes a brussels sprout that chases strollers and a red cabbage that's a Romeo. (Through Feb. 15.) At 11 a.m., Metropolitan Playhouse, 220 East Fourth Street, East Village, (212) 995-5302, metropolitanplayhouse.org.
 'GOLLY GEE WHIZ' (Saturday, Sunday and Wednesday) It's no accident that the main characters in the opening production of Tada! Youth Theater's season are named Judy and Mickey. This musical, a revival from 1999, captures the high spirits of 1930s pop culture, when stars like Judy Garland and Mickey Rooney were all the rage. The action takes place in 1939 in Happyville, where the teenage residents decide to boost the economy by putting on a show. (Maybe it will give audience members a few ideas.) (Through Feb. 15.) Saturday and Sunday at 2 and 4 p.m., Wednesday at 10 a.m. and noon, 15 West 28th Street, Manhattan, second floor, (212) 252-1619, Ext. 128, tadatheater.com; $20; $8 for ages 15 and under; premium tickets (with preferred seating), $25 and $15.
 'HARRY THE DIRTY DOG' (Saturday and Sunday) Manhattan Children's Theater has revived this 45-minute show, which is a delight for ages 3 to 8 and a source of solace to parents. After all, what if all their bath-hating toddlers were dogs? The play, adapted by Karen Abbott from Gene Zion's book of the same title, follows the adventures of the title character, a usually amiable mutt who has a strong antipathy for soap and water. (Through Feb. 22.) At noon and 2 p.m., 52 White Street, near Church Street, TriBeCa, (212) 352-3101, theatermania.com; $20.
 'HOUSE ABOUT IT' (Friday through Sunday, and Tuesday through Thursday) This exhibition gives new meaning to playing house. Created by the Staten Island Children's Museum, the show, whose centerpiece is a child-size house under construction, introduces young visitors to all aspects of the building trades. Activity stations include an architect's office, a space to examine foundation materials and a workbench to practice sawing and drilling. The house offers opportunities for tiling and shingling, and a dollhouse lets young decorators ponder fabrics and furnishings. Hours: Friday, and Tuesday through Thursday, noon to 5 p.m.; Saturday and Sunday, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.; 1000 Richmond Terrace, Livingston, (718) 273-2060, statenislandkids.org. Free with admission: $5; free for members.
 'JASON AND THE ARGONAUTS' (Friday through Sunday) To children it may sound like the title of a futuristic comic book, but those who attend this production, recommended for ages 8 and older, will soon see that this superhero has ancient roots. Presented by Visible Fictions, this show by Robert Forrest at the New Victory Theater recounts the adventures of Jason in his quest for the Golden Fleece in a mere 65 minutes. More amazingly, it does so with only two actors, some action figures and a lot of imagination. Friday at 7 p.m.; Saturday at 2 and 7 p.m.; Sunday at noon; 209 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (646) 223-3010, newvictory.org; $12.50, $25 and $35.
 'JOSE LIMON: THE MAKING OF AN ARTIST' (Saturday through Monday) This latest production from Making Books Sing, an organization that turns literature for young people into musical theater, is as much about dance as about song. Based on an unfinished memoir by Jose Limon and celebrating the 100th anniversary of his birth, the show illustrates his journey from poverty in Mexico to the pinnacle of the modern-dance world. With book and lyrics by Barbara Zinn Krieger and music by Charles Greenberg, the show will also play in Brooklyn. (Through Feb. 13.) Saturday and Sunday at 4:30 p.m.; Monday and Tuesday at 10 a.m. and noon; Symphony Space, 2537 Broadway, at 95th Street, (212) 573-8791, makingbookssing.org; $9 to $23. 
 'LITTLE RED RIDING HOOD'/'LA CAPERUCITA ROJA' (Saturday) The wolf suffers an identity crisis in this puppet musical version by Manuel Antonio Moran, presented in an easy-to- understand mix of Spanish and English by Teatro SEA, which specializes in Latino theater for children. It seems that Little Red can't be persuaded that the wolf is really a wolf, and soon he begins to doubt himself too (with good reason: what wolf talks and sings?). At 3 p.m., Los Kabayitos Puppet Theater, 107 Suffolk Street, near Rivington Street, Lower East Side, (212) 529-1545, sea-online.info; $15; $12.50 for 2 to 12; free for under 2.
 'OPERA EXPLORERS: LIGHTS! CAMERA! OPERA!' (Saturday and Sunday) Yes, opera is now a big-screen event, thanks to the telecasts of major productions the Metropolitan Opera has broadcast in theaters. Now children ages 6 to 12 are invited to sample the experience, as the Met presents interactive screenings of opera excerpts that illustrate elements like characters, story and music. This 60-minute show, hosted by the soprano Jennifer Aylmer, will include scenes from ''The Magic Flute,'' ''Hansel and Gretel, ''The Daughter of the Regiment'' and other works. Saturday at 11 a.m. (sold out) and 1 and 3 p.m.; Sunday at 11 a.m. and 1 p.m.; Dicapo Opera Theater, 184 East 76th Street, Manhattan; (212) 769-7009, metguild.org.; $35; $25 for Metropolitan Opera Guild members.
 'PETER PAN AND ADVENTURES IN NEVERLAND' (Friday through Sunday, and Tuesday through Thursday) New York might seem like a Neverland to many, and it is indeed the setting of Zakiyyah Alexander's new, Americanized adaptation of J. M. Barrie's classic. Presented by the Swedish Cottage Marionette Theater as a puppet musical (Daryl Kojak composed the score), it also features a Tiger Lily who's a native of India. Fridays, and Tuesdays through Thursdays, at 10:30 a.m. and noon (with an additional 2:30 p.m. show on Wednesdays); Saturdays and Sundays at 1 p.m.; 79th Street and the West Drive, Central Park, (212) 988-9093, cityparksfoundation.org; $8; $5 for 18 and under. Reservations required.
 'PINKALICIOUS, THE MUSICAL' (Saturday and Sunday) It's time to think pink again. This show for ages 4 to 12, from Vital Children's Theater, is in yet another revival, so if you missed it earlier, you can catch it now at the Bleecker Street Theater. Elizabeth and Victoria Kann have adapted their children's book, in which the pink-obsessed title character finds out that sometimes being in the pink can be too much of a good thing. (John Gregor wrote the score and some of the lyrics.) (Through April 26.) At 1 p.m., 45 Bleecker Street, at Lafayette Street, East Village, (212) 239-6200, vitaltheatre.org; $29.50.
 PRESERVATION DETECTIVES' FAMILY TOURS (Sunday) The Lower East Side has transformed over the last century, but the past still comes vibrantly alive in many of its corners. One is the Eldridge Street Synagogue, the landmark 1887 building where many Jewish immigrants worshiped. Now the Museum at Eldridge Street, the organization that restored the synagogue, is leading a family tour every Sunday. Children 5 to 10 can view artifacts, learn neighborhood and cultural lore and in February design a three-dimensional community space. At 1 p.m., 12 Eldridge Street, between Canal and Division Streets, (212) 219-0302, eldridgestreet.org; $10; $8 for students and 62+; $6 for ages 5 through 18.
 SPECIAL CAMP FAIR (Saturday) Children and teenagers with disabilities can also enjoy camp. This annual event, presented by Resources for Children With Special Needs, offers information on 70 day and sleepaway options in the Northeast, as well as travel and remedial education programs. From 11 a.m. to 3 p.m., Church of St. Paul the Apostle, 405 West 59th Street (entrance is on Columbus Avenue, near 60th Street), Clinton., (212) 677-4650, resourcesnyc.org; free.
 SUNDAYS UNDER THE WHALE (Sunday) It's nowhere near as uncomfortable as it sounds. This whale happens to be the artificial one suspended over the Milstein Hall of Ocean Life of the American Museum of Natural History, where the museum is presenting the first program in this series. Recommended for ages 6 and older, the series will open with ''New Fossil Discoveries,'' which will include the biologist Neil Shubin, the paleontologist Mark Norell and the animation producer Andy Davies-Coward in an exploration of how scientists use DNA and fossils to explain the evolution of animal anatomy. From 1 to 3 p.m., Central Park West and 79th Street, (212) 769-5100, amnh.org. Free with suggested museum admission: $15; $11 for students and 60+; $8.50 for children.
 TENNIS LESSONS(Saturdays and Sundays) Aspiring Venus Williamses and Andy Roddicks can get into the swing of things long before summer at this free program, sponsored by the New York Junior Tennis League. Open to children ages 6 through 18, the sessions, held in all five boroughs through March, include not only tennis instruction but also special events and a concluding tournament. Tennis equipment is available for loan; parents must register their children onsite. More information and a full list of locations:(347) 417-8157, nyjtl.org.
 THUNDERBIRD AMERICAN INDIAN DANCERS' DANCE CONCERT AND POW-WOW (Friday through Sunday) Don't expect to finish these performances sitting down and clapping politely. At the end of every show the Thunderbird American Indian Dancers invite spectators to join them in the Round Dance, a celebration of friendship. The performers, who offer dances, stories and music from a variety of Indian cultures, also meet with children after each matinee, which is 90 minutes long (evening shows are two hours) and especially geared to family audiences. (Through Feb. 8.) Friday at 8 p.m.; Saturday at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sunday at 2 p.m.; Theater for the New City, 155 First Avenue, at Ninth Street, East Village, (212) 254-1109, theaterforthenewcity.net; $10; $1 for children at matinees only (when accompanied by a ticket-buying adult).
 'A YEAR WITH FROG AND TOAD' (Saturday and Sunday) Along with Oscar and Felix -- or, for young audiences, Bert and Ernie -- Frog and Toad are among the arts world's great Odd Couples. This musical, by the brothers Robert Reale (music) and Willie Reale (book and lyrics), brings to life their friendship, first imagined by Arnold Lobel in his 1970s series of children's books. A scaled-down version of the show that ran on Broadway in 2004, ''Frog and Toad'' has found a perfect home in Atlantic for Kids, the children's wing of the Atlantic Theater Company. The results are reminiscent of the title characters' picnics: light but still satisfying, and as nourishing as they are unpretentious. (Through March 1.) At 10:30 a.m., Linda Gross Theater, 336 West 20th Street, Chelsea, (646) 216-1190, atlantictheater.org; $15; $10 for under 12 and members. 
 , Wednesday, Thursday) The next generation of budding architects can try out their designs at this new exhibition at the Brooklyn Children's Museum. Opening on Saturday, the bilingual display (English and Spanish) invites children to build model high-rises, houses and crawl-through spaces while devising solutions to architectural and engineering challenges. The fun will include experimenting with color, light and materials. (Through May 10.) At 145 Brooklyn Avenue, at St. Marks Avenue, Crown Heights, (718) 735-4400, brooklynkids.org. Hours: Friday, Wednesday and Thursday, noon to 5 p.m.; Saturday and Sunday, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. Free with admission: $5; free for members and under 1.
 B.Y.O.K. (Sunday) Once people become parents, they often leave their B.Y.O.B. days behind. Now 92YTriBeCa, a new satellite of the 92nd Street Y, is offering the perfect substitute: B.Y.O.K., or Bring Your Own Kid. As the title implies, this series is devoted to cross-generational fun, and so on Sunday it will present Uncle Rock, or Robert Burke Warren, a former stay-at-home dad and former member of rock bands. A current star among the young, he is inspired by sources like Roald Dahl, Pete Seeger and Shel Silverstein. At 11 a.m., 200 Hudson Street, at Canal Street, (212) 601-1000, 92ytribeca.org/BYOK; $15. 
 CHINESE LUNAR NEW YEAR CELEBRATION (Sunday) Wall Street may not be bullish, but Chinese organizations throughout New York will be: it's time to usher in the Year of the Ox. China Institute will welcome the holiday as it always does, with a lion dance at 11 a.m. outside its headquarters on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. It will hold indoor festivities as well: at 12:15 p.m. Mary Man-Kong will read her pop-up book, ''Lucky New Year!,'' an exploration of Chinese customs, and at 1 and 3 p.m. the institute will offer sessions of its popular dumpling-making workshop, in which children learn how to create this tasty symbol of good fortune. 125 East 65th Street, Manhattan, (212) 744-8181, chinainstitute.org. Dance and reading, free. Dumpling workshops: $40 for one adult and one child; $35 for members; $15 each additional person. Registration required at Ext. 138 or via e-mail to pzeng@chinainstitute.org
 'DEAR EDWINA' (Friday through Sunday) What if Ann Landers had been a child -- and she could sing? Then she might have been Edwina Spoonapple, the young heroine of this charming new musical by Zina Goldrich and Marcy Heisler (''Junie B. Jones''). Edwina is an advice columnist who delivers her counsel tunefully, and this show details her quest to be in a festival. (Through April 19.) Friday at 4 p.m.; Saturday at 1, 4 and 7 p.m.; Sunday at 11 a.m. and 1 and 4 p.m. DR2 Theater, 103 East 15th Street, Manhattan, (212) 239-6200, dearedwina.com; $39.
 'DON'T BE LATE: PLAYS ON TIME' (Friday through Sunday) You could say that these productions are early, at least in terms of careers. Six teenagers, ages 13 through 15, working in pairs, have been teamed with adult theatrical professionals: one adult writes a play for the two young people, and another directs it. The creative partnerships are a result of the Two-on-Two series, part of the 52nd Street Project, which provides theater opportunities for disadvantaged youth in the Clinton neighborhood. Another opportunity arrives with these shows: the opening of the Project's new Manhattan theater. Friday and Saturday at 7:30 p.m.; Sunday at 3 p.m.; TBG Theater, 312 West 36th Street, (212) 642-5052, 52project.org. Free, but reservations are required.
 'THE FESTIVAL OF THE VEGETABLES' (Saturday and Sunday) Children don't always welcome vegetables, but they should make an exception for these: they're stars in a theater-dance-music piece about the produce-filled dreams of a toddler who falls asleep in a grocery store. Written by Michael Kosch and choreographed by his wife, Rachael Kosch, the production includes a brussels sprout that chases strollers and a red cabbage that's a Romeo. (Through Feb. 15.) At 11 a.m., Metropolitan Playhouse, 220 East Fourth Street, East Village, (212) 995-5302, metropolitanplayhouse.org.
 'GOLLY GEE WHIZ' (Saturday, Sunday and Wednesday) It's no accident that the main characters in the opening production of Tada! Youth Theater's season are named Judy and Mickey. This musical, a revival from 1999, captures the high spirits of 1930s pop culture, when stars like Judy Garland and Mickey Rooney were all the rage. The action takes place in 1939 in Happyville, where the teenage residents decide to boost the economy by putting on a show. (Maybe it will give audience members a few ideas.) (Through Feb. 15.) Saturday and Sunday at 2 and 4 p.m., Wednesday at 10 a.m. and noon, 15 West 28th Street, Manhattan, second floor, (212) 252-1619, Ext. 128, tadatheater.com; $20; $8 for ages 15 and under; premium tickets (with preferred seating), $25 and $15.
 'HARRY THE DIRTY DOG' (Saturday and Sunday) Manhattan Children's Theater has revived this 45-minute show, which is a delight for ages 3 to 8 and a source of solace to parents. After all, what if all their bath-hating toddlers were dogs? The play, adapted by Karen Abbott from Gene Zion's book of the same title, follows the adventures of the title character, a usually amiable mutt who has a strong antipathy for soap and water. (Through Feb. 22.) At noon and 2 p.m., 52 White Street, near Church Street, TriBeCa, (212) 352-3101, theatermania.com; $20.
 'HOUSE ABOUT IT' (Friday through Sunday, and Tuesday through Thursday) This exhibition gives new meaning to playing house. Created by the Staten Island Children's Museum, the show, whose centerpiece is a child-size house under construction, introduces young visitors to all aspects of the building trades. Activity stations include an architect's office, a space to examine foundation materials and a workbench to practice sawing and drilling. The house offers opportunities for tiling and shingling, and a dollhouse lets young decorators ponder fabrics and furnishings. Hours: Friday, and Tuesday through Thursday, noon to 5 p.m.; Saturday and Sunday, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.; 1000 Richmond Terrace, Livingston, (718) 273-2060, statenislandkids.org. Free with admission: $5; free for members.
 'JASON AND THE ARGONAUTS' (Friday through Sunday) To children it may sound like the title of a futuristic comic book, but those who attend this production, recommended for ages 8 and older, will soon see that this superhero has ancient roots. Presented by Visible Fictions, this show by Robert Forrest at the New Victory Theater recounts the adventures of Jason in his quest for the Golden Fleece in a mere 65 minutes. More amazingly, it does so with only two actors, some action figures and a lot of imagination. Friday at 7 p.m.; Saturday at 2 and 7 p.m.; Sunday at noon; 209 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (646) 223-3010, newvictory.org; $12.50, $25 and $35.
 'JOSE LIMON: THE MAKING OF AN ARTIST' (Saturday through Monday) This latest production from Making Books Sing, an organization that turns literature for young people into musical theater, is as much about dance as about song. Based on an unfinished memoir by Jose Limon and celebrating the 100th anniversary of his birth, the show illustrates his journey from poverty in Mexico to the pinnacle of the modern-dance world. With book and lyrics by Barbara Zinn Krieger and music by Charles Greenberg, the show will also play in Brooklyn. (Through Feb. 13.) Saturday and Sunday at 4:30 p.m.; Monday and Tuesday at 10 a.m. and noon; Symphony Space, 2537 Broadway, at 95th Street, (212) 573-8791, makingbookssing.org; $9 to $23. 
 'LITTLE RED RIDING HOOD'/'LA CAPERUCITA ROJA' (Saturday) The wolf suffers an identity crisis in this puppet musical version by Manuel Antonio Moran, presented in an easy-to- understand mix of Spanish and English by Teatro SEA, which specializes in Latino theater for children. It seems that Little Red can't be persuaded that the wolf is really a wolf, and soon he begins to doubt himself too (with good reason: what wolf talks and sings?). At 3 p.m., Los Kabayitos Puppet Theater, 107 Suffolk Street, near Rivington Street, Lower East Side, (212) 529-1545, sea-online.info; $15; $12.50 for 2 to 12; free for under 2.
 'OPERA EXPLORERS: LIGHTS! CAMERA! OPERA!' (Saturday and Sunday) Yes, opera is now a big-screen event, thanks to the telecasts of major productions the Metropolitan Opera has broadcast in theaters. Now children ages 6 to 12 are invited to sample the experience, as the Met presents interactive screenings of opera excerpts that illustrate elements like characters, story and music. This 60-minute show, hosted by the soprano Jennifer Aylmer, will include scenes from ''The Magic Flute,'' ''Hansel and Gretel, ''The Daughter of the Regiment'' and other works.

 'PETER PAN AND ADVENTURES IN NEVERLAND' (Friday through Sunday, and Tuesday through Thursday) New York might seem like a Neverland to many, and it is indeed the setting of Zakiyyah Alexander's new, Americanized adaptation of J. M. Barrie's classic. Presented by the Swedish Cottage Marionette Theater as a puppet musical (Daryl Kojak composed the score), it also features a Tiger Lily who's a native of India. Fridays, and Tuesdays through Thursdays, at 10:30 a.m. and noon (with an additional 2:30 p.m. show on Wednesdays); Saturdays and Sundays at 1 p.m.; 79th Street and the West Drive, Central Park, (212) 988-9093, cityparksfoundation.org; $8; $5 for 18 and under. Reservations required.
 'PINKALICIOUS, THE MUSICAL' (Saturday and Sunday) It's time to think pink again. This show for ages 4 to 12, from Vital Children's Theater, is in yet another revival, so if you missed it earlier, you can catch it now at the Bleecker Street Theater. Elizabeth and Victoria Kann have adapted their children's book, in which the pink-obsessed title character finds out that sometimes being in the pink can be too much of a good thing. (John Gregor wrote the score and some of the lyrics.) (Through April 26.) At 1 p.m., 45 Bleecker Street, at Lafayette Street, East Village, (212) 239-6200, vitaltheatre.org; $29.50.
 PRESERVATION DETECTIVES' FAMILY TOURS (Sunday) The Lower East Side has transformed over the last century, but the past still comes vibrantly alive in many of its corners. One is the Eldridge Street Synagogue, the landmark 1887 building where many Jewish immigrants worshiped. Now the Museum at Eldridge Street, the organization that restored the synagogue, is leading a family tour every Sunday. Children 5 to 10 can view artifacts, learn neighborhood and cultural lore and in February design a three-dimensional community space. At 1 p.m., 12 Eldridge Street, between Canal and Division Streets, (212) 219-0302, eldridgestreet.org; $10; $8 for students and 62+; $6 for ages 5 through 18.

 SUNDAYS UNDER THE WHALE (Sunday) It's nowhere near as uncomfortable as it sounds. This whale happens to be the artificial one suspended over the Milstein Hall of Ocean Life of the American Museum of Natural History, where the museum is presenting the first program in this series. Recommended for ages 6 and older, the series will open with ''New Fossil Discoveries,'' which will include the biologist Neil Shubin, the paleontologist Mark Norell and the animation producer Andy Davies-Coward in an exploration of how scientists use DNA and fossils to explain the evolution of animal anatomy.

 'A YEAR WITH FROG AND TOAD' (Saturday and Sunday) Along with Oscar and Felix -- or, for young audiences, Bert and Ernie -- Frog and Toad are among the arts world's great Odd Couples. This musical, by the brothers Robert Reale (music) and Willie Reale (book and lyrics), brings to life their friendship, first imagined by Arnold Lobel in his 1970s series of children's books. A scaled-down version of the show that ran on Broadway in 2004, ''Frog and Toad'' has found a perfect home in Atlantic for Kids, the children's wing of the Atlantic Theater Company. The results are reminiscent of the title characters' picnics: light but still satisfying, and as nourishing as they are unpretentious. (Through March 1.)

HEADLINE: Senators Bid To Regulate Hedge Funds

BYLINE: By STEPHEN LABATON

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Two senior senators introduced legislation on Thursday to impose government oversight of hedge funds.
 The legislation by Senator Carl Levin, Democrat of Michigan, and Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa, was filed as the Obama administration was preparing a broader legislative overhaul of the regulatory system, including an effort to more tightly regulate hedge funds. 
 State regulators and a panel created by Congress to oversee the $700 billion Troubled Asset Relief Program issued separate but similar regulatory proposals on Thursday. The proposals also seemed to closely mirror many of the provisions that administration officials say will be part of their plan.
 The regulatory overhaul is one piece of the administration's effort to restore confidence in the financial system. 
 Other pieces include a stimulus bill that the House passed on Wednesday and that is moving through the Senate, and an overhaul of the financial assistance program for the nation's largest banks.
 Senior administration officials have been in discussions this week with Wall Street executives over proposals for managing the remaining $350 billion in the troubled assets program. A new plan is expected to be announced soon.
 At the same time, the administration is preparing to propose tighter regulation of credit rating agencies, new federal oversight of mortgage brokers and greater supervision of credit-default swaps, the unregulated financial instruments that experts say contributed to the economic crisis.
 Lawmakers have also signaled that they intend to take up legislation to more tightly regulate the markets. Meeting with reporters on Thursday afternoon, Senator Christopher J. Dodd, the Connecticut Democrat who heads the Senate banking committee, outlined an ambitious schedule for hearings next month on regulatory issues. 
 They will feature testimony from Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner, Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke and Paul A. Volcker, a former Fed chairman who is an adviser to President Obama. 
 Mr. Dodd acknowledged that the administration was hoping to complete many of its proposals before a meeting of the Group of 20 nations in London on April 2.
 Administration officials have expressed a particular interest in tightening regulation over hedge funds, a move that was opposed by the Bush administration even though William H. Donaldson, chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission under President Bush, tried to force the funds to register as investment advisers. 
 His effort was successfully challenged in 2006 when the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia ruled that the commission's regulation had exceeded its authority. 
 The Levin-Grassley legislation would correct that problem by giving the commission the unambiguous authority to regulate hedge fund advisers.
 ''If the events of the last year have taught us anything, it's that we need to regulate firms that are big enough to destabilize our economy if they fail,'' Mr. Levin said. ''It's time to subject financial heavyweights like hedge funds to federal regulation and oversight to protect our investors, markets and financial system.''
 Mr. Grassley said he believed the political winds had shifted since he made a similar proposal two years ago. It was never considered by Congress.
 ''The wizards on Wall Street figured out a million clever ways to avoid the transparency sought by the securities regulations adopted during the 1930s,'' Mr. Grassley said. ''Instead of the free flow of reliable information that markets need to function properly, today we have confusion and uncertainty fueling an economic crisis.''

HEADLINE: Israeli Elections and Gaza Violence Complicate New U.S. Envoy's Peace Mission

BYLINE: By ISABEL KERSHNER

DATELINE: JERUSALEM 

 BODY:
President Obama's special Middle East envoy told Palestinian leaders in the West Bank on Thursday that he had a mandate to actively pursue the Israeli-Palestinian peace process, according to a Palestinian official, despite a pall of uncertainty over the future of negotiations pending the outcome of Israeli elections on Feb. 10.
 The envoy, George J. Mitchell, on his first trip to the region in his new role, traveled to Ramallah, the West Bank headquarters of the Western-backed Palestinian Authority, and met with President Mahmoud Abbas of Fatah and other Palestinian leaders. Only the Palestinian Authority officially speaks for Palestinians in the talks with Israel. 
 ''Lasting peace is our objective,'' Mr. Mitchell told reporters after the meeting. ''The United States will sustain an active commitment to two states living side by side in peace, stability and security.'' 
 Saeb Erekat, a senior Abbas aide who attended the meeting, said by telephone that Mr. Mitchell mainly ''listened for 90 minutes'' to the Palestinian president. Mr. Erekat said that Mr. Abbas touched on the situation in Gaza, where Fatah's rival, the Islamic militant group Hamas, holds sway; on attempts for reconciliation between Fatah and Hamas, whose 18-month-old split has further complicated prospects for a Palestinian state; and on the issue of reconstruction after Israel's punishing offensive against Hamas in Gaza. 
 Mr. Abbas briefed the American envoy on the details of his negotiations with Israel over the past year and reiterated his commitment to the two-state vision, while underscoring the ''devastating effect'' of Israel's continued settlement activity in the West Bank, Mr. Erekat said. 
 The negotiations, aimed at establishing an independent Palestinian state alongside Israel, began at an American-sponsored peace conference in Annapolis, Md., in late 2007. No agreement was reached by the target date of the end of 2008.
 In a meeting with Prime Minister Ehud Olmert of Israel on Wednesday, Mr. Mitchell heard what Israel had offered the Palestinians in the talks. According to the newspaper Yediot Aharonot, the offer included the evacuation of 60,000 Israelis from outlying Jewish settlements in the West Bank and land exchanges to compensate the Palestinians for the settlement blocs that Israel intends to keep. Arab neighborhoods of East Jerusalem were to be given over to the Palestinian control, and the holy sites were to come under international supervision. 
 But opinion polls indicate that Benjamin Netanyahu, the leader of Likud, the right-wing opposition party, is likely to prevail in the Israeli elections and form the next governing coalition, creating doubts about the continuation of the process in its current format. 
 Mr. Erekat, a senior Palestinian negotiator, noted that Mr. Netanyahu had never expressed support for the two-state solution and possibly ''never will.''
 Mr. Mitchell's brief remarks also focused on the importance of shoring up the fragile Gaza truce. ''To be successful in preventing the illicit traffic of arms into Gaza,'' he said, ''there must be a mechanism to allow the flow of legal goods'' through the Gaza border crossings with the participation of the Palestinian Authority. 
 Earlier on Thursday, Mr. Mitchell met with the Israeli army chief of staff, Lt. Gen. Gabi Ashkenazi, to discuss security issues.
 Israel and Hamas began separate cease-fires on Jan. 18, and Egypt is trying to broker a more sustainable truce. But Israeli officials have said they are in no hurry to reach agreements with Hamas. They are adamant that Hamas should not benefit in any way in the aftermath of the military offensive, which Israel says was intended to stop Hamas from firing rockets into Israel.
 The tenuous calm was broken again early Thursday when a rocket was fired from Gaza into Israel, the second in 12 hours. It landed in an open area and caused no injuries. 
 Hours later, Israel carried out an airstrike in the southern Gaza town of Khan Yunis against a member of a squad the military said was responsible for a bombing on Tuesday that killed an Israeli soldier patrolling the Israeli side of the border.
 Israel said the target was a former Hamas operative who split from the group to join an organization called Global Jihad.
 News reports from Gaza described the militant, who was wounded, as a Hamas policeman on a motorcycle and said several civilians, including schoolchildren, were wounded in the strike. 
 Mr. Netanyahu, the Israeli opposition leader, said that he would encourage rapid economic development for the Palestinians in the West Bank but that he would take a harsh line on Hamas. He suggested Thursday that the Gaza campaign had not achieved its goals. ''It is clear Hamas is rearming,'' he told Israel Radio. ''Of course it is attacking us.''
 ''The next government will have no choice but to finish the work,'' he said.
 U.N. Chief Urges Gaza Aid
 In Davos, Switzerland, the United Nations secretary general, Ban Ki-moon, on Thursday made an appeal for $613 million in emergency aid for Palestinians in Gaza, saying, ''Help is needed urgently.'' 
 Mr. Ban visited Gaza after both sides declared unilateral cease-fires almost two weeks ago. He is the highest-ranking international figure to have visited Gaza since the war. He was speaking to reporters covering the World Economic Forum in Davos. 
 The new United States ambassador to the United Nations, Susan E. Rice, also spoke about Gaza on Thursday as she made her first official appearance at the Security Council. In a closed session about the protection of civilians, she noted ''the loss of Palestinian and Israeli life in recent weeks and the tragic suffering of Palestinian civilians, who require urgent humanitarian and reconstruction assistance.''

HEADLINE: Profit Rises At Amazon As Shoppers Seek Deals

BYLINE: By BRAD STONE

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO 

 BODY:
In December, Amazon.com said it was having its ''best ever'' holiday season. On Thursday, it offered proof. 
 The company posted strong earnings in a brutal climate that has punished nearly every other retailer, online and offline. Amazon's net profit rose 9 percent, to $225 million, or 52 cents a share, in the quarter that ended on Dec. 31, up from $207 million, or 48 cents, in the same quarter a year earlier.
 ''We remain relentlessly focused on serving customers with low prices, great selection and free shipping offers, including Amazon Prime,'' Jeff Bezos, founder and chief executive of Amazon, said in a statement. 
 The company's revenue climbed 18 percent to $6.70 billion, surpassing Wall Street's expectations. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters on average expected $6.44 billion in revenue.
 After hours, Amazon shares were trading around $56, an increase of more than 13 percent. In the regular trading session, before Amazon's announcement, shares closed largely unchanged at $50. 
 Amazon's robust growth rate far exceeded the overall growth rate of other online retailers during the holidays, which was slightly down, the Web measurement company comScore said.
 ''We're particularly grateful for the unusually strong demand for Kindle in the fourth quarter,'' Mr. Bezos said, referring to the company's electronic book reader. It was out of stock for most of the holiday season, but the company encouraged consumers to order it for later delivery.
 Amazon released no new statistics on sales of the Kindle, which has been a hit. The company has scheduled a news conference in New York on Feb. 9 to introduce a new version of the device.
 Some analysts say Amazon may have benefited from the economic slowdown as people turned to the e-commerce site to find bargains.
 ''Amazon may be enjoying a Wal-Mart effect, with people trading down to Amazon to get better prices over the holiday,'' said Mark Mahaney, an analyst at Citigroup. ''Amazon must have dramatically taken market share'' from other retailers during the quarter, he said. 
 But in a sign that Amazon was not immune to the recession, its operating margins fell to 4.06 percent from 4.78 percent, a result of heavy discounting to persuade reluctant shoppers to buy. 
 Amazon offered a broad estimate for the current quarter and did not make any estimate for the year, as it normally had. It said it expected operating income of as much as $210 million, a 19 percent increase over the first quarter of 2008. At its most pessimistic, the forecast was for a 9 percent increase. 
 One immediate challenge for Amazon is the liquidation of Circuit City. The electronics chain is emptying 154 stores, which could drive down the prices of items like flat-screen televisions. 
 In the long term though, the carnage in the traditional retail sector is ''incredibly positive'' for Amazon, said Scott W. Devitt, an analyst at Stifel Nicolaus. ''Amazon has never been in a stronger structural position, and you have a shrinking industry with a high fixed-cost base that is forcing bankruptcies,'' he said. ''That business has to go somewhere.''
 In another sign of how Amazon.com has diversified its business beyond its original product lines of books, music and movies, the sales of electronics and general merchandise in the fourth quarter grew to $2.89 billion, a 31 percent increase over a year earlier. The sale of media items grew just 9 percent in the same period.
 Among Amazon's newest product offerings and services are motorcycle and all-terrain-vehicle parts, a new Web service called CloudFront for businesses to deliver large content files to their customers, and Amazon Video on Demand, a digital television and movie store that is accessible online or through living room devices like TiVo.

HEADLINE: Hearing 'Stimulus,' Fearing Debt

BYLINE: By NELSON D. SCHWARTZ

DATELINE: DAVOS, Switzerland 

 BODY:
Even as Congress looks for ways to expand President Obama's $819 billion stimulus package, the rest of the world is wondering how Washington will pay for it all. 
 Few people attending the World Economic Forum question the need to kick-start America's economy, the world's largest, with a package that could reach $1 trillion over two years. But the long-term fallout from increased borrowing by the United Stated government, and its potential to drive up inflation and interest rates around the world, seems to getting more attention here than in Washington.
 ''The U.S. needs to show some proof they have a plan to get out of the fiscal problem,'' said Ernesto Zedillo, the former Mexican president who helped steer his country through a financial crisis in 1994. ''We, as developing countries, need to know we won't be crowded out of the capital markets, which is already happening.'' 
 Mr. Zedillo said that Washington, unlike most other countries, had the option of simply printing more money, because the dollar was a reserve currency for the rest of the world.
 Over the long run, that could force long-term interest rates higher and drive down the value of the dollar, undermining the benefits that come with its special status.
 Until now, most fears about surging government debt have focused on borrowing by European countries like Spain, Greece and especially Britain, which is also in the midst of a sizable bank bailout. That recently forced the British pound to a 23-year low against the dollar.
 While the dollar's status as refuge in a time of turmoil should prevent that kind of sell-off for now, a number of financial specialists warned that if fundamental factors like the lack of American savings and bloated budget deficits did not change, the dollar could eventually fall sharply .
 ''There aren't that many safe havens,'' said Alan S. Blinder, a Princeton economist who is a former vice chairman of the Federal Reserve in Washington, explaining why the dollar's status as a reserve currency is unlikely to be threatened.
 Instead, it is the dollar's long-term value against other currencies that is vulnerable. ''At some point, there may be so much Treasury debt, that investors may start wondering if they are overloaded in dollar assets,'' Mr. Blinder said.
 While the focus in Washington has been on putting together a stimulus package that will attract broader political support when it comes up for a vote in the Senate, here in Davos the talk has been about the coming avalanche of Treasury debt needed to pay for the plan on top of the bailout measures approved last fall, like the $700 billion Troubled Asset Relief Program, or TARP.
 The stimulus was approved Wednesday by the House without Republican support, and could grow larger -- mostly likely with additional tax cuts -- to attract a bipartisan coalition.
 American officials maintain they are aware of the challenge. A top White House adviser, Valerie Jarrett, promised in Davos on Thursday that once the stimulus plan achieved its intended affect, the United States would ''restore fiscal responsibility and return to a sustainable economic path.'' 
 To be sure, Congress and the White House will ultimately need to refill the government's coffers, but how they might do that is barely on the radar screen in Washington at this point.
 ''Even before Obama walked through the White House door, there were plans for $1 trillion of new debt,'' said Niall Ferguson, a Harvard historian who has studied borrowing and its impact on national power. He now estimates that some $2.2 trillion in new government debt will be issued this year, assuming the stimulus plan is approved.
 ''You either crowd out other borrowers or you print money,'' Mr. Ferguson added. ''There is no way you can have $2.2 trillion in borrowing without influencing interest rates or inflation in the long-term.''
 Mr. Ferguson was particularly struck by the new borrowing because the roots of the current crisis lay in an excess of American debt at all levels, from homeowners to Wall Street banks.
 ''This is a crisis of excessive debt, which reached 355 percent of American gross domestic product,'' he said. ''It cannot be solved with more debt.''
 While Mr. Ferguson is a skeptic of the Keynesian thinking behind President Obama's plan -- rather than borrowing and spending to stimulate the economy, he favors corporate tax cuts -- even supporters of the plan like Mr. Zedillo and Stephen Roach of Morgan Stanley have called on the White House to quickly address how it will pay for the spending in the long-term.
 ''It's huge,'' Mr. Roach, the chairman of Morgan Stanley Asia, said. ''President Obama has now laid out a scenario of multiyear, trillion-dollar deficits.''
 The stimulus is widely expected to pass, but once it does, Mr. Roach said the focus would shift to ''who foots the bill and what is the exit strategy. We don't have the answer to either question.''
 Mr. Zedillo, who remembers how Mexico was forced to tighten its belt when it received billions from Washington to keep its economy from collapsing in 1994, was even more blunt. 
 ''People are not stupid,'' Mr. Zedillo said. ''They see the huge deficit, the huge spending, and wonder what comes next.''

HEADLINE: Politics and the Stimulus Package

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re ''House Approves $819 Billion Plan for Economic Aid'' (front page, Jan. 29):
 In watching the political dance that Republicans have been doing since Jan. 21, I note the obvious -- that the G.O.P. is terrified not only that President Obama and the Democratic Party may save the ''economic'' day, but also that history will then incorporate the fact, leaving Republicans out in the cold for years to come. 
 What else explains why not one single Republican in the House cared enough about the hardships facing Americans to vote ''yes'' on a swift attempt to help them? 
 As they did under George W. Bush, Republicans appear still to be acting in lock step, instead of following their conscience. If they are trying to regain some respect in the court of public opinion, that is a very dangerous act indeed. 
 Surely Congress can later pass follow-up amendments to the president's plan. At this juncture in the economic crisis, the stimulus plan doesn't have to be perfect; it just has to get going.
 Patricia A. Weller Emmitsburg, Md., Jan. 29, 2009
 To the Editor:
 President Obama has clearly invited the Republican leadership to join with him as he leads the nation in a new direction. The Republicans' lack of support as the House passed his spending and tax cut proposals is disappointing, but it's their game to lose if they underestimate his vision and his sharp elbows under the basket.
 Alan Goldfarb Fremont, Calif., Jan. 29, 2009
 To the Editor:
 If as President Obama says, he won, and has the necessary votes to get the legislation that he wants, what is the burning desire to have Republicans accept a plan that is contrary to their beliefs?
 Mr. Obama gets his plans, and a definite distinction is drawn between what Democrats and Republicans stand for. And if his plan succeeds, then he and his party get all the credit, but conversely, should his tax-and-spend plan fail, he and his party will get all the blame.
 Seems perfectly fine. And in two years, the people can judge the results of what each party has brought to the table and vote accordingly.
 Barry Levy Hawthorne, Calif., Jan. 29, 2009
 To the Editor:
 Re ''The Stimulus Advances'' (editorial, Jan. 29):
 There was not one single Republican vote for the stimulus package as conceived by President Obama. The Republicans voted on an ideological basis, with no thought for those who need help the most. This is not new for them.
 One might have thought that they learned something from the election, but they haven't. They might also want Mr. Obama to fail, which means America fails, with them included in the sinking ship. 
 They were presented with a stimulus package that did the most for those who needed it the most, but it is not the poor and middle class they want to help. At least they are consistent in their misunderstanding of the present situation and of the American people.
 Stanley R. Bermann Santa Fe, N.M., Jan. 29, 2009
 To the Editor:
 The stimulus bill passed by the House has generated increasingly heated, but thoughtful, conflict among economists, and a rather less thoughtful ''just say no'' reaction from Republicans.
 Given the need for speed -- which all concerned seem to agree will magnify the ''bang for the buck'' -- and the growing consensus around certain elements, I believe that Congress should act promptly to pass the approximately half of the House package that covers jobless benefits, food stamps, aid to states and the tax cuts to low- and middle-income citizens.
 The transformative elements are no less vital, and should be taken up by Congress immediately thereafter. Because that spending will take more time to be effective, there could be additional -- if limited -- time for further debate. 
 By that time, the Treasury should be ready with a comprehensive plan for the banks' continuing ''toxic asset'' problem, which should be carried out as nearly concurrently with the full stimulus as possible, for maximum effect on the confidence of everyone. 
 Pete Runnette New Canaan, Conn., Jan. 29, 2009
 To the Editor:
 After reading Maureen Dowd's Jan. 28 column, ''Wall Street's Socialist Jet-Setters,'' I realized what has been bothering me all along about the recovery package: without some kind of sacrifice by every citizen and business, I feel far less inspired to roll up my own sleeves.
 The vultures who ran our confidence over the cliff in the first place seem to bear little or no burden and seem to be working from an entirely different alphabet when it comes to rolling up their sleeves with the rest of Americans. They make no apparent sacrifice. 
 It doesn't take a mathematician to see that this equation doesn't work and might stir resentment, but it does explain my own fundamental uneasiness about the possible success of the recovery package.

HEADLINE: As Bailouts Mount, Monetary Fund Weighs Issuing Its Own Bonds

BYLINE: By NELSON D. SCHWARTZ

DATELINE: DAVOS, Switzerland 

 BODY:
In a sign that more national bailouts may be needed to prevent what has become a global financial crisis from worsening, the International Monetary Fund is expected to borrow $100 billion from Japan and may even issue bonds, an unprecedented step in its 64-year existence. 
 Dominique Strauss-Kahn, the fund's managing director, has already said it needs to double its available resources, and that the fund was exploring options for further lending to cash-poor nations totaling about half a billion dollars in the next six to eight months.
 The Japanese pledge for financing was first broached at the Group of 20 summit meeting in Washington in November, and the fund's executive board will formally take up the need for additional money at its scheduled board meeting in Washington on Tuesday, said Bill Murray, a fund spokesman.
 Mr. Murray declined to comment on further options.
 Although the fund has always had the ability to turn to the capital markets and issue bonds for money, it has never done so. The fund is considering that step now because of the possibility of additional bailouts, as one country after another turns to it for help.
 The fund has emerged as a main source of financing for emerging-market nations, as the credit crisis spread from the United States to Eastern Europe and beyond. In November, the fund approved more money in loans to governments than in any other month in its history, committing nearly $50 billion.
 In addition to Iceland, which required help after the collapse of its banking sector and a plunge in the value of its currency, the fund has also come to the aid of Ukraine, Latvia, Hungary and other Eastern European countries.
 In another closely watched move, Pakistan, one of a wave of countries whose economies had been growing robustly in recent years, received $7.6 billion in help from the fund in late November. The fund currently has about $250 billion in funds available immediately, but is now considering doubling that figure. 
 Bonds are an option, the fund official emphasized, but supplemental government support is another possibility.

Bank of America
 Needs a Nudge
 What's the difference between Citigroup, the Royal Bank of Scotland and Bank of America? Sadly, this is not the opening line of a Scottish-American joke -- there's nothing funny about the tens of billions in losses these three financial institutions have racked up among them, forcing them to go hat in hand to the state for aid. 
 Citi and RBS, based in Edinburgh, have at least held insiders accountable. Bank of America, by contrast, has done nothing of the sort. 
 Sure, problems struck Bank of America, based in Charlotte, N.C., more recently than those of its two rivals. But the effect on shareholders has been no less catastrophic. After Ken Lewis, the Bank of America boss, struck a deal in September to buy Merrill Lynch for a 70 percent premium, the deal quickly soured. The bank's shares have plummeted 85 percent in a year. 
 Chuck Prince, the former Citi boss, was ditched for less, and Fred Goodwin left his post as chief of RBS as soon as the British government bailed out his bank. 
 Both Citi and RBS are also starting to shake up their boards. Robert Rubin, Citi's consigliere for the last decade, and the chairman, Win Bischoff, have already stepped down. Meanwhile, RBS is gearing up to diversify a board that outsiders have long considered too parochially Scottish.
 So far the only major casualty at Bank of America from the Merrill fiasco has been John Thain. But that's hardly a sacrifice for the bank -- he ran Merrill. And Mr. Thain inherited Merrill's problems and arguably did right by his shareholders in selling out to Bank of America before the post-Lehman Brothers tsunami put Merrill out of business. Moreover, by paying out bonuses before consummating the messy deal, he's a hero to his former employees. 
 Though the same cannot be said of Mr. Lewis, he retains his three roles as chairman, chief executive and president. And he even got a vote of confidence from his lead independent director, Temple Sloan. Mr. Sloan, an auto-parts magnate from Raleigh, N.C., expressed his support for Mr. Lewis and his team for ''their experience in managing through challenging environments and in assimilating mergers.'' 
 That show of confidence seems hardly deserved given Bank of America's recent track record and suggests the bank's board is woefully unappreciative of its own role in allowing Mr. Lewis to run amok. Shareholders counting up their losses from Bank of America's destructive empire-building should remind them of the fates that many Citi and RBS directors have suffered for their own failures in accountability. 
 A History Lesson
 ''This is the worst recession since the Second World War.'' So say too many pundits. One British newspaper rammed home the point by splashing its front page with a grainy picture of bombed-out London. It's fine to be gloomy, but such comparisons are deeply misleading. 
 In most rich countries this year, gross domestic product may decline by 2 percent or more. If things go very badly, total output could end up 10 percent lower by the time the recession hits bottom. But even that would leave G.D.P. per person in many industrialized nations around the level of 2000, when most were still growing, despite the popping of the Internet bubble.
 Relatively speaking, the economy did fall off a cliff after Lehman's bankruptcy crushed trade credit and financial confidence. But in absolute terms, today's economy still contains consumer comforts, health care and a relatively sturdy safety net that make it better off than even the postwar boom period of the 1950s. 
 A man whose net worth drops to $10 million from $100 million may have to sell the polo ponies and two of the three vacation houses. He could well feel devastated, since the decline in social status is tough to take, or his appreciation of polo is deep and meaningful. Still, the remaining millions will limit sympathy for the polo-shaped hole in his life. 
 It shouldn't be so different for the plight of rich countries in this recession. The decline in consumption will be inconsequential. The rise in unemployment will be hard on those affected, but jobs will be found and benefits will ease the pain. Safety nets have come a long way since the war. 
 Thankfully, there are no signs of anything like the widespread homelessness, hunger, misery and fear of the Great Depression in the United States and the postwar years in much of Europe. These may not be the best of times, but let's not pretend they are anything close to the worst. ANTONY CURRIE and EDWARD HADAS

 Ratings and running times are in parentheses; foreign films have English subtitles. Full reviews of all current releases, movie trailers, showtimes and tickets: nytimes.com/movies.
 'BEDTIME STORIES' (PG, 1:38) ''I don't believe in happy endings,'' says Skeeter (Adam Sandler), a resentful hotel handyman, to his young niece and nephew. Luckily his director, Adam Shankman, loves them, dragging Skeeter and the rest of the cast through a variety of threadbare fantasies -- an Old West showdown, a medieval joust -- that fail to juice a movie soured by uninspired writing and an enervated star. And if there were an Oscar for miscasting, Guy Pearce's atrocious turn as the hotel's pompous manager would be a lock. (Jeannette Catsoulis) 'BRIDE WARS' (PG, 1:34) Die, Bridezilla, die! (Manohla Dargis) 'CALIFORNIA DREAMIN' ' (No rating, 2:35, in Romanian, English, Spanish and Italian) When the Romanian director Cristian Nemescu died in 2006 at 27, he left behind a handful of brilliant shorts and this feature, which won a prize in Cannes the next year. 
Longer than it might have been had he lived to trim it, the movie is an incisive satire of cultural collision. In 1999 a company of American soldiers (led by Armand Assante) is stranded in a Romanian backwater on its way to Kosovo, and the men's sojourn is marked by sex, violence, chaos, absurdity and a queasy sense of the pleasures and catastrophes of an American-dominated global order. (A. O. Scott) 
 'CHANDNI CHOWK TO CHINA' (PG-13, 2:20, in Hindi, Cantonese and Mandarin) The immensely popular Akshay Kumar stars in this genial mash-up of Bollywood and kung fu. Too frantic at the beginning, ''Chandni'' settles down to become an enjoyable if slight Saturday matinee picture. It was financed and distributed by Warner Brothers, a first for Bollywood. 
 (Rachel Saltz) 
 'THE CLASS' (No rating, 2:08, in French, with English subtitles) An artful, intelligent, heartfelt fiction film from the director Laurent Cantet about modern French identity and the attempt to transform young students of all sizes, shapes and colors into citizens through talk, talk, talk. (Dargis)
 'CRIPS AND BLOODS: MADE IN AMERICA' (No rating, 1:45) The director Stacy Peralta tracks the history of violent Los Angeles gangs with heart in his well-intended documentary, but not enough intellectual skepticism. (Dargis)'THE CURIOUS CASE OF BENJAMIN BUTTON' (PG-13, 2:47) A hothouse blossom of romance, intrigue and breathtaking digital effects from David Fincher (''Zodiac,'' ''Fight Club''). Brad Pitt stars as a man who ages backward, but it is Cate Blanchett who provides the film's delicate, graceful emotional center of gravity. (Scott) 
 'DOUBT' (PG-13, 1:44) Adapted by John Patrick Shanley from his stage play, this drama about a Roman Catholic priest suspected of child molestation stars a tamped-down Philip Seymour Hoffman as the accused and an energetic, often wackily comic Meryl Streep as his accuser. (Dargis) 
 'FROST/NIXON' (R, 2:02) It's twinkle (Michael Sheen) versus glower (Frank Langella) in Ron Howard's amusing, facile edition of the Peter Morgan theatrical smackdown. 
 (Dargis)
 'FROZEN RIVER' (R, 1:37) Venturing deep into the trenches where hard-working Americans struggle to put food on the table, Courtney Hunt's powerful, somber film evokes a perfect storm of present-day economic and social woes. Playing an impoverished mother of two who smuggles illegal aliens across the Canadian border, Melissa Leo gives an awards-worthy performance. 
 (Stephen Holden)
 'GRAN TORINO' (R, 1:56) Once again Clint Eastwood shows everyone how it's done, with a sleek muscle car of a movie set in that industrial graveyard called Detroit about a racist who befriends a besieged Hmong family next door. (Dargis)'HOTEL FOR DOGS' (PG, 1:40) Children and dogs: those two magic words distill the appeal of this cuter-than-cute, sweeter-than-sweet family film about animal-loving kids who embark on a crusade to rescue all the stray pooches in a fictional city. 
 (Holden)
 'INKHEART' (PG, 1:43) A movie about books coming to life that never manages to do so itself. (Scott) 
 'LAST CHANCE HARVEY' (PG, 1:38) Dustin Hoffman and Emma Thompson don't make a lot of sense as a screen couple, but there's something irresistible about watching two people fall in love, even in contrived, sniffle- and sometimes gag-inducing films like this one. (Dargis)
 'MILK' (R, 2:08) Gus Van Sant's film about Harvey Milk (1930-78), the San Francisco City supervisor who was one of the first openly gay elected officials in the country, is less a standard biopic than a sharp, lyrical history lesson, touching not only on a crucial decade in the gay-rights movement but also on the rough and tumble of big-city politics and the tricky ways of love. Sean Penn outdoes himself as Milk, balancing his intense conviction with an unusual and welcome playfulness. (Scott)
 'MOSCOW, BELGIUM' (No rating, 1:42, in Flemish) You may have observed the characters' banal situations in countless other movies, not to mention in your own life, but it is unusual to find them explored with such matter-of-fact truthfulness. (Holden)
 'MY BLOODY VALENTINE 3D' (R, 1:41) Adding an extra dimension to the fondly remembered 1981 Canadian slasher about a rogue slayer in a small mining town, ''My Bloody Valentine 3D'' blends cutting-edge technology and old-school prosthetics to produce gore you can believe in. And if the gas-masked villain is less than terrifying, his pursuit of a naked young woman (Betsy Rue) is inspired. If there were an award for acting full-frontally while wearing sky-high stilettos, Ms. Rue would surely teeter away with it. 
 (Catsoulis) 
 'NOT EASILY BROKEN' (PG-13, 1:39) Directed by Bill Duke and based on a novel by the megachurch minister T. D. Jakes, this story of a marriage under stress is hokey and sometimes clumsy, but anchored in an earnest engagement with the lives of its characters, who have the good fortune of being portrayed by a fine cast. (Scott)
 'NOTORIOUS' (R, 2:02) The legend of Biggie Smalls, the Brooklyn-born rapper who was murdered in 1997, is given the full epic-melodrama-biopic treatment in this uneven, rarely dull film, among whose producers are Smalls's mother, Violetta Wallace, and his friend and mentor Sean Combs. Those two important figures are played by Angela Bassett and Derek Luke, while Smalls is impersonated by Jamal Woolard, whose faithful mimicry compensates for some of his limitations as an actor. (Scott)
 'OF TIME AND THE CITY' (No rating, 1:14) Terrence Davies's first documentary is a lyrical, barbed reminiscence of postwar Liverpool, in which the nostalgic charm of archival footage flickers in tense counterpoint with Mr. Davies's rueful, barbed narration. (Scott) 
 'PAUL BLART: MALL COP' (PG, 1:30) Fat people are funny. Fat people who run into things are funnier. Fat people who run into things and have humiliating working-class jobs? Stop, you're killing me! (Nathan Lee)
 'RACHEL GETTING MARRIED' (R, 1:54) Anne Hathaway plays Kym, furloughed from rehab to attend her sister Rachel's wedding. The director, Jonathan Demme, working from a script by Jenny Lumet, takes a fairly conventional family-therapy drama and packs it with exuberant vitality. There is ample sorrow and recrimination at this party, but nonetheless you'll be sorry when it ends. (Scott)
 'THE READER' (R, 2:03) You have to wonder who, exactly, wants or perhaps needs to see another movie about the Holocaust that embalms its horrors with artfully spilled tears and also asks us to pity a death camp guard. Kate Winslet plays the guard; Stephen Daldry directs. (Dargis)
 'REVOLUTIONARY ROAD' (R, 1:59) Sam Mendes directs Kate Winslet and a fine Leonardo DiCaprio in a waxworks edition of the corrosive, furiously unsentimental novel by Richard Yates about an unhappy marriage in the mid-1950s. (Dargis)
 'SLUMDOG MILLIONAIRE' (R, 2:00) A modern fairy tale from Danny Boyle (''Trainspotting'') about a pauper angling to become a prince, this sensory blowout largely takes place amid the squalor of Mumbai, India, where lost children and dogs sift through trash so fetid that you swear you can smell the discarded mango as well as its peel. (Dargis)
 'TROUBLE THE WATER' (No rating, 1:33) While making this superb documentary about that natural and unnatural disaster, Hurricane Katrina, the filmmakers Carl Deal and Tia Lessin hit the jackpot when they meet two New Orleans survivors, Kimberly and Scott Roberts, who rode out the storm with a video camera. (Dargis)'UNDERWORLD: RISE OF THE LYCANS' (R, 1:32) Michael Sheen howls up a storm in this prehistory to the first two ''Underworld'' flicks, which rewinds to when the werewolves rebelled against their vampire masters. (Dargis) 
 'VALKYRIE' (PG-13, 2:00) Bryan Singer (''X-Men'') directs this slick, facile action flick about the heroic Claus von Stauffenberg, a Third Reich officer who made several attempts to assassinate Hitler. Tom Cruise plays the hero with his usual vigor and an eye patch. (Dargis)
 'WENDY AND LUCY' (R, 1:20) In Kelly Reichardt's latest film Michelle Williams plays Wendy, a lonely young woman who encounters a run of bad luck while drifting through Oregon and Washington with her dog, Lucy. At first glance the film seems like little more than an extended anecdote, but underneath this plain narrative surface is a lucid and melancholy inquiry into the current state of American society. (Scott) 
 'THE WRESTLER' (R, 1:45) Mickey Rourke, with sly, hulking grace, stars as a washed-up wrestler hoping for a comeback. But like its hero, the movie has a blunt, exuberant honesty, pulling off even its false moves with conviction and flair. (Scott)

HEADLINE: After Record Loss, Ford Will Tap Lines of Credit to Bolster Cash

BYLINE: By BILL VLASIC

DATELINE: DETROIT 

 BODY:
After closing the books on a $14.6 billion loss in 2008 -- the worst annual result in its 105-year history -- Ford Motor Company said Thursday that it would draw the last $10.1 billion from its lines of credit to add to its cash hoard so that it could survive the increasingly bleak vehicle market.
 Ford's chief executive, Alan R. Mulally, said the company, which tapped credit markets to build its cash reserves well before the economy soured, remained determined to finance its operations without the federal aid that was extended to its crosstown rivals, General Motors and Chrysler. 
 ''I think there's more awareness than ever that Ford is on a very different path,'' Mr. Mulally said in an interview. 
 He added that it had become a marketing advantage for Ford with consumers shopping for an American car. ''Our dealers have told us that people know that Ford is in a better place,'' Mr. Mulally said.
 Ford joined G.M. and Chrysler in December in asking Washington for a combined $34 billion in loans, but has since backed away from seeking its portion of the request. G.M. and Chrysler, however, needed $17.4 billion in emergency loans from the Treasury Department to avoid filing for bankruptcy.
 Both G.M. and Chrysler must deliver plans to government officials by Feb. 17 to show they are pursuing the drastic restructuring actions that were required of them as a condition of receiving the federal loans.
 Ford's miserable sales in 2008 worsened sharply in the fourth quarter, with nearly $6 billion of the total $14.6 billion loss coming in the fourth quarter. It was a year in which Ford's revenue declined almost 20 percent, and its cash reserves declined by $21 billion.
 The automaker ended 2008 with $13.4 billion in available cash, which it will augment by tapping into its credit lines for another $10.1 billion.
 Ford's financial health owes considerably to its decision in late 2006 to mortgage its assets and arrange long-term borrowing before the credit markets dried up.
 Now, with more than $23 billion in hand, Ford can keep spending billions of dollars on new products during what promises to be another tough year for vehicle sales around the world.
 Ford said Thursday that it expects the United States market to total 11.5 million to 12.5 million vehicles in 2009. Last year, industry sales fell 18 percent, to 13.2 million vehicles.
 The company is also forecasting lower sales in the already depressed regions of Europe and South America, and little if any growth in Asia.
 Still, Mr. Mulally reiterated his pledge that Ford would break even or become profitable by 2011.
 To achieve that, Ford will continue its cost-cutting efforts, which have reduced its global employment by more than 40,000 workers in the last three years.
 The company said it would reduce its structural costs by $4 billion in the coming year, primarily through cutting salaried personnel and streamlining its global manufacturing and engineering operations.
 By 2010, Ford expects that 40 percent of its vehicles sold in North America will have platforms shared with its European operations. ''And we expect there will be complete alignment by 2013,'' Mr. Mulally said.
 More of Ford's future products will be smaller, more fuel-efficient cars. The company will introduce several important products this year, including a redesigned Taurus sedan and a new hybrid gas-electric version of the Fusion midsize car.
 Yet, by most accounts, Ford will be introducing its newest models in a market that appears to be getting worse by the month.
 Auto sales plummeted 35 percent in the fourth quarter of last year, and analysts are predicting another sizable drop for January.
 Industry sales in January could fall to as low as 730,000 vehicles -- an 18 percent decrease from December and a 30 percent decline from the same month last year, according to the auto-buying Web site Edmunds.com.
 Ford and other automakers have cut their production substantially in recent months to match the drop in demand.
 Scaling back production until the economy recovers is critical to Ford's overall goals of conserving cash and avoiding the need to seek government assistance.
 ''Nothing is more important than matching our production to the real demand,'' Mr. Mulally said.
 Although Ford is not facing a government directive to cut its labor costs and reorganize its long-term debt load, the company is working toward that end in the same manner as G.M. and Chrysler.
 Mr. Mulally said Ford expected to match any concessions that G.M. and Chrysler were able to negotiate from the United Automobile Workers union and their lenders.
 ''We are having ongoing conversations with all our stakeholders,'' he said. ''We will not be disadvantaged.''

HEADLINE: Obama Signs Equal-Pay Legislation

BYLINE: By SHERYL GAY STOLBERG

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
President Obama signed his first bill into law on Thursday, approving equal-pay legislation that he said would ''send a clear message that making our economy work means making sure it works for everybody.''
 Mr. Obama was surrounded by a group of beaming lawmakers, most but not all of them Democrats, in the East Room of the White House as he affixed his signature to the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, a law named for an Alabama woman who at the end of a 19-year career as a supervisor in a tire factory complained that she had been paid less than men. 
 After a Supreme Court ruling against her, Congress approved the legislation that expands workers' rights to sue in this kind of case, relaxing the statute of limitations. 
 ''It is fitting that with the very first bill I sign -- the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act -- we are upholding one of this nation's first principles: that we are all created equal and each deserve a chance to pursue our own version of happiness,'' the president said. 
 He said was signing the bill not only in honor of Ms. Ledbetter -- who stood behind him, shaking her head and clasping her hands in seeming disbelief -- but in honor of his own grandmother, ''who worked in a bank all her life, and even after she hit that glass ceiling, kept getting up again'' and for his daughters, ''because I want them to grow up in a nation that values their contributions, where there are no limits to their dreams.''
 The ceremony, and a reception afterward in the State Dining Room of the White House, had a celebratory feel. The East Room was packed with advocates for civil rights and workers rights; the legislators, who included House and Senate leaders and two moderate Republicans -- Senators Susan Collins and Olympia Snowe, both of Maine -- shook Mr. Obama's hand effusively (some, including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, received presidential pecks on the cheek) as he took the stage. They looked over his shoulder, practically glowing, as Mr. Obama signed his name to the bill, using one pen for each letter.
 ''I've been practicing signing my name very slowly,'' Mr. Obama said wryly, looking at a bank of pens before him. He handed the first pen to the bill's chief sponsor, Senator Barbara Mikulski, Democrat of Maryland, and the last to Ms. Ledbetter. 
 The ceremony also marked First Lady Michelle Obama's policy debut; she spoke afterward in a reception in the State Dining Room, where she called Ms. Ledbetter ''one of my favorite people.''
 Mr. Obama told Ms. Ledbetter's story over and over again during his campaign for the White House; she spoke frequently as an advocate for him during his campaign, and made an appearance at the Democratic National Convention in Denver. 
 Now 70, Ms. Ledbetter discovered when she was nearing retirement that her male colleagues were earning much more than she was. A jury found her employer, the Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company plant in Gadsden, Ala., guilty of pay discrimination. But in a 5-4 decision, the Supreme Court threw out the case, ruling that she should have filed her suit within 180 days of the date that Goodyear first paid her less than her peers.
 Congress tried to pass a law that would have effectively overturned the decision while President George W. Bush was still in office, but the White House opposed the bill; opponents contended it would encourage lawsuits and argued that employees could delay filing their claims in the hope of reaping bigger rewards. But the new Congress passed the bill, which restarts the six-month clock every time the worker receives a paycheck .
 Ms. Ledbetter will not see any money as a result of the legislation Mr. Obama signed into law. But what she has gotten, aside from celebrity, is personal satisfaction, as she said in the State Dining Room after the signing ceremony.
 ''Goodyear will never have to pay me what it cheated me out of,'' she said. ''In fact, I will never see a cent. But with the president's signature today I have an even richer reward.''

HEADLINE: Bloomberg Will Seek $900 Million More in Sales Taxes

BYLINE: By DAVID W. CHEN; Michael Barbaro contributed reporting.

 BODY:
A month after imposing a property tax increase, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg is expected to call for a $900 million increase in the city's sales tax on Friday, as the city confronts a loss of revenue due to the economic downturn. 
 New York City already has one of the highest sales taxes in the nation, at 8.375 percent, and retailers are likely to fight the increase. 
 City officials declined to offer specifics. But according to a budget plan discussed late last year by administration officials, the city could generate almost $900 million by increasing the sales tax to 8.75 percent. Under that plan, the city would also do away with the current exemption on some clothing purchases. 
 Mr. Bloomberg's proposal, which will be unveiled in his annual budget address on Friday, requires approval from the City Council and the State Legislature, which is now considering whether to raise a range of taxes to close its own $15 billion gap.
 Mr. Bloomberg's budget address will be the last one before November, when he will ask voters to return him to office for a third term. As such, every decision will be viewed through a political prism, and raising taxes is hardly the standard recipe for election victory.
 Still, Mr. Bloomberg has never been shy about such moves, whether it is raising property taxes or banning smoking in restaurants and bars. And the notion of raising the sales tax does not come as a complete surprise, since Mr. Bloomberg took the unusual step in November of offering a midyear budget update, spelling out potential measures to generate revenue, the sales tax increase among them.
 At first blush, some city officials briefed on the plan did not reject Mr. Bloomberg's suggestion out of hand. City Councilman David I. Weprin, chairman of the finance committee, took some solace in the fact that the mayor did not plan to propose an increase in the personal income tax -- as he had suggested in November -- or another increase in property taxes.
 ''It's certainly not a good-news budget, but it's seems to be a responsible approach to closing the budget gap, and it's a reality that we on the Council have to deal with,'' he said.
 Mr. Weprin warned that much could change between now and the July 1 start of the fiscal year and that the budget deal must be agreed on by the mayor, the Council and the Legislature.
 Indeed, city officials said that it was unclear, as of Thursday night, just how Mr. Bloomberg planned to generate the extra revenue in sales taxes: Would he repeal the sales tax clothing exemption? And would he increase the sales tax permanently? Or would he do what has been done before, and increase a portion of it temporarily?
 The menu of budget options Mr. Bloomberg and his aides released in November called for a sales tax increase to 8.75 percent, generating almost $900 million. If that approach is approved, this is how the increase would affect New Yorkers, according to a consumer spending analysis by the city's Independent Budget Office: An individual who makes $35,000 a year would pay an extra $55. Someone making $125,000 would pay $140 more a year. And someone making $500,000 a year would pay an additional $247.
 In addition to the sales tax increase, Mr. Bloomberg would eliminate the $400 property tax rebate, for an approximate savings of $250 million. He also planned to renew his call for Albany to approve legislation that would charge customers a nickel for each new plastic bag they use at most stores. 
 So far that measure has not gained great traction with the public, despite supporters' claims that it is both environmentally friendly and good for the city's bottom line. There may be other taxes or fees as well.
 The tax increases are part of a broader package of tough-love measures that Mr. Bloomberg intends to outline on Friday. 
 He plans to slice another $1 billion in spending and will also unveil various proposals to overhaul the city's pension system, reduce capital spending and require city employees to contribute toward their health care. 
 That might be a tough sell with labor unions, but the mayor plans to warn that if unions do not cooperate, the work force could shrink by as much as 23,000 through attrition and layoffs. 
 One of the criticisms of Mr. Bloomberg's stewardship of city finances has been his lack of progress in taking on the more difficult structural issues that keep city spending high, like pension costs. He has also been generous in extending pay raises to city employees.
 The budget also relies on an expected $1 billion in federal Medicaid assistance, which was included as part of Washington's stimulus package.
 Officials said on Thursday that the proposed budget would probably be smaller than this year's because revenues have decreased.
 The taxes and cuts underscore the approach Mr. Bloomberg has taken to deal with something he was all too familiar with shortly after taking office in 2002, but was not during the boom years of Wall Street: enormous budget deficits.
 This year, Mr. Bloomberg cut spending by $1.5 billion, and the increase in property taxes approved last month was expected to generate $600 million.
 In December, Mr. Bloomberg and the Council also approved an increase in the hotel tax, to 5.875 percent from 5 percent per room, or about $3 a night.
 Edward Skyler, the city's deputy mayor for operations, said on Thursday that the mayor will be looking for help in solving the budget deficit from unions and legislators from Albany to Washington.
 ''We all will have to do our part to get through these tough times,'' Mr. Skyler said.

HEADLINE: A Senator Takes Office, Departure Already in Sight

BYLINE: By RITA K. FARRELL

DATELINE: WILMINGTON, Del. 

 BODY:
In the twilight of his career, Edward E. Kaufman has returned to Washington.
 In 1976, Mr. Kaufman began 19 years as chief of staff to Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr. of Delaware. He left to become a campaign consultant and a member of the federal Broadcasting Board of Governors, and to continue teaching Duke University law students about Congress. 
 Now, at age 69, he is back as a newly minted Democratic senator, formally appointed on Jan. 15 by the departing governor, Ruth Ann Minner, to fill the seat vacated by Vice President Biden. 
 Ms. Minner's decision, announced less than three weeks after the Nov. 4 election, occurred in an atmosphere serene compared with that surrounding the Senate appointments of Roland W. Burris in Illinois and Kirsten E. Gillibrand in New York.
 Still, her choice of Mr. Kaufman, whom everybody calls Ted, took the state by surprise, including the appointee himself, who has never run for office. His hometown newspaper misspelled his name, the public asked ''Ted who?'' and Mr. Kaufman had just rented a Florida condominium where he and his wife, Lynne, were planning to spend the winter. 
 Ms. Minner said in an interview that she felt Mr. Kaufman was well prepared for the job.
 ''He had followed the war, followed what Joe had done and could go to work without any learning curve at all,'' she said, adding that she had spoken to two or three other prospective appointees. She took herself out of the running, she said, because at age 74 and after a long career, ''I didn't want to commute, and I didn't want to work.''
 For all of that, Democrats were particularly stunned that Ms. Minner bypassed John C. Carney Jr., her lieutenant governor in each of her two four-year terms, and there was widespread speculation that Mr. Kaufman's appointment had largely to do with Mr. Biden's ambitions for his oldest son, State Attorney General Joseph R. Biden III, who, the father has said, ''would make a great United States senator.'' 
 Mr. Kaufman has made clear that he will not run next year in an election to fill the last four years of what would have been the seventh term for Senator Biden, who ran simultaneously in 2008 for both re-election and the vice presidency. Mr. Kaufman's appointment, and his absence from next year's field, mean the younger Mr. Biden, now fulfilling a commitment with his National Guard unit in Iraq, will not need to face an incumbent if he seeks the seat.
 That has prompted headlines like ''Placeholder Senator: Ted Kaufman, D-Biden'' (The Nation) and ''Was Biden's replacement pick made to help his son get elected?'' (Politico). 
 Mr. Kaufman resents being called a placeholder.
 ''I don't get it,'' he said in an interview. ''It's the opposite. I'm going to fill the seat for two years, and anybody that wants to run in 2010 can run. So how am I a placeholder? The people of Delaware should pick the person they want, and they will do that in 2010 because Governor Minner selected me and I'm not going to run then.''
 The younger Mr. Biden himself, known as Beau, has said he intends to run for re-election as attorney general next year. But not everyone is convinced. ''I give you my word,'' Mr. Kaufman said, ''I don't have any idea what he'll do.''
 The tenure of Beau Biden's father was the 14th-longest in Senate history; Mr. Kaufman's will be one of the shortest. But barely two weeks into his job, the new lawmaker can scarcely contain his enthusiasm. His staff is in place, and 80 percent of its members are Biden veterans he has known for years. He is on the Foreign Relations and Judiciary Committees, his first choices and those he knows best. 
 He has echoed the Obama-Biden call for immediate action on the economic stimulus package and for financing ''shovel-ready'' projects to repair roads, bridges and schools. 
 ''Everyone I've talked to, from liberal to conservative, says this is what we've got to do,'' he said. ''Put money in people's hands.''
 His decisions, he said, will reflect Mr. Biden's views, the needs of the people of Delaware and his own principles. 
 ''My guiding principle is not going to be the number of bills passed or my name on a whole bunch of legislation,'' Mr. Kaufman said, adding that ''there is no limit to what you can do if you don't have to get the credit.'' 
 ''I will work with senior senators,'' he said, ''help others move forward, make sure there is enough money to do what has to be done.''
 In a Senate dominated by lawyers and career public servants, Mr. Kaufman, who holds an undergraduate degree from Duke and an M.B.A. from the Wharton School, is one of only two engineers. (The other is Jack Reed, Democrat of Rhode Island.)
 What he calls his ''humanistic'' way of thinking he attributes largely to his Irish Catholic mother, a teacher, and his father, a secular Jew, a social worker and his hero.
 He and his three sisters were raised in Philadelphia as Catholics. After attending Mass on Sundays with their mother, they would return home to eat bagels and lox with their father and engage in wide-ranging discussions.
 ''I knew the world was changing,'' he recalled with a smile, ''when non-Jewish friends began to say, 'Let's go out and get bagels and lox.' ''

HEADLINE: Health Care Now

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN

 BODY:
The whole world is in recession. But the United States is the only wealthy country in which the economic catastrophe will also be a health care catastrophe -- in which millions of people will lose their health insurance along with their jobs, and therefore lose access to essential care.
 Which raises a question: Why has the Obama administration been silent, at least so far, about one of President Obama's key promises during last year's campaign -- the promise of guaranteed health care for all Americans? 
 Let's talk about the magnitude of the looming health care disaster.
 Just about all economic forecasts, including those of the Obama administration's own economists, say that we're in for a prolonged period of very high unemployment. And high unemployment means a sharp rise in the number of Americans without health insurance. 
 After the economy slumped at the beginning of this decade, five million people joined the ranks of the uninsured -- and that was with the unemployment rate peaking at only 6.3 percent. This time the Obama administration says that even with its stimulus plan, unemployment will reach 8 percent, and that it will stay above 6 percent until 2012. Many independent forecasts are even more pessimistic.
 Why, then, aren't we hearing more about ensuring health care access?
 Now, it's possible that those of us who care about this issue are reading too much into the administration's silence. But let me address three arguments that I suspect Mr. Obama is hearing against moving on health care, and explain why they're wrong.
 First, some people are arguing that a major expansion of health care access would just be too expensive right now, given the vast sums we're about to spend trying to rescue the economy. 
 But research sponsored by the Commonwealth Fund shows that achieving universal coverage with a plan similar to Mr. Obama's campaign proposals would add ''only'' about $104 billion to federal spending in 2010 -- not a small sum, of course, but not large compared with, say, the tax cuts in the Obama stimulus plan. 
 It's true that the cost of universal health care will be a continuing expense, reaching far into the future. But that has always been true, and Mr. Obama has always claimed that his health care plan was affordable. The temporary expenses of his stimulus plan shouldn't change that calculation.
 Second, some people in Mr. Obama's circle may be arguing that health care reform isn't a priority right now, in the face of economic crisis. 
 But helping families purchase health insurance as part of a universal coverage plan would be at least as effective a way of boosting the economy as the tax breaks that make up roughly a third of the stimulus plan -- and it would have the added benefit of directly helping families get through the crisis, ending one of the major sources of Americans' current anxiety. 
 Finally -- and this is, I suspect, the real reason for the administration's health care silence -- there's the political argument that this is a bad time to be pushing fundamental health care reform, because the nation's attention is focused on the economic crisis. But if history is any guide, this argument is precisely wrong. 
 Don't take my word for it. Rahm Emanuel, the White House chief of staff, has declared that ''you never want a serious crisis to go to waste.'' Indeed. F.D.R. was able to enact Social Security in part because the Great Depression highlighted the need for a stronger social safety net. And the current crisis presents a real opportunity to fix the gaping holes that remain in that safety net, especially with regard to health care.
 And Mr. Obama really, really doesn't want to repeat the mistakes of Bill Clinton, whose health care push failed politically partly because he moved too slowly: by the time his administration was ready to submit legislation, the economy was recovering from recession and the sense of urgency was fading.
 One more thing. There's a populist rage building in this country, as Americans see bankers getting huge bailouts while ordinary citizens suffer. 
 I agree with administration officials who argue that these financial bailouts are necessary (though I have problems with the specifics). But I also agree with Barney Frank, the chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, who argues that -- as a matter of political necessity as well as social justice -- aid to bankers has to be linked to a strengthening of the social safety net, so that Americans can see that the government is ready to help everyone, not just the rich and powerful.
 The bottom line, then, is that this is no time to let campaign promises of guaranteed health care be quietly forgotten. It is, instead, a time to put the push for universal care front and center. Health care now!

HEADLINE: Cleaner And Faster

BYLINE: By DAVID BROOKS

 BODY:
Throughout 2008, Larry Summers, the Harvard economist, built the case for a big but surgical stimulus package. Summers warned that a ''poorly provided fiscal stimulus can have worse side effects than the disease that is to be cured.'' So his proposal had three clear guidelines. 
 First, the stimulus should be timely. The money should go out ''almost immediately.'' Second, it should be targeted. It should help low- and middle-income people. Third, it should be temporary. Stimulus measures should not raise the deficits ''beyond a short horizon of a year or at most two.'' 
 Summers was proposing bold action, but his concept came with safeguards: focus on the task at hand, prevent the usual Washington splurge and limit long-term fiscal damage.
 Now Barack Obama is president, and Summers has become a top economic adviser. Yet the stimulus approach that has emerged on Capitol Hill abandoned the Summers parameters. 
 In a fateful decision, Democratic leaders merged the temporary stimulus measure with their permanent domestic agenda -- including big increases for Pell Grants, alternative energy subsidies and health and entitlement spending. The resulting package is part temporary and part permanent, part timely and part untimely, part targeted and part untargeted.
 It's easy to see why Democrats decided to do this. They could rush through permanent policies they believe in. Plus, they could pay for them with borrowed money. By putting a little of everything in the stimulus package, they avoid the pay-as-you-go rules that might otherwise apply to recurring costs.
 But they've created a sprawling, undisciplined smorgasbord, which has spun off a series of unintended consequences. First, by trying to do everything all it once, the bill does nothing well. The money spent on long-term domestic programs means there may not be enough to jolt the economy now (about $290 billion in spending is pushed off into 2011 and later). The money spent on stimulus, meanwhile, means there's not enough to truly reform domestic programs like health technology, schools and infrastructure. The measure mostly pumps more money into old arrangements.
 Second, by pumping so much money through government programs, the bill unleashes a tidal wave on state governments. A governor with a few-hundred-billion-dollar shortfall will suddenly have to administer an additional $4 billion or $5 billion. That money will be corrosive both when washing in, and when it disappears in a few years time. 
 Third, the muddle assures ideological confrontation. A stimulus package was always going to be controversial, because economists differ widely about whether or how a stimulus can work. But this bill also permanently alters the role of the federal government, thus guaranteeing a polarizing brawl at the very start of the Obama presidency. 
 Fourth, Summers's warnings about deficits have been put aside. There is no fiscal exit strategy. Instead, permanent spending commitments are entailed with no permanent funding stream to pay for them. 
 Fifth, new government expenditures on complex matters are being designed on a hasty, reckless timetable. As readers may know, the policy I am most passionate about is pre-K education. Yet I fervently hope that the Head Start expansion is dropped from this bill. A slapdash and shambolic expansion could discredit the whole idea.
 Wise heads are now trying to restore structure and safeguards to the enterprise. In testimony this week, Alice Rivlin, Bill Clinton's former budget director, raised the possibility of separating the temporary from the permanent measures and focusing independently on each. ''A long-term investment program should not be put together hastily and lumped in with the anti-recession package,'' Rivlin testified. ''The elements of the investment program must be carefully planned and will not create many jobs right away.''
 The best course is to return to the original Summers parameters -- temporary, targeted and timely -- thus making the stimulus cleaner and faster.
 Strip out the permanent government programs. Many of them are worthy, but we can have that debate another day. Make the short-term stimulus bigger. Many liberal economists have been complaining it is too small, so replace the permanent programs with something like a big payroll tax cut, which would help the working class. 
 Add in a fiscal exit strategy so the whole thing is budget neutral over the medium term. Finally, coordinate the stimulus package with plans to shore up the housing and financial markets. Until those come to life, no amount of stimulus will do any good. 
 This recession is scary and complicated. It's insane to try to tackle it and dozens of other complicated problems, all in one piece of legislation. Leadership involves prioritizing. Those who try to do everything at once will end up with a sprawling, lobbyist-driven mess that does nothing well.

HEADLINE: Talking Softly About Democracy Promotion

BYLINE: By HELENE COOPER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Here is one thing on which democracy experts agree: When Barack Obama took the oath of office last Tuesday, he did more in one instant, as a minority candidate, to promote the American ideal of democracy to the outside world than any of his predecessors ever could.
 In both developed and developing autocracies, the election of a minority candidate stands as a powerful example of the American democratic model. 
 But what concrete steps will Mr. Obama take to promote democracy? 
 The mixed results of President Bush's freedom agenda left some proponents queasy about even using the word ''democracy'' overseas. His administration got elections in Iraq and Afghanistan only after invading those countries, and it encouraged them in the Palestinian territories only to reject the results when Hamas, the militant Islamist organization, won.
 During his second inaugural address in 2005, Mr. Bush used soaring language to lay out his freedom agenda. The words ''freedom,'' ''free,'' and ''liberty'' appeared 49 times, as Mr. Bush expounded on democracy as a retrospective justification for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, and his vision of America's mission in the world.
 ''The survival of liberty in our land increasingly depends on the success of liberty in other lands,'' Mr. Bush said. ''The best hope for peace in our world is the expansion of freedom in all the world.''
 Now, some of Mr. Obama's aides are suggesting that he ''talk less and do more,'' in the words of Michael McFaul, who advises Mr. Obama on both Russia and democracy issues and is likely to be headed to the White House staff.
 ''President Bush delivered several lofty speeches explaining why the United States should promote freedom, yet Ayman Nour sits in jail in Egypt,'' Mr. McFaul said in a paper he prepared last year on how the United States should support democracy abroad. He was referring to the main opponent of President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt in the 2005 elections, who was imprisoned on fraud charges that Mr. Nour's supporters regarded as politically motivated.
 But ''rather than speeches or even grand goals,'' Mr. McFaul said, ''the next administration should seek to achieve small, concrete outcomes that advance political freedoms in very tangible ways and do so, without talking about doing so.''
 To be sure, Mr. Bush raised the issue of Mr. Nour with Mr. Mubarak as recently as last May, and he has that he believes Mr. Nour has been unjustly imprisoned.
 But Mr. Bush did not come to office in 2001 with big promises about democracy promotion; indeed, his initial foreign policy agenda was stingy on the nation-building front. After Sept. 11, 2001, Mr. Bush and his aides decided that autocratic regimes, particularly in the Middle East, fostered hopelessness that led to the attacks on the United States. 
 From then on, Mr. Bush's national security agenda elevated democracy promotion to be a central objective of foreign policy. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice followed her boss's 2005 inauguration freedom speech with one of her own, in Cairo a few months later. She called on America's closest allies in the Arab world, Egypt and Saudi Arabia, to embrace democracy by holding fair elections, releasing political prisoners and allowing free expression and rights for women.
 The trouble, according to Francis Fukuyama, a political economist at Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies, was that the United States was perceived as insincere, given the Iraq War, the Abu Ghraib prison scandal, the military prisons at Guantanamo Bay and other assorted policies. 
 ''The problem with Bush's legacy is they tied democracy promotion so much to the Iraq war justification and the war on terrorism that it made American policy look hypocritical,'' Mr. Fukuyama said. ''If you use the language that Bush used in the second inaugural, all of that soaring rhetoric, it's going to make you look stupid when Hamas comes to power.''
 He and other democracy experts do credit Mr. Bush with creating the Millennium Challenge Account, which greatly increased United States foreign aid to countries that practiced good government and met certain specific goals. In addition, Mr. Bush greatly increased the amount of money the United States spent to fight AIDS and malaria overseas, an initiative that -- which experts say are initiatives that can lead to democracy by first helping poor people get access to the basic tools they need to live. 
 Mr. Obama's aides say that he will probably continue the Millennium Challenge program. Beyond that, it is unclear what specific steps Mr. Obama intends to take on democracy promotion.
 Making good on his promise to shut down the detention camp at Guantanamo Bay could be viewed as a step towards democracy promotion, some experts said. Mr. Obama has also promised to increase United States foreign assistance to $50 billion by 2012. But he made that promise before the economic crisis erupted last fall, and fiscal constraints, along with America-first politics, could force him to cut back on foreign assistance instead.

HEADLINE: Albany and City Battle Over $270 Million Fund Meant for Low-Cost Housing

BYLINE: By MANNY FERNANDEZ

 BODY:
Tucked into Gov. David A. Paterson's budget proposal in December was a little-noticed measure authorizing the Battery Park City Authority to transfer up to $270 million in excess revenues to the state's general fund. The move, intended to help close the state's $15 billion deficit, would take effect March 1, according to state budget documents.
 But there was one problem: The Bloomberg administration was set to use the money to finance low- and moderately-priced housing in some of the city's poorest neighborhoods. The money was the main source of financing for the $400 million Affordable Housing Trust Fund, which was created in 2007 as part of the overhaul of a tax break for housing developers known as the 421a program. 
 Now, the surplus money from the authority, a state-controlled agency that oversees the 92-acre Battery Park City site in Lower Manhattan, has become the focus of a fight between the Bloomberg and Paterson administrations. Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, Governor Paterson and the city comptroller, William C. Thompson Jr., have joint oversight over the use of the surplus. 
 ''If you were to take all of the Battery Park City surplus and use it to help plug the hole in the state budget, you would end the Affordable Housing Trust Fund before it began,'' the City Council speaker, Christine C. Quinn, who worked to establish the trust fund, said in an interview on Wednesday.
 But a spokesman for Laura L. Anglin, the state budget director, said the governor's proposal did not seek to take all the surplus away from the city. The spokesman, Jeffrey Gordon, said the proposal entailed raising a total of $540 million by letting the authority issue up to $500 million in bonds. The other $40 million would come from the Battery Park City Authority surplus. The state and the city would each receive $270 million to use as they see fit. 
 ''The governor shares the city's commitment to building affordable housing, and will continue to seek opportunities to maintain this longstanding commitment within the current fiscal climate,'' Mr. Gordon said in a statement on Thursday.
 Still, city officials and advocates for low-income housing are skeptical of the state's plan. One city official said the governor's proposal to issue bonds to increase the surplus in the joint fund seemed like an unwise financial move, and likened it to someone's taking out a mortgage to pay for groceries.
 Both Mr. Bloomberg and Mr. Thompson are opposed to the state's plan to use the Battery Park City surplus, as are several advocates and nonprofit developers of low-cost housing. They said that the housing trust fund was a crucial ''gap filler'' at a time when the recession had all but crippled the financing of so-called affordable housing.
 ''While I recognize the need in these tough fiscal times to identify all available revenue sources, state and city budget challenges should be met without sacrificing this much-needed commitment to affordable housing,'' Mr. Thompson said in a statement.
 The negotiations over the surplus also appear to have been marred by poor communication between City Hall and Albany, with each side saying it has had few details about the other's intentions and plans. 
 Mr. Gordon said that when state budget officials reached out to the mayor's budget office in November to discuss the state budget, and the use of the surplus in particular, no one informed the state that the city had earmarked the money. ''We were not aware that there were intentions to use this particular money for affordable housing,'' he said. 
 A spokesman for the mayor, Marc LaVorgna, said he was not aware of the conversations, but said, ''We have been using the money for affordable housing for the last three years, and we never intended to change that.''
 The Battery Park City Authority collects rent and payments from landlords in Battery Park City made in lieu of taxes. After paying expenses, the authority has for years put its surplus into a Joint Purpose Fund, which is held by the authority and made up of annual surpluses from previous years. In October, it had a total of $215 million, according to authority documents. It must be used for ''purposes unanimously decided upon'' by the mayor, the city comptroller and the governor, who controls the authority, the documents state.
 The city has already used part of the surplus for housing. In 2005, the mayor and Mr. Thompson called for financing 4,500 units of low-cost housing by using $130 million in Battery Park City surplus money, a plan that Gov. George E. Pataki and the authority's board approved in 2006. 
 About $100 million of the $130 million has been used so far for low-cost housing, helping to finance more than 2,350 units around the city. 
 The idea for the Affordable Housing Trust Fund came about as part of negotiations with the Bloomberg administration, the City Council, housing advocates and real estate developers to revamp the 421a program, a popular tax break for housing developers, to encourage the construction of thousands of apartments for low-income residents. Gov. Eliot Spitzer signed the legislation overhauling the program in 2007.
 The new program established the fund -- the city said it intended the fund to have $400 million -- to develop low- and moderately-priced housing, primarily in the city's 15 poorest neighborhoods. But the negotiations and the legislation did not specify a source of financing. The city proposed using the Battery Park City surplus. Mr. Thompson had agreed in theory to it, and city officials said that the governor at the time, Mr. Spitzer, had also supported the idea.
 But the city was slow to finalize the financing arrangements of the trust fund in a document, which has further complicated the fight over the surplus.
 Adam Weinstein, president of Phipps Houses, a nonprofit group that owns and manages low-cost housing in the city, said that he had been relying on financing from the trust fund.
 ''It's troubling news,'' Mr. Weinstein said. ''It's troubling for projects that are more affordable and therefore rely more heavily on this funding.''

HEADLINE: Democrats Set Sights on Republican Senators Who Oppose Stimulus Plan

BYLINE: By JACKIE CALMES and DAVID M. HERSZENHORN; Adam Nagourney contributed reporting.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Senator Judd Gregg awoke to the bad news on Thursday morning that a coalition of Democratic groups had planned to run television advertisements in his state to pressure him to support President Obama's economic recovery plan.
 Mr. Gregg, a third-term Republican from New Hampshire, is one of five Republican senators who are targets; all face re-election in 2010.
 ''Those groups don't impress me,'' he said in an interview. ''I'm trying to participate constructively, help the new president where I can be helpful and be part of the loyal opposition where I disagree with him.'' 
 On the morning after the House passed an $819 billion package of stimulus spending and tax cuts without a single Republican vote in favor, the action moved to the Senate, where Republicans began mobilizing for a fight. Mindful of the danger of simply opposing a popular new president at a time of national distress, they were intent on coming to the floor with proposals of their own to substantively change the bill, including additional tax cuts and reduced spending. 
 ''We do need a very robust and aggressive stimulus package,'' Mr. Gregg said, ''but we need one that works and is focused on the problem, which is housing, and that essentially doesn't end up aggravating the long-term debt of the country'' with spending that extends beyond the two-year life of the recovery plan. 
 The Republican said he had earlier called Mr. Obama's senior economic adviser, Lawrence H. Summers, and ''gave him my thoughts on how this should be reoriented toward real estate.'' 
 With coordinated news conferences, speeches and television appearances, Republican senators said they would push hard to amend the House package that Mr. Obama supports, including with a proposal to allow all creditworthy homeowners to refinance their mortgages at interest rates of 4.5 percent or lower.
 Given Democrats' majority margins in the House and Senate, Mr. Obama is expected to get the stimulus measure he wants. But he also wants some Republican support in keeping with his separate campaign promise to change Washington's polarized ways. In his latest overture, Mr. Obama invited senators from both parties to the White House to watch the Super Bowl on Sunday, the eve of the Senate debate. 
 Republicans, for their part, are wary of bucking a president whose election marked a repudiation of his Republican predecessor's policies. That is especially true of those, like Mr. Gregg, who could face tough races next year. In both parties, some are already raising the question: Might 2010 be like 1934, or 1994?
 In 1934, the Democratic Party added to its majorities in the House and Senate after Republicans opposed the New Deal economic program of President Franklin D. Roosevelt. But in 1994, the Democratic Party lost control of Congress after Republicans unanimously opposed President Bill Clinton's deficit-reduction plan and then campaigned against Democrats for passing it.
 Republicans profess to be unconcerned. House Republicans on Thursday headed off to a retreat at The Homestead, a Virginia resort, still celebrating their unanimous stand -- despite Mr. Obama's visit to the Capitol to seek their support -- against a package that in their view has too much big-government spending and too few tax cuts. Their unsuccessful substitute was entirely of tax cuts.
 In a congratulatory memorandum to his colleagues early Thursday, the House minority leader, Representative John A. Boehner of Ohio wrote: ''House Republicans said we would stand up for American taxpayers at this time of economic hardship for our nation. And last night, standing together, that's exactly what we did.'' 
 Vin Weber, a former Republican congressman who remains a party strategist, said he believed Republican incumbents faced ''minimal risk'' because a Democratic package would ultimately become law. ''If Republicans blocked it, if they had the capacity to actually kill it,'' Mr. Weber said, ''then that would be a different matter.'' 
 Stuart Rothenberg, a nonpartisan political analyst, agreed. ''I think what the House Republicans did was totally right,'' Mr. Rothenberg said. ''There is no political benefit for them in being politically co-opted by the new president,'' given that most come from districts drawn to be packed with conservative Republican voters.
 But, as Mr. Rothenberg added, things are different for Republican senators, who represent entire states that generally are more demographically, socially and politically diverse. And while Mr. Obama did not get a majority last November in many House Republican districts, he did win in many Republican senators' states, including Mr. Gregg's. 
 Voters in New Hampshire also ousted Senator John E. Sununu, Mr. Gregg's former Republican colleague, last November, signaling that Mr. Gregg would be next in Democrats' sights. The once overwhelmingly Republican state has increasingly trended Democratic. As recently as 2004 its governor, two senators and two House members were Republicans. Now Mr. Gregg is the only Republican left.
 Earlier this week, Mr. Gregg broke with most Senate Republicans to support Mr. Obama's nominee for Treasury secretary, Timothy F. Geithner. And Mr. Obama's respect for him is such that Mr. Gregg was approached about becoming commerce secretary, the senator's office confirmed on Thursday.
 But Mr. Gregg opposed the Democratic stimulus plan in the Senate Finance Committee on Tuesday. The only Republican who voted for it there was Senator Olympia J. Snowe of Maine, a moderate who is also a target of the coming pro-Obama television advertisements.
 Mr. Gregg calls himself ''a minor player'' in the effort of the Senate Republican leader, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, to propose fixes to the Democrats' package.
 Among the changes, Republicans would double to $15,000 the Democrats' proposed homebuyer tax credit, add more tax cuts for businesses, provide aid to the states as loans instead of grants and strip out various spending initiatives. The Republicans complained Tuesday that Congressional Democrats had reduced the share of tax cuts in their package to one-third, down from the 40 percent that Mr. Obama initially indicated he supported.
 Congressional Democrats, meanwhile, were chafing at the White House talk of accommodating Republicans in the wake of the House Republicans' unanimous opposition. Although Mr. Obama at one point said he hoped for as many as 80 Senate votes, on Thursday the Democratic majority leader, Harry Reid of Nevada, said Democrats would be satisfied to pass the bill regardless of how many Republicans supported it. 
 ''Passing a bill -- however we pass it -- is going to put this country on a road to new jobs, and bring some vitality to the economy which is lagging,'' Mr. Reid said.
 Mr. Obama's campaign manager, David Plouffe, said both Senate and House Republicans should be worried about appearing as obstructionists. Mr. Plouffe said of Republican opposition, ''It's almost as if the election didn't happen and that the message wasn't received: that people in Washington need to cooperate a lot more than they have in the past.''
 But Mr. Gregg insists cooperation is a two-way street. ''I'd like to see the stimulus done right and I'd like to be able to vote for it,'' he said. But politics aside, he added, ''If it's not done right, I won't.'' 

CORRECTION-DATE: February 2, 2009

 CORRECTION:
An article on Friday about Republican senators who are under political pressure to support President Obama's economic stimulus program misidentified the committee where one of them, Senator Judd Gregg of New Hampshire, voted on Tuesday against the spending portion of the Democratic legislative package. It was the Senate Appropriations Committee, not the Senate Finance Committee.

A recent decision by President Obama points to his possible support of an increase in ''progressive federalism,'' possibly easing delicate relations between federal and state government. Before, the general theme was that the best law comes from Washington. Page A13
RISE IN SUICIDE AMONG SOLDIERS
For the first time since the Vietnam War, the suicide rate for soldiers in the United States has surpassed that of civilians. Last year, 128 soldiers killed themselves. Army officials said the rate had risen for the fourth consecutive year. The Army offered no specific reason, but acknowledged that 15-month deployments to war zones played a role. Page A14

HEADLINE: BANKER BONUSES ARE 'SHAMEFUL,' OBAMA DECLARES

BYLINE: By SHERYL GAY STOLBERG and STEPHEN LABATON; John Harwood contributed reporting.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
President Obama branded Wall Street bankers ''shameful'' on Thursday for giving themselves nearly $20 billion in bonuses as the economy was deteriorating and the government was spending billions to bail out some of the nation's most prominent financial institutions.
 ''There will be time for them to make profits, and there will be time for them to get bonuses,'' Mr. Obama said during an appearance in the Oval Office with Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner. ''Now's not that time. And that's a message that I intend to send directly to them, I expect Secretary Geithner to send to them.'' 
 It was a pointed -- if calculated -- flash of anger from the president, who frequently railed against excesses in executive compensation on the campaign trail. He struck his populist tone as he confronted the possibility of having to ask Congress for additional large sums of money, beyond the $700 billion already authorized, to prop up the financial system, even as he pushes Congress to move quickly on a separate economic stimulus package that could cost taxpayers as much as $900 billion. 
 This week alone, American companies reported as many as 65,000 job cuts, and public anger is rising over reports of profligate spending by banks and investment firms that are receiving help from the $700 billion bailout fund. About half of that money is still available, but the new administration has yet to announce how it will use it, and many analysts think it will take far more to stabilize the banking system. 
 Should Mr. Obama have to go to Congress to seek more money for the bailout fund to avert the failure of more banks, he would most likely encounter opposition within both parties and demands for tighter restrictions on pay for executives of institutions that receive government assistance. 
 Mr. Geithner has already signaled a willingness to impose stricter compensation limits as part of a revamped approach to dealing with the banking crisis, but with his strong words on Thursday, Mr. Obama seemed intent on reassuring Congress and the public that he would step up the pressure on bankers before granting them additional assistance.
 Mr. Obama was reacting to a report by the New York State comptroller that found financial executives had received an estimated $18.4 billion in bonuses for 2008, less than for the previous several years but the same level of bonuses as they received in 2004, when times were flush. 
 ''That is the height of irresponsibility,'' Mr. Obama said. ''It is shameful. And part of what we're going to need is for the folks on Wall Street who are asking for help to show some restraint and show some discipline and show some sense of responsibility.''
 The Obama administration and lawmakers have begun to consider ways to control executive pay; the bailout fund, known as the Troubled Asset Relief Program, or TARP, would be the main vehicle for exerting such control. The administration of former President George W. Bush issued guidelines last October to try to control executive pay at companies receiving government help, but so far they have done little to curb large salaries.
 During his confirmation hearings, Mr. Geithner said the administration is preparing rules that would require executives at companies receiving taxpayer money to agree that any compensation above a certain amount -- he did not specify how much -- be ''paid in restricted stock or similar form'' that could not be liquidated or sold until the government had been repaid.
 Some lawmakers, meanwhile, have said they are considering so-called ''clawback'' provisions that could be invoked by the government to take back bonuses and executive pay from officials at companies that encountered problems.
 In the meantime, public outrage is already forcing some companies to rein in their lavish spending. John A. Thain, the former Merrill Lynch executive who was forced out of Bank of America, said this week he would reimburse Bank of America for an expensive renovation of his office that included an $87,000 area rug and $35,000 commode.
 But it took the urging of the Obama administration to force Citigroup, which received an infusion of taxpayer funds last year, to abandon plans to buy a $50 million corporate jet. On Thursday, Mr. Obama made reference to the jet, without singling out Citigroup by name; his remarks came one day after the president met at the White House with business leaders, including Richard D. Parsons, the new chairman of Citigroup.
 On Capitol Hill, Senator Christopher J. Dodd of Connecticut, the chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, issued his own warning on Thursday, saying companies would be summoned to testify if taxpayer money was involved.
 ''Whether it was used directly or indirectly, this infuriates the American people and rightly so,'' Mr. Dodd said. ''So I say to anyone else who does it, if you do it, I'm going to bring you before the committee.''
 There is also political pressure to rein in pay in industries beyond banks and investment firms. The pressure reflects the substantial disparities between pay increases for senior executives, the low rate of wage growth for workers and the frequent disconnect between compensation and the long-term strategic success or failure of corporations. 
 Mr. Obama's message on Thursday was reinforced by Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., who pledged in an interview with CNBC and The New York Times that the government would spend the remaining $350 billion of the troubled assets money ''wisely and prudently and transparently.''
 Mr. Biden said that he, like the president, was outraged by reports of large bonuses going to Wall Street executives.
 ''I'd like to throw these guys in the brig,'' he said. ''They're thinking the same old thing that got us here, greed. They're thinking, 'Take care of me.' ''

HEADLINE: From New Administration, Signals of Broader Role for States

BYLINE: By JOHN SCHWARTZ

 BODY:
The Obama administration seems to be open to a movement known as ''progressive federalism,'' in which governors and activist state attorneys general have been trying to lead the way on environmental initiatives, consumer protection and other issues, several constitutional experts say.
 A recent decision by President Obama that could open the way for California and other states to set their own limits on greenhouse gases from cars and trucks represents a shift in the delicate and often acrimonious relationship between the federal government and the states, legal experts say, possibly signaling a new view of federalism. 
 ''I think it's quite significant,'' said Samuel Issacharoff, a professor of constitutional law at New York University law school. ''It shows the Obama administration's more benign view of government intervention,'' Professor Issacharoff said, and ''may indicate a spirit of cooperative federalism'' in which Washington will look to the states for new ideas and even a measure of guidance. 
 Tom Miller, the attorney general of Iowa, who met with the transition team in December to discuss federalism and other issues, said he believed the Obama administration would ''usher in a new era in federal-state relations.'' Members of the new administration, Mr. Miller said, ''are open to what we're talking about, what we're thinking.'' They also appreciate, he said, the fact that state attorneys general often achieve a level of bipartisan cooperation when they band together to pursue lawsuits.
 The general trend under previous administrations had favored federal pre-emption, the belief that the best law comes from Washington, a concept still favored by business leaders. 
 William L. Kovacs, a vice president for environmental and regulatory issues at the United States Chamber of Commerce, said free-for-all federalism was bad for business and would lead to a ''patchwork of laws impacting a troubled industry.'' Detroit, Mr. Kovacs said, would have to produce different cars for different parts of the country, and the environmental protection agency would grow tremendously to meet the new regulatory burden.
 Many liberal thinkers skeptical of states' rights and state actions since the days of segregation have begun to see that the states, to use Justice Louis Brandeis's words from the 1930s, can ''serve as a laboratory; and try novel social and economic experiments without risk to the rest of the country.''
 Professor Issacharoff said states were often quicker than Washington to spot a problem when it emerged, and so ''it may be the states that have the best initial take on it, and try different regulatory methods until we fasten on a single national solution.''
 States have taken up the challenge of consumer protection, addressing issues like predatory lending well before the federal government took action, and often achieving reforms by suing the federal government to force it to enforce its laws and through legal settlements with industry. In October, 11 states reached an $8.4 billion settlement with Countrywide Financial in which it agreed to modify home loans to help people at risk of foreclosure. And in 2006, 49 states and the District of Columbia reached a $325 million settlement with the Ameriquest Mortgage company to change its policies. 
 Attorneys general also pressured major universities to adopt a code of conduct regarding their relationships with student lending companies. Eliot Spitzer, the former New York attorney general, achieved a settlement with the pharmaceutical company GlaxoSmithKline in 2004 in which it agreed to release more information about the risks to patients that had come out in clinical trials. 
 The Obama administration, then, is embracing a states' rights movement that a liberal could love. ''The pro-regulatory folks realized in the last eight years that the old line on federal power being the only good power wasn't correct,'' said William Marshall, a law professor at the University of North Carolina who was deputy White House counsel in the Clinton administration and a former solicitor general of Ohio.
 ''It doesn't mean you abandon the federal regulatory process -- you don't, of course,'' Mr. Marshall said. ''But you treat it as a floor and not a ceiling.''
 He added, ''The Obama administration is signaling that state regulations may very well complement federal regulations, and they can both work together to achieve important goals.''
 Still, James E. Tierney, the director of the National State Attorneys General Program at Columbia University Law School, cautioned against reading too much into a single presidential directive. ''I don't think we have a hallmark, sweeping view of states' rights here,'' Mr. Tierney said. He said ''the Obama administration is going to take these one at a time'' and ''will be with the states as long as the states fit in with his view of the national interest.''
 And Walter Dellinger, a solicitor general in the Clinton administration, said that the economic rise of the United States, compared with Europe's, in the 1950s could be attributed in large part to the unified American market. Now Europe's markets have unified, Mr. Dellinger noted. ''There is a serious risk that if we decentralize regulations too much, we will, ironically, switch places with Europe,'' he said.
 Mr. Tierney, who is a former Maine attorney general, said that while he was an advocate for state power, there were areas where federal power should nonetheless hold sway. ''What the federal government ought to do,'' he said, ''is open the door to the states, and let the states enforce the law that the federal government promulgates.'' 
 He added, ''This is the opportunity to have the attorneys general join their own government instead of suing their own government.''

HEADLINE: A Super Bowl Victory, Answering a Prayer for Wings

BYLINE: By JIM DWYER. 
E-mail: dwyer@nytimes.com

 BODY:
''Here,'' said Eddie Byrnes. 
 He waved his hand at a bare wall in a wholesale food warehouse in Brooklyn.
 ''This is where they usually keep the wings,'' said Mr. Byrnes, who buys food for the Kettle Black Bar and Restaurant in Bay Ridge. 
 He squinted at a stack of boxes nearby that were full of chicken parts, all of them wrong. Drumsticks. Breasts. Thighs. Backs. 
 No wings.
 ''Not one box,'' he reported.
 Mr. Byrnes, who describes himself, accurately, as resembling Santa Claus, but with double earrings on the left side, spent a good part of this week prowling the wholesale meat markets in search of fresh chicken wings. Five months ago, when the football season began, he said, he was paying $1.10 per pound of wings. On Tuesday, in the season's final week, he paid $1.86. 
 By Thursday, it seemed that they were nowhere to be found at any price: Even at Jetro Cash & Carry, a major food supplier to restaurants in the city, the chicken wing wing of its warehouse on Hamilton Avenue was bare. 
 ''If the Giants were still in the Super Bowl, it would be much worse,'' Mr. Byrnes said. ''When they were in it last year, we went through 35 cases. That's 1,400 pounds.''
 He remembered a not-so-distant past when wings cost 29 cents a pound and were given away free as the bar food most likely to parch the throat. Now, Kettle Black sells six wings for $5.95. The National Chicken Council reports that eight billion wings are consumed in the United States every year, but that chicken production is down 5 percent, because of high feed prices. 
 This year's shortage was the subject of an investigative report on ''The Colbert Report'' on Comedy Central. The anchorman, Stephen Colbert, brought in an expert from the chicken industry, who tried to explain that it was a simple matter of the demand for wings during Super Bowl week exceeding the supply. 
 Mr. Colbert was not having any fancy-pants economic-law explanations, not at a moment of crisis. 
 ''What other country,'' he demanded, ''can we invade to fix this?'' 
 Assured by the expert that the United States produces the most poultry in the world and is actually the ''Saudi Arabia of chicken,'' Mr. Colbert thought there might be another way to meet the demand.
 ''Is there any chance we will have to release some wings from the strategic chicken wing reserve?'' he asked.
 Such a move would not come in time for Mr. Byrnes, who stood in the warehouse door on Thursday, plotting his next step. To encourage people to beat the rush, the bar had posted a sign offering a 10 percent discount to customers who placed orders by last Sunday for their Super Bowl wings. But the discount period had expired. And calls to other wholesalers were unavailing. 
 ''I was in the loading area here last week when a whole tractor-trailer of chicken came in,'' Mr. Byrnes said. ''In an entire truck of breasts, drumsticks, thighs, only five cases of wings! Who is running away with the wings?''
 He was one of many restaurant people in Jetro, hoping that a glimpse of wings would be followed by a busy weekend of thirsty and hungry football fans. Near the hot sauce aisle, the owner of another bar in Bay Ridge flagged Mr. Byrnes down and they swapped shoptalk. The other man reported that he had plenty of wings. But they were all frozen, preflavored or breaded. Mr. Byrnes said he buys only fresh because the restaurant has its own recipes. After the competitor walked away, Mr. Byrnes smiled. 
 ''Wait until the world finds out he's doing frozen,'' he said.
 As Mr. Byrnes headed for the exit empty-handed, Jason Cortiella, the meat manager at Jetro, called to him. ''Hey, man,'' Mr. Cortiella said. ''Did you get the wings I left for you?''
 It turned out that Mr. Cortiella had stashed 10 cases of fresh wings on a high shelf, out of sight. A forklift lowered them to Mr. Byrnes, who wheeled them to the cashier on a cart, looking very pleased. The total came to $744 for 400 pounds of wings. 
 In the time it took him to glance at the ceiling, Mr. Byrnes had done the calculations. ''That's $1.86 a pound,'' he said. ''Same price as Tuesday.''
 He paid. Behind him, a man from a restaurant in Prospect Heights eyed the cases stacked on Mr. Byrnes's cart. 
 ''Oooh,'' he said. ''Can I have one?'' He laughed a little bit. But he wasn't kidding. Neither was Mr. Byrnes, who kept rolling, trying to be inconspicuous, just another regular guy who happened to be wheeling gold ingots across a parking lot on their way to a deep-fat fryer.

HEADLINE: Diners to Get a Quick Guide to Cleanliness

BYLINE: By GLENN COLLINS

 BODY:
For the first time, the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene will compel the city's nearly 25,000 restaurants to publicly post inspectors' cleanliness ratings, which have previously been available only online or at the department. Rating signs, to be supplied by the city, will be required to be visible from the street, either in a restaurant window or vestibule.
 The agency also plans to switch to a letter-grade system similar to that used for years in Los Angeles (using the letters A, B and C for passing inspection grades). The new rules, which will be part of a broad revamping of inspections, will be put in place over the next two years, giving restaurant operators time to comply. 
 The department said that Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg signed off on the program as part of the executive budget announced Friday. He has scheduled a Saturday news conference to announce the new procedures. 
 ''We expect this will improve our inspection program,'' said Dr. Thomas R. Frieden, the city health commissioner. ''It will encourage restaurants to be cleaner and inform people so they can make better choices about where to eat.'' 
 Though the health department will lose millions of dollars as well as staff members in next year's budget, Dr. Frieden said he did not expect the inspection program to be cut because, he said, ''it will result in more revenues for the city and fewer episodes of illness that the city might have to pay for.'' 
 In addition, the commissioner said he hoped to hire 45 additional restaurant inspectors, adding to the current total of 140, over the next two years, at a cost of $4.8 million, to help implement the new program. 
 Dr. Frieden said it would improve the quality of the 800 million restaurant meals the department said were served in the city yearly. ''Every day more than a thousand people get sick from eating in restaurants,'' Dr. Frieden said. 
 Some in the restaurant industry said they needed to study the details of the program, but ''a major objection we have is that an inspection is a snapshot, it reflects a condition on a particular day, but not necessarily a long-term condition,'' said E. Charles Hunt, executive vice president of the New York City chapters of the New York State Restaurant Association. ''It would be unfair to make owners post these ratings if a temporary judgment had been corrected.''
 Mr. Hunt added that he was concerned that the department would try to use the new system to bolster city revenue. ''This could make it even worse for restaurant owners, making it more costly,'' he said. 
 But Elliott S. Marcus, an associate health commissioner, said the department did not plan to raise the schedule of fines, from $200 to $2,000, adding that restaurants scoring an A will pay less in fines. 
 ''Possibly this presents another concern to restaurant owners in a very difficult economic time,'' Angus McIndoe, proprietor of a 160-seat restaurant at 258 West 44th Street, said of the new system. ''But you have to take health concerns seriously. If it makes things better for the general public, then maybe it will be better for us.'' 
 Dr. Frieden credited State Senator Jeffrey D. Klein for pressing the adoption of the new system. ''It gives the public a clear and easily digestible statement about cleanliness,'' Senator Klein said. ''And it will have chilling effect on restaurants, since the public will force them to comply.'' 
 Currently, city restaurants receive one inspection a year and are judged according to a point-ratings system. 
 Under the plan, restaurants receiving an A grade would stay on a yearly inspection cycle. Those with B grades would get two inspections, and those with C grades would get three. Those with public-health hazards will be closed until violations are corrected.

HEADLINE: A Rise in Pessimism in the Corner Office

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS. 
Floyd Norris's blog on finance and economics is at nytimes.com/norris.

DATELINE: DAVOS, Switzerland 

 BODY:
 CORPORATE chief executives have lost confidence in the outlook for their companies. And educated elites around the world have lost confidence in the chief executives.
 Surveys showing those two trends were released this week at the World Economic Forum here, adding to the already glum sentiment of executives gathered for the forum.
 The survey of chief executives, by PricewaterhouseCoopers, found the proportion of corporate bosses who were highly confident about increasing revenue over the next 12 months had plunged from a year ago in virtually every country. 
 The survey was taken during the final quarter of 2008. Ian Powell, the chairman of PricewaterhouseCoopers's British arm, said that throughout the world the chief executives interviewed later in the quarter were less optimistic than those who replied earlier.
 The decline in executive confidence was most notable in China, where fewer than a third said they were very confident. In the survey taken in late 2007, nearly three-quarters of chief executives felt that way.
 The firm quoted Ren Jianxin, the president of the China National Chemical Corporation, a state-owned company, as saying a financial crisis had led to a global economic recession. ''Whether a country, an enterprise or an individual, you can hardly escape it, and our company is no exception,'' he said.
 Only in India did a large proportion of chief executives remain confident, but even there the number fell to 70 percent from 90 percent.
 ''The last downturn was a cyclical downturn,'' said Mukesh Ambani, the chief executive of Reliance Industries, an Indian company. ''This is a structural downturn. When you have cyclical events, things go up and come down. When you have a structural event, something fundamental changes. Our view is this is going to shake up fundamentals in a whole host of global economic areas.''
 In the United States, the proportion of highly confident executives fell to 13 percent from 36 percent. In France, the figure dipped to 5 percent.
 The survey of public opinion was conducted by Edelman, a public relations firm. It found a sharp drop in the proportion of people willing to believe what chief executives said about their own companies. 
 The survey was restricted to people who were college-educated and in the top quarter of their country in terms of income, and who said they followed public affairs. The survey was conducted in December.
 People in Mexico appeared to have the most confidence in the veracity of corporate bosses, with 43 percent saying they would find a statement by such a person regarding his company either very credible or extremely credible. But that was down from 61 percent a year earlier.
 In the United States, the figure fell to a six-year low of 17 percent, from 23 percent. But that was still better than in France, at 13 percent. Most major countries showed that about a fifth of the people found the chief executives believable.
 The results of the two surveys showed a rising doubt about the world's economic system, a fact that troubled many of those who gathered here.
 Tony Blair, the former British prime minister, said in one session, on ''the values behind market capitalism,'' that he had run into an old friend who told him: ''See, I told you. Capitalism is going to end.''
 Mr. Blair said that was wrong. ''The free enterprise system has not failed,'' he said. ''The financial system has failed.''

HEADLINE: An Attempt to Avoid a Shelter Has a Happy Ending

BYLINE: By MANNY FERNANDEZ

 BODY:
In the Bronx, a hard-luck borough with the city's highest unemployment rate, 9.6 percent, and its lowest median household income, $32,409 a year, one financial obstacle can make a terrible difference.
For Raquel Fernandez, it was $1,238.
Ms. Fernandez, a 35-year-old single mother of two, faced eviction last year for nonpayment of rent. She was living in an apartment on Sedgwick Avenue with her two children, when she found herself unable to pay the $925 monthly rent. 
Her financial troubles stemmed in part from one literal misstep: she fell on an escalator at a Lower East Side subway station one day in 2005 and injured her back. She underwent surgery, but continues to have back problems.
''Sometimes I have a lot of pain,'' Ms. Fernandez said. ''Sometimes I can't get up out of bed.''
She had been working at two jobs, days as a home attendant and nights as a waitress, but was unable to continue working after the accident. She started receiving Supplemental Security Income and Social Security disability benefits both for her and for her older son, Nicholas, 6, who had a kidney removed when he was an infant. Because she was receiving the Supplemental Security Income, her previous city welfare benefits were ended.
She struggled to pay her bills and the rent, and ended up owing $4,363 in back rent by June, when she received an eviction notice.
''She was really strained,'' said Jodie Darnell, Ms. Fernandez's social worker at New Alternatives for Children, a nonprofit health and social services agency. ''She started out impoverished to begin with, and when she lost the ability to work, that was a huge problem.''
The boys' fathers do not contribute any child support.
But Ms. Fernandez eventually found a new place to live, a two-bedroom apartment on East 176th Street in the Bronx. The rent was $1,238.
A Section 8 voucher, a federal housing subsidy that pays a majority of a tenant's rent, would help her afford the apartment, limiting her monthly share to $348.
But there was a problem. A security deposit of one month's rent was required. It was $1,238 she did not have.
Unable to come up with the deposit, she figured she had only one option: return to the family homeless shelter on Lenox Avenue in Manhattan where she and her boys had lived from February 2005 to April 2006 after she and a companion fell behind in the rent on a previous apartment.
Nicholas was a few days shy of turning 3 and her younger son, Enmanuel, had just turned 1 when they entered the shelter. ''I was scared, because that's my first time going in a homeless shelter,'' Ms. Fernandez said. ''I've never seen a situation like that.''
She did not want to go back. And she would end up not having to do so.
In July, Ms. Darnell applied for and received a grant from The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund. New Alternatives for Children is a member of the Federation of Protestant Welfare Agencies, one of the seven agencies supported by the Neediest Cases Fund. It was not a particularly large grant, but it was the right amount at the right time: $1,238, for Ms. Fernandez's security deposit.
''One day she called me and she said, 'You have to come over here to my office,' '' Ms. Fernandez said of Ms. Darnell. ''And then when I go over there she showed me the check, and I said, 'Oh my God.' ''
She and her boys -- Nicholas and Enmanuel, now 4 -- moved into the apartment on East 176th Street, in a neighborhood called, it turns out, Mount Hope.

HEADLINE: Economic Dive Deepens, Giving Stimulus Urgency

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE

 BODY:
The economy shrank at an accelerating pace late last year, the government reported on Friday, adding to the urgency of a stimulus package capable of bringing the country back from a recession that appears to be deepening. 
 The actual decline in the gross domestic product -- at a 3.8 percent annual rate -- fell short of the 5 to 6 percent that most economists had expected for the fourth quarter. But that was because consumption collapsed so quickly that goods piled up in inventory, unsold but counted as part of the nation's output.
 ''The drop in spending was so fast, so rapid, that production could not be cut fast enough,'' said Nigel Gault, chief domestic economist at IHS Global Insight. ''That is happening now, and the contraction in the current quarter, as a result, will probably exceed 5 percent.'' 
 The dismal fourth quarter, and the likelihood of more of the same through the spring, are fueling discussion among policy makers and politicians over the best way to spend the soon-to-be-authorized federal money. 
 Some caution that President Obama's proposals try to achieve too many objectives -- for example, broader health care coverage and energy efficiency -- at the expense of focusing tax dollars on the core issue of job creation. By this argument, more should be spent on things like infrastructure repair, either directly or by channeling money to the states for projects now delayed for lack of adequate tax revenue. 
 Others argue that the best bang for the buck would come from a stimulus package devoted mainly to tax cuts rather than public investment. The breakdown in the $819 billion bill that the House approved on Wednesday and the Senate will take up next week is two-thirds spending, one-third tax cuts. 
 The president took a different approach in a press conference on Friday. Seizing on the damaging fourth-quarter figures and the prospect of an even weaker first quarter, he called the contraction ''a continuing disaster'' for working families and pushed Congress to act quickly to provide relief. 
 Even with the help of swelling inventories, the 3.8 percent contraction, adjusted for inflation and representing all of the nation's economic activity, was the largest quarterly drop in the nation's output since the 1982 recession.
 Business investment, commercial construction, home building and exports all fell steeply, most of them doing so for the first time since the recession began 13 months ago. Data released this week suggested that the decline had continued. As for consumer spending, in only one other quarter since records were first kept in 1947 have final sales of goods and services produced in America fallen so much. 
 ''Consumer spending is often held up as the engine of growth, and we are now experiencing the second-largest contraction on record,'' said Ben Herzon, an economist at Macroeconomic Advisers in St. Louis, referring to the 7.6 percent drop in spending in the midst of the 1974-75 recession, and 5.1 percent now.
 Christina D. Romer, chairwoman of the president's Council of Economic Advisers, said in a statement that ''aggressive, well-designed fiscal stimulus is critical to reversing this severe decline.'' She did not describe the elements of a well-designed fiscal stimulus, but the vast majority of the nation's economists agree that one is necessary, and soon.
 Virtually none dispute that the usual route to recovery, cheap credit, has failed to work this time -- not when lenders are pulling back, despite prodding from the Federal Reserve, and borrowers are focused more on paying down debt and building up savings. 
 ''I'm hoping the fiscal stimulus will be a catalyst to reignite the private sector,'' said Stuart Hoffman, chief economist at the PNC Bank Corporation in Pittsburgh. ''My hope is that as the fiscal stimulus kicks in, people will begin to spend and invest more, modestly anyway, in the second half of the year.''
 Absent a large stimulus package, most economists expect the nation's output to shrink not only in the first half of the year, but in the second half as well. In April, the recession would become the longest since the 1930s. Until now, the record, 16 months, was shared by the severe recessions of 1974-75 and 1981-82. This one began in December 2007 as employment peaked and began to fall. 
 ''We are in the thick of it now,'' said Robert Barbera, chief economist for ITG Investment Technology Group. 
 The Federal Reserve ended the mid-'70s and early '80s recessions by cutting interest rates sharply to encourage borrowing and spending in the private sector. This time, the credit crisis, rising unemployment, plunging home prices and bank failures have disrupted that mechanism, particularly since late summer. 
 Indeed, until the fourth quarter, the nation's output had declined only in the third quarter, falling by half a percent at an annual rate. The Fed, in response to the accelerating decline, cut rates to nearly zero -- a tactic that in the past would have raised cries of loose money and rising inflation.
 The concern now, however, is deflation, or falling prices, and Friday's report from the Bureau of Economic Analysis suggested that the fear had some justification. Personal consumption expenditures, not counting food and energy, rose at an annual rate of only 1.6 percent, the smallest quarterly increase in years. If prices were to actually fall, consumers might respond by putting off purchases until prices were even lower.
 ''My sense is that business is slashing hugely and across the board,'' said Allen Sinai, president and chief global economist of Decision Economics. ''Everyone is cutting prices, people, capital spending and all kinds of expenses. It is almost a herd instinct.''

HEADLINE: A Banker's Tips for a Potential Business Borrower

BYLINE: By J. ALEX TARQUINIO

 BODY:
BOB SEIWERT, the senior vice president for the Center for Commercial Lending and Business Banking at the American Bankers Association, a trade group in Washington, urges small-business owners to start meeting with bankers before they need a new loan or credit line. Mr. Seiwert spoke in a recent interview about the challenges facing small-business owners seeking business loans.
 Before joining the bankers' association, Mr. Seiwert worked for 30 years as a commercial banker -- more than half of that with the Banc One Corporation. Among other roles, he was the chairman and chief executive of one of Banc One's separately chartered community banks, based in Wooster, Ohio. Here are excerpts from an interview: 
 Q.What is your top piece of advice for small-business owners who are worried about their ability to continue financing their company in this credit environment?
 A. You may have a great relationship with your bank, but you should always have a backup relationship. That is really critical in today's environment. You should visit a number of financial institutions and get a feel for which ones are seeking business like yours. Many banks offer small-business loans, but they don't specialize in them. And some banks only specialize in small-business loans to certain industries. So ask the bankers if they would be open to extending credit to your business, and if so, under what terms. You may find that the loan window is open for you, and you may find that it's not.
 Q. How much weight do bankers give to a small-business owner's individual credit history -- or FICO score -- the credit score created by the Fair Isaac Corporation, which has so much influence over what consumers pay for credit cards and home loans?
 A. For very small loans -- $10,000 to $30,000, for example -- banks automate the process. Every bank has its own credit scoring model, but FICO scores are a part of that model. If you have a FICO score below 700, you're going to have a hard time getting a small-business loan. Standards have tightened recently, so I assure you the baseline is higher than 700 now. For small-business loans in excess of that, the banker is really trying to determine the character of the borrower. Checking the past payment history with the credit bureaus is a part of that. But it's more involved. What he is asking himself is, ''If your business gets into trouble, will you work with me to repay the loan? Or are you going to look for ways to get out of paying me?'' If you flunk the character test, it's all over.
 Q. Once a banker has extended a small-business loan, what are some of the red flags that he is watching for, especially in a recession like this when so many small businesses are hurting?
 A. As a banker, I always knew that if I didn't get the company's financial statements on time, it probably wasn't a good sign. People were always quick to give me good news. Make sure you share all the news with your banker: the good, the bad and the ugly. Bankers don't like surprises. That's not how you build trust. And don't kid yourself. That banker sees a lot of businesses in your line of work. He banks a lot of your competitors and reads the national statistics. You will get a lot of points with your banker if you demonstrate that you understand the risks of your business in this economy.
 Q. If a small-business owner has an open credit line with a bank that she has not tapped out, should she be worried that the bank might slice into the unused portion of her credit line?
 A. There are two types of credit line. If you have a contractual line of credit, the bank is obligated to maintain that. There is usually an upfront fee because, in essence, the bank is reserving those funds for you. But you may have gotten a letter from the bank giving you a guidance line of credit, and the bank is not obligated to maintain that. The key words to look for in a guidance letter are ''terms that are mutually agreeable to both parties,'' and ''subject to review from time to time.'' This is essentially a feel-good line of credit. If you got one of those letters a year or so ago, you should talk to your banker and ask him point blank if this money is there for you if you need it tomorrow. If you're not comfortable with your banker's answer, shop around.
 Q. Given the severity of the credit crisis, what are some of the forthright questions that borrowers should be asking about the financial health of their bank?
 A. Not all banks are equally affected by this credit crisis. Banks that rely mostly on local sources of funding -- like checking accounts, savings accounts and local C.D.'s -- are not as affected as banks that rely on what I call ''hot money.'' The other aspect of this is that if your bank lent to certain industries that have been hard hit, it may have to ratchet up its lending standards. Those banks that specialized in construction and development loans, for example, are really hurting today. But the important thing to understand is that there are 8,000 banks in this country, and most of them are well capitalized and open for business.

HEADLINE: Job Cuts Cause Boom In Lawsuits

BYLINE: By JONATHAN D. GLATER

 BODY:
First layoffs, then lawsuits. 
 More workers are being let go as corporate layoffs that began in earnest last year have accelerated in recent weeks. And more often, people are looking around and complaining that they have been unfairly or improperly dismissed.
 Former employees of Lehman Brothers, for example, say they were not given the required 60 days' pay before their jobs vanished, while Dell is being sued over allegations of age and sex discrimination against workers, in what lawyers say are growing choruses.
 Before filing many types of discrimination lawsuits, disgruntled employees must file a claim with the government. The number of such claims, which had fallen for several years, rose more than 15 percent last year on top of a smaller increase in 2007, and lawyers expect a bigger jump this year.
 People take legal action out of desperation as it becomes more difficult to find new employment, said Lawrence Z. Lorber, an employment lawyer at Proskauer Rose in Washington. 
 ''When there is no job, there is no safety valve,'' he said, ''so people who have issues and then lose their jobs or have some adverse employment action taken, are now much more willing to file their suits.''
 But a number of laws -- most of them passed in better times -- also give victims of layoffs more legal arguments to draw on since the last steep recession in the early 1980s. 
 The suddenly unemployed may be emboldened by a sense that the Obama administration will be more aggressive in enforcing employment laws. Under the Bush administration, the number of employment lawsuits brought by the government declined for several years.
 ''This is the first time we've had major reductions in force with the full panoply of employment protections we have now,'' said Joseph M. Sellers, head of the employment practice at the law firm Cohen Milstein Sellers & Toll. ''We are embarking on a new phase in employment litigation.''
 Though there are no statistics on total employment cases, lawyers say the number of suits is rising fast. But lawyers also say that winning an employment case is not easy. 
 Employees of several companies are trying to bring class-action suits -- which will require a judge's approval. Terminated employees of the furniture retailer Ethan Allen filed an age discrimination lawsuit against the company in October. Former employees of Dell, the computer maker, filed an age and sex discrimination suit against the company that same month. A veteran terminated by Lockheed Martin sued in November, claiming among other things that the company discriminated against veterans. 
 Individual claims, as opposed to class actions, are rising too, lawyers say. So are lawsuits on behalf of employees claiming they never received overtime pay.
 In a decision in 2007, the Supreme Court effectively blocked a sex discrimination claim against Goodyear Tire and Rubber by Lilly Ledbetter, who argued that for years she had been paid less than her male colleagues. The court ruled she had to bring the case within 180 days of her employer's initial decision to pay her less than men.
 President Obama signed legislation on Thursday overturning the Supreme Court's decision, which could open the doors to similar cases. Congress is weighing legislation to expand on laid-off workers' rights. 
 Some companies, retrenching quickly or collapsing, may have violated a 1989 law requiring 60 days' notice before laying off workers. It is the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act, known as the Warn Act, and a complaint by a group of displaced workers who did not get pay for that time led to a Chicago sit-in recently. Suits claiming Warn Act violations have been filed not only against Lehman Brothers, the failed investment bank, but also against Eos, a bankrupt airline, and a pair of law firms that recently folded, Thelen and Heller Ehrman. 
 At Eos, employees were paid twice a month and were told of the company's collapse days before payday, said Peter C. Mochnal, a former director of global sales for the airline and the class representative in the suit. He worked at Eos from 2005 until its bankruptcy last spring; the airline did not pay him during his last weeks at the company, nor did it pay him the amounts mandated by the Warn Act.
 ''My first paycheck from Air Partner came maybe two weeks into August,'' said Mr. Mochnal, referring to the aviation services company where he now works. He added that he had earned more than $10,000 a month at Eos, so two months' pay would have been substantial. 
 Mr. Mochnal said that he considered his family lucky. Though they had to make do with much less and relied on credit cards for a few months, they had just sold their house in Florham Park, N.J., before he lost his job. ''We had moved in with my in-laws'' in the same town, he said. ''That is the only thing that saved us.''
 With bankruptcy the only other bright spot for lawyers in this recession, some law firms are focusing on these types of cases.
 ''We have a Warn Act practice group that we started from scratch a year and a half ago, and they're busy, busy, busy,'' said Wayne N. Outten of Outten & Golden, a New York employment law firm representing the Eos employees. ''We have filed somewhere in the neighborhood of 25 Warn Act cases, two-thirds of those in the last four months.''
 Many corporate defendants may not have the funds to pay up even if they are found in violation. If the plaintiffs suing Lehman are successful, for example, they will end up as claimants in bankruptcy court, with probably a small fraction of the amount sought, alongside the company's other creditors. The Eos plaintiffs stand to receive about $1.7 million, just over half of what their lawyer says they were owed, under a settlement approved by federal bankruptcy court in White Plains on Wednesday. 
 The number of lawsuits filed under the Warn Act or state versions of it (under New York's law, which takes effect Feb. 1, companies must provide 90 days' notice before a layoff) could multiply quickly. Such suits do not require plaintiffs to wait until the government has a chance to investigate. 
 Courts and lawmakers have also given employees more options under longstanding antidiscrimination laws. In the fall, Congress modified laws prohibiting discrimination against the disabled, increasing the number of conditions considered disabling. 
 A critical ruling by the Supreme Court in 2005 augmented protections for older workers. The court stated that a plaintiff in such an discrimination lawsuit need not prove an employer acted intentionally, only that a layoff had a ''disparate impact'' on older workers. The ruling is important because it can be difficult to find evidence that an employer deliberately singled out one or a group of employees.
 Only recently have employment lawyers begun to take advantage of protections afforded by federal law to people caring for family members who are sick. Reductions in force, or RIFs, that affect people who are caregivers may violate one of several federal laws, including a prohibition on sex discrimination. 
 ''There is robust social science evidence that there is serious workplace discrimination against mothers and that in the context of this economic downturn it appears that mothers are encountering lots of what they see as 'mommy RIFs,' '' said Joan C. Williams, a professor at the University of California Hastings College of the Law and director of the Center for WorkLife Law. Ms. Williams added that calls had soared in recent months to a hotline for caregivers who thought discrimination played a role in their layoffs.
 Proving discrimination is not easy; much turns on the specific facts of an individual's case. And while the number of legal arguments available to plaintiffs may have increased, winning in court has actually become more difficult, according to several employment lawyers.
 ''Interpretations of these laws often make it harder for plaintiffs to prevail,'' Mr. Sellers said.
 In many instances, employers will offer severance payments only to employees who agree to sign away their right to sue. So recipients of generous severance packages, like people laid off by Wall Street firms, may sit out the litigation fray.

HEADLINE: Psst! Spend Your Regards To Broadway

BYLINE: By PATRICK HEALY; Compiled by DAVE ITZKOFF

 BODY:
Fearing that a recession-driven drop in New York City tourism will hurt Broadway ticket sales, theater industry leaders and city officials on Friday announced a new advertising campaign to urge people in the city and the tristate area to see more shows -- but stopped short of any broad move to drive down ticket prices. NYC & Company, the city's tourism and marketing arm, held a news conference to unveil new posters that read ''Ask New York City about New York City Broadway,'' which will appear on city street poles and bus shelters in February. It will also run an ad in taxis and add information about shows (above, a scene from ''Billy Elliot'') and discounts to its Web site, nycgo.com/Broadway. In private conversations, theater producers and press agents are increasingly contending that the economic fortunes of Broadway this spring -- and for the 2009-10 season -- will rely to a large extent on getting New Yorkers and suburban residents to go to the theater in greater than usual numbers, given the uncertainty about tourism.

HEADLINE: Successor in Illinois Is the Unassuming, Independent Anti-Blagojevich

BYLINE: By SUSAN SAULNY; Monica Davey contributed reporting.

DATELINE: CHICAGO 

 BODY:
Temperate, unfussy and, at times, so independent that he can be out of the loop, the 41st governor of Illinois could not be any more unlike the man he replaced -- the attention-loving showman, Rod R. Blagojevich, who was removed from office on Thursday. 
 And that has a lot of people in Illinois breathing a sigh of relief. 
 The new governor, Patrick J. Quinn, was once known as more gadfly than political heavyweight. He eased his way into state politics more than 30 years ago on the dry work of petition drives (one led to a reduction in the size of the Illinois General Assembly), getting ahead despite shallow pockets and a disdain for the Democratic Party machine.
 Mr. Quinn, 60, can be so unassuming that he watched the inauguration of President Obama in Washington crunched down on his knees so that people behind him could get a better view. When prone to boasting, which is not very often, it can be about miserly stuff, like staying in budget hotels and eating discount meals. 
 His idea of a political stunt is walking more than 150 miles from the Mississippi River to Lake Michigan to raise awareness of health care needs. And with a hairline more John Lithgow than Elvis, he does not even look the Blagojevich part. 
 ''What you see is what you get,'' said one of Mr. Quinn's longtime allies, State Representative John Fritchey, a Democrat. ''He is an apolitical creature in a political world.''
 As a team, Mr. Quinn, who was until Thursday the lieutenant governor, and Mr. Blagojevich were always more odd couple than twins, thrown together in their first race for statewide office in 2002 after winning separate Democratic primaries. Shortly after their re-elections in 2006, they stopped speaking altogether.
 Already, in his first hours as governor, Mr. Quinn was charting his own course: in a series of interviews and public appearances he promised an honest, transparent and accessible administration. He reached out to include in his decision-making some of the state's other elected officers who had long been shut out by Mr. Blagojevich. And he signed an executive order that made an official state entity out of a reform commission he established as lieutenant governor last month. 
 Unlike Mr. Blagojevich, who disdained the capital and lived in Chicago, Mr. Quinn, a divorced father of two adult sons, plans to move into the governor's mansion. That alone signals a whole new day.
 ''He's the anti-Blagojevich, for sure,'' said State Representative Jack D. Franks, a Democrat. 
 Mr. Blagojevich is, apparently, not a fan.
 ''He's going to raise taxes on people,'' the former governor said of Mr. Quinn on Thursday after being ousted from office. ''He's going to hurt people. And that's part of the deal here. Get me out of the way. He's going to raise the income tax on people by Memorial Day. And he'll probably allow a sales tax on gas, too.''
 But even Mr. Blagojevich vouched for Mr. Quinn's straight as an arrow reputation. Asked whether Mr. Quinn was corrupt, Mr. Blagojevich said simply, No.
 Still, this being Illinois, Mr. Quinn probably should not grow accustomed to such political generosity.
 His critics, particularly Republicans, have already pounced, angered that he changed his mind after initially supporting a special election to fill the United States Senate seat now occupied by Roland W. Burris, a Democrat whom Mr. Blagojevich appointed. 
 Detractors also claim that Mr. Quinn was not vocal enough in denouncing Mr. Blagojevich before his arrest in early December on federal corruption charges. 
 ''I think you can tell something about someone based on who they associate with,'' said State Representative Roger Eddy, a Republican. ''There was an opportunity to make a bolder statement two years ago. That's the part that really troubles me.''
 Although far from a political novice, Mr. Quinn is untested at meeting the kinds of challenges before him now: a crisis of confidence in government, a $4 billion budget gap, and a record level of unpaid bills to day care and health care providers and others.
 And he knows it: ''This is not a garden variety crisis,'' Mr. Quinn said in an interview. ''It will be a test for all of us, starting with me, to keep our eyes on the common good.'' 
 Even members of Mr. Quinn's party acknowledged that he has been something of an outsider over the years -- not someone who has a vast array of political allegiances and close allies. When the day is over, he likes to be alone, shooting hoops in the gym at a high school where one of his brothers is a basketball coach.
 At any other time, that isolation could cause a politician to falter, but in this moment, supporters say, there is a level of confidence in Mr. Quinn's ability to calm nerves, get to work and restore some humility to the governor's office.
 ''Historically, outsiders have not done well in our state,'' Mr. Franks said. ''But I think Pat Quinn is going to get a lot done. It's a much different climate now. This is a guy who brags about staying in Super 8s. Pat could care less about money.''
 It was money that is alleged to be at the root of Mr. Blagojevich's problems. Federal agents arrested him at his home on Dec. 9 on charges that, among other things, Mr. Blagojevich had schemed to sell the Senate seat vacated by Mr. Obama. 
 Since that morning, at 6:45, when Mr. Quinn said he got a call about the arrest, life has not been the same.
 ''It's a bit surreal, when you think about it,'' he said. 
 A White Sox fan who was born in Chicago, Mr. Quinn has a law degree from Northwestern University and, years ago, used to teach tax law and consumer economics at two local colleges. Growing up, his mother was an assistant at a middle school. His father was a personnel director for a group of cemeteries. 
 In 1980, one of Mr. Quinn's petition drives ended the practice that allowed Illinois legislators to collect their entire salaries on the first day in office. Along with his other petitions, like the one that reduced the size of the legislature, he was not earning a lot of friends in state government.
 One afternoon in 1976, he visited the Capitol and took a seat in the gallery.
 ''They said, 'Up there in the gallery is that Pat Quinn,' '' he remembered one lawmaker saying. ''And they stood up and booed for three minutes. One guy called it a standing boo-vation.''
 A few years later, he was elected commissioner of the Cook County Board of Tax Appeals, his first elected office. He has served in a number of other positions, usually gravitating to veterans affairs, environmental and consumer protection issues. He was elected state treasurer in the early 1990s.
 Mr. Quinn said he was not sure whether he would run in 2010, when Mr. Blagojevich's term ends. As it was, he had not decided what to do when his term as lieutenant governor was up.
 One thing he will not do, he said, is let his newfound popularity go to his head.
 ''You want to know my philosophy?'' Mr. Quinn said. ''One day a peacock. The next day a feather duster.''

HEADLINE: Its Frugality Offsetting Lower Oil Prices, Exxon Tops Its Own Profit Record

BYLINE: By JAD MOUAWAD and CLIFFORD KRAUSS

 BODY:
Despite collapsing oil prices in recent months, Exxon Mobil, the world's largest publicly traded oil company, still managed to set a record for last year as the most profitable American corporation ever.
 Exxon earned $45.2 billion in 2008, beating the record it set in 2007 for most profitable corporation, at $40.6 billion. That came despite a fourth quarter in which income fell 33 percent, owing to the steepest drop ever in oil prices, as the economy went into a tailspin.
 After riding a tide of swelling earnings in recent years, the once high-flying oil sector is scrambling to adjust to a sharp downturn. Oil consumption is falling in all major developed nations as economies shrink and consumers cut back on spending. 
 As a result, oil prices have dropped more than 70 percent since peaking above $145 a barrel in July. On Friday, they traded at about $42 a barrel.
 Because of its close attention to cost reduction and efficiency, Exxon is weathering the drop in oil prices better than most rivals. As most companies trim spending and scale back some operations, Exxon signaled it would stick with its strategy. 
 More than any other oil company, managers at Exxon emphasize a strict attention to containing costs, and are disciplined about their investments. As a result, the company manages to extract more dollars than its rivals out of each barrel that it pumps or refines. 
 The method has served the company well when times were good, and is likely to provide some shelter in a long downturn, analysts said.
 The company has more than $30 billion in cash that could provide it with a strategic war chest to make acquisitions, according to analysts. Many have forecast a wave of buyouts in the sector as companies struggle to finance their projects or even to survive.
 At a conference last month, Exxon's chairman and chief executive, Rex W. Tillerson, also signaled the company would increase its capital spending program by 20 percent this year. Exxon spent $26 billion in 2008 to increase production and develop new projects, 25 percent more than in 2007. It has outlined plans to spend an average of $25 billion a year through 2012.
 ''These results reflect the strength of our business model,'' David Rosenthal, Exxon's vice president for investor relations, said during a conference call. Despite falling prices, the company still earned $7.8 billion in the last quarter, down from $11.7 billion in the year-earlier period.
 Earlier this week both Royal Dutch Shell and ConocoPhillips reported large quarterly losses as asset values dropped because of the fall in oil prices. Chevron, the second-largest American oil company, said Friday that its net income rose 1 percent, to $4.9 billion, in the fourth quarter. For the year, Chevron's earnings rose 28 percent, to $24 billion.
 Shares of Exxon closed at $76.48, down 52 cents, on Friday, and Chevron fell 10 cents, to $70.52 a share.
 Exxon said that it gave back $40.1 billion to its shareholders in 2008, 12 percent more than in 2007, through either dividends or share buybacks. 
 On Friday, the company signaled that its share buyback program, which totaled $8 billion in the fourth quarter, would be trimmed slightly to $7 billion in the first quarter of 2009. 
 Exxon pumped about 2.47 million barrels of oil a day in the fourth quarter and produced 9.8 billion cubic feet of natural gas a day. Over all, oil and gas production decreased 3 percent in the fourth quarter, compared with the year-earlier period. (In some countries, Exxon is entitled to fewer barrels of oil when prices rise.)
 The company started eight major projects last year, including Thunder Horse, a huge offshore platform in the Gulf of Mexico.
 In recent months, projects have been canceled or deferred in Australia, Canada and Saudi Arabia. 
 In the United States, several oil and refinery companies in recent days have told investors that they intended to respond to the falling oil and natural gas prices by laying off workers, writing down asset values and reducing capital spending. With gasoline demand down, refineries have been particularly squeezed. 
 As a sign that the days of extraordinary profit growth are over, Baker Hughes, a Houston oil service company, announced that it would cut 1,500 of its 40,000 employees. Schlumberger, another service company, reported a nearly 17 percent drop in fourth-quarter earnings. The company said it would reduce its 19,000 North American employees by almost 5 percent. Refining margins have been so weak that Valero announced this week it would close its Texas City refinery while it underwent maintenance for the next six weeks. 
 As it has been many times in the past, Exxon was the exception to the sudden turn of fortune in the oil patch.
 ''Exxon kept its head when everyone else was going crazy going to alternatives and drilling more,'' said Phil Flynn, a vice president and oil analyst at Alaron Trading. ''But Exxon knew after every boom comes a bust, and focused on the future.''

HEADLINE: Peaceful Clinic Flooded With Patients With Their Own Fiscal Crises

BYLINE: By ANEMONA HARTOCOLLIS

DATELINE: WHITE PLAINS 

 BODY:
One woman whose husband had lost his job on Wall Street began to shrink from friends and neighbors in her Long Island suburb, mortified by what she perceived as her drop in social status.
 Another wealthy woman, worried about whether she would have enough money to buy groceries, refused to eat.
 A Manhattan real estate investor grew so paralyzed by financial fear that he asked his wife -- who had hardly paid a bill in her life -- to take over the family finances.
 They are among a stream of executives -- or ex-executives -- and their spouses who have kept the beds filled in a revolving wheel of 10-day stays at the Haven, an exclusive clinic on a pastoral Victorian-era campus here, with what might be called recession psychosis: symptoms, including severe anxiety and suicidal tendencies, set off by the economy. 
 While the condition is not in the official Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, it is familiar to therapists, those who run suicide hotlines and fancy facilities like the Haven, which added staff members this month as its average daily count rose to 14, up from 5 in August and 10 through the fall.
 For a few days in October, the staff at the Haven prohibited patients from watching financial news and suspended delivery of the Wall Street Journal, encouraging patients to talk about the weather or read junk novels instead. ''There's been a tremendous surge because of the economic climate and impact on certain high-profile individuals,'' said Dr. Nabil Kotbi, the psychiatrist who runs the Haven. ''On Wall Street, we've seen people doing more than they can possibly humanly do so that they are not part of the list being fired. When they come to us, they are so far gone they need acute psychiatric treatment.''
 Many of these new patients spent years enjoying not just an ordinary measure of prosperity but the often-outsize financial, emotional and social rewards that accompanied the boom.
 Dr. Kotbi said they often suffer ''delusions of poverty'' -- which is in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, associated with psychotic depression -- and despite retaining millions of dollars in assets, are crippled by self-doubt, loss of power, and sometimes guilt.
 Personality traits that once served them well, or were at least tolerated in their working environments -- megalomania, manic swings, obsession, hot tempers -- have turned into liabilities as they spend more time at home, Dr. Kotbi and other psychiatrists said. 
 The blow to the self-image of losing a job or forced retirement has often translated into symptoms like headaches, memory loss, fatigue and drug dependency. A Master of the Universe who becomes depressed feels like ''the worst person in the world,'' said Dr. Phillip Freeman, a psychoanalyst on the faculty of the Harvard Medical School. ''More significant than absolute loss of money is absolute loss of face. Humiliation and shame are probably more relevant.''
 On the lower rungs of the economic ladder, mental-health care often falls off in a bad economy, counted among the luxuries people can no longer afford.
 But cries for help have increased. The National Suicide Prevention Lifeline reported a 30 percent jump in calls over the last year, to 545,851 from 402,167, and Richard McKeon, a psychologist and federal public health expert, said that crisis centers were reporting ''a significant increase in the number of people who are giving economic reasons'' for calling, whether it is ''the loss of a job, loss of a home, or fear of that.''
 At McLean Hospital in Belmont, Mass., where James Taylor famously spent a stint as a teenager, admissions were up 30 percent to 513 in December from 393 in December 2007, said Dr. Joseph Gold, the chief medical officer. 
 At the Menninger Clinic, in Houston, which runs a program for ''professionals in crisis,'' the director, Dr. Michael Groat, recalled a patient who checked in recently because of his overwhelming guilt at having laid people off.
 And Dr. Paula Eagle, an associate professor at Columbia University, said that investment bankers in her private therapy practice, suffering from paranoia, have described mordant-humor fantasies circulating among their colleagues that the collapse of the financial markets would lead to New York City going broke and martial law being declared. 
 ''They were going to buy guns and rafts and float down the Hudson River,'' Dr. Eagle said. ''It stirred up a lot of 9/11 kinds of feelings -- this is disaster time and we have to be prepared to run for cover.''
 It is impossible, of course, to determine precisely the number of former financial titans suffering from recession psychosis. A spokeswoman for one investment house, Barclays Capital, which bought the United States business of the bankrupt Lehman Brothers, said the human resources department could not provide data about employees' mental health treatment and declined to let a former Lehman executive discuss the subject. The executive did not return a call..
 But the Haven, part of NewYork-Presbyterian/Westchester hospital, is in a unique position to see such cases, because it was founded six years ago with the promise that wealthy people with name recognition could go there and be in a protective cocoon. 
 Administrators of the clinic said they try to combine that promise of discretion with a professional immunity to the allure of wealth and power, staying attuned, for example, to the risk that patients accustomed to running big companies will try to run their own treatment as well.
 Haven patients get fluffy towels and bathrobes, and courtesy shampoo, but are barred from having BlackBerrys or cellphones. They can use their laptops if a psychiatrist approves. Other than the locked doors, it is a hotel-like setting; the grounds include a small, par-3 golf course, though playing is contingent on a doctor's approval.
 Most patients declined to be interviewed, even anonymously, but the doctors shared their stories -- while preserving patient confidentiality -- to illuminate the nuances of what they see as a growing mental-health concern.
 Dr. Stephen Ferrando, NewYork-Presbyterian/Westchester's acting associate medical director, said that the status-conscious Long Island woman was a prime example of how it is often ''not necessarily about the money; in our business, it's about destabilization, disequilibrium.'' 
 The case was also interesting because she seemed to absorb more of the psychic injury than her laid-off husband, who, Dr. Kotbi noted, got a golden parachute that would replace his income for the next 20 years, and now ''had more time for golf.'' 
 But the wife complained that ''instead of just being busy, he became detached,'' Dr. Kotbi said. ''When he was working, they had quality time; now they had quantity time.''
 She was fixated, he said, on ''how the community was thinking about her and her kids.''
 Treating high-profile patients can intensify the risk of what psychiatrists call countertransference -- in this case, perhaps, blaming the patient for one's own financial woes.
 ''I've lost money in my 401(k), I've got to punish them,'' Dr. Kotbi imagined a therapist thinking, if only subconsciously. ''Sometimes I think that could interfere with treatment.''
 Alongside depression and anxiety over job losses, psychiatrists at the Haven said they have also seen still-employed executives suffering from manic episodes as they struggle to prove themselves worthy of keeping their jobs amid major layoffs. 
 Some drink more to curb stress, use illegal drugs like cocaine to help them meet deadlines, or take sedatives like benzodiazepines to calm them so they can attend meetings ''without having sweaty palms.''
 ''They are so fearful of losing their jobs that they want to do three, four times the things they should do,'' Dr. Kotbi said. 
 He had one patient who was on the phone from 2 to 4 a.m. daily, ''because he had to follow the markets all over the world. That can drive anyone crazy.''
 Some patients are paralyzed by guilt. ''They can't say they lost X, Y and Z, because everybody else lost more,'' Dr. Kotbi said. ''One patient told me, 'I feel silly. I lost a few houses, when people who were in Katrina have nowhere to go.'''
 One of the few Haven patients willing to be interviewed, on the condition that he not be named, had been a Manhattan real estate investor who bought tenements and a townhouse in the East Village in the 1970s, when owners were all but giving them away.
 In 2007, as the subprime mortgage mess was taking hold, the investor, having sold the tenements, was trying to sell the townhouse, where he had raised his children, and move to Connecticut with his second wife.
 Two $4 million contracts fell through. He was highly leveraged, having already bought the house in Connecticut, and found himself borrowing against his children's trust funds. As his sense of foreboding grew, the investor said, he stopped eating and sleeping, waking one day at 3 a.m. begging his wife, an artist with little financial savvy, to pay the bills for him. 
 He said his fears expanded to include one that Pakistan would annihilate the world with a nuclear bomb. His signature became unrecognizable. As he neared his 70th birthday, his doctor at first diagnosed dementia.
 ''I've been through recessions before,'' said the investor, dressed in a dignified black turtleneck and herringbone jacket. ''But this was nuts.''
 Determined to have generalized anxiety and major depressive disorder, with psychotic features, the investor had two 10-day stays at the Haven, and was gradually downgraded to therapy sessions every other month from every week.
 Part of his recovery could have been financial. The townhouse was sold last year, for $3.7 million.

HEADLINE: The Smell Of Success In the Quarter May Change

BYLINE: By ADAM NOSSITER

DATELINE: NEW ORLEANS 

 BODY:
The smell of the French Quarter has long been a combination of the historical and the unspeakable, a toxic and unwelcome reminder of last night's visitors. 
 That immemorial stench has been mostly a bad memory for the last two years, though, thanks to Sidney D. Torres IV, a stylish garbageman whose vigorous sweeping and spraying broke the unloved tradition, astonishing citizens here. The Quarter was clean, flushed with a patented compound; Mr. Torres, 33, was a local hero, hounded for autographs. 
 But now another unhappy tradition -- New Orleans politics -- is poised to undo his efforts, and on the eve of Mardi Gras. The stink that was an undignified counterpoint to the old townhouses threatens a return, just as Carnival's all-out assault begins. 
 Mayor C. Ray Nagin, feuding with the City Council and claiming budget woes, says he wants to cut the street flushing, mechanical brushing and constant litter patrols that have made the Quarter nearly unrecognizable, but in a good way, to longtime residents and visitors. 
 The mayor's threat has touched a nerve in a place where so much, coming from City Hall, seems to have gone so wrong since Hurricane Katrina. Here was a welcome exception, and it could be ending. Residents and bartenders from one end of the Quarter to the other are decrying it, and the newly combative Council has threatened to take Mr. Nagin to court to block his efforts. 
 Why step on the city's principal income source, his critics say, a place that receives nearly seven million visitors a year and indirectly contributes about 30 percent of its operating budget, all for a relatively modest savings of $2.5 million in a budget of nearly $500 million? As of late Friday there was little budging, though the Council president, Jackie Clarkson, said she thought a compromise would eventually be reached. 
 If not, the soapy suds shooting down Bourbon Street from Mr. Torres's custom-built flusher truck could soon be replaced by more unwholesome ones. ''This is crazy, man -- as of midnight tomorrow it will be a big mess,'' said Mr. Torres, general of the Quarter's omnipresent black-clad army of cleaners, known officially as SDT Waste and Debris Services. ''Your vomit's very common on Bourbon Street,'' said Mr. Torres, speaking as one who knows. 
 He looked down a newly scrubbed section of Toulouse Street, its granite edging gleaming. ''In the morning it's full,'' he said, employing colorful terms for bodily wastes.
 The Quarter denizens know this, and they are angry at the mayor, grateful to Mr. Torres. ''Thank you, Mr. Torres,'' a man shouts from a passing pickup truck. 
 ''We think it's a bad decision, and the timing's really bad too,'' said Marita Jaeger, a bartender at Johnny White's. The scrubbing ''has done a lot for the Quarter,'' she said. ''The smell was horrible. I think the mayor's not thinking things through. He's out of touch.''
 Others used more descriptive language, and several said the newly clean Quarter had been important in reviving the tourism economy here. ''People have started to come back in,'' said Earl Bernhardt, a nightclub and restaurant owner. ''They quit coming because it was dirty and it smelled bad. The Quarter smelled like somebody threw up, like a Jolly Green Giant threw up on Bourbon Street. With this sanitizing and deodorizing, we don't have that anymore.'' 
 A spokeswoman for Mr. Nagin affirmed that he, too, was seeking a compromise. ''Mayor Nagin is the person who created this, so this is a very difficult decision,'' said Ceeon Quiett, the spokeswoman, referring to his earlier advocacy of the cleaning regimen. ''There are cuts all over our city, as well as in our state,'' she added, pointing out that the mayor and the Council are trying to find another revenue source.
 She said the Quarter would continue to be cleaned in other ways, whatever the outcome of the dispute. 
 A background of constant feuding between mayor and Council preceded Mr. Nagin's decision. He was angry when the Council rejected his proposal for a property tax increase in December; before that, Mr. Nagin, who is black, accused a white councilwoman of using racially charged language when she questioned other garbage contracts in the city, though a tape of the episode failed to bear out the accusations. Indeed, relations between the mayor and Council have been particularly tense since the body became mostly white, for the first time in years, after Hurricane Katrina. 
 Mr. Torres's scrub-trucks, with their giant bottom-brushes reaching deep into the gutters of the Quarter's hard-pressed streets, are considered irreplaceable by those whose lives have improved since their arrival. 
 ''It's ridiculous,'' said Benji Palus, manager and bartender at the Three Legged Dog on Burgundy Street. ''He gave us one thing that we clapped him on the back for, and now he's taking it away from us.'' 
 The Quarter, he said, had shown great improvement, now threatened. ''It even seems like there's fewer rats,'' said Mr. Palus, adding, ''You smell the food, and not the garbage.''

HEADLINE: American Express Kept a (Very) Watchful Eye on Charges

BYLINE: By RON LIEBER. 
What reason has your card company given for changing your credit terms? Write to rlieber@nytimes.com

 BODY:
You probably know that credit card companies have been scrutinizing every charge on your account in recent years, searching for purchases that thieves may have made. Turns out, though, that some of the companies have been suspicious of your own spending, too.
 In recent months, American Express has gone far beyond simply checking your credit score and making sure you pay on time. The company has been looking at home prices in your area, the type of mortgage lender you're using and whether small-business card customers work in an industry under siege. It has also been looking at how you spend your money, searching for patterns or similarities to other customers who have trouble paying their bills. 
 In some instances, if it didn't like what it was seeing, the company has cut customer credit lines. It laid out this logic in letters that infuriated many of the cardholders who received them. ''Other customers who have used their card at establishments where you recently shopped,'' one of those letters said, ''have a poor repayment history with American Express.'' 
 It sure sounded as if American Express had developed a blacklist of merchants patronized by troubled cardholders. But late this week, American Express told me that wasn't the case. The company said it had also decided to stop using what it has called ''spending patterns'' as a criteria in its credit line reductions. 
 ''The letters were wrong to imply we were looking at specific merchants,'' said Susan Korchak, a company spokeswoman. The company uses hundreds of data points in making its decisions, she said, adding that the main factor in determining credit lines ''has always been and still is the overall level of debt, relative to the card member's financial resources.''
 The company will still have plenty of other data to judge your creditworthiness, though. American Express executives have spoken candidly to investors and analysts about its deep dives into your data. 
 A spokesman for Citigroup says that it is using some mortgage data to help it make credit decisions, but it is not using specific store data or looking at types of merchandise purchased. A spokeswoman for Capitol One said that geography was one of many factors it considered and that it, too, did not make decisions based on where people shop. 
 Bank of America and Chase declined to comment on precisely how their underwriting works, though it's safe to assume that they and other companies are looking at more data more carefully than they ever have before. 
 In the grave new world of the ever-worsening economy, lenders of all sorts are grasping for any sort of information that may shield them from ruin. In recent investor presentations, American Express executives have noted how much better the company's data-mining capabilities are than they were during the last two downturns. 
 As technological advances give banks better tools and exponentially more information on who their customers are and what they do all day, they no longer have to wait long to tweak their formulas. ''We have clients changing risk policies daily, depending on what they see in the marketplace,'' said Dennis Dixon, the president of Zoot, a technology company in Four Corners, Mont., that helps banks and others make credit decisions.
 The question, then, is how much of the data they can use before spooking their customers. Kevin D. Johnson, a 29-year-old Atlanta resident who runs a marketing and communications firm, received a letter from American Express last October saying that his credit limit was being lowered. One reason was that other customers who had used their cards at places where he had shopped were late in paying their bills. 
 The company couldn't -- or wouldn't -- tell him which charges had met with its disapproval. Frustrated, he told his story to the local newspaper and on ''Good Morning America.'' He also began documenting his experience on newcreditrules.com, where he posted the names of all the merchants he patronized, in the hope that other American Express customers would cross-check his list with theirs and solve the mystery. 
 When I queried the company this week, before it changed its policy, I noted that if it wouldn't tell people which establishments were suspect, people would have no choice but to guess. The truly paranoid, presumably, would stop using American Express cards altogether. 
 But American Express couldn't possibly go public with such a list. If it did, the merchants on the list, who generally pay the company a lot of money to accept its cards, would have a fit and hurl their Amex terminals into the nearest body of water. 
 Now, the company says that there never was such a list. So what about the language in its letters to cardholders, which calls out particular ''establishments'' where cardholders had shopped, I asked. Well, apparently that was all just a big misunderstanding, despite the number of people who must have been in on drafting the notes in the first place.
 American Express wouldn't have been the first company to try cordoning off certain industries. Last year, CompuCredit, a subprime lender, got in trouble with the Federal Trade Commission for failing to disclose that it could reduce customers' credit lines for using their cards at various establishments. 
 What was on CompuCredit's no-go list? Marriage counselors, tire retreading and repair shops, bars and nightclubs, pool halls, pawnshops and massage parlors, among others. 
 Robert Manning, a longtime critic of the industry and the author of ''Credit Card Nation,'' also pointed out that American Express ran the risk of discouraging a lot of virtuous behavior. ''If someone shops at the Dollar Store, he's a prudent steward of his financial resources, but the blunt instruments at Amex suggest that he's changing his financial behavior,'' he said. ''There's this ecological fallacy that if I suddenly make a charge at Wal-Mart, my line of credit would get bumped down.''
 But while American Express has pulled back from snooping on your shopping, it's still paying attention to other ways you spend. In one presentation to analysts, it noted that people with multiple residences and multiple mortgages used to be a good bet. Now, the reverse is true. 
 The company is also using credit reports to identify your mortgage lender. If it's a subprime lender or one that has gone bankrupt, that could affect the size of your credit line. Borrowers do not necessarily have a say in determining who ends up owning or servicing their mortgage, though. Ms. Korchak, the American Express spokeswoman, said that customers should call the company if they think there is any confusion about the identity of their original lender. 
 American Express has also been looking at the health of the industries where its small-business cardholders work. If you're a dentist, say, you may have less trouble with the card company than if you work in construction or finance. Al Kelly, the company's president, said in a presentation in August that it had made changes in credit limits ''by looking at industries that are facing, or might face, incremental stress.'' The ''might face'' could encompass all sorts of industries of the company's choosing. 
 So if you want to keep your credit unchanged, it now makes sense to actively manage your credit portfolio and look at it even more frequently than you do your investments. 
 If a card company lowers your credit limit, for instance, it can hurt your credit score, since one factor in your creditworthiness is how much of your available credit you're using at any given time. You want that percentage to be as low as possible, so you may have to pay down debt or use your cards less. 
 That said, if you have a high credit limit, that may make you a target, too. American Express has said it is keeping a particularly close eye on those customers. 
 If it feels as if you simply can't win here, remember that you do have choices. You can avoid credit cards in most instances. Or you can join a credit union or look to smaller banks, where better deals may be available. 
 Card companies presume that you'll suck it up and pay more or adjust your spending if they change their terms on you. But because they deploy such different tactics, you have the opportunity to leave one company and patronize another.

HEADLINE: Goodell Disputes Union's Profit Claims

BYLINE: By JUDY BATTISTA

DATELINE: TAMPA, Fla. 

 BODY:
N.F.L. Commissioner Roger Goodell said he was optimistic that owners and players would be able to forge a new labor agreement to avert a work stoppage after the 2010 season. But in his annual state of the league address on Friday, which centered heavily on how the financial crisis had affected the N.F.L., he also disputed as ''fiction'' a players union contention that teams averaged nearly $25 million in profit last year, even as the economy began its slide. Owners opted out of the collective bargaining agreement last spring.
 ''There's a lot of fiction in that report,'' Goodell said. ''The $24 million in profits is completely inaccurate. We understand our numbers. Ownership has spent a lot of time evaluating the current C.B.A. and determined it is better to terminate that agreement and come up with a new one that will be beneficial to the clubs and players. The economy turning sour has accentuated the importance of the C.B.A. I believe the N.F.L. can become an extremely valuable escape at a time like this.'' 
 In a concession to the tough times, Goodell said that three-quarters of the 32 teams would not raise season ticket prices next season. But he said the N.F.L. would not alter its blackout policy, which holds that games must be sold out to be broadcast in their local television markets. 
 Blackouts have been of increasing concern as the economy turned, particularly in hard-hit markets like Detroit, where several home games were blacked out in 2008. 
 Goodell added that Detroit would host a Thanksgiving game in 2009, although he said owners could discuss moving the game elsewhere, which would be viewed as a blow to a long-suffering fan base.
 Goodell also opened the door to revising the league's overtime rules. Historically, he said, the team that won the coin flip scored on its first possession 30 percent of the time. But that number has risen to 47 percent, a concern because of the increased accuracy of field-goal kickers. 
 Goodell said the owners would look at whether the kickoff should be moved so that drives would start deeper in the receiving team's territory, or whether the ball should be placed at a certain point to start the drive. 
 But he defended having a sudden-death overtime instead of giving each team at least one possession.
 ''We disagree very strongly that the game is determined by a coin flip,'' Goodell said. ''The point of the game is to win in regulation. You still have to get into scoring position. You have to earn your way to get that opportunity. We think the rule we have is a terrific rule.''
 Addressing other issues, Goodell said the competition committee would again consider rules to enhance player safety, particularly whether hits to the head with the shoulder should be prohibited. 
 The league strictly enforced illegal hits earlier this season -- players were fined and suspended for committing them -- and Goodell said it led to a notable decrease in the hits in the second half of the season.
 He also said the N.F.L. encouraged the Oakland Raiders and the San Francisco 49ers -- and their hometowns -- to explore the possibility of building a stadium the teams could share. ''A facility is badly needed in the Bay Area,'' Goodell said.

HEADLINE: Florida House Speaker Gives Up Duties; Cites Investigation

BYLINE: By GARY FINEOUT

DATELINE: TALLAHASSEE, Fla. 

 BODY:
The embattled speaker of the Florida House stepped down from that post on Friday, saying he could not carry out his duties while he was under investigation in a corruption inquiry. 
 The speaker, Ray Sansom, 46, a Republican from Destin, said in a memorandum to House members that he would temporarily hand over the responsibilities as speaker to Speaker Pro Tempore Larry Cretul, a Republican from Ocala, while he dealt with the legal proceedings against him. 
 Mr. Sansom's move follows the resignation on Tuesday of the speaker of the Massachusetts House, Salvatore F. DiMasi, a Democrat, who said he wanted to find a job outside politics. Mr. DiMasi's former campaign treasurer and accountant was indicted last month on charges of making illegal campaign contributions and illegal lobbying.
 On the same day in November that he was sworn in as speaker, Mr. Sansom took a $110,000-a-year part-time job as vice president for development and planning with Northwest Florida State College. 
 On Monday, a Leon County grand jury voted to investigate Mr. Sansom's ties to the college.
 The vote followed a series of articles in The St. Petersburg Times that detailed how Mr. Sansom had steered millions of dollars to the college while he was chairman of the House budget committee and raised questions about whether college officials had sidestepped Florida's open-government laws.
 Mr. Sansom resigned from the college job this month. He insisted Friday that he expected to be exonerated on all charges.
 ''The allegations and reports associated with these proceedings have caused my family grave pain, and this has prompted my decision,'' Mr. Sansom said of his stepping down. ''I expect positive outcomes and am confident that when the facts are known, my honesty and integrity will be confirmed.''
 He had come under increasing pressure from fellow Republicans worried about how the investigations would affect the Legislature when the state was facing a financial crisis. Lawmakers may have to cut billions more in state spending during the regular session that starts in March.
 ''I respect Speaker Sansom's difficult decision today,'' Gov. Charlie Crist, a Republican, said in a brief statement. 
 Mr. Sansom's move to relinquish his duties temporarily is believed to be a first in state history. Jill Chamberlin, a spokeswoman for Mr. Sansom, said that he would not give up his title, although Ms. Chamberlin could not say whether he would retain the $41,000 salary that goes with the post. Rank-and-file members of the House are paid $31,000.
 But Representative J. C. Planas, Republican of Miami, questioned the legality of the move and said the prospect of Mr. Sansom's return would not satisfy people upset with the Legislature. Other Republicans said they were comfortable with Mr. Sansom's temporary departure.
 Mr. Sansom was first elected to the Legislature in 2002. Thanks in part to term limits that force lawmakers out in eight years, he rose quickly in the ranks.
 His work to help his hometown college did not come under scrutiny until the college's Board of Trustees gave him the part-time job in November. 
 News reports detailed how Mr. Sansom championed legislation that elevated the college from its community college status and how he was able to win millions of dollars for construction projects for the college.

HEADLINE: Investors Gloomy as January Disappoints

BYLINE: By JACK HEALY

 BODY:
If January truly is a bellwether month for Wall Street, investors are in for another rocky year.
 Stock indexes finished out their worst January ever with a broad slide on Friday. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index was down 2.28 percent for the day and 8.57 percent lower for the month as signs of distress piled up in the economy. 
 Investors, who began the year hoping the worst had passed, ended the month more concerned than ever about how the nation would pull itself out of a 13-month recession. 
 ''Investors are just kind of paralyzed right now,'' said Randy Frederick, director of derivatives at Charles Schwab. ''I think investors have no clue what to do, and they're just sitting there waiting. It's virtually impossible to have any idea where this market is heading on a daily basis.''
 On Friday, it was down across all sectors, led by the consumer sector and companies that make basic materials like steel, chemicals, plastics and mining products.
 Shares of Procter & Gamble, the consumer products maker, fell 6.4 percent, to $54.50, after it cut its earnings outlook for 2009. 
 The Dow Jones industrial average fell 148.15 points, or 1.82 percent, to 8,000.86, and the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index dropped 19.26 points, or 2.28 percent, to 825.88. The Nasdaq composite index declined 31.42 points, or 2.08 percent, to 1,476.42.
 For the year, the Dow Jones industrial average is down 8.84 percent, while the Nasdaq composite is lower by 6.38 percent.
 The steep losses on Thursday and Friday peeled back gains from the previous three days, sending the major indexes moderately lower for the week. 
 ''We've wiped out a lot of the positive sentiment we'd built up in the first part of this week,'' said Tim Smalls, head of United States stock trading at Execution.
 The price of the April gold contract rose $21.90, to $928.40 an ounce, in New York, a sign that investors were growing increasingly anxious about the economy and about governmental plans to raise huge amounts of new debt. 
 ''The banking sector may not do well going forward, and the worse the banking sector does, the better gold does,'' said Bart Melek, global commodity strategist at BMO Capital Markets. ''It's been on fire.''
 Interest rates were steady. The Treasury's benchmark 10-year note rose 3/32, to 107 21/32. The yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, was at 2.85 percent, down from 2.86 percent late Thursday.
 The government underscored the darkening mood on Wall Street on Friday when it reported that the economy contracted at an annual rate of 3.8 percent from October through December. Consumer spending fell by 3.5 percent, and businesses tried to control their costs by slashing their investment in trucks, computers, office equipment and real estate.
 Although economists had been bracing for a drop of 5.5 percent, they said that the fourth-quarter declines would have been much steeper but for rising inventories of goods. The final sales figure, which excludes inventories, fell at a rate of 5.1 percent.
 ''The greatest drag on the economy is consumer spending, which has completely shut down,'' Bernard Baumohl, chief global economist at the Economic Outlook Group, wrote in a note. ''Worries over job security, rising debt burdens and the catastrophic loss of household wealth from plummeting home and stock values have so unnerved consumers that they are in lockdown mode.''
 Next Friday the government will release its January unemployment figures, a much-awaited announcement. Unemployment has risen to 7.2 percent since the recession began in December 2007, and investors fear the jobs picture is deteriorating more rapidly than expected.
 ''Those numbers are going to be one of the most important economic pieces of data we've seen in some time,'' said Ryan Detrick, an analyst at Schaeffer's Investment Research. 
 Market watchers have long sworn by the ''January effect,'' saying that the market's performance in the first month of the year often predicts how it will fare generally. So Wall Street's performance this month provided little cause for optimism.
 ''This market will not mount any meaningful bounce until we see resolution from housing and financials, and we have not seen that yet,'' Mr. Detrick said. ''The overall downward trend, unfortunately, is going to continue.''

HEADLINE: Russia and Cuba Take Steps to Revive a Bond

BYLINE: By MICHAEL SCHWIRTZ

DATELINE: MOSCOW 

 BODY:
The presidents of Russia and Cuba signed a strategic partnership and several other documents on Friday aimed at rekindling an alliance that collapsed after the cold war. They pledged to expand cooperation in agriculture, manufacturing, science and tourism, but studiously avoided a public discussion of military ties. 
 It had been nearly a quarter century since a Cuban leader had set foot on Russian soil. President Raul Castro's visit to Moscow this week had little of the pomp and propaganda of the cold war days, when he and his brother Fidel were greeted with parades in Red Square and Soviet leaders affectionately referred to Cuba as the ''island of freedom.'' 
 But almost two decades after a crumbling Soviet Union hastily withdrew financial and ideological backing from Cuba, Russia is seeking to expand economic ties with the island and possibly forge stronger military relations in an echo, as yet still faint, of an alliance that lasted some 30 years.
 It is part of a larger Russian push into Latin America to secure new markets, and also to swipe at the United States for what Moscow considers Washington's meddling in Russia's historic sphere of influence, particularly in Ukraine and Georgia, former Soviet republics. 
 ''Your visit opens a new page in the history of Russian-Cuban relations,'' President Dmitri A. Medvedev said at a meeting with Mr. Castro at the Kremlin on Friday. 
 Russian officials promised the delivery of 25,000 tons of grain and a $20 million loan for the development of Cuba's construction, energy and agriculture sectors. 
 ''Without a doubt,'' Mr. Castro said at the meeting, ''this is a historical moment, an important milestone in the relations between Russia and Cuba. We have taken a huge step to strengthen our relationship.''
 High-ranking Russian officials have visited Cuba several times in the past year, and Mr. Medvedev made a quick trip there in November as part of a Latin American tour. Trade between the countries increased 26 percent in 2008, totaling about $239 million, the Kremlin said. 
 ''In the last few years, relations with the United States have become strained, with the United States supporting Ukraine and Georgia in their anti-Russian policies,'' said Igor S. Fesunenko, a Russian journalist and longtime commentator on Latin American affairs. ''And we're thinking, 'Oh, how unfortunate that we abandoned Cuba sitting there under America's nose.' ''
 Like Venezuela, which last fall hosted two Russian strategic bombers capable of carrying nuclear weapons, Cuba has also had Russian military visitors recently. In December, a contingent of Russia's North Sea Fleet docked in Havana after conducting exercises with Venezuela's navy.
 Neither Mr. Medvedev nor Mr. Castro spoke publicly about possible military cooperation, perhaps out of a desire to avoid antagonizing the new administration of President Obama, analysts said. 
 Since Mr. Obama's election in November, Russia and Cuba appear to have called a unilateral truce with Washington, and the volume of anti-American sentiment, which reached a deafening pitch in Russia in recent years, has been markedly toned down. 
 ''Regardless of whether the policies of Washington will soften or remain significantly hard-line, relations between Cuba and Russia will develop,'' said Vladimir M. Davydov, director of the Latin American Institute at the Russian Academy of Sciences. 
 Nevertheless, the effects of the global economic crisis have forced Russia to scale back its plans in Latin America, Mr. Davydov and other analysts said.
 Cuba has also reacted cautiously to Russia's overtures because of lingering animosities that emerged when Moscow all but abandoned the country in the 1990s, leaving it impoverished and isolated. 
 Yet, while Mr. Castro's visit clearly does not carry the ideological weight evident at the height of Russia's cold war relationship with Cuba, vestiges of those bygone days remain. 
 In honor of Mr. Castro's visit, federal television channels showed documentaries about Cuba and the Castro brothers. In Moscow, the Central Museum of the Great Patriotic War, what Russians call World War II, opened an exhibition covering the history of the Cuban revolution. And Mr. Medvedev congratulated the Cuban people on the revolution's 50th anniversary.
 At an informal gathering at Mr. Medvedev's country home on Thursday, Mr. Castro waxed nostalgic, recounting the time he and Soviet comrades sat around a campfire in the forest eating salo, the cured pig fat that is a staple chaser of Russian vodka.
 ''I've desired this for 25 years,'' he said through a Russian translator. ''I don't know if I'll get to eat any salo with black bread, but I'm here.'' 
 A few hours later, Mr. Medvedev invited Mr. Castro to join him by a campfire in the forest around the presidential residence, and the two dined on the Russian delicacy. 

CORRECTION-DATE: February 6, 2009

 CORRECTION:
An article on Saturday about the signing of a strategic partnership by the presidents of Russia and Cuba, part of an effort to rekindle their countries' cold war alliance, referred incorrectly to Russians' use of the term ''Great Patriotic War.'' That is their description of the Soviet Union's struggle with Germany from 1941 to 1945, for Russians the overwhelmingly significant part of World War II; it is not the Russian name for the whole war.

HEADLINE: The Next Step on Warming

 BODY:
It seemed that every chance he got, President Bush ignored or flat out refused to address the problem of climate change. So we were greatly encouraged by President Obama's swift announcement that he is likely to approve California's request to regulate greenhouse gases from vehicles -- a request the Bush administration denied. 
 The logical next step would be for Mr. Obama to quickly address the Supreme Court's 2007 decision ordering the Environmental Protection Agency to examine the effects of greenhouse gases and to regulate them if necessary. Mr. Bush dodged that one, too. 
 The court instructed the agency to first determine whether global warming pollution threatened public health and welfare -- known as an ''endangerment finding'' under the Clean Air Act -- and, if so, to devise emissions standards for vehicles. 
 Lisa Jackson, the agency's new administrator, said in a memo to her employees last week that she intended to honor her ''obligation to address climate change under the Clean Air Act.'' But there is resistance from some members of Congress and parts of the business community who fear that regulating vehicle emissions of greenhouse gases will lead to economy-wide controls on greenhouse gases from all sources, including industry.
 Stephen Johnson, Mr. Bush's E.P.A. administrator, initially tried to do the right thing. He ordered his staff to write an endangerment finding and craft regulations limiting greenhouse gas emissions from vehicles. In December 2007, he sent the entire package to the White House, which not only chose to ignore the findings but refused to open the e-mail message that contained them. 
 Mr. Johnson then ordered up a laborious public rule-making process that essentially went nowhere and allowed Mr. Bush to retire to Texas without having done much of anything. Ms. Jackson is eager to get the process back on track. 
 Nobody, including the administrator, is under any illusions that the E.P.A. alone can solve climate change. Congress will have to take ownership of the issue by authorizing major public investments in clean-energy technologies and by putting a price on greenhouse-gas emissions in order to unlock private investment. 
 But smart regulation can begin to advance the ball. For starters, it would force industry to look for ways to make cars that are much more fuel-efficient. It would help goad Congress into action. It is also, as the Supreme Court has pointed out, the law.

HEADLINE: A Chaotic Kenya Vote and a Secret U.S. Exit Poll

BYLINE: By MIKE McINTIRE and JEFFREY GETTLEMAN

 BODY:
For three days in December 2007, Kenya slid into chaos as ballot counters steadily took what appeared to be a presidential election victory for the challenger and delivered it to the incumbent.
 As tensions mounted, Kenneth Flottman sat in Nairobi and grew increasingly frustrated. He had in his hands the results of an exit poll, paid for by the United States government, that supported the initial returns favoring the challenger, Raila Odinga. 
 Mr. Flottman, East Africa director for the International Republican Institute, the pro-democracy group that administered the poll, said he had believed that the results would promptly be made public, as a check against election fraud by either side. But then his supervisors said the poll numbers would be kept secret.
 When the incumbent, Mwai Kibaki, was finally declared the winner amid cries of foul, Kenya exploded in violence that would leave more than 1,000 people dead before the two sides negotiated a power-sharing deal two months later. With rioters roaming the streets, Mr. Flottman sent an e-mail message to a colleague saying he was worried that, in rebuffing his pleas to release the poll, the institute had succumbed to political pressure from American officials. 
 ''Supporting democracy and managing political outcomes are two different objectives for a nonpartisan, foreign-based organization or country,'' he wrote, ''and sometimes there is a conflict that requires a choice.''
 A year later, the poll's fate remains a source of bitter contention, even as Kenya has moved to remake its electoral system. The failure to disclose it was raised at a Senate hearing in Washington last year and has been denounced by human rights advocates, who said it might have saved lives by nudging Mr. Kibaki to accept a negotiated settlement more quickly.
 Exit polls, of course, are not always accurate, and it is impossible to know if events might have played out differently had the institute publicized the results, as it has usually done elsewhere. But in Kenya's highly contested election, this particular exit poll, conducted by an experienced American organization, might have been the best gauge of who really won. 
 An examination by The New York Times found that the official explanation for withholding the poll -- that it was technically flawed -- had been disputed by at least four people involved in the institute's Kenya operations. The examination, including interviews and a review of e-mail messages and internal memorandums, raises questions about the intentions and priorities of American observers as Kenyans desperately sought credible information about the vote. 
 None of those interviewed professed to know why the institute withheld the results. But the decision was consistent with other American actions that seemed focused on preserving stability in Kenya, rather than determining the actual winner.
 When Mr. Kibaki claimed victory on Dec. 30, 2007, the State Department quickly congratulated him and called on Kenyans to accept the outcome, even though international observers had reported instances of serious ballot-counting fraud. American officials backed away from their endorsement the next day and ultimately pushed the deal that made Mr. Odinga prime minister.
 After insisting for months that the poll was flawed, the institute released it last August -- long past the point of diplomatic impact -- after outside experts whom it had hired determined that it was valid. It showed Mr. Kibaki losing by about six percentage points. 
 The institute would not make anyone available for interviews. In written responses to questions, a spokeswoman, Lisa Gates, said that the decision to withhold the results was based on ''a lack of confidence in the data, nothing else,'' and that any suggestions that it was at the behest of the United States government were ''completely false.'' To clear its name, the institute has asked that the State Department inspector general look into whether the poll was withheld ''at the request of U.S. government officials,'' she said.
 ''Had I.R.I. released a poll which we had reason to believe was incorrect,'' she said, ''The New York Times would be asking -- quite rightly -- how we could have been so cavalier and irresponsible.'' The outside experts' review, she said, showed that the initial results were off by two percentage points.
 American Preferences
 The institute, which is mostly government financed, conducts campaign workshops, polling and election monitoring in emerging democracies. It has earned praise from elected officials in many countries. But at times, it has also been accused of meddling. In Haiti, for example, a former American ambassador asserted that the institute's operatives undermined reconciliation efforts among political opponents, contributing to a coup in 2004. The institute denied it.
 The institute has worked in Kenya since 1992, but the 2007 presidential election provided its most high-profile assignment yet: monitoring the vote and conducting an exit poll for the United States Agency for International Development. 
 Despite initial economic successes and popular support after his election in 2002, Mr. Kibaki had gained a reputation for playing divisive tribal politics, and his administration had become tainted by scandal. Still, he had a good relationship with the Bush administration and generally supported American counterterrorism policies in East Africa. 
 Mr. Odinga was viewed skeptically by some in Washington because of his flamboyant manner and his background: he was educated in East Germany and named his son after Fidel Castro.
 Heading the institute's Kenya operations in 2007 was Mr. Flottman, on leave from his job as a senior counsel for a major defense contractor. His position put him in close proximity to Western officials in Kenya, including the American ambassador, Michael E. Ranneberger, a career diplomat appointed in 2006. Mr. Flottman said he was surprised when, before the election, Mr. Ranneberger made public comments praising Mr. Kibaki and minimizing Kenyan corruption.
 Behind the scenes, Mr. Flottman recalled, the ambassador was even more direct. A few months before the election, Mr. Ranneberger proposed releasing a voter survey showing Mr. Kibaki ahead and trying to block a roughly simultaneous one favoring Mr. Odinga, according to Mr. Flottman, who said he witnessed the episode during a meeting at the ambassador's office. The suggestion was dropped, he said, after the embassy learned that the pro-Odinga results were already out.
 ''It was clear, in my opinion, that the ambassador was trying to influence the perceptions of the Kenyan electorate, and thus the campaign,'' Mr. Flottman said. 
 In an interview, Mr. Ranneberger said it would have made little sense to try to squelch one of many pre-election polls, and he called the suggestion that he had tried to tilt the outcome toward Mr. Kibaki ''utter nonsense.'' He added, ''Odinga praised me for being very evenhanded.'' 
 Deepening Disquiet
 Another episode deepened Mr. Flottman's unease. As the institute assembled its monitoring delegation, the ambassador objected to plans to include his predecessor, Mark Bellamy, according to two delegation members and a former State Department official. The institute withdrew the invitation, citing budget constraints.
 ''I don't know the reason why the ambassador wanted Mark off, but he did,'' said one delegation member, Joel D. Barkan. He added, ''Perhaps somebody in the Kenya government made comments along the way.''
 Mr. Flottman reached the same conclusion during a conversation in which the ambassador remarked that the Kibaki camp viewed Mr. Bellamy as ''antigovernment,'' according to an e-mail message that Mr. Flottman sent to institute officials in Washington shortly afterward.
 ''In sum,'' Mr. Flottman wrote, ''the ambassador indicates respect for our independence, but seems to have some agenda in regard to the election itself.''
 Mr. Ranneberger disputed that characterization, saying that he played no role in Mr. Bellamy's removal. Mr. Bellamy declined to comment.
 Under its contract, the institute was expected to consult with the Agency for International Development and the embassy before releasing the exit poll results, taking into account the poll's technical quality and ''other key diplomatic interests.'' 
 Quality was not expected to be a concern. In addition to retaining a local polling firm it had used since 2000, the institute contracted with Clark C. Gibson, chairman of the political science department at the University of California, San Diego, to oversee the design of the questions, the surveying of voters and the collection of data.
 When the voting ended and ballot-counting began, Mr. Gibson and others involved in the exit poll said they expected its results to be announced soon.
 But senior institute officials decided to withhold it. Most opposed to releasing the numbers, Mr. Flottman said, was Constance Berry Newman, the institute board member leading the monitoring delegation. In an e-mail message to another delegation member shortly after the election, Mr. Flottman said Ms. Newman opposed ''any kind of release from the outset -- essentially suggesting it would be inflammatory and irresponsible.''
 Ms. Newman, who had worked with Mr. Ranneberger when she was the Bush administration's assistant secretary of state for African affairs, declined to comment. Mr. Ranneberger said he recalled speaking briefly with Ms. Newman or another institute official about the exit poll but had no role in deciding whether to release it. 
 By Dec. 29, two days after the voting, trouble was brewing. The Kenyan electoral commission's tally showed that Mr. Odinga's 370,000-vote lead had shrunk to 38,000 and was still dropping, prompting accusations of fraud. Demonstrators took to the streets in several cities, setting fires and threatening members of rival tribes. The next day, paramilitary officers converged on the ballot-counting center, and the commission chairman, on state-owned radio, declared Mr. Kibaki the winner. 
 Push for Information
 Among those aware of the exit poll, there was rising clamor for its release.
 ''With the breakdown of the electoral commission, that is precisely the point when you want an exit poll to be released,'' said Mr. Barkan, a Kenya expert and a senior associate at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. 
 The institute remained silent until Jan. 15, 2008, when it issued a statement citing ''concerns about the validity of the initial results.''
 In February, with Mr. Kibaki resisting calls to share power, the leaders of two Kenyan human rights groups wrote an opinion article for The Times, saying the refusal to release the poll had ''fueled mistrust.'' After the poll was mentioned during a Senate hearing, the institute stepped up its public criticism of the poll, saying it ''does not have confidence in the integrity of the data and therefore believes the poll is invalid.''
 Mr. Gibson said he told the institute that its technical concerns were baseless, to no avail. His contract barred him from publicly disclosing the polling data for six months, and in March of last year the institute asked him to sign a new contract that would have restricted him from speaking publicly about the institute's polling program without written permission.
 ''I think they were trying to shut me up,'' he said. ''I refused to sign it.''
 In July, after his contract expired, Mr. Gibson and one of his doctoral students presented their analysis of the data at a seminar in Washington. A month later -- one day before Mr. Gibson was to testify before Kenyan investigators -- the institute announced that, after the outside review, it ''now had confidence'' in the poll and released the results. 
 For Mr. Odinga, bitterness lingers. He declined to sign a letter the institute drafted last month that amounted to an unqualified endorsement of its conduct. Instead, he wrote that while he appreciated the institute's past work, ''the 2007 experience has cast some doubts among ordinary Kenyans.''
 ''While I have no evidence to make me believe that I.R.I. withheld the exit poll results at the request of the U.S. government,'' Mr. Odinga wrote, ''my supporters believe that had I.R.I. released those polls, they would have made a huge difference and even saved lives.''

HEADLINE: Better Answers Sought on Banks' Use of Aid

BYLINE: By DAVID STOUT

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Banking institutions that are benefiting from the $700 billion federal rescue program for their industry should be pressed to better explain what they are doing with the money, a government investigative agency said Friday. 
 A report by the Government Accountability Office, an investigative arm of Congress, said the Treasury Department had been better able to track the money flow recently by starting a monthly survey of the program's 20 biggest beneficiaries. 
 Nonetheless, the report said, ''we continue to believe that additional action is needed to better ensure that all participating institutions are accountable for their use of program funds.''
 Moreover, the report said, it may be a long time before the effects of the Troubled Asset Relief Program can be gauged accurately, given the time lag in gathering and assessing data and the other economic forces at play. 
 Since the program was rushed through Congress and signed by former President George W. Bush last fall to counter what seemed to be an imminent, catastrophic breakdown in the nation's financial system, it has been the subject of criticism and second-guessing. 
 The G.A.O. said it agreed that speed rather than contemplation was called for when the program was enacted. Still, the agency said, ''The lack of a clearly articulated vision has complicated Treasury's ability to effectively communicate to Congress, the financial markets and the public on the benefits of TARP.'' 
 As of Jan. 23, the Treasury Department had distributed about $293.7 billion of the $700 billion, the G.A.O. said. Of the $293.7 billion, about $194.2 billion has been spent to shore up 317 financial institutions by buying preferred shares in those firms, the report said. (The document is posted at www.gao.gov.)
 As originally conceived, the TARP program was supposed to help banks by buying up their ''toxic assets,'' or tangled mortgage-backed investments whose values plunged with the problems in the housing industry. Then the Treasury Department under the Bush administration changed course, electing to help banks with infusions of capital, with the aim of encouraging the banks to lend more.
 But too many banks, still nervous about the true value of their assets, have hoarded their new capital instead of making it available to would-be borrowers, critics of the banking industry have said repeatedly. The Obama administration has said that it wants to use the program more aggressively to aid homeowners facing foreclosure.
 The $700 billion bank-rescue program is distinct from the $800 billion-plus economic stimulus program put forward by President Obama and approved this week by the House. 
 In a letter replying to the G.A.O. report, Neel Kashkari, the interim assistant Treasury secretary who has been running the TARP program, noted that it was still ''very young.''
 ''G.A.O.'s report tells us we are on the right path,'' Mr. Kashkari wrote, promising more improvements and thanking the G.A.O. for its ''very constructive recommendations.''

 It is part of a larger Russian push into Latin America to secure new markets, and also to swipe at the United States for what Moscow considers Washington's meddling in Russia's historic sphere of influence, particularly in the former Soviet republics of Ukraine and Georgia. 
 ''Your visit opens a new page in the history of Russian-Cuban relations,'' President Dmitry A. Medvedev said at a meeting with Mr. Castro at the Kremlin on Friday. 
 Russian officials promised the delivery of 25,000 tons of grain and a $20 million loan for the development of Cuba's construction, energy and agriculture sectors. 
 ''Without a doubt, this is a historical moment, an important milestone in the relations between Russia and Cuba'' Mr. Castro said at the meeting. ''We have taken a huge step to strengthen our relationship.''
 High ranking Russian officials have visited Cuba several times in the last year, and Mr. Medvedev made a quick trip there in November as part of a Latin American tour. Trade between the two countries increased 26 percent in 2008, totaling about $239 million, the Kremlin said. 
 ''In the last few years, relations with the United States have become strained, with the United States supporting Ukraine and Georgia in their anti-Russian policies,'' said Igor S. Fesunenko, a Russian journalist and long-time commentator on Latin American affairs. ''And we're thinking, 'oh, how unfortunate that we abandoned Cuba sitting there under America's nose.'''
 Like Venezuela, which played host last fall to two Russian strategic bombers capable of carrying nuclear weapons, Cuba has also had Russian military visitors recently. In December, a contingent of Russia's North Sea Fleet docked in Havana after conducting exercises with Venezuela's navy.
 Neither Mr. Medvedev nor Mr. Castro spoke publicly about possible military cooperation, perhaps out of a desire to avoid antagonizing the new administration of President Obama, analysts said. 
 Since Mr. Obama's election last November, both Russia and Cuba appear to have called a unilateral truce with Washington, and the volume of anti-American sentiment, which has reached deafening pitch in Russia in recent years, has been markedly toned down. 
 ''Regardless of whether the policies of Washington will soften or remain significantly hard-line, relations between Cuba and Russia will develop,'' said Mikhail V. Davydov, director of the Latin American Institute at the Russian Academy of Sciences. 
 Nevertheless, the effects of the global economic crisis have forced Russia to scale back its plans in Latin America, Mr. Davydov and others analysts said.
 Cuba has also reacted cautiously to Russia's overtures due to lingering animosities that emerged when Moscow all but abandoned the country in the 1990s, leaving it impoverished and isolated. 
 Yet, while Mr. Castro's visit clearly does not carry the ideological weight evident at the height of Russia's Cold War relationship with Cuba, vestiges of those bygone days remain.
 At an informal gathering at Mr. Medvedev's country home on Thursday, Mr. Castro waxed nostalgic, recounting the time he and Soviet comrades sat around a camp fire in the forest eating salo, the cured pig fat that is a staple chaser of Russian vodka.
 ''I've desired this for 25 years,'' he said through a Russian translator. 
 In honor of Mr. Castro's visit, federal television channels showed documentaries about Cuba and the Castro brothers. Moscow's Central Museum of the Great Patriotic War, what Russians call World War II, opened a special exhibition covering the history of the Cuban revolution. And Mr. Medvedev congratulated the Cuban people on the revolution's 50th anniversary.

HEADLINE: At a Time of Calls for Painfully Higher Taxes, Some Say the Timing Is Wrong

BYLINE: By PATRICK MCGEEHAN

 BODY:
The increase in the New York City sales tax that Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg proposed on Friday may tack no more than a quarter onto a $100 dinner tab. But it is just the latest addition to a long list of proposed tax, fee and transit fare increases that the city and state governments have sprung on New Yorkers in the past few months.
 While any of those proposed increases might seem insignificant alone, added together they could take a serious bite out of the average taxpayer's earnings. 
 The higher sales tax -- 8.625 percent instead of 8.375 percent -- would apply to almost every sort of purchase, from furniture and books to deliveries of Chinese food. The mayor and Gov. David A. Paterson are also planning to extend the sales tax to some items that have been exempt, including clothing, haircuts, movie tickets and cable TV, according to city officials.
 Those additional bites would come on top of a 7 percent increase in city property taxes that kicked in this month. The state is also considering raising taxes on the wealthy, as well as a utility tax that would push up power bills and new taxes on certain soft drinks, plastic grocery bags and music downloads. 
 Moreover, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which plans to raise fares for its subways, buses and commuter railroads, has asked the state to impose tolls on bridges over the Harlem and East Rivers and has proposed a regional payroll tax to help close its $1.2 billion shortfall.
 ''There's a whole lot in the water,'' said Edmund J. McMahon, director of the Empire Center for New York State Policy, a conservative economic research group. 
 It is far from clear whether all, or any, of the proposed increases will be enacted. But the depth of the fiscal crises facing Albany, City Hall and the transportation authority has left elected officials with two main choices: slash spending or raise taxes. Increasingly, it appears that they will have to do both. 
 But among economists, there is much debate over whether increasing such a broad range of taxes, fees, tolls and fares -- which comes as the federal government is trying to stimulate spending -- could worsen the state and city economies. 
 Mr. McMahon, for one, believes it will. ''It's not a great idea to raise any taxes in a recession,'' he said.
 But some economists argue that the city and state have little choice but to raise taxes if they want to avoid deep cuts to essential services. The transportation authority, for instance, has proposed eliminating several bus and subway lines. 
 A better solution would be to raise the tax rate on incomes above a certain level by as much as 1 percentage point, said Joseph E. Stiglitz, a Nobel Prize-wining economist who teaches at Columbia University. He said fears that an incremental increase in taxes on high earners would trigger a stampede for the borders were unfounded.
 ''That's not going to motivate anybody to move out of the state of New York or the city of New York,'' Mr. Stiglitz said. ''New York is a very attractive place to live -- if there are jobs.''
 And indeed, there is support among many Democrats in the Legislature for raising income taxes on wealthier households, perhaps those earning more than $250,000.
 Still, many elected officials seem to want to avoid raising broadly based taxes on the grounds that it will damage an already stumbling economy. 
 For that reason, David Brunori, a professor of public policy at George Washington University who studies state and local tax policies, said discussions of such increases were rare these days in state capitals. ''With respect to income taxes, there's a perception widely held that income taxes will deter economic development and lead to job loss,'' he said.
 Indeed, Governor Paterson said the budget he presented last month contained no broadly based tax increases. Instead, he proposed a variety of more targeted taxes, such as an 18 percent tax on ''nondiet soft drinks'' and extended the sales tax to cover cable and satellite TV and radio and a range of services including massages and hair care. 
 Mayor Bloomberg intends to impose the city sales tax on those same services. In theory, that means the cost of a haircut or a subscription to HBO would rise by nearly 9 percent.
 Customers of the city's main power supplier, Con Edison, will also feel an extra pinch. The governor's proposal to increase an obscure tax on utilities would raise the typical monthly bill for a residential customer of Con Ed by $2.10, or about 1.7 percent, according to James Denn, a spokesman for the state's Public Service Commission.
 Many liberal economists call sales taxes and fare increases regressive because they take a bigger proportion out of the incomes of poorer people. They have urged the governor and mayor to raise taxes on the incomes of wealthier people, instead.
 ''This is really a very bad policy in the context of the current economic downturn,'' Mr. Stiglitz said. ''If you are going to raise taxes in a recession, raising sales taxes is among the worst possible ideas.''
 Stephen Kagann, who was the chief economist for Gov. George E. Pataki, a Republican, agrees -- but only in part. Raising any taxes, he says, would hurt the economy, blaming steady tax increases during the 1970s for exacerbating the loss of jobs in New York State. 
 ''To raise taxes at this time, during a recession, guarantees that jobs are going to be lost in greater numbers than they would under normal circumstances,'' Mr. Kagann said.

HEADLINE: Obama Moves to Reverse Bush's Labor Policies

BYLINE: By DAVID STOUT

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
On yet another morning of grim economic news, President Obama sought to further distance himself from his predecessor on Friday as he announced steps that he said would strengthen organized labor and improve the lot of middle-class Americans.
 At a White House ceremony, the president signed three executive orders that he said would ''reverse many of the policies towards organized labor that we've seen these last eight years, policies with which I've sharply disagreed.'' 
 Soon afterward, Vice President Biden drew applause when he flung another dart at former President George W. Bush and former Vice President Dick Cheney (on Mr. Cheney's 68th birthday) as he told labor officials in the audience, ''Welcome back to the White House.''
 Mr. Obama, following up on his Thursday condemnation of ''shameful'' bonuses for Wall Street bankers, seized on the latest economic numbers to push yet again for enactment of his $800 billion-plus economic stimulus package. He and Mr. Biden spoke not long after the nation's gross domestic product reflected its greatest contraction in a quarter-century.
 ''So this is a difficult moment,'' Mr. Obama said, ''but I believe if we act boldly and swiftly it can be an American moment, when we work through our differences together and overcome our divisions to face this crisis.''
 ''While our G.D.P. may have grown smaller, it's undiminished when it comes to our innovative spirit, our work ethic, our values and our resolve and resilience as Americans,'' the president said.
 The orders he signed, which union officials say will undo Bush administration policies that tilted toward employers, would require federal contractors to offer jobs to current workers when contracts change, and would make it more difficult for federal contractors to discourage union activities.
 In addition, Mr. Biden said the first meeting of the previously announced task force ''to bring together those Cabinet members who have the greatest impact on the well-being of the middle class'' would be Feb. 27 in Philadelphia. The task force will look at issues as diverse as health care and college opportunities, Mr. Biden said, and will focus on ''restoring the balance in the workplace.''
 The task force will be led by Jared Bernstein, a prominent liberal economist who has been writing a study on the impact of Mr. Obama's stimulus plan. The focus of the first meeting will be ''green jobs, those jobs that pay well, can't be outsourced and will help us move toward a cleaner, more self-sufficient energy future,'' Mr. Biden said.
 Future monthly meetings will be held across the country to discuss the mundane but essential concerns of working people like child care, workplace safety and retirement security, the vice president said. The administration has set up a Web site, AStrongMiddleClass.gov, that Mr. Biden said would tell people what their government was doing and invite them to share their thoughts.
 The president and vice president did not precisely define the ''middle class,'' a term used in conversation and politics to describe aspirations as well as income levels. But it was clear that they were not speaking of the Wall Street people who shared in the enormous bonuses that Mr. Obama denounced on Thursday.
 ''These are the men and the women who form the backbone of our economy, the most productive workers in the world,'' Mr. Obama said.
 When Mr. Bush was president, he often used virtually identical language in describing American workers, but he generally emphasized entrepreneurship and small business more than Mr. Obama and Mr. Biden did today. 
 ''I do not view the labor movement as part of the problem,'' Mr. Obama said. ''To me, it's part of the solution.'' 
 But the president said there need not be a conflict between ''the interests of workers and the interests of shareholders,'' and that American business and industry could be ''lean and mean'' and thus competitive in the global marketplace.
 Mr. Biden said that, by lifting the middle class, the new administration would improve life for the poor -- ''and by the way, the wealthy do better as well. Everyone does better.'' 
 Mr. Obama's and Mr. Biden's remarks pleased union leaders. ''It's a new day for workers,'' said James P. Hoffa, the Teamsters president, who attended the White House ceremony. ''We finally have a White House that is dedicated to working with us to rebuild our middle class. Hope for the American Dream is being restored.''

HEADLINE: Getting Theirs

BYLINE: By ERIC DASH and LOUISE STORY; Zachery Kouwe contributed reporting.

 BODY:
There was none of the old swagger at Citigroup headquarters on Friday. The bonus checks had landed -- and some of the bankers were grumbling. 
 After a year of yawning losses at the company, employees lamented that times were getting lean. The giant bank, the recipient of two multibillion-dollar rescues from Washington, had paid out only about $4 billion in bonuses. 
 Only? 
 If you've never worked on Wall Street, it is hard to wrap your head around the idea that a company that lost nearly $19 billion in a single year, as Citigroup did in 2008, could still pay its employees billions in bonuses. It is probably even harder to believe that some of those employees grumble about it. 
 ''I feel like I got a doorman's tip, compared to what I got in previous years,'' said a 30-something investment banking associate at Citigroup's offices in Lower Manhattan. 
 That kind of glum talk is being heard all over Wall Street, where money is the measure and bonuses the ultimate yardstick. To bankers and traders, bonuses, which account for the bulk of their pay, justify those long days and sleepless nights spent crunching numbers or watching bond prices dance across computer screens.
 But with everyone from President Obama on down chastising bankers for paying themselves billions in bonuses at a time taxpayer money is propping up the financial industry, once-unthinkable questions are starting to arise. Could bonuses, the stuff of Wall Street dreams, become a thing of the past? Could this decades-old incentive system, born of the private partnerships that once ruled Wall Street, be replaced? If so, by what? 
 For all the tectonic shifts reshaping the financial landscape, one thing has not changed: the bonus culture. Wall Streeters who make a lot of money for their employers expect to reap the rewards. In the parlance of the industry, they expect to eat what they kill.
 But bonus resentment is building. On Friday, Senator Claire McCaskill, Democrat of Missouri, proposed a bill to cap workers' pay at banks that received bailout money at $400,000, including bonuses. Even now, with Wall Street awash in red ink, stars are pulling down millions.
 ''It's just not acceptable. You're talking about the same banks that caused the foreclosure crisis, took record bonuses in the past and continue to,'' said George Goehl, executive director of National Training and Information Center, a nonprofit community reinvestment group in Chicago. 
 Some politicians are calling for banks to claw back bonuses because they were based on earnings that vanished in the financial crisis. President Obama lashed out on Thursday, calling bankers shameful for awarding themselves nearly $20 billion in bonuses for 2008.
 Many senior banking executives, including Vikram S. Pandit, the chief executive of Citigroup, agreed to forgo 2008 bonuses. But Washington policy makers did not limit bonuses for rank-and-file employees when the government hastily arranged the sweeping bailout last fall. So banks were free to pay what they wished for 2008, and pay they did. 
 At Citigroup, Mr. Pandit in November was planning to reduce the total bonus pool by about 40 percent from 2007 levels. But after the company grabbed a second lifeline from Washington, executives reduced payouts even more, cutting the total in half, according to several people close to the situation. One of those people said officials in the Treasury Department, then under Henry M. Paulson Jr., signed off on the size and the structure of the compensation plan. Pay for several dozen of Citigroup's senior managers was cut between 40 and 85 percent, and the bank imposed new policies to claw back ill-gotten bonuses and limit severance pay. 
 That could set the stage for a new round of changes. Wall Street compensation in general -- and bonuses in particular -- are coming under intense scrutiny from lawmakers. Possible reforms include caps on pay, greater use of stock compensation and mandates to return more money to shareholders, rather than workers. The government could also request a seat on the board of every company that accepted taxpayer money. 
 Even some bankers, at Citigroup and other institutions, said they felt a bit ashamed about getting bonuses in hard times like this. But none of them offered to return the money. 
 ''I'm certainly not giving my bonus back,'' said the Citigroup banking associate, who, like other several other Citigroup employees, declined to disclose his payout and asked to remain anonymous, for fear of angering his bosses. 
 Granted, bonuses are down from the heady days of the bull market. According to an estimate released this week by the New York State comptroller, which set off the recent uproar, payouts for 2008 at New York financial companies fell about 44 percent from the previous year. But bankers are still taking home about as much as they did in 2004, when the industry was flush.
 A confluence of powerful forces drove bonuses to record heights in recent years. 
 Traditionally, banks set aside about half of their annual revenue for employees' compensation. But since the 1970s, and particularly over the past decade or so, the financial industry boomed, and so did pay. In recent years, the explosive growth of lucrative areas like hedge funds and private equity unleashed a war for talent, inflating pay and employees' expectations even more. 
 But for many banks and their employees, the old calculus of risk and reward also changed. 
 For most of their histories, traditional Wall Street banks like Goldman Sachs and Lehman Brothers were private partnerships. Partners staked their own money in the markets. When firms went public, Wall Street used shareholders' money. Banks also were able to reward employees with both cash and stock, and bonuses assumed a larger role in total compensation. 
 By 2007, just before the financial crisis hit, the average worker in the financial industry was earning 70 percent more than counterparts in other fields. 
 The bonus culture runs deep. Executives and rank-and-file workers argue that lawmakers and others who complain about bonuses do not understand how this industry works. Bonuses, Wall Streeters say, are a crucial part of total compensation, and are often treated as deferred salaries. And generally bosses weigh individual performance more heavily than the company's overall results. 
 In other words, people who made the company a fortune in, say, foreign exchange trading, deserve bonuses even if their colleagues in mortgage bonds ran up losses that crippled the bank. 
 At Citigroup, for instance, bonuses for currency and interest rate traders, who as a group had a good year, fell 40 to 50 percent. Bonuses for senior bankers shrank by about the same amount. But junior bankers, whose bonuses are smaller, were not cut as much. Some mortgage traders got no bonuses at all.
 ''Compensation will vary based on each person's performance -- again, relative to the overall performance of the company,'' Mr. Pandit said in a year-end memo outlining the bank's pay principles in 2008. 
 Of course, many Wall Street employees never expected the good times to end. They lived large, believing bonuses would always arrive, so they are ill prepared, both emotionally and financially, to cope with a sudden drop in income. 
 ''Without a doubt, $18 billion is a lot of money, but it's a drop in the bucket on Wall Street,'' said Gustavo Dolfino, president of the WhiteRock Group, a headhunter for the banks. ''These bonuses are down, and the salaries are not enough for these people. They can't live on $150 to $180,000, so they haven't saved any money. They put it on credit lines and at bonus time, they thought they'd pay it off.''

HEADLINE: Stimulus Plan Encounters Stiff Resistance in Senate

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Senate Republicans and even some Democrats are pressing for big changes to the $819 billion economic stimulus package the House passed this week, setting the stage for a bruising debate over tax cuts and spending that will test the Obama White House. 
 The demand for major changes comes amid mounting criticism from some economists that the bill does not focus tightly enough on government programs that will quickly create jobs or tax breaks that will spark spending by consumers and businesses. 
 Not a single Republican voted for the version of the bill that the Democratic-controlled House approved this week. But with the economy in grave trouble, some Senate Republicans clearly want to find a way to support the bill, and President Obama wants a strong bipartisan vote to show his ability to build consensus. 
 Republicans and some prominent Democrats said they would push to add or expand initiatives to prop up the collapsed housing market, which was a major cause of the recession. Democratic leaders said they were open to the ideas, including a $15,000 tax credit for homebuyers. 
 Republicans said they would put forward numerous amendments, especially broader and deeper tax cuts, and efforts to strip out some major spending provisions that support long-term policy goals of Mr. Obama and Congressional Democrats but may not provide a quick jolt to the economy. 
 The Republicans also said they intended to remove several provisions that they say smack of special-interest pet projects, including disaster insurance for honey producers.
 At a strategy session on Thursday with Mr. Obama's top economic adviser, Lawrence H. Summers, Democrats and the White House agreed to allow full-throated debate on the stimulus in the Senate rather than try to jam the bill through with a small margin of victory. At a minimum, Democrats need at least two Senate Republicans if they are to muster the 60 votes needed to pre-empt any filibuster.
 Already, the Senate version of the bill is substantially different from the House package, including a provision to protect millions of middle-class Americans from having to pay the alternative minimum tax in 2009 that brings the total cost of the Senate bill to nearly $890 billion. Reconciling the two versions will require further negotiations with House leaders after the Senate acts. Floor debate is expected to last through next week. 
 It is not clear how much the White House is willing to compromise, and a push from Mr. Obama's Democratic former colleagues in the Senate for strong efforts to help the housing market could generate some of the most intense negotiations. 
 Senator Kent Conrad, Democrat of North Dakota and chairman of the Budget Committee, has said that the stimulus does not address foreclosure problems at the root of the recession. 
 Mr. Obama's aides have promised to devote $50 billion to $100 billion from the Treasury's bailout program to mitigate foreclosures, but have yet to announce the specific programs they intend to pursue. 
 Mr. Conrad and other Democrats are also pushing for more spending on public works projects that can be undertaken swiftly for rapid job creation. 
 ''The majority opinion is the people want jobs, jobs, jobs,'' Senator Ben Nelson, Democrat of Nebraska, said Friday in a television interview. ''To do that, you have to go to those programs far more like infrastructure, construction, roads, bridges, other kinds of infrastructure, even let's say, money to help rebuild and build schools.'' 
 Mr. Nelson said that he was in talks with Republican colleagues including Senator Susan Collins of Maine and his fellow Nebraskan, Senator Mike Johanns, about changes to the bill. 
 In a conference call with reporters on Friday, Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York, said Democrats were working on an amendment that would increase the focus on infrastructure projects. 
 Senator Robert F. Bennett, Republican of Utah, said Democrats should break out pieces of the huge stimulus that both parties agree will work quickly and approve them.
 ''You could take the $30 billion for roads and bridges that is truly shovel-ready and pass that this afternoon,'' Mr. Bennett said. ''Let's pick those pieces out, pass them right away and then say, O.K., this is a down payment on the $800 billion.'' 
 Some Republicans are also pushing to allow all creditworthy homeowners to refinance their mortgages at rates of 4.5 percent or lower. 
 Provisions in the plan that have drawn criticism in both parties include $400 million for research and prevention of sexually transmitted diseases, and tens of millions for renovations to government buildings including the headquarters of the Commerce and Agriculture Departments.

HEADLINE: It's Not the Bonus Money. It's the Principle.

BYLINE: By JOE NOCERA

 BODY:
And on the ninth day, the president jawboned.
 How else to describe what President Obama did on Thursday, his ninth day in office? Angered by news that Wall Street was doling out $18.4 billion in bonuses for 2008 -- ''the sixth-largest haul on record,'' according to a front-page article in The New York Times, despite billions upon billions in losses -- the president called reporters in and looked sternly into the cameras. Then he unloaded on Wall Street executives, just as President John F. Kennedy once unloaded on the country's steel barons. 
 ''That is the height of irresponsibility,'' Mr. Obama said sharply, referring to the bonuses. ''It is shameful.'' Wall Street, he said, was coming to the government for badly needed help -- which taxpayers were providing because otherwise ''the entire system could come down on top of our heads'' -- and the government had a right to expect in return that Wall Street would ''show some restraint and show some discipline and show some sense of responsibility.'' After going on in this vein for a while, he slapped around Citigroup for agreeing to take that new $50 million corporate jet after agreeing to a huge bailout in November. The government's demand that the plane be canceled should have been unnecessary ''because they should know better,'' he scolded.
 Mr. Obama didn't take a shot at John Thain, the former chief executive of Merrill Lynch, who was pushed out last week by his new boss, Ken Lewis, at Bank of America, after Merrill reported a $15.3 billion loss in the fourth quarter. But then, he didn't have to. The revelation that Mr. Thain had spent $1.2 million remodeling his office shortly after joining Merrill in 2007 -- and more recently allotted big bonuses to Merrill's troops even as the firm's red ink was forcing Bank of America to seek more government help -- has transformed Mr. Thain into the new Richard Fuld. He's the person Americans would most like to punch in the nose. 
 This week, American companies announced somewhere around 65,000 layoffs. Caterpillar, Kodak, Home Depot, I.B.M., even mighty Microsoft: they are all cutting jobs. Everywhere in the United States, people are feeling the pain of this deepening recession. Even those with jobs worry about their futures. Their 401(k) plans have been decimated. They are frightened and angry. 
 Which is why Wall Street should not be surprised that oversize bonuses and $50 million jets generate outrage -- and tough rejoinders from the president. ''It suggests the selfishness of people on Wall Street,'' said Charles Elson, a corporate governance expert at the University of Delaware, who sounded pretty outraged himself. ''Wall Street has yet to learn the lesson of what happened.'' What happened, put simply, is that the people who thought of themselves as the smartest guys in the room -- and were paid accordingly -- weren't so smart after all. They brought down the financial system. They lost so much money that only the government can save them. The scolding they got from the president this week suggests that they're going to be paying a price -- richly deserved, I might add -- for a good long time.
 When you get right down to it, the purchase of a new plane or an office renovation is pretty meaningless for companies as large as Citigroup or Bank of America. It's not unheard of for executives to spend $1 million or more on remodeling when they get the corner office. It's pocket change. And companies can usually make a halfway decent business case to justify a new airplane. (It goes longer distances than older planes, can take more executives to meetings, allows the top brass to be more efficient and productive, etc., etc.) The question of whether bailout money was used to pay for these perks -- as alleged by The New York Post, which broke the Citi airplane story -- is, at best, ambiguous. Indeed, breaking the airplane contract and sending the jet back to the manufacturer will probably cost the bank more than keeping the plane. 
 None of that matters. You could make the same argument about the auto executives who flew on corporate jets when they came to Washington to ask Congress for help: surely, it was a better use of their time to fly rather than drive from Detroit, as they did the second time around, after being spanked for taking the jets. That didn't matter either. What matters is the symbolism. At a time when the country is in such trouble -- and executives are asking for bailouts -- anything that smacks of plutocracy is going to arouse justifiable populist anger. 
 ''This has been building for 20 years,'' said Richard C. Ferlauto, director of corporate governance for the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees. ''Regular working people haven't gotten ahead in the economy. They understand that tremendous wealth has been created, and they say, 'Where's mine?' '' He continued: ''These guys seem to be living in another universe. So the symbolism of the umbrella stand and the private jet is powerful.'' The umbrella stand, of course, was a reference to the $15,000 umbrella stand that the former Tyco chief executive Dennis Kozlowski bought with company funds -- and that is part of the reason he is now behind bars.
 But there is something else as well. Most people still don't fully understand what, exactly, Wall Street did that caused so much trouble for the country and the financial system. I spoke this week to David M. Smick, author of a scathing book about Wall Street, ''The World Is Curved: Hidden Dangers to the Global Economy.'' In indignant tones, he talked to me about the sophisticated off-balance-sheet vehicles the banks used to hide risk and game the system, and the ''mortgage-backed securities they were shoving out the door.'' He concluded, ''I find their behavior just appalling.''
 But words like ''off-balance-sheet vehicles'' and ''mortgage-backed securities'' don't have much meaning for most of us. What we understand is greed -- which, ultimately, is what Mr. Smick was talking about as well. For most Americans, big bonuses and corporate jets and office remodelings become a kind of stand-in for the real sins of the bankers. They signify what people hate about Wall Street.
 The truth is, this is probably the last year for a good long while that Wall Street bonuses are going to be so out of line with reality. Partly that is because the government simply isn't going to let it happen again, at least not at any institution that has taken bailout money. The top executives at those institutions already have some restrictions on their pay, and there are other, further restrictions in the works at the Treasury Department and in Congress. One proposed new wrinkle would call for bank executives to get most of their bonuses in stock -- which they wouldn't be able to unload until the government was no longer a shareholder in the bank. 
 Bonuses will also go down because, after this year's bonus fiasco, Wall Street finally understands that the public scrutiny is going to be fierce. At many firms, 50 percent or more of revenue goes out the door in the form of compensation. That's simply untenable now. 
 Finally, the business model of the investment banks is almost certainly going to change. Over the last 20 years, investment banking went from being primarily an advisory business to being mostly a business where firms traded for their own accounts -- so-called proprietary trading. It is the trading business that made the banks so immensely profitable. It is also what propelled the creation of mortgage-backed securities and credit-default swaps and all the rest of it. Those vehicles generated both enormous fees and enormous profits.
 But that game is over. ''It will be impossible to rebuild that business model, which relied so heavily on leverage,'' said William Hambrecht, founder and chief executive of the investment firm WR Hambrecht & Company. ''I don't think the government is going to let them take that kind of leverage again.'' And the government will also tightly regulate complex securities. ''So we are faced with an era of sharply reduced profit opportunities, which means a lot less income,'' Mr. Hambrecht added. To him, the big bonuses this year signaled that ''Wall Street hasn't been able to admit that yet.''
 Wall Street traders are also extremely reluctant to give up the ''eat what you kill'' mentality that has dominated their profession these past two decades. There is no sense of shared enterprise at most firms, and no belief among the rank and file that they should have to pay a price if the firm is drowning in losses and needs government support. That is why they are so blind to how they appear to the rest of us. They just want theirs. That is the culture they have created.
 Indeed, Ira Kay, a top executive consultant with Watson Wyatt, told me that this bonus season has been akin to ''war'' inside many Wall Street firms. ''It is a small group of people who caused the problems,'' he said. But other bankers had very good years -- and all over New York they are now complaining about their smaller bonuses, completely tone-deaf to how this sounds outside their Wall Street silos. You can make a pretty convincing argument that that culture -- and the bonuses that flowed from it -- had a lot to do with creating the financial crisis. If Wall Street can't bring itself to admit as much, the new administration and the Democratic Congress are going to be more than happy to point it out.
 It's not just Wall Street, either. I've long thought that the reason executive compensation became such a flashpoint was because it, too, signaled an ''I want mine'' mentality among chief executives. It was infuriating to see them bring home tens of millions of dollars even as their company's stock fell and they laid off employees. Next month, proxy season will begin, and we'll start to see how much not just Wall Street chieftains made in 2008, but also all executives who run public companies. 
 I asked Mr. Kay what we should expect. Did corporate executives understand the need to show that they were willing to sacrifice in these hard times, just like the rest of us -- or will we see them still grasping for every last dime?
 ''I am a little disappointed with the reaction of some of the executives,'' he replied. ''The emphasis on pay-for-performance has gone up to an extent, but the executives are definitely not where their boards are, where the shareholders are, where the media is, or where the government is. They are lagging on this.'' 
 I'm guessing that President Obama is going to be jawboning again before too long.

HEADLINE: Speculation About Where Clinton Will Travel First

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton is clearly itching to hit the road. But to where?
 ''We'll let you know as soon as we get it organized,'' she told reporters earlier this week. ''I'm looking forward to it.''
 A secretary of state's first foreign trip is always an event -- steeped in symbolism and parsed for clues about how the new boss will conduct diplomacy. Mrs. Clinton's celebrity lends the maiden voyage added glitter, but also the burden of great expectations. The choice of the itinerary has been further complicated by the fact that the White House appointed two special emissaries who wasted no time booking their own foreign travel. 
 George J. Mitchell, the special envoy for the Middle East, is halfway through a weeklong tour of the region, visiting Cairo; Jerusalem; the West Bank; Amman, Jordan; and tacking on a stop in Paris. Richard C. Holbrooke, the special representative for Pakistan and Afghanistan, is headed to those countries next week, stopping en route at a security conference in Munich.
 Other senior officials are footloose, too. Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and Gen. James L. Jones, the president's national security adviser, are also heading to the Munich conference. President Obama is traveling to Canada next month for his first foreign trip as president. And in April, he will go to London for a summit meeting on the financial crisis and a NATO meeting jointly hosted by France and Germany. 
 With so many old-world capitals and gritty hot spots spoken for, what's left for a restless secretary of state?
 Asia, according to the latest State Department scuttlebutt.
 While no final decision has been made -- and travel schedules are fickle -- Mrs. Clinton is leaning toward a trip that would include Japan and China, according to officials. That would allow her to check in with a staunch ally and take stock of an economic rival. A stop in South Korea would put Mrs. Clinton close to one of her looming challenges: North Korea's nuclear program.
 Asia is not an obvious choice: her two most recent predecessors, Condoleezza Rice and Colin L. Powell, started off in Europe and the Middle East. Ms. Rice felt obliged to go to Paris and Berlin, one former adviser said, to mend fences after the invasion of Iraq. 
 The Obama administration, officials said, is determined to spread its senior people around. With so many big names trooping off to Europe, they said, Mrs. Clinton can deliver a greater diplomatic punch by going to Asia. Besides, said one old hand, if no one of her stature shows up in Tokyo by April or so, the Japanese will wonder what is wrong with the relationship.
 The political calendar plays a role, too: Israel is holding elections on Feb. 10, and analysts said it would not make sense for Mrs. Clinton to travel there before a new government was in place.
 Secretaries of state have traveled abroad since 1866, when William Henry Seward sailed to the Virgin Islands. But their wanderlust has varied: Ms. Rice racked up more than a million miles on 86 trips. General Powell, who was criticized for being a homebody, still managed 68 trips.
 Mrs. Clinton is expected to fall somewhere in between. She told a recent meeting of senior State Department staff members that she wanted to go on the road only when her presence could make a difference, according to people in the session. That would suggest fewer trips than Ms. Rice, who practically commuted to the Middle East and, critics said, had little to show for it.
 But maybe not that many fewer: Mrs. Clinton, her aides like to note, visited all 62 counties in New York State during her first Senate campaign. And now she will have a bigger plane.

HEADLINE: With a Swipe at Bush, Obama Acts to Bolster Labor

BYLINE: By DAVID STOUT

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
On yet another morning of grim economic news, President Obama sought on Friday to distance himself further from his predecessor, announcing steps that he said would strengthen organized labor and thereby improve the lot of middle-class Americans. 
 At a White House ceremony, the president signed three executive orders that he said would ''reverse many of the policies towards organized labor that we've seen these last eight years, policies with which I've sharply disagreed.''
 Appearing with Mr. Obama, Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. drew applause when he flung another dart at former President George W. Bush, telling labor officials among those in the audience, ''Welcome back to the White House.''
 Mr. Obama and Mr. Biden spoke soon after the Commerce Department announced that gross domestic product contracted at an annual rate of 3.8 percent in the fourth quarter of 2008, the worst shrinking of the economy in more than a quarter-century. Following up on Thursday's condemnation of ''shameful'' bonuses for Wall Street bankers, the new president seized on the latest economic numbers to push yet again for enactment of his $800-billion-plus economic stimulus package.
 ''So this is a difficult moment,'' he said, ''but I believe if we act boldly and swiftly, it can be an American moment, when we work through our differences together and overcome our divisions to face this crisis.''
 ''While our G.D.P. may have grown smaller, it's undiminished when it comes to our innovative spirit, our work ethic, our values and our resolve and resilience as Americans,'' the president said.
 The orders Mr. Obama signed, which union officials say will undo Bush administration policies that tilted toward employers, make it more difficult for federal contractors to discourage union activities. And when a federal contract changes hands, the new contractor will be required to offer jobs to workers who were employed by the earlier contractor. 
 In addition, Mr. Biden said the first meeting of the previously announced task force ''to bring together those cabinet members who have the greatest impact on the well-being of the middle class'' would be held on Feb. 27 in Philadelphia. The task force will look at issues as diverse as health care and college opportunities, Mr. Biden said, and will also focus on ''restoring the balance in the workplace.''
 The task force, with Mr. Biden as chairman, will have as its executive director Jared Bernstein, a prominent liberal economist who has been writing a study on the impact of Mr. Obama's stimulus plan. The focus of the Feb. 27 meeting, Mr. Biden said, will be ''green jobs, those jobs that pay well, can't be outsourced and will help us move toward a cleaner, more self-sufficient energy future.''
 Future monthly meetings will be held across the country to discuss concerns of working people like child care, workplace safety and retirement security, the vice president said. The administration has set up a Web site, AStrongMiddleClass.gov, that Mr. Biden said would tell people what the government was doing and invite them to share their thoughts.

HEADLINE: Hard Times Hit Houses Where Art Meets Cash

BYLINE: By CAROL VOGEL

 BODY:
A sighting of Francois Pinault at Christie's London offices one recent wintry morning set off an avalanche of rumors. Mr. Pinault, the luxury goods magnate who bought the auction house a decade ago, is usually spotted there only when a major evening auction is under way or when there is a viewing of contemporary art, his collecting passion.
 But there were no auctions or contemporary art to see that day. Employees began whispering that Mr. Pinault was there to discuss an impending sale of Christie's to a private-equity firm. 
 ''It's not true,'' said Edward Dolman, its chief executive, sitting in his New York office one afternoon last week. ''Pinault has no intention of selling Christie's.'' 
 The fervid speculation reflects wide curiosity about how Christie's and its archrival, Sotheby's, are coping now that the years of stratospheric prices and high living are over.
 Mr. Pinault, who presides over an empire that includes Gucci, Converse Sneakers and Chateau Latour -- brands that undoubtedly will be affected by the global economic crisis -- is said to be in better shape than many. He recently negotiated a deal with French banks for two-year relief on his credit, experts on the auction business said. 
 For every tale spun about Christie's there is a competing one about Sotheby's. As a public company traded on the New York Stock Exchange, it has seen its stock fall to just over $8 a share, from a high of $61.40 in 2007, stirring speculation that it could be snapped up at a bargain price. 
 William F. Ruprecht, Sotheby's chief executive, dismissed that possibility. ''There are absolutely no discussions or plans about selling the business,'' he said in a telephone interview.
 Like banks, auto manufacturers and insurance companies that are struggling to stay afloat, however, Sotheby's and Christie's are laying off scores of employees in their offices around the world, restructuring departments and cutting costs in every area. 
 Sotheby's laid off some 60 people in the United States in December. Two weeks ago Christie's let go some 100 employees and began consolidating departments in New York, combining old master paintings and drawings with 19th-century art and merging areas like European furniture, 19th-century furniture, porcelain, silver and rugs into one large European furniture and decorative arts department.
 Both auction houses are also laying off people in Europe but at a slower pace, because employment laws there pose more obstacles. Sotheby's, which had employed more than 1,555 people worldwide, estimates that 250 will lose their jobs. Christie's, which had a total staff of about 2,100, predicts a loss of about 300. 
 Over the last few years when times were good, sales large and profits hefty, the companies increased their head counts considerably. 
 But to win business they also routinely took risks, granting sellers everything from guarantees -- in which they were promised undisclosed sums regardless of a sale's outcome -- to a share of the premiums paid by buyers. Such practices proved perilous last fall, when art prices plummeted, and the companies logged millions of dollars in losses.
 Almost immediately the companies announced the end of financial deals. 
 ''It's largely a return to the history of what our business once was -- agents for buyers and sellers,'' Mr. Ruprecht said. 
 Ever competitive, he argues that Sotheby's and Christie's are following ''different business models.'' Sotheby's, he said, is now concentrating on what it calls the high end of the art market: the average value of a Sotheby's lot last year was $125,000, Mr. Ruprecht said, compared with about $50,000 at Christie's.
 Yet that difference can largely be explained by the lower-priced salesroom that Christie's operates in South Kensington in London, which attracts thousands of collectors with a continuous schedule of sales and regularly scoops up the chattel of English country-house estates. (Sotheby's tried to imitate that practice, opening a 54,000-square-foot space at Olympia in West London in 2001. It closed last year.)
 Mr. Dolman scoffed at Mr. Ruprecht's assertion that Sotheby's has the monopoly on the high end of the market. ''Out of the top six most expensive works sold at auction in 2008, Christie's sold four,'' he said.
 Unsurprisingly, each house's sales next month of Impressionist, Modern, postwar and contemporary art in London will be less than half the size they were a year ago, when a triptych by Francis Bacon fetched $51.6 million, and a landscape by the German Expressionist Franz Marc brought $24.3 million, a record for the artist's works at auction. 
 Surrounding activities have been scaled back accordingly. Gone are the lavish parties for potential buyers, big bonuses for in-house experts and, except for the best pieces, the presale travels of prized paintings to art-buying capitals like Moscow and Hong Kong. 
 Until recently, Sotheby's and Christie's spent hundreds of thousands of dollars producing sumptuous catalogs, often mailing them overnight to clients around the globe. Now the catalogs are shrinking. As fewer works come to auction, the illustrations are less lavish, and there are fewer pages of art historical essays. 
 As the need for catalog staff, junior experts and administrators has diminished, those areas have undergone the biggest cuts. Yet several experts in areas ranging from Impressionist and postwar art to furniture and old master paintings have received pink slips too. 
 ''Our staff reductions are a need to match the business with the scale of the market over the next 24 months,'' Mr. Dolman said, adding with some understatement, ''It's unlikely we'll see 2006-2007 sales results in the short term.'' 
 Despite the global economic crisis, neither Sotheby's nor Christie's is planning to scale back recent efforts to build markets in Russia, elsewhere in Asia or the Middle East. Most of the people they rely on in those countries are not full-time employees but rather advisers or consultants, which makes the cost of maintaining offices there relatively modest. 
 No one knows when the global economy will hit bottom, of course. ''Is this it, or are things going to get worse?'' Mr. Ruprecht reflected aloud.
 There will always be people for whom collecting art is a fierce passion, he pointed out, although far fewer will have the means. 
 ''You will see fewer bidders, especially from some of the emerging markets,'' he said. ''But I think there's a foundation of great collectors with great wealth who continue to be consumed with art.''
