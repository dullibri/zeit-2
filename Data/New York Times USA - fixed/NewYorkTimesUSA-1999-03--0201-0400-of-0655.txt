Loss Widens at British American Tobacco

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: LONDON, March 9

 BODY:
British American Tobacco P.L.C. said today that its loss in the fourth quarter had widened, reflecting costs to the company of the $206 billion settlement between cigarette makers and 46 American states, and it warned that operating profit in the current quarter was likely to be below the level a year earlier.
The big cigarette maker has been hurt by the settlement in the United States and by the economic problems of emerging markets since it was created in September when the predecessor company, B.A.T. Industries, split its tobacco activities from its financial services interests. 
 "It's clearly going to take a year or two for their earnings growth to get back on track," said Trevor Moss at Robert Fleming Securities.
(In Switzerland today, Zurich Financial Services, created by the merger of the B.A.T. financial operations and the Zurich Insurance Company, said it would take a $2.4 billion charge to integrate the operations, nearly double its previous estimate.)
In the fourth quarter, British American Tobacco's loss grew to £171 million, or $275 million, from £163 million a year earlier. About £463 million of settlement costs were recorded in the quarter. The company's Asian-Pacific operations incurred a loss of £21 million.
The performance in the quarter pushed full-year profit down 16 percent, to £346 million.
On the American Stock Exchange, the company's American depository receipts, each of which represents 2 shares, declined 25 cents, to $18.375.

HEADLINE: Fluor to Cut 5,000 Jobs and Reorganize Operations

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK 

DATELINE: IRVINE, Calif., March 9

 BODY:
The Fluor Corporation, suffering from the Asian economic crisis and its own bloated cost structure, said today that it would cut 5,000 employees, reorganize its operations, and narrow the range of construction projects it undertakes.
Fluor, the nation's largest engineering and construction company, said the moves were expected to reduce overhead costs by $160 million annually but would require a $130 million pretax charge against earnings in the current quarter. 
 "We have a cost structure that is unsustainable," Philip J. Carroll, the company's chairman and chief executive, told shareholders at the annual meeting here today. He said a reorganization would have been needed even if business conditions had been better.
But those conditions continue to deteriorate. The company said today that it expected only $6 billion in new construction orders this year, about half the level of two years ago and less than the $8 billion it had previously been forecasting for this year.
Fluor said it expected to record net income this fiscal year of $107 million, or $1.42 a share, after the restructuring charge. That is less than half the $235 million, or $2.97 a diluted share, it earned last year on revenues of $13.5 billion. Even excluding the charge, which amounts to $1.23 a share, expected earnings of $2.65 a share are below the $2.99 or so that analysts have been estimating.
Fluor shares closed today at $34.3125, down $1.75. The shares, which have traded as high as $52.50 in the last year, are near their 12-month low of $33.25.
The construction industry has been buffeted by the Asian financial crisis, which derailed many large projects. The Asian crisis also helped precipitate a decline in oil prices, slowing capital spending by oil companies, which are prime Fluor customers. Fluor's A. T. Massey coal production subsidiary, meanwhile, has been hurt by weak domestic steel production caused in part by an influx of cheaper steel from abroad.
The 5,000 job cuts amount to about 9 percent of the nearly 57,000 employees the company had at the end of last fiscal year. The cuts are coming mainly from salaried employees in the engineering and construction division, and constitute nearly 20 percent of that group. Some 1,000 of the cuts will be in staff-support positions, which constitute overhead, and 4,000 will be of people working directly on construction projects. The company will also close 15 of its roughly 75 offices.
The reorganization bears the stamp of Mr. Carroll, who came to Fluor as chief executive last July after serving as the president of the Shell Oil Company, the American arm of the Royal/Dutch Shell Group. Mr. Carroll, 61, who had reached Shell's retirement age of 60, replaced Lester G. McCraw, who resigned as Fluor's chief executive at the end of 1997 after being diagnosed with bladder cancer.
Under Mr. McCraw, Fluor, which is based in Irvine, south of Los Angeles, expanded into many different types of construction in an effort to boost its revenues.
"We would have poured your driveway if you wanted us to," James O. Rollans, the chief financial officer, said.
But much of the new business was not profitable. Mr. Carroll, aiming to double construction profit margins within five years, said Fluor would now focus on sectors in which it had a strong expertise and could command better profits, such as in petrochemicals and mining. It will phase out construction of office buildings, paper mills and other low-margin activities.
The company will also reorganize into four units, each with profit-and-loss responsibility. They are Fluor Daniel, the construction division;A. T. Massey, the coal producer; Fluor Global Services, which combines businesses such as equipment leasing and temporary staffing that the company sees as fast growing, and Shared Services, which will sell computing and administrative services to the other divisions.
Alan L. Boeckmann was promoted to head the construction division, which accounted for the bulk of revenues and about 40 percent of profits last year. That puts him in contention to succeed Mr. Carroll, who is expected to stay for several more years. Another contender is John Hopkins, who was named today to head a new global business development, sales and marketing group.
Fluor bucked the recent corporate trend of divesting noncore businesses by deciding to keep the coal division, which historically has been a strong performer. Mr. Carroll said there was some synergy between coal and construction, but that Fluor would continue to evaluate whether selling the coal business made sense.
One person close to the company said Fluor believed Massey, still financially strong, would be able to acquire some weaker rivals during the current hard times. That would make it more valuable if it were spun off in future years.

HEADLINE: END OF AN EMPIRE: THE HISTORY;
Writing the Last Chapter of 'Barbarians at the Gate'

BYLINE: By BARNABY J. FEDER 

 BODY:
Yesterday's move by the RJR Nabisco Holdings Corporation to break up and spin off its tobacco business is a nonevent for consumers. Oreo cookies, Life Savers candies and Planters peanuts will continue to roll off Nabisco's production lines and Camel and Winston cigarettes will come out of the R. J. Reynolds tobacco factories.
But the news is fascinating for Wall Street and business historians. 
 RJR Nabisco was born in 1985 when R. J. Reynolds Industries bought Nabisco Brands Inc. for $4.9 billion, one of many giant diversification moves by American companies in the 1970's and 1980's that have failed to reward shareholders.
"I see this as the undoing of another dumb merger," said Thomas Lys, a merger and acquisitions specialist at Northwestern University's Kellogg School of Management.
But RJR's story included an unusual response to Wall Street's distaste for the Nabisco merger. RJR followed the lead of hundreds of smaller companies that had been put in private hands during the 1980's by groups of financiers and insiders who borrowed vast sums of money to buy out shareholders of publicly traded enterprises. The leveraged buyout strategy hinged on selling pieces of the company to reduce the debt piled up in buying it, rapidly streamlining the rest and then selling shares back to the public at prices that produced huge profits for the buyout investors.
By October 1988, when F. Ross Johnson, RJR's brash and high-living chairman and chief executive, joined with investment bankers from Shearson Lehman Hutton to propose a $75-a-share buyout, the leverage strategy was already controversial for its disruptive effect on employees. The ensuing soap opera of greed and clashing egos, recapped in the best-selling "Barbarians at the Gate," ended in a $109-a-share, $25 billion buyout organized by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Company.
It also left Mr. Johnson's successors saddled with nearly $19 billion in debt, most of it junk bonds paying punishing interest rates. It is not clear whether RJR could have dug out from such burdens and prospered if everything had gone perfectly in the decade that followed, but it did not.
The 1990's were marred by marketing missteps, including goading Philip Morris into a cigarette price war, management strife and recessions in key overseas markets. The company's financial straitjacket and limited strategic options made it impossible to hang on to high profile executives like Louis V. Gerstner Jr. and Charles M. Harper, whom Kohlberg Kravis had recruited to lead the turnaround. And hanging over everything was increasingly expensive and uncertain tobacco litigation.
When Steven F. Goldstone became chairman and chief executive in 1996, he said that the company was in better shape than other companies with shares trading at such a low multiple to earnings but that he still had "to demonstrate we're through punishing shareholders."
Yesterday's change in course was a final concession that RJR never quite managed to do that and was unlikely to in its present form, inherited from the 1980's.

Chinese Raise Interest Rates on Dollar Deposits

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: BEIJING, March 9

 BODY:
China raised interest rates today on United States dollar deposits in an effort to stem a flow of hard currency out of the country that has come as international banks cut credit lines to Chinese borrowers.
The Bank of China, acting on orders of the central bank, raised the rate on one-year dollar deposits in Beijing to 4.66 percent from 3.75 percent. It also increased one-year rates for deposits denominated in the Hong Kong dollar -- which is linked to the American currency -- to 5.25 percent from 5 percent. 
 The rate increases "will encourage repatriation of hard-currency earnings by Chinese exporters," said Fred Hu, executive director of Asian Economic Research at Goldman, Sachs in Hong Kong. He called the increase a "correction" that brought Chinese bank rates more in line with international rates.
Other Chinese banks typically follow the lead of the Bank of China, a large commercial bank here. The new rates will vary among Chinese cities and banks.
Despite the higher rates paid on deposits of dollars, local currency rates "still have room to go lower," Mr. Hu said.
Seeking to rekindle economic growth, and to lower the interest payments that state-owned companies must make, China has cut interest rates paid on deposits of the local currency, the yuan, five times since November 1996. The economy is projected to grow 7 percent this year; although that is much faster than the growth expected in other Asian countries, it would be the slowest expansion in China since 1990.
Chinese banks currently pay 3.78 percent on one-year yuan deposits.
In 1997, China's foreign-exchange reserves rose by an average of $3 billion a month. But last year, despite increases in the trade surplus and in foreign investment, exchange reserves rose about $400 million a month.
The concern over currency reserves comes as foreign banks have instituted a near-freeze on new loans to Chinese companies. The foreign banks curtailed lending after the collapse in October of the nation's second-biggest trust company. Many of them are also demanding early repayment of loans to minimize further losses if more Chinese companies fail, bankers say.
Still, the $5 billion gain in reserves last year brought China's total to $144.96 billion at the end of 1998, second only to Japan's.
Today's interest-rate increase will narrow the gap between Chinese and foreign rates. The Bank of China's rate of 4.66 percent for one-year dollar deposits in Beijing is below the average of 5.23 percent offered by banks in the United States. The 5.25 percent rate offered for Hong Kong dollars is still below the 7 percent that Hong Kong banks are paying in Hong Kong.
Still, the increases may prove to be an incentive for Chinese exporters to repatriate some of their foreign funds. Exporters are permitted to retain 15 percent of their foreign-currency earnings, much of which is believed to remain outside China.

HEADLINE: Small Liberal Arts Colleges Facing Questions on Focus

BYLINE: By WILLIAM H. HONAN 

 BODY:
Endowments are up, and so are applications. At the nation's 550 small private liberal arts colleges, times have seemingly never been better. So why do many educators fear for their future?
In the winter issue of Daedalus, the quarterly journal of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, to be mailed to subscribers this week, several scholars warn that these institutions face a serious quandary in the next few years. 
 One, Eva T. H. Brann, a former dean at St. John's College in Annapolis, Md., goes so far as to call these institutions "an endangered species." And Paul Neely, a trustee of Williams College who is publisher of The Chattanooga Times, writes that "there may simply be more pure liberal arts colleges than we need."
About half a dozen small private residential colleges close their doors every year, and many others survive only by merging with larger institutions. Furthermore, the number of accepted students who eventually enroll -- a critical percentage that educators call "yield" -- is as low as 30 percent at even some of the most admired of these campuses, against well over 90 percent for the Ivy League institutions.
As a result, educators -- and not just those writing for Daedalus -- are posing a long-term question for the small liberal arts colleges: Should they shift their focus from a high-minded, education-for-its-own-sake approach to a more down-to-earth, job-oriented curriculum featuring programs in subjects like computer science, the global marketplace and accounting?
More than a few have already made the shift. "Pre-professional programs are a definite trend in our schools," said David Warren, president of the National Association of Independent Colleges and Universities, which represents most of the nation's small four-year residential liberal arts colleges.
But others warn that the shift to a heavily pre-professional curriculum will blur the distinction between the liberal arts colleges and their less expensive competitors -- publicly supported colleges and universities -- and thus weaken the private colleges by drawing students away.
At least two-thirds of the 550 colleges are almost unknown outside their local communities, while a few -- like Williams, Swarthmore, Haverford, Kenyon, Amherst and Wellesley -- are among the best-known names in American education.
Their principal selling point in the educational marketplace is that their diminutive size -- most have only 1,800 to 2,000 students -- permits faculty members to devote themselves to being teachers and mentors; research and publishing are preoccupations mainly at the big universities.
The claim is only partly valid, since small-college professors, like those at universities, are well aware that throughout academe, professional advancement is largely based on research and publishing and therefore are ignored at one's peril.
Furthermore, universities argue that good researchers are usually good teachers, and that students are energized by association with professors working at the cutting edge of their disciplines.
On the other hand, universities from Harvard on down assign small-section discussion leadership to teaching assistants (graduate students), a practice the small colleges generally avoid.
But small classes and one-on-one instruction are expensive -- maybe too expensive. Writing in Daedalus, Michael S. McPherson, the president of Macalester College in Minnesota, and Morton Owen Schapiro, a professor of economics at the University of Southern California, report that the almost explosive growth of public colleges and universities in recent decades has led to a steady shrinking of the small private college customer base that is "willing and able to cover the costs of the enterprise."
Mr. Neely, the Williams trustee who contributed to Daedalus, blames "vocationalism, credentialism or even dollarizing" on the part of students for the financial stress.
The small colleges most vulnerable to failure, he writes, are the handful in the lowest economic tier that "have not had the resources to develop an additional, career-oriented curriculum" that many students and their parents are now demanding.
But paradoxically, Mr. Neely writes, most of the several hundred small mid-level liberal arts colleges that have been able to provide specialized, career-oriented training have done so at the expense of low tuition, small classes, close faculty-to-student relationships, competitive faculty salaries and painstaking campus maintenance -- characteristics that have traditionally distinguished these colleges from public ones.
Even the small private colleges with national prominence are in jeopardy, Mr. Neely warns, unless they can present themselves as alternatives to a culture that chooses "trends over permanence, image over substance, money over values, and the market over meaning."
In agreement with Mr. Neely, Richard H. Hersh, president of Hobart and William Smith Colleges in Geneva, N.Y., warns against "Mc Universities -- learning malls catering to the whims of their customers," and urges his liberal arts colleagues to provide students with "a coherent body of knowledge."
Whatever the dangers faced by the small private liberal arts colleges, most educators who have studied them conclude that their special contribution to higher education is inextricably related to their size.
In a personal essay in Daedalus, Geoffrey Canada, president and chief executive of the Rheedlen Center for Children and Families, told how he as an African-American student was transformed in the 1970's by four years at the almost all-white Bowdoin College in Brunswick, Me.
"There is something about the smallness of Bowdoin that brought about an intimacy that I will never forget," Mr. Canada wrote.
"A student who left school because of poor academic performance, although a rare occurrence, was felt to be a real loss," he continued. "The faculty seemed to feel the same way."

HEADLINE: Support Is Pledged for Republican Budget

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 9

 BODY:
Republicans pledged support today for the budget outline worked out last week by their leaders but acknowledged that turning the plan into legislation would be fraught with political risks and difficulties.
After separate briefings on the plan, House and Senate Republicans said they expected to adopt a tax and spending guideline in the next several weeks that would set aside all money generated by the Social Security system, increase spending for the military and education, cut taxes and remain within the tight spending limits in current budget law. 
 Eager to present a united front as they head into another season of battles with the Clinton Administration over fiscal priorities, Republicans said they were willing to put aside their long-running internal divisions and to suspend for now their doubts about the plan's political viability.
Republicans appear to have resigned themselves to limiting the size of their proposed tax cut for next year to a much smaller level than they had initially envisioned. But several influential Republicans said the party would ultimately have to confront the hard choices their plan would force on them, most notably its requirement for deep cuts in domestic programs outside the Pentagon and education to remain within the spending caps.
Senator Ted Stevens, the Alaska Republican who heads the Senate Appropriations Committee, said there was little will in the Senate for cuts in nonmilitary spending but a strong desire for an increase in Pentagon spending. As a result, Mr. Stevens said, the appropriations committees, which draw up the bills that finance specific programs, would inevitably come under heavy pressure to break the spending caps.
"I can live with them," he said, referring to the caps. "But I'm not sure Congress can take the actions necessary to live within them."
Mr. Stevens and other Republicans said they wanted to avoid a replay of last year, when Congress and the Administration agreed on a spending plan during a flurry of last-minute negotiations that got around the spending limits by designating $20 billion in expenditures as "emergencies" that are not subject to normal budget rules.
Senator Don Nickles of Oklahoma, the Republican whip, said: "To stay within the caps will require fiscal discipline. We broke that discipline last year."
The Republican plan, which has been endorsed by the party's leaders in both the House and the Senate, is an effort to claim the high ground in this year's budget battle by promising to go further than President Clinton in saving projected Federal budget surpluses for Social Security and preserving fiscal discipline.
The plan will be the basis for the budget resolution, a nonbinding measure that guides the appropriations and tax-writing committees in both chambers. Because it is not legislation, the budget resolution cannot be vetoed by the President, although White House officials have already attacked the plan for requiring deep cuts in domestic spending and for not earmarking part of the projected budget surplus to shore up Medicare.
Budget politics this year are particularly complicated, in part because they are caught up in the related question of how to shore up Social Security and in part because of the eagerness in both parties to position themselves for the 2000 elections.
But if the ideological divide between Republicans and Democrats appears especially deep this year, the size of the projected budget surpluses could provide a useful bridge. This is because the strength of the economy seems likely to make the surplus even bigger than projected for the next year or two. Members of both parties said the prospects for a compromise improved with each increase in the pool of money available to them, in much the same way that the 1997 bipartisan budget agreement was built on the improving fiscal outlook.
The potential for a larger-than-expected surplus is already playing into Republican plans. Representative John R. Kasich, the Ohio Republican who heads the House Budget Committee, told House Republicans today that he expected next year's tax cut to be $10 billion to $15 billion.
But Mr. Kasich later told reporters that if the Congressional Budget Office increased its estimate of next year's surplus in coming months, the size of the tax cut could expand. Senator Trent Lott of Mississippi, the majority leader, said the tax cut next year could be as much as $25 billion, and would grow rapidly in subsequent years as the non-Social Security budget surplus increased.
The budget wrangling also continued to ensnare a $1.9 billion supplemental spending bill that includes disaster relief aid for Central American countries hit by Hurricane Mitch. The White House has proposed paying for the spending by dipping into this year's surplus, all of which comes from Social Security. But Republicans insisted again today that the aid be paid for by offsetting spending cuts in programs including welfare and food stamps, a condition the White House has rejected.

HEADLINE: John Atwood, Aviation Executive, Dies at 94

BYLINE: By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON 

 BODY:
John Leland Atwood, an engineer who rose through the executive ranks at North American Aviation as it built the P-51 Mustang, the most powerful fighter plane of World War II; the F-100 Super Sabre, the first supersonic fighter, and the Apollo capsule that took men to the moon, died on March 5. He was 94 and lived in Los Angeles.
Mr. Atwood, who was known as Lee, retired in 1970 as chairman of the North American Rockwell Corporation, a company formed three years earlier by the merger of North American Aviation Inc. of Los Angeles and the Rockwell-Standard Corporation, an auto parts maker in Pittsburgh. The company became Rockwell International in 1973. 
 Don H. Davis, the chief executive of Rockwell International, said Mr. Atwood's contributions "helped the United States to attain aerospace superiority."
Mr. Atwood was assistant general manager of North American Aviation in 1940 when he persuaded the British Government to pay for development of a new plane instead of modifying the Curtiss P-40. Pilots flying the new plane, the P-51 Mustang, were responsible for almost half of the enemy aircraft downed in Europe.
Luther Smith of Villanova, Pa., one of the Tuskegee Airmen, a unit of black fighter pilots, flew 50 of his 133 World War II combat missions in a P-51. He said yesterday that the Mustang "could outmaneuver all of the German fighters."
"The P-51 was so powerful, with its Rolls-Royce engines, and so maneuverable, that we would give Germans 10 seconds to parachute out once we got behind them," he added. "They knew, and we knew, that we had them and we would have our gun cameras on, and as soon as we got a picture of them bailing out we would shoot down the plane and let the pilot live."
Mr. Atwood also played a key role in designing the B-25 Mitchell, a medium-range bomber, 16 of which were used by Gen. Jimmy Doolittle in the raid over Tokyo in 1942, an attack that had little military value but helped raise American morale.
In 1953, Mr. Atwood disclosed that the F-100, which his company built, had become the first production jet fighter to operate at supersonic speeds in level flight. He also helped North American Aviation win the contract to build the X-15 rocket plane, which Capt. Pete Knight flew at more than 4,500 miles an hour in 1967.
Mr. Atwood was born in 1904 in Walton, Ky. He graduated from Hardin-Simmons University in 1926 and two years later earned a master's degree in civil engineering at the University of Texas. He then went to work as a junior airplane engineer for the Army Air Corps at Wright Field in Dayton, Ohio.
In 1930, he was hired at Douglas Aircraft in Santa Monica, Calif., and in 1934 he moved to North American Aviation in Los Angeles as chief engineer and vice president. He was promoted to assistant general manager in 1938, to first vice president in 1941, to president in 1948, chief executive in 1960 and chairman in 1962.
Five years later, when the company merged with Rockwell-Standard, Mr. Atwood was named chief executive, a post he held until he retired in 1970. In 1996, Boeing acquired the aerospace operations of Rockwell International.
Mr. Atwood is survived by his wife, Patricia, Rockwell International said.
For many years after World War II, North American Aviation was the biggest military contractor, relying on Washington for virtually all of its revenue. Mr. Atwood was called to Washington several times for hearings by Congressmen about how well the company spent taxpayer money, as well as its relationship with Robert G. Baker, the Senate Democratic secretary whose outside business dealings were the subject of a 1964 Congressional inquiry.
In 1962, North American Aviation abruptly reduced by half its contract with a vending machine company to make room for another company, U-Serv, in which Mr. Baker was a major shareholder. The deal was valued at $2.5 million, the equivalent of $13.6 million today. Mr. Atwood told the Senate Rules Committee in 1964 that he was unaware of Mr. Baker's role or that his company's lobbyist was also a major U-Serv shareholder. Ten days later, Mr. Atwood announced that he had dismissed the lobbyist.
In 1967, Mr. Atwood was again called on the carpet after a fire killed three Apollo astronauts during a pre-flight test of the space capsule. Mr. Atwood said that in designing the capsule no one had considered the possibility of a fire on the ground.
The Government's own inquiry found shoddy work that was not caught by inspectors of North American Aviation, including a socket wrench left inside the Apollo capsule. The moon project was not only a huge political issue but also an economic giant that accounted for almost 1 percent of the gross national product at its peak.
Mr. Atwood told a House committee that "overconfidence" was behind some of the problems, which he vowed to correct without delaying the national goal to put a man on the moon before the end of the decade. He installed new managers on the project and made other changes. On July 20, 1969, Neil A. Armstrong put his boot into lunar dust and later that year the National Aeronautics and Space Administration gave Mr. Atwood its Public Service Award.

HEADLINE: Eric R. Wolf, 76, an Iconoclastic Anthropologist

BYLINE: By ROBERT McG. THOMAS Jr. 

 BODY:
Eric R. Wolf, an accidental anthropologist whose cultural studies of Latin American peoples and European peasants helped enrich an already eclectic field even as he challenged some established cultural assumptions, died on Sunday at his home in Irvington, N.Y. He was 76 and had taught at Lehman College and the Graduate Center of the City University of New York.
The cause was liver cancer, his family said. 
 For someone who had had an intense fascination with the sometimes striking cultural differences of diverse peoples since his grade school days in polyglot Vienna and his teen-age years in strife-torn Sudetenland, Dr. Wolf -- whose father was Austrian and mother Russian -- did not immediately see anthropology as his natural academic outlet.
Even after he came to the United States with his parents and settled in Jackson Heights, Queens, Dr. Wolf, whose father had operated a textile factory in the Sudetenland before the 1938 Nazi takeover, saw biology as the best bet to explain human differences.
But after enrolling in Queens College planning to major in biochemistry, he stumbled into an anthropology class one day and realized that the broad field embraced just about everything he was interested in, which was just about everything about every aspect of the human experience.
After interrupting his education to serve with the Army in the Alps in World War II, Dr. Wolf received a degree in anthropology in 1946 and went on to Columbia University on the G.I. bill, receiving a doctorate in 1951.
Before joining City University in 1971 as a distinguished professor, he had brief teaching stints at the University of Illinois, the University of Virginia, Yale University and the University of Chicago and nine years as a professor at the University of Michigan.
By then he had already established his reputation as an innovative and iconoclastic academic, whose credentials included helping to organize one of the earliest Vietnam teach-ins, at Michigan in 1965.
His 1959 book about Mexico, for example, "Sons of the Shaking Earth," raised eyebrows among established anthropologists -- even as it established a fertile trend -- by drawing on archaeology, history and other alien fields to trace the diverse cultural development of Mexico. It is a reflection of the book's power, as well as of Dr. Wolf's clear and graceful writing style, that it is still used in introductory anthropology courses.
In writing the book, Dr. Wolf not only made unorthodox use of scholarship from other fields but also refined some of his own unorthodox ideas about the very nature of culture. Long seen by anthropologists as a stable set of attitudes and practices that defined various peoples and differentiated them from others, culture, as Dr. Wolf came to see it, was a far more dynamic process that involved endless practical, psychological and other reactions to changing economic and other conditions.
To Dr. Wolf, who outlined his position in a 1964 book, "Anthropology," the notion of unified and unchanging cultures amounted to little more than misleading ethnic stereotyping, sweeping generalizations that failed to notice or account for the variety of differences within a single culture.
Having concluded that established cultural anthropologists tended to neglect many nonconforming elements of a given society, Dr. Wolf helped rectify things with his 1966 book, "Peasants," which traced the common threads of peasantry in otherwise diverse European cultures.
In 1982 he developed another favorite theme, the sometimes cataclysmic impact of colonial capitalism on indigenous cultures, with "Europe and the People Without History," which tracked the impact of colonial economic expansion on less developed societies.
If Dr. Wolf was a champion of the idea that all people, even tribal societies and peasants, are equally important, he also practiced that philosophy in his life as a teacher or, as he saw himself, as a perpetual student for whom life was an endless and delightful field trip.
A brilliant man known for his charming and uncanny ability to make even ordinary people feel he was intensely interested in them, as indeed he was, Dr. Wolf was such a nurturing teacher that he was the preferred go-to guy when his students came up with brilliant but untested ideas. While other professors, they knew, might dismiss such brainstorms as harebrained, Dr. Wolf could be counted on to become as excited as they were.
Even after his retirement in 1992, Dr. Wolf, who was awarded a $375,000 MacArthur Foundation "genius grant" in 1990, continued his quest for new answers to old questions, among them the explanation for the Nazis' rise to power.
Finding parallels between the rise of Nazi Germany and both the widespread human sacrifice by the Aztecs and the development of a frenzied tradition of Potlatch feasts in the Pacific Northwest, Dr. Wolf examined them in his last book, "Envisioning Power: Ideologies of Dominance and Crisis," published this year by the University of California Press.
Dr. Wolf, whose first marriage ended in divorce, is survived by his wife, Sydel Silverman; two sons from his first marriage, David, of Burlington, Vt., and Daniel, of Los Angeles; two stepdaughters, Eve Silverman of Wilton, Conn., and Julie Yorn of Santa Monica, Calif., and three grandchildren.

HEADLINE: END OF AN EMPIRE: THE OVERVIEW;
RJR NABISCO SPLITS TOBACCO VENTURES AND FOOD BUSINESS

BYLINE: By CONSTANCE L. HAYS 

 BODY:
Burdened by debt and the persistent threat of fresh lawsuits over smoking, RJR Nabisco announced yesterday that it was splitting its food and tobacco businesses and selling its foreign tobacco company to a Japanese buyer.
The moves will effectively remove RJR Nabisco from the tobacco business, while the money from the sale will reduce its debt. The actions will also unravel one of the biggest mergers and most fought-over leveraged buyouts of the 1980's, a battle that became a symbol of the decade's excesses. 
 The original merger between R.J. Reynolds and Nabisco in 1985 was intended to enhance the tobacco company's increasingly negative image. Then in 1988, eager to raise the company's share price, RJR Nabisco's management announced a plan to take the company private for $17 billion. That move attracted other would-be owners, including the Kohlberg Kravis Roberts investment firm, which ultimately bid the price up to $30 billion.
The deal was financed at high interest rates, leaving the company with a mountain of debt. The battle for the company and the huge fees it generated for investment bankers inspired a best seller, "Barbarians at the Gate," which became a television movie. In early 1991, Kohlberg Kravis sold stock in the company back to the public.
With the changes announced yesterday, Steven F. Goldstone, the chairman and chief executive of RJR Nabisco, acknowledged that mixing the maker of Oreos and Nilla Wafers with the maker of Winston cigarettes had not worked out.
"There's no reason for these businesses to be under the same roof," he said. "They are very different enterprises, with different problems, different challenges and different investor groups."
People should have "the opportunity to choose whether they want to invest in a tobacco company or a food company," he added, acknowledging the "tobacco taint" that many analysts say has hampered the stock performances of Philip Morris and RJR Nabisco.
Domestic tobacco will become a separate company, which will be responsible for any smoking-related claims in the United States. The holding company will continue to own the food business and could be liable for claims if the domestic tobacco company were to go bankrupt.
The international tobacco division, perennially smaller and weaker than its rivals, is being sold to Japan Tobacco, which is controlled by the Government, for $8 billion, considered a hefty price by even the most optimistic stock analysts.
The efforts are intended to perk up a chronically depressed stock price. Wall Street responded cautiously, sending RJR's share price up a mere 75 cents, to close at $29.375, although it initially rose nearly $2 after the announcement.
Shares in Philip Morris also rose slightly, by 62.5 cents, with some investors betting it would separate its tobacco and food operations as well. A spokesman said Philip Morris had decided against that option in 1994 and had not changed its mind.
RJR's foreign sale, which is expected to be completed by mid-May, will shore up the domestic tobacco company, which will be known as R. J. Reynolds Tobacco.
Most of the $5 billion in after-tax proceeds will be used to pay down that company's debt, now about $6 billion, said Marc Cohen, who follows tobacco companies for Goldman, Sachs. "It will then have a very conservatively managed and strong financial position," he said, calling the spinoff "a very bold move."
Current shareholders of RJR Nabisco will receive one share of the tobacco company for each share they own, in a transaction that will be tax free to them and the company.
RJR Nabisco will remain a holding company, with its sole asset the 80.6 percent of Nabisco that it now owns. Since it will no longer own any part of the tobacco company, it will be renamed Nabisco Group Holdings. Most of the 90 or so employees at its headquarters in New York will be laid off.
Plaintiffs in smoking lawsuits would be able to sue the holding company, several experts said yesterday, should the tobacco company be unable to meet its obligations. But with a reduced debt load, the free-standing tobacco company will be in a stronger financial position.
John Coale, a lawyer in Washington, who is involved in lawsuits against R. J. Reynolds, said he did not foresee the new corporate structure interfering with his cases.
"For all past conduct and present litigation, they are not off the hook," he said. "We would try to put Humpty Dumpty together again and then we would collect."
How much potential liability the holding company faces will be reflected in the stock price. RJR Nabisco now holds 80.6 percent of Nabisco's shares, and the remainder is held by the public.
While the food operation's shares were trading at $45 yesterday, the stock price of RJR Nabisco was less than $30. When the tobacco companies are spun off and sold, Mr. Cohen predicted, shares in RJR should rise closer to $45.
Carl C. Icahn, the corporate takeover specialist who has repeatedly bought and sold big stakes in RJR, re-entered the picture this winter and threatened to nominate his own board by this Friday if the company did not spin off the food unit. Pressure from Mr. Icahn was not a motivating factor, Mr. Goldstone said. "It would be Carl's third attempt up the wall," he said.
Once the lawsuits brought by the attorneys general of dozens of states were resolved last year in a $206 billion industrywide settlement, Mr. Goldstone said his priority became "finding a home" for the international tobacco business.
"We wanted to find a value for our shareholders that was high enough to fix the balance sheet of our tobacco business," he said.
Japan Tobacco agreed to pay a 33 percent premium for the international tobacco division, which had been valued at about $6 billion. Japan Tobacco's chief long-term strategist, Yasushi Shingai, said in an interview that he did not feel the price was too high. "These are very strong and prestigious brands, and there is a lot of potential to grow," he said.
With the deal, Japan Tobacco will vault from fifth place to third in the global cigarette business and gain a presence in Western Europe and Russia. Its revenue last year was $27.2 billion, and it is also involved in pharmaceuticals and food. In addition, it controls Japan's largest vending-machine company, a key asset in a country where many products are sold that way.
Formed in 1985 after privatization, Japan Tobacco owns Japan's biggest-selling cigarette brand, Mild Seven, and makes Marlboro cigarettes locally for Philip Morris.
Asked whether his company was concerned about liability from smokers' lawsuits, Mr. Shingai replied, "We have three pending litigations, but the law system and the culture are very different than in the U.S."
There was some speculation yesterday about a possible sequel to the story, particularly if Nabisco becomes a takeover target again. "Somebody like Philip Morris may find them appetizing," said Gary M. Black, who tracks tobacco stocks for Sanford C. Bernstein & Company.

HEADLINE: 20 Journalists, Including 2 Times Writers, Win Polk Awards

BYLINE: By ANDREW JACOBS 

 BODY:
Twenty journalists whose work documented corporate deceit, political impropriety and ethnic bloodletting have been chosen as recipients of the 1998 George Polk Awards, the awards' sponsor announced yesterday.
Among the winners this year are two writers for The New York Times. Russell Baker, who for 36 years wrote the "Observer" column in The Times, won the George Polk Career Award. It was the second Polk Award for Mr. Baker, who retired last year. He won the prize for commentary in 1978. 
 Clifford J. Levy, the Albany bureau chief of The Times, won the local reporting award for his exploration of political fund-raising in the state government. His scrutiny of candidates' donor lists exposed conflicts of interest and led to continuing criminal investigations.
This year is the 50th anniversary of the awards, which were established in memory of George W. Polk, a CBS correspondent who was killed in 1948 while covering the civil war in Greece. The awards, which are administered by Long Island University, will be presented April 14 at the Roosevelt Hotel in Manhattan.
Other winners this year included Alix M. Freedman of The Wall Street Journal, who won the international reporting award for her investigation of efforts to sterilize women in the third world, often without their consent.
Juan Gonzalez, a columnist for The Daily News for more than two decades, won the commentary award for his writings on New York's poor and disenfranchised.
The award for foreign reporting went to Tracy Wilkinson of The Los Angeles Times, who wrote about the struggles between ethnic Albanian separatists and Serbian nationalists in Kosovo.
The other categories and winners are:
Economic Reporting -- Mary Jordan, Keith Richburg and Kevin Sullivan of The Washington Post, for their eight-part series illustrating the human toll of the Asian economic crisis.
National Reporting -- Donald L. Barlett and James B. Steele of Time magazine for their series on wasteful government subsidies to corporations.
Book -- Philip Gourevitch, for his account of genocide in "We Wish to Inform You That Tomorrow We Will Be Killed With Our Families: Stories From Rwanda" (Farrar, Straus & Giroux).
Environmental Reporting -- Gardiner Harris and R. G. Dunlop of The Louisville Courier-Journal for their investigation into how illegal practices among coal mine operators lead to the death each year of 1,500 workers from black lung disease.
Radio Reporting -- Amy Goodman and Jeremy Scahill, producers for Pacifica Radio's "Democracy Now" series, for their documentary on Chevron's role in the murder of two environmentalists in Nigeria.
Television Reporting -- Brian Ross and Rhonda Schwartz of the ABC News program "20/20" for a report on the labor practices of American clothing manufacturers in Saipan, a United States commonwealth where sweatshop conditions persist.
Medical Reporting -- Robert Whitaker and Dolores Kong of The Boston Globe for their series on how mentally ill people are harmed by federally financed drug trials.
Legal Reporting -- Joe Stephens of The Kansas City Star for a report that exposed widespread conflicts of interest among Federal judges.

N.C.A.A. Decision Creates Confusion

BYLINE: By JOE DRAPE with LENA WILLIAMS 

 BODY:
Now in his senior year at St. Patrick's High School in Elizabeth, N.J., Jamal Jackson has a 2.4 grade-point average in the classroom to go with his 11 points and 8 assists a game on the basketball court. He has received inquiries from Division I schools like St. Peter's and Fairfield, but in two attempts at the S.A.T, he has failed to make the National Collegiate Athletic Association minimum score of 820 required for an athletic scholarship.
Now he, as well as hundreds of high school athletes across the country, may not have to. On Monday, a Federal District Court judge in Philadelphia struck down the N.C.A.A.'s minimum test score requirement, or Proposition 16, saying that it discriminated against African-Americans. The ruling removed from the N.C.A.A.'s control the issue of college athletic eligibility, and for now placed it with the individual schools. It left college administrators and the N.C.A.A. in limbo yesterday, with many officials acknowledging that in the absence of guidelines, confusion would reign. 
 "It does present somewhat of a chaotic environment," said the N.C.A.A. president, Cedric Dempsey. "It leaves a lot of unanswered questions."
For Jackson and other students, the window of opportunity may be brief. The N.C.A.A. will ask Judge Ronald I. Buckwalter today for a stay of his decision, saying the chaos among its member schools would be counterproductive. In the mean time, it will prepare an appeal. Elsa Kircher Cole, the organization's general counsel, said she expected a response from the judge "within a day or two."
N.C.A.A. officials said they have been studying eligibility standards since last summer and are prepared to move quickly in establishing a new standard. Charles Wethington, the University of Kentucky president and chairman of the N.C.A.A. executive committee, said that coming up with an acceptable standard from more than four options has been difficult. He said the N.C.A.A. has not strayed from its goal of having initial eligibility standards in an effort to improve graduation rates and insure that student athletes are prepared for college work.
"We are greatly concerned at this moment with the effect this ruling will have on academic preparedness of prospective student athletes," Wethington said.
On a day when N.C.A.A. officials conceded they had more questions than answers, they also announced that the N.C.A.A. would pay $54.5 million to about 2,000 Division I coaches who had sued over the restricted earnings rule, which had capped their salaries at $16,000 for a calendar year. It is the settlement of a $75 million judgment against the N.C.A.A. in a case challenging its decision to limit the earnings of entry-level coaches.
But it was Buckwalter's ruling on one of college sports' most enduring challenges -- how to improve graduation rates without excluding economically disadvantaged students -- that left coaches, administrators and college presidents uncertain of who is eligible for scholarships. Without Proposition 16, there are no guidelines by which to decide if incoming freshmen are academically eligible.
It poses immediate problems in the N.C.A.A. basketball tournament, which begins tomorrow. The N.C.A.A. estimates that 500 to 1,000 athletes have been affected by the existing test score minimum requirement. Until a stay is granted, the N.C.A.A. said yesterday, athletes sitting out their freshman year because they failed to meet the minimum requirements are free to play -- including the Temple basketball player Alexander Wesby, who was one of the four plaintiffs in a class action suit in Philadelphia. He won't play in the tournament, said the Temple sports media director, Brian Kirschner.
Wethington said he wouldn't approve an ineligible player if the situation arises at his school. "I think this situation is too fluid, too undecided and there's too much at risk," Wethington said, emphasizing that he was speaking only for himself. "I think it would be sending the absolute wrong signal."
 The ruling touched on an issue that resonates among coaches and athletes. If it is upheld, the ruling could restore a lost year of eligibility to athletes like Rasheed Brokenborough, the Temple senior guard who sat out his freshman year because of the S.A.T. cutoff and ran up $15,000 in debt because he could not qualify for a scholarship.
"Everyone in coaching has been affected by the N.C.A.A. test rules," said Lute Olson, the Arizona coach. "There are a number of kids we would have recruited had they not had test scores standing in their way. This particular kid pops into my mind -- he is from southern California and he's playing in the pros now. He did not have high enough test scores in the initial period that we needed them to make the decision. We went with the kid with the test score. We would have opted for the southern California kid. Later, he got the test score at the end of the year. His first choice was us, but we couldn't wait and take the chance on him getting the score."
New York high school coaches, athletic directors and school administrators applauded the judge's ruling. Wade Williams, for 10 years the basketball coach at Bronx Regional, an alternative high school for students with academic problems, remembered the players who didn't meet the requirements.
"A lot of them were intimidated by the S.A.T. because they hadn't had academic success," said Williams, who has placed at least 40 athletes on scholarships at junior colleges or Division III schools.
But Williams, who is black, also worried that the ruling might have a damaging effect on those it aimed to help: black students.
"I'm very concerned that kids will think they don't have to do anything," Williams said. "It also exposes kids to unscrupulous coaches who will accept them for their talent, then cast them aside."
That situation , with embarrassing admissions by college students that they were not being educated or even had trouble reading, was what prompted the N.C.A.A. to institute minimum test scores in the first place back in the mid-1980's.
For St. Patrick's Jackson, a change in the requirements for athletic eligibility would bring an opportunity to be rewarded for the hard work he has done in the classroom. He is the second oldest of five children and would be the first in his family to attend college.
"I hope the judge's rule stands because I'd get a lot more offers," Jackson said yesterday by telephone as his team prepared for the state sectional tournament. "Right now, schools are scared to take me because of my S.A.T. scores. They're afraid they may have to park me on the bench."
His coach, Kevin Boyle, said Jackson has steadily raised his grade-point average over his four years. "He came in not as a great student," said Boyle. "But he stayed on the straight and narrow, worked hard and we made sure he didn't slip through the cracks. He's really tried to improve his S.A.T. scores, but he doesn't test well on big tests. This is a kid that deserves a break."

HEADLINE: Crime Is Falling, but Drug War Hurts Families

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Re "Less Crime, More Criminals" (Week in Review, March 7): Crime is down, yet the incarceration of nonviolent drug offenders is growing at an enormous rate. We need to study new methods of treating drug offenders and to stop the growth of new prisons. The United States has the largest penal system in the world -- soon to reach two million inmates -- and as you report, 400,000 are now behind bars for drug crimes. The problem is that incarceration will not suffice as a means of rehabilitation for drug offenders. 
 Neither the economic health of businesses like the Corrections Corporation of America nor the political rhetoric of politicians should be a basis for the prison buildup. The building of new prisons does not remedy the drug war; it perpetuates it.

LaChance Gets Lost In Shuffle

BYLINE: By TARIK EL-BASHIR 

 BODY:

ISLANDERS 2, FLYERS 2
 The fire sale, it seems, has begun.
 During the first period of last night's 2-2 tie with the Philadelphia Flyers at Nassau Coliseum in Uniondale, N.Y., the Islanders traded defenseman Scott Lachance to the Montreal Canadiens for a third-round draft pick, as the team, with virtually no shot at the playoffs, cuts its payroll.
 More moves could be coming soon. Trevor Linden, the Islanders' captain, has reportedly drawn inquires from Detroit, Dallas, Ottawa, Toronto and Vancouver, and the center is likely to be traded before the March 23 trade deadline. Linden will make $2.5 million this season. 
 "The reason is kind of simple," Islanders General Manager Mike Milbury said of the Lachance trade. "There were some economic reasons involved. When you get down to the fifth or sixth spot, you have to be careful of what you're spending."
 Lachance, who has one goal, eight assists and a plus-minus rating of minus 19, had a salary of $1.1 million this season. Milbury said the Islanders were not willing to make Lachance a qualifying offer of $1.25 million for next season, so they got what they could for him.
 The fourth pick over all in 1991, Lachance never fulfilled the high expectations on Long Island, his stock plummeting this season. But a third-round pick?
 "I'm a little confused and shocked," said the 26-year-old defenseman, who was sometimes booed by the home crowd this year. "You wonder about a lot of things.
 "There have been a lot of moves over the years where I don't know if we got equal value back. I'm not going to say anything negative about the G.M. or the owners. But a third-rounder won't help this team for three or four years. I know the guys are thinking about that. I hope this isn't an indication of what is going to happen, for the fans and for the players."
 The trade leaves Rich Pilon as the lone Islander remaining from the team's previous playoff appearance in 1994, and he is also rumored to be on the trading block.
 "People say there is going to be a fire sale," Pilon said. "I don't think about it. It's out of my control."
 In last night's game, the Isles' second tie with the Flyers in four days, Dmitri Tertyshny and Daymond Langkow scored for Philadelphia as John Vanbiesbrouck made 20 saves in the Flyers' net. Scoring for the Islanders were Zigmund Palffy and Mark Lawrence; Tommy Salo made 33 stops. TARIK EL-BASHIR
 
BRUINS 2, PANTHERS 0
 Ray Bourque had a goal and an assist and Byron Dafoe made 19 saves for his seventh shutout of the season as host Boston beat Florida.
 The victory gave the Bruins a 2-point advantage over the Rangers in their fight for the eighth and final playoff spot in the N.H.L.'s Eastern Conference. They meet Friday at Madison Square Garden.
 Dafoe's stops included a glove save on Bret Hedican from the slot at 4:14 of the third period and a blocker save from the left of the crease by Robert Svehla five minutes later.
 Bourque, playing in his 1,435th game as a Bruin -- one shy of the team record held by John Bucyk -- scored a power-play goal at 9:45 of the second period to give Boston a 1-0 lead.
 The 150th power-play goal of his career came on a shot from the point.
 Jason Allison's 19th goal boosted the Bruins' lead to 2-0.
 
AVALANCHE 3, CAPITALS 2
 Sandis Ozolinsh scored 19 seconds into overtime as Colorado, winning for the second straight time without three of its top stars, dampened Washington's playoff hopes.
 Ozolinsh, with space in the left circle, took a pass from Valery Kamensky and beat goaltender Olaf Kolzig over the left shoulder.
 It was Ozolinsh's third goal of the season.
 
FLAMES 7, BLUES 4
 Rene Corbet scored twice as visiting Calgary overcame a two-goal deficit.
 Jerome Iginla and Corbet each scored to tie the game.
 Andrei Nazarov, Steve Dubinsky and Valery Bure also scored for Calgary.
 
MAPLE LEAFS 6, LIGHTNING 1
 Sergei Berezin made his 200th N.H.L. game a memorable one with two goals as host Toronto beat Tampa Bay.
 Mats Sundin had a goal and two assists, Tie Domi had a goal and an assist and while Mike Johnson and Lonny Bohonos also scored for Toronto. Robert Petrovicky scored for the Lightning.
 Curtis Joseph stopped 40 shots in the Toronto net.
 It was the second straight drubbing for the Lightning, which lost by 9-3 to Ottawa on Monday.
 Bill Ranford started in the Tampa Bay goal, but only lasted one period after giving up four goals on 18 shots. Corey Schwab, who let in the Senators' first seven goals, fared a little better, stopping 20 of 22 shots.
 Sundin burned Tampa Bay with three goals and 7 points in four games as the Maple Leafs swept the season series.
 The Maple Leafs got lucky when both Sundin's goal and Berezin's second were tipped in by Lightning defenders. Although he was given a 6-0 lead, Joseph stopped all 16 shots Tampa Bay fired at him in the first period and robbed Stephane Richer on two breakaways.
 Berezin had a strong night with four shots after two periods, including a few blistering off-wing rushes.
 The 27-year-old Russian, who has 67 career goals, leads the team with 26 goals.
 
REFEREES
 Satisfied with the way the format worked in selected games during the regular season, the N.H.L. will use two referees in all Stanley Cup playoff games this season,
 Colin Campbell, the N.H.L. senior vice president, said club executives were "overwhelmingly in support" of the two-referee system for the playoffs. (AP)

HEADLINE: ARCHITECTURE FOR A NEW CENTURY;
Fierce Poetry From Young Turks

BYLINE: By JULIE V. IOVINE

 BODY:
WENDELL BURNETTE'S first building, a house for himself at the edge of the Sonoran desert, has graced the covers of numerous international magazines. The British magazine Architectural Review proclaimed him "one to watch in 1998" and Metropolitan Home recently named him one of "21 Rising Stars for the 21st Century." A 36-year-old architect from Phoenix, he has arrived.
Or has he? The only job his office has right now is a small remodeling project; he can't remember when he last paid himself and can barely maintain a payroll for his one trusty employee. "The irony is that there are all these accolades," Mr. Burnette said on a cell phone last week as he drove to a potential project site at 7 A.M., "and at the same time, I'm wondering where the next meal is coming from." 
 And in Berkeley, Calif., Ralph Nelson and Raveevarn Choksombatchal, both 37, who were married in 1989, have shared an architectural practice called Loom for six years. Their combined curriculum vitae is 12 pages long, but it wasn't until they received a Progressive Architecture award last year that people began returning their calls.
"We've spent 10 years becoming an overnight success," Mr. Nelson said, adding that teaching stints kept the firm afloat. "Savings? What's that?"
Mr. Burnette's practice and Loom are among eight architecture firms selected as "Emerging Voices" of 1999 by the Architectural League of New York, a nonprofit organization that has sponsored public programs in architecture since 1881. But rising stars need more than a winning way with a T-square -- or a CAD program -- to make a name for themselves. The simplest projects require a fanatical commitment and Job-like patience. For those struggling to distinguish themselves, "the will to be independent overrides all sensible decisions" about life and gainful employment, Mr. Nelson said, gamely.
The League's winners offer a telling glimpse of the state of architecture -- a mirror of the built world of today and a window onto the next century. Drawing inspiration from sources as unexpected as the extreme shapes assumed by materials distorted by stress, or as poetic as the play of light in a Cartier-Bresson photograph, these eight firms, for all their travails, are shaping the future in ways that are strikingly individual but also surprisingly in synch.
Just about every significant architect who came of age in the last two decades, including Steven Holl, Tod Williams and Billie Tsien, Deborah Berke, and Henry Smith-Miller and Laurie Hawkinson has been an Emerging Voice.
Recalling the year he was selected (1982), Steven Holl, who comes from Seattle, said: "Here I was, an architect basically coming out of the woods to New York. And they chose me. It gave me hope."
"Emerging Voices is incredibly important, and not for crass reasons of career advancement," he continued, "because it acknowledges and respects the ideas swirling around in the heads of young architects."
An interest in the physical world, with all its warts and wonders, distinguishes one group of winners. Call them the New Sensualists: they're less interested in the eye-catching photogenic image of a building, more in how it feels to the touch, or sounds beneath the foot.
At the other end of the spectrum are the Philosophers, exploring ideas that straddle the worlds of theory and practice.
"There's an intensity of design, a commitment to new technologies and a passion about detail and materiality in all their work," said Craig Conyk, a New York architect, who served on the Architectural League's selection committee. "It's a very healthy sign for architecture."
In a multi-generational house the Loom team designed in Bangkok, for instance, a rosewood and teak staircase rings as resonantly as a music box, and concrete walls overlap to create openings that weave sunlight into each room.
For Ada Tolla and Giuseppe Lignano of Lotek in Manhattan, the future means embracing discarded industrial and consumer products, turning oil cans into armchairs, detergent bottles into lamps. In a penthouse, they've made a sun-filled bedroom on the roof out of a truck body, and they divided a loft into living and working spaces with a wall made of one sheared side of a 40-foot-long aluminum shipping container. What makes that space so intriguingly efficient is the way the sink and refrigerator are embedded in the room divider, in a manner that recalls Jean Cocteau's anatomical candelabra in "Beauty and the Beast."
And for Brian Healy in Boston, who grew up surrounded by cornfields in Bucks County, Pa., only to watch them give way to subdivisions and strip malls, that experience of transition left him with a desire to "make buildings that tap into a place," even as it changes. Mr. Healy, 42, is designing a modern writer's and artist's studio in the Catskills, with references back to the Arts and Crafts movement, a powerful design force there in the late 19th century.
Mr. Burnette, who has a naturalist's love of desert geology, applies an artist's abstraction to his designs, inspired in part by James Turrell and Richard Serra.
He based his design for a decorator's studio and showroom in Scottsdale, Ariz., on two mesquite trees in the courtyard. Instead of cutting them down, as others had proposed, he wove the trees and the building together, cutting notches in the masonry walls to frame the trees and let them grow.
A self-taught architect who went to work at Frank Lloyd Wright's Taliesin right out of high school, Mr. Burnette aims for rich spatial and textural experiences. Passage through the decorator's studio is labyrinthine: one climbs past several levels that appear to float free of the structure and, at one point, are illuminated by a scrim of Indian onyx so thin that sunlight passing through casts a golden glow on an oak staircase.
"I believe in doing many things with one stroke," Mr. Burnette said, comparing his work to Cartier-Bresson's photography, as it captures and distills a singular moment in space and time.
The tension in the work of Kevin Daly, 41, and Chris Genik, 39, in Santa Monica, Calif., oscillates between technological invention and hands-on craft. High-performance technologies get them going, but so does the chance to work side by side with woodworkers and metalsmiths. For instance, a house in Canada for Mr. Genik's parents bursts like a crystal from a massive pile of boulders. Ten years on the job and still fascinated by clients who dream of the impossible, Mr. Daly and Mr. Genik are interested in "finding the extraordinary in the very familiar." They look for inspiration in the seamless craftsmanship of the physical world -- from a World War II plywood and glue airplane to a tiny 1,000-year-old reliquary covered in gold that bears no trace of tool marks.
While an appeal to the senses and to found objects animates the work of the New Sensualists, the Philosophers, like Asymptote, Evan Douglis and Michael Bell, are investigating ways of building that seem radical today but may well become the traditions of tomorrow.
Hani Rashid, 40, and Lise Anne Couture, 39, of Asymptote utilize the most advanced computer technologies to create a kind of space that exists simultaneously in the real world -- "first-reality architecture," Mr. Rashid calls it -- and in virtual reality.
From their Asymptote office in SoHo's fanciful wrought-iron Singer Building (and their home in the loft next door), Mr. Rashid and Ms. Couture are "set on running all our credit cards into the ground" to realize the objective of designing at the edge of reality through such commissions as a computer-generated theater of operations at the New York Stock Exchange, which opened on Monday. Recently, they designed a showroom for a research company in Kyoto, Japan, to showcase new computer technologies in the hush of a museum-like setting, complete with a black box theater.
Evan Douglis has been on his own since 1991. He has yet to find a client entirely tuned int o his ideas about the poetry of architecture. "Early on, I rejected building at any cost," Mr. Douglis, 39, said at his office in a Chelsea warehouse. "It wasn't necessarily my best move." Luckily, the architect, as director of the Columbia University Architecture Galleries, has been able to commission himself to design installations. Borrowing from military technology for quick-assembly bridges, he suggests an alternative to solidity itself: why not a wall made from weather balloons caged in steel?
Mr. Bell, 38, lives and works in Houston, dividing his time between running his firm (six employees when there's work) and teaching at Rice University. He hopes to combine his theoretical interests "in the sheer brutality of economic forces" with an active commercial practice that gets things built. Most recently, he was the curator of a gallery exhibition in Houston, "16 Houses: Owning a House in the City," which has turned into a commission from Houston's Fifth Ward Community Redevelopment Corporation to build his entry in the show.
His is not necessarily a pretty house. At 900 square feet, the design reminded one local critic of two boomerangs squeezed back to back. All the walls are made of off-the-rack sliding-glass doors to make the point that we all lead transparent lives. The house, which will cost $74,000 or $52,000 with Federal vouchers, was chosen along with others in the exhibition to be built later this year.
"This is really a breakthrough I'm excited about," said Mr. Bell, who has endured seven clients in seven years who he says "chickened out" at the last possible minute. (One client, he said, lost interest when the architect couldn't squeeze the cost of a design down to $36 a square foot, from $38.)
Despite the disappointments of the past, and uncertainty that the housing project will truly happen ("Everyday, I wait for someone to say it's dead," he said), Mr. Bell wants to keep designing houses. After all, he added, houses are "how we imagine ourselves participating in the life of the city and the world."

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: BONDS;
Treasuries Sag As Other Debt Markets Swell

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO

 BODY:
Treasury securities fell in price under the sheer weight of corporate and municipal supply yesterday, as big companies including Lucent Technologies and Freddie Mac sold debt to the public sector.
The 30-year bond fell 11/32, to a price of 95 20/32; its yield, which moves in the opposite direction, rose to 5.55 percent, from 5.53 percent Monday. 
 Freddie Mac sold $3 billion of 10-year notes, and Lucent sold about $1.4 billion of 30-year global bonds.
Freddie Mac priced the 10-year notes to yield 5.81 percent, or about five-eighths of a percentage point more than Treasury notes with a similar maturity.
Lucent, the telephone equipment maker, raised the size of its 30-year bond offering through joint lead managers Bear, Stearns & Company and Merrill Lynch & Company by 36 percent, to $1.36 billion, selling the issue at a price to yield 6.49 percent. That is about 89 basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point, more than a similar Treasury issue.
Prospects of more corporate debt offerings in coming weeks are rising as higher-quality issuers take advantage of a strong economy, little inflation and low interest rates.
The AT&T Corporation plans to sell $5 billion to $6 billion of bonds in three parts as early as next week to help pay for recent acquisitions.
In the market for municipal bonds yesterday, borrowers sold almost half the $5.4 billion of debt expected this week. Among the issues was $700 million in general obligation bonds by the City of New York through underwriters led by Goldman, Sachs & Company. That issue was initially priced to yield a maximum 5.26 percent for a bond due in 2029.
The Massachusetts Turnpike Authority sold $801.8 million of metropolitan highway system revenue bonds through underwriters led by Paine Webber, initially priced to yield a maximum of 5.27 percent for a 40-year bond due in 2039.

HEADLINE: Schools Balk Over Driving Penalties for Students

BYLINE: By DAVID FIRESTONE

DATELINE: FAYETTEVILLE, N.C.

 BODY:
For 10 years now, the teen-age driver's li cense that sacred piece of plastic that confers mobility on the restless -- has been the bull's-eye of every state legislature in the South.
Drop out of high school, and 18 states, 12 of them in the South, will revoke a license. Many of those states will also take it away for poor grades or poor behavior. The laws have proved immensely popular with voters and politicians, who are convinced that they have found the trigger mechanism, the ultimate motivator of the American teen-ager. 
 But among the people who actually teach students and run schools, the license laws are increasingly seen as a waste of time and money, particularly because the time and money are usually theirs, not the state's.
Here in Cumberland County, the school board was already swimming in paperwork, busily revoking the licenses of students with poor attendance and grades, when news recently came that Lieut. Gov. Dennis Wicker had proposed revoking the licenses of disruptive students as well.
Fed up with the state's good intentions, the board voted to oppose the proposal. Using words like "unfunded mandate" and "big government," school officials say they have had enough of the state's helping hand.
"We appreciate the intent of what they're trying to do, but they don't realize the effect these laws have," said Dr. William C. Harrison, superintendent of the county's school district, the fourth-largest in the state, with about 50,000 students. "With all the issues we have on our plate, to overload us now with this kind of paperwork, asking us to do the work of social institutions and the family, well, it's a hard sell around here."
Many educators say parents and the legal system should determine who drives, not school officials, who often have to divert teachers or clerks from educational duties to enforce the law. Louisiana dropped its license-revocation law in 1997 after finding it too expensive. Florida let its law lapse in 1996, but legislators revived it the next year over the objections of school officials.
"We originally thought it would change the dropout rate, but it did not," said Wayne Blanton, executive director of the Florida School Boards' Association. "We found it extremely burdensome, and the paperwork that each principal and guidance counselor had to do was tremendous, and it did not slow down the dropout rate."
But such concerns are not slowing the momentum of the laws. Mr. Wicker's proposal recently passed the State Senate unanimously and appears likely to be enacted. Mr. Wicker said there was plenty of anecdotal evidence that the laws work, so the eventual outcome would be worth the administrative burden.
"The driver's license is a very powerful motivator among young people, particularly in the South where we don't have much mass transit," he said. "To young people, the license means everything. It's their freedom, it's a means of being able to move around and be mobile, which is very important to the life of a young person. They will do all they can possibly can to keep it."
There is no concrete proof that any of the laws have kept students in school or motivated them to work harder. The school dropout rates in many states did not change significantly after the laws were passed, and in other states, economic or educational changes were credited with improving school attendance.
"Anyone who tells you they know these laws work isn't telling the truth, because no one has done a study," said Kathy Christie, policy analyst with the Education Commission of the States, a nonprofit organization based in Denver that compiles data on state education policies.
"Up to now, these laws have been unpopular only with students, so no one has really put the money in to research it. It's politically easy to do, and it doesn't hurt."
Students are of mixed opinion, depending on their academic standing. Stephen Smith, a sophomore at South View High School here, said a license-revocation law would not bother him because he was on the honor roll, though he added that some of his friends were worried.
Barry Davis, a junior at Cape Fear High School, said the law was unfair.
"I'm no good at math," he said. "So why should that mean I can't drive?"
In North Carolina, one of four states to make academic performance a criterion for keeping a license, members of the first group of students to lose their licenses, estimated at 25,000 to 30,000, are just being notified that their grades last semester were below the legal limit.
That number is expected to double in the next two years. Under the law, students under 18 lose their license if they drop out, or if they fail to pass 70 percent of their classes.
The law is particularly popular in small towns, where the administrative burden is less and the loss of a car can be a devastating blow to teen-age freedom.
"What's not to love about it?" said Carol Weaver, principal of the small Cape Hatteras High School in the Atlantic Coast town of Buxton "When you're trying to change kids' behavior you've got to find something they want, and we use it every day in our disciplinary conferences. I ask them, 'Do you want to drive before you're an old man with a cane?' And they do want to drive."
But in larger districts around the state, school officials are less convinced. Edwin Dunlap, executive director of the North Carolina School Boards' Association, said many districts were concerned about such disciplinary tactics.
"It sounds wonderful," Mr. Dunlap said, "but the devil is in the details."
Robert T. Barnes Jr., principal of South View High School, is hardly a role model of political dissent in his Tigers school tie and positive-thinking cheerfulness. But Mr. Barnes gets angry when he talks about the secretaries diverted from scholarship searches to handle the paperwork involved in the law and the growing tension the law is causing between students and his office.
"It's placed us in a very adversarial position with kids, which we don't need," he said, estimating that about 50 of the school's 2,400 students will lose their licenses when letters go out this month. "It's real hard to talk to kids about how can we help them improve when we just told them, 'Give me your driver's license.' The two don't exactly go hand in hand."
Schools must check the grades and attendance of students seeking a license or a learning permit; check the license status of students failing one or more courses and send out warning letters to parents; notify the motor vehicles department on revocations, and hear the appeals of students who might be eligible to keep their license because of work.
The job requires half the time of the secretary to the guidance counselors, Mr. Barnes said, meaning she has less time to perform scholarship searches or send transcripts.
Inveighing against the bill, The Morning Star of Wilmington suggested in a recent editorial that perhaps legislators should forfeit their driver's licenses if they did not stop legislating after a reasonable period.
"There's a good chance," it said, "a few school principals would be willing to do the paperwork."

HEADLINE: Sears Settles Suit on Raising Of Its Credit Card Rates

BYLINE: By LESLIE KAUFMAN

 BODY:
Sears, Roebuck & Company announced yesterday that it would settle a class-action suit from plaintiffs who contended that the retailer had fraudulently raised the annual interest rates on their credit cards after it had promised not to. Sears agreed to pay $36 million in cash and issue store coupons worth $118 million to card holders.
The company's large credit card operations -- about 63 million United States households own a Sears card -- have a troubled history. Just last month, Sears pleaded guilty to Federal changes that it had illegally forced card holders who had filed for personal bankruptcy to pay their Sears debt anyway. Sears paid $475 million in fines and penalties to settle all suits related to those charges. 
 This credit card settlement was unrelated to the bankruptcy issue. From 1994 to 1996, Sears, based in Hoffman Estates, Ill., moved many of its credit card accounts to a credit card bank it had acquired in Arizona. When Sears transferred the accounts, it changed the annual finance charge to 21 percent for all accounts but said that balances accrued before the transfer would continue to be billed at their old rates.
In April 1997, Sears sent a notice that it was changing credit terms. Under the new terms, unpaid balances accrued before the consolidation would be subject to the same annual interest rate that Sears charged on all its other accounts. In some cases, that amounted to a rate increase. Defendants in the class action contended that the first letter amounted to a promise not to change rates and that Sears was breaching the agreement.
In settling the case, Sears admitted no wrongdoing. The action was taken "to avoid the litigation," said Jan Drummond, a company spokeswoman. She also said, "It is an acknowledgment that the communication we sent may have been misconstrued by customers."
Raising credit card rates without customer approval has become a national issue as the credit card business consolidates into fewer and larger hands and banks sell accounts to other banks, which are free to impose whatever interest rate the traffic will bear. But the Sears ruling is not likely have significant effect on the industry. "The issue here is specific to them and their literature," said Anita Boomstein, a partner at Hughes Hubbard & Reed L.L.P. who specializes in credit card law.
The lawsuit was brought on behalf of a nationwide class who were transferred to the Arizona bank and who had not fully paid off their balances when credit terms changed in 1997. All 11 million of these customers will get a coupon worth $7.50 -- even though not all of them had their interest rates changed. Three million customers who had their rates increased will receive a combination of cash and coupons totaling $23.80.
In addition, Sears agreed to spend $3 million for consumer-credit counseling. The settlement is subject to court approval.
Lawyers representing the plaintiffs will receive $15 million in cash.
In a separate development, Sears said yesterday that it would buy back up to $1.5 billion of its stock.
The buyback, which will take place over an unspecified time, represents about 9 percent of the outstanding Sears shares.
Shares of Sears rose $1.3125, to $45.

HEADLINE: Worse Drought Than in '98 Appears Possible in Texas

BYLINE: By RICK LYMAN

DATELINE: HOUSTON, March 10

 BODY:
Still reeling from a 1998 drought that devastated the state's farming and ranching communities, Texas officials are growing increasingly alarmed about what appears to be a potentially more serious drought looming this year.
"There's still time for it to turn around, but we are not looking good over much of the state," said Roland Smith, an agricultural economist at Texas A&M University. "People are really getting nervous." 
 The unusually warm winter and dearth of rainfall, particularly in the western two-thirds of the state, have severely damaged the winter wheat crop and stunted the growth of hay and natural grasses for cattle and other livestock. And during the next two months, a crucial time for the spring plantings of cotton, corn and other crops, drier than normal conditions are predicted for most of the major farming regions.
The Climate Prediction Center of the United States Department of Agriculture lists the trans-Pecos region in far western Texas and most of the state's Mexican border areas as abnormally dry, and the long-term drought severity index shows the trans-Pecos region and parts of the plains of west-central Texas in a state of moderate drought. If rainfall projections hold true, officials say, most of West and South Texas will experience a moderate-to-extreme drought as early as next month.
Gov. George W. Bush and Agriculture Commissioner Susan Combs are expected to unveil drought-related initiatives on Thursday, including declaring emergencies in 170 of the state's 254 counties where dry conditions have created a significant risk of fires.
"We are right today at the same point in drought index comparisons where we were when the Governor declared a drought emergency in June of 1998," Ms. Combs said. "We're three months ahead of last year, and that's what's giving people heartburn."
Despite flooding last fall in cities like Del Rio, Texas is flirting with a second consecutive year of paralyzing drought, the third year of drought in the last four.
"Certain areas of the state did have some very large amounts of rain in the fall," Mr. Smith said. "But that was rains that came so fast that a lot of the water ran off and we haven't had much rain in any of those places since."
And where rain fell over the winter, "none of it has penetrated into the subsoil, which is so necessary to make a reasonable cotton crop," said Carl G. Anderson, an agricultural economist at Texas A&M.
It has also been a particularly windy winter, adding to the problem.
"When the wind blows across the surface of the land, it actually sucks the moisture out," Ms. Combs said.
As a result, the ground is especially dry going into the spring rainy season.
"We keep hoping for three inches or so each time one of these fronts moves through," Mr. Anderson said, "but they just keep on blowing past, dropping just a half-inch here and there, and then heading out East. If it stays dry another six weeks or so, we will see some tremendous damage."
National Weather Service projections call for below-normal rainfall in Texas in the coming months. But even if the spring rains are normal, they may not be enough.
Still, officials say, copious rains might produce an adequate crop.
"There is time for a turn around," Mr. Anderson said.
A bill in the Texas Legislature would provide $25 million in drought relief, but it is intended for those suffering from last year's drought. In October, Congress passed $5.9 billion in disaster aid to farmers affected by droughts nationwide, and $2.4 billion remains to be distributed.
Ms. Combs said Texas officials would urge the Federal Government to speed those payments.
Last year's drought hit all of the state. For the moment, this year's drought threat is more localized.
The trans-Pecos areas have had just 19 percent of the normal average rainfall this winter, Ms. Combs said, and the Edwards Plateau of west-central Texas has had just 24 percent. But the rolling plains, north of the Edwards Plateau, have had 69 percent of normal rainfall, and the high plains of the Panhandle have had 93 percent.
Texas agricultural economists predicted last summer that the 1998 drought would mean a drop of $2.1 billion in the state's farm and ranch production. A report released in February by Texas A&M found that the drop was $2.4 billion, and that $8 billion more was lost in farm-dependent businesses.
Most agricultural economists are loath to speculate, but the Texas Agricultural Extension Service estimated that the 1998 drought persuaded as many as 10 percent of the state's farmers and ranchers to quit.
"People are giving up; they just can't make it," Ms. Combs said.
Calling Texas agriculture "very vulnerable," Mr. Smith said, "Another year like last year, without additional significant Federal help, and we're going to lose a lot of farmers."

HEADLINE: The Land of the Rising Outlook;
Public Spending May Have Reversed Japan's Downturn

BYLINE: By SHERYL WuDUNN

DATELINE: NAKANOJOMACHI, Japan

 BODY:
Bulldozers and tall cranes are popping up around the country like bamboo shoots after a spring rain, and this is raising hopes that Japan may finally be close to lifting itself out of recession.
No other country has ever poured as much money -- more than $830 billion the last 12 months alone -- into economic revival as has Japan, and much of that money is now sloshing around the country and creating a noticeable impact. Here in this village in central Japan, as in much of the country, construction crews are again busy, small companies are getting loans again and some people are feeling a tad more confident. 
 Japanese leaders have traditionally funneled money into brick-and-mortar projects to stimulate the economy, so the signs of life these days are interpreted by most experts as just a temporary comeback, not a self-sustaining recovery. There have been many false starts the last eight years, but the economy has always sunk back, this time into the deepest recession since the end of World War II.
To the pessimists Japan is like a vehicle being towed along the road by all that deficit spending; they doubt its engine will start without an overhaul.
Whatever the reasons for the movement, whatever the concerns for the future, though, the passengers throughout Japan seem relieved that at least the vehicle may be going forward again.
Any progress in Japan would also be a major relief for the rest of the world, since Japan is the second-largest economy after the United States and by far the largest in Asia. Optimists believe that Japan has finally bottomed out.
"I think the worst time has passed," Taichi Sakaiya, Minister of State at the Economic Planning Agency, said in a recent interview in Tokyo. "At least, there will be no further deterioration."
Even he, however, has moderated his view from late last year, when he said he saw a quickening in the economy. "We have to have growth this year," said Mr. Sakaiya, the author of 50 books, including some on the reshaping of Japanese society. "Otherwise, in the scheme of history Japan will be heading into a dark age if negative growth continues."
What is different this time is that the Government is battling the recession on many fronts. It is borrowing more heavily to finance its spending, and it is cleaning up the banking system to alleviate the credit shortage.
The next sign of Japan's progress comes on Friday, when the Government releases its report on the gross domestic product for the last quarter of 1998.
Some good news, at least, has been wending its way from the trenches. Company bankruptcies are plummeting, and orders for new homes are up. Some companies are refocusing their businesses, while others are selling off products that had been piling up in warehouses. Banks, which had slashed their lending under the burden of hundreds of billions of dollars in bad debts, are beginning to ease up on credit. Stocks, especially those of small companies, are rebounding.
The biggest stimulant has come from the Government, which has been pumping taxpayers' money into the construction of dams and bridges and setting up lending programs throughout the country. In a grand giveaway, the Government is also passing out nearly $6 billion in shopping coupons, and there are some signs that the coupons are encouraging consumers to spend more.
Fumio Takahashi, for one, is beaming heartily under his hard hat. Mr. Takahashi, a stocky man in a black suit, runs a small construction company in Nakanojomachi, and he now has several new Government contracts. Those contracts, in turn, have enabled him to borrow $400,000 from the bank.
One of his main projects is a 37.5-yard stretch of road that he is rebuilding and widening, even though the road already provides an adequately smooth car ride. There is also a project to build a 31-yard river embankment and another to build 81 yards of a new road to a dam. Other construction companies have been assigned other segments of the roads and the embankment.
"If there were no public works, this company would be gone -- bankrupt," Mr. Takahashi said as he stood on his dug-up road just a few steps away from a patch of road that a competitor is repaving. "This area is very rural, and there are very few factories, so there are very few jobs. If there is no construction work, we can't make our living."
All this is great news for Mr. Takahashi and his 20 employees. But there are doubts about whether Japan really needs all the wider roads and longer embankments. Mr. Takahashi relies on the Government for 85 percent of his business, and critics say the contracts are simply pork barrel projects created by the dominant Liberal Democratic Party to reward contributors in the construction industry.
Indeed, perhaps one reason Nakanojomachi is so flush is not just that it is needy but also that it is the hometown of Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi. Home constituencies of prime ministers have always received a disproportionate share of construction spending.
Mr. Takahashi acknowledges he is in an industry scoffed at frequently for its inefficiency, but he points out that at least the town has advanced from farming to construction. In any case, he knows his company will not last forever, not even to the next generation. His son has already said that he will not take over the business and hopes instead to find a salaried job at a big company.
A handful of private economists in Tokyo sound a bit more positive than they did a few months ago, but then again they could scarcely have become more negative. Many describe the huge Government stimulus package as having stabilized the economy rather than revived it.
"I think we're bouncing along the bottom a little instead of being in a free fall as we were last year," said Peter Morgan, an economist with HSBC Securities Japan Ltd. "Things are starting to stabilize a bit, but it's not a clear, soaring upward momentum. It's like a gigantic Band-Aid being put around the economy."
Few officials and politicians are as bold about their pronouncements on the economy as Mr. Sakaiya, Japan's top economic official. Ichizo Ohara, a Parliament member and occasional adviser to Prime Minister Obuchi, argues that Japan needs far more money flowing around if it is to strengthen the banks and revive the economy.
When asked if he thought the economy had bottomed out, Mr. Ohara, a former top Finance Ministry official, said it had. But then he reversed himself, reflecting the uncertainty among many experts as they read the mixed signs.
Prices are still falling, signaling deflation. Corporate profits for this fiscal year, which ends March 31, are expected to be dismal -- down nearly 25 percent on average from the previous year. Just last week, the index of leading economic indicators turned down, after two months of pointing upward.
Japanese politicians and economists agree that this year will be critical for the economy, mainly because the leadership is running out of options. The Government is spending so much on the stimulus that its budget deficit is running near 10 percent of total economic output and the national debt burden will soon exceed the size of the $4 trillion economy.
Many municipalities are already broke, and the Government's enormous fund-raising plans have sent shudders through the markets over the last several months and are threatening its previously pristine sovereign credit ratings.
The Bank of Japan, the nation's central bank, also has fewer tricks left in its bag of policy tools, and bank officials privately acknowledge that monetary policy will have limited influence in the near future. Short-term interest rates are already effectively zero.
That is partly why some prominent advisers, foreign economists and analysts are searching for solutions in a broad restructuring of Japan Inc., and a move away from the traditional antidote of paying for public works projects.
"We would like to create a society in which sound and creative competition prevails," said Hirotaro Higuchi, chairman of the Economic Strategy Council, a high-level advisory group set up by Prime Minister Obuchi. "I think it will come earlier than expected because the change in perceptions has already started."
That strategy may hold promise, but it can be very threatening to construction workers like Toshinobu Ichiba, a 37-year-old foreman in Nakanojomachi, which has only 18,600 people. Mr. Ichiba has been a cog in the construction of this picturesque mountainous town, which has essentially been built up with taxpayers' money. That money has paid for many of the roads and the river banks, as well as a long cement tunnel through the mountains and a suspension bridge that looks like a smaller version of the Golden Gate Bridge spanning the entrance to San Francisco Bay.
As the sun faded on his bridge project near a cliff on a recent frosty day, Mr. Ichiba and his co-workers joked about how they had nothing to do last spring except collect paychecks. Now, Mr. Ichiba and his men are building a bridge -- or rather, half of one. The Government has only financed half the bridge, so that is all they will build for now. But they profess not to worry.
"We think there will be work even if our company goes bankrupt," Mr. Ichiba said.
It is precisely this kind of outlook that has led some analysts to call for a radical turnaround in the way companies are managed. The problem, they say, is that people do not feel enough of a sense of crisis.
Still, however measured, some change is beginning to appear in the corporate world. A number of Japanese companies are selling less profitable business lines, as well as assets like buildings, resort clubs and land. While mass layoffs are still taboo, companies are edging unproductive workers off the payroll.
Some hope that Japan may be able to engineer a "jobless recovery," in which the economy can improve as companies melt the fat from their payrolls and reposition their businesses to compete more effectively. Still, while restructuring may improve Japan's economy in the long run, the initial result may be the opposite. The first consequence will be an increase in the number of the unemployed, now three million, and perhaps more of the sense of unease that usually leads workers here to save rather than spend.
"On the surface, people may be persuaded that the economy may have hit the bottom, but the speed is slow," said Teizo Taya, an economist at the Daiwa Institute of Research. "How can you expect a recovery of consumption when companies are busy restructuring themselves?"

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
Despite Gains, Some Have Doubts

BYLINE: By MICHAEL M. WEINSTEIN

 BODY:
Have Japanese officials -- finally -- turned economic policy around?
After a decade-long stagnation caused in part by inadequate Government measures of the past, there are some promising signs. Monetary policy, for instance, at least seems to be heading in a more expansionary direction, putting it in line with a more stimulative fiscal policy as well. And over the last few weeks, key bank and finance officials have issued oblique promises to follow through on these moves, though few definitive commitments. 
 But even the American economists who follow the Japanese economy are not sure how much policy has actually changed. And there is the ominous possibility, expressed by one prominent expert, that even if the Japanese do everything they now hint at that the economy may still remain sick.
The Japanese economy had been the envy of the world throughout the 1970's and 1980's, growing faster than other industrialized economies with only a whiff of inflation. But the crash of its securities and real estate markets in the late 1980's undermined the solvency of many big banks, whose loans were tied to real estate. Bank loans to creditworthy borrowers shriveled. Last year the economy sank into recession, shrinking by about 3 percent.
Making matters worse, deflation has set in. Wholesale prices have been falling for years and now consumer prices appear to be falling. By creating the expectation that prices will continue to fall, deflation gives consumers and companies perverse incentives to postpone purchases. That can set off a downward spiral of falling spending, production, income and jobs.
The West has accused the Japanese of tolerating a decade of stagnation with barely a whimper. But Prof. Allan Meltzer of Carnegie Mellon University, who serves, along with a Stanford University professor, John Taylor, as an "honorary adviser" to the Bank of Japan, provides a plausible explanation. "The Japanese saw no reason to panic for most of the decade, confident that their vaunted economy would recover in a matter of months," he said.
But months turned into years. "It was not until Korea collapsed in the fall of 1997," Mr. Meltzer continued, "that the Japanese realized that the problem would not go away. So while the West thinks the Japanese have been dawdling for 10 years, the Japanese think they've been wrestling with the problem for only about 15 months."
And over those 15 months, he says, Tokyo has done "a surprising amount."
Adam Posen of the Institute for International Economics and author of a recent book on the Japanese economy, agrees. Japan is running a huge budget deficit -- 10 percent of national output and rising. (At its most recent peak in 1983, the United States Federal deficit reached 6.1 percent of annual output.) Though he would like to see even- larger tax cuts, it can no longer be said that Japanese fiscal stimulus is lacking.
The Japanese have also moved decisively in recent months to clean up their banks. The Government is paying off depositors at failed banks, nationalizing insolvent banks that the Government decides to keep open and pumping public money into shaky but solvent banks in exchange for stock. The three-pronged reform aims to give insolvent borrowers a fresh start and build up banks' capital reserves so that they can resume lending.
But few economists think that fiscal stimulus and bank reform alone are enough. The outside advisers have called on the Japanese central bank to pump enough new money into the economy to stop prices from falling.
Why has Japan delayed? Apart from an ideological fear of doing anything that hints of inflation, one big reason is that Tokyo might fear retaliation from the United States. Once the central bank prints more yen, they will leak into the foreign exchange market and drive down the value of the yen against the dollar. That will make Japan's goods cheaper to buy in America and America's goods more expensive to buy in Japan -- worsening an already huge trade imbalance and possibly igniting protectionist measures in Congress. Officials also worry that a falling yen will spread to other currencies in Asia, creating a contagion of currency depreciations in already fragile financial markets.
But maybe the Japanese, driven by the greater needs of their own economy at the moment, are overcoming their reluctance to offend Uncle Sam. Eisuke Sakakibara, vice minister of finance and Japan's most outspoken advocate of a strong yen, has reversed course and stated it would be O.K. if the Japanese currency fell in value. And the central bank has driven down short-term interest rates within a few tenths of a percentage point of zero. And, as predicted, the exchange rate has fallen, so that it now takes about 120 yen to buy a dollar.
But Dan Bernstein, director of research at Bridgewater Associates, cautions against overinterpreting these recent straws in the wind. The central bank's monetary policy may be more lenient, but the change is not dramatic, he says. And the Bank of Japan's public pronouncements continue to focus on interest rates, not flooding the economy with more money.
American economists point out that policy does not need to rely on driving interest rates lower -- they already are near zero anyway -- to pump up spending. The central bank can print new yen in order to buy lots of assets, from commercial paper to foreign exchange. Eventually, the extra yen should lift consumer spending. A recent statement by a board member of the Bank of Japan suggests that some of his colleagues are thinking about focusing on inflation rather than interest rates.
Paul Krugman, professor of economics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, has provocatively called on the central bank to go further, much further. He argues that consumers and companies will not start spending as long as they believe that prices will keep falling.
So Mr. Krugman has urged the Government to "credibly promise to be irresponsible." That may not be the most diplomatic way to encourage the ever-cautious Japanese. But it does drive home the point that nothing short of expanding the money supply to build in the expectation that prices will start rising for the indefinite future will prod the Japanese into deciding to spend now rather than later.
Let's take the tantalizing hints out of the finance ministry and central bank at face value. Fiscal and monetary policies will ease more and bank reform will proceed. Mission accomplished?
Not so fast, say Prof. Ronald McKinnon of Stanford and Kenichi Ohno of Saitama University in Japan. They reject their colleagues' optimism. Bank reform and monetary and fiscal easing, they agree, are not enough to solve Japan's woes.
They trace Japan's problem to decades of pressure by Washington to raise the value of the yen in a losing effort to eliminate the United States trade deficit with Japan. In fact, the yen rose, in dollar terms, by 4 percent a year from the 1970's to the 1990's.
Mr. McKinnon points out that investors who expect the yen to rise will accept lower interest payments on bonds denominated in yen compared with bonds denominated in dollars. It is no accident, then, that interest rates are generally about four percentage points lower in Japan than in the United States. But since interest rates have dropped in the United States, they have been pushed down to near zero in Japan. At that rate, banks cannot make any profit on loans and the economy cannot, therefore, recover.
The way out of this bind, Mr. McKinnon says, is to raise interest rates in Japan. That requires "wiping out the expectation that the yen will rise." He proposes that the United States and Japan agree to stabilize the value of the yen at about 130 to the dollar, the rate at which a dollar buys about as many hamburgers and computers in Japan as it does in the United States.
"The expectation that the yen would continue to rise was not created solely by Japan, and cannot be solved solely by Japan," he said.
If Mr. McKinnon is correct, then recovery in Japan depends on an accord that officials in neither country appear prepared to adopt. So a more plausible course, for now, is for the Japanese to print money galore -- and cross their fingers that the weaker yen that would be a consequence of such a policy will not touch off protectionism in the United States or worsen the financial situation across the rest of Asia.

HEADLINE: FIGHT OVER ORGANS SHIFTS TO STATES FROM WASHINGTON

BYLINE: By SHERYL GAY STOLBERG

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 10

 BODY:
The battle over the nation's scarcest medical resource, human organs, has moved from Washington to the states, where a number of legislatures have begun passing laws that would bar donated hearts, lungs, kidneys, livers and pancreases from being shipped beyond their borders to sick people elsewhere in the country.
So far, the laws have not had a large effect on the way organs are distributed. Rather, they are intended to thwart an effort by the Clinton Administration to force organ recovery networks and transplant centers around the nation to share their precious organs more liberally.
"They changed the rule, so I introduced legislation," Gov. Tommy G. Thompson of Wisconsin said in a telephone interview on Tuesday. "In this state, we go out and aggressively encourage people to be donors, with me doing public service announcements. If I'm going to do that, I want those organs to stay in the state and take care of the patients that need it in Wisconsin."
Four other states -- Louisiana, Oklahoma, South Carolina and Florida -- have adopted laws similar to Wisconsin's. In Arizona, lawmakers in both houses have approved similar bills, but they include differences that must be ironed out. Legislation has been introduced in Texas.
More than 61,000 Americans are now waiting for organ transplants, but only about 20,000 transplants are performed each year because the demand for organs far outweighs the supply. Under the current system for sharing organs, the nation is divided into 63 areas comprising 11 regions, and there are huge disparities in waiting times from area to area and region to region. For instance, for patients with blood type O, who represent 47 percent of the nation's liver transplant candidates, the median waiting time in New York City is 511 days while the median time in northern New Jersey is only 56 days.
Last spring, Donna E. Shalala, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, announced her intention to even out those waiting times by giving organs to the most sick patients first, regardless of where they lived. Dr. Shalala said the current system "put geography ahead of medical need." But the plan, issued in the form of a Federal regulation, engendered such a bitter fight among transplant doctors, hospitals and patients that Congress delayed its effective date until Oct. 1.
The debate will come to the fore in Washington on Thursday when the Institute of Medicine, an arm of the National Academy of Sciences, starts its own examination of the organ allocation system. The review is being conducted at the request of Congress; the institute has appointed a panel of 16 experts, including surgeons, ethicists, epidemiologists and a health care economist to carry out the study.
"We need an objective reviewer," said Louise Jacobbi, executive director of the Louisiana Organ Procurement Agency in Metairie, La. In 1997, Ms. Jacobbi, aware that the Federal Government was about to change its rules, was instrumental in persuading her state to become the first to enact a law putting its own residents first. That law has become a model for the other states.
"Fundamentally, we have been rationing organs since the beginning of transplantation," she said. "We have always had fewer organs than we have had patients. If we are going to change the way we practice medicine, it needs to be based on good medical data."
The institute, which hopes to finish its study by September, will present its findings to Congress, which may decide to step in and overhaul the allocation system on its own. But if Congress does not act, the entire issue could wind up in court, with Wisconsin and the other states suing the Federal Government in a state's rights dispute over which provision -- the Clinton Administration's rule or state laws -- takes precedence.
Dr. Claude Earl Fox, administrator of the Health Resources and Services Administration, which oversees the organ allocation system, said in an interview that the new regulation superseded state law. But in a suit filed in Louisiana last spring, the Louisiana Attorney General contended the opposite, saying that only an act of Congress, and not a bureaucratic regulation, could override a state law.
That suit is being held in abeyance while the Federal rule is on hold. But should the Administration's plan go into effect, Governor Thompson said Wisconsin would probably also sue.
"This rule is unconstitutional," Mr. Thompson said. "It pre-empts state's rights."
The current organ donation system is 15 years old; it flows out of a 1984 law called the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Act, which gives the Department of Health and Human Services authority to regulate the national organ distribution system. The law prohibited the buying and selling of organs and declared them a national resource.
As it stands, the system works this way: A private, nonprofit organization, the United Network for Organ Sharing, contracts with the health and human services agency to distribute donated organs. The network has divided the country into 11 regions. Within those regions, there are 63 local organ procurement organizations, whose job it is to obtain and distribute organs.
Under the current rules, organs are offered first within the local area, then regionwide, then nationally. But the system is incredibly Balkanized; Dallas and Fort Worth, for instance, share an airport and are only 30 miles apart, yet they belong to different organ procurement organizations and do not share organs. If there are extra livers or kidneys in Fort Worth, they are offered to patients in Houston, four hours away.
"It's a tragedy," said Dr. Goran B. Klintmalm, chief of transplant surgery at the Baylor University Medical Center in Dallas.
This is his solution: Baylor is about to set up a satellite transplant center in Fort Worth, so that its Dallas patients will be eligible for organs that otherwise would have gone to Houston.
"We don't want to duplicate services," Dr. Klintmalm said, "but it's the only way we can make organs stay in the metroplex."
The Clinton Administration's rule ordered the organ-sharing network to come up with a new system that would distribute organs more broadly. The Administration said that if network officials did not change the system on their own, the Department of Health of Human Services would change it for them. But the network, which is composed mostly of representatives from the smaller transplant centers, said its members preferred the current system.
In the wake of Dr. Shalala's announcement of the new rule, doctors at some of the centers, along with officials of the local organ procurement organizations, began pressing their state legislators to pass laws that would keep organs within state boundaries. Most of the laws include provisions stating that states can share organs, so long as they have reciprocal arrangements with other states. Even so, they have been criticized as provincial.
"Oklahoma has been castigated," complained Robert Turner, executive director of the Oklahoma Organ Sharing Network. "We have been called narrow-minded, self-centered, not caring for others. Actually, our law is pretty moderate. It says that we can't bypass local patients unless we get a payback for the organ."
In Ohio, the Legislature stopped short of passing a law, but adopted a resolution that urged Dr. Shalala to give greater weight to the views of transplant centers. A transplant surgeon at one center, Dr. Douglas Hanto of the University of Cincinnati Medical Center, said of the Federal plan: "If this rule goes through, you will see more and more states passing laws. And it will be a huge controversy. I don't think that Donna Shalala or Bill Clinton really understands the degree of opposition to this rule."
Federal officials, however, say the state laws are misguided.
"We know that, on average, about a third of all organ recipients go outside their state of residence to get a transplant," Dr. Fox said. "We have a lot of sharing that is going on across state lines. States, in my opinion, could be shooting themselves in the foot by passing language that restricts that."
Underlying the dispute is an economic turf war between transplant centers, which are competing for their share of the transplant business, in which an operation can cost $250,000 or more. On one side are large hospitals, which tend to have long waiting lists of patients who tend to be sicker; they would presumably benefit from the new rule by receiving additional organs now being used elsewhere. On the other side are small transplant centers, which fear Dr. Shalala's plan could put them out of business by stripping them of their supply of organs.
"It's a mess," said Dr. John J. Fung, who directs the transplant program at the University of Pittsburgh, one of the largest in the nation, and is a staunch advocate of increased sharing. "Everybody is hunkering down and protecting their own turf. It's only going to get nastier, and the sooner we get it resolved the sooner the healing process will begin. All we are doing now is making the wounds bigger and bigger."

HEADLINE: Luster of New York's Trash Dims in Virginia

BYLINE: By DAVID W. CHEN

DATELINE: SUSSEX, Va., March 4

 BODY:
In this bucolic slice of southeastern Virginia, sturdy farmhouses command vast fields of peanuts, soybeans and cotton. Slender loblolly pines poke through the flat, wet terrain, like celery stalks wedged into a marshy bog. It seems like a Robert Penn Warren poem sprung to life.
But if this county is rich in beauty, it is also poor in opportunities. For years, the courthouse had no indoor plumbing, and so little space that defendants occasionally had to wait outside before their arraignments. No new schools have been built in 30 years, and teachers had to make do with antiquated equipment. 
 That was before Sussex County discovered garbage.
Five years ago, the county embarked on a risky, controversial path that many people believed would improve their struggling economy, even though it would jeopardize their beloved environs: a private, technologically advanced landfill that would import thousands of tons of garbage a day, much of it from New York City.
A result, so far, is that the landfill, while still far from beloved, now generates one-third of all annual local revenues -- more than $12.3 million so far in taxes and fees. It has enabled the county to hold taxes steady, build a new courthouse and wastewater plant, and break ground on a new $15 million high school.
Now, though, Sussex County has found itself in the middle of a multistate battle over trash that has once again prompted many people here to try to reconcile their economic needs and environmental concerns, pragmatism and principles.
Trash has become a hot topic in an election year, with politicians deploring Virginia's status as the second-biggest importer of out-of-state trash, after Pennsylvania. Egged on by Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's insouciant suggestion that Virginia should accept New York's trash in return for the city's cultural and financial contributions, the Virginia General Assembly approved legislation last month limiting garbage imports. And Senator Charles S. Robb, a Democrat, and Senator John W. Warner, a Republican, have reached across party lines to co-sponsor a bill that would also retrict the flow of garbage.
Most Virginians have applauded such antitrash, anti-New York reflexes. But here in Sussex, one of several places in Virginia, Pennsylvania and Ohio that import garbage, the reaction has been more ambivalent.
"We'd rather not have it, but we're caught between a rock and a hard place, because the county is in bad shape and we need the money," said Bill Jenkins, 40, a peanut farmer who was eating breakfast at the Virginia Diner in Wakefield. He initially opposed the landfill; now he tolerates it.
"What else can we do?" Mr. Jenkins continued, as the diner's owners, Bill and Mary Ann Galloway, nodded. "If we don't have this dump, the next thing they're going to do is raise taxes on the land. I don't see another solution."
For years, several of Virginia's rural landfills, including the Atlantic Waste Disposal landfill in Sussex, faced no limits on importing garbage.
But under State Senate proposals, which have the support of Gov. James S. Gilmore 3d, Virginia would be able to limit a landfill's intake, ban garbage barges on major rivers and regulate waste more rigorously. The Robb-Warner bill, meanwhile, would restrict the interstate commerce of garbage as well, and allow states to collect fees on imported trash.
Sussex officials worry that any reduction in trash revenues may hamper an economy already sapped by declines in agriculture and manufacturing, said Mary E. Jones, the county administrator.
Situated 45 miles southeast of Richmond, this county of 10,000 has long struggled to get by. One-fifth of the county's residents live in poverty, almost double the state average. The school system perennially ranks near the bottom. The teen-age pregnancy rate is triple the state average.
"The work force is not that great, and you have a small working pool to grow from," said Thomas Rose, 57, a lawyer who was having lunch at the Thornton General Store in the village of Sussex. "We're not going to get anything high-tech."
To compensate, Sussex has absorbed industries that more prosperous areas would avoid: two state prisons, hog farms and, in 1994, the landfill in the county's northwest corner.
The question of whether to build the landfill sharply divided the community; the final vote by the Board of Supervisors was 4 to 3.
Some are still smarting from the experience.
"Sussex counts on the money, but sometimes you've got to think above money," said Rhonda Powell, postmistress of the tiny post office in the village of Yale. "People are tired of getting all these things to get money, instead of getting something more acceptable. You don't want to be thought as, 'All we can get is the dregs.' "
Others, meanwhile, have grumbled that the county has received less money than originally promised. But Ms. Jones said that without the landfill, the county might have had to double or triple the tax rate.
Now owned by Waste Management Inc., the landfill covers 1,315 acres, or roughly the combined size of Central and Prospect Parks in New York. Up to 50 percent of its 4,200 daily tons of trash comes from New York City; the rest is from Maryland, northern Virginia and Washington. About three-quarters of the trash comes by truck, the rest by rail, said Jerry Johnson, the site's general manager.
Inside the dump, the New York connection is easy to spot: an I Love New York bag here, a mustard-colored bag from a Chinatown noodle shop there, New York newspapers all over the place.
Outside, it is easy to find Sussex residents who feel queasy about the landfill's odors, the trucks lumbering down Route 460 or just the idea of the highest hill in Sussex (450 feet) rising in their backyard.
It was only a couple of weeks ago that a Sussex-bound truck carrying New York City garbage overturned on Interstate 295.
"It's stinking up the place," said Floyd Edward Hardy 3d, a Bronx native who moved to the town of Waverly almost a decade ago and now works at a Hardee's restaurant. "I think that every state should take care of their own trash."
To gain perspective, New Yorkers should put themselves in Sussex's shoes, said Tom Raines, the county registrar and a farmer whose family can trace its Virginia roots to the 1600's.
"Tell New Yorkers that we like this landfill as much as they would if it sat in the middle of Central Park," said Mr. Raines, who was among those eating lunch at the Thornton General Store.
It is understandable why some Sussex residents are prickly about New York. A couple of years ago, The New York Post annoyed many people when it described the county as a "dirt-poor, dirt-filled" place with a "warren of tar-paper shacks" and potbellied residents who couldn't get enough of New York's refuse.
Most Sussex people work hard and just scrape by, occupying small, well-groomed bungalows or mobile homes. They take pride in their surroundings. They pray at the county's 60-odd churches, most of them Baptist. They also make this the kind of friendly, leisurely place where a cup of coffee with a stranger turns into a few cups, then some biscuits, then maybe a full meal.
But whenever the conversation veers from hometown pride to local affairs to environmental fears, the same nagging conundrum remains: Has the landfill been worth it?
During interviews with more than three dozen people during a few days, the answer was a resounding "Not sure." On the streets of Waverly, Thelma W. Wyatt, a former English teacher who now teaches at one of the state prisons, initially voiced solid opposition, then paused to consider the other factors.
"I can't stand the smell," said Mrs. Wyatt, 54, who supports the proposed curbs on garbage intake. "We're supposed to have clean fresh air in the rural area here. But I think people have accepted it, because they definitely needed a school, and they felt that they didn't have much of a choice but to go with this."
In the peanut fields of Stony Creek, Marvin Wachsman, a farmer who harvests timber, peanuts and soybeans, also straddled the issue.
"I've got enough sense to know that we've got no other choice, but we're a little afraid about what's going to happen to the environment in the future," said Mr. Wachsman, 55, who was nuzzling twin newborn calves under threatening skies. "There are no easy answers."

HEADLINE: TARNISHED GOLD: A special report.;
From an Innocent Bid to Olympic Scandal

BYLINE: By Kirk Johnson; This article is based on reporting by Jo Thomas, Kirk Johnson and Jere Longman, and was written by Mr. Johnson.

DATELINE: SALT LAKE CITY

 BODY:
David R. Johnson and Thomas K. Welch were lionized in 1995 when they delivered the right to stage the 2002 Winter Olympic Games to a city that had tried and failed for 30 years. But after that it was a long, hard fall.
An independent ethics panel investigating how the Salt Lake City bid committee used cash payments and college scholarships to influence Olympic officials has identified Mr. Johnson and Mr. Welch -- two of the committee's senior officers -- as the central culprits. Federal prosecutors are exploring criminal charges against them. Their reputations are in jeopardy. And yet they have remained surprisingly steadfast in their positions: they don't regret a thing. 
 Indeed, Mr. Johnson, the bid committee's former vice president, said that if he had one misgiving about how Salt Lake City won the Olympics it was that its officials were not more open about their tactics. "They should have said, 'Of course we have scholarships,' " he said. "It was a way of winning the bid, to increase our ways to communicate."
And Mr. Welch, the former head of the Salt Lake City effort, said his lack of regret in looking back matches exactly the lack of guilt he felt when he was waging the campaign in the early 1990's.
"The whole atmosphere was, hey, you're paying homage to these people," Mr. Welch said of the lavishments he and others bestowed on members of the International Olympic Committee who decide where to hold the Games. "We don't like that, but that's the game. That's the rush, if you want to join the fraternity."
Salt Lake City's long effort to join the Olympic fraternity -- sometimes brazen, sometimes comic, and all the while relying on inside information provided by other Olympic cities -- comes to detailed life in hundreds of pages of internal bid committee documents obtained by The New York Times and in interviews with many committee staff workers and volunteers. The documents, as well as the first extensive interviews with Mr. Welch and Mr. Johnson, also strongly suggest that many Salt Lake City bid committee officials beyond the two former committee officers -- and within the Olympic family in general -- had fully accepted the coarse financial facts of what had to be done to become an Olympic city.
Other issues regarding what happened here and who knew about it are still unfolding. There are conflicting accounts, witnesses who have yet to be questioned and assertions of innocence or culpability that will not be resolved until various Federal and state investigators complete their work -- if then.
Mr. Johnson said he told Anita DeFrantz, the senior I.O.C. member from the United States, "everything" about scholarships and cash payments; she said that is not true.
An internal work paper from the accounting firm of Ernst & Young asserts that senior bid committee officials, including some leaders of major Utah corporations, were fully briefed in 1995 about questionable payments; they deny that.
Staff workers and volunteers who toiled in the bid committee's dingy downtown offices say that everyone knew which I.O.C. children were on scholarship, who was coming in for their checks and when, and who among the regular I.O.C. visitors was the greediest or most gracious; most of their bosses, excepting Mr. Welch and Mr. Johnson, say they didn't know a thing.
Last May, about six months before the scandal broke, minutes and handwritten notes taken during bid committee meetings in 1994 and 1995, including detailed discussions about the status of the campaign in its final climactic months, were destroyed by the committee's law firm. Officials with the firm have no explanation, and characterize the destruction as strange.
And it all, in the end, may have been unnecessary. Salt Lake City, which had pursued the Olympics for 30 years as part of a broad economic development plan to build a winter tourism industry, had actually pulled together a legitimate proposal that Olympic officials across the globe concede was, on its merits, unmatched.
George Mitchell, the former United States senator from Maine who led one of the inquiries into the city's effort, March 1 summed up what he called the tragedy of the episode: Salt Lake City officials, he said, "did not need to stoop to the level of this improper and inappropriate conduct."
 
New Approach
From Unsophisticated To Well Educated
In 1966, when Salt Lake City was making its first run at the Winter Games, for 1972, the bid committee commissioned a translation of its promotional materials into French, including a geographical description: Utah, the text said, is located in the "Great Basin of the West." The translator hired by the committee took the language a bit too literally, however, and used the phrase "Grand Basin," which in French meant that Utah was in the "Toilet of the West." The mistake was caught just in time when a professor at the University of Utah was asked to look over the proofs.
"It shows you how unsophisticated we were," said Walker Wallace, a retired businessman and former ski racer who was on the committee.
Mr. Wallace said the city's long shot chances at landing the Games were further made clear at a stuffy cocktail reception later in 1966, in Rome, when a salesman from Salt Lake City suddenly decided to approach one of the haughtier Olympic committee members in the room, a member of European royalty. The salesman walked up, put his arm around the I.O.C. official and started talking up the virtues of Wasatch Mountain powder snow.
Mr. Wallace still recalls the rebuke that ended their conversation, "Remove your arm from my shoulder."
Salt Lake City's 1966 effort was more than unpolished, it was cheap. The organizers scraped together $24,000 by selling Olympic pins for $1 each, raised $5,000 more in donations, and created an organization called Olympics for Utah Incorporated, which was designed to appeal to the French-tinged I.O.C. with its acronym, O.U.I. The committee even had $10,305 left over at the end, according to the two-page audit that Mr. Wallace saved.
Over the next three decades, Salt Lake City became much more serious about its Olympic ambitions. Once an isolated outpost in the scenic West, the city was beginning to feel the need to make a name for itself, local historians and civic experts say, and to shed a bit of its insular history as the central city in the Mormon religion.
But there was also a powerful momentum from within the state driving the Olympic efforts: economic development. The organizers of the first bid in 1966 did more than simply start the Olympic machine, economists and public policy experts say. They forged a kind of symbiotic relationship that fed on itself. Going after the Olympics created publicity for Utah tourism, and the growth of tourism over the years in turn reinforced the rationale for going after the Olympics and further enhanced the city's chances.
The former Salt Lake City mayor, Palmer DePaulis, said that people who question the value of the Olympics now have forgotten how tough things were -- the mining industry was sinking, agriculture and ranching were struggling, too. "The Olympics was looked at as something that would jump-start the economy and help bring jobs and investment," Mr. DePaulis said.
Throughout the three decades of trying, though, Salt Lake City never quite shook the sense that it had some inadequacy or provincialism to overcome, residents and former bid committee officials say. Mr. Welch recalled that as late as 1989, for example, Salt Lake City bid officials showed up empty-handed at an I.O.C. meeting in Puerto Rico.
"When we arrived there, the Greeks were entertaining on their yacht, with gorgeous hostesses," he said. "Atlanta had rented a mansion, shipped in furniture from Atlanta and called it the Atlanta House. Toronto had set up a whole wing out by the pool and were serving breakfasts, lunches and dinners to the I.O.C.
"Everyone was giving wonderful gifts -- I think there were crystal vases and jewelry," Mr. Welch said. "Bid cities each had limousines. We showed up with nothing -- on a bus. We called home, and they went and got some letter openers for us and brought them to us so we'd have something."
That insecurity was deepened by uncertainty over just how the competitions were being conducted.
In 1991, with a solid bid package in place for the 1998 Games, Salt Lake officials received a letter from Patrick Hickey, the president of Ireland's Olympic committee, who let drop that some I.O.C. members had contracted to sell their votes for $100,000 to the city of Nagano, Japan.
And on the eve of the vote for the 1998 Games, Mr. Welch said, he was approached by the son of an I.O.C. member who said he could help secure a handful of votes for Utah for $35,000. Mr. Welch and others refused, in part because they didn't have the money. Nagano won by four votes.
Later, in 1993, despite being the leading candidate for the 2002 Games, Salt Lake City bid committee officials were reminded that nothing was a certainty. According to the minutes of a bid committee meeting, for example, Ms. DeFrantz, the senior I.O.C. representative in the United States, cautioned against complacency.
So the Salt Lake City rules evolved: Do no harm, take no chances and say yes to just about anything.
"Everything we had was about getting the bid," Mr. Johnson said. "All our money was to get votes."
 
Strategy
'We Had to Get The African Vote'
Given how aggressively, and even excessively, Salt Lake City came to pursue the 2002 Games, it is almost quaint to examine the committee's earlier records. In March 1991, for example, during the campaign for the 1998 Winter Games, Prince Albert of Monaco, a bobsled racer and I.O.C member, arrived in Utah in jeans and a flannel shirt and with a disdain for protocol and limousines, former staffers said. But committee records show that officials did manage to buy him something. Mr. Johnson's reimbursement slip for the visit records a single stop, at a 7-Eleven store, for "juice for Prince Albert." Cost: $2.73.
Others, it turned out in the years to come, demanded more. They were not denied.
Indeed, the bid committee, working from 1991 to 1995 to secure the Games, gave and gave -- at least $1.2 million to I.O.C. members and their families and much beyond that in attention and personal favors.
Dame Mary Alison Glen-Haig, a committee member from England, got to play cards late into the night at the house of Salt Lake City's Mayor, Deedee Corradini. The children of I.O.C. members from Mali and Cameroon received more than $100,000 each in scholarships and payments.
It could all be quite matter of fact.
According to staffers at the committee, Sibo Sibandze, the son of the I.O.C. member from Swaziland, would with regularity turn up at the second-floor offices at the corner of 200 East and 200 South, open the door and ask, "Where's my check?" And the checks would be cut: $250 one week, $590 the next.
"You knew these guys, they came in weekly," said Jason Christensen, a volunteer staffer. "You saw them pick up their checks. You took them places. You didn't have to be a brain surgeon to know what was going on. It was always whispered, 'Whose son is he? How much of a scholarship is he getting? How does that work? People freaked out the first time they heard about it. Then it became second nature."
It could occasionally feel reckless, too.
By the spring of 1995, according to a list of bid committee payments, money was often being spent with no support documentation, including a $30,000 check for cash at First Security bank for unknown purposes. Gifts to beneficiaries designated as "various I.O.C. members" reached more than $150,000.
From February 1993 to February 1996, the bid committee paid installments of $500 that totaled $14,500 to a Raouf Scally, who was thought to be a relative of an I.O.C. member. Local Olympic officials still have no certain idea who Scally is or what North African country he came from.
But for the overwhelming part, the operation run out of the charmless downtown offices -- mismatched furniture, empty pizza boxes -- was targeted and relentless.
The bid's strategy, Mr. Johnson said, dictated that African committee members be pursued, not necessarily because those members had their hands out, but because they were the swing votes. The city's analysis showed that no Olympic contestant had ever won without African members' support.
"We had to get the African vote," said Johnson, who resigned earlier this year. "We had to get them early, get it done, maintain contact and maintain momentum."
But there was more than just a plan. Bid committee officials also had detailed personal information on their I.O.C. targets, from the dossiers prepared by previous bid cities such as Sydney, Australia.
Of David Sibandze, the I.O.C. member from Swaziland who was forced to resign in February, one dossier said: "Always made reference that he has a big mortgage to pay during visits to 1996 candidate cities. Bad reputation. Insincere." Sibandze and his son could not be reached for comment despite repeated efforts.
Other files offered more innocent insights: of Anton Geesink of the Netherlands, one dossier said, "Loves to get the opportunity for group sing-alongs."
Most, though, cut to the chase. "Doesn't speak much English," a scouting report said of Sergio Santander Fantani of Chile, another committee member who has since been expelled. "But managed to understand him to say, 'Salt Lake must win.' "
And bid committee officials say they were just as straightforward about their campaign when talking to people in the Olympic family. Mr. Johnson, for instance, insists he kept Ms. DeFrantz, the senior American I.O.C. member, updated. He said she would frequently ask him which way the members were leaning and what it had taken to gain their allegiance.
"From 1992 to 1995, every time we had an I.O.C. member visit Salt Lake, she either flew to Salt Lake or during their visit would talk to them on the telephone," Mr. Johnson said of Ms. DeFrantz. "She would call me and ask, 'Was he good or was he bad?' She wanted to know if someone had asked us to do something that would put us in a difficult position."
If an I.O.C. member had asked or demanded favors, Mr. Johnson said that Ms. DeFrantz's response was, " 'That's not good,' or something like that. She didn't say, 'Don't do it.' "
Mr. Johnson's charge is explosive. If Ms. DeFrantz knew of the misconduct in Salt Lake City and did nothing to report or correct it, her reputation as one of the most powerful and upright figures in international sport could be damaged.
In a series of interviews, Ms. DeFrantz emphatically refuted Mr. Johnson's claims.
"I was never asked if it was O.K., or if they should do anything, or if it was a way to win the Games," she said. "Those discussions never happened."
 
Relationships
Ties That Bind And Tear Apart
It is easy to imagine a universe where a scrappy, effusive attorney from Ogden, Utah, named Tom Welch would live a whole life and never meet a mercurial politician from Congo Republic named Jean-Claude Ganga. But given the logic and machinery of the Olympic site selection process that was in place in the 1990's, it is, in a sense, hard to imagine anything else.
For the Salt Lake City bid committee, Mr. Welch was the pre-eminent giver of gifts and cash, Mr. Ganga the pre-eminent taker. Of the $15 million that the bid committee spent in winning the 2002 Winter Games, Mr. Ganga got more than anyone -- at least $250,000, according to the board of ethics report last month.
But Mr. Welch and Mr. Ganga -- and the relationship that bound them -- were also far more complex than the dry text of ledger sheets and investigative reports have suggested. Indeed, they were much alike: both men of large gestures and appetites, both capable, it seems, of the grand impulse one moment and an improper one the next.
Mr. Ganga, 64, made his reputation in Africa as a fighter against the apartheid system. He once stood on a makeshift athletic field in Congo Republic, watching with tears streaming down his face as a group of barefoot boys tried to play soccer with a homemade ball of weeds and duct tape, according to Mr. Welch, who was there.
Within the bid committee, however, Mr. Ganga was known as "the human vacuum cleaner" for his ability to take in whatever crossed his path. When he came to town, staffers, with an effort at comic cynicism, called it "Ganga time." He took thousands of dollars of free medical care, from hepatitis treatment for himself to a knee replacement for his mother-in-law. He was put up in an apartment here, and after the family departed, the Gangas' appliances were handed out. One staff member got a toaster, another received a blender.
Mr. Welch, 54, a former corporate lawyer who resigned from the organizing committee in 1997, after a charge of spousal abuse, was singled out by the Salt Lake City ethics panel for unethical and improper behavior that ranged from handing out cash for I.O.C. votes to setting up an investment fund in which he and Mr. Ganga were to share the benefit. Mr. Welch admits he was free with other people's money. He once spent $30,000 on the street in a single night on Utah Jazz playoff tickets for 30 guests, charging the committee for marketing.
But like Mr. Ganga, he had another side, too. He spent 10 obsessive years trying to bring the Games to Salt Lake City, five of them without taking any pay. And the same ethics report that condemned his actions also conceded that he never tried to enrich himself through the Olympic process; the investment fund with Mr. Ganga existed in name only. In the strange theater of the Olympics, each man had a role. In the letters and faxes that Mr. Welch and Mr. Ganga exchanged, they circled one another, sometimes like adversaries or hagglers, sometimes like friends.
In one 1994 letter to Mr. Welch from his home in Brazzaville, for example, Mr. Ganga wrote of the war that was tearing his country apart. The city was blockaded. Food and medicines were in short supply and Mr. Ganga asked that Mr. Welch try to pressure the United States Government into a formal condemnation of the killings. Money was not mentioned.
Another exchange of letters, in April 1992, was all about money. Mr. Ganga complained that he couldn't afford to fly to Montreal to attend a wedding, and then, after a $4,700 check was sent, wrote back with effusive thanks. "As the saying goes, a friend in need is a friend indeed," Mr. Ganga wrote.
But even if the relationships that formed were simply a cover for the buying and selling of the Olympic Games, real lives were touched, a very human fact that has been buried under the avalanche of embarrassment and anger.
In the mid-1990's, for example, Bob Hunter, the director of community affairs for the bid committee, took in the son of an I.O.C. member from Libya, Suhel Attarabulsi, who had come to the United States to attend college at the bid committee's expense. Mr. Hunter said he made speeches all over the state about Suhel and his life.
"Our family became acquainted with him and fell in love with him," Mr. Hunter said. "He became like our adopted son. He spent Christmas and summer vacations -- we've got his baby picture sitting on the piano in our living room. That's the story I've told all across the state of Utah. That's why it shocks me for people to say we didn't know."
Both Mr. Welch and Mr. Ganga have defended themselves. Mr. Ganga said through a spokesman, Ibrahim Soumare, that he received cash because the banking system in Congo Republic was unreliable, and that the money was sent to various Olympic committees in Africa. Mr. Welch says he was trying to win the bid in the way he had been told it had to be done, but that he was also trying to make a contribution to poorer countries.
Through the filter of money and hindsight, however, it's hard to tell what's real. Mr. Welch, who described Mr. Ganga as a man with "a heart as big as all outdoors," also admitted he was thrilled when the I.O.C. courtship was over.
"You can't imagine the exhilaration I felt when the last member from the last visit was put on the plane," he said. "I subjected myself to more people's pompous outlooks."
 
Unraveling
As Auditors Work, Questions Arise
 The knowledge of what the bid committee was doing in chasing its Olympic bid flowed like a river with no predetermined course -- full of switchbacks and dry washes and dead ends. Information would bubble up from the ground, only to sink again without a trace.
In late July 1995, for example, one month after Salt Lake City had won the Games, auditors from Ernst & Young, who were working on their annual report to close the bid committee's books, came across some puzzling and poorly documented accounting entries. They consequently drew up a list of those expenditures, which totaled $271,000.
The Ernst & Young auditors had pinpointed the very names and amounts that have since become the heart of the Olympic scandal: The so-called National Olympic Committee program. There on their work sheet were cash recipients, including Mr. Ganga and all the I.O.C. scholarship students.
The work papers that the auditors produced as they explored the disbursements also included their handwritten notes, which apparently reflected the information that they were gathering as they tried to determine what the payments had been about. Those notes, which have been given to Federal investigators in the case, indicate that members of both the bid committee's audit committee as well as at least one of its three-member executive committee leaders approved the payments.
"We discussed the N.O.C. program with management, the Audit Committee, and certain members of the Executive Committee," one of the auditors wrote.
"Each individual disbursement is reviewed and approved by the management of the Committee," the auditor concluded.
The people mentioned in the auditors' papers as having been told about the scholarship program in 1995 say they received no such warnings. G. Frank Joklik, the former chairman of the board of trustees, has maintained that he was not aware of wrongdoing; James Beardall, the chairman of the bid committee's audit committee, said he was never notified of any questionable expenditures. "I have no recollection whatsoever of any details of this kind being brought to my attention," Mr. Joklik said of the auditor's report.
Mr. Johnson said that that cannot be.
"Even though it's being denied, we had a powerful committee," he said of his superiors. "They have run major corporations. They are good managers. They required information and justifications about everything we did."
What the work papers clearly reveal, however, is that auditors were satisfied at the time that those people knew, and thus, at least from an accounting standpoint, no one was cutting unauthorized checks.
But still the story stayed locked within bid committee walls.
Ken Bullock, a member of the board of trustees, was the next one to try to break it free. On several occasions beginning in 1995, he said he told the Board of Trustees and Governor Michael O. Leavitt of his concerns. Mr. Bullock said he also complained to the Governor's top aide, Vicki Varela, in 1998 about the scholarships.
"She thought I was a little out there, chasing ghosts," he said.
Sydney Fonnesbeck, a former city council member who worked with Mr. Bullock, recalled his distress at not being listened to, and how he often returned from meetings with the board emotionally "bruised and bloodied."
The Governor, who often participated in public functions with the very people receiving the improper scholarships and other inducements, has said no one came to him with suspicions, and that he would have done something immediately if he had known.
And so there the story appeared to stall again, until June 3, 1997, when a Salt Lake City Council member, Deeda Seed, asked a local television reporter to meet for breakfast at Lamb's, a downtown landmark restaurant. There she told the reporter, Rod Decker of KUTV-Channel 2, that she had been told -- by Mr. Bullock among others -- that children and grandchildren of I.O.C. members were getting college educations paid for by the bid committee.
Mr. Decker, a newsman in Salt Lake City for 27 years, said he would follow up. He said he went to the committee's spokesman, Mike Korologos, and asked if the story was true. Mr. Korologos said he would check it. When he called back, Mr. Decker said Mr. Korologos told him that Mr. Johnson had said there were no scholarships.
He said he was told that some people, including some related to I.O.C. members, had taken a tour of the University of Utah -- that was all. Mr. Decker decided there was no story.
Mr. Johnson has said that he has no memory of the conversation with Mr. Korologos, and Mr. Korologos has declined repeated requests for an interview or comment. But Mr. Decker's call was a knock at the door.
The world was beginning to ask questions and, in retrospect, Mr. Korologos's answer was a tacit acknowledgment that someone within the committee's leadership felt there was something to hide.
Eleven months later, something strange happened in the offices of Ray Quinney & Nebeker, a prominent law firm in Salt Lake City that was the bid committee's legal counsel. Pages of documents -- the minutes of the bid committee's senior management meetings and the handwritten notes of the lawyer who was the committee's secretary for 1994 and 1995 -- were shredded or otherwise destroyed.
The law firm's computer records do not indicate who gave the order to destroy the documents, who carried out the destruction or even how it was done, according to James S. Jardine, the managing director of the firm and the man who had for years served as the bid committee's chief lawyer. But the set of documents -- detailing the committee's actions over the final months of Salt Lake City's quest for the Olympics -- are the only files in that office to have been so destroyed.
"We've interviewed everyone who has worked on it, and their secretaries -- nobody has any knowledge," Mr. Jardine said. "It's strange. It doesn't make sense to us."
Mr. Jardine said the destroyed notes would not have added much to the record of what happened here. But others believe strongly that the notes might have helped make sense of one critical question that has hung over this city and the multiple investigations into the acquisition of the 2002 Games: who among senior management, including some of the city's most prominent and powerful businessmen, knew of the illicit campaign to buy votes?
 
Investigation
Anonymous Source Reveals Corruption
 Someone with access to the committee's files still wanted to get the story out. In late November 1998, a different local television station, KTVX-Channel 4, received a copy of a letter from an anonymous sender. The letter, stamped "draft" on its face, was from Mr. Johnson to an I.O.C. member's daughter, Sonia Essomba, informing her that her next tuition payment would be the last. On Nov. 24, 1998, Channel 4 broke the story, and local newspapers followed up with their own stories about the letter.
Committee officials, in response, portrayed the scholarships as humanitarian, and raised questions about whether the letter might be a forgery. With the letter's authenticity uncertain, the story appeared to fizzle again. But about a week later, in Lausanne, Switzerland, the No. 2 official in the I.O.C., Marc Hodler, said in an apparently offhand remark at a news conference on another subject that he believed Salt Lake City might have paid bribes in winning the 2002 Winter Games. In an interview with National Public Radio on Dec. 10, Mr. Hodler used the word bribes again in front of an American audience.
"From that moment, instead of being perceived as an aberration, it turned into a crisis," Ms. Seed said.
Since then, the story, and the list of questions it has raised, has continued to expand.
Federal prosecutors are trying to determine if anyone broke any laws.
The Salt Lake Organizing Committee has brought in an outsider with Utah roots, W. Mitt Romney, a Boston-based venture capitalist, to head up the Olympic committee with a new pledge of full disclosure.
An independent board of ethics created by Governor Leavitt has determined that knowledge was strictly limited to Mr. Welch, Mr. Johnson, and a third man, Craig Peterson, who the ethics board said acted secretly and alone.
And a lengthening list of people -- from Mr. Welch and Mr. Johnson to other staffers on the committee to officials with the national accounting firm that reviewed the committee's books to the people who served on a panel set up by the United States Olympic Committee -- have said they are not satisfied that the full truth has come out.
Jason Christensen, the volunteer, said he found it almost inconceivable that Mr. Joklik, who took over for Mr. Welch in 1997 to run the daily operations of the committee, did not know of the various mechanisms in place to influence votes.
"I can't imagine him claiming he had zero knowledge of what was going on," Mr. Christensen said. He added, "It was such commonplace knowledge among the staff."
Former Senator Mitchell, the chairman of a special investigation into the Salt Lake City scandal, said he also believes many statements of ignorance "strain credulity." "The actions of the principal individuals were not a secret," he said. "They didn't maintain two sets of books. Everything was available to anyone who inquired."
Still, bid committee officials, and perhaps the most senior members of the I.O.C., apparently thought they might be able to control the extent of the damage. In December, for example, Mr. Johnson, who was called to Switzerland after Mr. Hodler's remarks, said he discussed the trouble with a handful of I.O.C. executive committee members. He then met with Juan Antonio Samaranch, the I.O.C. president.
Of Mr. Samaranch, Mr. Johnson said: "He told me, 'You have a problem; we have a problem; we will get through this.' "
Maybe they will, but they haven't yet. As for the leaked letter that sparked the maelstrom, an ethics panel report last month concluded that it was genuine, but the source still has not been revealed.

Photo/Chart: "The Slippery Slope of Securing an Olympic Bid"
Salt Lake City made its first attempt at hosting the Olympic Winter Games in 1966 for the '72 Games that were ultimately held in Sapporo, Japan. After a lack of success in its early attempts, Salt Lake City made an effort to turn itself into a significant winter vacation destination to become a viable candidate as a host city.
 
30 Years and 5 Attempts
The process to become the host of an Olympic Games is a two-step process for American cities. They must first be named the American bid city. Once that is accomplished, they then compete with inter 2/3nation 2/3al cities. A majority of the approx 2/3imately 100 members of the International Olympic Committee must vote for a city for it to be selected as the host. Salt Lake City has tried to become the host of the Winter Games five times. Here is how the process played out in each of its bids.

HEADLINE: Peace and Poverty in Central America

 BODY:
The last time an American President went to Central America was 1982, when Ronald Reagan visited Honduras and Costa Rica. That year was one of the bloodiest for El Salvador and for Guatemala, where a truth commission recently labeled 1982 as a peak period for what it termed the military's "genocide" of Mayan Indians in the civil war. But Mr. Reagan praised the military leaders of both nations and spent billions in lethal aid to their Governments and the Nicaraguan contras.
This week President Clinton is visiting a very different Central America and carries a very different message. His trip is a belated recognition of the region's progress and importance to the United States. But Washington's support for wars in Central America 15 years ago is not being matched by its support for peace today. 
 In El Salvador and Guatemala, United Nations-sponsored peace agreements have brought former guerrillas into politics and committed the Governments to social reforms. Mayan Indians, the marginalized majority in Guatemala, now serve in Parliament and as local mayors. In El Salvador the party of the former guerrillas lost this week's presidential elections but was able to campaign freely. The Sandinistas in Nicaragua won the war but lost at the ballot box, and stepped down in 1990.
The conflicts are over, but Central America's warring nations have essentially returned to the conditions of misery and inequality that caused the wars to begin with. While El Salvador has experienced steady economic growth, poverty in rural areas remains unchanged. In Nicaragua, the poor are worse off than at its war's end. Huge debts have kept the region from spending money to fight poverty. Nicaragua, for example, pays 11 times more in debt service than it spends on health care each year.
Many of the postwar governments' reforms -- new police or judicial systems -- have not solved the underlying problems that made these bodies responsive mainly to the rich and powerful. Even the local governments admit that free-market changes have so far mainly served the urban wealthy and middle class. Last year the region suffered its worst natural disaster of the century in Hurricane Mitch, which will set back development in Honduras and Nicaragua for decades.
That is why President Clinton's visit, important as it is, is a missed opportunity. Mr. Clinton is doling out his celebrated compassion, but little in the way of money. A billion dollars in post-hurricane aid is being held up in Congress. The Administration should allow the quarter-million immigrants who fled the wars in Salvador and Guatemala to stay in the United States. It must also forgive the debt burdens that were already crippling the countries most devastated by the hurricane, and try to persuade international lending institutions to do the same. Washington spent billions of dollars in the 1980's on wars in Central America. It should now increase its commitment to supporting peace and prosperity.

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS;
2 Big FrenchBanks Rebuff $37 Billion Takeover Offer

BYLINE: By JOHN TAGLIABUE

DATELINE: ROME, March 10

 BODY:
Michel Pebereau thought he would crash the wedding, but the happy couple told him three was a crowd.
In a joint statement, two of France's biggest banks, Paribas S.A. and Societe Generale S.A., said that an offer on Tuesday by their big French rival, Mr. Pebereau's Banque Nationale de Paris, was a "hazardous venture" and that the offer "cannot therefore be considered as a friendly takeover bid." 
 The takeover effort was announced on Tuesday night as Mr. Pebereau, Banque Nationale's chairman, offered $37 billion for the two rivals, which had agreed to merge last month.
At a news conference in Paris this morning, Mr. Pebereau argued that the new European single currency had accelerated consolidation of banking and that the proposed alliance "will allow us to confront the competition on a European level."
Indeed, the alliance would yield a bank whose assets, totaling $1 trillion, would push it past UBS of Switzerland as the world's largest.
"Our country is capable of dominating this sector on a global scale," said Mr. Pebereau, 57, playing the nationalist card. He called banking "a sector in which France has historically excelled."
Stung by the hostile bid, Paribas and Societe Generale promised to study the proposal and then convene their boards. Paribas hired the investment bank Rothschild & Company to study ways to repel the bid, and Societe Generale said it, too, would hire advisers. Trading in the shares of all three banks was suspended in Paris but was expected to resume on Thursday.
For the two target banks, the bid threatens the well-laid plans for Societe Generale to acquire Paribas for $18 billion in stock. Investors have been skeptical of the plan, arguing that there was little overlap at the two banks and that there was scant room for cost-cutting.
For Banque Nationale de Paris, the bid holds great potential. It has been cut out of most French banking deals, and Mr. Pebereau is desperate for a partner. Societe Generale is a well-run bank with a good profit record, and Paribas is a respected name with a strong consumer banking unit, Cetelem.
Yet the move poses great risks. The bid effectively puts all three banks into play, and if Banque Nationale fails, it could fall prey to a takeover. Moreover, it could face resistance from labor unions and the French Government. The bank employees union denounced the plan today as "adventurous and very serious for jobs." For the French Government -- which is preparing a sale of Credit Lyonnais, the state-owned bank that has returned to profit after losing billions -- the proposed combination would create a retail banking giant that would alter the terms of any privatization.
And the bid could face resistance from Jewish organizations. In New York, Elan Steinberg, executive director of the World Jewish Congress, said that if the banks applied for a merger in the United States, a "great deal of sentiment" existed in the leadership of Congress to oppose it until French banks showed a more conciliatory attitude in talks to settle issues related to the accounts of Holocaust victims or their survivors.
The banking alliance that Mr. Pebereau proposed involves keeping all three banks' brand names and includes no sweeping layoffs. Banque Nationale de Paris intends to retain the investment banking activities of Paribas while combining its own banking units with those of Societe Generale.
The merger would create a bank with 4,700 branches in France, giving it 18 percent of the retail market and making it the No. 2 retail bank behind Credit Agricole. The bank said it expected annual savings, before taxes, of $1.3 billion, or 8 percent of combined costs, by 2002.
Elie Cohen, an economist at the National Center for Scientific Research, said: "It's crazy, but Pebereau had no other choice. For him it was a matter of survival." If the bid fails, Mr. Cohen said, Banque Nationale de Paris could find itself the target of a bid from a Dutch or German bank. "If he succeeds, he will be No. 1," he said.
Banque Nationale's bid is the latest in a series of giant-scale transactions that are reshaping European banks as they struggle for position in a market gaining cohesion with the euro. And there is no sign of the pace slackening.
"It's a bold, aggressive step," said John D. Leonard, banking analyst at Salomon Smith Barney in London. He said Banque Nationale wanted to ally itself with Societe Generale, a goal it set last year but failed to achieve when Societe Generale refused an alliance.
Some experts said the real winner, if the deal succeeds, would be Claude Bebear, chairman of the AXA insurance group. AXA is the largest shareholder in both Paribas and Banque Nationale de Paris and would emerge as a controlling shareholder in a combined bank. And Mr. Bebear, 63, a king maker in French finance, is said to want the deal done.

HEADLINE: MOVIE GUIDE

 BODY:

Here is a selective listing by critics of The Times of new or noteworthy movies and film series playing this weekend in New York City. * denotes a highly recommended film or series. Ratings and running times are in parentheses. An index of reviews of films opening today appears on page 8.
 
Now Playing
 
* "AFFLICTION," starring Nick Nolte, James Coburn, Willem Dafoe, Sissy Spacek and Mary Beth Hurt. Directed by Paul Schrader (R, 114 minutes). Mr. Nolte is devastating in the performance of his career, as Wade Whitehouse, a New Hampshire loner fighting a losing battle with demons from his past. Foremost among them: Mr. Coburn, terrifyingly authentic as the drunken, abusive father who long ago cowed his sons into submission. As directed by Mr. Schrader, this pure, unfettered adaptation of Russell Banks's novel starts on a deceptively ordinary note, then escalates into inexorable fury. Every little detail matters. Ms. Spacek and Ms. Hurt expertly play the women who trigger Wade's crisis (Janet Maslin). 

* "ANALYZE THIS," starring Robert De Niro and Billy Crystal. Directed by Harold Ramis (R, 110 minutes). The title, concept and teaming of these co-stars are all funny before the lights go down, so think of this comedy as an offer you can't refuse. Cast as a mobster whose confidence is shaken, Mr. De Niro is hilarious simply by playing his role halfway straight, in classic goodfella style. His mobster finds just the right comic foil in Billy Crystal, as the psychiatrist who utters the immortal: "When I got into family therapy, this wasn't the family I had in mind." There's a lot more where that came from in this breezy comic treat (Maslin).
 
"BLAST FROM THE PAST," starring Brendan Fraser, Christopher Walken, Alicia Silverstone and Sissy Spacek. Directed by Hugh Wilson (PG-13, 105 minutes). More amusingly than might be expected, this comedy tells the story of one very nuclear family that has been hiding in a fallout shelter since 1962 and emerges into a 90's world of grunge and attitude. In fact, it's funnier underground, with Mr. Fraser as the strapping son of a cheerfully mad scientist (Mr. Walken) and sherry-sipping housewife (Ms. Spacek), 1962 style. Once he comes above ground and meets a hard-boiled Ms. Silverstone, it's clear that Mr. Fraser is once again a film's true ingenu, doing the wide-eyed hunk thing that has become his specialty. He does it a lot better in "Gods and Monsters," but this comedy is still lighthearted fun (Maslin).
 
* "CENTRAL STATION," starring Fernanda Montenegro, Vinicius de Oliveira and Marilia Pera. Directed by Walter Salles (R, 115 minutes). In this quiet, luminous Brazilian gem, a joyless older woman crosses paths with an orphaned boy. There's plenty of room for sentimentality here, but the wonder of Mr. Salles's film is all in the telling. As these characters develop a fractious bond, then embark on a road trip that takes them vividly to Brazil's hinterlands in search of the boy's father, Mr. Salles brings great tenderness and surprise to the events that punctuate their journey. Ms. Montenegro's tough bravura performance was one of last year's very best (Maslin).
 
"EIGHT MILLIMETER," starring Nicolas Cage, Joaquin Phoenix, James Gandolfini, Myra Carter and Catherine Keener. Directed by Joel Schumacher (R, 120 minutes). This thriller delves into the perverse underworld of the pornography business, shocking audiences with the realization that sex and violence can be so dull. Mr. Cage, seriously miscast, plays a private detective and devoted family man who is suddenly, to his horror, drawn into the realm of porn. Naturally, this is where the film wanted to be even when its opening scenes were stuck in suburban Pennsylvania. But the story's parade of New York and Hollywood sleazeballs fails to deliver either engaging drama or heartfelt kinks. Mr. Phoenix is scene-stealingly good in a sidekick's role (Maslin).
 
* "LOCK, STOCK AND TWO SMOKING BARRELS," starring Jason Flemyng, Dexter Fletcher, Sting, Jason Statham, Vinnie Jones and Nick Moran. Directed by Guy Ritchie (R, 106 minutes). Not since "The Usual Suspects" has there been such an oversupply of cool macho schemers in a single film. And they're served up with a quick, tart economy that bespeaks the filmmaker's background making videos and commercials -- actually an advantage, for a change. There's not much beneath the surface here; what's most entertaining is Mr. Ritchie's droll, hard-boiled storytelling and the rogue's gallery of a cast that he has assembled. All the film need do is juggle assorted miscreants and four separate gangs who, figuratively speaking, can't shoot straight (Maslin).
 
"MESSAGE IN A BOTTLE," starring Kevin Costner, Robin Wright Penn and Paul Newman. Directed by Luis Mandoki (PG-13, 110 minutes). Nicholas Sparks's best-selling novel, about a lonely, sensitive man who sends a message out to sea and the lonely, beautiful woman who finds it, is now a long and soggy film. Kevin Costner crosses the line from teasingly laconic to stodgy and seems as likely to have written "Bleak House" as the love letter in question. Robin Wright Penn makes an appealing heroine, but there's not much room for real emotion in a film with the tenor of a commercial for hazelnut-flavored coffee. As the hero's crusty old father, Mr. Newman steals what's left of the show (Maslin).
 
"MY FAVORITE MARTIAN," starring Christopher Lloyd, Jeff Daniels and Ray Walston. Directed by Donald Petrie (PG, 88 minutes). Pixilated pixels and other up-to-the-minute moviemaking magic manage the neat feat of turning the big-screen, resurrected "My Favorite Martian" into an amiable family entertainment. In this updated version of the 1960's CBS sitcom, Jeff Daniels as Tim O'Hara (now a television newsman rather than a newspaper reporter) and Christopher Lloyd as the visitor from another planet take over the roles played by Bill Bixby and Ray Walston. In one of the happy and logical little jokes that lend a disarming charm to the comedy, Mr. Walston turns up once again in a welcome guise as Government bloodhounds set out to capture the Martian. But a good deal of the fun in this tale is provided by Zoot, his high-spirited polymorphic space suit (Lawrence Van Gelder).
 
"OCTOBER SKY," starring Jake Gyllenhaal, Chris Cooper, Chris Owen and Natalie Canaday. Directed by Joe Johnston (PG, 100 minutes). By far the most moving scenes here are home movie snippets, circa 1957, that show the real people on whom the film's characters are based. Otherwise, despite being closely based on a best-selling memoir ("Rocket Boys") by the NASA engineer Homer H. Hickam Jr., this earnest, nostalgic film has a way of seeming too good to be true. The film's simplicity is appealing, as is Mr. Gyllenhaal in the central role of a boy in a West Virginia coal mining town who becomes obsessed with rocketry. But the story, filled with father-son conflict and down-in-the-ground versus up-in-the-sky contrasts, often follows a familiar trajectory (Maslin).
 
"PAYBACK," starring Mel Gibson and Gregg Henry. Directed by Brian Helgeland (R, 110 minutes). In this inept, excessively sadistic film-noir spoof adapted from the same Richard Stark novel ("The Hunter") that inspired the 1967 genre classic "Point Blank," Mr. Gibson is a thief named Porter who retaliates with a vengeance after an attempt on his life. Determined to recover $70,000 that was stolen from him by a double-crossing partner in crime, he works his way up the pecking order of a crime syndicate, brutally dispatching all who stand in his way. The hard-boiled dialogue is ludicrous, the storytelling clunky, the acting fair to awful, the gore ankle deep. Credit the star with being able to keep a straight face through this loathsome mess (Stephen Holden).
 
* "SHAKESPEARE IN LOVE," starring Joseph Fiennes, Gwyneth Paltrow, Geoffrey Rush, Ben Affleck and Judi Dench. Directed by John Madden (R, 113 minutes). A witty, sexy and merrily literate delight, with an exhilaratingly clever premise that only gets better as the film unfolds. The screenplay, originating as Marc Norman's brainstorm and turned by Tom Stoppard into razor-sharp dialogue reminiscent of his "Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead," dares to imagine whatever it likes about the link between Shakespeare's artistic passions and his mad yearning for a certain aristocratic beauty. Meanwhile this tirelessly inventive comedy envisions an Elizabethan theater fraught with the same backbiting and conniving we enjoy today and has great fun presenting the creation of "Romeo and Juliet," glitches and all. Mr. Fiennes and Ms. Paltrow make a fine, tempestuous duo, and she gives the first great, fully realized starring performance of her career (Maslin).
 
* "TANGO," starring Miguel Angel Sola. Written and directed by Carlos Saura. Cinematography by Vittorio Storaro (PG-13, 100 minutes). A thrilling display of tango heat and virtuosity. And it's no slight to the actors who play lovers to say that the dancing here is steamier than any kiss. In his most electrifying dance film Mr. Saura offers transfixingly beautiful glimpses of the dance and the great range of emotions it can conjure. Mr. Storaro's dazzlingly fluid cinematography captures all the nuances this material demands. Everyone in the film is utterly consumed by tango fever; audiences will be, too (Maslin).
 
"THE THIN RED LINE," starring Jim Caviezel, Ben Chaplin, Nick Nolte, Sean Penn and Woody Harrelson. Directed by Terrence Malick (R, 166 minutes). From the first frame of this huge, drifting war epic loosely derived from James Jones's Guadalcanal novel, it's viscerally clear that Mr. Malick is back. The exquisite, oddly detached visual style that made "Badlands" and "Days of Heaven" the most beautiful films of the 1970's is instantly apparent here, even if the narrative vagueness and brooding voice-overs are also familiar. The film sprawls, gets lost and occasionally delivers visual poetry, the kind that could have been greatly helped by tighter editing. Bottom line: No one who admired Mr. Malick's early work should miss this. But those expecting anything simple will not find it here (Maslin).
 
"20 DATES," starring Myles Berkowitz. Directed by Mr. Berkowitz (R, 88 minutes). The filmmaker's gimmick is to make a film about dating. His goal: To go out with 20 different women, get them on camera by any means necessary and promise to fall in love with one before the experiment is over. Mr. Berkowitz, pesty and proud of it, has absorbed enough of Jerry Seinfeld and Garry Shandling to create a diffident, nit-picking, sitcom-ready persona. But whenever his film establishes a playful mood, it's liable to do something to make you squirm. Crassness and mock candor aren't all that funny (unless they're coming from Albert Brooks, whose "Real Life" paved the way for this). And discovering that cheese makes Mr. Berkowitz constipated, or that one of his dates disappoints him by not looking enough like Jessica Rabbit, is more than you need to know (Maslin).
 
"200 CIGARETTES," starring Paul Rudd, Kate Hudson, Ben Affleck, Janeane Garofalo and Courtney Love. Directed by Risa Bramon Garcia (R, 102 minutes). This contrived but cheery party movie marks the feature directing debut of a well-known casting director. And in making her film, Ms. Garcia does what she does best: cast. A group of bright young players is brought together for a largely plotless New Year's Eve, rambling around a colorfully evoked East Village, circa 1981. Essentially just a set of interwoven skits, this comedy still makes good use of the actors noted above, along with Casey Affleck as a nice-guy punk, Dave Chappelle as a cabbie full of advice and Martha Plimpton as a hopeless hostess. Ms. Hudson, who is Goldie Hawn's daughter and has her mother's grin and giggle, makes an adorable debut despite spending part of the movie with dog excrement on her coat (Maslin).
 
Film Series
 
RICHARD LESTER RETROSPECTIVE. Hip, free-wheeling and blessed with an irreverent comic spirit, Richard Lester burst on the filmmaking scene in 1959 with "The Running, Jumping, Standing Still Film," an 11-minute short with Peter Sellers and Spike Milligan. In the 1960's, Mr. Lester made "A Hard Day's Night" and "Help!" both starring the Beatles, as well as "The Knack. . . and How to Get It" and "How I Won the War," with John Lennon. Now Mr. Lester is the subject of a retrospective at the American Museum of the Moving Image that concludes this weekend with four of his films. The attractions tomorrow are "The Bed Sitting Room" (1969), with Rita Tushingham, Milligan, Peter Cook and Dudley Moore, at 2 P.M; and the autumnal romance "Robin and Marian" (1976) with Sean Connery and Audrey Hepburn at 4:30. Sunday brings not only "Petulia" (1968) at 2 P.M. and "A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum" (1966) at 4 but also discussions after each by Tony Walton, who designed the films for the director. Admission to the series at the museum, 34-12 36th Street, at 35th Avenue, Astoria, Queens, is $8.50 for adults, $5.50 for people over 65 and students with I.D., $4.50 for children from 5 to 18 and free to children under 4. Information: (718) 784-0077 (Van Gelder).

The D.J. Apostles Of Rock 'n' Roll

BYLINE: By Peter M. Nichols 

 BODY:
Documentaries often make the better shows on video. On March 23, for example, Winstar is to release "Rock 'n' Roll Invaders," a Canadian film that goes past the performers to get at the AM radio disk jockeys who brought the music to the people in the 50's. 
 Produced by Dramarama, a Toronto company, the documentary took its director, Paul Eichgrun, around the United States on a three-year search for material about a little band of visionaries who sensed an impending revolution and spun every record they could get their hands on.
Postwar America was nervous about race and its increasingly restless teen-agers. "Kids were becoming an economic power, buying their own cars and clothes and records," Mr. Eichgrun said. "It was a shock."
But race was the sore point. The documentary is especially good at showing how disk jockeys helped move the music that became rock 'n' roll from black to white in the middle and latter part of the decade.
Several years earlier radio itself had been revitalized by black rhythm-and-blues, spread far and wide by the likes of Rufus Thomas and Martha Jean (The Queen) Steinberg, black disk jockeys on WDAI in Memphis (later she went to Detroit). Soon rhythm-and-blues met white rockabilly, introducing white disk jockeys like Dewey Phillips, the man with Beale Street connections, John R. (John Richbourg) and Bill (Hoss) Allen of WLAC in Nashville.
The music worked its way north, and in places like the Record Rendezvous in Cleveland, white teen-agers combed "sepia bins" for the hot, sweaty, boozy workingman's rhythm-and-blues. At Alan Freed's Moondog Ball, the first rock concert, a crowd of 26,000 tried to occupy 6,000 seats and there was a riot.
The rambunctious Freed ruled the scene, and the white mainstream was getting anxious. Rhythm-and-blues was about to become a white creation. "They bleached it and changed the name," Mr. Eichgrun said. Now it was rock 'n' roll and headed for the coasts.
There was trouble. Freed was on WINS in New York and promoting concerts around the East. "Kids, it looks like the Boston police don't want you to have fun," he told a packed crowd in Boston Arena. That got him indicted for inciting a riot and cost him his job at WINS. ABC television hired him, but he lost that job, too, when the black singer Frankie Lyman danced with a white girl. The show was instantly canceled.
Middle America wasn't amused when Jerry Lee Lewis married his 13-year-old second cousin. The payola scandals, with many leading disk jockeys caught taking money to play records, were no help either. "Booze, Broads, Bribes," shouted a headline about a riotous disk jockey convention in Miami. Station management introduced the Top 40, which were played over and over.
Disk jockeys responded by becoming performers in their own right. At the Apollo Theater in New York, Jocko Henderson gave songs rhymed introductions that were the forerunners of rap. In Mexico, Wolfman Jack ruled border radio, the one-million-watt stations heard all over the country and beyond. "The Russians had to spend time blocking out the Wolfman," Mr. Eichgrun said.

Variable Transmission Wins New Disciples

BYLINE: By MICHELLE KREBS 

DATELINE: DETROIT

 BODY:
WHILE driving the Honda Civic HX coupe, one immediately senses that something is missing. Step hard on the accelerator when a stoplight turns green, or press the pedal to the floor to pass on a freeway, and there is no jerk as the transmission shifts gears. Nor does the sound of the engine rise just before a shift, along with its speed, and then fall off. The tachometer's needle holds steady.
Indeed, the car feels as though its transmission is not shifting at all. 
 That is because the Civic HX has a continuously variable transmission, or CVT, the only one currently available on a production model in the United States. It will certainly not be the last.
Last fall, the Ford Motor Company and ZF Friedrichshafen A.G., the German company that is Europe's largest supplier of transmissions, announced a joint venture that is expected to eventually produce a million CVT's a year at a Ford transmission plant in Batavia, Ohio. The transmissions will show up in cars from Ford and from other manufacturers.
The appeal of CVT's is simple. Aside from their smoothness, they allow an engine to operate at optimal efficiency nearly all the time, improving economy and saving wear and tear. They offer the convenience of an automatic transmission with the better mileage of a manual shift. Indeed, the Civic HX has been the only car without a stick shift to earn a place on the Environmental Protection Agency's list of the 10 mileage leaders, achieving a rating of 34 miles a gallon in the city and 38 on the highway.
"The customer gets improved fuel economy because the vehicle spends more time in areas of good efficiency," said Gordon Willis, Ford's chief engineer for automatic transmissions. Although gasoline prices are now around their all-time lows, Mr. Willis concedes that fuel economy will matter again someday. And global giants like Ford are already building plenty of cars for countries where fuel economy is indeed important because gasoline is very expensive.
Ford and ZF expect their new CVT to raise fuel economy by 10 to 15 percent. In addition to better mileage, the customer has the benefit of feeling and hearing no gear changes. "Every transmission causes you to feel the gear change to some degree, and customers say they would rather not feel those events," Mr. Willis said. "They worry about those events if they feel they are not always shifting exactly the same -- if it shifts different today than it did yesterday."
In fact, while a driver perceives that a CVT-equipped car is not shifting at all, it is actually shifting much of the time, though not in the specific increments of a traditional transmission. Shifts on a car with an automatic transmission are based on specific ratios between the speed of the engine and the speed of the vehicle. First gear is one ratio, and second, third and fourth gears are others; there are no possible settings between the gears. As a result, the engine is sometimes operating extremely efficiently, and sometimes quite inefficiently.
But a CVT shifts continuously as the engine speed and vehicle speed change, allowing an infinite number of possible gear ratios. ZF executives say this should result in less strain on the engine and longer life for other vehicle components.
Honda's CVT works like the gearing on the two sprocket rings of a 10-speed bicycle. Computerized sensors constantly adjust the diameters of pulleys -- the drive pulley from the engine and the driven pulley that sends power to the wheels -- at each end of a steel drive belt, pushing the belt closer or farther away from the center of each pulley. Every possible position of the belt on the two pulleys represents a gear ratio. On acceleration, for instance, the drive pulley will have a narrow diameter for more torque, like a low gear. At cruising speed, the drive pulley widens and acts like a high gear.
CVT's are not new. The earliest automobiles operated on a similar principle, and a Dutch car, the DAF, had a CVT in the years after World War II, using sturdy drive belts developed for such a purpose by a Dutch company, Van Doorne's Transmissie B.V. In the United States, Subaru offered a CVT on its Justy subcompact in the early 1990's. And CVT's are used in foreign markets on several Nissan Motor models, including the diesel Micra sold in Europe; on the Microcar of France, and on other vehicles. Snowmobiles have always used CVT's.
But while CVT's have been mainly used in small cars with small engines, that seems likely to change. University of Michigan studies of automotive trends predict rapid growth for CVT's in the next decade because of increased pressure on auto makers to raise fuel economy, in part because their brisk sales of low-mileage vehicles reduces their corporate fuel-economy averages.
The Ford and ZF joint venture is a big step toward the proliferation of CVT's. The first transmission from that venture will make its debut on a 2002 model; company officials said that would not be a Ford product, though Ford will not be far behind.
Technical issues are the focus of much attention. Improved materials, larger belts and better control systems should help make CVT's practical with larger engines. ZF has introduced a CVT aimed at engines of up to 3 liters. And Nissan is working on what it calls a toroidal CVT, which does not use belts. That CVT has been tested with a potent 300-horsepower engine.
Low volume and limited availability of parts have made CVT's expensive to produce, though Mr. Willis of Ford predicts that they could prove cheaper than traditional automatics as production increases, because they contain fewer parts.
"I'm convinced the technical benefits of the CVT will make it the dominant form of transmission," Mr. Willis said. "The speculation now is how long will it take?"

HEADLINE: ON STAGE AND OFF;
Numbers Beat the 'Band'

BYLINE: By Jesse McKinley 

 BODY:
It may not be the worst decision of the season. (Remember "More to Love"?) But the booking of "Band in Berlin" in the Helen Hayes Theater on Broadway over the acclaimed drama "Wit" is looking more and more suspect.
For those just tuning in, last fall the owner of the Helen Hayes, Martin Markinson, opted to book "Band in Berlin," a musical based on a Nazi-era singing group, over "Wit," which was earning stellar reviews in a small theater Off Off Broadway. His reasoning, he said, was that the subject matter of "Wit," a literature professor's battle with ovarian cancer, was not appetizing to audiences. 
 Spurned, "Wit" subsequently reopened on Jan. 7 in the Union Square Theater, an Off Broadway house that, with 499 seats, is the same size as the Helen Hayes but that is not Tony eligible. The move has been a rousing success. This week the producers of "Wit" announced they had earned back the $500,000 it cost to mount the show and were making approximately $58,000 a week in profit. Average weekly grosses have been running about $142,000, out of a potential $168,000, said Roy Gabay, the show's general manager.
Meanwhile, at the Helen Hayes the producers of "Band in Berlin," which opened on Sunday to dismissive reviews, reported sales of a meager $66,283 last week. But Robert V. Straus, the lead producer, said the figure was low in part because on opening night most seats are given free to the press, investors, friends and others.
Mr. Straus said he was giving the show two to five weeks to build an audience. "If we're at $60,000 in three weeks," he said, "you know what we're going to have to do."
Mr. Markinson said: "I'm very happy for 'Wit,' but I come from a place where I never look back. To me that's negative energy. Would I have made the same choice? Probably. But I simply don't allow myself to take a whip out and beat myself."
 
Putting It Together
Cameron Mackintosh was in New York this week laying the groundwork for what promises to be a coming onslaught on Broadway.
Mr. Mackintosh, the producer of commercial behemoths like "Les Miserables" and "Miss Saigon," spent most days casting for "Martin Guerre," his oft-reworked musical, which will open in Minneapolis in September and then tour. It is aiming for Broadway in spring 2000.
But in his spare time -- and there wasn't much -- he turned his attention to several other shows. The first is "Putting It Together," a Stephen Sondheim revue, which now looks likely for the Barrymore Theater in September or October. Mr. Mackintosh dined with Mr. Sondheim on Tuesday night.
Mr. Mackintosh also was discussing his forthcoming revival of "Oliver," which will probably try out in Toronto, Chicago and possibly Boston before landing in New York in early spring. Audra McDonald and Geoffrey Rush have been mentioned for roles; a spokesman for Mr. Mackintosh, Marc Thibodeau, said he could not confirm any negotiations.
 
Straight Up
If any more proof were needed of this season's strange economic logic, consider this: The only real moneymakers have been straight plays.
Heading the pack last fall was "The Blue Room," which sold out a three-month run and returned a tidy $2 million profit, and "Electra," which will conclude a four-month run on March 21 about $400,000 in the black. The spring's first major opening, "Death of a Salesman," has also put up good numbers, regularly selling out and building a $3.5 million advance.
And more winners may be on the way. Emmanuel Azenberg, the producer of "The Iceman Cometh," opening in April, said this week that advance sales of his show would very likely top $4.4 million this week. Producers of "Amy's View," another April entry, declined to say what their advance was, but a member of the production who had seen sales figures said they were "Blue Room-like."
By contrast, of the season's musical offerings, only "Annie Get Your Gun" and "Fosse" are showing any real box-office vigor. "Footloose," which has had good weeks and bad, has slipped of late.
 
Filling 'Follies'
The cast of the Encores concert series's next show, "The Ziegfeld Follies of 1936," opening on March 25, will include two alumni of the musical "Chicago": Karen Ziemba, who is in the current New York production, and Ruthie Henshall, who was nominated for an Olivier Award for "Chicago" in London. "Ziegfeld"s cast also includes Christine Ebersole, Peter Scolari and Mary Testa. Ms. Henshall looks likely to join the New York "Chicago" in May, playing the role of Velma opposite Sandy Duncan.
 
'Dreaming Out Loud'
When Deidre Murray, composer of the music for "Running Man," first proposed a performance piece about her brother's heroin addiction to her collaborator, Cornelius Eady, he thought the concept was slightly unwieldy.
"It would have had to be an opera," said Mr. Eady, recalling Ms. Murray's original 20-page outline. "With a cast of thousands."
Ms. Murray said, "I wanted to do a homage to people who never make it." Her brother, Wellington, died in 1991. "He fell and kept falling," she said.
But over the course of two years the piece was whittled down into a 75-minute, jazz-infused piece, playing now through Sunday at the Here performance space in SoHo.
"Running Man," which has received some critical praise and subsequent attention from commercial producers, was commissioned by the Music-Theater Group. Lyn Austin, the producing director of the group, said negotiations were under way to reopen in a larger theater this spring.
Neither Mr. Eady nor Ms. Murray is accustomed to working in the theater. Ms. Murray is an accomplished jazz cellist; Mr. Eady is a poet.
But both seem to be enjoying their excursion. "Theater is kind of like dreaming out loud, " Mr. Eady said. "I think I'm hooked."

HEADLINE: ART REVIEW;
The Modern Looks at Artists Looking at Museums

BYLINE: By ROBERTA SMITH 

 BODY:
Of all the love-hate relationships that roil the art world, none is more fraught or more stimulating than that between artists and museums. This makes perfect sense, since the two occupy opposite ends of the art world food chain.
Artists make art; museums select some of that art for their collections, where it is preserved, elevated and, most of all, displayed. Once on view, it offers other artists inspiration, helping them unlock their own talents, which brings the food chain full circle. 
 The artist-museum relationship could be called capitalist, a case of supply and demand, with the consumer (the museum) causing pain and competition among the producers (the artists). It could be called Oedipal, with the museum as a parental authority whose ordering, judgmental nature is anathema to the rebellious sensibilities of artists, even though they crave its approval. Or it could be seen as micro versus macro: artists are individuals and museums are institutions, but they are driven by a similar passion for the accumulation, enjoyment and perpetuation of art. The similarities and differences create a perfectly balanced mutual fascination.
Whatever it's called, this connection powers "Museum as Muse: Artists Reflect," a remarkable exhibition that opens on Sunday at the Museum of Modern Art. Organized by Kynaston McShine, the longtime senior curator in the department of painting and sculpture, it examines the many ways that artists, mostly in the 20th century, have seen the museum as the subject, rather than simply the destination, of their art.
This tendency has been on the rise since the advent of Conceptual Art, when artists became more aware and critical of the complex context -- ethical, social, economic -- surrounding art. But the show also includes a handful of works from previous centuries, suggesting that the fascination predates modernism. Its 62 artists range from Roger Fenton (the 19th-century photographer) to Marcel Duchamp and Joseph Cornell, to Hans Haacke, Ed Ruscha, Sherrie Levine and Fred Wilson. Janet Cardiff, a young Canadian artist, has created the show's amusingly disorienting audio guide, which takes the viewer into the Modern's permanent collection and beyond.
Although it is stronger in big ideas than in profound visual experiences, "Museum as Muse" is an unusually coherent, well-orchestrated theme show that transcends typical theme-show fare (as in the cow, nude or machine in art). Part of its power lies in the simple fact that, to paraphrase Frank Stella, what you see is where you see it. Its contents and its context are one.
Including painting, video, printed brochure and installation art, the show's 182 works mix media with a freedom that's unusual for the Modern, while veering pleasantly between the arcane and the accessible, the beautiful and the thought-provoking, the celebratory and the critical. The totality examines the museum from every angle, as a public place, as an accumulator and classifier of knowledge (natural history museums are also touched on), as a colonizer of cultures (so are ethnographic ones), as an exclusive social club and as a big business with products of its own.
Almost in passing, interrelated smaller themes are encompassed. The show offers an unusually comprehensible outline of the development of Conceptual Art, with its emphasis on language and photography and its influences on subsequent generations. It reflects how photography especially has metastasized throughout the art of the last 30 years. And, of course, by definition it also considers one of 20th-century art's biggest ideas: the site-specific work of art. This is, after all, an exhibition of art about art museums in the world's pre-eminent museum of modern art. For contemporary artists, a site can't be much richer with possibility.
This is nowhere clearer than in the works, like Ms. Cardiff's audio guide, that Mr. McShine commissioned specially for the show. The results are impressive, not least because they show the Modern being very flexible, uncharacteristically so, some would say. The museum clearly bent the furthest for a piece by the California Conceptualist Michael Asher: a brochure listing, as accurately as records permit, every work of painting and sculpture that the Modern has ever deaccessioned. Attached to one of the benches toward the end of the exhibition, it makes fascinating reading and is also available in the Modern's bookstore without charge (but with a museum ticket stub).
The French artist Daniel Buren, famous for reducing art to bright stripes that he applies to all kinds of surfaces, has been allowed to put his stripes not in the show proper but upstairs in the permanent collection galleries. To be precise, they appear on two walls that usually hold four paintings by Giorgio de Chirico. Meanwhile, the de Chirico paintings are on view in Mr. McShine's exhibition, where they provide an encounter as pleasantly surprising as Mr. Buren's walls of stripes upstairs.
And Mr. Wilson was given free rein in the Modern's photo archive, emerging with "Art in Our Time," a wall of images that evoke the museum as a bastion of the rich and white. The central image shows the museum "opened up," after a fire in 1958, with the windows of its famous stairwell knocked out by firefighters. It is typical of the exhibition that Mr. Wilson's work faces a more traditional arrangement, photographs of museum openings by Garry Winogrand and Larry Fink, which also don't always flatter the powers that be.
Mr. McShine rather slyly includes an earlier instance of flexibility at the Modern, in a work that was created for "Information," his 1970 survey of Conceptual Art. Titled "Service Piece," it is by Vito Acconci and documents the artist using his allotted space in the earlier show as a mail pickup. (Other "Information" alumni include Mr. Buren, Jan Dibbets, Mr. Haacke, Robert Smithson, Dennis Oppenheim and, surprisingly, Jeff Wall.)
Installed with the density of an 18th-century kunstkammer -- the collections of art, artifacts and natural wonders assembled by monarchs and aristocrats that is the point of origin of museums -- the show nonetheless moves easily from one idea to the next, while individual works play off each other well. Organizationally, it lures viewers in, saves its more difficult works for the middle and then sets them down gently.
The show's long narrow antechamber, as the first gallery might be called, concentrates on the museum as a public space that foments private experience, a stage whose social and visual dynamics have always attracted artists. Most of the works are photographs, and most of them show people looking at art. In Thomas Struth's enormous images -- almost big enough to walk into -- people gaze at the Modern's big Pollock, "One: No. 31, 1950," or at Gericault's looming "Raft of the Medusa" at the Louvre.
Across the way, Cartier-Bresson's "Musee du Louvre," with its clutch of people studying David's looming painting of the coronation of the Emperess Josephine, is surely an ancestor to the Struths. David Seymour shows Bernard Berenson contemplating a marble odalisque with self-satisfied calm, while Cartier-Bresson photographs two small boys avidly homing in on a sculpture in a museum in Tashkent. Elliott Erwitt and Eve Arnold capture the sexual puns in chance juxtapositions of viewers and objects, and Candida Hofer's photographs of modern museum lobbies reveal antiseptic spaces devoid of art or people. A short wall of 19th-century photographs by Fenton, Gustave LeGray and Charles Thurston Thompson underscores the point that photographers sought out museums and their contents as soon as the camera was invented.
Next, Charles Willson Peale, the 18th-century portrait painter who was also an inventor, zoologist and engraver, literally raises the curtain on the show. In a large 1822 self-portrait he unveils America's first museum, which he founded, a place where stuffed birds and painted portraits are overwhelmingly abundant. Gathering, selecting and classifying -- the museum's chief functions -- are the themes here, adapted by artists to their own purposes. Sometimes the result is highly personal, a museum of the self, the soul or the artist's work. Examples include Cornell's "Untitled (Bebe Marie)," a suitcase full of cards, photographs and illustrations forming a tender, obsessive dossier, and the various boxes that Duchamp filled with miniature replicas of his art, creating portable retrospectives. Herbert Distel's "Museum of Drawers," created in the 1970's, contains miniatures of and by other artists, 500 of them. Barbara Bloom's "Reign of Narcissism" is a portrait of the artist as demure museum display, while Christian Boltanski's "Vitrine of Reference (II)" from 1970 recalls his childhood in a series of pathetic little artifacts.
And not only art is gathered. Mark Dion amasses animal, vegetable and mineral specimens in "Chain of Being," a bookshelf-as-cornucopia and one of the show's commissions. Hiroshi Sugimoto's eerie photographs of natural history dioramas suggest how this material is put to use. And Susan Hiller's "From the Freud Museum" preserves valueless, meaningless little objects and texts, assembled into 50 separate boxes in juxtapositions that set off all sorts of bells concerning history, myth and memory. The only thing missing here is Claes Oldenburg's fabulous "Mouse Museum," a walk-in room in the shape of Mickey's head that is in fact a portrait of the Pop artist's fertile imagination and his omnivorous interest in popular culture. Too big for the exhibition, it is in the museum's lobby, along with works by Allan McCollum and the Canadian artist-team General Idea.
In the show's middle section, the museum is not so much imitated as scrutinized, with particular attention to the artwork as commodity and stolen property. Duchamp is back with his defaced reproduction of the Mona Lisa. Mr. Haacke traces the provenance of the small version of Seurat's "Poseuses" from the artist's studio in 1888 to the vaults of an investment group nearly 90 years later. Sophie Calle's "Last Seen . . ." series dwells upon another sort of transaction, the theft of three paintings from Boston's Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum. Lothar Baumgarten's slide projection piece "Unsettled Objects" considers a more extensive form of theft, with images of the non-Western art and artifacts warehoused in the Pitt Rivers Museum, an ethnographic museum in Oxford, England. These dense-packed displays, untouched for most of this century, are as disturbing as they are riveting.
Such cultural presumption echoes in Andrea Fraser's "Welcome to the Wadsworth Atheneum: A Museum Tour," a 1991 videotape that never gets to the art, instead reviewing the historical matrix of prominent individuals and families who created the city and provided the museum with art, patrons, wings, architects and even the occasional director or curator.
In the exhibition's final gallery, the end of the museum is broached with a lightness that suggests that reports of its death are greatly exaggerated. A 1966 painting by Mr. Ruscha shows the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, built over the La Brea Tar Pits, on fire. A maquette by Christo shows the Modern under wraps, and Komar and Melamid's paintings depict it and the Guggenheim in ruins. Quietly optimistic, Mr. Wall's illuminated Cibachrome image "Restoration" shows a panoramic history painting of the Franco-Prussian War being tended to by a team of conservators.
The last work in this rewarding exhibition is also the oldest, Hubert Robert's late-18th-century oil study for an imaginary scene of the Louvre's Grand Galerie in ruins. Like the large version, this work is in the Louvre's collection, making it an early instance of site-specific art. As such, it marks the beginning of a very fruitful relationship.
"Museum as Muse: Artists Reflect" opens on Sunday at the Museum of Modern Art, 11 West 53d Street, Manhattan, and remains there through June 1.

HEADLINE: U.S. Deficit for 1998 Shatters the Old Record

BYLINE: Reuters 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 11

 BODY:
The deficit in the broadest measure of United States trade soared to a record in 1998 as exports sagged in the midst of a sharp slowdown in the global economy, the Government said today.
The current-account deficit swelled last year by $78.23 billion, to a record $233.45 billion, the Commerce Department reported. The previous record was $168 billion, set in 1987. 
 But the gap narrowed in the final three months last year, with its first quarterly drop in a year and a half.
It totaled $63.77 billion in the fourth quarter, down from $65.69 billion in the third quarter.
Still, the fourth-quarter deficit was larger than the $59.7 billion gap many economists had expected.
The current account measures trade in merchandise and services as well as investment flows between countries.
Exports last year suffered as crises in Asia and many emerging economies depressed demand for goods and services from the United States. But as the domestic economy proved surprisingly robust despite turmoil elsewhere, consumers snapped up cheaper goods from abroad, causing imports to soar.
Some of the current-account improvement at the end of last year resulted from a huge inflow of capital into United States stock and bond markets as nervous global investors fled turbulence elsewhere and sought a haven in the United States.
Total capital inflows increased nearly twofold, to $183.1 billion, in the fourth quarter from $98.7 billion in the third quarter. Net foreign purchases of United States bonds totaled $24.3 billion, compared with $1.4 billion in the third quarter. Net purchases of stocks grew to $8.3 billion from $5.5 billion.

HEADLINE: Retail Sales in U.S. Climbed For Seventh Consecutive Month

BYLINE: Reuters 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 11

 BODY:
Consumers went on a spending spree in February, snapping up new cars, clothing and furniture, the Government said today in a report showing a still-vigorous expansion despite a weak global economy.
The Commerce Department said total retail sales jumped nine-tenths of a percent, to a seasonally adjusted $236.47 billion, after a 1 percent rise in January. The January figure was revised upward steeply from the previously reported two-tenths of a percent gain. 
 February marked the seventh consecutive month in which retail sales grew, adding powerful momentum to a nearly eight-year-old expansion since the last recession ended in March 1991.
The release of the data helped fuel a powerful rally on Wall Street into record territory as dealers saw the retail figures reinforcing other recent upbeat news on the economy.
Some analysts said robust spending might make Federal Reserve officials uneasy about potential price rises, but only moderately so, since other gauges of activity show only muted inflation.
"The real issue here is whether we may be seeing the last bunch of really strong numbers on the economy, as I think we might," said Robert Dederick, economic consultant to the Northern Trust Company in Chicago.
In a separate report, the Labor Department also reported on jobless benefit claims, which rose only a scant 1,000, to 289,000 in the week ended Saturday. The weekly figures have been under 300,000 for six consecutive weeks, indicating plenty of jobs in the world's largest economy.
Every major category of goods posted sales increases last month. Auto-dealer sales, which account for one-quarter of retail business, climbed 1.8 percent, to $59.38 billion, after a seven-tenths of a percent rise in January. Even excluding automobiles, February retail sales increased six-tenths of a percent after a 1.1 percent surge in January.
Sales of building materials climbed 1.2 percent, to $15 billion, following a 1.6 percent increase in January and general merchandise stores posted a half a percent gain in business, to $31.23 billion, after a 2.6 percent jump in January.
Clothing-store sales grew by 1 percent last month, to $10.92 billion, after a huge 3.7 percent increase in January. Even gasoline sales increased, despite generally lower prices, with February sales growing by eight-tenths of a percent, to $12.51 billion, reversing a three-tenths of a percent decline in January.

Resignationof German Official Pushes Euro Up Against the Dollar

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
The euro rose against the dollar yesterday as traders said that the resignation of the German Finance Minister, Oskar Lafontaine, would ease the economic change that Europe needs to revive growth.
"This is just what the euro needed," said Maureen MacFarland, who helps manage $1 billion at the MacKay Shields Financial Corporation and who recently bought euros. "It's good news because it means a shift from center-left policies to a more responsible stance as far as capital markets are concerned." 
 In New York, the euro rose to $1.1023, from $1.0940 on Wednesday. Still, the single currency is down almost 6 percent since its introduction on Jan. 1, with some citing their expectation of slowing growth in the 11-nation euro zone.
The dollar's decline against the euro drove it down against the Japanese yen, taking it to 119.33 yen, from 119.88 on Wednesday. Earlier, the dollar rose as high as 121.08 yen amid speculation that Japan opposes the yen's 2.5 percent gain over the last week because it hurts efforts to revive its economy.
A German Government statement gave no reason for the departure by Mr. Lafontaine, who also quit as chairman of the governing Social Democratic Party. His decision followed a report in the newspaper Die Welt that Chancellor Gerhard Schroder threatened to resign at a Cabinet meeting. A Government spokesman denied the report.
Central bankers had complained that Mr. Lafontaine's repeated lobbying for a cut in the European Central Bank's benchmark interest rate, now at 3 percent, undermined the bank's independence, possibly leading the bankers to dig in their heels.
"You get rid of somebody that isn't considered a free-market thinker and that's good for the euro," said Bob Lynch, a currency strategist at Paribas. "Traders didn't like the Socialist side of his policies, which emphasized government involvement in markets."

HEADLINE: Residential Real Estate;
Condominium Developers Expand Boundaries of West Village

BYLINE: By RACHELLE GARBARINE 

 BODY:
An 11-story, 9-unit condominium loft building is rising on what was once a weed-choked lot at 495 West Street at the western edge of Greenwich Village. Not far away, at 359 West 11th Street, a 10-story, 25-unit condominium will soon take shape where an old garage once stood.
The projects are the latest of six condominium structures, including the renovation of a 19th-century industrial building, that were recently completed or started, ending a 10-year dry spell of construction in the West Village. All told, they will produce 209 lofts and apartments, and at least 3 more projects, with 10 to 25 units each, are planned. 
Most of the activity began 18 months ago in an area west of Washington Street to West Street, running from Horatio Street south to Leroy Street, just a few blocks south of the Gansevoort meatpacking district, considered the last bastion for development in the West Village.
Arthur Strickler, district manager for Community Board 2, which guides growth in the area, said improvements to the West Side Highway and the planned Hudson River Park had helped attract developers to the neighborhood's western fringe. Because the area is outside the Greenwich Village Historic District, east of Washington Street, it does not face restrictions on development, like height limits, that accompany historic-district designation.
"The boundaries of the West Village," said Pamela Liebman, managing partner at the Corcoran Group, a Manhattan brokerage, "are expanding due to the demand for housing, especially condominiums, which are limited, and buyers' willingness to go beyond a neighborhood's traditional borders to find it."
The push to condominiums is also being stoked by a strong economy and favorable mortgage rates, as well as the lack of rentals and the high rents for those units available, which are encouraging people to buy, said Helene Luchnick, senior vice president at Douglas Elliman, another Manhattan brokerage.
Though the projects are smaller than their earlier counterparts -- mainly because of the size of development sites -- they offer apartments that are larger or seem bigger because they have high ceilings and many windows, she said.
The condominium apartments that are now or are soon to be under construction in the area range from 637 to 2,536 square feet. The lofts have 1,550 to 5,000 square feet.
The demand is being generated by professional couples and families from the Upper East and Upper West Sides, who are migrating downtown for more space, said Roberta Benzilio, executive vice president at the William B. May Company brokerage and manager of its West Village office. It is also coming from local residents seeking to trade up or switch from renting to owning, she said.
The demand is pushing up prices. The May brokerage puts the average sale price of condominiums in the West Village at $500 a square foot, up from $460 a foot last year, with luxury units selling at up to $700 a square foot.
Developers of projects that are nearing completion of their sales campaigns said they had increased prices three to four times in response to the market. For instance, since sales began last May at a building at 99 Jane Street, which with 84 apartments is the largest of the new projects, prices were increased 4 times, for an overall average rise of 10 percent, according to the developer, the Rockrose Development Corporation.
Prices for the units, with 1,193 to 2,321 square feet, are $500,000 to $1.5 million, or an average of $575 a square foot. Two apartments remain unsold, said Kevin P. Singleton, a vice president at Rockrose.
Brokers said that the demand for condominiums would continue and that the market would absorb the units. But Mr. Strickler of Community Board 2, noting that most of the projects were not in the landmark district, said concerns persisted among some local residents that the western-edge neighborhood would become crowded with tall buildings. His board and local business and civic groups are continuing to push for the creation of a waterfront historic district to help preserve the neighborhood's character.
Meanwhile, construction continues. The building at 495 West Street, across the West Side Highway from the river, will contain full-floor lofts, each with 3,300 square feet, on its first seven stories, which will be clad with blond and chocolate brick.
The top four floors, which are set back and faced with blond brick, will house two duplex penthouses, each with 5,000 square feet and a private terrace or rooftop deck.
The project, to be completed in June, is being developed by Tamarkin Architecture and Development of Manhattan.
All of the lofts will have 10 1/2-foot-high ceilings and will be offered as unfinished space, allowing buyers to design their own units.
The lofts will be priced at $950,000 to $3.8 million, with common charges, including taxes, of $1,000 to $4,600 a month. Sales are expected to start in 30 to 60 days.
The building at 359 West 11th will be constructed over the next 11 months by the Rockland Companies of Manhattan. The 25 one- to four-bedroom apartments, including two duplex penthouses, will have 673 to 2,536 square feet and some will be able to be combined. Prices are expected to range from $275,000 to $1.9 million.

HEADLINE: Help for the Uninsured May Rest in Tax Code

BYLINE: By PETER T. KILBORN 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 11

 BODY:
Not since the demise of the Clinton Administration plan to overhaul the nation's health care system have Americans without health insurance, now more than 43 million people, received so much attention.
With the post-impeachment Congress determined to demonstrate interest in domestic policy, and with lobbyists of all stripes trying to influence the health insurance debate, the long-overlooked uninsured are suddenly "hot." 
 The road to any enactment of legislation providing them coverage will be complicated, with many Republicans focused on marketplace solutions, and some Democrats on marketplace shortcomings. But across much of the political spectrum, a bit of consensus on an approach is developing.
Rather than start a whole new Government insurance program or expand the old ones -- Medicaid and the already overburdened Medicare -- Republican leaders, a number of Democrats and an array of powerful interest groups are looking for solutions in the tax system. Proposals receiving serious consideration on Capitol Hill would give millions of working families, which account for the bulk of the uninsured, tax breaks to buy health insurance.
Already this year, Republicans and Democrats alike have introduced at least six bills that would let the nation's three million self-employed workers immediately deduct the full cost of insurance. The bills would speed a phase-in that allows the self-employed to deduct 45 percent of premiums this year, a break that under current tax law escalates very gradually and does not reach 100 percent deduction until 2007.
In addition to those measures, others now pending would offer tax credits (distinct from a deduction in that they are subtracted from the tax bill itself, rather than just from the income on which the tax is based). For instance, Representative Dick Armey of Texas, the House majority leader, plans to introduce legislation this spring to give uninsured workers and their families an annual tax credit tentatively set at $800 per adult and $400 per child, to a maximum of $2,400, to buy insurance.
Under the Armey bill, the credits would even be "refundable" to the poorest workers, who earn too little to pay much or, often, any income tax. With a refundable credit, an individual worker whose tax would ordinarily be $500, for instance, would keep that amount and be sent $300 more by the Government, giving him $800 to pay for all or a part of his annual premium.
Even some Democrats who agree with Mr. Armey on little else are prepared to go along with credits, hopeful that by extending coverage to more people, they can move the nation a step closer to the goal of universal coverage that eluded President Clinton in 1994.
But others, like Representative Pete Stark of California, the ranking Democrat on the House Ways and Means Subcommittee on Health, are skeptical that the proposals now under consideration offer meaningful help. Mr. Armey's maximum credit of $2,400, for instance, would pay less than half the annual premium that insurers require of many families.
Whatever the merits of the proposals, there is little disagreement that the issue's time has come. "It's a very hot topic right now," said Eugene Steurele, a tax policy expert at the Urban Institute.
Some of the impetus to deal now with the problem stems from projections of more than a decade of Federal budget surpluses ahead. "Why not return some of it in a way that also helps alleviate the crisis of the uninsured?" Mr. Armey wrote to colleagues in January.
Weighing in with tax-break ideas of their own are a score of prominent lobbying groups and policy research organizations, running the gamut from the Heritage Foundation, the Cato Institute and the National Center for Policy Analysis on the right to the Progressive Policy Institute, a group of moderate Democrats. Similarly the American Medical Association (an emphatic proponent of strictly regulating health maintenance organizations) and the United States Chamber of Commerce (an emphatic opponent) joined last month to promote the idea of tax credits.
The concepts under discussion would be in keeping with a longtime Federal practice of using the tax code as an instrument of social policy. A provision in President Clinton's current budget proposal, for instance, offers $1,000 tax credits to help pay for long-term care.
But skeptics like Congressman Stark insist that the uninsured poor would find the health care credits too small to be of much appeal -- to say nothing of deductions, which favor people in high tax brackets and are all but meaningless to those who earn so little that they pay virtually no income tax.
"We're open to it," Chris Jennings, a White House health policy official, said of the tax credit notion, but "we have not found the model" that could be simply and fairly administered and be generous enough to reach large numbers of people.
Congressional critics of the Armey approach are perhaps most heatedly opposed to a Republican idea that would ultimately offer tax credits to all, so that they could do their own health insurance shopping. Mr. Stark says employers would use the availability of those credits as a rationale to stop providing benefits, which in many cases would be more generous than those that could be bought with the credits. "Tell me," he said, "why every employer wouldn't drop health insurance in a New York minute."
Indeed, Democrats who have little argument with "targeted" credits, aimed specifically at the poor, see broader credits that might undercut the employer-based insurance system as a danger that would leave workers vulnerable to the vagaries of the marketplace free-for-all.
More generally, Henry J. Aaron, senior fellow and budget economist at the Brookings Institution, finds little promise in using the tax system to steer consumers into the marketplace for coverage.
"It's part of the Zeitgeist," Mr. Aaron said of the emerging consensus. "We are into market solutions -- vouchers in education, privatizing Social Security. Not to be talking about tax credits for health care" would seem like "a gross omission."
"But I don't think it's got any future," he said, adding that unless Congress created a big regulatory apparatus like the one envisioned in the long-dead Clinton plan, insurers and H.M.O.'s would pick and choose among consumers, setting premiums low to attract the young and healthy and prohibitively high for older and sicker workers.
Ranit Schmelzer, a spokeswoman for the Senate Democratic leader, Tom Daschle of South Dakota, agreed that "a lot of things have to be fixed in the individual market" before a tax-break approach could be enacted. She said she did not see tax credits or vouchers "as something that has a lot of traction this year."
Still, the bills keep coming, and their details vary widely. Representative Jim McDermott of Washington, a doctor who is a Democratic member of the Federal commission on the future of Medicare, would give tax credits to cover 30 percent of the insurance premiums of individuals with incomes up to $25,000 and families with incomes up to $40,000.
Senator Barbara Boxer, Democrat of California, has drafted a bill that would allow a deduction of up to $2,000 to each working taxpayer who buys health insurance privately.
At the extreme is the legislation planned by Representative Bill Thomas of California, chairman of the House Ways and Means Subcommittee on Health. He says he will offer a bill this year to jettison the entire employer-based insurance system, which covers close to two-thirds of all workers. Mr Thomas's goal is shared by Mr. Armey, who acknowledges that as a political matter, it is unattainable any time soon.
Under the current system, Mr. Thomas complains, Congress gives tax breaks to businesses that provide insurance benefits to their workers, and the Government allows the businesses to pass the breaks on to their employees. (That is, the employees are not taxed on the benefits.)
In some cases, companies pay a worker's entire premium; more often they pay 60 to 80 percent. But more than 18 percent of all workers, 24.6 million of them, went without health insurance in 1997, according to the nonpartisan Employee Benefit Research Institute. And about half of those 24.6 million earned less than $30,000, leaving few with enough to buy insurance on their own.
"How can we provide 100 percent coverage for some workers," Mr. Thomas said, "when others have zero? That's crazy."
So he would take away the business tax break and build a new system based on tax breaks to individuals, who would buy their own insurance. "I want to change the whole system," he said. "You have to go back to square one and rethink it."

HEADLINE: Nike Critic Praises Gains in Air Quality at Vietnam Factory

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE 

 BODY:
A prominent critic who badly hurt Nike's image when he exposed unsafe conditions at one of its factories in Vietnam in 1997 issued a report yesterday that gave the footwear giant high marks for improving air quality at the plant, although he said some significant problems remained.
After disclosing 18 months ago that the air in parts of the plant had levels of cancer-causing substances that exceeded local standards by 177 times, the critic, Dara O'Rourke, applauded the factory for improving ventilation, reducing the use of hazardous chemicals and training managers on safety issues. 
 Mr. O'Rourke, an environmental researcher at the University of California at Berkeley, praised Nike for a turnaround, noting that it was substituting less harmful chemicals for dangerous ones and had taken the unusual step of allowing a critic like him to inspect the factory, which is outside Ho Chi Minh City. Nike, the world's largest athletic shoe company, let Mr. O'Rourke visit the factory in December while he was in Vietnam working as a consultant for the United Nations Industrial Development Organization.
"There have been important improvements, but I don't want to say Nike has solved all its problems," Mr. O'Rourke said in an interview.
Mr. O'Rourke criticized the factory, which is owned and operated by a Korean contractor, for making insufficient use of protective equipment like masks and gloves and for having excessive heat and noise in parts of the plant, which has 9,200 workers.
Dusty Kidd, Nike's director of labor relations, said in an interview that the Tae Kwang Vina factory was an average factory, not a model one, and that the improvements there were similar to those at Nike factories throughout Asia. To prove that conditions have improved at other Nike factories, Mr. Kidd said Nike would allow Mr. O'Rourke to visit any of its 37 footwear factories in Asia.
Global Exchange, a human rights group that has been Nike's harshest and most persistent critic, issued a statement yesterday praising the company for improving conditions and for letting an outside monitor inspect the factory.
Medea Benjamin, the group's co-director, said, "This is certainly an astounding transformation for a company that once treated independent monitoring as a public relations exercise, limiting factory access to people they thought would write favorable reports."
In November 1997, Mr. O'Rourke made public a damning inspection report about the Vietnam factory, leaked to him by a disgruntled employee, that the accounting firm Ernst & Young had prepared for Nike's internal use. That report said that 77 percent of the factory's workers reported respiratory problems in 1996 and that employees worked 65 hours a week, far more than Vietnamese law allowed. Hours have since been reduced to about 45 a week.
Much of Nike's effort to improve air quality has involved reducing the use of petroleum-based chemicals -- known as volatile organic compounds -- used in adhesives, solvents and primers. These chemicals include toluene, which causes damage to the liver, kidneys and central nervous system, and acetone, which causes respiratory problems. Nike is relying instead on water-based chemicals because they are considerably less dangerous when they evaporate, although Mr. O'Rourke called for studying the health effects of these chemicals.
Yesterday's report, which was written Mr. O'Rourke and Garrett Brown, an occupational safety expert, said the factory "has implemented important changes over the past 18 months which appear to have significantly reduced worker exposures to toxic solvents, adhesives and other chemicals."
Mr. Kidd said Nike had cut its use of volatile organic compounds to 70 grams for every pair of shoes from 340 grams three years ago. He said that converting to water-based chemicals had cost millions of dollars but but that because 30 percent less of these chemicals are needed than the petroleum-based ones, Nike's operating costs had been cut by more than $10 million a year.
Mr. O'Rourke's report noted that 18 percent of workers at the Vietnam factory reported nose and throat illnesses last year, down from 86 percent in 1997 and 77 percent in 1996. But his report said it was puzzling that the number of workers going to the factory's clinic for what they said were respiratory problems was about the same last year as in 1997. Mr. O'Rourke called on Nike to more closely monitor how many workers have respiratory problems.
His report noted that several rooms with heavy equipment had dangerously high noise levels and that the temperature in the plant often exceeded 98 degrees. He complained that many workers did not use ear plugs and that the cotton masks and gloves many workers used were inadequate to protect them from the chemicals with which they work.

Oil Ministers Study Export Cuts to Aid Prices

BYLINE: By AGIS SALPUKAS 

 BODY:
Oil ministers from five major oil producing nations met in the Netherlands yesterday in an effort to cut crude oil exports of up to two million barrels a day aimed at further bolstering the recent modest recovery in crude oil prices.
The discussions were taking place outside The Hague and included oil ministers from Saudi Arabia, Iran, Venezuela and Algeria, which are members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, as well as with Mexico. 
 The ministers broke up yesterday without issuing a statement and will meet again today.
Mexico joined Saudi Arabia and Venezuela last spring in an alliance to push through production cuts of 2.6 million barrels a day in the face of a 40 percent wholesale price decline last year. The glut of crude oil helped keep down gasoline prices, which normally rise in the spring as demand increases. Without the efforts of the producers, some analysts said, crude oil prices would have plunged even further.
Ali bin Ibrahim al-Naimi, the oil minister of Saudi Arabia, has said that the ministers would seek to hammer out a new accord between OPEC and non-OPEC producers that would result in substantial new cuts.
Prices of crude oil, which have rebounded by about $3.30 a barrel since mid-February, fell yesterday after surging on Wednesday.
Brent crude oil for April delivery fell by 9 cents, closing at $12.37 a barrel on the International Petroleum Exchange.
The price of crude oil for April delivery fell 38 cents, or 2.6 percent, to close at $14.31 on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
World demand has been rising slightly and production in such countries in the United States has dropped as wells have been shut because of low prices. The high level of inventories has also begun to drop.
But Ann-Louise Hittle, the director of international petroleum at Cambridge Energy Associates, an energy consulting group in Cambridge, Mass., cautioned that if further cuts were not made, inventories would again begin to build in the second quarter.
"There's going to be some downward pressure on prices," she added.
One problem had been that OPEC and the countries cooperating with it had failed to reach last year's goal of cutting 2.6 million barrels a day. In February they had achieved only about 79 percent of the pledged cut, according to a survey made by Bloomberg.
The current effort to cut production further is being led by Saudi Arabia, which is the world's largest oil exporter. Like many other major oil producers, its economy has been hit hard by the falling prices.

Banks Pledgeto Help Brazil

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
Banks including Chase Manhattan, Citigroup Inc. and J. P. Morgan & Company pledged yesterday to stop cutting credit lines to Brazil, offering hope the country can stem an outflow of money that has caused its currency to plunge 37 percent since January.
Brazil has lost $19 billion in short-term finance since August, first because of a default by Russia and later because of its devaluation of its currency, the real. That has left the Government and companies in Brazil starved for cash as they struggle to repay debt and climb out of recession. 
 The pledge was made during a meeting in New York with Arminio Fraga, the recently appointed central bank chief. The banks agreed to maintain their interbank loans and trade lines at Feb. 28 levels through Aug. 31.
"I think as this program is successfully implemented the banks will voluntarily increase their lines" of credit, said William Rhodes, the vice chairman of Citibank. He was asked by the Brazilian Government to coordinate efforts to get other creditor banks to also keep their credit lines to February levels.
Mr. Fraga said the economic plan he presented to bankers was the same that Brazil agreed to with the International Monetary Fund last week.

HEADLINE: Will East Meet West in Europe? Cost of Union Is a Big Barrier

BYLINE: By CRAIG R. WHITNEY 

DATELINE: PARIS, March 11

 BODY:
Now that Poland, the Czech Republic and Hungary are joining the NATO alliance, perhaps the European Union might be less afraid about letting them in too, President Vaclav Havel of the Czech Republic observed during a recent swing through Western Europe.
"The curtain that came down 50 years ago was ripped away 10 years ago, but in certain respects, it still exists as a kind of psychological barrier," he said recently. "Admission into NATO is a significant step, because we see that the West is not afraid of us." 
 Ten years after the collapse of the Iron Curtain, the most important barrier still separating the east of Europe from the more fortunate west is money.
While the Atlantic alliance, led by the United States, is willing to see the first three formerly Communist countries as full partners, the European Union is still years away from admitting any of them.
Among the most important reasons are the costs.
According to the accession agreements they have worked out with the alliance, Poland, the Czech Republic and Hungary together will be assessed only about $65 million a year for NATO programs, according to allied officials in Brussels.
But offsetting this, the alliance plans to put $150 million a year for the next 10 years into helping the three countries improve military airfields, communications networks and air defenses they had built as members of the Warsaw Pact.
Poland plans to raise its military budget to $3.3 billion this year, half a billion more than in 1997, while the Czech Republic and Hungary plan to spend $1.2 billion and $745 million in 1999, respectively.
All three new members might well have been tempted to spend more on their militaries if they were not entering the collective security of NATO, supporters of expansion say. Skeptics say that NATO's cost estimates are much too low.
But joining NATO looks almost easy compared with the costs and the complexities of joining the European Union.
Letting poorer countries from Eastern Europe join the European Union will cost both new and old members of that organization money, though hardly as much as the United States spent after World War II in the Marshall Plan.
"The West spent a lot on armament," Gyorgy Konrad, a Hungarian writer, lamented at a recent gathering of central European and western policy makers and intellectuals in Berlin. "It appears not to want to spend a lot on solidarity."
Instead, starting with Germany, the cry from the rich but unemployment-plagued European countries is to spend less, not more, on items like farm programs, which cost Europe nearly $44 billion last year, 45 percent of the total European Union budget.
After wrangling all winter between Germany and France, European agriculture ministers finally agreed today, after negotiating all night, to cut price supports for grain, beef and dairy products by 15 to 20 percent over the next few years. But experts believe more changes are necessary before countries like Poland, with tens of thousands of small farmers, join the system.
The agricultural policy was set up at the end of the 1950's, when German leaders still felt guilty about what the Nazis had done to France. The goal was to keep French farmers, then far more numerous than they are now, prosperous while German industry got free access to French and other European markets.
But Chancellor Gerhard Schroder was not even alive during World War II, and questions why Germany pays more in farm support programs than it receives. Now, like many of his generation, he does not see why Germany should be asked to foot more than its share of the European bill.
Spain, Portugal, and Italy are fighting proposed cuts in European regional infrastructure investment programs. And almost all countries are fighting changes in cumbersome decision-making procedures that, with 15 member states, often make European Union meetings last all night.
Without change, European leaders keep saying, new members could bring only total gridlock or bankruptcy. But change will surely take a few more all-night meetings like a special European summit conference planned later this month in Berlin, the third such meeting since last fall.
Hans van den Broek, the European commissioner for foreign affairs, said that the European Union was spending $1.6 billion a year helping prospective new members get ready. "The candidates have to be able to adopt and, more importantly, implement some 80,000 pages of laws," he said.
All this will take time, he says, time the formerly Communist countries also need to make sure their economies are not overwhelmed and crushed by more powerful Western ones when they join the European Union and trade barriers come down.
At this rate, even Mr. Havel's target of 2002 for membership for the Czech Republic looks optimistic.
"European leaders spent more time at their summit in Vienna in December talking about ways to postpone abolishing duty-free shops next year than they did about the prospect of admitting countries from Eastern Europe," said the French philosopher Andre Glucksmann. "I think we have wasted 10 years."

HEADLINE: Investment Banks Must Soothe Asian Sensibilities

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER 

DATELINE: HONG KONG, March 11

 BODY:
Investment banks have always struggled to reconcile their roles as tough-minded analysts and smooth-talking salespeople. Nowhere is this truer than in Asia, where the lines between government and business can be blurry and the opportunities to offend both are legion.
The regional division of Goldman, Sachs & Company has become the latest to stumble in this minefield. The investment firm recently felt obliged to apologize to Thailand after one of its reports drove down the shares of the nation's largest bank and angered the Finance Minister. 
 "All of us at Goldman Sachs deeply regret the controversial media attention that our 'Market Flash' dated February 8th subsequently generated in the Thai press," said the president of Goldman Sachs Asia, Philip Murphy, in a letter last month to the Finance Minister, Tarrin Nimmanahaeminda.
In that report to clients, Goldman's chief Asian banking analyst, Roy Ramos, said that Mr. Tarrin viewed Bangkok Bank as the "biggest risk factor in Thailand's banking system." After Mr. Tarrin denied saying that, Mr. Ramos conceded that the characterization was his own.
Like most of its competitors, Goldman has hastened to make amends, rather than risk losing business from either the Government or private companies, which are loath to use a bank that is in disfavor.
Eugene K. Galbraith, former head of research at ABN Amro in Hong Kong, remarked, "Since the nexus of government and business is so much closer in Asia than in Europe or the U.S., the consequences of offending the Government are much greater."
While officials can be thin-skinned in any Asian country, bankers feel this most acutely in dealings with China. Almost every major firm here can tell of a chill wind from Beijing after they published reports critical of the economy or of politically connected companies.
In one of the most prominent examples, Morgan Stanley ran afoul of Beijing when the firm's chief strategist, Barton M. Biggs, advised clients in October 1997 to steer clear of the Hong Kong stock market. (He had unkind words for some other Asian markets, too.)
The report outraged Wang Qishan, who was then chairman of a leading Chinese bank that played a role in the sale of shares in China Telecom. Mr. Wang is now the executive vice governor of Guangdong province.
Last May, Shandong International Power Development, a Government-controlled company, dismissed Morgan Stanley as its investment banker. A spokesman for the investment bank said he doubted that there was a direct link between the Biggs report and the bank's action, though he confirmed China's hard feelings.
More recently, the head of China research at HSBC Holdings resigned after clashing with his superiors over his forecast for economic growth in China in 1999. The researcher, Joe Zhang, had projected that China's gross domestic product would grow only 3 percent this year. Recent Chinese growth has approached 10 percent in some years, and this year's official projection is for 7 percent growth.
The subdued forecast angered officials in Beijing, who expressed their objections to HSBC's group chairman, John Bond, according to two executives at the banking group. When Mr. Zhang refused to endorse a more optimistic outlook, these people said, he was forced out. At the time, HSBC's investment banking unit was helping to underwrite a $1 billion bond issue by the Chinese Government.
HSBC has declined to discuss Mr. Zhang's departure. But in an interview late last month, the group chief executive, Keith R. Whitson, said: "We are in 79 countries around the world. By definition, that means we are a guest in 78. And we believe in behaving as guests should behave."
Such a gentlemanly approach comes more easily to commercial banks like HSBC than to investment banking firms like Goldman. As lenders of capital rather than wooers and deal financiers, they rely less on their research to market themselves. Goldman, by contrast, uses star analysts like Mr. Ramos to lure clients.
Mr. Ramos, who joined Goldman in 1984, was ranked as the No. 1 banking analyst in Asia by Asia Money magazine in 1998. A soft-spoken former executive at Mellon Bank, he enjoys easy access to finance ministers.
That access may have landed him in trouble. It was after a meeting with Mr. Tarrin on Feb. 5 that Mr. Ramos issued a downbeat report on Bangkok Bank. The remarks attributed to Mr. Tarrin scared investors, and the bank's shares plunged 8.1 percent after the report became public.
Executives at Goldman said Mr. Ramos's report had been scrutinized by lawyers, compliance officers and the head of research before it was released. But they said the reviewers would not generally question a senior analyst on the substance of talks with a Government official.
In Goldman's letter of apology, Mr. Murphy said Mr. Ramos admitted that he had, in effect, put his words in Mr. Tarrin's mouth.
Mr. Ramos was traveling in the United States and did not return a telephone call. Mr. Murphy also did not respond to requests for comment.
Peter Rose, a Goldman spokesman in Hong Kong, said, "We deeply regret the mischaracterization." But he added, "We were never asked to, nor did we, alter our conclusions on the Thai banking sector."
Another reason Goldman is so eager to resolve this dispute is that it may have inadvertently fed ammunition to Mr. Tarrin's critics. Opposition leaders have seized on the report as grist for their accusations that the Government wants to sell Thailand's troubled banks to foreigners.
Thai Parliament members are now considering whether to ask the Government to sever its relationship with Goldman. E. Gerald Corrigan, a Goldman partner and former president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, advises Mr. Tarrin. The firm also handled an $850 million stock offering for the Thai Farmers Bank.
If Goldman hopes to win more such assignments, it needs to persuade Thailand's business elite that it has not lost its friends in high places.

HEADLINE: 3 Fragments of Soviet Realm Joining NATO's Ranks Today

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER 

DATELINE: WARSAW, March 11

 BODY:
When Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic formally join NATO on Friday, it will symbolize the return of three nations, and not merely their militaries, to the center of European civilization.
The Polish Foreign Minister, Bronislaw Geremek, a soulful historian of the medieval world, compares the importance of NATO accession to nothing less than Poland's conversion to Christianity nearly 1,000 years ago. 
President Aleksander Kwasniewski of Poland said enlarging the alliance brings an end to a divided Europe. "This is the most important moment in our history," he said.
For Vaclav Havel, the Czech President, who was jailed by the Communist regime, membership means that "we will have a solid security anchoring for the first time in our history, and an anchoring in the democratic world, in the world of protection of democratic values."
By their history and geography, these new members will help to protect and even promote those values. But NATO tenure requires high military spending and difficult choices at home just as the regional economy is cooling off. The Czechs are in recession, Hungary has a yawning budget deficit, and Poland's growth is expected to drop this year to 3.5 percent of economic output.
As the reality of membership looms -- together with the prospect of NATO's bombing Yugoslavia -- popular enthusiasm for the alliance has dropped in all three countries. Recent polls say some 60 percent of Poles and Hungarians favor membership now, down from over 80 percent a year ago, and just over 50 percent of Czechs, down from some 55 percent.
But all three governments remain enthusiastic about the alliance and committed to increased military spending. They are already contributing with peacekeepers, logistics and intelligence to the West's complicated efforts in the Balkans.
At first, these three countries will add little to NATO's military capabilities. In fact, they have just managed to meet the alliance's minimum military requirements for integrated air defense, security procedures and language training.
But few doubt that they will bring real military benefits to the alliance over the next 5 to 10 years as they make the slow shift from heavily armored forces top-heavy with officers to more mobile, flexible and smaller armies.
They are also eager to consolidate Western values at home, both to increase their own confidence and that of foreign investors. Their leaders welcome the moral standard NATO provides for their still turbulent post-Communist societies.
Six weeks before the alliance's 50th anniversary summit meeting in Washington, where the champagne and the rhetoric will overflow, members continue to argue about the organization's future.
But these three countries also bring a fresh dose of support to Washington's aims for redefining NATO's mission, officials of all three countries suggest. It was the United States, after all, that pushed their membership the hardest, a Polish official said.
"We want to be good Europeans," he said. "But more than anyone except perhaps the British, we understand how important it is to keep the Americans involved in Europe."
 
In the Service of NATO, An End to Servility
For the militaries of all three nations, NATO membership is also a chance to pacify, if not bury, some ghosts. While some officers feel they are simply exchanging the language of one empire for another, most recognize that it is a voluntary alliance that works by consensus.
Col. Petr Vlcnovsky, who commands a Czech air defense brigade, said that membership in the Warsaw Pact meant a depressing servility to Moscow's orders. A military career, he said, commanded little social respect. "We had no opportunity to make decisions as a sovereign state," he said. "Now we can decide for ourselves, as a full partner in NATO committees."
In Poland, the military, like the Roman Catholic Church, is at the center of its national identity, and the Hungarians, too, have an important military tradition. While there is some truth to "The Good Soldier Schweik" notion of the Czech military man -- survival despite apparent bungling in 300 years of occupation -- Czech soldiers have served with distinction alongside the British in Bosnia and the Americans in the Persian Gulf.
Such successes -- like Poland's peacekeeping efforts around the world and Hungary's engineering battalion, which has rebuilt 84 bridges in four years in Bosnia -- will go a long way to raise the stature of the military within society, says Tamas Wachsler, the young State Secretary of the Hungarian Defense Ministry.
"The key to rebuilding the overall character and prestige of the military is to give it teeth," he said. "NATO helps, not just by providing world standards but by opening up international careers to officers."
By insisting on civilian control over the military, the alliance makes it easier to reform these armies and subordinate them to popular will, a senior Polish official said.
"Poland has never before had a modern democracy, and the military, like the church, has never been a democratic institution in Poland," he said. "The real test for NATO -- and for Poland -- is how to deal with undemocratic institutions and make them compatible with democracy."
That process has started. Of Poland's 130 generals, fewer than 10 had the rank before 1989. "But it will also take time," the senior official said.
 
Military Demand Met, But Much Is Still to Do
Deep in a bunker under the Czech town of Stara Boleslav, there is a sophisticated Warsaw Pact air defense command headquarters that has been transformed with American aid into an alliance installation that keeps watch over Czech airspace.
There are similar centers in Poland and Hungary, and the American ambassadors to all three countries talk enthusiastically about their "Dr. Strangelove" quality, with their huge overhead screens and sophisticated computers. The installations will also help make commercial air travel safer for civilians.
All three centers opened only last month, but they were the most crucial military requirement for joining NATO. The new members could hardly be defended without an integrated air defense system, coupled with 24-hour patrols and jet fighters with a rapid reaction capability.
"That said," noted a senior military attache for a Western country, "all the air crews need better tactics, training and doctrine." Officials in all three countries expressed concern that while military spending was increasing, the money going to operations and training, especially for combat pilots, was insufficient or dropping. Except for the immediate front-line pilots, training hours are well below NATO standards.
Hungary, for instance, gives 27 pilots it must have for air defense NATO's standard of 100 hours of training, while other pilots currently get only one hour; last November, some 40 Polish pilots quit over insufficient training.
While all three countries have met the minimum military requirements, the training issue is a good example of the significant work that remains to be done to make membership less hollow. But this was the alliance's choice, argues a senior Hungarian official.
"NATO rightly decided to invite key countries to join, provide them minimum requirements to reach in a short term, and work with them to bring them up to speed," he said. "The chances of a significant NATO military operation are very small so it's O.K. to have some countries below NATO standards now, under the assumption they will reach them in five years."
Other minimum requirements the three countries worked to meet include sometimes humdrum compatibility issues like communications equipment, adapter nozzles for fuel lines and security procedures, so Western intelligence can be shared.
Outside Poland's sprawling old Defense Ministry headquarters, for instance, there are new gates and electronically controlled turnstiles, while new locks, safes and procedures have been installed in all three countries for handling NATO secrets.
Even here, the past intercedes, but in an ironic way. The Czechs were slow to vet enough officers to take up positions in the alliance's headquarters in Brussels or to handle NATO papers. The reason was a recent Czech security law requiring psychological exams and other queries that go beyond the alliance's standards.
 
The Swords of the British Needed Special Approval
The Czechs were so scarred by the misuse of security and the extent of collaboration with the secret police under the Communist regime that they set very high standards. "In the long run, that will benefit us," said Petr Necas, chairman of Parliament's Defense and Security Committee, reflecting lingering concerns within NATO about intelligence-sharing with former Communist militaries.
In Hungary, similarly, two-thirds of those elected to Parliament must vote to allow Hungarian troops to operate outside the country. Even for Friday's celebration for joining the alliance, Parliament had to vote to allow British Grenadiers to bring their ceremonial swords into the country.
These laws make it more complicated, but hardly impossible, to take part in NATO exercises, said Mr. Wachsler, the Defense Ministry State Secretary.
Another important requirement is training in English, the language commonly used by NATO, which has gone slowly in all three countries.
Colonel Vlcnovsky, the Czech commander, was interviewed in his advanced English class in an exquisite 14th-century castle in Komorni Hradek, near Brno. The castle was seized from a Nazi collaborator in 1945, and later served as a school for political commissars.
The classrooms are now used for some 90 students taking basic and advanced English. In one classroom, the words "body odor" were on the blackboard, an indication, the teacher said, that preparation for service abroad covered "many aspects of life."
For Colonel Vlcnovsky and his classmates, better English is a career-builder. "The chances of us fighting a war on our own territory now are very small compared to the possibility of serving abroad, in Bosnia or elsewhere," he said. "English is simply necessary for our future careers."
 
A Change in Mentality Is High on the Agenda
Despite the problems of transition, all three countries have worked with the alliance to insure that they are providing immediate resources and capabilities to the alliance.
The Hungarians have long provided Western access to the big Warsaw Pact air base at Taszar where several hundred American and other foreign troops handled Western deployments into Bosnia. They also permit NATO troops to be stationed there and to fly over Hungarian territory for surveillance of Serbia, Kosovo and the Albanian border. Hungary will also provide two brigades for NATO's rapid reaction force and a medical team with a hospital.
The Czechs specialize in defense against chemical and biological weapons and are providing a chemical defense company of about 140 people for immediate NATO service.
For their part, the Poles are providing an excellent antiterrorist unit, some of whose members already protect William Walker, the American diplomat who runs the international observers in Kosovo. They are providing an air assault brigade of paratroopers and some armored units, as well as 10,000 troops as part of a German-Danish-Polish mechanized corps.
But the biggest tasks are yet to come. All three countries need to modernize a Warsaw Pact structure that contained too many officers without enough initiative. They need to train a corps of noncommissioned officers, reduce the number of colonels by half and teach soldiers to make decisions.
Everyone agrees that changing mentality will be as difficult as finding the economic resources over the next 5 and 10 years to keep modernization on track. "The real question is staying power over time," a senior NATO official said.
Maj. Gen. Jaroslav Hudec, who directs Czech military modernization, said: "We've done our minimum requirements. Some will complain on March 12, but hourly it will be hard work for us, not just before joining NATO but afterward. We must all -- military officers and politicians -- continue to persuade everyone what must be done. We must move from a Warsaw Pact force to another kind, and it must be done for ourselves, for our nation, not just because of NATO."

HEADLINE: Clinton and Latin Leaders Turn to Immigration

BYLINE: By JOHN M. BRODER 

DATELINE: ANTIGUA, Guatemala, March 11

 BODY:
President Clinton and a group of Central American leaders declared today that they would work among themselves and with the United States to reach "humane and permanent solutions" to the problems of illegal immigration.
The declaration was issued at a one-day meeting here that focused on reconstruction after a devastating autumn hurricane, development, trade and immigration. 
 The leaders also promised to accelerate efforts to assist one another in the economic and political transformation of the region after decades of strife and catastrophic natural disasters.
The meeting, at the end of a four-day visit by Mr. Clinton to the subcontinent, brought together Presidents Arnoldo Aleman of Nicaragua, Alvaro Arzu of Guatemala, Armando Calderon Sol of El Salvador, Leonel Fernandez Reyna of the Dominican Republic, Carlos Roberto Flores of Honduras and Miguel Angel Rodriguez Echeverria of Costa Rica, as well as Prime Minister Said Wilbert Musa of Belize.
They met at the Casa Santo Domingo, a hotel built around the ruins of a church and monastery built by Dominicans in the 16th century and largely destroyed by earthquakes in 1717 and 1773. This picturesque colonial town, in a valley formed by three volcanoes, was the capital of all of Central America until the 18th century.
At the opening of the session, Mr. Clinton noted that he was the first American President to visit Guatemala since Lyndon B. Johnson stopped briefly at the Guatemala City airport in the 60's. "This visit is long overdue," Mr. Clinton said. "More importantly, this moment in history is long overdue."
The Administration announced four small initiatives to foster growth and reconciliation. The Administration will provide $25 million to bolster the Guatemalan peace accord of 1996, including money for schools, small-business development, courts and local governments.
The Administration also plans to grant $25 million for environmental protection throughout the region, $11 million for disaster response and $8.2 million to eliminate child labor.
The meeting was marred by Mr. Clinton's inability to deliver a much larger package of hurricane relief, totaling $956 million, that has been held up by a dispute with Congress.
Central American leaders and a few protesters in El Salvador and Guatemala complained that United States immigration policy discriminated against some political refugees from the region.
Mr. Calderon Sol told Mr. Clinton on Wednesday that he did not feel that United States policy was justified, because refugees from El Salvador and Guatemala did not have the same rights to settle in the United States as those from Cuba and Nicaragua.
The United States is preparing to deport 1,000 Salvadorans who fled the devastation of Hurricane Mitch, while Washington seeks a way to let El Salvadoran political refugees remain in the United States.

Hurricane Aid Gains in House
 WASHINGTON, March 11 (AP) -- Ignoring a White House threat of a veto, the House Appropriations Committee approved today a $1.3 billion measure that would offer hurricane relief for Central America. The bill passed on a voice vote after Republicans had included cuts in foreign aid and other programs.

HEADLINE: Lawmakers Want I.R.S. Help on Cruise Ships and Tax Laws

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS FRANTZ 

 BODY:
Saying the United States could be losing billions of dollars each year, two Democratic Congressmen asked the Internal Revenue Service yesterday to estimate how much foreign-owned cruise companies are saving because of tax code provisions that exempt them from income tax and other taxes.
The Congressmen, Peter A. DeFazio of Oregon and Gene Taylor of Mississippi, said in a letter to the I.R.S. Commissioner, Charles O. Rossotti, that they wanted the assessment because Congress might take up legislation later this year to expand access to United States ports by foreign-owned passenger ships. 
 Preliminary estimates from the Clinton Administration are that the tax provisions allow the industry to avoid billions of dollars a year in Federal taxes, Mr. DeFazio said.
"It appears that a large, growing and very profitable U.S.-based industry is escaping all of its Federal tax burden," Mr. DeFazio said in a telephone interview. "This is a basic issue of fairness."
Representatives of the cruise industry, which has annual revenues of about $10 billion, say that the unique tax exemption is part of international transportation law and that the industry pays millions of dollars a year in port fees and other charges. A new study for the industry found that it bought $6.6 billion worth of American goods and generated 176,433 jobs in 1997.
"We are very proud of the contribution which the cruise industry makes to the U.S. economy," said Cynthia A. Colenda, president of the International Council of Cruise Lines, the industry trade group in Washington.
Though the 17 major cruise lines are based in the United States and rely on American passengers, they are exempt from United States income tax and some other taxes because the companies are registered in foreign countries and their ships fly foreign flags. The countries in which those companies are registered do not have income tax.
An article last month in The New York Times described the tax benefits and said the Carnival Corporation, the world's largest cruise company, earned $2 billion in the last three years yet paid less than 1 percent in income taxes. The taxes were on revenue from hotels and tours in the United States. Carnival is based in Miami but registered in Panama.
Under longstanding tax law, to qualify for the income tax exemption, foreign cruise lines operating from an American port must visit a foreign destination before returning to the United States. But last year Congress debated permitting foreign ships to travel between United States ports without a foreign stop.
Some American port and tourism officials pushed for the change to increase tourism. The domestic cruise industry opposed it, arguing that American ships would have difficulty competing with foreign vessels that pay no taxes.
Mr. DeFazio, the ranking Democrat on the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee's Coast Guard and Maritime Transportation subcommittee, said he expected the issue of expanding access to American ports to arise again.
Prospects for taxing foreign cruise companies appear slim despite some support. In January, Senator Trent Lott of Mississippi, the majority leader, called on the Administration to work with Congress to re-examine tax policies that might stifle the domestic cruise business.
Mr. DeFazio acknowledged that he faced a tough battle against the foreign cruise companies, which lobby effectively. "I've been told I'm walking into a buzz saw," he said.

After losing a power struggle over economic policy that had sent tremors across Europe for months, Germany's left-wing Finance Minister abruptly resigned today, and also quit as chairman of the ruling party.
The resignation by Oskar Lafontaine marked a stunning turn for Germany's new Chancellor, Gerhard Schroder, who defeated Helmut Kohl in elections last September but whose Government has seemed confused and adrift ever since. 
 The resignation has implications well beyond Germany. As one of Europe's most combative and ideological leaders, Mr. Lafontaine had almost single-handedly talked down the value of Europe's new single currency, the euro, with his unrelenting demands on the European Central Bank to lower interest rates.
He had also moved Germany, which accounts for more than one-quarter of Europe's economic output, toward a sharply left-wing direction that frequently clashed with Mr. Schroder's more pragmatic and pro-business instincts.
But Mr. Lafontaine has been unable to stimulate German economic growth, which has slowed to a crawl while unemployment has remained at more than 10 percent.
Financial markets in Europe reacted with thunderous approval within minutes of the resignation. The euro scored its biggest one-day jump in value since it was introduced in January. It climbed from just below $1.08 to $1.10, as investors bet that German growth could get a lift and that the European Central Bank would have more freedom to steer its own course. It is widely expected that German stocks would surge on Friday.
Mr. Lafontaine gave no reason for his departure, and Mr. Schroder appeared as surprised as everyone else tonight at the resignation. It was unclear whether the Chancellor would end up a loser or a winner after the dust clears.
On the one hand, the resignation clearly reflected the disarray in economic policy and Mr. Schroder's loss of credibility. German business leaders have expressed outrage over Mr. Lafontaine's plans to increase taxes, with some big companies even threatening to move operations out of the country. He had also raised hackles with American leaders, like Robert E. Rubin, the Treasury Secretary, by campaigning for controls over exchange rates.
At the same time, Mr. Schroder appeared to have eliminated a powerful rival. Mr. Lafontaine, a burly and garrulous politician who badly wanted to run for chancellor himself, wielded enormous power as the head of Germany's ruling Social Democratic Party. Although he could never match Mr. Schroder's charisma and flair for television, he commanded a loyalty among party traditionalists and among Germany's powerful labor unions, which were crucial to Mr. Schroder's victory.
Mr. Lafontaine deferred to Mr. Schroder last year, recognizing that he could never match Mr. Schroder's popularity with voters. But as finance minister, he quickly dominated German economic policy and muscled aside more pro-business moderates.
But tensions between the two had been rising. Last week, Mr. Schroder bypassed his finance minister by pledging to German insurance companies that he would limit their tax increase to about $5 billion a year.
He also began seeking out direct contacts with business leaders, soothing ruffled feathers in order to keep them from walking out of talks with the Government and unions to create jobs.
The hostility apparently erupted at a Cabinet meeting on Wednesday. According to a report today by the newspaper Die Welt, Mr. Schroder obliquely hinted about resigning himself if the Government did not stop antagonizing industry.
According to Die Welt, Mr. Schroder railed at "anti-business policies" that were "against the majority of the people" and said he might reach the point where he would "no longer assume responsbility for such a policy."
But people who were in the chancellory today said Mr. Schroder and his top lieutenants were genuinely shocked by Mr. Lafontaine's decision, which he conveyed in an icy letter one sentence long.
In a one-minute news conference tonight in which he refused to take any questions, Mr. Schroder said he was "taken aback" by the decision, while insisting that "the stability of the work of Government is not in question."
Both supporters and opponents speculated that Mr. Schroder might seek out a new coalition, perhaps with Germany's small liberal party, the Free Democrats.
"I am shocked," said Peter Siegel, chairman of the Social Democratic Party local branch in Limbach-Oberfrohna, near Berlin. "It was evident that differences between Lafontaine and Schroder would eventually surface. But everybody in the party had hoped that one could handle them in a professional way."
Hans-Olaf Henkel, president of the German Federation of Industry and one of Mr. Schroder's toughest critics, was elated. "This will give Schroder the maneuvering room to come up with policies that are more friendly to business and growth," he said.
That view was echoed by Theo Sommer, co-publisher of the liberal weekly Die Zeit, whose other co-publisher is Helmut Schmidt, Germany's Social Democratic Chancellor in the early 1980's.
"I am happy to see this, because they had lost five months by trying to do things without knowing how to go about it," said Mr. Sommer. Much of the blame, Mr. Sommer said, went straight to Mr. Lafontaine.
"He was steering the wrong course -- far too ideological, far too left-wing and too removed from the economic realities of the country," he said.
Some experts said Mr. Lafontaine brought Mr. Schroder invaluable political skills that he may soon miss badly. "It was Lafontaine who held the party together," said Oskar Niedermeyer, a political scientist at the Free University of Berlin.

HEADLINE: Democrats Are Ready to Pick Los Angeles for Convention

BYLINE: By TODD S. PURDUM 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, March 11

 BODY:
Ending months of speculation, the Democratic National Committee and Los Angeles civic and business leaders are scheduled to announce on Monday that the party will hold its national convention here next year, for the first time since John F. Kennedy was nominated in 1960, city and party officials said today.
The officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said that a few, final financial details were being ironed out but that negotiations were expected to conclude over the weekend. A formal announcement, with the newly elected Democratic Governor, Gray Davis, and the Republican Mayor of Los Angeles, Richard J. Riordan, has been planned for 11 A.M. Monday at the downtown Staples Arena, which is under construction and will be the convention site. 
 "It's just back and forth over who's going to pay for the media center, things like that," a party official said.
For weeks, party officials have made it clear that Los Angeles is their top choice for the gathering Aug. 21-24, 2000. The city beat out two other finalists, Boston and Denver, home to the party's general chairman, Roy Roemer, and its outgoing national chairman, Steve Grossman. But party officials had worried about who would guarantee the financing for the convention because the city wanted the party to sign a contract with the private citizens' committee that was organized to sponsor the convention, instead of with the city itself, as usually happens. Officials said today that obstacle had been overcome.
An unusual triumvirate of local leaders -- Eli Broad, a billionaire businessman, David Geffen, the billionaire entertainment mogul, and William Wardlaw, a prominent lawyer and former partner of Mr. Riordan -- joined forces last year to head the host committee seeking the convention, offering about $35.5 million in financial backing. Winning the bid became an important element of Los Angeles's effort to celebrate and show off its successful rebound from years of economic, environmental and social disasters and to profit from the thousands of delegates and journalists the event will draw and the estimated $150 million in economic activity they generate.
Despite some initial worries by Vice President Al Gore that a convention might be dominated by glittery celebrities who would alienate swing voters, Administration officials said that in the end the lure of California's 54 electoral votes proved too appealing. California is vital to any Democratic candidate's electoral strategy, and especially since Mr. Davis's election last fall as the state's first Democratic Governor in 16 years, Los Angeles came to seem by far the most logical choice, officials said.
Mr. Gore was said initially to favor Philadelphia, but when the Republicans chose that city for their convention, that was no longer a possibility.
"I tell you, it's almost anticlimactic," said Rosalind Wyman, the doyenne of the city's Democratic establishment and a member of the party's site selection committee, reflecting on what has been a foregone conclusion for so long.
"I think a national convention is such a positive for a city," Ms. Wyman said. "If your city shows well at all, it has an opportunity to really show off. And televising west to east means the convention ends early here, so delegates and journalists can go out and eat and spend."

HEADLINE: Population Grows in New York City at Faster Pace

BYLINE: By JAMES DAO 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 11

 BODY:
New York City's population grew more last year than in any other year since 1986, fueled by a continuing heavy influx of immigrants and a decline in the number of people leaving for other regions, according to new estimates released today by the United States Census Bureau.
Though the rise was not huge -- between 1997 and 1998, the city's population grew by about 35,000 or one-half of 1 percent, to 7.42 million -- it represented an acceleration of the city's slow but steady growth since 1993. 
 The new estimates show that for the second consecutive year, all five of the city's boroughs grew.
Queens, the city's major magnet for immigrants, had the largest number of new residents in the state, nearly 15,000, while Richmond County -- Staten Island -- was the state's fastest-growing county, at 1.3 percent.
In recent years, the fastest growing has usually been Putnam County.
Demographers said the new figures indicated that the city's population had become somewhat more stable because of the strong economy -- with fewer people leaving for other parts of the country last year than at any other time in the 1990's -- and that its incremental growth in recent years has become a consistent trend.
"I think we're into a sustained pattern of growth," said Andrew A. Beveridge, a professor of sociology at Queens College. "For the past several decades, the history of cities has been to lose population. The degree to which that is reversing is important."
William Frey, a professor of demography at the State University of New York at Albany, said: "It's good news, but not a U-turn. The city's inching in the right direction."
Demographers say population growth is a good sign for New York City for two reasons.
First, they say, it means that safer streets and a vibrant economy are attracting new residents from other regions and abroad. Second, it indicates that fewer residents are fleeing to other places, so that more are keeping their investments in the city and helping maintain the stability of their neighborhoods.
New York State's population grew last year to 18.17 million, an increase of about 29,000, or two-tenths of 1 percent. As has been the case since 1995, the state's population would have decreased last year -- by roughly 5,500 people -- without New York City's growth.
New Jersey's population increased more robustly last year, to 8.1 million people, an increase of about 57,000, or seven-tenths of 1 percent. Eighteen of the state's 21 counties grew, with Somerset County leading the way, growing by 2.3 percent. Cumberland, Salem and Essex Counties lost population.
Connecticut's population barely inched up last year, growing by about 7,000, or two-tenths of 1 percent, to 3.27 million. All eight counties in the state showed modest growth except New London, which saw its population decline by 1.2 percent.
Despite the city's growth, the new census figures show that the New York metropolitan region, along with the entire Northeast, continued to lag well beyond the rest of the nation. While the Northeast grew by three-tenths of 1 percent, the West grew by 1.6 percent, the South by 1.3 percent and the Mountain states by 2 percent.
If current growth trends continue, New York's Congressional delegation is projected to shrink by 2 seats in the House of Representatives, to 29, after the 2000 census. Connecticut is expected to lose one seat, falling to 5, while New Jersey's delegation is projected to remain steady at 13 members.
According to the new census estimates, California led the nation in actual population growth last year, increasing to about 32.5 million , a rise of roughly 480,000 people, or 1.5 percent. Four California counties -- Los Angeles, Orange, San Diego and Riverside -- were among the top 10 counties nationwide in population growth.
Nevada was the fastest-growing state, gaining about 68,000 people, or 4.1 percent, to reach 1.74 million. But 4 of 10 fastest-growing counties with more than 10,000 people were in Georgia, led by Forsyth County near Atlanta, which grew at a pace of 13 percent last year.
For New York City, the new census figures confirm again that immigration is the demographic engine shaping the city. The Census Bureau estimated that about 102,000 new immigrants settled in the city last year, just below the 107,000 who arrived the year before.
Largely because of new immigrants from Asia and Latin America, Queens grew more last year than Manhattan, which has been the major source of the city's population growth through most of the 1990's.
Without new immigrants, the city would have lost nearly 360,000 people since 1990 -- about 23,000 last year alone -- because large numbers of people continue to leave the five boroughs for the suburbs or other states.
"The city continues to gain most of its population through immigration, and that will probably be the case for years to come," Mr. Frey said.
But the new census estimates also show that the city lost fewer people -- about 125,000 -- to its suburbs and other cities in 1998 than in any other year this decade.
Demographers said that was probably a result of the Wall Street boom, which has created new jobs and attracted younger people to the region, as well as the city's declining crime rate, which may have encouraged more elderly residents and families to remain in the five boroughs.
After the city reached its peak population of 7,894,862 in 1970, it shrank drastically as families fled to the suburbs and the elderly moved to the South and West.
By 1980, the city's population had fallen to 7,071,639. Immigration helped raise it to 7,322,564 in 1990 and to about 7.4 million in 1998, according to the new estimates.
But just as the stock market crash of 1987, along with rising crime rates, helped prompt a sharp increase in migration away from the city, another plunge in the market could reverse the city's recent growth and begin another period of contraction, demographers said.

HEADLINE: PRESIDENT DENIES IGNORING EVIDENCE OF NUCLEAR SPYING

BYLINE: By JOHN M. BRODER 

DATELINE: ANTIGUA, Guatemala, March 11

 BODY:
President Clinton vigorously denied today that the Administration had minimized evidence of nuclear spying by China and defended his policy of engagement with Beijing as the only effective means of restraining Chinese behavior.
Mr. Clinton said that he was under no illusions about China's covert efforts to acquire American nuclear weapons technology. He said that when he received persuasive evidence that highly classified data about American nuclear weapons design had been leaked from the Department of Energy's Los Alamos National Laboratory, he acted aggressively to contain the damage and prevent further incidents. 
 "We did not ignore evidence," the President said at a news conference at the conclusion of a summit meeting with Central American leaders. "Quite the contrary, we acted on it. I believe the record is clear that we did respond in an appropriate way."
Mr. Clinton's comments today were his first public statements since reports emerged over the weekend that a Taiwan-born American scientist at Los Alamos might have been responsible for providing information in the 1980's that enabled China to develop a miniaturized nuclear warhead similar to the most sophisticated weapons in the American arsenal.
Congress has opened an investigation of the case, including allegations that the Administration sought to play down the severity of the suspected espionage and delay the investigation so as not to jeopardize its policy of reconciliation with Beijing.
On Capitol Hill today, Republicans toned down their fiery criticisms of the Administration's handling of the Los Alamos case. And the House Speaker, J. Dennis Hastert, echoed Mr. Clinton's call to remain engaged with Beijing.
"The more we're involved with China, the better off we are -- for us and for China and the Pacific area," Mr. Hastert said in an interview. "It's also important that we stress our views on human rights. If we aren't engaged, we can't do that."
Mr. Clinton said that he did not become aware of the potential scope of the technology transfer until July 1997, when he was briefed on a continuing Federal Bureau of Investigation inquiry into a case of possible espionage at the Energy Department laboratories. The initial investigation produced evidence not only of a hugely damaging transfer of American nuclear technology, but of systemic leakage of military secrets from the labs.
"At that time, we moved quickly and decisively," Mr. Clinton said, "not only with the continuing F.B.I. investigation and a C.I.A. review, but also with an intense review of the counterintelligence capacities of our Energy Department labs."
But American officials have said that the Federal Government's drawn-out effort to track down the possible leak was plagued by delays, inaction and skepticism -- even though senior intelligence officials considered it one of the most damaging spy cases in recent history. For instance, a recommendation by the F.B.I. in April 1997 that background checks on visitors to Los Alamos be reinstated was ignored for 17 months by the Energy Department.
So far, no arrests have been made. A prime suspect in the case, the scientist at Los Alamos National Laboratory, was fired on Monday after three days of questioning.
The President said that beginning in early 1998 he had significantly tightened security at the weapons facilities, including requiring polygraph examinations for employees with access to critical information.
And he asserted that the intelligence committees of Congress have received 16 briefings on the matter since 1997, despite angry complaints from members that the Administration kept them largely in the dark about the alleged spying.
He also rejected calls from some Republican Presidential hopefuls that he dismiss Samuel R. Berger, the national security adviser, whom some have accused of foot-dragging in the spy case in order to protect and justify his support for a policy of close cooperation with Beijing.
"I think Mr. Berger acted appropriately and therefore I would not release him or ask for his resignation," the President said. "I just don't think there's any evidence to support that."
Senator Craig Thomas, a conservative Republican from Wyoming who heads the Foreign Relations subcommittee for Asia, dismissed as "premature" the demands for Mr. Berger's resignation. "I've never supported the idea that every time China does something we don't like we ought to submit a thing to the Senate and get after them," Mr. Thomas told reporters.
Mr. Clinton met twice with Jiang Zemin, the Chinese President, in the fall of 1997 and the summer of 1998, after Mr. Clinton learned of the espionage charges but months before they became public. The President plans to meet with the Chinese Prime Minister, Zhu Rongji, in Washington next month.
Mr. Clinton said that despite this case and other evidence of Chinese acquisition of weapons-related technology from the United States, it was in America's interest to remain engaged with the Asian giant.
He said that his policy of "strategic partnership" with China had already brought benefits, including China's signing of the Chemical Weapons Convention and the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty.
He also praised Beijing's cooperation with the United States for progress in nonproliferation programs aimed at Iran, Pakistan and North Korea. China has also played a constructive role in limiting the damage from the Asian economic crisis of the past 18 months, Mr. Clinton said.
"I would argue that our efforts to have an honest and open policy with China, so that they don't think that we have made a decision in advance to try to contain and limit them in their economic growth and their development as a nation, has paid dividends," the President said.
"I do not believe those things would have occurred if we had not had an open, candid, honest relationship with China, aware of all the facts," he added.
The President pointedly noted that the alleged transfer of weapons technology to China occurred in the mid-1980's, when China made rapid strides in its own nuclear program that were detected by United States intelligence agencies. At the time, there was no clear evidence that Chinese technological leaps were the result of theft of American weapons secrets.
But even if the current espionage case proves that Chinese spies pilfered American weapons designs, Mr. Clinton said, there remain reasons to continue to work with Beijing.
"I do not believe that the evidence justifies an isolated no-contact relationship with China," he said, "when we have gotten the benefits not only to ourselves, but to the rest of the world, of our engagement policy."

HEADLINE: Marbury, a Schoolyard Hero, Returns to Don a Nets Jersey

BYLINE: By CHRIS BROUSSARD 

 BODY:
Stephon Marbury, the Brooklyn native who is one of the most electrifying basketball players to come out of New York City in the last 25 years, is returning to the metropolitan area, joining the New Jersey Nets as part of a three-team trade.
The Nets acquired Marbury, a 22-year-old point guard, from the Minnesota Timberwolves yesterday, hours before the National Basketball Association's trading deadline. They are sending a No. 1 draft pick, either this year or next, to Minnesota, along with a backup forward, Brian Evans. The Milwaukee Bucks, the other team involved in the nine-player deal, are receiving the Nets' point guard, Sam Cassell, and a forward, Chris Gatling. 
 In Marbury, the Nets get one of the game's slickest, most reliable players at perhaps the game's most important position, point guard. He is regarded as enormously poised, strong, and fearless -- capable of brilliance every time down the court and unafraid to make mistakes, but in truth, rarely doing so. In a signature performance late last month, he became only the fifth player in league history to get at least 40 points and 10 assists in a game without making a turnover.
In the short term, the Nets are hoping Marbury will turn around a team that has floundered to a 3-15 start this season. But with their intention to sign him to a long-term contract, perhaps as early as today, the acquisition of Marbury is the latest in a series of bold recent moves by the new ownership, headed by Ray Chambers and Lewis Katz and including the entertainer Bill Cosby.
Since purchasing the club for $150 million last fall, the group has outlined plans to build a new arena in downtown Newark to revitalize the city's moribund infrastructure; committed 20 percent of their profits to programs dedicated to helping minority children, and made Jayson Williams, the club's charismatic center, the highest-paid player in franchise history, signing him to a seven-year contract worth $100.1 million.
Most significantly, the group paid $350 million last month to bring about a limited merger with the New York Yankees, coming together with the powerful baseball team to maximize their leverage for new television deals and broaden the aims of their philanthropic efforts.
"I can just see Derek Jeter and Stephon Marbury smiling down from one of those billboards on Times Square," Katz, the principal owner, said last night.
Of Marbury, he said, "We want to turn the franchise into a world-class team, both on and off the court, and bringing this young man home is another step in that direction."
Coach John Calipari of the Nets said late last night that he was "stunned" by the move by Katz, who had never negotiated an N.B.A. player deal.
Calipari said he first learned of Katz's plan about two weeks ago. Calipari recounted it last night: "He said, 'If I could get something like this done what would you think?' And I said, 'We'd all do back flips and cartwheels.' I thought it would be an uphill battle. But with the last couple of things he's pulled off, he's really shown that he's a mover and a shaker. For this team and this organization, this is a big step. Lewis may want to start coaching."
Calipari acknowledged that the team lacked leadership on the floor. "Marbury is a fighter," he said. "He's a warrior. He's a leader. He's fearless. I talked to him tonight and he talked about us getting better defensively. I almost fell off my chair."
For the Timberwolves, a team that this season boasted a handful of young, promising players, the loss of Marbury amounts to another lesson in the hard world of surviving as a small-market team in the N.B.A. While Minnesota was willing to pay Marbury the maximum salary allowed under the new collective bargaining agreement, roughly $70 million for six years, it was not appealing or lucrative enough for a player who wanted to play in New York.
Minnesota had hoped to build a contender around the young nucleus of Marbury, Kevin Garnett and Tom Gugliotta, but with Gugliotta's departure as a free agent only Garnett remains.
For the Nets and for Marbury, the move involves some risk. Investing in players who grew up and made their names in the area has backfired twice already for the Nets. In the mid-1980's, they drafted Pearl Washington, who had played at Boys and Girls High School in Brooklyn, only to see him fail to develop into a quality professional player. Then, in 1991, they drafted Kenny Anderson, a former all-city high school player at Archbishop Molloy in Queens, but traded him in 1996 after several erratic years.
For Marbury, a return to New York brings the security and comfort of his family and friends, but also all the accompanying distractions. Then, too, there is the pressure that comes with the attention of being a star in one's home city. Anderson, with the Nets, and Mark Jackson with the Knicks were two New Yorkers who struggled.
Marbury did not seem fazed. "It's New York but it's not New York," he said in an interview with WFAN radio yesterday. "It's New Jersey. When people think about the New Jersey Nets, the first thing they think is that's the other New York team."
As a high school star and schoolyard legend, Marbury lived in the Coney Island projects and was one of the more accomplished and well-chronicled schoolboy basketball success stories. The fourth of five talented brothers, Marbury succeeded where his three older brothers did not, making the leaps from high school prodigy to college star at Georgia Tech to an elite performer in the N.B.A.
Marbury, following in the footsteps of his brothers, played at Lincoln, starting as a freshman and taking the team to three city championship games. As a junior, after the city championship game had been interrupted by a melee at Madison Square Garden, Marbury was the person school officials turned to to restore order, asking him to speak to the crowd by public-address system. As a senior, Marbury led the Lincoln team to the city championship.
The Nets expect to sign Marbury today to a six-year contract extension, worth $70.875 million, the maximum amount allowable under the league's new collective bargaining agreement. Minnesota had offered Marbury the same deal, but his aversion to Minnesota's climate and lifestyle led him to reject the offer and plan to test the free-agent market after the season. Given the option of trading Marbury for the best possible player or losing him for nothing in return at season's end, Minnesota took the best deal available.
The rest of yesterday's deal was complex. Cassell and Gatling go to Milwaukee, which sends its point guard, Terrell Brandon, to Minnesota. From the Nets, Minnesota gets Evans and a first-round draft pick. They have until April 1 to decide whether to take the first-round pick in 1999; if they decide not to, they get the No. 1 pick next year and an additional pick in 2003.
In addition to Marbury, Minnesota sends the Nets Bill Curley, whom the Nets immediately waived, and Chris Carr, a small forward. And Milwaukee sends the Nets Elliot Perry, a backup point guard.

Connecticut Jobs Czar

BYLINE: AP 

 BODY:
A former lawyer in the Rowland administration has been appointed "jobs czar" for Connecticut to oversee various job training programs and find ways to curb a severe labor shortage that threatens to cripple economic growth.
The new appointee, Mary Ann Hanley, will lead a study group that focuses on educational programs, welfare-to-work initiatives and job training. 
 The Connecticut Business and Industry Association, which sponsored a business forum at the Capitol this week, said business leaders welcomed the effort.
"As the economy has improved, and as the population has not grown and has aged, it's put a real need on developing a work force," said John Rathgeber, executive vice president of the association. "Our greatest asset is the productivity of Connecticut employees."

HEADLINE: PHOTOGRAPHY REVIEW;
Out of India: History and Beauty in a Colonial Context

BYLINE: By VICKI GOLDBERG 

 BODY:
Before Indian independence, some Britons seemed to think that Queen Victoria had acquired the subcontinent almost by default. After all, the East India Company had taken direct control of 60 percent of India and indirect control of most of the rest by the mid-19th century, and in 1857, the Indians finally rebelled. The Great Rebellion, also known as the Indian Mutiny, ensued; British firepower won; the company failed, and what was the Crown to do but step in?
Victoria was fascinated by the jewel in her crown, and so were her subjects. She hired Indian servants, one of whom became quite influential. Photographs show the Queen at table with Indian manservants standing by, looking suitably foreign and imposing; pictures of the Queen being served by representatives of her largest colony must have been a matter of some pride to the populace. She also sent British artists abroad to paint the newest members of her realm. 
 But photography was the great recorder of the age and the medium of choice in a land that not only entranced and enriched the British but also bewildered them by never being quite what it seemed. Britons, other foreigners and large numbers of Indians all hastened to register India's astonishing variety and explore the countries at its borders. Right now you can see more than 100 photographs, mostly from India, ranging from daguerreotypes to silver prints to hand-painted portraits, in "Re-Orientations: Photography From South Asia, 1845-1920" at Sepia International and the Alkazi Collection in Chelsea.
This space, which opened last month, is a highly unusual combination of museum and commercial gallery. The Alkazi Collection, more than 40,000 photographs of South Asia, belongs to Ebrahim Alkazi, an Indian who was director of the National School of Drama and of the Asian Theater Institute in New Delhi for 15 years. In 1986 he founded the Center for International Contemporary Arts in New York, which closed in 1992. His photographs and a research library are available to scholars at this space, and lectures, films and publications are planned. The exhibition space, with close to 2,000 square feet, will have one or two not-for-sale historical exhibitions drawn from the collection each year, like "Re-Orientations," plus several commercial shows of established and emerging artists.
Photography reached India less than a year after its invention in 1839. By 1865, an exhibition there attracted thousands of photographs, both amateur and professional, from all parts of the country. "Re-Orientations" includes superb works by foreigners and Indians alike, from Samuel Bourne's 1869 photograph of exuberantly rearing horses on a temple facade to Johnson and Hoffmann's debonair portrait of the boy Maharajah of Jodhpur, who must have glittered when he walked, to anonymous hand-painted portraits of men with rambunctious beards.
Not every image reaches this level, and there's a fair amount of material of more historical than esthetic interest. But the show has a broader target than mere beauty; the catalogue and wall texts excerpted from it try to place the imagery within the context of British dominion and domination. This is illuminating, especially for those not thoroughly versed in Indian history. The ideas are provocative; the photographs do not always bear them out as thoroughly as they might.
For example, a wall text reads: "The rebellion was the first instance when the camera was used as a political instrument to assert the authority of the ruling power and to proclaim its triumph to the world at large. Coming as it did soon after Britain's loss of its American colonies, the propagation of imperial success in India was important as a booster of morale." If this claim is correct, it makes the British the originators of one of the more insidious uses of photography. Looking at photographs of destruction -- Felice Beato's pictures of the dead in the rebellion, not shown in "Re-Orientations," were the most grisly images of war victims to date -- as part of a political program reflects up-to-date thinking about photography. It is especially intriguing here, for just two years earlier British pictures of the Crimean War were at least partially designed as Government propaganda.
Photographs of destruction during the rebellion and of British retribution for it may have done exactly what this text suggests, but it is hard to know how two lovely pictures of an Indian fort, apparently intact, contributed to the effort. Then, too, pictures of wartime damage tend to get tangled in double messages of victory and viciousness. George Barnard's photographs of the South in ruins after the American Civil War bear, at least in our time, a mixed message about the Northern conquest. But today, as images are re-evaluated and the question of who controls them rethought, it is possible to read many of the travel photographs of the 19th century as exercises in colonial power. The attitude is: We own that rich or beautiful or exotic land (or else we ought to), and we are clearly superior to those people, charming as they may be, and are providing them the beneficent guidance of our highly developed civilization.
Certainly the photographs of the celebrations of 1877, when Victoria was proclaimed Empress of India; of 1903, when Edward VII was proclaimed Emperor, and of 1911, when King George V and Queen Mary were the first British monarchs to visit the country, were intended to underline the majesty, pomp and authority of the sovereigns. That's what coronations and entries into cities have always been about, and the camera has merely provided an economical way to record them and distribute the news.
As the wall texts and catalogue in "Re-Orientations" point out, ethnography and anthropology were comparatively new sciences in the late 19th century, and photographers fanned out across the fringe lands in and around India to photograph the diversity of tribes and races. The Government moved in on this undertaking. Lord Canning, the first Viceroy of India, set in motion the documentation of all the peoples of the subcontinent, apparently as a souvenir for officials returning home, but by 1858 the Political and Secret Department of the Government of India (what is a Secret Department?) already had a vivid interest in this undertaking and would eventually buy half the published sets. Ethnographers, anthropologists, criminologists and phrenologists had theories about facial and other physical features that supported the notion of a superior white race; these kinds of photographs bolstered such ideas and were sometimes taken with them in mind.
Still, the pictures are historically important and sometimes visually striking, which need not be forgotten any more than the beauty of a great work of architecture need be ignored because it was commissioned by a tyrant. When it came to photographing the local rulers, some local photographers -- there were already Indian-run studios in the 1850's -- or at least some local artists may have had the best of it. The painted portraits in this show, which can resemble Indian miniatures much as American painted tintypes can mimic folk paintings, are delicious, with faces and hands in black and white and costumes in brilliant colors, or pearl necklaces painted atop the gentlemen's very Western jackets and ties.
India's monuments are dizzyingly varied and disconcertingly breath-taking, and only someone both blind and flinty-hearted could fail to admire an anonymous photographer's picture of marble inlays, delicate as painted porcelain, in the Red Fort in Delhi or Colin Murray's 1873 image of the Lake Palace in Udaipur, with its lilting reflections and gentle mountains. Such photographs, generally made for military families, tourists and stay-at-home British citizens, also constituted a large, if not strictly organized, architectural and archeological survey of the country and conceivably helped preserve the glories of India's history. Happily, a number of the monuments are as awesome today as they were when photographers first looked at them.
Photographers also trekked into uncharted territories and made the earliest pictures of the Tibetan Himalayas, including Everest. Or they domesticated what could be tamed, finding vantage points that turned a foreign landscape into the familiar kind of picturesque composition that painters had made popular back home, as Samuel Bourne did when picturing Europeans in Naini Tal looking at what might have been a manicured, transplanted piece of good old England.
If you cannot get to India soon, you could do worse than take a peek at its history in photographs.
"Re-Orientations: Photography From South Asia, 1845-1920" remains at Sepia International Inc. and the Alkazi Collection of Photography, 148 West 24th Street, Chelsea, through April 24.

HEADLINE: RJR Nabisco, An Epilogue

BYLINE: By Bryan Burrough; Bryan Burrough is the co-author, with John Helyar, of "Barbarians at the Gate: The Fall of RJR Nabisco," and the author of "Dragonfly: NASA and the Crisis Aboard Mir."

 BODY:
Like Stanley Kubrick and Joe DiMaggio, RJR Nabisco died this week. The 14-year-old company, formed in 1985 by the ill-conceived merger of the R. J. Reynolds tobacco conglomerate and the Nabisco food corporation, is to be broken up, its foreign cigarette company sold to the Japanese so that Nabisco can once more go its own way, alone.
It is a story that, were it not for the furious 1988 bidding battle that culminated in the company's $25 billion leveraged buyout, the largest in history, would never have escaped the business pages. But the events of that autumn 11 years ago insure that RJR Nabisco will rank high in the century's pantheon of financial ignominy. 
 The pundits are saying it is the end of an era, and so it is. How raw it all seems today, now that hostile takeovers are passe and Michael Milken campaigns against prostate cancer, that the nation's 19th-largest company became a piece of meat for the leading investment bankers to snarl over.
First into the fray was Peter Cohen, the chairman of Shearson Lehman, itself now divided and long forgotten. Mr. Cohen, working with RJR's flamboyant president, F. Ross Johnson, was determined to grab a piece of Wall Street's exploding buyout business for himself.
This outraged the acknowledged prince of the buyout business, Henry Kravis, of Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Company, who summoned Mr. Cohen to his midtown Manhattan office and sought a portion, on the order of 100 percent, of the brewing deal. This bit of incivility, and the multibillion-dollar takeover offer Mr. Kravis made in its wake, ignited a fire that within days consumed all of Wall Street.
When business historians look back at the 1980's, they will no doubt point to the numbers, to the weaknesses in its core businesses, to explain why RJR Nabisco failed. And they will be right. As a platform on which to pile several billion dollars of debt, the tobacco business, soon to be beset by pricing wars and an avalanche of litigation during the 1990's, was never sufficiently stable.
But the real story of RJR Nabisco was and always will be the people who made it fail. Business journalists are sometimes criticized for "personalizing" their subjects, and, yes, it's not terribly relevant whether Bill Gates likes his martinis shaken or stirred. But RJR stands as a reminder, if we need one, that it is human beings and not computers or balance sheets who make the decisions on which corporations live or die.
It was Ross Johnson who, annoyed in part by Nabisco's lagging stock price, spearheaded the original plan to merge with R. J. Reynolds, a company in the same plight. This reasoning was not unlike marrying two lepers in hopes of somehow curing their disease. Prodded by the fee-hungry investment bankers who buzzed about him like horseflies, he seemed willing to try almost anything.
If a merger or restructuring failed, he famously reasoned, it just meant a few hundred people would lose their "portable" jobs or the company would lose a few million dollars. And "a few million dollars," Mr. Johnson said at the time, "are lost in the sands of time." When the merger failed to goose the combined companies' stock, Mr. Johnson came up with the idea for a leveraged buyout, which would have paid off all the public shareholders and taken the company private -- in effect, eliminating the stock problem.
Despite warnings that RJR was not fit for a leveraged buyout, Mr. Kravis began his blitzkrieg. The Cassandra-like speeches of his archrival, Theodore Forstmann, a general partner at the buyout firm of Forstmann, Little & Company, have stayed with me for years. As the bidding escalated that fall, Mr. Forstmann bowed out early, telling everyone who would listen that the deal just didn't make financial sense. And he was right. But in its overweening need to anoint a "winner," to treat a financial transaction as if it were the Stanley Cup, the business press, and here I include myself, didn't want to hear Mr. Forstmann's tiresome jeremiads.
RJR's demise is not without its ironies. Its chief executive today is Steven Goldstone -- Mr. Kravis bailed out in 1994 -- who was Mr. Johnson's primary legal adviser during his bid for the company in 1988. It was Mr. Goldstone who, during an afternoon at Mr. Johnson's Florida condo, tried in vain to persuade Mr. Johnson against attempting the buyout.
Mr. Goldstone is the author of the final chapter of the tale he never wanted written in the first place. Others may get a wry smile out of Carl Icahn's role in RJR's death. Like most of his fellow corporate raiders, Mr. Icahn has all but disappeared from the public eye since the 1980's. In fact, his success in pressuring Mr. Goldstone to split up the company is probably the most notable achievement by a raider this decade. It's fitting, as if RJR is being led into the darkness by the Ghost of Takeovers Past himself.
The legacy of RJR Nabisco was immediate and lasts to this day. It was the deal that was too big, too loud, too out of control. It was the one event that more than any other, more than Mr. Milken's jailing, more than the government investigations, ended the Roaring 80's, and for a simple reason that had nothing to do with balance sheets and everything to do with human beings.
RJR scared people, especially chief executives. While no one will shed tears for Mr. Johnson -- he did, after all, walk away from the company with a $50 million severance package -- his very public immolation persuaded hundreds of chief executives to tread more carefully where their companies' futures were concerned.
Of even greater significance was its effect on corporate boardrooms across the country. For the first time corporate directors began seriously questioning the harebrained schemes investment bankers brought before them. Until RJR, too many boards allowed Wall Street deal makers to lead them by the noses. The diminution of this power was a turning point in the drive toward greater corporate accountability, which, economic arguments aside, remains the most enduring lesson of Wall Street's decade of excess.

HEADLINE: Russian Philosophy Is Given Its Head;
Freed From the Orthodoxy of Marx and Lenin, Intellectuals Explore Limitless Possibilities

BYLINE: By PATRICIA COHEN 

DATELINE: MOSCOW

 BODY:
Vladimir Fedorovich Titov is not bitter. True, he was chairman of the department of Marxist-Leninist philosophy at the prestigious Moscow State University when the faculty voted in 1991, as he put it, to "liquidate completely" his department.
But as he explains: "We decided the question pacifically. Professors understood the political situation." He offers a gentle smile, revealing a gold tooth. His large ears and thick, rectangular glasses seem to have outgrown his cropped gray-haired head. This 60-year-old Marxist is now teaching existentialism. 
 "It was a great mistake," he says of his department's elimination. "Marx was a great thinker. Without him you can't do philosophy." The narrow faculty room with its mismatched chairs in neon-aqua tints is cold, and Mr. Titov warms himself with a cup of English breakfast tea. Gazing down from a photograph hanging above a tall wooden bookcase is Karl Marx, his face partly obscured by a plant.
For 70 years Russian philosophy was Marxism-Leninism. It was more than a dusty schoolroom requirement; it was the national religion, the source of the state's political authority and legitimacy. Vladimir Mironov, the chairman of Moscow University's philosophy department, remembers a teacher once telling him, "You get paid a high stipend not because you know philosophy, but because you're going to be an ideologue."
These days ideological work doesn't pay that well, and the benefits aren't great either. But no one knows yet what will replace it.
Of course, the old guard, professors like Mr. Titov, still have their teaching jobs, and some of the textbooks have changed nothing more than their titles. But Russian philosophy, freed from the Marxist straitjacket, is clumsily stretching its arms, testing its reach. Instead of looking at every problem through the lens of scientific socialism, philosophers can now reinvent themselves: they can be analytical or mystical, try logic or phenomenology. The ethics of political and economic success are suddenly acceptable subjects for ethicists, as are abortion and organ transplants. In epistemology, the study of knowledge, scholars can now examine a subject once off-limits, like the religious roots of science.
This freedom has pitched Russian philosophy both backward and forward. In some cases Russians have looked inward, sifting through their own past to rediscover the philosophical heritage that was suppressed during most of the Soviet period. Some have turned to the religious philosophy of the Christian Orthodox church, or re-examined the 19th-century notion of the "Russian idea," the nation's unique historical mission. Others have looked outside, to Europe's and America's post-modernists.
What philosophical school is most popular now? "What day is it?" Mr. Mironov responded with a laugh.
The "all of the above" option is, to some degree, precisely the point of a post-communist world. Yet as these and other ideas rush to fill the vacuum left by communism, the question is whether Russians will be tempted by a substitute orthodoxy.
"People understood Marx very dogmatically," explained Ruben Apressyan, who teaches at the Institute of Philosophy in Moscow, historically a more autonomous institution than Moscow State University. Now "they are replacing one set of axioms with another." In this sense, how the born-again field of philosophy develops is a bellwether of Russia's intellectual life in general, and of its ties to the country's politics and economy.
The most predictable impulse after the fall of communism was Russian scholars' desire to fill in the gaps of their history. Although some of the writings of homegrown philosophers like Vladimir Solovyov, Nikolai Berdyaev and Aleksei Losev began to be available in the Khrushchev era, they were often carefully controlled. You could talk about them, says El'mar Sokolov (whose parents chose E for Engels, L for Lenin, M for Marx), but you couldn't write about them.
Mr. Sokolov's thin face, gray hair and weathered pin-stripe suit are illuminated by St. Petersburg's iron-tinted afternoon light. Outside is the snowy garden he ran through as a boy during the Nazi siege of Leningrad; inside this professor's study are black-and-white photos of his family, Czars Alexander II and Nicholas II, and Berdyaev. Even though small public lectures on Berdyaev were allowed in the mid-80's, "a friend had problems because he said Berdyaev was more important that Lenin," Mr. Sokolov remembers. "He was fired, then sent to a bad university to teach. Then he emigrated."
Berdyaev, one of the best known Russian philosophers, turned his back on Marxism in 1922 and was deported to Paris, where he wrote about Russia's destiny as the new Jerusalem. The Russians, he said, were a special spiritual, organic people with a mission to transform society. Like many other intellectuals and writers he was deeply influenced by Solovyov, the 19th-century philosopher whose complete works are now being published for the first time. Solovyov, who coined the term "the Russian idea," had a mystical bent and saw Christianity as the repository of supreme wisdom.
The return of "the Russian idea" worries those who fear that a belief in Russia's exceptionalism could turn into a dangerous messianism. When many Russians feel humiliated, the notion of a divine mission offers psychological compensation.
It also initially seemed to set the stage for a replay of the tug of war between nationalist, conservative Slavophiles and progressive, secular Westernizers, a struggle that Dostoyevsky savagely satirized in his 1872 novel "Demons."
Yet this opposition between East and West has often been exaggerated. The simple idea that Russia has a unique character, a particular "Russkii mentalitet," appeals not only to fierce nationalists, but also to religious leaders, poets, anti-communists (who see Marx as a Western import), as well as young, liberal Western-educated scholars who don't want to see Russia's form squished into a one-size-fits-all American-style suit.
That is particularly true at the moment, when Western-style liberalism has taken such a battering here. Instead of rose-colored glasses, many Russians now see the West through what Mr. Apressyan calls "gray glasses." Intellectuals in Moscow and St. Petersburg agreed.
"There is a disenchantment with Western liberal ideology," said Vladimir Lektorsky, editor of the leading philosophy journal, Voprosy Filosofii (Problems of Philosophy). "Liberalism was reduced only to minimal government and private property, with disastrous results." In theory and practice liberalism itself had turned into a kind of dogma. And corruption, poverty, a dwindling industrial base and agricultural system, and governmental chaos hadn't exactly help salvage the capitalist dream.
One Western import that has captured the imagination of the younger generation of scholars, however, is French post-modernism. "Every second person considers himself a postmodernist," Mr. Mironov said.
In many ways post-modernism seems the perfect philosophy for a post-communist society. After years of listening to the ruling party dish out the "Truth," post-modernism's insistence on competing notions of truth is a refreshing change. Its skepticism of authority extends to Western assumptions about the straight path of progress and universal values. Thus, those who hold on to a sense of Russia's uniqueness are drawn to it as well.
Anna Kostikova, 34, teaches at Moscow State University and has a ready giggle. She chose contemporary French post-modernism as her speciality even before the Soviet Union was disbanded. Post-modernism is not necessarily the most popular field, she said, but it does characterize the country's state of mind.
"You can't not be a post-modernist in contemporary Russia," she said, her dark brown hair haphazardly tied back. "Our country is very unstable both economically and politically, and no ideology can be adequate to the situation. In this sense post-modernism is being realized not as a popular philosophy but as the acceptance of various philosophies and their existence."
Svetalan Shakirova, 31, also considers herself a post-modernist. She got interested in philosophy after reading "Das Kapital" in the eighth grade, but she wrote her thesis on the idea of male and female in philosophy. Philosophy is the "science of elderly men," she says through a translator. Perhaps. Yet she and 10 colleagues also from Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan (formerly part of the Soviet empire), nonetheless traveled 1,500 miles to St. Petersburg for a seminar on gender theory.
This unfamiliar intellectual stew has fed anxiety about the future of Russian intellectual life. This generation of scholars is a transitional one; what will the next one bring?
Intellectual life has suffered from the loss of state support. Gone are the comfortable salaries, subsidized journals, research grants and other perks. A senior professor now earns $100 to $200 a month; circulation of the once subsidized Viprosy Filosofii has fallen to 7,000 from 85,000 in 1990. At St. Petersburg University the philosophy faculty's phone service was cut off for several months in 1997 because no one paid the bill.
Yet intellectuals have also suffered from the loss of an authority to fight. In a repressive society, defiant writers and thinkers carried moral authority; they were prophets who could speak truth to power. No more.
"There's already a crisis of confidence in intellectuals," Ms. Kostikova said. "People don't trust them." Nikita Pokrovsky, a Jefferson scholar and sociologist who, like most professors in Russia has had to stitch together three teaching jobs to survive, is pessimistic. "In about a decade or earlier, the quality of teaching and research will decline dramatically," he said. Only 1 or 2 percent of his students end up pursuing an academic career. "You can make 10 times as much as a secretary. We're seeing the degradation of the intelligentsia."
Mr. Pokrovsky repeats the litany of complaints: Students are blockheads; juicy pulp fiction has replaced serious literature; jobs are scarce and money more so; talk of the ruble has replaced the "kitchen discussions," philosophical nights at which shots of vodka, cigarettes and rich conversation would be consumed. Students "can buy abridged versions of Tolstoy and Dostoyevsky," said Mr. Mironov. "You have speed-reading courses everywhere; but how can you read Heidigger that way?"
To others, such gloomy ruminations are more suited to Russian literature than life.
Marietta Stepaniants, 63, who heads the Oriental Philosophy Department at the Institute of Philosophy, says intellectual life is not only vital, but expansive. Over tea in her uncommonly bright office, with its varnished wooden floor and new computer, she said that when she published a book on Sufism in 1987, it was the first on the subject; people stood in line to buy a copy. Now there are several in print. If Russians don't queue up for serious books today, she says, "all it means is we didn't publish enough."
Perhaps because she saw how her own thinking evolved in difficult times, she is more optimistic about the next generation of intellectuals. As a teen-ager she cried when Stalin died, almost getting trampled in the scramble to see his coffin. A trip to India in 1959 and a stay in the United States in 1961 with Quakers introduced her to unaccustomed ideas. And she began to change.
What she then said about her own past might also apply to the future: "I was not a revolutionary or a dissident, but I developed."

HEADLINE: Pulaski County Journal;
A Virginia Town's Boom Is Not All It Hoped For

BYLINE: By MICHAEL JANOFSKY 

DATELINE: DUBLIN, Va.

 BODY:
For rural Pulaski County, it was like a dream come true: Volvo, the automobile maker, decided last year to expand its truck-making plant here, a plan that would double the size of the work force to 2,500 and add an estimated 1,200 jobs in related businesses.
It was the sort of economic boon that county leaders had been striving for through an aggressive program of state and local tax incentives to attract new businesses. Not that Pulaski County was desperate for such growth. 
 Tucked into the southwestern corner of Virginia, the county stands out as a pocket of economic diversity. Rolling hills of farmland and forests surround busy factories that have made textiles, furniture and munitions for almost a century. But the more vigorous the growth, the better, county officials have long believed.
Now, though, some of them, along with other county residents, are wondering whether an old saw -- be careful what you wish for -- might apply to them. While a plant expansion is something other rural counties love to contemplate, people in Pulaski County are grappling with the flip side of a dream come true.
Volvo's expansion is certain to increase the county's population, 34,000, planners say, leading some officials to question the possible ill effects on businesses, schools and the overall quality of life.
"On the whole, there is extremely good news here, with many more options locally so people don't have to leave the region to get good paying jobs," said David A. Cox, the county's superintendent of public schools. "But there are going to be some growing pains we have to deal with."
Last year, Virginia ranked as one of the leading states in new jobs, with 90,000, and one of the lowest in unemployment, with a rate of 2.7 percent. State officials say so many technology companies have recently opened or expanded that they have openings in 25,000 positions.
Pulaski County lies in a region that joined the economic parade only recently, largely through the state grants and tax incentives. Volvo expanded in Pulaski after the state offered a tax package worth $56 million over 10 years.
But the owners of other businesses worry that the Volvo expansion could hurt them by luring away their best workers. Jobs at the Volvo plant can pay more than $40,000 a year, a handsome income in a county where the Census Bureau puts the median value of a house at $51,400, well below the national median, $140,000.
The business owners are typically able to pay much less than Volvo and offer fewer benefits.
"I'm sure they'll take people from us," said David B. Spangler, president and chief executive of Jefferson Mills, a textile plant that employs 320 people in the town of Pulaski. "They already have, and they'll take my younger and better people. Anybody they take will start earning twice as much as we pay after we've trained them."
Mr. Spangler said he was not sure where he might find replacements.
Tim D. Thompson, vice president of a company that makes church pews, says that when he needs new workers, he walks around downtown Pulaski and hires men off the street.
But county officials expect some new workers to move into Pulaski County, a prospect certain to accelerate a rise in housing costs that began about a year ago, around the time the Volvo expansion was announced. Volvo has already hired about 500 workers and the rest are to be phased in over the next few years.
Wayne McGlothlin, the owner of a Century 21 real estate agency, said a chronic shortage of housing listings in the county, combined with the rising demand, had already pushed up the sale price of houses by 47 percent in the last year alone.
"There's already a housing shortage," said Gerald E. Bolen, a salesman in the Century 21 office. "We're seeing more new construction, but for hourly people, it takes two incomes to move into a house in the $175,000 range."
Mr. Spangler predicted that the lack of affordable housing could become a major impediment for companies like his trying to recruit new workers. "They need to build houses here that cost less than $60,000 and that's even pushing it for a worker making $20,000," he said. "What they ought to be thinking about, maybe, is trailer parks. Nothing wrong with trailer parks."
No one is watching the influx more closely than Mr. Cox, the schools superintendent. This year, 5,075 children in the county attend eight elementary schools, two middle schools and the high school. The overall student-to-teacher ratio is a comfortable 20 to 1.
Two years ago, the county passed a $44.5 million plan to renovate every school over the next 10 years. But Mr. Cox said that as few as 400 children added to the system would cause overcrowding that could lead to a decline in test results.
"A lot of folks are talking about this and what it means," he said of the county's job creation. "We just don't know yet."
Local leaders are also grappling with how to spruce up the town of Pulaski, the largest in the county, with about 10,000 residents. For now, Pulaski has little to offer in way of shopping, restaurants and recreation; and Dublin, with a population of about 2,000, even less. On any given day in Pulaski, more stores along Main Street, the retail center, are closed than open, and empty sidewalks suggest that none are especially thriving.
Rebecca English, the owner of MimiAnne's Gourmet Coffee Shop, is president of the Pulaski Downtown Merchants' Association, which has taken on a number of projects to pump new life into the town, including an effort to turn an abandoned roller-skating rink into a fine arts center and an old movie theater into a performing arts center.
Ms. English said progress was slow because local residents had long grown accustomed to seeking culture, entertainment and shopping a short drive away in the larger towns of Radford, Blacksburg and Christiansburg.
"We're on the cusp of something really exciting if we can get all the pieces together," she said. "If what is scheduled to happen happens, this town can be transformed."

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS;
Dow Slips by 21.09 Points After Approaching 10,000

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
The Dow Jones industrial average paused in its climb toward 10,000 yesterday as technology stocks, which have propelled Wall Street higher in recent weeks, turned into an obstacle the market could not surmount.
The Dow came within 42 points of 10,000 before giving up ground and closing at 9,876.35, down 21.09. Broader market indicators were also lower. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 3.09, to 1,294.59. 
 Disappointing news from Microsoft and the software maker Oracle set off broad selling in technology stocks. The technology-laden Nasdaq composite index fell 30.72, to 2,381.53.
Oracle, down 8 5/16 , to 28 9/16 , said third-quarter sales fell short of analyst expectations. Microsoft slipped 1 1/4, to 160 3/16 , after announcing it would defer about $400 million in revenue from its third quarter to its fourth quarter.
The news from both companies came as an unpleasant surprise to a stock market that has surged largely on enthusiasm about high-technology and Internet companies. For many, hints of trouble in technology stocks are an impetus to take profits.
"Most people think we need the tech stocks to push the market through 10,000," said Robert Freedman, executive vice president for John Hancock Funds in Boston.
Nonetheless, he was optimistic. "We will get to 10,000," he said. "The market has shown a lot of resiliency."
There was enough bad news yesterday to depress the market whether or not it was moving toward a new psychological barrier. The construction equipment maker Caterpillar, a component of the Dow average, warned that its first-quarter results would fall far short of expectations because of lower machine and engine sales. Shares of Caterpillar fell 6 3/16 , to 44 11/16 .
Oil stocks, which rose earlier this week, generally reversed course. Analysts questioned whether production cuts announced by major oil-exporting countries would actually support higher prices.
"I'm not sure we want to rely on oil stocks to push the market higher," Mr. Freedman said. "We need the old favorites, the big caps and technology."
Steven Goldman, market strategist with Weeden & Company in Greenwich, Conn., said he expected the market to hit 10,000 soon, but that with the advance confined to several dozen big stocks, further gains would be difficult. "There's just not much breadth," he said.
Yesterday's pullback, which followed a 124.60-point gain in the Dow on Thursday, might have been expected as Wall Street approached a new milestone. As the blue chips reached 1,000-point marks in the past, stock traders often took profits, perhaps expecting that other investors might become nervous and bail out once the big number was actually reached.
One of the biggest New York Stock Exchange decliners was the pharmacy chain Rite Aid, which fell 14 7/16 , to 22 9/16 , after warning that higher expansion expenses would curtail first-quarter earnings.

 	 	 		--------------------	 	
 
Treasury Prices Rise
 (By Bloomberg News)
Bond prices rose yesterday, capping the best week in two months, after a Government report on producer prices showed that inflation remained tame.
"We were delighted" by the report, said Zane Brown, a fixed-income portfolio manager at Lord, Abbett & Company in New York. Inflation is "very well contained," he said.
Bonds gained after the Government said that prices paid to factories, farms and other producers fell four-tenths of 1 percent in February. The report rallied Treasuries even as Charter Communications Holdings L.L.C. sold $3.58 billion of debt, the biggest sale this decade from a company rated below investment grade.
The 30-year Treasury bond rose 19/32 , to 96 3/32 . Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction, fell to 5.51 percent, from 5.56 percent.
Treasury gains were limited by a rise in crude oil prices, which raised concern over the possibility of higher inflation later in 1999. Crude oil, used to make everything from gasoline to garbage bags, has risen nearly 25 percent so far this year, and hit a five-month high yesterday.

HEADLINE: Ads Attack Pataki's Plan On Hospitals

BYLINE: By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA

DATELINE: ALBANY, March 12

 BODY:
Attacking Gov. George E. Pataki directly for the first time in four years, hospitals and health care workers began a broadcast campaign today asserting that the Governor's proposed budget cuts would have dire consequences for health care, including hospital closings.
The effort began with a 60-second radio advertisement in the New York metropolitan region and in Albany, and its sponsors say that in trying to raise a public outcry to defeat the cuts, they are prepared to expand the campaign to other parts of the state and to television, and to spend millions of dollars. 
 After two years in which he did not press for significant changes in Medicaid, the health insurance program for the poor, Mr. Pataki called this year for $800 million in cuts, despite a state budget surplus expected to top $2 billion. Most of those cuts would come in lower payments to hospitals and nursing homes.
Mr. Pataki is not the only one making a sharp turnabout. The same health care industry leaders who are assailing the Republican Governor had built a cautiously friendly relationship with him over the last few years, and there was a hint in their comments today that they feel betrayed.
"When the economy has never been better, the state has a huge surplus and so many hospitals are in financial trouble, why now does the Governor want to begin pummeling a major industry?" asked Kenneth E. Raske, president of the Greater New York Hospital Association, a trade group of 175 hospitals and nursing homes in the New York metropolitan region. "It is incomprehensible to us. It isn't good economics, it isn't good health care and it isn't good politics."
Michael McKeon, Mr. Pataki's press secretary, said: "New York spends more than $28 billion on health care, more than any other state in the nation. The Governor's budget maintains New York's national leadership in health care."
The state's largest group of health care workers, and one of its most politically powerful unions, 1199, the National Health and Human Service Employees Union, remained neutral in Mr. Pataki's re-election campaign last year. At the height of that campaign, the president of the 120,000-member union, Dennis Rivera, stood by the Governor's side and praised him warmly for expanding the state's health insurance program for poor children.
Now, a coalition led by Mr. Rivera and Mr. Raske hopes to reprise its effort of 1995, Mr. Pataki's first year in office, when it leveled an advertising attack on the Governor, his popularity plummeted and he backed away from some of the deep cuts in Medicaid he was proposing.
But it will be much harder to damage the Governor this time. Four years ago, he was an unknown quantity, easily tarred as an unfeeling archconservative. Today, he is better known, highly popular, widely seen as a moderate, and fresh from a resounding re-election victory.
The new ad says: "Governor Pataki's $1 billion in health care cuts will force some hospitals to close. They will mean fewer nurses, less care in nursing homes, and they'll devastate the high quality of care we expect when we get sick."
Its sponsors say that the initial purchase of air time is $125,000 for the first week, comparable to the rate of spending in a political campaign, and that the ad will be heard on the New York City radio stations WINS, WCBS, WOR, WBLI and WQXR, among others. The coalition says it is also sending mailings to 250,000 homes. "We're ready to go to TV after that," said Ken Sunshine, a political consultant advising the coalition. "We're prepared for a multimillion-dollar campaign."
The confrontation parallels a continuing battle of perception over the financial health of the state's hospitals. Business groups and the Pataki administration point to a report saying that New York's hospitals posted record profits in 1997. The health care industry counters that the state's hospitals still lag far behind those in other states in profitability; they contend that 1998 was a tough year for them and that 1999 will prove even worse.
"We've got thousands of health care workers who are in danger of losing their health insurance because their employers can't pay the premiums, because H.M.O.'s aren't paying their bills on time and the number of uninsured people is rising," Mr. Rivera said. Many more workers, he said, face layoffs if the condition of hospitals worsens.
Over the last several years, hospitals, nursing homes and health care workers in New York have lost billions of dollars to Medicaid cuts made here in Albany and to Medicare cuts made in Washington. Those have been partly offset by increased Federal subsidies to the hospitals and by cuts in their state taxes.
This year, business groups are lobbying for a sharp reduction in state surcharges on hospital bills, which, in turn, raise the health insurance rates employers pay. Most of the money goes to hospitals to pay for care for the uninsured and the training of new doctors.
This week, the Assembly Speaker, Sheldon Silver, a Manhattan Democrat, proposed reversing some of the 1995 Medicaid cuts, rejecting all of the Governor's proposed cuts this year and adding a few new health care programs. He called for $1.3 billion more in health care spending than Mr. Pataki did. But health care advocates were dismayed that Mr. Silver's plan would leave in place $600 million a year of the 1995 cuts.

HEADLINE: Facing Shortage, Builders And Labor Court Workers

BYLINE: By DIRK JOHNSON

DATELINE: CHICAGO, March 12

 BODY:
Reared in the poverty of a bleak housing project, Arthur Murray, 29, had kicked around for years with two boyhood pals -- "Now one's dead and one's in prison" -- before finding his way to the carpenter's union hall. Now an apprentice, he is headed toward a $27-an-hour job.
Helen Alex, 43, searching for a job after a recent divorce, knew that supporting two children on the wages of a secretary or a waitress would be daunting. Always handy around the house, she landed a job in the building trades as a carpenter. 
 Michael Giron, 29, who came to the United States from Mexico as a boy, once viewed plumbers, carpenters and bricklayers as "just big white guys." But now he wears the hard-hat and steel-toed boots of a carpenter, and the union people tell him that his ability to speak Spanish as well as English will be a help on the construction site, not a hindrance.
Faced with a shortage of trades workers to meet the voracious demand for construction in the United States, desperate builders and eager unions have begun aggressive campaigns to court new workers, attracting women and members of racial minorities to the traditional bastion of white men, a world where a coveted union card was handed from father to son.
The Chicago-area carpenters union is investing $15,000-a-year in each trainee in its apprenticeship program and last December opened a $3.5 million training center in a poverty-scarred neighborhood on the city's South Side.
Besides broadening the labor pool, leaders in the construction field are working to enhance the image of the trades worker, a career path that has often lost out to the prestige of a college education or the dazzle of the high-tech fields. But many school counselors are starting to urge some students to give a second look to the trades, jobs that often pay $50,000 a year to workers with a high school education, offer a sense of accomplishment and have family-friendly work hours.
"As a society, we have come to view these as hard, dirty jobs," said Jim Turffs, a high school career counselor in Oregon, Ill. "There's a stigma that if you wear jeans and a T-shirt, you're not as intelligent. But these are good jobs, paying good money. And you know, there are some drawbacks to being stuck at a desk for 10 hours a day, too."
In recent months, the unemployment rate among skilled trades workers has fallen below 6 percent, the lowest level on record. A shortage of skilled workers ranks as the most serious problem facing contractors, according to a survey by the National Association of Home Builders, a trade group in Washington.
"It's the No. 1 problem all over the country," said Tom Woods, a builder in a suburb of Kansas City, Mo., who leads the association's new task force on the labor shortage.
Mr. Woods said the worker deficit had driven up labor costs, especially in overtime wages, and often forced customers to wait six months, or even a year, to move into a new house, compared with the traditional 60-day wait.
As just about anyone knows who needs to build an addition, renovate a kitchen, or even fix a dripping bathroom faucet, it is sometimes nearly impossible to get through to a trades worker. They are overwhelmed with work.
The survey by the builders group in December found that 87 percent of contractors reported shortages of carpenters and that the situation was worst in the Midwest and Northeast. The report also found that 75 percent of contractors reported "significantly higher costs of labor" in the last year.
Derek Graham, a project manager for a New York City builder, said his customers must wait at least 12 weeks for work to begin. A few years ago, people sometimes waited only a week or so, Mr. Graham said.
"Electricians are so busy they don't have time to bid jobs," said Mr. Graham, who works for 3-D Laboratory. "And you can't find anybody down at the union hall. They're all out working."
More than 90 percent of the builders surveyed expressed concerns about the quality of available skilled trades workers. Some builders said they had absorbed higher labor costs because work had been done improperly and needed to be redone.
Ken Klein, a builder in Tulsa, Okla., said his company, Kleinco., had been forced to turn away business, because it lacked enough skilled workers, and he worried that the problem could worsen, as the average age of trades workers increases.
"I look out at my carpenters, and they're mostly in their 40's," Mr. Klein said. "This used to be a young man's game."
The failure to attract more young people into the building trades, in the view of industry and labor officials, stems partly from the decline of vocational education in public schools. High schools that once offered courses in automotive work or building trades, for example, have increasingly come to measure themselves in terms of the percentages of students they send to college.
"We beat into their heads that unless you get a college education, you're a failure," said Mr. Woods, the builder and task force leader. "We, as a society, have failed young people by giving them that message."
Schools that retained the industrial arts, in some cases, used the shop floor as a place to send misfits.
"If you had an unruly kid," Mr. Woods said, "there was this idea, 'We'll just make a bricklayer or a carpenter out of him.' "
The decline in the appeal of working in the trades, all sides of the construction field agree, stems in large part from the plebeian image of manual labor in American society, where the work force increasingly sits in front of a computer screen.
On television and in movies, industry and labor leaders say, trades workers have often been lampooned, depicted as overweight men in ill-fitting clothes, speaking in fractured grammar and holding benighted social views.
The reality on the construction site today is far more diverse. Alesia Cherry, 28, a carpenter apprentice who was framing metal studs at one of the union's training sites on a recent afternoon, teaches English at night at the University of Chicago.
"My grandfather was a carpenter," Ms. Cherry said, adding, with a laugh, "Of course, he probably wouldn't think a woman should be doing this kind of work."
Her love of books, she said, hardly meant that she could not also find gratification in the construction of roof trusses. For centuries, the artisans in the building crafts were among the most highly regarded workers in Europe, she noted. Ms. Cherry said she would continue to teach after becoming a carpenter.
Another apprentice in the carpenter's program, Steve Wilson, 27, is a social worker with a degree from Illinois State University. He worked with young men who were offenders and simply grew weary of the stress and the long odds of success.
"Now I start work at 6 A.M. and I'm done at 2:30 P.M., and I can look at something and say, 'I built that,' " Mr. Wilson said. "Besides that, it pays better."
For some young people of working-class backgrounds, it is the very success of the building trades that has propelled them in a different direction. They are the children of carpenters, plumbers or bricklayers who were able to give their families the comforts of middle-class life, and the aspirations to go even higher.
Tim Ball, a high school senior in Oregon, Ill., is the son and grandson of tool-and-die tradesmen, a young man who has great respect for the craft that pays more than $40,000 a year. But he will be enrolling in a private college this fall.
"I want to be a lawyer," said Mr. Ball, who is drawn to history, government and politics. "It was just always assumed that I would go to college."
Builders and unions are making greater efforts to speak to high school students at career days, hoping to portray a life in the trades in a favorable light.
Mr. Woods said builders were emphasizing the appeal of the working hours, noting that it is the carpenters and plumbers who have time to coach Little League and soccer games in the early evening. In addition, he said, young people need to know that technological advances have made construction work a bit less physically taxing. Carpenters often use nail guns, for example.
"Physical labor is still involved, but not nearly like it used to be," Mr. Woodssaid.
Jeffrey Isaacson, the vice president of the district that governs unions for 32,000 carpenters in the Chicago area, meanwhile, stresses the benefits of trade union work. He noted that carpenters now receive pensions of about $1,000 a month.
In its apprenticeship program, the union even gives trainees a $300 tool allowance. Apprentices start training at an indoor site for nine weeks, practicing before going out to jobs. As trainees, they earn about $10 an hour. Their wages increase gradually over five years to the journeyman level, now about $27 an hour.
For young workers like Mr. Murray, who recalls the scarcity of growing up in the Robert Taylor Homes housing project, the apprenticeship program amounts to a chance at the American Dream.
"I want to build a new house," said Mr. Murray, who is married and has four children. "It's my goal. And I'm going to reach it."

HEADLINE: Inventors of Paper Clips and Tall Tales

BYLINE: By FRANK BRUNI 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 12

 BODY:
Capping a week that illuminated whole new dimensions to the talents and accomplishments of this city's most powerful politicians, Senator Trent Lott, the majority leader, revealed today that he was the inventor of the modern paper clip.
"During my service in the United States Congress," Mr. Lott, a Mississippi Republican, said in a written statement, "I took the initiative in creating the paper clip. Paper clips bind us together as a nation." 
 Was he for real? Not exactly, although he was doing an awfully good imitation.
Mr. Lott's deadpan announcement, printed on his official letterhead, was the latest and cleverest effort by Republicans to rib Vice President Al Gore for a statement on Tuesday on CNN in which he said he "took the initiative in creating the Internet."
Mr. Gore was referring to a legislative career in which he promoted technological advancements, but his Republican colleagues obviously thought his precise phrasing grabbed a tad too much credit.
"If the Vice President created the Internet," Representative Dick Armey, the House majority leader, said in a statement after Mr. Gore's remarks, "then I created the Interstate highway system."
Mr. Lott's claim was a bit more ingenious, because it poked fun not only at Mr. Gore but also at himself. Mr. Lott is famous for his fastidiousness.
Today's news release said: "Lott, known for his passion for order, said that paper clips are a crucial element to a well-organized office. Lott also noted that paper clips help contribute to a growing economy."
The release quoted the Senator as saying: "Paper clips are the engine of the U.S. economy. The Dow will soon break 10,000, due in part to strong growth in the paper clip industry."
And it included six sketches chronicling the evolution of Mr. Lott's sketches for the paper clip, culminating in the creation of the current design on April 1, 1973. Note the month and day.
In a telephone interview from Miami, where the Vice President was visiting a Federal "empowerment zone," a spokesman for Mr. Gore said that Mr. Lott's claim was apt.
"It's no surprise that Senator Lott and the Republicans are taking credit for an invention that has been around for centuries," the spokesman, Christopher S. Lehane, said, at least partly in jest. "After all, their policies are intended to take us back to the Dark Ages."
But once again, the Gore camp was reaching a bit too far. The paper clip, sired by a Norwegian man named Johan Vaaler, goes back only about 100 years.

HEADLINE: Oil Is Rising, but Inflation Seems to Be in Check

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER 

 BODY:
The oil price surge this year, which got another boost yesterday with a new agreement on cutting production, is beginning to sting consumers.
Gasoline pump prices began to creep up this month. Colder weather in the Northeast could add to the heating oil pinch. Higher prices for airplane fuel may make tickets more expensive quickly. The indirect ripple effects, in products, like plastics, that use oil, will take longer to bite, but will come. 
 But despite the oil price increase, economists are not predicting a new surge in inflation across the board. Rather, they are merely saying that the decline in inflation, which limited last year's increase in the Consumer Price Index to 1.6 percent, will be over if the oil price rises stick.
This means, economists said yesterday, that the rate of inflation over all, which includes energy and food prices, is likely to move up toward the rate for what economists call core inflation. That rate, which excludes energy and food, is considered by some to be a better measure of the long-term rate of price increases. Last year, the C.P.I.'s core rate rose 2.3 percent. But, the economists agree, there is no upward spiral on the horizon.
"I think we should notice but not worry," said Gail D. Fosler, the chief economist at the Conference Board. "There is really nothing in the global environment or the United States environment that suggests that this is going to spread."
Still, it remains to be seen whether consumers will get unnerved when they see reports that prices are moving up rather than holding steady or declining. Investors might also get disturbed and push the price of bonds down and interest rates higher. But there was no sign of this kind of concern in the bond market yesterday, as interest rates on Treasury securities fell and the Government's inflation-indexed bonds were virtually unchanged.
The changing outlook for inflation was reflected pointedly in two separate news events yesterday. First, the Labor Department reported that prices paid to producers fell four-tenths of 1 percent in February. Without energy and food, producer prices were unchanged. Throughout the report there were signs that the prices of many goods were still falling.
Oil ministers meeting at The Hague also announced that they had the outline of an agreement to cut oil production by two million barrels a day. That report pushed up the price of oil for delivery in April to $14.49 a barrel, its highest since October. The anticipation of some kind of new cut in output has been pushing up the price of oil steadily since mid-February, when it was $11.37 a barrel, just above a 13-year low.
There are several reasons that economists are not predicting another general price spiral. One is that the global economic growth is still sluggish at best. Even if Asia, which touched off a worldwide financial crisis in 1997 with a series of currency devaluations, is recovering, Latin America is in decline and Europe seems to be standing still or slipping.
Chase Manhattan Bank forecasts about 1.5 percent growth globally this year. Even if stronger-than-expected United States growth pulls that up to 2 percent, that will be significantly below recent years' pace, said James E. Glassman, Chase's senior United States economist.
"The main driver for all this good inflation news is that we are not growing at our potential globally," he said. The way to change his mind about the outlook for inflation, he said, is to have oil prices rising because global demand was picking up.
Another factor is that other commodity prices, from cotton to copper, are at or near their recent lows. The Commodity Research Bureau/ Bridge index of 17 commodities, which fell yesterday, is just 5 points above its 24-year low hit at the end of February.
"Until there is significant upward pressure on all commodities, we are not going to have any worrisome price impact," said Ms. Fosler of the Conference Board.
In addition, while oil prices have shot up 20 percent this year, they have risen from very low levels and are just back to where they were last summer or fall, when they were already low. The same is true for gasoline prices, which were at their lowest level, after adjustment for inflation, since at least the 1950's.
And there is the question of whether the production cuts will hold or have a significant impact. Oil producers are notorious for cheating, even after agreeing to pump less oil. After the last major effort to cut production began in March 1998, the price of oil dropped 36 percent to its low of $10.72 a barrel in December.
But while there is not a new inflation spiral in sight, the overall inflation rate will rise if the oil price increase holds.
Michael Rothman, senior energy analyst at Merrill Lynch, estimates that the price of oil could move up to $17 a barrel soon. And he said it could possibly move near $20 a barrel by the end of the year if there was a sustained reduction in production that made a meaningful dent in the current overload of oil inventories.
Cynthia Latta, principal United States economist at Standard & Poor's DRI in Lexington, Mass., ran an end-of-the-year oil price of $18 a barrel through her computer model and found the following: The DRI forecast of a 1.8 percent rise in the C.P.I., year-over-year, in 1999 inches up to 2.1 percent. And if the oil price held there, the C.P.I. would increase 2.8 percent in 2000 and 2.6 percent in 2001, before slipping back to 2.4 percent in 2002.
This is above the 1.6 percent increase for 1998. But the number is less startling when compared with the 2.3 percent increase in the C.P.I. in 1997 and the 3 percent rise in 1996. In addition, the forecasts are close to the increase in the core C.P.I., without the volatile elements of food and energy, which rose 2.3 percent in 1998, 2.4 percent in 1997 and 2.7 percent in 1996.
All this leads Ms. Latta to agree with the other economists on the recent rise in oil prices: "It is not going to have much of an impact on inflation."

January Inventories Up
 WASHINGTON, March 12 (Reuters) -- United States businesses added to their stocks of goods on hand in January, with retailers in particular building inventories in anticipation of strong shopping, the Government said today.
Total business inventories increased one-tenth of a percent to a seasonally adjusted $1.088 trillion in January, reversing a one-tenth of a percent decrease in December. But overall sales were down for the first time in five months.
The report reflected booming consumer demand as retailers recorded strong sales and inventory building. The reverse was true for both wholesalers and manufacturers, whose January sales and inventories were lower than in December.
Retailers, enjoying robust sales, increased their goods on hand in January by eight-tenths of a percent, to $336.3 billion, after a seven-tenths of a percent rise in December. Retail sales increased 1 percent, to $234.35 billion, after a 1.1 percent surge in December.
Total sales by all levels of businesses -- retail, wholesale and manufacturing -- were down in January by three-tenths of 1 percent, to $791.09 billion, after a 1 percent jump in December.
It was the first decline in total monthly business sales since a two-tenths of 1 percent fall in August last year and was the biggest monthly drop since a half a percent dip in August 1997.
Manufacturers' inventories fell in January by three-tenths of 1 percent, to $465.57 billion, after a nine-tenths of 1 percent December fall. Sales by manufacturing companies declined eight-tenths of 1 percent, to $341.46 billion, after an eight-tenths of 1 percent gain in December.

HEADLINE: Caterpillar Says Its Profits Will Be Below Expectations

BYLINE: By DAVID BARBOZA 

DATELINE: PEORIA, Ill., March 12

 BODY:
Citing a sales slowdown in Latin America and stiff competition in North America, Caterpillar Inc., the world's largest maker of construction and earthmoving equipment, warned today that its first-quarter profits would be far below expectations. The news caused the company's stock to tumble 12.2 percent, pulling down the Dow Jones industrial average.
The warning was just the latest in a series of blows to Caterpillar, which has been suffering through a gradual decline in sales and profits over the last year, largely because of the global economic crisis that began in Asia in late 1997. 
 Caterpillar shares fell $6.1875, or 12.2 percent, on the New York Stock Exchange today, to $44.6875. The stock had the biggest decline among the 30 stocks in the industrial average, which finished the day off 21.09 points, or two-tenths of 1 percent.
In a press release issued this morning, the company said it expected earnings per share to decline by as much as 50 percent from the corresponding quarter a year ago, well below the estimates of Wall Street analysts. Business is expected to strengthen in the second half of the year, the company said.
Still, analysts are projecting an earnings-per-share decline of 10 to 15 percent in 1999, and Caterpillar officials say they are comfortable with those estimates.
Caterpillar said it would temporarily idle plants here and abroad in the coming months and cut back on administrative costs and on research and development. Reductions in the work force are also being considered.
While the company's North American business is suffering from stiff competition and pricing pressure, most of its problems are related to recessionary forces in Asia and Latin America. And that has many analysts worried that the same forces could spread to the United States.
"We knew that Asia was quite depressed, and now Latin America is sinking like a stone and Europe is flattish," Robert McCarthy, an analyst at ABN Amro in Chicago, said. "This means they are very vulnerable to any slowdown in North America."
While sales of construction and earthmoving equipment remain strong in the United States, sales of agricultural and mining equipment are slumping because of weakness in those sectors. Sales of engines and solar turbines are also depressed, Caterpillar said, which could force temporary plant shutdowns in Europe and Latin America.
In 1998, Latin America accounted for about 9 percent of Caterpillar's sales. The company said its sales in Brazil were particularly bad.
"We said before that Brazil and Latin America were going to be in recession, and that's definitely the case," said Marsha Hausser, a spokeswoman for Caterpillar. "But we're anticipating that the second half is going to be better than the first."
Part of the problem, analysts say, is that Caterpillar and other companies have introduced a broad mix of new agricultural tractors, but the agricultural sector -- even in the United States -- is in a slump because of plummeting commodity prices. Those tractors are being aggressively priced, and as a result profit margins are shrinking throughout the industry, particularly at companies like the Case Corporation, which is based in Racine, Wis.
For Caterpillar, one of the companies that make up the Dow Jones industrial average, the economy in the United States has been strong enough to offset some losses in other markets. But the construction industry here has not been strong enough to bring healthy profits to a global company.
Wall Street analysts said today's announcement was not very surprising, but it did force some of them to trim back their expectations for 1999.
"This pretty well cements the fact that this will be the second down year for Caterpillar, even though North America remains strong," Mr. McCarthy of ABN Amro said.

HEADLINE: EXPANDING ALLIANCE: THE OVERVIEW;
Poland, Hungary and the Czechs Join NATO

BYLINE: By JANE PERLEZ

DATELINE: INDEPENDENCE, Mo., March 12

 BODY:
The North Atlantic Treaty Organization today embraced three former rivals -- the Czech Republic, Hungary and Poland -- formally ending the Soviet domination that began after World War II and opening a new path for the military alliance.
In a ceremony at the Truman Presidential Library tinged with the personal and the emotional, Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright watched the three foreign ministers sign the documents of accession, signed them herself, then held them aloft like victory trophies. 
 Ms. Albright, who was born in Prague and fled just after the Communist takeover in 1948, made no secret today of her joy as her homeland and the two other nations joined the alliance, after six years of trans-Atlantic diplomacy led by the Clinton Administration.
"To quote an old Central European expression, 'Hallelujah!' ' she said.
In Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic, the moment was marked by small public celebrations.
In Warsaw, as fireworks lit the sky, the Polish flag and the flag of NATO were raised side by side near the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier in Pilsudski Square. In Hungary, members' flags were raised outside the Defense Ministry. And in Prague, President Vaclav Havel said in a statement, "Never have we been part of such a broad, solid and binding security alliance, which at the same time respects in its essence the sovereignty and will of our nation."
The enlargement of NATO to 19 members, from 16, has been one of the Administration's foremost goals, one that grew out of a desire to cement the democratic gains made in the former Warsaw Pact countries after the collapse of Communism 10 years ago.
But the policy also faced critics, who argued that welcoming these countries would draw a new line across Europe and antagonize the Russians.
In a speech in the small auditorium to dignitaries from the three countries, and with the three foreign ministers flanking her, Ms. Albright countered that the alliance would do "for Europe's east what NATO has already helped to do for Europe's west: steadily and systematically, we will continue erasing -- without replacing -- the line drawn in Europe by Stalin's bloody boot."
Ms. Albright also offered a forward-looking vision for NATO, which celebrates its 50th anniversary in Washington next month, and defended possible NATO involvement in Kosovo.
In the aftermath of the cold war, she said, members must be ready to face "an aggressive regime, a rampaging faction or a terrorist group."
"And we know that if past is prologue," she continued, "we face a future in which weapons will be more destructive at longer distances than ever before." The summit meeting for the 50th anniversary, she said, will produce a program that "responds to the grave threat posed by weapons of mass destruction and their means of delivery."
Regarding Kosovo, where President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia has rejected the deployment of NATO troops, Ms. Albright insisted the organization is the best tool to enforce a peace settlement.
"We must be clear in explaining that a settlement without NATO-led enforcement is not acceptable," she said, "because only NATO has the credibility and capability to make it work. And we must be resolute in spelling out the consequences of intransigence," referring to the threat of air strikes against Mr. Milosevic if he does not agree to the deployment.
But in many ways, today belonged to the Czech Republic, Hungary and Poland, who have had to cut the size of their Soviet-style armies, organize civilian control of the military and agree to buy NATO-compatible equipment in the coming years.
It was the spiritual homecoming to the West that all three foreign ministers stressed today.
"Poland forever returns where she has always belonged: the free world," said Bronislaw Geremek, the Polish Foreign Minister, who was a dissident during the Communist era.
Mr. Geremek said he had brought some appropriate mementoes to the Truman library, including a campaign poster from 1989, when the Solidarity labor movement won against the Communists. The poster showed a picture of Gary Cooper from the film "High Noon."
"It helped us to win," Mr. Geremek said. "For the people of Poland, high noon comes today."
The Czech Foreign Minister, Jan Kavan, who lived in London from 1968, when Soviet troops invaded Czechoslovakia, until 1989, said he had remained buoyant during his work as an emigre by believing that Communism would eventually fall. But he never dreamed, he said, that his country would join NATO.
"Accession to NATO is a guarantee that we will never again become powerless victims of any foreign aggression," he said.
The Hungarian Foreign Minister, Janos Martonyi, who saw the 1956 uprising as a 13-year-old, said Hungary is returning "to her natural habitat."
"It has been our manifest destiny to rejoin those with whom we share the same values, interests and goals," he said.
But Mr. Martonyi also went out of his way to emphasize that Hungary understands that membership carries obligations as well as privileges. "We shall prove that new members can indeed add to the weight of the alliance," he said.
The location for today's ceremony in America's heartland was chosen by Ms. Albright.
She made the unusual decision on a site outside Washington because she wanted the ceremony to resonate with the memories of President Truman, under whom NATO was founded. On April 4, 1949, Secretary of State Dean Acheson signed the Washington Treaty, which established the alliance. Acheson is Ms. Albright's favorite predecessor, her aides said.
Formed to face the threat of the Soviet Union under Stalin, NATO calls for the collective defense of its members. At first there were 12; Greece and Turkey joined in 1952, West Germany in 1955 and Spain in 1982. But never before has the group reached out to former enemies.
The Administration embarked on the expansion in 1993 after Mr. Clinton met in Washington with President Havel and Lech Walesa, then President of Poland. Those conversations are remembered by Mr. Clinton's foreign policy advisers because they took place after the opening of the Holocaust Museum and because they involved two very different leaders who brought the same message: that NATO should be the mechanism to secure the democratic progress in their countries, and at the same time deter Russia from any more imperial designs.
The American Ambassador to Poland, Daniel Fried, who was then on the National Security Council, said today that he remembered being asked to help "turn this pious wish into a policy."
In July 1997, at a summit meeting in Madrid, the alliance announced it would accept Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic. Romania and Slovenia, which had tried hard to meet the standards, were turned away for the time being.
One problem was how to deal with the Russians, who inched from outright hostility to acceptance of the inevitable. In early 1997, President Boris N. Yeltsin told President Clinton he could live with NATO expansion. But in order to accommodate the Russians, the group set up a consultative body that formalized relations between Moscow and the alliance.
Poland has been sensitive to Russia's reactions, and Mr. Geremek has gone out of his way to reassure Moscow. "We want our membership of NATO to serve as a catalyst for Polish-Russian cooperation," he said last year.
Even so, on the plane bringing the foreign ministers here today, when they were asked whether they could ever foresee Russia as a member of NATO, there was a long pause. Then Mr. Martonyi replied, "Silence is your answer."

To the Editor:
In reviewing Peter G. Peterson's "Gray Dawn" (Feb. 14), David Kusnet is much too kind, largely because economists of virtually all persuasions share some basic fallacies. Principal among these is that Government deficit spending damages the economy and must be eliminated, no matter what public needs have to be thrown aside. Presumably, the Social Security system cannot deal with demographic trends without dangerous deficit spending. 
 The historical record is largely ignored. Multiyear budget surpluses have always led to major depressions, a 6-for-6 batting average since 1819. The national debt was cut 36 percent in the 1920's, for example, and the Great Depression followed. Only the deficits of World War II ended the misery, and the 1946 national debt was 127 percent of gross domestic product. Today's debt is less than half that size, relative to the economy, and is probably too small. A country that could afford that war and that debt can afford Social Security. Deficit spending always helps the economy; it never hurts it.
The past half-century is the first relatively stable economic period in our history, and also a period of almost constant deficits. Deficit cuts and a balanced budget are slowing our economy and damaging the global economy, as they always have.

HEADLINE: FRUGAL TRAVELER;
An Orlando Weekend Of Blooms, Birds and Tiffany

BYLINE: By SARAH FERRELL; SARAH FERRELL is the associate editor of The Sophisticated Traveler of The New York Times Magazine.

 BODY:
THE snow and sleet and ice that we were hoping to escape delayed our departure from New York for several hours, but Tom and I couldn't complain. Unlike many other flights, ours made it to Florida that Thursday.
Orlando had much to recommend it as a quick winter getaway: warm weather, low air fare, cheap rental cars. I had telephoned Budget and discovered, to my delight, that the cheapest available rental vehicle, at a promotional rate of $19.99 a day, was a Ford Ranger pickup -- spanking new, painted metallic cinnabar, with a locking cover for the truck bed. In the cab, two comfortable bucket seats provided an overview of the heavy rush-hour traffic. 
 Since we intended to avoid downtown Orlando and all things Disney, I had negotiated a $71.10 room at a Fairfield Inn, a Marriott economy chain, in the suburb of Winter Park. Our room, No. 137, was nicely, if generically, furnished; the dressing area and sink were at the back of the bedroom, while the tub-shower combination and toilet had a little room of their own. A fair-sized, lighted swimming pool lay just outside the door.
By the time we checked in, it was dark and we were hungry. The path of least resistance led directly across the highway to a Denny's, where we checked the menu for regional specialties and came up with the chicken-fried steak dinner. Two big pieces of meat apiece, carrots and real mashed potatoes with peppery country gravy were $5.09; endlessly refillable iced tea, $1.28. We went back to our room to count our cholesterol.
We awoke to bright sunlight and the song of a cardinal. Breakfast, which came with the room, offered a choice of teas, coffee, cereals, toast, fresh fruit and individually wrapped breakfast breads -- very odd, when the bread in question is a bagel. And orange juice, which, like tea and coffee, was always available in the lobby. As we ate, we watched televised scenes of frozen crowds waving to the cameras in Rockefeller Center and tried not to giggle.
The town of Winter Park is, well, pretty cute. A street of mostly two-story stucco buildings containing boutiques and galleries and cafes parallels the park that gives the street its name, Park Avenue. The park itself is called Central Park, and is charmingly green, with old live oaks and tiny squirrels, a decorative fountain and an Amtrak station -- the railroad came through in 1882, shortly before the city was founded. The town is surrounded by lakes, and is anchored by Rollins College, a small, private liberal-arts college founded in 1885.
Admission to the Charles Hosmer Morse Museum of American Art, at the northern end of the brief commercial district, is usually $3, but it was temporarily free because the galleries were being reconstructed to house the chapel that Louis Comfort Tiffany designed for the 1893 Chicago world's fair. If only a part of the collection of Tiffany glass and art pottery and jewelry were on display, we didn't mind. The collection was assembled by Jeannette McKean and her husband, Hugh F. McKean, a former fellow at the Tiffany Foundation who was also a president of Rollins. (Mr. Morse, an early settler, was her grandfather.) The glowing favrile glass vases and dragonfly and spider-web lamps are, of course, glorious, but the windows are a wonder, especially the three-panel "Magnolia" window that was made for the Tiffany mansion on East 72d Street in New York. (You can touch an exhibit of the types of glass that Tiffany developed for his work, including the semi-opaque "draped" glass used to create the magnolias.) After several passes through the galleries, we were giddy with color.
We had lunch at a modest vegetarian establishment, the Powerhouse Cafe, just off the avenue. I had vegetarian grape leaves, Tom a sandwich of many kinds of veggies in pita bread. We drank smoothies: Mine was the fairly straightfoward berry-cherry (174 calories); Tom's was 255 calories worth of cosmic crunch -- papaya juice, strawberries, bananas, dates, granola and honey. The drinks came in pretty tropical pastel shades of coral and lilac. The bill was less than $15.
We had decided to take the Scenic Boat Tour through three of Winter Park's lakes, but later in the afternoon, which left us with some time to kill. None of our guidebooks mentioned Mead Botanical Garden, but it was on one of our maps, and nearby. It turned out to be less of an actual garden than a piece of untouched semiswamp, through which a boardwalk snaked its way. We wandered past sawgrass and wax myrtle, listening to the palmettos clatter in the wind and enjoying the boggy smell. In the hour or so we spent there, we saw only one other person, a young man seated in silent contemplation at the edge of a stream. But there was a pileated wookpecker, and monarchs cavorting in the designated butterfly garden. We felt as if we had discovered a secret.
The Scenic Boat Tours leave from the foot of Morse Avenue on Lake Osceola. The tour, which costs $7, takes a little over an hour, traversing Lakes Osceola, Virginia and Maitland, which are connected by narrow, shady canals. The boat, which looks like a big sardine tin on three pontoons, seats 18 on open benches.
We passed the backs of grand houses and boathouses in every conceivable style, and admired a landscape of cypress knees, live oaks, philodendrons and Spanish moss. The guide-narrator gave us bad jokes and good information, particularly about the fauna. We did not see the alligators or barred owls that occasionally appear, but we did see cormorants, and herons blue and white and great and small, and egrets and a whole tree full of anhingas, those strange denizens of the Everglades also know as snake birds because they hunt with only their heads and long, serpentish necks sticking out of the water.
Back on Park, we window-shopped art glass and jewelry and European toys for a bit, then settled into the Park Avenue Grill for dinner. At the bar, Tom, the designated driver, had a virgin mary, and I had a gimlet. In a fit of false economy, since it was still happy hour, with $1 off every drink, I had two. The bill, for drinks and dinner in the skylighted dining room, came to less than $ 40: Tom had a huge chunk of prime rib and I had a full dozen giant coconut-fried prawns -- more than I could eat.
We spent the next day, a Saturday, at the Kennedy Space Center, a little more than an hour's drive from Orlando. Fast-food urban sprawl gave way to vicious-looking palmetto scrub and then, as we approached the center itself, to a truly surreal skyline. There, gleaming against a huge blue sky, were the seven great boosters that stand like monoliths in the outdoor Rocket Garden display. For the first of several times, our jaws dropped.
Entrance to the Space Center is free, but you have to take a bus through restricted areas to get to the really good stuff. We decided that the best value for us was the Crew Pass ($19), which would get us on the bus and allow us to see one of three IMAX movies. Since I had a book of coupons (widely available) that gave us $2 off each pass, we paid $17 each.
The bus makes three stops: at the LC 39 observation gantry, at the International Space Station Center and at the Apollo-Saturn V Center. Since we had only a day, we chose to devote ourselves to the last. But the center is also a nature preserve, filled with the usual (by now) egrets and herons. From the bus, we also spotted a couple of alligators snoozing beside a drainage ditch. Then suddenly, the driver pointed out a bald eagle seated on a cement stanchion. Major jaw-drop. A few yards farther on, an enormous conical eagles' nest hung in a tree. Golly.
You enter the Apollo-Saturn V Center through a gigantic Flash Gordonish time lock. After some orientation movies, you pass through a big metal door and into the firing room, where blinking lights and audio clips recreate the Apollo 8 launching. Anyone old enough to remember the moon landing is apt to be awe-struck; we were. In the next room, hanging horizontally, is a Saturn V booster; we'd always known they were big, but its length still came as a surprise. The same gallery has a lot of interactive exhibits and toys and (what had become of great interest to us) a cafeteria. We took our hot dogs, fries and lemonades ($10.90 total) out onto a broad terrace, and watched turkey buzzards circle over yet another lake.
Back at the Visitor Complex, we chose the IMAX movie "The Dream Is Alive," with some truly stomach-churning footage of a landing taken from the nose of a shuttle. We poked around the gift shop and the Rocket Garden and had a few snacks until it was suddenly time to leave.
Our route to Winter Park took us along the Beeline Expressway, the last few miles of which was lined with huge billboards, many in 3-D, for the big-budget attractions that we were ignoring. Traffic was heavy, and we moved slowly. This stretch, as Tom observed, must be hell if you have children in the car.
On an earlier stroll along Park Avenue, we had caught a glimpse of what appeared to be Tiffany glass in La Venezia Cafe. And so it was, three big panels on loan from the Morse Museum. Since the cocktail hour had arrived, we settled down at the bar to admire the shining window that, appropriately, showed grapes on a trellis, and ordered a couple of what turned out to be expensive drinks. My gimlet was $6.50, and the designated driver's virgin mary was a shocking $5.95, more than a whole chicken-fried steak dinner. But it was probably worth it, since it came with a slab of carrot, a celery stalk, a large stuffed olive, an onion, lemon and lime slices and a giant shrimp. "When we garnish, we garnish," the young woman behind the bar said.
Dinner, served on a patio with louvers opening onto the street, was of necessity something of an anticlimax, although my lamb with couscous was fine. (Tom's paella, made with orzo instead of rice, was less successful.) Still, at $32 for two, not counting drinks, it wasn't a bad buy. We wished we had left room for dessert, since the pastry selection looked superb; or perhaps we should have just stopped in for coffee and cake, as others seemed to be doing.
We had most of a day on Sunday, since we did not have to return the Ranger until 5 P.M. If I had been disappointed in anything, it was that we had not seen many flowers, a situation that we decided to remedy by a visit to the Harry P. Leu Gardens, overlooking Lake Rowena (Lake Ivanhoe is just up the road) in Orlando proper. Admission to the gardens is $4, but that day it was free, since it was the annual Camellia Weekend. Events included a camellia ikebana workshop and a juried exhibit of camellia blossoms -- several hundred, singly or in groups, in every possible color and shape.
By official count, the nearly 50 acres of gardens, donated to the City of Orlando by Harry P. Leu, a local businessman, and his wife, Mary Jane, contains some 2,200 camellias, planted between 1936 and the early 1960's. Their peak blooming period is from mid-January to mid-March, and most of them have grown into substantial trees. Many of them, in full bloom, were veiled in Spanish moss, as mysterious and magical as anything in the Brothers Grimm. But camellias are only part, although a large one, of the gardens. There are, among other things, an orchid house, a rose garden, a butterfly garden and an enchanting, cool forest of bamboo, palms and cycads, as well as an overlook on the lake, where one can spy on herons.
We found lunch at the Red Rose Cafe, which had been set up exclusively for the camellia festival to serve sort of church-bazaar food at church-bazaar prices. A generous ham-and-brie sandwich was $3, lemonade $1, a homemade lemon-coconut square $1. We ate on a terrace under a giant live oak, and watched cloud reflections on the lake. Refreshed and rejoicing in our good luck, we took another leisurely tour of the gardens, then headed for the airport. A few drops of rain were falling.
Back in New York, braving the icy winds, we still felt warm.
 
Bottom line: variations from a theme park
Our three-night escape to Florida cost us about $950, including farewell drinks at the Orlando airport, where the designated driver allowed himself a martini.
Our New York-Orlando fares on Delta were $208 each. The pickup rental came to just under $100, with tax and gasoline; tolls were $3.50.
Three nights at the Fairfield Inn, 951 Wymore Road, Winter Park, telephone and fax (407) 539-1955, were $236.76, with tax and breakfast. Other meals, including snacks and drinks, were about $150.
By fluke, we avoided $14 in admission fees; the Winter Park boat tour and Crew Pass at the Kennedy Space Center cost a total of $48.
 
Where to Eat
The Powerhouse Cafe, 111 East Lyman Avenue, Winter Park, (407) 645-3616, is open from 10 A.M. to 7 P.M., Monday through Friday; from 11 A.M. to 5 P.M. on Saturday, and closed Sunday. Healthy soups ($2 to $2.75), salads ($3.50 to $5) and sandwiches ($2.50 to $4.50), as well as vegetarian Middle Eastern specialties and smoothies ($2.75).
Both Park Avenue Grill, 358 Park Avenue North, Winter Park, (407) 647-4556, and La Venezia Cafe, 142 Park Avenue South, Winter Park, (407) 647-7557, are open daily for lunch and dinner. At either, a meal for two with drinks should be about $40 to $50.
Fast food and snacks are available at the Kennedy Space Center. Specialties include Apollo beer and Space Dots, "the ice cream of the future" ($2.75 for more than you'll probably want to eat). We had our modest lunch ($10.90) on the terrace of the Moon Rock Cafe in the Apollo-Saturn V Center.

HEADLINE: PRACTICAL TRAVELER;
How Safe Is the Hotel Safe?

BYLINE: By BETSY WADE 

 BODY:
LAST Sept. 1, Dr. Odi Matityahu and his wife, Liat, arrived in St. Thomas, the Virgin Islands, to celebrate her birthday. They checked into the Renaissance Grand Beach Resort about 3 P.M. Dr. Matityahu said that the hotel staff asked if they needed a safe for their valuables, and they were given the key to a wall safe in their room. They stored their valuables, including passports and jewelry, and went swimming. When they returned at 5:20, the room safe had been removed with a beer-can opener, which was left behind. The room door had not been forced, they said.
This situation, and a different problem that befell two other hotel guests in Miami, illuminate aspects of hotel liability that may come as unwelcome news to travelers. 
 Dr. Matityahu said that he and his wife got a hotel and a police report about the theft and that the resort manager said there was nothing to worry about because the insurance company would take care of them. After the couple returned home to Plano, Tex., Dr. Matityahu said, an insurance adjuster called to say the couple would be compensated for their losses -- up to a total of $200. Since Dr. Matityahu's list includes more than $33,000 in jewelry, he refused to accept.
The $200 offer was not a random one. It is the limit of "innkeeper liability" in the Virgin Islands' legal code when guests entrust their valuables to the hotel for safekeeping and the valuables are lost through "theft, damage, destruction or otherwise." It is not that a hotel cannot pay more, but $200 is the most it is obliged to pay.
If valuables are not entrusted to the hotel, the guest is entitled to no compensation in the event of a loss.
Since the event, Dr. Matityahu said, he has received unsatisfactory and "rude" responses from the hotel and some of its officers. He turned the matter over to a lawyer at home and a suit was filed for damages of $47,565, including losses caused by Dr. Matityahu's absence from his chiropractic practice, airline tickets, new passports and a replacement for his green card (he is an Israeli national).
 
Who Owns What?
 The issue of whom to sue, in the age of real estate investment trusts, franchising and hotel management companies, is difficult. George B. Flint, the Matityahus' lawyer, filed the suit in Texas against Marriott, which owns the Renaissance Group.
The Dallas lawyer representing Marriott in this case, Ellen Presby of Mills, Presby & Associates, said "they sued the wrong company" and that despite the name, the real owner of the hotel is Hotel Property Investment Inc., whose address she did not know. Mr. Flint has asked for this.
The jewelry is carried on the family insurance policy, and Dr. Matit yahu is filing a claim. But he says his premiums will rise sharply.
Mr. Flint says that the case will hinge on negligence. "That was not a safe as 'safe' is understood in Texas law," he said in an interview. "I think if you asked 12 members of a jury if something you could remove with a can opener is a safe, the vote would be 12-0 against it."
The matter of limiting innkeepers' liability goes far back in law. A cap on what an innkeeper must pay if travelers lose their belongings came about to protect those who provided shelter to people on the road -- a desirable situation in the view of public policy -- from being put out of business by visitors who sued after being robbed on the premises.
In the United States, every state and territory has a law limiting this liability, and each state requires that notices of this be posted in a particular way. No Federal law is involved.
Many of these limits were set in the last century, and inflation has made them out of date. In the last five years, some legislatures have been pushed by consumers into raising the limits.
John Hyland, a lawyer at Sherry & O'Neill in New York, which specializes in hotel law, gave some figures for the limits in states popular with tourists: New Jersey, $5,000; New York, $1,500; Florida, $1,000; California, $1,000; Nevada, $750, and Illinois, $500.
John Sherry Jr., emeritus professor of law at the Cornell School of Hotel Administration, whose father was an original partner of Sherry & O'Neill, is more pragmatist than litigator. "If you have heirloom jewelry," he said, "don't take it to a hotel, even for a wedding. The best hotels attract the best confidence artists, and they will get to you some way. You might as well wear good-quality paste."
 
A Miami Robbery
Another issue of hotel liability appears in the case of Jim and Judith Whalen of Seal Beach, Calif., who describe themselves as a senior couple. On Nov. 19, on a business trip to Miami, they returned to the hotel, the Doubletree at Coconut Grove, at 8 P.M. When they were 50 feet from the hotel entrance, they said, they and a couple leaving the hotel with two young children were set upon by four youths, knocked down and robbed.
"Despite the proximity to the hotel entrance," Mrs. Whalen wrote, "hotel security did not respond to our collective screams."
She said that research by friends who were members of the Florida bar showed that Florida law provided no shield to forbid lawsuits against good Samaritans who made mistakes in pursuit of their good intentions. This resulted in security officers' normally refusing to go outside a hotel's entrance and driveway to help guests in difficulty.
It has a wrong-way sound to it, but a spokesman for the hotel industry in Florida says hotels do not want their employees going into the street to help people because of this liability issue. The spokesman, Thomas A. Waits, president of the Florida Hotel and Motel Association, said: "Hotels have gone the extra mile, and they can be held liable for these actions. Business does not win in court."
He added that with tort reform, good Samaritans would be supported by law.
Tort reform, a sticky political issue everywhere, is opposed by law groups because it makes it tougher for consumers to sue businesses. The Florida Legislature approved tort reform last year, but it was vetoed by Gov. Lawton Chiles, a Democrat. The new Governor, Jeb Bush, a Republican, has pledged himself to tort reform.
Mrs. Whalen said that when she talked to clerks in the hotel afterward, she was told the area was unsafe at night. Although she had earlier received directions from the hotel desk, that does not create liability. Repeated calls to Doubletree management yielded no response.
Prof. Robert M. Jarvis, an author of "Travel Law, Cases and Materials" (Carolina Academic Press), said that hotels had won cases in situations where concierges gave directions to places that proved unsafe. "Even though the hotel sets the trip in motion," said Professor Jarvis, who teaches at Nova Southeastern University in Fort Lauderdale, "if it happens outside the perimeter, the hotel is not liable."
Both stories remind travelers that although one's home may be one's castle, one's hotel is not one's home. Costly jewelry should be insured and not taken to hotels, and guests who suspect that an area may be of doubtful safety should call for a cab.

HEADLINE: FILM;
Nihilsm Gets a Butcher's Face, France a Jolt of Realism

BYLINE: By ALAN RIDING 

DATELINE: PARIS

 BODY:
AFTER seeing "I Stand Alone," after meeting its 35-year-old director, Gaspar Noe, one couldn't help but ask: How could a pleasant young man with a positive view of life make a film as dark and desperate as this one?
Well, Mr. Noe might of course have confessed that he was a secret nihilist, that "I Stand Alone" ("Seul Contre Tous") was a public form of psychotherapy. Reassuringly, his answer was more straightforward. 
 "I can make a film like this because I feel at ease with myself," he said. "I was raised in a comfortable household with adoring parents who gave me nothing but love, and this allows me to make a film about depression that in the end is very combative."
An Argentine-born Frenchman, Mr. Noe was talking in a cafe beside one of the two Paris theaters where his movie is playing. On Wednesday it opens in New York for a two-week run at the Film Forum. "I Stand Alone" is his first feature film, but in fact it picks up where his award-winning 1991 short, "Carne," left off in its portrayal of an ill-starred Paris butcher of horse meat, again played by the burly Philippe Nahon. The new film stands on its own, but to explain why its central character is about to move still closer to the edge, Mr. Noe opens with a series of stills, accompanied by the butcher's raspy voiceover, recapitulating the story so far:
The butcher has achieved his dream of opening his own shop when he meets a factory worker who becomes pregnant and then abandons him, leaving their mute daughter for him to raise. When the girl reaches puberty, she is frightened by her first menstruation and rushes to her father's shop. Seeing blood on her dress and imagining she has been raped, he stabs an innocent passer-by. After serving time in jail, with his daughter now institutionalized, he finds work as a barman and promptly seduces the owner's wife. Then, when she becomes pregnant, they decide to start a new life in Lille.
"I Stand Alone" finds the butcher living in the crammed apartment of his mistress's mother, growing ever more depressed as he struggles to find work. "You have to smile to be a butcher," he is told when he applies for a job in the meat section of a Lille supermarket. He cannot and is ordered to leave. At home, the walls close in on him as his mistress baits him for watching television. One night he explodes in anger, attacking her and pummeling her swollen stomach.He grabs his pistol and hitchhikes to Paris, never looking back.
He still imagines that hope is somewhere to be found. He checks into the very hotel room where his daughter was conceived and again looks for work without success. He tries to borrow money from old friends, but they, too, are down at heel or simply tightfisted. As his anger mounts, he is freshly humiliated: he gets into an argument in a bar and is forced to leave by a shotgun-waving owner. When a gay meat supplier turns him down for yet another job because of his jail record, he swears revenge. He has three bullets in his pistol and he plans to use them.
Recounted in this way (without revealing its ending), the story seems to be that of a middle-aged man driven to despair by unemployment, rejection and lack of love. What gives the film its extraordinary intensity, though, is the stream-of-consciousness voice-over that records the butcher's descent into hate for the world and disgust with himself.
"You are always alone, alone when you're born, alone when you die, alone, always alone," the butcher's mind tells him at one point. "The older you get, the lonelier you are, alone with a few memories that life steadily destroys. Life is like a tunnel. Everyone has his little tunnel. But at the end of the tunnel, there is no light. There is nothing."
Describing the movie as "devastating" after it was shown at last fall's New York Film Festival, Stephen Holden wrote in The New York Times that " 'I Stand Alone' probes as relentlessly into the psychology of nihilism as any movie has ever attempted."
Mr. Noe reinforces this message in the way he has shot and cut the film (he was the film's cameraman as well as its screenwriter, director, producer and co-editor), using close-up images of violence and hard-core pornography followed by sudden camera movements accompanied by amplified gunshots that heighten the tension. Interspersed, he has one-word tabloid headlines, like "Morality" and "Justice," as well as a "Warning" -- giving audiences time to leave the theater -- before the film's denouement.
Mr. Nahon's performance has deservedly won praise, not least because Mr. Noe's endless difficulties in raising money for the movie meant that the 30 days of filming were spread over almost three years. For "Carne," the actor learned how to handle and cut meat; for "I Stand Alone," it was more a question of entering into a state of mind. But he said he was unfazed by the interruptions.
"Gaspar would call up and say, 'We're shooting tomorrow because I have found money for some film stock,' " said Mr. Nahon, who is 60. "We'd meet and work out if we were shooting before or after the last scene we did. He'd say, 'Action!' and I was inside the character. It wasn't difficult. You see people like that every day everywhere. Homeless people. At 50, no one can find a job. If you've spent a few days in jail, it's worse. You're finished."
Although "I Stand Alone" is essentially a psychological study, not political commentary, some French critics have seen it as an indictment of contemporary France and, indirectly, of a French movie industry that until recently has been dominated by comedies, historical costume dramas and intimate love stories.
"The important thing is not that France at the end of the 20th century can be as sordid, ugly and pitiless as that," Le Monde's film critic, Jean-Michel Frodon, wrote of Mr. Noe's movie. "It can be. But since movies tend all too often to forget this, one that points this out is to be welcomed."
That this film was ever made is itself surprising. Neo-realism may be making a comeback here, as witnessed by Mathieu Kassovitz's "Hate," Bruno Dumont's "Life of Jesus," Erick Zonca's "Dreamlife of Angels" and Bertrand Tavernier's still-unreleased "Life Begins Today," but Mr. Noe's screenplay proved too realistic to win the backing of any French television company. And since this is the first step toward making a film here, he was on his own.
It did not help that Mr. Noe was not part of the Paris movie world. He attended a Paris film school, L'Ecole Lumiere, but he said that until he made "Carne" he was more interested in amusing himself than in working. And it was thanks to "Carne" that he eventually won support to make another 40-minute movie from the short-films division of the pay-TV channel, Canal Plus. Even then, it was almost two years before the French designer, Agnes B., provided him with the funds to make a feature-length film.
"The television people said to me, 'Why don't you come with a real project, a real police thriller, with real producers, real actors?' " Mr. Noe recalled. "The people who read screenplays are employees worried about losing their jobs if they approve something too explosive. They prefer to give money to an established director even if he makes a flop. Anyway, I worked once or twice as an assistant director on big productions and they're not for me. They resemble the Normandy landings more than a work of art. I like to work with a small team, without makeup, with little decor, where you can improvise, you can invent scenes on location."
Perhaps inevitably, "I Stand Alone" has been compared with Martin Scorsese's "Taxi Driver," but Mr. Noe also speaks admiringly of numerous other directors, among them Luis Bunuel, Elia Kazan, Sam Peckinpah, Roberto Rosselini, Vittorio de Sica and Pier Paolo Pasolini. And for his next film, he said, he would like to follow in the footsteps of Nagisa Oshima's erotic 1976 classic, "In the Realm of the Senses."
"I would like to make a film that shows people making love without it being pornographic, like 'In the Realm of the Senses,' but perhaps less morbid," he said. "I'd like to show a love story where people make love from time to time, but where the camera does not then turn to the fireplace. You can show a lot about people's psychology in the way they make love."
So, the young director was asked, does he like to shock?
"My film does not set out to shock," he said. "I think that in English the word 'shock' is more negative than in French. In French, it means more 'to disturb.' I don't think you should remove things that stir the emotions. If something disturbing leads somewhere else, why not? You know, perhaps strangely, no one has said that the violence in 'I Stand Alone' is gratuitous violence. All I have done is filter out the positive side of life. I have left the butcher with nothing more than the negative power of his existence."

HEADLINE: Q & A/Dr. Richard L. Schwab;
What It Takes to Produce Good Teachers

BYLINE: By NANCY POLK 

 BODY:
THE dean of the School of Education at the University of Connecticut, Dr. Richard L. Schwab, is a happy man. Recently a philanthropist and alumnus, Raymond Neag, donated $21 million to the school. Dr. Schwab has lots of plans for that money: scholarships and graduate assistantships, endowed chairs, outreach activities and professional development activities were among the areas he mentioned.
Dr. Schwab said his goal is to make the Neag School of Education, as it will be known, "one of the top 10 schools of education in five years." 
 Recently Dr. Schwab met to discuss his observations on education. Following are some excerpts from that conversation.
Q. Why do you require your students to work in cities and rural areas, and with special education students, if they want to teach in the suburbs?
A. We require the urban experience because urban areas reflect now what population trends will be. We're increasingly becoming more diverse. Our students need to know what all students are like, not just suburban students.
If students are going to be secondary school teachers we make them go into an elementary classroom, just so they understand -- before they get too set in their ways -- what it is that they're receiving. We might put elementary education students in a high school so they know what happens to their students after they leave.
Every one of our students has an experience with special education students, not just those preparing for special education, because they need to understand the learning needs of all children. In their junior year they have field experience, fall and spring. In their senior year they have field experience in the fall, followed by student teaching.
Q. Have you been able to diversify your student body and faculty?
A. My goal is to have all our programs, whether it is in exercise science, educational leadership or teaching, reflect the realities of today's society. We have to be prepared to work with all children, all adults, no matter what their socio-economic, ethnic or racial background.
We need to prepare more teachers from underrepresented populations so kids can see role models like themselves. Last year we went from 10 percent to 17 percent minority enrollment in our teacher education program without sacrificing one bit in the G.P.A. or requirements phase.
If you're going to build a good team you have to be like Coaches Calhoun and Geno Auriemma. You have to go out and actively recruit. It's not "build it and wait for them to come." It's "build it and make sure people know about it."
I'm working very hard to diversify our faculty in all departments. For example, I'm doing a joint search with the Puerto Rican and Latino Studies Institute.
Q. Schools of Education have come under fire as part of the general dissatisfaction with American education. How do you perceive education schools in general?
A. Just like schools of business and schools of law, there are some very good ones and some very weak ones. We have not done a good job of policing the weaker programs. A broad stroke is painted with all schools of education based on peoples' experience with many of the weak ones.
Q. How difficult is it to get into the School of Education?
A. We are highly selective. The average S.A.T. score of teacher education applicants is 1150. We don't admit them until their junior year. The G.P.A. in a subject area major is about a 3.3. Our elementary education candidates have to have a content major in English, science, history or math.
The first criteria of a good program is to get very bright talented students into it. Second, make sure they have a strong content preparation, that they know something before we expect them to teach. Third, be very selective not only in content preparation but in interpersonal skills. You need both. It's not good enough to like kids to be a good teacher. You have to love to learn. The key to being a good teacher is, do you have a love of learning?
We interview our students, we look at their grades, what experiences they've had with kids. At the end of their sophomore year they apply. In some of our programs we have three applicants and one gets in. We're almost as selective as some law schools.
Q. How many students do you have?
A. We admit 130 students each year for a total of 400 in our five-year teacher education program. It's undergraduate and graduate. It's an integrated bachelor's/master's program.
Q. Do your students work in local schools?
A. All of our methods courses are anchored in schools. We've developed relationships with local partner schools, known as professional development schools. We engage in a process called simultaneous renewal. They work with us to prepare our future teachers. And we work with them to improve practice. Our partner schools are Hartford, East Hartford, Mansfield, Ashford, Windham, Tolland, Glastonbury and E.O. Smith.
Also important in the integrated bachelor's/master's program is that our students are there in their junior and senior years and then they return to do a yearlong master's internship in one of the professional development schools. The internship is defined by the school. They work a 20-hour-a-week internship that might be setting up a technology lab or starting a tutorial program. They are not working as classroom teachers.
The district gets these very bright, talented students who tackle very significant projects for the schools. Our students write up the results of what they've done in their research. We're developing teachers who are reflective practitioners, who look at what they do, what they write, what they think, and what they test. They evaluate with their cooperating teachers and their professors.
Q. How are you changing the curriculum?
A. First we identified centers of excellence. We will be building upon those programs for gifted and talented students, teacher education, administrative preparation. We are developing an interdisciplinary early childhood program for children from birth to 5.
We're phasing out programs in sports psychology at the bachelor's, master's and Ph.D. level. We're getting rid of the Sports and Society bachelor's degree that we have. We're going to phase out our counseling psychology program and look to see if there might not be other places at the university that might be able to do it better than we can. The faculty decided that the amount of resources that it would take to make it excellent could be found somewhere else at UConn.
What we're doing instead is enhancing our program in sports management, which has much broader implications. We're also going to focus on health and wellness across the life span in that department.
Q. One problem that school teachers and administrators site as serious is the lack of parental involvement? Do you agree?
A. Parents and guardians play a key role. They should send their kids to school with breakfast, a good night's sleep. They should read to kids at home. They should shut off the TV for part of the evening and be sure that kids are doing their homework. They should take an active interest in their children's work.
Q. Do you see public schools adding hours to the day and days to the school year?
A. It's inevitable. The amount of information that we need kids to process is way beyond what they can process in 180 days from 8 to 2.
I think we have to make the best use of the school year we have now. We also have to think conceptually about restructuring the school year. It's based on the old agricultural model. The reality is in Connecticut there are very few kids who have to get in the crops. In some kids' cases, especially with children at risk, that gap of time over the summer will take a month to catch up.
It's not necessary to have everyone take vacation that one week in February. If the year was spread out more like the adult work year, we could take advantage of that. The gross reality is that some kids are left alone on the street. I contend that kids get into trouble when there is too little to do, not when there is too much to do.
Connecticut wants progress without change and inevitably if we want to improve the system we have to look at some changes.

HEADLINE: Commercial Property /New Jersey;
A 45-Acre Renewal for a Rundown Section of Lodi

BYLINE: By RACHELLE GARBARINE 

 BODY:
FROM an empty site at Main Street and Union Avenue here the view northward is of a tattered landscape. Rundown factories, many vacant, press hard against the west side of Main Street while a cluster of houses and small businesses line the east side. Salvage yards, an apartment complex and a mobile-home park dot the area's northwestern fringe.
The legacy of this Bergen County borough's industrial past is most evident in this neighborhood. The area, long thick with factories, was the site of the the 1994 explosion at the Napp Technologies pharmaceutical plant, which killed five workers and injured 41 others. 
 The neighborhood, as the sign at the planned renewal site says, will be the "New Main Street," where the $150 million Lodi Towne Center -- up to 600,000 square feet of stores, offices and entertainment uses, including a 14- to 20-screen movie theater -- will rise on 45 acres. Much of the property, which is bisected by the Saddle River, is polluted.
The borough, the redevelopment agent for the project, last year designated Crown Properties of Jersey City as the redeveloper. The project, designed as a throwback to the Main Streets of long ago, where people came to gather and shop, will rise parcel by parcel over the next five years.
"We saw through the mess to the underlying demographics that would support what we envision," said Warren Waters, a partner with Douglas Kanter at Crown Properties. Mr. Waters said a study done for the borough shows that 550,000 people with an average household income of $47,000 live within a five-mile radius of the site, where 34,000 cars pass each day.
The first five buildings, with a total of 118,000 square feet, will rise at the corner of Main Street and Union Avenue. In May, construction of two buildings will begin on an 8-acre site on the west side of Main Street -- the first structure for a 13,000-square-foot bank headquarters,to be followed in December by a 67,000-square-foot Edwards Super Food market. Across Main Street on a four-acre site, work will begin this fall on a 14,000-square-foot drugstore, a 4,000-square-foot fast food outlet and a 20,000-square-foot building for small users.
The plan, shaped over the last eight years and approved by residents in a referendum in 1994, reflects several characteristics of contemporary urban redevelopment. One is the recycling of industrial sites to new uses, which follows the aims of the state's Development and Redevelopment Plan. The plan encourages growth where highways and utilities are in place and discourages it in less developed areas.
Mayor Philip V. Toronto, who likens the area to "bombed-out Beirut" and has spearheaded its redevelopment, said Main Street was where the future of the 2.2-square-mile borough lies. The project, he said, will inject new economic life into the neighborhood, increase the tax base of the entire community and give it back its communal heart.
The borough's old downtown on the southern stretch of Main Street -- an area of small shops now called Memorial Drive -- was replaced under an urban renewal plan in the 70's with strip shopping centers.
THE new Main Street will have a different face, its backers say, helping the borough shed its perceived image as a gritty address. Planned are brick sidewalks, old-fashioned street lamps and a clock tower at the entrance to the project, around which there will be a benches for shoppers. There will be additional seating areas along the river, whose litter-strewn banks will be spruced up.
Mr. Waters said plans for the project, which will be financed mainly by private sources willing to lend on leases secured by creditworthy tenants, call for the county and state to make improvements. Among them will be the widening of Main Street and replacement of the Arnot Street bridge. In addition, the Army Corp of Engineers must dredge the Saddle River to control flooding in the area.
Existing buildings in the area will be razed, triggering the relocation of some 200 families and a nest of businesses. As such the project also speaks to the struggle fully developed towns like Lodi face -- how to diversify their economic bases and enhance the quality of life of residents even though the lives of some residents will be affected in the process.
"With the condition of the land and the hodgepodge of uses, the area, stagnant for 60 years, was generating only one-tenth of the tax revenue it could," Mayor Toronto said. Annual tax revenues from the completed project will rise from the current $400,000 in the area to more than $1.5 million, he said.
Bergen County Executive William Schuber said Lodi's plan, if successful, would have an economic ripple effect on the county and serve as a model that other semi-industrial towns in southern Bergen County could follow.
But with so extensive a project, many challenges exist. They range from getting the government agencies to move forward with the infrastructure improvements to acquiring the land. To date the developers have successfully negotiated with seven property owners for a total of 12 acres, but if the process becomes difficult the borough, which is the redevelopment agent, could use its condemnation powers to acquire the rest of the property.
The cleanup of some sites may also prove difficult, including the two-acre Napp property, which the state's Department of Environmental Protection lists as having PCBs in the soil and ground water.
The company, which is based in Saddle Brook, moved its chemical operations to Coventry, R.I., after the 1994 explosion but has yet to complete a cleanup of the Main Street site. Jon Holt, a company spokesman, said Napp "wants to be cooperative" and has submitted to the state a cleanup plan, which still awaits approval.
In addition, there is the practical hurdle of addressing neighborhood concerns.
"It is the best thing that could happen to the borough and the surrounding towns," said George R. Geswaldo, who operates two businesses in the area that would be affected. "If the area is left the way it is, the town will break down and other towns will suffer."
Mr. Geswaldo manages his family's 38,000-square-foot industrial building on Dell Glen Avenue, where he also operates his stained-glass design business. Five other tenants also occupy the building.
AS a business owner, he said, he considers the redevelopment project "an opportunity to relocate elsewhere in Lodi or in the redevelopment area, providing my business, now off the beaten track, with more exposure." But as a landlord, he added, "I'd like to see the process expedited, because it's hard to do business" in an area whose future will change.
Others, like Angelina Sidari, who has lived for 52 years in her Main Street home, remain resistant, vowing she will not move. "I knew it would eventually happen," Mrs. Sidari, a widow, said of the redevelopment. "Even though it's a rundown area, it's safe and this is my home."
Mayor Toronto said the relocations "had to be weighed against the greater public good." He said that property owners would be given a fair market prices for their properties and that every attempt would be made to move homeowners to comparable housing in the borough.
Mr. Waters added that retailers in the neighborhood would have the chance either to move elsewhere in Lodi or to the redevelopment site, where 20,000 square feet in the initial phase has been designed for smaller users. With the state economy and retail market strong and a trend among shoppers away from malls to traditional downtowns, the developer said, Crown is betting that national and regional retailers, as well as office users, would be attracted to the site.
Kurt Barnard, a retail analyst based in Upper Montclair who publishes Barnard's Retail Trend Report agreed, but with a caveat.
"It is not a full-blown trend," he said, "though there is a sense of revival in some downtowns and retailers are looking at them as having high populations that are underserved." To be successful, he added, there must be a magnet to draw shoppers.
Mr. Waters said the Lodi project's draw would be its supermarket, entertainment uses and the arrival of a national retailer not currently in Bergen County. Beyond the initial buildings, he said, discussions are under way with users for 330,000 more square feet of space.
Mayor Toronto said he was optimistic that once the first phase is started "people will see what can be," and that the rest of the project would fall into place. Not that he thinks it will be built tomorrow. "It takes time to undo 100 years of mistakes, but a solution will be found to every problem," he said, adding, "What is the alternative?"

HEADLINE: The View From/Hampton;
A Writer's World and the Legacy at Trail Wood

BYLINE: By STACEY STOWE 

 BODY:
FORTY years ago, Edwin Way Teale and his wife, Nellie, stood in the doorway of their snug Cape Cod-style house and watched yellow lights in the field opposite them wink on and off in the soft air of a summer evening. That was how Firefly Meadow was christened.
All around Trail Wood, the 156-acre preserve in the town of Hampton that was home for 20 years to the Pulitzer Prize-winning nature writer Mr. Teale, are signs that bear a literary antecedent. 
 It was there, in a cabin overlooking the pond he and his wife commissioned, that Mr. Teale wrote "A Naturalist Buys an Old Farm," the book that chronicles his daily study of the comprehensive array of habitats at Trail Wood: pond and swamp, forest and meadow, and wildflower walk and hay field. The book, long out of print, was reissued last fall by the University of Connecticut's Biblioploa Press.
Before he died, Mr. Teale, an accomplished photographer and an inveterate saver of field notes, journals and book outlines, willed his papers and books to the Thomas J. Dodd Research Center at the University of Connecticut libraries.
For the second consecutive year, the university is sponsoring an Edwin Way Teale Lecture Series (the next is March 23 at the Dodd Center). Economists, poets, political scientists and philosophers from throughout the country address the issue of the environment from the perspective of their discipline. Past speakers, including the poet Gary Snyder, visit the property, now also known as the Edwin Way Teale Memorial Sanctuary, for inspiration before their lectures. Students in the school's Nature and Literature class also visit.
If the University of Connecticut is safeguarding the literary legacy of Trail Wood, then the Connecticut Audubon Society, to whom the Teales willed the property, is its physical guardian. The society has owned the property since Mr. Teale died in 1980 at the age of 81. Mrs. Teale, whose keen abilities as a naturalist were generously detailed in her husband's books, continued to live in the house at Trail Wood until her death, at age 93, in 1993. Last summer, the Connecticut Audubon Society acquired one acre through donation and bought an additional 13.63 acres to enlarge the eastern end of the property.
Between 50 and 100 people visit Trail Wood each month. Audubon staff said the Teale property strengthens the society's presence in the northeastern part of the state. The society also owns the 300-acre Pomfret Farms sanctuary and operates the Ragged Hill Woods 4-H program, based in Brooklyn. The two sanctuaries and center are among 17 Connecticut Audubon Society properties, for a total of 2,500 acres.
The society's plans for the Teale property include continuing guided nature walks, programs for children and adults and maintaining the land as a sanctuary, where the public can visit daily from dawn to dusk, said Sherman Kent, who has been president of the 100-year-old Connecticut Audubon Society for the past decade.
In the warmer months, the public can enter the house and see the study where Mr. Teale arranged notes for his books, chapter by chapter in a metal file cabinet. His Pulitzer Prize for "Wandering Through Winter," sits in a frame on the desk. There is also a small museum in a former barn behind the house that contains several of Mr. Teale's photographs and copies of articles he wrote for Popular Science magazine.
Almost everything remains the same as when the Teales lived at Trail Wood.
"We cut vines and remove branches to keep the trails clear," Mr. Kent said. "We occasionally mow the hay field to stop it from ultimately turning into woods."
On the edge of that former hay field sit an array of wire cages placed over wildflowers that are rapidly going to seed. The cages are part of a study of grasshoppers being conducted by a student at the Yale School of Forestry. "Edwin would have loved it," said Jeff Weiler, who with his wife, Annie Guion, is a caretaker of the property and program coordinator for Audubon. Indeed, it is just that kind of meticulous attention to nature's details that entranced Mr. Teale. Captivated by the bounty of fern varieties on the property, he once counted 2,972 ebony spleenwort ferns in a 200-square-foot area on the property's north woods. Each day before his long hours of writing, he would walk the grounds or lay in a hammock he had strung up in the woods. He routinely spent hours beside Hampton Brook, camouflaged beneath a pile of brush, to observe birds and mammals and insects.
The brush pile still stands, albeit sturdier than in Teale's days. An interior frame was fashioned by the Teale's close friend, Wendell Davis, who is generally acknowledged as the torchbearer of the Trail Wood legacy.
It was Mr. Davis and his wife, Alison, who found the farm in Hampton for the Teales in 1959. They were asked by James Slater, a colleague of Mr. Davis's at the University of Connecticut, if they knew of any houses with for sale with land. The Teales were living on Long Island, where suburbia was rapidly encroaching. The property off Kenyon Road, a former dairy and hay farm with a circa-1806 house surrounded by 79 acres (the Teales ultimately bought more surrounding land) better suited their needs.
Mr. Davis, a former First Selectman of Hampton and past professor of engineering at the University of Connecticut, lives not far away on his own farm. Mr. Davis and his wife, Alison, had long admired Mr. Teale's work and were honored to have the Teales in Hampton. They were kindred spirits; after Mr. Teale died, Mrs. Teale gave Mr. Davis his canoe and camera. Mr. Davis said he believed he was "a kind of marker for them," being roughly the same age as their son David would have been had he survived service in World War II.
Walking the trails with the 77-year-old Mr. Davis is a learning experience. Mr. Davis, whose quiet, erudite manner bespeak a New England gentleman farmer, points out geologic formations, remains of Colonial barns and varieties of trees. He routinely tosses fallen branches off the path and is disturbed to find a gutted deer on one of the trails. In late fall the bones of the trees were visible, along with a vista of Beaver Pond, a body of water the Teales saw transformed from swamp to pond by those industrious creatures.
"There's a lot to love about his place," Mr. Davis said, noting the emerald and pea-green mosses quilting the rocks and the peace of the seemingly boundless woods. After Mr. Teale's death, Mr. Davis formed a volunteer group, Friends of Trail Wood, to insure the preservation of the property.
Earlier in the fall, on a cool, sunny Saturday, a group of eight people had sat around a picnic table adjacent to the house at Trail Wood, to participate in a program sponsored by the Connecticut State Museum of Natural History in Storrs. Several people carried copies of "A Naturalist Buys an Old Farm," others had their own journals. A discussion about Mr. Teale, his life and his work, was led by John Gatta, a professor of the Nature and Literature course at the University of Connecticut and Kurt Heidinger, a graduate student. (Mr. Gatta was one of the professors who conceived the Teale Lecture Series.)
Two women recounted a story they were told about Mr. Teale fording local water in a canoe and tipping over. Others read favorite passages from Teale's work.
"It is a sensuous experience, coming here," said one woman in the group, Elizabeth Austin, a composer from Storrs.
Some who walk the paths at Trail Wood are unaware they are following in the footsteps of a well-known writer. For instance, John Moran and Nicole Krassas of Willimantic, regular hikers, said they were unfamiliar with Mr. Teale's work, but were drawn by the landscape.
"It has hills, meadows, ponds, there's every kind of habitat," Ms. Krassas said.
Mr. Teale shared that observation when he wrote: "It contained woods, open fields, swamps, two good-sized brooks and a waterfall. In my mind I ticked off the list of things we had hoped for in a country home. Miraculously, they all seemed here."

HEADLINE: A Baedeker for First-Time Homebuyers

BYLINE: By JAY ROMANO 

 BODY:
AT times, the struggle to become a first-time homeowner seems like learning to ride a bicycle: You can't help but wonder how something that seems to have been so easy for others could be so difficult.
But perseverance apparently pays. A survey by the Chicago Title Corporation found that more than 46 percent of home purchases nationwide in 1998 were made by first-time buyers. In New York City, the survey found, 52 percent of home sales in 1998 were made to first-time buyers. 
 The combination in recent months of low interest rates and intense competition among mortgage lenders has been making home ownership possible for increasing numbers of first-time buyers, real estate brokers and lenders say. And offerings like a new mortgage program that allows buyers to put as little as 3 percent down for a "handyman's special" -- and include the cost of anticipated repairs in the mortgage -- are making home ownership possible for first-time buyers of more modest means.
Buying a first home, though, is a bit like buying a custom-made suit: it may not have to fit perfectly forever, but it sure should fit nicely now. What follows are some tips, strategies and cautions offered by brokers, mortgage specialists, lawyers and others with long experience in real estate for finding the best fit for the first-time home-buyer's dollar.
"The first piece of advice I give first-time buyers is to figure out how much house they can honestly afford," said Jack Hopkins, an associate broker at Harbor Gates Realty in Greenlawn, N.Y. "The second is to figure out what kind of house they want to live in."
While both suggestions may seem obvious, Mr. Hopkins said, it is not uncommon for those in search of a first home to spend a lot of time looking at houses they cannot afford. And all that does, the Long Island broker said, is make it more difficult to be satisfied with houses within their range.
Finding an affordable house, however, does not always mean finding a less expensive one. "I always explain to first-time buyers that you can work property taxes against the price of the house to end up with more house for your money," Mr. Hopkins said, explaining that a relatively small savings on annual property taxes can create a sizeable increase in the price of the house one can afford. "I show them that at today's interest rates, paying $1,000 a year less in property taxes will enable them to buy a house worth $12,000 more," he said; the increase in buying power comes from having more money available each month to pay the mortgage.
For example, Mr. Hopkins said, someone buying a $150,000 house with a $135,000 mortgage with a fixed rate of 7.5 percent interest for 30 years would have a monthly mortgage payment of $943.93. If the property taxes on the house are $5,000, he said, that would add $416.66 to the monthly payment, resulting in a total monthly payment of $1,360.59.
If, however, the annual taxes on the house are $4,000 instead of $5,000 -- a difference of $83.33 a month -- the purchaser could borrow an additional $12,000 and have the same monthly payment of $1,360.59.
Some buyers, Mr. Hopkins said, particularly young married couples, spend too much time looking at houses they might be able to afford but that one or the other doesn't like.
"I can't tell you how many times I'll sit down with couples who come into my office and find out that neither knows what the other wants," he said, adding that he encourages each to articulate "the house of their dreams" to the other, at times using drawings and cartoons of various kinds of houses to get the conversation flowing with specific examples. And even if they are far apart, he said, knowing what the other wants makes it easier to compromise.
A willingness to compromise is, of course, essential. "You have to keep an open mind," said Gina Guarnieri, a resident of Bronxville, N.Y., who, with her husband, Andrew Ripps, visited more than 50 properties before finding one they both liked in Cortlandt Manor in Westchester County.
LIKE many first-time home-buyers, Ms. Guarnieri and Mr. Ripps started their search with higher expectations than they eventually realized.
"We wanted to try and stay in lower Westchester," Ms. Guarnieri said, explaining that since both she and Mr. Ripps work in Manhattan, they wanted their commute to be as convenient as possible. But since home prices in Westchester generally increase as commuting times decrease, the couple found that they would have to head farther north in the county to get the most house for their money.
"You're not going to find exactly what you want," Ms. Guarnieri said. "There's always going to be something you're going to have to sacrifice."
In fact, she said, location is not the only thing to keep an open mind about.
"Initially, I would have preferred a Victorian or a colonial," Ms. Guarnieri said, adding that her husband preferred a more contemporary home. Both were surprised, then, when they walked into a 2,400 square-foot, three-bedroom contemporary-style home in Cortlandt Manor priced at $324,900 and she experienced the moment first-time home-buyers yearn for. "We called it 'The Feeling,' " Ms. Guarnieri said, that undefinable sense that the house is just the right fit.
And while the couple is negotiating with the owner and declined to say what they are willing to pay, they entered negotiations with a distinct advantage over less-savvy first-time buyers: They have already been approved for a mortgage. "One of the most important things a first-time buyer can do is get pre-approved for a mortgage," said Peter Bell, chief operating officer of Balch Buyers Realty in Mamaroneck, N.Y., the company that helped Ms. Guarnieri and Mr. Ripps.
"I'm not talking about prequalification, I'm talking about getting an actual commitment from a lender for a specific amount of money," Mr. Bell said, adding that obtaining pre-approval from a lender will not only give first-time buyers an indisputable idea of what they can afford -- it may also give them an edge over other buyers.
"We're still in a market where it's not unusual for sellers to get several full-price offers," he said. "And when they have to choose one buyer over another, they're probably going to pick the one who already has a mortgage lined up."
Mary Kay Gallagher, an independent real estate broker in the Prospect Park South neighborhood of Brooklyn, said that applying for a mortgage before starting to look for a house could result in a pleasant surprise for some buyers. "I'm finding that people can usually afford more than they think they can afford," Ms. Gallagher said. "I think it's because of the combination of low interest rates and banks being willing to lend more money with less money down."
In the not-too-distant-past, she said, sellers would get skittish about going into contract with a buyer with a low down payment, fearing that the buyer would ultimately not be able to get a mortgage. That fear is eliminated, however, if the buyer's mortgage has already been approved, no matter how low the down payment may be.
And how low is low?
"First-time buyers can get into a house with as little as 3 percent down," said John Minicozzi, a loan specialist with Norwest Mortgage in Wayne, N.J. "And in some cases, you can even borrow that."
Under a program sponsored by the Department of Housing and Urban Development, prospective buyers who want to save money by purchasing a handyman's special, hoping to improve the property while they own it, can now include the anticipated cost of the improvements in the mortgage.
"This is a great deal for first-time buyers," Mr. Minicozzi said, explaining that the program, known as Section 203(k), can be used to rehabilitate significantly deteriorated property or to make repairs or capital improvements in properties that just need upgrading. Section 203(k) mortgages have no income or geographical limitations, he said, and can be used for one- to four-family dwellings.
The down payment required under the program, Mr. Minicozzi said, is 3 percent. The total mortgage, which is based on the anticipated improved value of the property, cannot exceed F.H.A. loan limits for the area where the property is situated. In New York City and Westchester and Rockland Counties, Fairfield County in Connecticut and Bergen County in New Jersey, the maximum 203(k) loan is $208,800 for a one-family house and $401,375 for a four-family.
A similar mortgage product -- offered through lenders approved by Fannie Mae, a Congressionally chartered, shareholder-owned corporation that is the nation's largest source of residential mortgage funds -- allows buyers to obtain mortgages up to current Fannie Mae limits. Those limits range from $240,000 for a one-family house to $461,350 for a four-family. The borrowers may apply up to 50 percent of the financing to repairs and structural alterations and to nonessential items like sun rooms, swimming pools, saunas and even hot tubs.
Raschelle Burton, a spokeswoman for Fannie Mae, said that the minimum down payment for such loans is 5 percent. Another Fannie Mae program, Flexible 97, allows buyers to obtain mortgages with as little as 3 percent down -- and that 3 percent can be a gift from a family member.
But what can a first-time buyer do if there are no potential benefactors in the family? "You might be able to borrow some money from yourself," said Saul Simon, a certified financial planner in Edison, N.J.
Under current law, Mr. Simon said, a person who has a 401(k) retirement plan can borrow 50 percent of the plan balance, up to $50,000, and use it for a down payment on a house, no matter how the mortgage is obtained. "You're not paying any penalty because you're taking the money as a loan," he said. "Then you pay yourself back at 5 or 6 percent interest and amortize the repayment over five years. It's a great technique."
For those who don't want to borrow money, even from themselves, because it will increase their monthly expenses and so decrease the maximum mortgage they can qualify for, there is another option.
"A person with an Individual Retirement Account can withdraw up to $10,000 without paying a penalty, and then use the money as a down payment on a house," Mr. Simon said. "It's only available for first-time home buyers," he said, adding that the withdrawn money is taxable and must be reported as ordinary income.
EILEEN DALY, an associate broker with Prudential Rand Real Estate in Nanuet, N.Y., said that many first-time buyers believe that the best mortgage for them is an adjustable-rate loan. But, she said, such mortgages, which have a low introductory interest rate that can increase after as little as one year, are a risky proposition in today's market.
"Interest rates are so reasonable today that most people are much better off with a fixed-rate loan," Ms. Daly said. "At least you know your payments are going to remain the same no matter what happens to the interest rate."
Keith T. Gumbinger, vice president of HSH Associates, a mortgage publishing company in Butler, N.J., agreed. "The interest rate on one-year adjustables is about 5.8 percent today," Mr. Gumbinger said, about 1.3 percentage points lower than the current rate for 30-year fixed-rate loans. However, he said, under the terms of most adjustable-rate mortgage agreements, that 5.8 percent will likely jump to 7.5 percent next year, even if interest rates on fixed-rate loans remain the same.
"Adjustables are usually worthwhile only when the difference between the 30-year fixed rate and the one-year adjustable is 2.25 percent or more," he said. "That at least provides you with some fairly substantial savings in the first year and a bit of a cushion in the second."
Some new programs reduce the cost of Private Mortgage Insurance, which is generally required when the down payment is less than 20 percent. The Mortgage Guarantee Insurance Corporation in Milwaukee allows borrowers to reduce their monthly insurance payments by including part of the insurance cost in the mortgage. And Fannie Mae's "Lowest Cost M.I." program, available from lenders who use its Desktop Underwriter system, allows borrowers to make down payments of as little as 5 or 10 percent without having to buy P.M.I.
Of course, innovative mortgage programs won't help a first-time buyer with bad credit -- right?
"Not so," said Gerri Detweiler, education adviser for Debt Counselors of America, a nonprofit debt counseling agency based in Rockville, Md. Ms. Detweiler said that even those with negative marks on their credit -- late payments, repossessions, liens, judgments and even bankruptcy -- can get a mortgage if they have sufficient income.
"For many years, mortgage lenders only wrote A loans," Ms. Detweiler said, explaining that such loans -- typically available only to borrowers with excellent credit -- usually carry the best interest rates and require the lowest down payments.
In recent years, however, increasing numbers of lenders have been writing what are known as B, C and D loans for borrowers with credit histories ranging anywhere from marred to horrible. And while such loans generally require significant down payments and carry higher-than-average interest rates, she said, their availability makes it possible for even those with terrible credit to buy a house.
No matter what a prospective buyer thinks his or her credit history is, Ms. Detweiler said, it is always prudent to call one of the three nationwide credit reporting agencies -- Equifax, TransUnion or Experion -- and request a credit report. The typical fee is $8.
"Ideally, you should do this six to eight weeks before you plan to get pre-approved," Ms. Detweiler said, explaining that if incorrect information is contained in the report, the borrower should obtain reports from the other agencies to see if the mistake is repeated and then advise each agency of all errors. "There will be a form included with the report that can be used to dispute any incorrect information," she said. "Fill out the form and send it in as soon as possible because mistakes don't get fixed overnight."
For negative items that are not removed or credit blotches that are accurate, she said, it is typically worthwhile for the borrower to send the agency a statement giving the borrower's side of the story.
"You're allowed by law to have a 100-word statement added to your credit report," she said. "Just be sure to make it straightforward, honest and factual."
Once first-time buyers have decided what kind of house they're looking for and where they are going to look for it, and once the best available financing is in place, the only thing left is start looking.
"The biggest mistake first-time buyers make is buying as the result of an emotional decision," said Enid Hamelin, director of advertising and public relations for Lawrence Properties, a Manhattan brokerage company. "They walk into a house or apartment and the first thing they do is visualize where the nursery is going to be and what it will look like."
And while getting "the feeling" about a particular house or apartment is undoubtedly important, Ms. Hamelin said, it is just as important to keep in mind that buying property is an investment. "This is business," she said. "And one has to do one's homework."
For example, Ms. Hamelin said, a prospective purchaser looking at a co-op or condominium apartment should try to talk to as many people in the building as possible -- particularly the superintendent or other building employees -- to obtain as much first-hand information as possible.
Those buying houses, she said, should make a trip to the buildings department in the town where the property is situated and ask to see whatever documentation is on file for the house.
"You might find out that your dream house is built on a landfill," she said.
One of the most important things a buyer can do, she said -- particularly a first-time buyer who may not be familiar with how a house works -- is hire a competent engineer to inspect the property.
"You want somebody who is going to do a hands-on inspection," she said. "You want the house inspected inside and outside, from top to bottom. You want an inspector who will be able to tell you exactly what you're buying." House inspections can cost from several hundred dollars to $1,000, Ms. Hamelin said, depending on the type and location of the property.
Richard L. Heimer, president of Heimer Engineering in Huntington Station, N.Y., said that a similar price range applies to co-ops and condominiums. While such inspections cannot cover a building's structural details, he said, they are nevertheless important because they emphasize items unique to the apartment.
ANDREW BRODNICK, a White Plains real estate lawyer, said that it is also important for first-time buyers to accompany the engineer or inspector while the inspection is being performed. That, he said, will allow the buyer to ask specific questions about appliances and systems in the house. In addition, he said, it would be very helpful for a buyer to obtain a copy of the survey for the property and ask the engineer to walk the property lines with the survey in hand and the buyer in tow.
"It's easy to think you own a section of property that really belongs to your neighbor," Mr. Brodnick said, adding that a buyer should also determine, with the help of the lawyer who will handle the closing, whether there are existing easements or rights-of-way that give others use or access to the property. "I've seen easements where the next-door neighbor has a right to use a driveway but has no obligation to plow it," he said.
Jerome Billingsley, an owner of Frances Billingsley Realty in Katonah, N.Y., said that first-time buyers looking in an area they are not familiar with should drive around the neighborhood -- a lot -- at different times of day. "Drive into town one way and out another," Mr. Billingsley said. "Drive around at 8 o'clock on a Monday morning to find out where the traffic is and drive around on Friday night to find out where the teenagers hang out."
And once zeroed in on a particular house, he said, get out of the car and walk.
"Knock on the neighbors' doors, talk to them, find out what they like about the neighborhood and what they don't like about it," he said. "If you're moving into a development, talk to people who live there and ask if there are any problems with the houses. They'll probably be able to tell you something the broker doesn't even know."
If, after all that, Mr. Billingsley said, a house still seems right, be decisive. "In this market you've got to move quickly," he said. "I know many a person who has found a house they love, but then gone and seen a couple of dozen more only to come back and find the first house already in contract."
And finally, he said, every buyer should resist the urge to be "penny wise and pound foolish" when negotiating in a seller's market. "I've seen quarter-million-dollar sales fall apart over a $250 chandelier," Mr. Billingsley said. "If the seller wants to take the chandelier, let them have it. You can always buy another."

HEADLINE: Tax Reassessment Bid Lacking on Wish List

BYLINE: By DONNA GREENE 

 BODY:
WHEN Westchester tax rates were set last December there seemed to be little correlation between the budget the county had adopted and what some local governments were being billed, raising a cry from County Legislators for a state law that would let the county change its system of assessment.
But for the second year in a row, a request for state authorization to make changes in methods of assessment, upon which tax rates are set, is not on the county's wish list, reflecting a division among legislators and concern that any proposal that does not have the support of the business community might be vetoed by Gov. George E. Pataki, as he did with a reassessment plan in 1996. 
 Only in a letter accompanying its 1999 state legislative package approved earlier this month do County Executive Andrew J. Spano and the Board of Legislators even mention overhauling the tax-assessment system, saying, "Westchester shall continue to work to eliminate the inequities among existing property tax bills." Toward that end, the letter said, the Westchester Municipal Officials Association is working to "identify and develop along with the business community, acceptable options to deal with this problem."
In contrast, in its requests sent to Albany, the county most wants the state to grant it a higher reimbursement rate for federally mandated programs to teach handicapped preschoolers and continued authorization to impose an extra 1 percent sales tax. The preschool program will cost about $68 million this year. The sales tax raises about $80 million a year, part of which is shared by the county government with local governments and school districts.
In 1996, the State Legislature, at the urging of a bipartisan majority of county legislators, approved a bill that would have directed the county government to reassess all its property within five years, phase in any increases that some homeowners could face and allow the county to set up a so-called classification system, by which businesses could be taxed differently (presumably at a higher rate) from residences. That bill was vetoed by Governor Pataki, who said at the time it could have "unintended, devastating consequences for local economies." The veto came in the aftermath of an 11th-hour lobbying effort against the bill by some county-based corporations, including Pepsico and I.B.M.
Proponents of reassessment say many parcels in the county have not been reassessed for years and contend there are large disparities in taxes paid by property owners with nearly identical parcels. Opponents cite a shift of the tax burden to businesses, which the legislation might cause.
The confusion that the tax system creates was dramatized last December when the county enacted a 1999 budget that decreased by 0.65 percent the amount it collected in property taxes but still resulted in double-digit property tax increases in some communities while lowering them in others. The disparity is caused because each local government uses different assessing practices and assesses property at a different percent of full value.
Two key members of Westchester's delegation to the State Legislature say they are ready to carry the ball again on reassessment when -- and if -- the county asks them to.
State Senator Nicholas A. Spano, Republican of Yonkers and chairman of the Westchester Republican Committee, said: "The County Executive has indicated he has been working with municipal officials to craft an agreement that business can also sign on to. If that happens we're prepared to act."
He and Assemblyman Richard L. Brodsky, Democrat of Greenburgh, said they support proposals to tax business property at a higher rate than residential property. Mr. Brodsky called it unfortunate that the county has not yet acted, saying, "The business community and real estate guys have lobbied very effectively, which they have every right to do."
The two lawmakers did not think it was likely that the county would get a higher reimbursement for programs for teaching handicapped preschoolers. One program serves children up to age 3 and the other up to 5. The county maintains that the state has reneged on a promise to reimburse counties for almost 70 percent of some of the programs' costs, paying instead 50 to 60 percent. Westchester argues that the state should pay 75 percent.
Mr. Brodsky said: "We're always looking to improve and control these programs and get as much money as possible, but it has never been an effective tactic to accuse someone you're trying to work with of having broken promises, especially when it's not true. It's one of many budget issues we have to fight, including a big battle on the Governor's attempt to cut back on special ed funding."
Mr. Spano said: "I have to be realistic. This is an issue with ramifications outside of Westchester," and so would be very costly to the state.
As for the sales tax, the two Legislators are divided. Mr. Brodsky opposes -- as he has unsuccessfully in the past -- the extension of the extra 1 percent sales tax; Mr. Spano supports it. The 1 percent sales tax, first enacted in 1991, is in addition to other sales taxes collected in Westchester by the county, the state, some cities and the Metropolitan Transportation Authority. Total sales taxes within the county range from 6.75 percent to 8.25 percent.
In its package to the state legislators, the Westchester lawmakers wrote: "Without an extension of the Westchester County Property Tax Stabilization and Relief Act, the county will be forced to find alternative revenue sources and/or cut service to make up for the losses," adding, "Regardless of how the revenue is made up, it is certain that the end result will be significant erosion in the quality of life for all Westchester County residents."

HEADLINE: THE ENVIRONMENT;
Proposal for Huge Mall in Meadowlands Is Mired in Debate

BYLINE: By GEORGE JAMES 

DATELINE: CARLSTADT

 BODY:
The Meadowlands has been viewed as many things: a shelter for wildlife, a water filtration system and a dump. And it has also been seen, because of its location a half-dozen miles from Manhattan, as a prime location for development.
Now a proposal for a huge mall amid the acres of brown, brittle weeds called phragmites has been working its way through a review process involving Federal and state agencies that resembles a snake digesting a pig. 
 The approval process -- aimed at regulating development in some parts of the 32-square-mile marshland bordered by 14 communities while preserving the environment in others -- is a complex and lengthy one.
"Projects in the wetlands are extremely contentious and controversial," said Joseph J. Seebode, chief of the regulatory branch of the Army Corps of Engineers in the New York District. He could have been talking about a hearing last week at the Hackensack Meadowlands Development Commission, when opponents argued over the economic and environmental effect of the project.
The Meadowlands Commission is considering a variance that would eliminate a provision for construction of residential housing adjacent to the mall. Another variance would eliminate a buffer zone that would join two tracts for the construction. Further hearings are scheduled for Wednesday and March 29, and a vote on the variances is scheduled for April.
"The process may be lengthy," Mr. Seebode said, but we think it is an objective process to evaluate these projects."
David J. Charette, a consulting engineer from Warren who is working for Mills Corporation of Arlington, Va., the mall's developer, said the process allows the regulatory agencies, the public and other parties to to address all the issues and make informed decisions. ""It can be very time-consuming, said Mr. Charette,"which, obviously, from a developer's point of view means: time is money."
The process apparently is so complex that it took a full day for the Hackensack Meadowlands Commission to come up with a description of it. Officials also declined to discuss the Mills proposal while the project is under review.
The mall, at 2.1 million square feet, would be the largest in the state. Consisting of brand-name retail outlets, a score of specialty stores, a multiplex theater, a dozen restaurants, office towers and a 1,000-room hotel, it would cost $1 billion to build.
The plan, which would encompass about 590 acres, would make it the biggest project in the Meadowlands after the 750-acre sports complex, which was built in 1974.
The company is seeking a permit from the Army Corps of Engineers, which has Federal oversight of wetlands, to fill in 206 acres on which the actual complex would be built, a move opposed by enviromentalists, and the two variances from the Hackensack Meadowlands Development Commission, a state agency with planning and zoning jurisdicton.
Under the plan, Mills would also spend $25 million to restore 380 acres of what is now primarily a polluted expanse covered by the tall, thick, brown phragmites. On a recent visit visible amid the reeds was a disembowled washing machine, a rusted wheel well of a car and other urban litter.
This area to be restored encompasses two-thirds of the overall project site: a 550-acre site bounded in the east by the western spur of the New Jersey Turnpike, Paterson Plank Road in the south, Washington Avenue, which is lined by industry to the west, and the Hackensack River to the north and another 40 acres to the east of the turnpike.
Many environmentalists fear that allowing Mills to fill so large a space will result in even more development.
But many area officials and labor leaders support the project, saying it will bring an estimated 2,500 construction jobs and 9,000 permanent jobs.
A plan by Mills to fill in 206 acres of wetlands currently is being held up as the Corps develops an environmental impact statement. In the Corps review process, a developer submits a permit application to fill in wetland. The Corps requests more information, and receiving that, issues a public notice about the project.
The notice generates comment from the public and governmental agencies. A public hearing on the Mills project generated "a lot of public comment," Mr. Seebode said.
"As a result of that process. we determined that the project warranted a full environmental impact statement," Mr. Seebode said.
The next step will be to issue a draft environmental impact statement for public comment and a public hearing. Comments will be incorporated in the final environmental impact statement and be sent out for another 30 days for public review.
The Corps then will collect and evaluate the comments and issues a record of decision, which concludes with a decision.
Mr. Seebode said the draft environmental impact statement on the Mills project should be out by early summer. He described the date for a final decision to this point as having been "a moving target." But he added, a decision is expected before the end of 1999.
The Corps works closely with the Hackensack Meadowlands Commission, which must determine whether a project complies with the Coastal Zone Development act before the Corps can consider granting a permit.
In the meantime, a decision by Federal authorities is pending on a "special area management plan," proposed by the Meadowlands Commission, that would limit the number of wetlands that could be filled and developed.

Lower Interest Rates

BYLINE: By ELSA BRENNER 

 BODY:
The state's Mortgage Agency has dropped its interest rate, under a low-interest-rate program, to 5.5 percent. To expand the number of families eligible for its programs, effective March 1, the program, commonly known as Sonyma, also increased the household income limits for house buyers.
"We're making the American dream of home ownership more attainable for hard-working New York families," Gov. George E. Pataki said. 
 For Westchester residents, that means raising the limit for a family of three from $91,880 to $111,860, the second-highest limit in the state. In Rockland, the income limit for a family of three rose from $92,690 to $112,840 -- the highest income limit.
The Low Interest Rate Mortgage Program provides up to 97 percent financing on one- to four-family dwellings, including condominium units, and 90 percent financing for cooperative units and mobile homes.
Since 1970, the program has given more than 110,OO0 families a chance to buy houses through various programs. Sonyma's home ownership programs are primarily financed with tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds. Financing is made available through a network of 96 lenders. For more information, home buyers can contact the agency's toll-free number, (800) 382-4663.

The most common source of water pollution is runoff -- from city streets, parking lots, marinas, construction sites, logging sites and roadways -- and it threatens the public health and the economy of coastal communities. That is the conclusion of a report released by 20 organizations, including Save the Sound, an environmental group in Glen Cove and Stamford.
In the state, 100 percent of the shellfish bed closings are attributable to polluted runoff, John Atkin, president of Save the Sound, said. In Connecticut, the number is similar, with 96 percent of the closings caused by polluted runoff. 
 "If Long Island Sound and the tributaries that feed it are to see marked improvement in the next decade and beyond," it will require a more focused effort by governments of both states and local governments to address the polluted runoff portion of the equation, particularly the impact of storm water," Mr. Atkin said.
Surrounded by one of the most densely populated areas in the United States, the Sound is particularly vulnerable to pollution, the report says, adding that as the area grows, the pressures on wetlands, forested areas and undeveloped lands also increases. ELSA BRENNER

N.Y.U. Hospital Plans a High-Rise, to Neighbors' Dismay

BYLINE: By BERNARD STAMLER 

 BODY:
For years, the vacant lot in the block bordered by Beekman, Spruce, Nassau and Gold Streets has been used as a hospital parking lot. But last week, the president of New York University Downtown Hospital told a Community Board 1 committee meeting that financial pressures are forcing the hospital to put up a building, perhaps as tall as 45 stories, on the site. Many neighbors reacted warily to the plan.
The hospital was established in 1920 after a terrorist bombing at the Wall Street headquarters of J. P. Morgan pointed out the need for medical care nearby. Known for many years as Beekman Downtown Hospital, it became New York University Downtown after affiliating with New York University Medical Center. 
 Whatever its name, the hospital, just a few blocks south of Chinatown, has long suffered financially because of its large immigrant clientele.
"We serve four to five times as many Medicaid patients and three to four times as many uninsured patients than, say, New York Hospital," its president, Leonard A. Aubrey, told a meeting of Board 1's Seaport-Civic Center committee on Tuesday night, a session that was attended by more than 20 local residents. He noted that the state had classified the hospital as "financially distressed" in 1995. Its affiliation with New York University Medical Center provides the hospital with access to the larger institution's experts and its managed care contracts, but no additional subsidies, he said.
"The idea of the building is to help the hospital survive," Mr. Aubrey said. "We have a very serious problem facing us in the coming years."
He said that development of the parking lot, deeded to the hospital long ago as part of an urban renewal project, offers a unique opportunity to raise badly needed money. The hospital does not expect to complete plans for at least a year, he said, adding that he envisions a building with an outpatient clinic, assisted living quarters for the elderly and market-rate apartments. To make the project profitable, he said, variances would be sought from the city to allow a building of 800,000 to 1 million square feet, or 40 to 45 stories.
Neighborhood residents who attended the meeting questioned whether the building needed to be that tall. Phil Toy, the president of the co-op board of 140 Nassau Street, adjacent to the parking lot, said he feared that construction might damage his building, as did recent work on the parking lot.
Others wondered whether the restrictions of the urban renewal deed, which requires the site to be used for a "health facility," would be satisfied by the mixed-use structure that Mr. Aubrey proposed. Most in attendance fretted about the noise and dirt of construction, and the prospect of losing their light and views to the new building.
"It terrifies me," said Lori Lasch, who has lived for 10 years at 140 Nassau Street. "If they build it, I'll never be able to keep my windows open." BERNARD STAMLER

HEADLINE: Trying To Stay True to The Street

BYLINE: By LESLIE KAUFMAN 

 BODY:
WHEN Daymond John, the co-founder and chief executive of Fubu hip-hop clothing, drives through his old neighborhood in Hollis, Queens, he leaves no doubt that he has moved on -- and up.
His Bentley, royal blue with a matching pinstripe on the cream-color upholstery and so new that plastic wrap still covers the wood paneling, makes heads spin in this working-class enclave. Mr. John shook his head when he saw two women walking by to inspect the car. "I haven't brought it around here before because it makes us look unattainable," he explained. 
 Appearing attainable is no small concern. Fubu stands for "For us, by us." The company, which was founded in 1992, has prospered by promoting itself as a black-owned label by and for young urban men. The founders, who also include Carl Brown, Keith Perrin and J. Alexander Martin, all from Hollis, insist that "For us, by us" is not a call to racial exclusiveness, but clearly race is part of their appeal. "Customers see our pictures and can relate, whereas they couldn't relate to some 45-year-old man living in Italy," Mr. John, 30, said. "We are just like them. We are the consumer."
In other words, Fubu's origins give it street credibility. And these days, street credibility translates into sales. The company says its revenues rocketed nearly tenfold, from $40 million in 1997 to a stunning $350 million last year, which catapults it beyond a niche market into a league with labels like Donna Karan ($670 million) and Tommy Hilfiger ($847 million.)
But because Fubu's success is so dependent on its homeboy appeal, this wow-wow growth carries risks. If the company is going to expand as much as Mr. John and his partners would like -- and in the last year they've added everything from backpacks to a men's suit line -- it will have to do even more business with middle-class, mainstream America. The problem is that nothing destroys the urban buzz of a label quite so fast as having Westchester teen-agers clamor for it. Tony Shellman, vice president of Enyce, a Fubu competitor, predicts, "Fubu is going to lose its street essence as little Johnny in suburbia starts picking up its stuff."
For now, the brand is having an it moment. Not only is the rapper LL Cool J, a company spokesman, seen wearing Fubu designs (he sports Fubu's signature oversize football and hockey shirts), but also stars like Janet Jackson, Will Smith and Whitney Houston. At night, Mr. John and his partners make the scene with style players like Sean (Puffy) Combs, the rap impresario. They recently received an award for black economic enterprise from Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani. Mr. John, who wore a black, sueded rubber Fubu track suit to Gracie Maison to accept it, took the attention in stride. "Just business," he explained.
Coming up fast, however, are copycat competitors who say they have a better bead on the street's needs than Fubu. These days it seems that every other rap and inner-city entrepreneur is hawking his own line of baggy fashions.
At some of Manhattan's most fashion-conscious emporiums of urban gear, Fubu is already losing ground to challengers like Phat Farm, Mecca USA and Enyce (pronounced en-EE-chay). At Transit, today's must stop-and-shop, on Lower Broadway, Nikki Abreu, a manager, said: "We dont even carry Fubu anymore. It wasn't selling that much. Enyce is the hottest."
Because Fubu is privately owned, it does not have to publish its sales figures, and, in fact, next year it won't. Some analysts speculate that it is a sign of trouble. But Mr. John and his partners don't appear to be panicked by their rivals. Short, thick and supremely confident, Mr. John is the de facto company spokesman and persona. He brags that Fubu has a far closer relationship with customers than other clothing labels have.
"How many companies do you know that get 5,000 E-mail messages a day?" he asked. The E-mail often includes detailed design suggestions. Some of those, Mr. John said, like making a soft leather jacket covered with small embroidered patterns, have been followed up by Fubu.
Mr. John is too smooth to say so, but he clearly keeps close tabs on how his company is faring on the streets. He does not want his Bentley mentioned in this article, for example, because "people might get the wrong idea."
The founders also keep a high profile in the old neighborhood, doing good works like handing out Thanksgiving turkeys and filling the Christmas wish lists of needy local children.
In the end, the Fubu men rely on one another to stay grounded. All of their clothes, whether designed in the house by Mr. Martin or by outside licensees, have to be approved by three of the four partners. They make a wide range of products, from the core men's casual line, emphasizing oversize cuts and bright colors, to footwear and lounge wear (think red satin robes a la Hugh Hefner).
"If we all like it, it'll probably sell," Mr. John said confidently. Whatever the changing public perception, he believes that he and his partners are too rooted in their community to be cut off from it by a little flash and money.
Their life story, as he tells it, is a Horatio Alger tale updated for the VH-1 age. In 1992, Mr. John was waiting tables at a local Red Lobster and working any get-rich scheme he could think of. These included, as he told Vibe magazine this month, dealing crack cocaine. "It wasn't until I started the company that I didn't have something crooked going on," he was quoted as saying by Vibe.
Although being known as a former drug dealer may enhance a rap star's "street cred," it is no asset for a businessman whose clothes are manufactured and distributed by Samsung, the Korean electronics giant. Mr. John declined to comment on the Vibe article. A company spokeswoman, Leslie Short, said, "Those remarks were taken out of context, and frankly I am very angry."
Fubu began modestly enough. The fashion rage at the time was wool hats with their tops cut off and tied with string. When Mr. John saw the hats being sold for $20, he corraled a next-door neighbor, Carl Brown, to help sew up a bunch. The two sold their homemade headwear for $10 a pop in front of the New York Coliseum. They made $800 in a single day, and a clothing label was born.
There were years of struggle as Mr. John and Mr. Brown (whose job now is to handle licensees), joined by Mr. Martin and Mr. Perrin (who now manages celebrity relations), moved into Mr. John's mother's house and sewed logos on hockey jerseys and sweatshirts. Their first break came in 1993, when they convinced LL Cool J, a double-platinum rapper, who grew up a just few blocks from Mr. John's home, to pose in a Fubu T-shirt. It took months more of cajoling and sitting in on video shoots to persuade him to wear the line while performing. When he did, Fubu started taking off. The rapper, a paid spokesman for the company since 1996, managed to pull off a perfect bit of insider subversion by wearing a Fubu hat in an advertisement he did for the Gap a couple of years ago.
Mr. John says the company also found motivation in what the partners perceived as efforts by white-owned outdoor apparel brands like Timberland and North Face, popular with inner-city youths, to distance themselves from the customers who were making them street chic.
Fubu's marketing played off a sense of shared resentment at being ignored. Gritty pictures of Fubu's founders, posed with exposed tattoos, reversed baseball caps and a hint of gang-style menace, started popping up in magazine advertisements and even on the company's labels. The message was clear enough to the initiated.
"I knew what they were talking about, and it made me happy," said Tracii McGregor, executive editor of The Source, a magazine on hip-hop culture. "The way they are marketing is unmistakably black."
But gangsta style has it limitations, said Irma Zandl, president of a youth marketing consulting firm in New York. "There is something about their premise that is a little alienating for nonblacks," she continued. "I've had white kids say to me, 'They don't want me to wear this.' "
David Watkins, president and chief executive of Icon Lifestyle Marketing, a marketing company that focuses on urban areas, said that even if this were true, concessions of any type to the suburban market would be the wrong way to go. So far, Fubu has done well, he said, because "they have let people outside the market come to them, instead of the other way around."
He offered Fubu a bit of Shakespearean advice: "They just have to keep their marketing message the same -- and be true to themselves."

HEADLINE: INVESTING;
A Goodbye To the Weight Of Leveraging

BYLINE: By LAURA M. HOLSON 

 BODY:
WHEN RJR Nabisco Holdings' plan to split itself into two companies made headlines last week, a notorious chapter in the history of corporate restructuring came closer to an end. But no one waxed nostalgic for the good old 1980's.
Instead, a collective sigh could be heard as RJR, a symbol of that era's daring experiment in financial engineering, began its transformation back into two companies, as was the case 14 years ago. 
 The leveraged buyouts of that decade -- when financiers like Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Company took over established companies using immense issues of high-yield debt, hoping to whittle them into lean operations and sell them for a profit -- did little for the target companies. According to KDP Investment Advisors, a Montpelier, Vt., research firm, of the 25 cases between 1985 and 1989 where companies were saddled with more than $1 billion in high-yield debt, almost half defaulted on their loans. Even more filed for bankruptcy or sold off substantial assets. Meanwhile, bond holders who got stuck with the junk watched its value drop.
"It was called 'the Debacle,' " said Kingman Penniman, president of KDP, referring to the number of companies that could not pay their debts. "A lot of these investors were not creators of new companies."
The debacle was due, in part, to a slowing domestic economy early in the 1990's. Companies burdened with billions in loans and faltering earnings stumbled under the strain -- perhaps most notably RJR Nabisco, which might have split up sooner, or grown its food business faster, were it not for its big interest payments, among other things. Many debt-laden companies emerged as more efficient operations, but not without great personal and social costs.
Still, companies and investors learned several lessons. And experts say it is questionable whether the United States market will again see the types of deals that were common a decade ago. The percentage of junk bonds borrowed by leveraged-buyout firms hovers at 15 percent of all high-yield offerings, said Dwight Sipprelle, co-head of global high-yield operations at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, down from 50 percent peak levels in the 1980's.
Companies today are less apt to borrow without good reason. "It's cheaper for companies to issue stock than debt," Mr. Penniman said -- though, of course, interest rates are lower on today's junk bonds. And corporate managers have greater personal incentives, in the form of stock option packages, to increase shareholder value.
 BOND issuers, too, have become more disciplined as the high-yield market has matured. "Some things are just too risky and won't get done," Mr. Sipprelle said. Still, high-yield debt is one of the few remaining investments that can deliver double-digit returns, so many investors will snap up bonds representing even the most aggressive financing.
Another change from the 1980's is that corporations are now more likely to use junk bonds to finance expansion as well as acquisitions, particularly in hot growth areas like telecommunications, cable and media. This harkens back to the period before the leveraged-buyout boom, when respected companies like MCI Communications and Time Warner used junk bonds to jump-start their growth in the late 1970's and early 1980's.
Viatel, a fledgling global long-distance provider that went public in 1996, borrowed $900 million through high-yield debt in 1998 and is raising more money that way to help expand its network.
Of course, consolidation, the major theme in this decade's merger wave, is still a driver of the leveraged market. Last week, Allied Waste Industries, along with two financial buyout firms, announced a friendly acquisition of the trash hauler Browning-Ferris Industries, financed in part by borrowing $9.5 billion.
Europe, too, is discovering American-style merger financing. Consider Olivetti's $60 billion hostile bid for Telecom Italia. Such a bold move would have been unthinkable a few years ago, in part because continental Europe essentially had no high-yield market.
So what is the biggest risk in this era's high-yield lending? The same one that caused the last debacle: a downturn in the economy or an industry.
"When the stock market is humming along, things are great," said Steven N. Kaplan, a professor of finance in the graduate school of business at the University of Chicago. "The risk is -- and this has not yet been tested in this market -- if there is a downturn and companies have to make interest payments. If you can't make it, you've got a problem."

HEADLINE: INVESTING WITH: William V. Fries;
Thornburg Value Fund

BYLINE: By CAROLE GOULD 

 BODY:
THE idea, as always, is to buy low and sell high -- but that doesn't mean that William V. Fries looks only at stocks with tiny price-to-earnings ratios.
A low ratio can sway him, of course, but Mr. Fries, who runs the $297.4 million Thornburg Value fund, has a more elastic definition of "value" than many of his peers. And investors tend to take notice: Thornburg Value had an annual average return of 29.7 percent in the three years through March 5, compared with 28.5 percent for the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, placing it in the top 2 percent of mid-cap value funds, according to Morningstar Inc., the financial publisher in Chicago. The fund returned 14.2 percent in the 12 months through March 5, below the 22.6 percent of the S.& P. but still in the top 4 percent of its peer group. 
 Thornburg Value has achieved such performance in part by thinking small -- in portfolio size. The fund holds just 42 stocks, compared with 111 in the average value fund, according to Morningstar.
Mr. Fries, who is 60, favors three broad categories of stocks: the basic-value companies that are the bread and butter of his trade, but also what he calls "consistent growers" and "emerging franchises."
He chooses basic-value stocks -- which account for 56 percent of the fund's assets -- by using traditional yardsticks like low price-to-earnings and price-to-book ratios and high dividend yields. For these stocks, which tend to be clustered in the financial services, energy and telecommunications industries, he aims to pay no more than two-thirds of the market multiple -- the average price-to-earnings ratio of all S.& P. 500 stocks -- or about 22, lately.
The consistent growers, including pharmaceutical and consumer products companies, are 20 percent of the fund. "Typically these companies will be less cyclical or have more reliable top-line earnings growth," said Mr. Fries, who is willing to pay the market multiple for them.
He is willing to pay a premium, however, for his emerging franchises -- generally fast-growing companies that are not yet well-established in new or changing industries. "These stocks are a lot more risky and tend to grow much faster," he said in a phone interview from his office in Santa Fe, N.M. For these companies in the portfolio, he projects average earnings growth of at least 15 to 20 percent. (Emerging franchises account for 17 percent of the fund; most of the remainder is in cash.)
Mr. Fries sets a target selling price for each stock in his portfolio and veers from it only if the outlook for the company shifts significantly. For example, he has raised his target price for Charles Schwab & Company -- he won't specify how much -- because it has become a big force in Internet stock trading.
Most value-fund managers favor stocks with P/E ratios in the single or low double digits, but Mr. Fries can scour for bargains at much higher elevations. "We have a couple of positions in companies that haven't produced much in the way of earnings, like semiconductor manufacturers, and that drives up the P/E," he said.
Technology stocks account for more than 20 percent of the portfolio -- unusually high for a value fund. But he said prices were so cheap for some of these stocks last summer that he couldn't resist buying shares of Intel, Brooks Automation and Lam Research.
 ONE of his favorite basic-value stocks is El Paso Energy, a natural-gas company. Because of the company's extensive holdings overseas, the stock weakened last fall, when Mr. Fries began buying shares at $25 each. It closed on Friday at $35.75, or 17 times his 1999 earnings estimate of $2.10 a share. He predicted a three-year earnings growth rate of 10 percent.
Mr. Fries also sees big potential in American Home Products, a pharmaceutical company in which some other investors see mostly a dearth of blockbuster drugs. "It's been very good at making acquisitions, taking the costs out and boosting the revenues of acquired products," he said. He began buying the stock at $49 last June and projects a three-year earnings growth rate of 12 to 15 percent. It now trades at $65.375, about 33 times his 1999 earnings estimate of $2.
In the emerging-franchise category, Mr. Fries likes Advent Software, which produces software used by investment advisers to track, report and reconcile stock trades. In his view, Advent's software is the most popular and economical on the market. Given the aging of America and all those retirement nest eggs to be managed, he projects that Advent's earnings will climb 20 to 30 percent a year, on average, over three years.
He began buying Advent shares in November 1997 at $24 and recently added to his holdings. The stock now is at $48.875, or 31.5 times his 1999 earnings estimate of $1.55.

They began betting last fall that the final days of 1999 would bring worldwide panic about potential Year 2000 computer glitches. They speculated that nervous people and businesses would hoard cash, putting a severe strain on banks and driving up borrowing costs for anyone needing credit. 
 By the end of the year, the traders had driven December 1999 futures prices to levels that, in effect, projected a devastating jump of about 13 percentage points in dollar interest rates at the end of this year. They did it with trades known as "butterflies" that usually look a bit like the insects when their components are charted. By December, the charts for the "millennium butterfly" -- the purchase of a September 1999 contract, the sale of two December 1999's and the purchase of a March 2000 -- had wings at the sharpest angles in memory.
The trading was greeted as an overdue guest by Year 2000 alarmists, who had been longing for evidence to support their predictions that Y2K, as the computer problem has been nicknamed, would make huge waves in the markets. It also grabbed much attention in banking circles. "We are all looking for road signs as to what will happen," a Year 2000 project manager at a major New York bank confided at the time.
The road sign has since been flattened, though, along with those who were certain it pointed somewhere. By last month, December futures prices had tumbled back into their traditional relationship with the September and March contracts. Participants were left wondering what to make of it all.
"I think it was a bubble rather than anything substantive," said Galen Burghardt, a senior vice president at Carr Futures, a brokerage firm based in Chicago. "If you really got a sense people couldn't bank at year-end, all hell would break loose."
The aborted flight of the futures butterfly has reinforced the prevailing sentiment that it does not pay -- so far, at least -- to bet that Year 2000 problems will produce any sharp moves in stocks, bonds and other mainstream markets. Some managers say it is a mistake to think that bets on Y2K will ever be rewarded.
"By definition, the stock market only moves on surprises, since today's prices reflect expectations," said Kenneth L. Fisher of Fisher Investments in Woodside, Calif., which manages $2.9 billion for institutions and private clients. "Y2K is no surprise."
 GIVE Mr. Fisher a gold medal in the Understatement Olympics. It would be a feat these days to find an investor who has never heard that the decades-old practice of using two digits in computer dates, like "99" for 1999, could trip up computers, programs and electronically controlled machines reading year 2000 dates. The "00" might be read as 1900 or not recognized as a valid date; some malfunctions lead to shutdowns and others to faulty calculations.
Still, many investment advisers and managers are not quite as confident as Mr. Fisher that the market has anticipated Y2K: Everyone may know that Y2K is coming, but there is great uncertainty over how extensive disruptions will be, where they will strike and when their impacts will be felt by individual companies and nations. Prices may plunge where disruptions hit or skyrocket where they do not.
Well before Jan. 1, some analysts say, the prospect of volatility could force trillions of dollars in investment portfolios to be rearranged as managers try to reduce their risks. If that happens, those who move before the crowd will, as always, pay less to achieve their goals. So even skeptics must be poised to jump.
"It's a puzzle to me," said Jonathan Muehl, a pension fund adviser at Buck Consultants in Pittsburgh, who sees no sign yet of Y2K hedging activity in options prices. (An option is the right to buy or sell a commodity, a stock or an entire basket of stocks for a specific price at a specific date in the future; a future is an obligation to complete such a deal.)
Mr. Muehl says options that would protect investors from sharp stock-portfolio declines in the trading days before 2000 currently sell at the Chicago Board Options Exchange and in over-the-counter trading at prices that imply almost no increase in the risk that stocks will gyrate later this year.
"It could be that the market isn't concerned, but part of me wonders whether the market has really focused on the issue yet," Mr. Muehl said.
The prevailing wisdom -- reflected in a report this month from a United States Senate special committee tracking Y2K as well as recent analyses by leading Wall Street brokerage firms -- is that overseas markets are especially vulnerable to Y2K problems. Most countries started dealing with Y2K later than the United States, and many developing nations are hard pressed for resources.
Just last month, the Global 2000 Coordinating Group, an international organization of more than 230 banks, insurance companies and other financial institutions, dropped plans to publicly rate the readiness of 35 key countries after regulators fretted privately that such a move could ignite a disruptive flight of capital. But lagging nations -- and the businesses within them -- may have received only a temporary reprieve.
"It is probably too early for Y2K factors to dominate an investment decision," said George A. Murnaghan, executive vice president and marketing manager at Rowe Price-Fleming International in Baltimore, which manages $30 billion for mutual funds and institutions with international portfolios. "As the year goes on, it will become more important."
To be sure, there has already been plenty of action involving the stocks of companies like Viasoft Inc. and Data Dimensions that have been beneficiaries of the billions being spent to repair Y2K defects.
Starting in 1996, such stocks soared -- and often later crashed -- as investors placed bets on how big the repair effort would be and which companies would profit most. Now all those players are treating Y2K as history as they race to convince Wall Street that they have viable strategies to prosper when the Year 2000 work dries up.
 BUT such investments were never bets on either the actual impact of Y2K or on how individuals and business will act in the final run up to it. Other than the butterfly, which involved contracts so large that only large institutional investors and professional traders at the Merc waded in, the only hot Year 2000 investment action to date has been in market niches like gold and silver coins, where small investors are chasing limited supplies.
The coins are being snapped up not only as investments but also because many alarmists see them as valuable assets for barter if the Year 2000 banking collapse they foresee comes to pass. Demand was so strong for 1998 Silver Eagles that the United States Mint ran out in early December; the 1999 version is already in short supply.
"The shortages are just driving demand higher," said David Harper, editor of Numismatic News, a weekly newspaper for coin collectors, based in Iola, Wis. He said many dealer quotes for the coins have been running at more than triple the once-common $1.25 premium to spot silver prices.
He recently wrote an editorial that warned of the potential for a crash in the coin markets if, as most experts predict, Y2K disruptions turn out to be minor in the United States. Prices may also dive if the Mint sharply increases its output this year, he said.
The coin markets are being stoked by feverish talk on the Internet of inevitable catastrophe come the millennium. More respected voices -- like Edward Yardeni, the chief economist at Deutsche Bank Securities, who gained a following on Wall Street for correctly forecasting the market boom of the 90's -- couch their warnings in terms of probabilities. Mr. Yardeni currently says there is a 70 percent chance that Y2K breakdowns will usher in a global recession and that the most likely impact on the stock market is a 30 percent to 40 percent decline.
Investors who bother to look up Mr. Yardeni's full analysis, however, might sit tight. He expects a major rebound in 2001 and sees the Dow Jones industrial average, currently at 9,876.35, reaching 15,000 by 2005. Of course, if he and other forecasters who are relatively gloomy about Y2K are correct, there are huge profits to be made by selling now and buying just after prices tumble.
"The market is currently priced for perfection, and that just won't happen," said Dennis G. Grabow, chief executive of the Millennium Investment Corporation, a Chicago-based investment adviser to pension funds with $20 billion in assets.
Mr. Grabow advocates dumping investments in emerging markets, urban real estate and the chemical industry, among others, in favor of Government bonds. He expects a "flight to quality" to drive up demand for such bonds, creating profits for those who hold them. Investors, he said, can easily move their money back into stocks once markets have absorbed a Y2K hit.
The market is not accurately anticipating Y2K, Mr. Grabow argued, because analysts are talking to their usual sources, like corporate financial officers, instead of those lower down the ranks who are managing repair work and testing.
But Mr. Grabow's view has been, at best, premature. He had predicted that anticipation of Y2K would send stocks down 25 percent last year; in fact, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 26.7 percent. Small investors who saw Tony Keyes on Oprah Winfrey's television program last year and snapped up his book, "The Year 2000 Computer Crisis: An Investor's Survival Guide" (Y2K Investor, 1997), may also have turned defensive too soon.
"I've left a lot of money on the table," conceded Mr. Keyes, a former computer systems analyst turned Washington talk-radio host.
He outlines many investment choices in his book but chose a defensive posture emphasizing Government bonds for himself. Though he largely missed the latest leg of the bull market in stocks, he added, the upside is that he has been sleeping well.
Such experiences underscore the exquisite timing skills that Y2K financial bets require -- exactly the kind of market timing that many Wall Street professionals and financial advisers tell investors to avoid. Not only are there varying theories of when disruptions might strike -- it could take months, for example, for overseas problems to hurt many American businesses -- but it is also difficult to predict when investors might start reacting.
Mr. Fisher, the California money manager, is fond of calling stock markets "The Great Humiliator."
He said he could easily envision a "relatively normal correction" this year in a market that has reached record prices. Such a correction, he said, could become exaggerated if "Y2K people come screaming out of the woodwork." Investors trying to time the market, he added, could be lured into foolish selling.
Others warn that even in the event of a New Year's debacle, the reactions in financial markets might not all be so obvious as a race into Government bonds. Y2K problems might not send markets tumbling in Asia, for example; so much money has already been pulled out of troubled stock markets there that major investors might simply delay reinvestment instead of selling more.
Or how about this twist: Big companies with no Year 2000 problems might face selling pressure if mutual funds see selling those stocks as the least costly way to build up cash to buy stocks they regard as unfairly beaten down. That picture seems plausible to the chief strategist of one of the country's biggest pension funds.
"We're long-term investors, but we're also opportunistic," he explained, speaking on the condition of anonymity.
 OF course, while institutions may have a variety of deft strategies for jumping on opportunities, history suggests that many will end up outwitting themselves if Year 2000 trouble develops. In every recent downturn, the big institutions have done the bulk of the misguided panic selling and small investors a large proportion of the timely buying.
One could easily imagine Y2K producing a similar result. Many of the most skittish small investors are already out of the market and into coins or other defensive investments. If trouble hits, they will not be around for the panic selling.
Instead, those left may well be mostly long-term investors perfectly willing to snap up any bargains the institutions create in their race to the exits.
 
From One Bug to Another
 UNCERTAINTY about the Year 2000 computer problem has popped up in the pits at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, where 90-day Eurodollar futures are traded by institutions trying to protect themselves from swings in interest rates.
Normally, the further away the period covered by a 90-day Eurodollar futures contract, the higher the projected interest rate, just as a loan due further in the future will usually carry a higher rate because of the added risk. In other words, today, a June futures contract -- which embodies the market's guess at what interest rates will be from mid-June to mid-September -- would be priced to reflect a lower rate than a September contract, which projects rates from mid-September through mid-December.
One common exception to the price patterns occurs because banks often need extra cash near year-end, especially over the New Year's holiday, when the Federal Reserve is closed. Speculating that the supply of money will be tight enough to force up interest rates temporarily, traders take a "butterfly" position across the September, December and March contracts.
When turned into a chart, this phenomenon usually shows what looks like gently angled "wings" from the September and March contracts to the December "body" between them. That implies a modest interest-rate increase the last day of the year. A typical trading pattern was seen last Nov. 13, shown in Chart 1.
However, late last year, Year 2000 fever drove implied interest rates way up for December 1999 futures, giving the butterfly sharply angled wings. At its peak on Dec. 28, the contract price indicated that traders expected a rate jump that was far larger than normal at the end of 1999, as shown in Chart 2.
By late February, the patterns were closer to normal. Since then, the trend has edged toward slightly more nervousness. But volume has dropped sharply, indicating that many traders have decided that the butterfly spread this year is too unpredictable to trade. Chart 3 shows the current picture.
How is the year-end butterfly turned into a calculation of projected interest rates? The difference between the projected December interest rate and the rate of the contracts on either side of it, September and March, is seen by banks as a starting point for estimating by how much market interest rates in the London currency market, where the Eurodollars are traded, will exceed the Federal Reserve overnight bank lending rate over the New Year's holiday.
Because the three-day New Year's weekend beginning Dec. 31, 1999, is one-thirtieth of the 90-day contract period, bankers simply multiply the difference by 30 to come up with a number that roughly approximates how much the market expects interest rates to jump at the end of the year.
As Chart 3 shows, traders still expect rates to climb, but not nearly to the extent that they did in December. BARNABY J. FEDER

HEADLINE: From Brighton Beach to America;
The Wave of Immigrants Began 25 Years Ago. Soon Russian Filled the Streets. Now, the Tide Is Ebbing.

BYLINE: By EDWARD LEWINE 

 BODY:
AN arc of gray seagulls banked against a cold gust of wind and wheeled high above Brighton Beach toward the Atlantic Ocean. Sofia Garber followed the birds with her big blue eyes and pulled the fur collar of her coat to her cheeks. Standing on an expanse of boardwalk between a line of apartment buildings and the sand, Ms. Garber, 51, reflected on her life as a new immigrant, part of the first wave to arrive in Brooklyn from the Soviet Union in 1973.
"I used to work all day in the city," said Ms. Garber, who emigrated from Odessa, a Ukrainian resort city on the Black Sea. "Then I would come out here on the sand to think and cry. I didn't know what my future would be and my children's future. I would stare at the seagulls and think: 'They are so free. They can fly to Odessa to see my mother and I cannot.' " 
 The first years were hard for Ms. Garber, but things improved. She and her husband worked 14-hour days at a variety of jobs, made some money, moved to a larger apartment in Brighton Beach, brought her mother over and sent two daughters to college. Brighton Beach is her home, Ms. Garber said, but she is glad her daughters, 31 and 25, have moved to suburban Westchester and Long Island.
"I feel that life has to go on," she said. "I wouldn't be happy if my children should stay in Brighton Beach. Maybe different people should be able to come to Brighton Beach and start over. That is what America is about."
It has been about 25 years since the first immigrants from the Soviet Union came to this small neighborhood in southern Brooklyn, where the rents were cheap and you could walk by the sea, and turned it into a Russian-speaking hub.
Brighton Beach has been many things to these people: at first a disappointment, then a beachhead in a big city, then an economic launching pad. And now, for many of them, it seems to have become a stepping stone to somewhere else.
Many residents say Brighton Beach is on the cusp of a slow decline as a Russian-speaking neighborhood. The children of the immigrants are chasing the American dream to Manhattan, to other parts of Brooklyn and to the suburbs. "Old people live in Brighton Beach," said Lyudmila Reyngach, the owner of Oceanview Optical on Brighton Beach Avenue. "The young people are moving out." She said that she had been doing more and more business on weekends, when people who have moved away return to shop.
And while immigration from the former Soviet Union has slowed in recent years, people from Mexico, Pakistan and the Middle East have been moving in. "It's going to be different," said Marina Shapiro, the executive director of the Brighton Beach Business Improvement District. "It will be a multinational neighborhood, not just a Russian one."
Recent census surveys suggest that 200,000 immigrants from the former Soviet Union live in the five boroughs, said Andrew A. Beveridge, a sociology professor at Queens College. And Brighton Beach still throngs with Russian-speaking people. More than half the stores on Brighton Beach Avenue are owned by immigrants from the former Soviet Union, and many residents say it will take decades for the neighborhood to lose its flavor.
Sofia Vinokurov takes a positive view. She arrived with her family of 27 in 1975 and owns a food store called the International -- the Zabar's of the neighborhood -- as well as a smoked-fish business and a nightclub. "Young people aren't moving out that much from this neighborhood," she said recently, as customers bustled around her. "You see young people with carriages and babies."
Yet like Little Italy and the Lower East Side before it, many residents said, Brighton Beach is falling victim to the very success of its recent settlers. Lydia Vareljan, the chairwoman of the Russian Division of the United Jewish Appeal, who came from Odessa in 1976 and lived for a decade in Brighton, said: "Ask me what will happen to Brighton Beach. What happened to Hester Street in the Lower East Side? But not yet. We have another 25 years, and I am sure that something will still be there, but not like it was from 1983 to 1990."
 
In the Shadow of the El, Memories of the Baltic Sea
The neighborhood of Brighton Beach bridges the 20 blocks between the gimcrack attractions of Coney Island and almost suburban Manhattan Beach. Its main street, Brighton Beach Avenue, is shadowed by the elevated D and Q subway lines. There are apartment buildings on the ocean side of the avenue and small houses on the other.
Eastern European Jews began moving into the neighborhood in the 1920's, and Jewish refugees after World War II. By the 1970's, many of the older Jews had died or moved to Florida or to their children's homes in the suburbs. Shops along Brighton Beach Avenue were small and old, longtime residents said. "It was very dirty," Ms. Garber recalled.
But rents were cheap. The shopkeepers could communicate with the new residents in Yiddish or Polish. And the many immigrants from seaside cities like Odessa and Leningrad appreciated the shore atmosphere. "It was ocean side, and I was growing up on the Baltic Sea," explained Leonid Bogorad, who came from Leningrad in 1973. "It made me feel better."
The story of Brighton Beach as a Russian-speaking enclave began in the mid-60's, when rumors spread through the large Jewish populations of the Soviet Union, from Leningrad to Ukraine to Belarus to Moldavia, that the Government might allow some people with family in Israel to leave. Mr. Bogorad said he heard the rumor in 1970. He was in his mid-20's, and like many of the first immigrants was prosperous by Soviet standards. "Believe me, I was doing O.K.," said Mr. Bogorad, who managed a furniture store. "In Russia if you had access to imported furniture you can make money."
Like Mr. Bogorad, the early immigrants were not fleeing severe deprivation but anti-Semitism. On one hand, the Soviet Union suppressed the practice of Judaism, so most Russian Jews knew little about their religion. On the other hand, Jews could not forget who they were. They were often called Zhid, a Russian curse for Jew, beaten up in school and denied access to scholarships and the best jobs. The internal passports of most Soviet citizens indicated what region they were from, while the passports of Jews read "Jewish," no matter where they were from.
"There was anti-Semitism everywhere," Mr. Bogorad said. "Whenever you apply for anything you have to show your passport that says you are Jewish."
Officially no one was supposed to want to leave the Soviet paradise, but small numbers of Jews were allowed to emigrate beginning in the 50's. Emigration gained momentum in the mid-60's when American Jewish organizations and the United States Government pressured the Soviet Union to let the Jews go. The Israeli defeat of Soviet-backed Arab forces in the Six-Day War of 1967 slowed things a bit, but by the early 70's the American policy of detente and the Soviet Union's need for American grain opened the gates.
According to the National Conference on Soviet Jewry, in Washington, 17,000 people left the Soviet Union from 1968 through 1971. Most headed to Israel, but a few thousand went to the United States. Soon reports were filtering back to the Soviet Union of a strange place called Brooklyn. "In Odessa everyone was talking about Brooklyn," Ms. Vareljan said. "A letter would come, and we would all read about it."
Dr. Lawrence Avramenko, 54, who has the crew cut and broad chest of an army sergeant and the stern demeanor to match, said he was an emotional mess on the day in 1973 when he, his wife and child left Kiev on a train bound for Austria. Dr. Avramenko, a dentist, and his family were leaving their relatives, friends and possessions for a world they had never seen. They were allowed to take out $100 a person and some clothes. Going back was not an option. "I couldn't sleep," Dr. Avramenko said of that first night on the train. "I was crying as we checked into Austria."
Most immigrants went to Vienna, where they were met by Israeli officials. Some, however, decided to go to the United States instead, because they had family there or they figured economic opportunities would be better, or because they feared becoming enmeshed in Middle East tensions. The Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society, a nonprofit group that resettles refugees, helped them get to the United States, via Italy.
New York did not make a good first impression on many of the 1970's immigrants. To Simon Feldman, 63, a Russian who spent seven years in a Soviet prison during the 1950's, the city he glimpsed on the way from John F. Kennedy International Airport seemed depressing. "It was cold," he said from his home in Florida. "It was dark. I was disappointed to see all the painting on the subway trains."
The New York Association for New Americans, a private, nonprofit agency, arranged for housing, health care, language training and social services for the immigrants during their first few months and sometimes up to a year. Those who could not be connected with family in the city were sent to single-room-occupancy hotels until they could find a place to live.
Ms. Garber does not remember the experience fondly. "It was mices and cockroaches," she said. "Don't ask. It was hot, but I was afraid to open a window. I think someone is going to kill me." After a few days, she said, someone suggested that she look for an apartment in a neighborhood called Brighton Beach.
 
From Factories and Diners To Chandeliers and Wallpaper
Two and a half decades later, in early February, the United Jewish Appeal held a glittering fund-raising party at a restaurant called Cabaret Lido in Marine Park, Brooklyn, a few miles east of Brighton, to celebrate the 25th anniversary of the arrival of Sam and Ludmila Kislin, who came from Odessa and made a fortune in commodities.
Guests were greeted by an actor in a Russian commissar's outfit who interrogated them and gave them a "visa." They then passed through a curtain marked "Vienna" in Cyrillic letters and into a buffet room marked "Italy." Finally doors marked "America" were opened, and the 150 guests dined in a hall decorated with Stars and Stripes and Statues of Liberty.
There were grand bouquets of flowers and bottles of vodka and cognac on each table. The guests came dressed to kill. Women wore lots of makeup. Suits and dresses were cut in untraditional ways. Some men wore diamond studs in place of ties. The buffet featured Russian pastries, pates, seafood, sushi (a Russian favorite), vegetables, breads, cheeses, cold cuts and caviar. And that was before dinner.
But amid the festivity there was also a note of nostalgia. "It is a time of mixed feelings," one guest said. "Twenty years ago it was not such a happy time. It was hard work."
For the new immigrants, life in New York was initially about getting through the day, learning English and making some money at whatever job they could find and keep. Mr. Bogorad spent his first five years in factory jobs in the garment district. Ms. Garber was a waitress on the 4 A.M. shift at a local diner. Later she took a job kneading dough at a knish shop. When Ms. Vinokurov, a friend, wrote to her from Odessa asking if she should follow, Ms. Garber told her not to, delaying her by a year.
"I told her, I'll get down on my knees," she said. "I am suffering here, do not come. This is another tragedy for the Jewish people."
The first immigrants in Brighton Beach, no more than a few hundred, according to old-timers, were so busy eking out an existence that few had the time, energy or money for much in the way of communal life. But things slowly improved. Ms. Garber's mother came from Odessa and helped take care of the children so that Ms. Garber could go to school and acquire office skills, and eventually a job in the diamond district. Her husband, from whom she is now divorced, and a friend opened a wallpaper and chandelier shop on Brighton Beach Avenue.
Mr. Bogorad took a job driving a taxi 15 hours a day, and also sold real estate in the evenings. "I was exhausted," he said. "But I was young, and if you are trying to raise a family you can't be tired."
By 1975, some emigres were buying buildings with storefronts along Brighton Beach Avenue, which sold for as little as $5,000. Not that the businesses were an immediate success. Many struggled to learn how to make things work in a new place. "Those who opened in 1975 and '76, they failed," Ms. Vareljan said. "But by 1978 and '79 those that opened, they succeeded."
 
The Soviet Gates Open And Then Close Again
In 1978, Soviet immigrants began pouring into Brighton Beach. The Soviet authorities, courting the world in preparation for the 1980 Olympics in Moscow, loosened restrictions, and from 1978 to 1980 some 23,000 came to New York, more than twice the number that had arrived in the previous five years. This influx, bringing thousands of new customers, was a boon for owners of Russian-speaking businesses.
They also had people to advise. "The first ones who came, everybody called us," Ms. Garber remembered. "They called my house the Red Cross."
From 1982 to 1986, when the Soviet Union was occupying Afghanistan and President Ronald Reagan was getting tough on what he called "the evil empire," immigration to New York slowed to a trickle: fewer than 500 people a year. But there were already so many immigrants in Brighton Beach that the area hopped with ethnic shops. The restaurants, in particular, became a center of social life as they never had been in the Soviet Union. There, people ate at home. In New York, the immigrants learned to let someone else cook.
Many, though, had a difficult time adjusting to American life. Mark Handelman, the executive vice president of the New York Association for New Americans, said that refugees from the Soviet Union mistrusted the Government and yet expected the Government to do things for them. They often withheld information from their social workers, whom they considered to be government agents, Mr. Handelman said, and became indignant when housing and jobs weren't provided for them. "They didn't understand that when they went for an interview they didn't have the job yet," he said.
American Jews had donated tens of millions of dollars to assist the Soviet Jews in settling in the United States, yet there was resentment on both sides.
"There was a great clash between the American Jewish community and the Russians," said Pauline Bilus, director of resource development at the Shorefront Y.M.-Y.W.H.A. of Brighton-Manhattan Beach, an American who has worked with Russians since the 70's. "The Americans wanted them to be the humble, traditional Jews of their grandparents' generation."
Unlike the rural religious Jews who came from Eastern Europe a generation or more before, most Soviet Jews were well-educated city dwellers with little religious feeling. Some resented criticism of how they practiced Judaism from Americans who, as they saw it, had had it easy. Yet there were also hurt feelings when the Americans got angry. "They kept their shops open on the major Jewish holidays," Ms. Bilus said. "And they wondered why the American Jews didn't embrace them." Today, Ms. Bilus said, the shops close on Yom Kippur.
These days, the crowds who wander underneath the el on Brighton Beach Avenue still speak Russian as they browse the little stands that sell pastries from all regions of the former Soviet Union. They still stop before the hulking marble facades of fancy restaurants and read the announcements of performances by the latest Russian stars. A co-op complex going up at the east end of the neighborhood, by Coney Island Avenue, has a long waiting list with many Eastern European names.
The last big wave of Russian-speaking immigrants arrived in the late 80's and early 90's after the Soviet Union collapsed. More than 20,000 came to New York in 1992 alone. But these new immigrants were different. They were better educated, had more money and knew more about the United States. Not all of them were Jewish, and greater numbers of them were illegal immigrants, coming in from their now open country on tourist visas and staying. Yet, residents say, the old-timers and the newer immigrants seem to coexist well.
Still, the neighborhood is changing, residents say. Though no figures are available on how many immigrants from the former Soviet Union currently live in Brighton Beach, locals say many immigrants, and particularly their children, are leaving or have already left. Leonid Bogorad, who continues to work in Brighton Beach, moved to Long Island in 1978. Simon Feldman lives in Florida. Lydia Vareljan moved to suburban New Jersey. None of their children lives in Brighton.
Now people from other lands are moving in. "Years ago the plane would come into New York from Russia, and they would come to my office with the luggage," said Mr. Bogorad, referring to his real estate business. "Now we have all different groups of clients: Pakistanis and Indians, Spanish. The neighborhood is mixing up."
Immigrants from the former Soviet Union have spread out to Manhattan Beach, Bay Ridge and Bensonhurst in Brooklyn, Bergen County in northern New Jersey and Nassau County, Long Island. That has hurt Brighton, Mr. Bogorad said.
Even the Russian mafia has been forsaking Brighton Beach. "In the 70's Russian organized crime concentrated mostly in New York," said Raymond Kerr, the supervising agent in the Federal Bureau of Investigation's Eastern European Organized Crime Unit. "Now it's in cities all over the country."
 
'The Right Time For the Right People'
But more threatening to Brighton's identity over the long term, some say, is the decline in immigration. The executive vice president of the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society, Leonard S. Glickman, said he expected the trend to continue. He attributed it to tighter American immigration policies and the fact that many people in the former Soviet Union who have family in the United States (a prerequisite of legal immigration) have already come.
"There is a dwindling number of people in Russia who could qualify," Mr. Glickman said. "And the Government has made it harder for them to assert a credible fear of persecution."
The director of refugee programs for the Immigration and Naturalization Service, Kathleen Thompson, agreed that immigration had declined, but said the rules had not changed. "There is a dwindling number of people in Russia who would qualify for the U.S.," she said. Yet she acknowledged that rising anti-Semitism could spur new immigration.
So far the effects of the decline have been small, Brighton business leaders said,, though the founder of the Brighton Neighborhood Association, Pat Singer, said some restaurateurs had told her they were seeing fewer customers. "But they aren't strangling," she said. "They are doing well." She pointed out that new restaurants have opened in recent years.
Russian Brighton Beach has come further, and more quickly, in its first 25 years than other ethnic neighborhoods in New York. Perhaps that is one reason many old-timers do not seem worried about its future. They have gone through too much to be overly sentimental. If the blessing that Brighton has been to them is passed on to another group, so be it. As Mr. Bogorad said: "Brighton Beach came by at the right time for the right people. It was our place for so many years. One day it will be for someone else."

HEADLINE: Private Sector;
Restoring the Junk Bond King

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK 

DATELINE: BEVERLY HILLS, Calif.

 BODY:
THERE, on one stage at a conference, sat some of the best economic minds in the nation -- Gary Becker, Nobel laureate; Merton H. Miller, Nobel laureate; Douglass North, Nobel laureate; Myron S. Scholes, Nobel laureate, and Michael R. Milken, fallen financier.
Having the dethroned junk bond king rub shoulders with Nobel laureates was not all that incongruous. As a brochure from the conference notes, The Wall Street Journal once described Mr. Milken as "arguably the most important financial thinker of the century." Besides, it was Mr. Milken's party, and he could crow if he wanted to. 
 The Milken Institute Global Conference, which ended on Friday, is part of the resurrection of Mr. Milken. Since leaving prison in 1993, he has enlisted his personal fortune and wide network of contacts in an effort to become an influential force in medical research, education and economics.
His Association for the Cure of Cancer of the Prostate, formed after the disease was diagnosed in Mr. Milken, has given away $65 million, much of it from Mr. Milken himself, becoming the leading private sponsor of prostate cancer research.
His Milken Family Foundation, run with his brother, Lowell, makes awards of $25,000 each to about 150 teachers annually, part of an effort to improve education.
And Mr. Milken, 52, barred from securities trading for life, is rebuilding a business empire in education. His Knowledge Universe has quietly acquired companies in businesses ranging from day care centers to computer training, with combined revenues of $1.2 billion last year. One unit, a corporate consulting firm called Nextera Enterprises, has filed to go public.
The economic conference was sponsored by the Milken Institute, his small research center. In addition to the Nobel laureates, speakers included Gov. Gray Davis of California, Mayor Richard H. Riordan of Los Angeles and former Representative Lee H. Hamilton of Indiana. Reggie Jackson, the former baseball star whom Mr. Milken enlisted to spread cancer awareness among minorities, sat by Mr. Milken's side at the opening dinner.
Perhaps it was only a coincidence that the conference was at the Beverly Hilton Hotel, site in the 1980's of several of Mr. Milken's extravagant junk bond conferences, known as Predators' Balls. In a coincidence of timing, however, the conference took place the week when the largest and most celebrated deal Mr. Milken financed, the 1989 buyout that created RJR Nabisco, was undone by RJR's decision to break itself apart.
Those at the conference, at least, seemed to care little about his past. Supporters said Mr. Milken was active in philanthropy long before he went to jail and is spending too much time and money for it to be a charade. Besides, they ask, what's wrong with trying to improve one's image by doing good?
"As far as I'm concerned, you don't hold it against someone for the rest of their lives," said Dr. North, a professor at Washington University in St. Louis. "My view is he's doing generally constructive things now, and they are worth supporting. He's using his money more intelligently than a lot of rich people do."
Mr. Milken declined to be interviewed. But in a brief conversation he discouraged any interpretation of his motives, saying of the conference, "It is what it is," and adding, "It takes time for people to not be emotional about things."
Mr. Milken served two years of a 10-year sentence for violating securities laws, and after leaving prison in 1992 was diagnosed with cancer and given 12 to 18 months to live. The cancer, though, is now in remission, and Mr. Milken is vigorous. But his sense of having limited time has made him as driven and obsessive as he was in his days at Drexel Burnham. He has staff meetings at 6:30 A.M. and calls aides late at night when ideas occur to him, which is all the time.
But the cancer has also made Mr. Milken stop to smell the roses, literally. Besides conventional treatment, he has turned to alternatives like meditation and aroma therapy, having flowers planted around his house and smelling them to bolster his immune system. He has gone to a low-fat, high-soy diet and even been co-author of a cookbook, from which proceeds go to cancer research.
The cancer foundation is given credit by scientists for accelerating research and changing the way it is done. But Knowledge Universe, while growing rapidly, still must prove it can change education, as opposed to merely changing the ownership of companies already in the business.
The Milken Institute and its Global Conference are the least significant of Mr. Milken's activities in terms of time and money. Even some institute officials acknowledge that so far it has had little impact on public policy.
Founded in 1991, the Milken Institute became a haven for young Ph.D.'s to do scholarly but obscure research. In 1997, Donald H. Straszheim, then chief economist at Merrill Lynch, was brought in as president, expanding the staff and shifting toward work of interest to businessmen and politicians rather than academics.
This second annual Global Conference is part of that effort. Peter Passell, formerly a business reporter for The New York Times, is revamping the institute's magazine, with a new, sprightlier version being sent free to 10,000 influentials.
Most of the institute's young researchers were dismissed or quit, complaining that serious scholarly work was less valued than was preparing slides for the conference.
"Mike has always been very unhappy with the institute, and it has never accomplished what he wants," a former researcher said.
Another said: "I think he wants basically nothing more than a venue from which to address the public."
Things are still in flux, and the institute is still searching for a firm footing. "Changing a culture is not easy," Mr. Straszheim said.
 BESIDES appearing with the Nobel laureates, Mr. Milken delivered one of his trademark speeches to the 1,000 people in the audience, an hourlong ramble that meandered from the return on investment of the Louisiana Purchase to the ethnic mix in Los Angeles, but along the way he emphasized his perennial themes -- the need for capital sources other than banks, the necessity for medical research and the importance of education and human ingenuity.
"Money has long ceased to be a major determinant in the creation of value," he said. Though for Mr. Milken, who once made $550 million in a year, money helps in moving him back into the limelight. But the value of his legacy, which he cares deeply about, will be based on more than that.

HEADLINE: The Nation;
Running With (and From) a Famous Name

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE 

DATELINE: DES MOINES

 BODY:
ANNOUNCING her Presidential exploratory committee here last week, Elizabeth Dole invoked the last Republican hero, Ronald Reagan. Three days earlier, presenting his own committee in Austin, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas mentioned the first Republican hero, Abraham Lincoln.
Neither made even a reference to two of the biggest names in Republican politics today, who also happen to be their most prominent supporters: Bob Dole and former President George Bush, respectively. Both were conspicuously absent from the events. The closest Mr. Dole came to appearing with his wife was in one of seven blown-up photographs that served as the backdrop. (Mr. Reagan got equal billing: There was a photograph of him and Mrs. Dole.) 
 A Bush or a Dole has popped up on every Presidential ballot since 1976. But by distancing themselves from their famous family members, the latest Bush and Dole candidates to seek the White House demonstrate the complications -- the drawbacks as well as advantages -- of belonging to political dynasties.
Despite their individual accomplishments, Mrs. Dole and Mr. Bush would not be such hot tickets -- they are swamping the G.O.P. field in early polls -- were it not for their pedigrees. Behind the scenes, they have been eagerly tapping into their families' extended financial and political networks.
Asked the obligatory questions by reporters about his father, Governor Bush repeated his well-practiced reply after his announcement last week: "I inherited half his friends and all his enemies. I'm working on the other half of his friends -- and trying to peel off a few of his enemies."
For all the voters who regard the Bush and Dole names as famous, others view them as infamous. So the two newest national contenders are forced to make a purely political calculation: How closely do they want to be identified with losers? Who can forget that Mr. Dole, the former Senate Republican leader, suffered a humiliating defeat to President Clinton in 1996? Or that former President Bush was ousted from office by him in 1992?
"The trick is very straightforward, to try to get all the benefits of the famous name -- and none of the negatives," said Nelson Warfield, Mr. Dole's press secretary in the 1996 campaign. "The spotlight would not be nearly as bright for Elizabeth if her last name were Doyle. But any losing campaign leaves bad memories, so too much deja Dole can hurt her."
Both candidates are sensitive to the suggestion that they are riding on familial coattails. Governor Bush, who earned $14 million from a minority investment in the Texas Rangers baseball team, is a widely popular Governor in his own right; Mrs. Dole served in five Administrations, twice in the Cabinet.
Both are determined not to be compared to the Kennedys, whose patriarch, Joseph Kennedy, was perceived as prodding his sons into politics. Americans "are a robustly anti-dynastic culture," said Tony Dolan, Mr. Reagan's former chief speech writer, who recently met with the elder Bush in Texas. "George W. has to make clear that he doesn't think he has a right to inheritance."
MRS. DOLE'S newly hired pollster, Linda DiVall, distinguished her candidate from another spouse of a famous politician -- Hillary Rodham Clinton -- who is toying with running for the Senate from New York. "She is not running because she is the spouse or out of any sense of entitlement -- or what we see with Hillary Clinton," Ms. DiVall said. "And there's no attempt to hide him. But she needs to establish her individual identity."
In personality alone, the candidates cannot be accused of being spinoffs of their more celebrated -- in some cases, scorned -- kin. Mrs. Dole, who has never been elected to office, is a regimented perfectionist; her husband, a veteran politician, is known for his looser, seat-of-the-pants approach.
Bristling at contrasts to his father, Governor Bush cited his distinct upbringing and achievements. "I went to Sam Houston Elementary School in Midland, Texas," he said last week. "And he went to Greenwich Country Day in Connecticut. I married Laura; he married Barbara. He was never a governor, and, therefore, it's hard to get an apples-to-apples comparison."
But comparisons are inevitable, particularly since both candidates have refused to answer questions about their positions on crucial national and international matters. That has left their rivals to fill in the blanks. Naming no names, two familiar Presidential candidates, Lamar Alexander and Steve Forbes, himself the scion of the publishing tycoon Malcolm Forbes, recently sought to get at the son by condemning the father's promise of a "kinder and gentler" nation.
Voters have been left to assume -- rightly or wrongly -- that Governor Bush's and Mrs. Dole's philosophies do not diverge appreciably from that of former President Bush or Mr. Dole. Despite the Governor's popularity in the polls, for example, surveys continue to show that many Republicans confuse Mr. Bush with his father. And in random interviews at Republican events, participants who favor abortion rights often remark that Governor Bush's anti-abortion stand was tolerable because they remembered that his father once was on their side.
THE failure of Mrs. Dole and Governor Bush to define themselves has left Republicans searching for hints. That Richard G. Darman, President Bush's budget director, has been nowhere to be seen in his son's organization has sent a signal that the Governor has a more conservative economic philosophy. Many conservatives blame Mr. Darman for talking the President into the politically fatal tax increase in 1990.
From the opposite perspective, many conservatives groused last week about Mrs. Dole's hiring of Ms. DiVall because she has worked for Planned Parenthood and the National Education Association, which are seen as liberal organizations. (Ms. DiVall says she has also had many conservatives on her client roster, including Senator Phil Gramm of Texas and Newt Gingrich.) In assembling a staff, Mrs. Dole has pointedly reached beyond her husband's advisers from 1996.
Here in Iowa, one of Mr. Bush's top supporters, State Senator Thurman Gaskill, said voters should not expect the Governor to campaign alongside his father. Mr. Gaskill, who was also a big backer of the elder Bush, explained, "Conservatives always had some reservations with President Bush, and that's who the Governor has to appeal to. He wants to make them feel a little more comfortable."
For all their determination to break free, Mr. Bush and Mrs. Dole can take heart that Vice President Al Gore, the Democratic front runner, dare not attack them for their lineage. After Mr. Gore was picked as Mr. Clinton's running mate, his father, the late Senator Albert Gore Sr. of Tennessee, remarked that his namesake was destined for the White House, saying, "He was raised for it."
 
Don't Look Too Far
 THOSE unschooled in the nuances of Presidential candidates' announcements and exploratory committees may picture experts huddled around a table deliberating whether their candidate should take the plunge.
Unveiling his 10-member exploratory panel last week, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas said he was "grateful they will take time to help me make this decision."
But the Bush exploratory committee has no immediate plans to meet. What's to explore? The Governor himself said he would back out only if his candidacy were greeted with "a large thud."
Elizabeth Dole did not disclose her committee members' names last week because there aren't any. "That's a legalism," explained Mrs. Dole's senior strategist, Kieran Mahoney.
By registering an exploratory committee with the Federal Election Commission, contenders can begin collecting money for travel and early organizational efforts. But it is not required; candidates could just as easily create full-fledged campaign organizations.
Why do many hopefuls maintain the fiction that they are exploring when there is little doubt of their intentions? If their campaigns collapse early, they can make a graceful exit, saying that -- technically -- they were never in the race. And why announce in one grand event if you can build the drama?
As one Federal Election Commission official put it, "A lot of this is going through the hoops just for the political mileage." RICHARD L. BERKE

HEADLINE: PORTFOLIOS, ETC.;
The Euro's Fickle Fingers Foil Many a Plan

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER 

 BODY:
IN January, with the arrival of the new single European currency and forecasts that the American economy would slow down in 1999, European stock markets seemed as though they would be a pretty good choice for American investors.
But that has not been the case so far this year. Although Europe's major markets other than Germany have done nearly as well as the United States for local investors, the returns for Americans in those markets are smaller or even negative. 
 This disappointing performance is the fault of the new currency, the euro. Most forecasters, especially those in Europe, predicted that the euro would rise smartly against the dollar and other currencies after its debut. Instead, it has slumped since its first week of trading. This decline erodes the year's gains on European stocks when they are translated into dollars.
For American investors, the euro's performance is a stark reminder that currency moves can still play a major role in the value of an international portfolio, despite assurances that the new euro, by combining 11 currencies, would make investing in Europe less complicated.
"Currency can really make a difference," lamented Joe Rooney, global strategist for Lehman Brothers Securities in London and one of many analysts who had expected the euro to rise in value. "What really caught us was the euro," he said. "We thought the good local stock returns would have been re-enforced" by a rally in the new currency.
In France, the CAC index of 40 stocks is up 5.9 percent in euro terms. But after accounting for the 7 percent fall in the value of the euro against the dollar, that gain reverses to a 1 percent decline. The 3.8 percent increase in Italy's Milan index of 30 stocks becomes a 3 percent decline in dollars. Ireland's overall index is up 8.2 percent in euros but only 1.1 percent in dollars. Only in Finland, where the main stock index has soared 14.8 percent, is the dollar return -- 7.3 percent -- a match for Wall Street's performance.
The euro has even undermined a remarkable turnaround in the German stock market. The DAX index of 30 stocks shot up 5.1 percent Friday on news of the resignation of Oskar Lafontaine, the German Finance Minister, who had alienated business leaders in part by calling for tax increases. That surge left the DAX up half a percentage point for the year in euros, back in the plus column after a sharp selloff from its January high. But American investors are still in the red in Germany, by 6.1 percent.
The revival of the dollar has also hurt Americans investing elsewhere, although that rebound was better anticipated. The dollar is now up 4.5 percent against the yen this year and has cut sharply into one of the better recent performances of the Japanese stock market. The Nikkei index of 225 stocks is up 11.9 percent in yen but 7.1 percent in dollars. (Given Japan's recent track record, American investors are probably not complaining.)
Mr. Rooney thinks the euro will rebound later this year, wiping out the currency losses and then amplifying gains that investors receive from the stock market. By the end of the year, Mr. Rooney is forecasting a 10 percent increase from current levels, to $1.20.
That would make a big difference for American investors. With the euro worth $1.20, the 1 percent decline in the French stock market in dollars so far this year would be transformed, for example, into an attractive 8.9 percent gain.
 BUT will Mr. Rooney prove to be correct? The euro rallied last week, rising three-quarters of a percent, to $1.0905. But its biggest daily gain -- an almost 1 percent jump on Thursday, when the German Finance Minister resigned -- evaporated on Friday.
Karen E. Parker, the currency strategist at Chase Securities, who predicted a fall in the new euro, still does not think it will rally this year, although Mr. Lafontaine's resignation may stem its near-term decline. She thinks an interest-rate cut to spur sluggish European growth is more likely, a move that would weaken the euro. And she is betting that the relatively stronger American economy will keep investors more interested in holding dollars than euros, leaving the new currency at about the same weakish level in 12 months that it is now.

HEADLINE: The ABC's of Spying

BYLINE: By Robert M. Gates; Robert M. Gates, a career intelligence officer, served on the National Security Council staff under four Presidents and was Director of Central Intelligence under President George Bush.

 BODY:
The current furor in Washington over Chinese espionage at Los Alamos offers fresh evidence that finger-pointing and sound bites are a lousy way to protect and advance American security interests. Too many officials, at both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue, are trying harder to make political hay or to protect themselves than to explain the larger lessons of China's actions and our own lax security. And too many commentators would rather egg on the antagonists for another good fight than shed light on the real issues at stake.
Is anyone really surprised that China spies on us, trying to steal military, economic, technological and intelligence secrets? Does anyone believe this is new? 
 Remember the case of Larry Wu-Tai Chin, the C.I.A. employee who was arrested in the mid-1980's for spying for China? He was hardly the only one. Russia also continues to spy on us, though many seemed surprised that a post-cold-war Russian intelligence service continued to run the Soviet spy Aldrich Ames as a mole in the C.I.A. Yet our broader relationship with both countries has continued nonetheless.
And it's not just old adversaries who spy on the United States. How about Israel paying Jonathan Pollard for thousands of pages of sensitive American intelligence documents? Or the French intelligence services stealing American business secrets by planting moles in American companies and bugging the hotel rooms of visiting American businessmen? Or the 20 or so other foreign governments that spy on American businesses?
The point of this is not to excuse China's espionage on the ground that everyone does it, but to highlight a reality that both the Clinton Administration and its critics neglect: despite the bonhomie of countless summit meetings and press statements, the post-cold-war world is a very tough neighborhood in which nations still cynically and ruthlessly pursue their own interests.
Governments modernize and enlarge their military forces, they spy, they sell technology for weapons of mass destruction, they lie and they cheat in order to amass power and wealth. (Nor are our own intelligence services idle in promoting American interests and protecting us from others.)
We should draw three lessons from this reality.
First, in a tough world -- the only world there has ever been, really -- we must recognize the critical and enduring importance of American strength and enhance that strength in all its dimensions: military, intelligence and diplomatic. Nor can we let our vigilance slacken. And that includes protecting secrets that matter, like nuclear weapons technology.
Second, our leaders need to help Americans understand that today we will find most nations to be both our partners and our adversaries -- sometimes simultaneously. Pigeonholing most countries in one or the other category -- as either friend or foe -- is wrongheaded and undermines our national interest.
This is not realpolitik; it is just plain common sense. The challenge, as always, is how to encourage behavior that advances our interests (and values) and to discourage behavior that does not -- and to do both these things in a manner that promotes long-term constructive relations with other world powers.
Third, too many foreign policy experts, especially in the current Administration, have often tried to play down or put the best face on troubling actions by Russia, China, North Korea and others. This does a disservice to the public's understanding of what is going on, and thus to our ability to act in response.
For instance, when officials fail to address candidly the pervasive corruption in the Russian Government (and the theft of billions in Western aid) as well as Moscow's aid to Iran's missile program and Russian obstructionism in the former Yugoslavia, this makes it harder for them to justify attempts to build closer ties with Russia.
Similarly, the failure to acknowledge China's misbehavior -- its role in the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, its theft of technology, its aggressive espionage against us, its repression of internal dissent -- undermines our Government's efforts to foster a stable, mutually beneficial relationship with China.
Such relationships are complicated. Washington -- and the media -- should stop underestimating Americans' ability to understand this if given the full story.
The more Americans know about both friendly and unfriendly behavior by powers like Russia and China, the better they will understand a mix of policies that together protect and advance our interests.
That imposes a burden on both the Administration and Congress to be forthright and honest about what they know: the good, the bad and the ugly. It is a burden that neither, so far, has effectively shouldered.
The result is tepid support for protecting our interests abroad -- or, worse, public indifference. When American leaders fail to speak forthrightly about the dangers that confront us, many citizens simply turn their backs on a complicated and confusing world.

HEADLINE: Mr. Bruno's Excellent Idea

 BODY:
It is not often that the major social welfare agencies in New York line up to support a proposal advanced by Joseph Bruno, the upstate Republican who is majority leader of the State Senate. It happened last week when Mr. Bruno, previously an advocate of cutbacks in welfare and health care for the poor, proposed a tax break for low-income workers. It would be paid for by savings that have resulted from the drop in welfare rolls. The idea makes particular sense because it would reward, among others, precisely those people who managed to get low-paying jobs after being on welfare.
Mr. Bruno's proposal would let working people who earn less than $30,000 keep more of their earnings. Even more attractive, it would give a cash refund to working families making less than $14,000, who pay no income tax at all. This payment, known as the earned-income tax credit, was a centerpiece of President Clinton's tax initiative of 1993. It has turned out to be one of the most successful anti-poverty programs of recent years. 
 The particular attraction of the credit, which would cost $160 million a year to finance, is that much of it would be paid for with Federal funds. Under the welfare reform act, Congress converted its matching payments to the state into a block grant that has kept level since 1997. The decline in welfare rolls means that $500 million in Federal matching funds have not been spent, a sum expected to rise to $1.4 billion in a year. Under Federal rules, this money can be spent only to help the poor through day-care, drug-assistance or other programs designed to help them hold down jobs. In suggesting that some of the money go for a tax credit to supplement the income of the working poor, Mr. Bruno is adopting an approach already being pursued by about a dozen states.
New York has been slow to spend all the surplus money available under welfare reform, in part because of a desire to save some in case there is a recession and the welfare rolls expand again. But using as much money as possible for a tax credit will create a bigger incentive for people to get off the rolls. That is important, because with each passing year Federal law requires larger percentages of people on welfare to find work.

Hail to the Chief and Pass the Word Processor

BYLINE: By GAIL COLLINS 

 BODY:
George Stephanopoulos seems to feel bad, in retrospect, that he did not press Bill Clinton harder about what went on with Gennifer Flowers before jumping to his candidate's defense. "I needed Clinton to see me as his defender, not his interrogator, which made me, of course, an enabler," he writes in his new memoir, "All Too Human." Ambivalence and regret are the two main emotional chords in the book, but in this case Mr. Stephanopoulos seems to be beating himself up unnecessarily. Throughout American history, when a bimbo eruption has hit an American Presidential campaign, the last thing a candidates' aides have considered doing is asking the Big Guy for the real story. When Grover Cleveland was accused of having an illegitimate child, he ordered his advisers to "tell the truth" and went off to sulk for the rest of the campaign. Nobody ran after him to ask exactly what the truth was supposed to be.
Mr. Stephanopoulos's treatment of the Clintons seems pretty evenhanded, even though, like almost everyone connected to the Clintons who did not leave the Administration under indictment, he left clutching a prescription for anti-depressants. "All Too Human" is not the sort of book that is going to make the younger generation yearn for a career as White House communications director. 
 The concept of the insider's tell-all has many critics, who believe that a President cannot be effective if he feels he is surrounded by a roomful of future memoirists. "It's like trying to govern on national TV," says Jody Powell, the Carter Administration press secretary. The Clinton White House would, of course, be a happier place today if the President had always conducted himself as if there were a film crew in the room. Besides, by the time Mr. Stephanopoulos got around to publishing, the President and his wife had been trashed by so many books, depositions and Congressional proceedings that it is hard to imagine what secret he could have disclosed that would have made any additional impact.
White House insider memoirs are almost always less damaging than anticipated because the people who write them are almost always people who want to be taken seriously, and they tend to write serious books. A Secretary of Defense pouring his heart out to a computer generally errs on the side of telling too little. The employee you really have to worry about is the one with no delusions of grandeur -- if Presidents are going to indulge in self-censorship, they should probably start with the dog walker and backstairs maids.
Over the last 15 years, White House aides have become authors with the same regularity that defeated Congressmen turn into lobbyists. While Mr. Stephanopoulos's $2.8 million advance raised some eyebrows, it was not as much, adjusting for inflation, as David Stockman, Ronald Reagan's former budget director, got for "The Triumph of Politics." The tome Mr. Stockman produced turned out to be tabloid fodder only for the Congressional Quarterly crowd. Mr. Stockman's biggest revelation was that President Reagan was not very interested in the budget process. It differed from the memoirs that followed only in that Mr. Stockman did not blame Nancy Reagan for the Federal deficit.
Ronald Reagan and Bill Clinton could not be less alike, and it is interesting that the two of them seem to have inspired a similar eagerness on the part of their top appointees to start typing as soon as they were out the door. The reason may simply be that these Presidents stayed in office longest, outlasting their ex-aides' patience.
But they also managed, in very different ways, to leave their former associates feeling betrayed. Mr. Clinton promised one thing, then did another. Mr. Reagan was a man whose charm was equaled by his disassociation from the people around him. Aides who had labored on his behalf for years sometimes came to realize that he barely knew their names, let alone what they had done. (That emotional distance was painfully apparent long before Mr. Reagan showed symptoms of Alzheimer's disease, and was possibly the reason his Administration boasts a list of tell-all authors that includes the President's own offspring.)
The most successful insider memoirist in recent Presidential history -- unless we are counting Barbara Bush's spaniel -- may have been the former Reagan chief of staff Donald Regan, who revealed the seminal role Mrs. Reagan's astrologer was playing in White House planning. Mr. Regan had been dumped rather unceremoniously from his job, unlike any of the Clinton-era memoirists thus far -- unless we are counting Monica Lewinsky. The publishers apparently did not know about the astrologer story when they signed Mr. Regan up, but they were banking on what they had sensed of his mood. There was, Mr. Regan's editor noted, a "vendetta quality" about their new author that seemed promising.

HEADLINE: China, Without Illusions

 BODY:
For all the twists and turns in his China policy over the last six years, President Clinton has never managed to take the full measure of this complex nation as it struggles to find its place in the world order. Mr. Clinton is not alone. China's intentions are hard to divine and even its leaders and people cannot be certain what economic, political and military role they will play in the years ahead. But Mr. Clinton and his national security team can be faulted for too often gliding over acts of Chinese belligerence in their determination to improve relations and strengthen commercial ties.
As the incidents have accumulated -- among them China's apparent efforts to influence the 1996 American election, its recent crackdown on dissent and its longstanding efforts to steal the most sensitive American military secrets -- the Clinton Administration has sometimes responded weakly. On occasion, it has even abetted Chinese behavior, as in its shortsighted 1996 decision to make it easier for China and other countries to acquire American communications satellites that have potential military applications. When the Administration has firmly defended American interests, as it did earlier in 1996 when China threatened Taiwan, it has nonetheless failed to address the broader pattern of aggressive Chinese conduct. 
 This has created a troubling impression that Washington's policy is running on automatic pilot, pointed toward the predetermined goal of engagement with China without any serious consideration of course corrections, much less a change in overall direction. The picture makes an inviting target for Republicans, who are now doing their best to turn China into the first foreign policy issue of the 2000 campaign. Some Republican critics, like Senator Richard Lugar, make a reasonable case that the White House ought to reassess its approach. Others, like the Presidential aspirants Pat Buchanan and Steve Forbes, are grandstanding.
With a visit to Washington by China's Prime Minister, Zhu Rongji, only a month away, a thoughtful review of China policy is needed, along with a recognition by the White House that the defense of American security interests must be paramount in dealing with Beijing. The guiding aim in relations should be that Washington deal with China warily, but not antagonistically.
The United States has good reasons to seek better understanding and cooperation with China, which is a nuclear power, a veto-wielding member of the United Nations Security Council, one of the world's largest economies and home to more than one-fifth of the earth's population. But engagement should not be viewed as an end in itself. It makes sense only as a way to advance American interests. These include encouraging greater political and economic freedom in China and persuading Beijing to play a responsible role in international affairs. These aims were advanced when Mr. Clinton spoke eloquently about human rights during his visit to China last year. They were enhanced when Washington won China's agreement to the nuclear test ban treaty and the chemical weapons convention and persuaded Beijing to restrict missile and nuclear-technology sales to Pakistan and Iran.
But too often these goals have been undermined by Washington. American policies were poorly served when the White House responded belatedly and anemically to questionable campaign contributions in 1996 that appear to have originated in China, and may have been directed by Chinese intelligence and military officials. Until recent changes forced by Congress, the handling of satellite sales dangerously relaxed export controls on advanced technology. American security was directly threatened when the Energy Department, the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the White House moved lethargically to deal with suspicions that a spy for China had obtained advanced nuclear warhead designs from the Los Alamos National Laboratory.
It may be that problems with China can be managed through a more exacting form of engagement that places less emphasis on commerce. It is abundantly clear that doing so will require more vigilance about protecting American interests and a greater willingness by the White House to resist Chinese efforts to exploit the relationship.

HEADLINE: New Status For Berlin, Everywhere But the Air

BYLINE: By ROGER COHEN 

DATELINE: BERLIN

 BODY:
Early this year, Mayor Eberhard Diepgen of Berlin slipped off to Chicago to try to resolve an increasingly desperate problem: the city presenting itself as "the new capital of Europe" does not have a single direct flight to or from the United States.
Berlin, of course, has history, intense and tormented. It has bracing air, said to be unusually healthy. It has a certain raw beauty that has nothing to do with harmony and something to do with the fascination of fracture. It is about to become home, once again, to the German Government. 
 But can the new capital of Europe's most powerful state be taken seriously when its only direct intercontinental flights are weekly services to two cities: Havana and Ulaan Baatar, Mongolia?
"The situation has become extremely embarrassing for the image of Berlin," said Dr. Volker Hassemer, the chief executive of Berlin Partner, a company trying to promote business in this city. "But these days the German airline, Lufthansa, only thinks in terms of profit."
Communist in its eastern half for more than 40 years and almost completely subsidized in its island-like western half, Berlin remains a city where the whiff of money-making is scarcely overpowering. And Lufthansa is simply unconvinced that it can turn a profit flying to New York from Berlin.
Hence Mayor Diepgen's mission to Chicago, where he met in January with Rono Dutta, the senior vice president for planning at United Airlines. The Mayor's inquiry was: would United fly to the new German capital from Chicago or New York or anywhere at all in the United States?
Mr. Diepgen, a Christian Democrat, came away convinced he had put Berlin on the map. In a statement from his office, he said the question was not if United would start direct flights to Berlin but when.
Michael-Andreas Butz, the Mayor's spokesman, said, "With all the diplomats and federal Government and parliamentary people about to come to Berlin, United is looking at a startup in the spring of 2000."
But United Airlines, which already has direct services to Frankfurt, Munich and Dusseldorf, appears to have taken a rather different view. Berlin, said Andrew Plews, a spokesman, remains "a maybe, and a rather long-term maybe."
Berlin's problem, as in so many things, is its history. Before Hitler started the war that brought the city down around him, and before Yalta isolated it in a divided Europe, many of the biggest German industries were here.
But the major insurance companies and big banks and industrial groups like Siemens all moved to Munich, Hamburg, Dusseldorf and elsewhere -- and very few of them show any sign of coming back.
Indeed, it is a paradox of the transfer of the German capital from Bonn to Berlin that business is thriving in Bonn -- office space vacancy is running at just 1.5 percent -- while it is still largely stagnant in the relatively isolated city of Berlin, where 18 percent of office space is vacant.
"Berlin was a kept person for 50 years," said Bernhard Schlink, the novelist, who is a longtime resident. "The people who came here were those who wanted to avoid the draft or the laws of economic competition. And now we find it is hard to live on our own again."
Where there is not a lot of business, of course, there are not a lot of business-class passengers. And that is why Delta Air Lines made the apparently curious decision to close down the one nonstop flight from Berlin to New York last year.
"It just did not make financial sense," said Horst Zsifkovits, the manager of the Delta office in Berlin. "The problem is not the quantity of travelers, it's the fact that your business-class cabin is often empty. Delta is not interested in money-losing propositions."
Nor, it seems, is Lufthansa, which started a nonstop service from New York to Berlin with great fanfare in 1990, but quickly shut it down when it realized "that the city really had gone to sleep in economic terms over those many years with the wall," said Wolfgang Weber, a spokesman.
Lufthansa appears to have little interest in draining passengers from its important hubs in Frankfurt and Munich. Moreover, because Berlin was long divided, it has three airports -- Tegel, Tempelhof and Schonefeld -- which would make it difficult to have a hub for connecting flights to Central and Eastern Europe.
Mr. Butz, the Mayor's spokesman, said the city planned to spend about $3.3 billion to turn Schonefeld, the airport for the former East Berlin, into "one of the most modern airports in the world by 2007." But airlines are skeptical.
So Berlin seems set to continue in its odd limbo. But then the city's strangeness is perhaps part of its appeal. It is not, after all, every European capital that offers nonstop service to Mongolia.

HEADLINE: Security Council Relegated to Sidelines

BYLINE: By JUDITH MILLER 

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, March 12

 BODY:
In a world with conflicts raging from Angola to Kosovo, the United Nations Security Council, the heart of the world body, finds itself increasingly marginalized.
The causes, diplomats say, are many, but among the most important is America's growing impatience with the Council's often laborious decision-making process and Washington's increasing resort to regional groups to stop or prevent increasingly local conflicts. 
 A result, many agree, has been the United Nations' growing irrelevance to many major conflicts.
"Where is the Security Council on Kosovo?" said Herbert S. Okun, a former American Ambassador and an adviser to the United Nations on international drug issues. "Or Ethiopia? Or even Iraq?"
Nabil A. Elaraby, who is leaving his post as Egypt's representative and who has served on the Security Council, called the Council's record in the last five years "nothing to be proud of" and "lamentable" of late.
"The Security Council is doing more and more things," said David Malone, a former Canadian diplomat at the United Nations and president of the International Peace Academy, a research organization that studies it. "But the things it is doing seem to matter less and less."
In Kosovo, the Security Council has been sidelined as NATO has essentially taken over management of the conflict and efforts to find a solution. Any peacekeeping operation there would be run by NATO, as well as any decision to use force. Although some European nations want the Security Council to have a say, it has been cut out of any such role, primarily by the United States.
In Iraq, the United Nations regime intended to monitor Iraq's weapons program has been stymied by Baghdad's refusal to cooperate. With Russia, France and China increasingly hostile to economic sanctions against Baghdad or the use of force, the United States and Britain have been pursuing policies independent of the Council, conducting nearly daily bombing raids over Iraq. Meanwhile, three recently formed United Nations panels are trying to find a solution to the impasse.
In other places as well, United Nations efforts have been thwarted, rebuffed or ignored. The number of United Nations peacekeepers in the field has dropped from 80,000 a decade ago to 17,000 today. Last month, China pulled the plug on a peacekeeping force for Macedonia, which has helped keep chaos in the Balkans from spreading since 1993.
Security Council members, faced with opposition from Angola to a United Nations presence, recently voted to end their peacekeeping mission there. And on the Horn of Africa, the Security Council has proved powerless to persuade Ethiopia and Eritrea to settle their border dispute peacefully, leaving mediation largely to the regional Organization of African Unity.
Clinton Administration officials and others have in recent months blamed Secretary General Kofi Annan, who has been at odds with the Administration over its policy toward Iraq, for the malaise.
To help ease tensions, Mr. Annan traveled to Washington in February to smooth relations and try to persuade Congress to pay more than a billion dollars in past dues. The trip was a personal success for Mr. Annan, diplomats agreed. But it failed to address what many call the underlying causes of the deep divisions that have disabled the Security Council.
Those divisions and the resulting paralysis, they say, reflect underlying political shifts that may be difficult for any secretary general, or the United Nations, to address.
Among them, analysts say, is Russia's decline as a world power and its determination to prove that it is a still a force to be reckoned with by vetoing, or threatening to veto, many American-backed proposals in the Security Council.
But Boutros Boutros-Ghali, Mr. Annan's predecessor, who was barred from a second term by Clinton Administration opposition, blames the United States for sidelining the Security Council on key issues.
In a rare interview since his departure, Mr. Boutros-Ghali said the problem was that growing opposition to American policy within the Security Council had more and more often divided its five permanent members -- the United States, Russia, Britain, France, and China.
"The marginalization began in 1993 with the Somalia intervention and the subsequent change of majority in Congress," Mr. Boutros-Ghali said, referring to the killing of American soldiers in the failed peacekeeping mission in Somalia and the later victory of what he called Republican "isolationists" in the House and Senate.
It increased, he said, with "America's discovery of its role as the sole remaining superpower." He added: "Weaker states depend heavily on diplomacy. When you're powerful, you don't need it."
Sir Jeremy Greenstock, Britain's representative to the United Nations, said that the Security Council's paralysis on key issues reflected what he called a "change of culture" since the end of the cold war.
Ethnic conflicts within states are now at least as common as interstate disputes, he said, but harder for the Security Council to address. "Political identity is shrinking when it should be expanding," he said, and "nations increasingly pursue their own, rather than the collective, interest."
Sir Jeremy, whose country has most often and most staunchly supported Washington, refused to blame any one state for the Council's malaise. But, he continued, it is "shortsighted" of the Administration to ignore or sidestep the Security Council, even if it does take time and effort to secure a consensus there.
Mr. Elaraby, Egypt's representative, echoing a growing resentment of what several diplomats called American "bullying" at the United Nations, said, "Of the five permanent members, there is increasingly only one."
Administration officials rejected such complaints, noting, for example, that the Security Council had by most standard legal interpretations authorized the bombing and use of force against Iraq. Moreover Washington, one official added, has spent "hours and hours" consulting with Russian officials, trying to head off confrontations where possible and secure at least implicit acceptance of American policy in conflicts ranging from Iraq to Kosovo.
"We go out of our way to consult with Russia," a senior Administration official said. "But on some key issues, as the United Nations Charter clearly allows, we must protect our national interests."
But increasingly, one diplomat said on the condition of anonymity, Washington uses the Council "selectively," to find multilateral cover for its policies, relying on regional organizations instead to legitimize force when a Russian or Chinese veto seems likely.
In a recent interview, Secretary General Annan said that it was "natural" for NATO to handle the Kosovo crisis, since the "United Nations Charter urges regional organizations" to deal with such conflicts. "It's not marginalizing the United Nations," Mr. Annan said.
Yet, he said, he hopes the United States will consult with the Security Council if efforts to negotiate a peaceful solution to the crisis fail and military force is to be used. Mr. Annan disagrees with American policy on Iraq, which he says "goes far beyond Security Council resolutions" by which he is bound.
Leslie Gelb, president of the Council on Foreign Relations and a former columnist for The New York Times, said that the Administration, unable to persuade fellow Council members of the wisdom of its policy toward Iraq, has made Mr. Annan and its United Nations "convenient whipping boys" for "confused policy." The Administration's policy calls for removing Saddam Hussein whether or not he accepts weapons inspectors back into the country.
"The problem is not Kofi Annan, the most pro-Western and pro-American Secretary General Washington has had, or is likely to have," Mr. Gelb said. "And it's not an unyielding Security Council. Sure, on some issues, Russia and China won't budge. But usually when the United States has a clear, convincing policy, it gets its way on the Council. Maybe our policy is neither anymore."
Several diplomats expressed confidence that the Security Council would eventually return to center stage, if only because there is no real alternative to the legitimation that its decisions provide. Mr. Annan, for one, argued that the limitations of relying on regional groups instead to sanction the use of force were already becoming apparent.
"I don't see, say, NATO being used to solve security problems outside Europe," Mr. Annan said, referring to the cool reception that NATO members gave an American proposal to involve it in antidrug and antiterrorism work. "Ultimately, I'm sure everyone will decide it is wiser to press for and work within a harmonious Council."

HEADLINE: U.S. General Recommends Pullout From Haiti

BYLINE: By STEVEN A. HOLMES 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 13

 BODY:
The commander of United States forces in Latin America and the Caribbean has recommended the withdrawal of American troops from Haiti, saying the country's increasing political turbulence is placing them in danger.
In closed-door testimony last month to a defense subcommittee of the House Appropriations Committee, Gen. Charles E. Wilhelm, head of the Southern Command, said that the deployment of 500 American troops should be "terminated" and replaced by periodic visits by United States military personnel. 
 General Wilhelm's comments were reported today in The Washington Post. A senior aide to the general, who confirmed the report, said that should the Clinton Administration decide to continue the American presence in Haiti, General Wilhelm would follow orders to the best of his ability.
The general "was asked his opinion from a military standpoint and he gave his opinion," said Col. Vince Ogilvie, head of public affairs for the Southern Command. Colonel Ogilvie said that General Wilhelm did not in any way "try to give the impression that he cannot or will not comply with the orders that he is given."
The Haiti mission began in 1994 when 20,000 American troops invaded the island to restore the democratically elected Government of President Jean-Bertrand Aristide to power.
Mr. Aristide, a popular Roman Catholic priest, had been overthrown by the country's military leaders in 1991.
Having placed Mr. Aristide back in power, American troops gradually dwindled in number to the present force of about 500, who are involved in tasks like digging wells, providing medical services and training police and military officers.
While the Administration had hoped that the Governments of Mr. Aristide and his successor, Rene Preval, would lead to stability in Haiti, the Western Hemisphere's poorest country, that has not been the case. Mr. Preval last month dissolved Parliament and has been ruling by decree.
Economic conditions have yet to markedly improve, and Haitian refugees have once again begun undertaking the risky journey in leaky boats to Florida.
General Wilhelm reportedly told the subcommittee that given the country's deteriorating economic and political climate, he thought that his troops would be placed at risk.
The Administration evaluates the Haiti mission periodically. "We constantly review our troop presence in Haiti," David Leavy, spokesman for the National Security Council, said today. "The President is committed to reduce and eventually withdraw our forces there. We have not made any final decisions and we continue to be committed to Haiti's democratic transition."

HEADLINE: Experts Concerned About Return Of Deadly Bacteria in Cold Cuts

BYLINE: By MARIAN BURROS 

 BODY:
Contamination of hot dogs and cold cuts by a sometimes deadly bacterium -- one that is little known by the public -- has led to an extraordinary series of recalls in recent months, as well as increased Government action to detect the problem sooner and prevent it.
There had been few reports of contamination by the bacterium, Listeria monocytogenes, over the last six years. But it resurfaced in December, when 35 million pounds of hot dogs and processed luncheon meats were recalled following an outbreak of listeriosis. Nearly 100 people in 22 states became ill, and 20 deaths were reported. 
 Already this year, the Department of Agriculture has announced eight recalls because of listeria, seven of processed meats and one of milk. By comparison, the December recall was one of only three announced by the Federal agency in 1998, and two were announced in 1997.
Although no deaths have been linked to the recalls so far in 1999, the December outbreak "shook everyone up," said Dr. I. Kay Wachsmuth, deputy administrator for the office of public health and science in the Department of Agriculture's Food Safety and Inspection Service.
But no one is quite sure what to make of it. "We can't tell at this point if there is a resurgence," Dr. Wachsmuth said.
Listeria does not pose much danger to most people. But it is a serious threat to the elderly, to pregnant women, to fetuses and newborns, and to those whose immune systems are compromised.
Foodborne bacteria like salmonella, E. coli and listeria are common in raw food, but cooking kills them. Scientists do not understand how listeria got into the processed foods that have been recently recalled. Testing techniques vary even among Government agencies, and scientists do not know what level of bacteria is harmful.
Since the outbreak in December -- which was linked to products made by Bil Mar Foods, a subsidiary of Sara Lee -- the Agriculture Department has been searching for reasons listeria has surfaced again. The agency has begun to focus on the long shelf lives of these ready-to-eat products as a culprit. Shelf life -- the length of time after manufacture that a food can safely be sold -- has increased considerably in the last 10 years because of better plant sanitation. But unlike many other disease-causing bacteria, listeria does grow at refrigerator and freezer temperatures.
Some recent changes designed to track and control listeria are already in place. Others are under study:
*A new DNA test has been adopted that allows the Federal Government to quickly link cases across the country to a single source of contamination.
*Federal and state agencies are working to improve coordination so that information can be transmitted more efficiently.
*Food processors must now hold more product, and for a longer time, if a sample tests positive for listeria, to prevent the distribution of potentially contaminated foods.
*Regulators are considering making microbial testing mandatory, and requiring warning labels on franks and cold cuts. They are also weighing a consumer education campaign to warn those at greatest risk.
*Processors are examining new techniques for sanitizing their facilities. Failures in sanitation may be at the heart of the outbreaks.
 
Shortage of Data Challenges Officials
But underneath this flurry of activity a basic problem remains: lack of sound scientific data.
"Listeria is a major challenge," said Dr. Michael Osterholm, the former State Epidemiologist at the Minnesota Health Department. "Manufacturers and consumers are left not knowing" what the infectious dose is, whether one strain is more virulent than others and whether current microbial testing techniques are sensitive enough to find the bacteria at very low levels.
Listeria is widespread in the natural world, lurking in many species of animals, including household pets, as well as ticks, soil, dust, streams and a wide variety of foods. Healthy people are usually not affected, or at worst, suffer a throat or intestinal infection with mild flu-like symptoms. But full-blown listeriosis may cause meningitis and encephalitis among vulnerable groups.
The population that is at risk is growing, as the number of elderly increases along with the numbers of people with weakened immune systems like cancer and transplant patients and people with AIDS. Pregnant women are especially vulnerable, as are their unborn children; even a mild infection may result in miscarriage, stillbirth or life-threatening illness for a newborn.
Health officials are particularly concerned because the percentage of people who die from listeria is apparently much higher than it is from better-known but less lethal food borne bacteria like salmonella, campylobacter and E. coli 0157:H7. In addition, the incubation period is much longer. Symptoms of listeriosis can take up to 70 days to appear.
Listeriosis can be treated successfully with antibiotics, but even with drug treatment, the mortality rate is about 30 percent. Of the 20 deaths linked to the Bil Mar outbreak, 6 were miscarriages or stillbirths and most of the adults were over 60.
Until December, there was good reason to think that listeria was under control. The last outbreak of listeriosis occurred in 1994. Epidemiologists differentiate between outbreaks, when multiple illnesses can be attributed to a single source, and individual cases with no known links.
 
Campaigns Since 1985 To Overcome a Germ
That followed years of efforts by food processors and the Government to eliminate the problem. Scientists began to focus on listeria in 1985, after an outbreak traced to Jalisco brand soft cheese caused 142 cases of listeriosis and more than 40 deaths. Food processors took steps to improve sanitation in their factories.
At the same time, the Agriculture Department adopted a tougher policy for listeria levels in processed meats: automatic recall if any listeria is found. Between 1989 and 1993 there was a 44 percent reduction in the cases of listeriosis. The incidence has remained constant since then, at about 1,100 cases a year.
No one is certain if the growing number of recalls since the Bil Mar outbreak is the result of an actual increase in listeria contamination, increased public awareness, or additional government surveillance and the introduction of a new surveillance system called Foodnet and a sophisticated detection system called Pulsenet.
Because of a recent increase in financing for food safety, the Government has set up eight sites around the country for active surveillance of foodborne diseases. They make weekly reports to the Federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which can immediately alert health officials in all 50 states. In the past it often took weeks, sometimes months, for the C.D.C. to learn about problems.
Federal officials are also trying to improve their links between one another and with state officials. A food safety task force, called the Foodborne Outbreak Response Coordinating Group, was set up two years ago to deal with emergencies and was used in the large outbreak of salmonella in cereal in 1998. Notification is now made electronically. "We are getting better," said Dr. Wachsmuth of the Agriculture Department.
Pulsenet, activated in 1998, allows scientists to fingerprint the DNA of bacteria. Dr. Wachsmuth said that without Pulsenet, the listeria outbreak in December might never have been linked to Bil Mar products.
 
Over 3,000 Tests Performed Every Year
Each year the agency performs about 3,500 microbial tests for listeria in meat-processing plants. Once there has been an outbreak, the number of tests increases.
Beyond the routine tests, some of the recalls have been the result of microbial testing by distributors and by the agency's compliance officers responding to consumer complaints. "Lots of folks hear there are lots of recalls, and it makes them nervous and we catch more," Dr. Wachsmuth said.
New rules on food samples that test positive for listeria have been in place since August and may have played a role in the higher-than-usual number of recalls. Processors are now required to hold the entire day's output from the production line where a positive sample was found. Previously the plant was required to hold only the production from two hours on either side of the positive sample.
The manufacturers, too, are trying to take corrective action. They are changing the flooring for better drainage, looking at the locations of the air-conditioning unit, separating raw production from processed products and scrutinizing the methods they use for cleaning. "Eradication of listeria from the environment that could contaminate food might not be impossible," Dr. Wachsmuth said. "But I'm not aware of any silver bullet. They just have to do these sanitary operation procedures more rigorously, and you couple that with environmental testing to make sure you've eliminated the listeria."
The Agriculture Department is considering mandatory microbial testing of ready-to-eat products, a move vigorously opposed by the industry. Some plants already test the environment. If listeria is discovered, then products are sometimes tested, but those in the industry would rather not discuss specifics.
 
Fears of Liability Discourage Some Tests
An industry spokeswoman explained that most plants do not test for listeria because of the Agriculture Department's zero tolerance level for the bacteria.
"The Federal Government is standing in the way of doing testing," said Jenny Scott, the senior food safety program director of the National Food Processors Association. "The problem is the zero tolerance policy for listeria in ready-to-eat products. Because you can't have any listeria in a product, there is a potential legal and regulatory liability if you test the product and find listeria."
The Center for Science in the Public Interest, a public health advocacy group in Washington, has asked the Agriculture Department to require testing of hot dogs, cold cuts, luncheon meats and other fully cooked meat and poultry products. "Right now the industry is fighting mandatory testing for economic, not scientific reasons," said Caroline Smith DeWaal, the director of food safety for the center. "The industry is liable if anyone gets sick regardless of whether they test or not. Testing would add an additional layer of protection."
There is also no consensus on what the tolerance level should be, because of a lack of data. No one knows what an infectious dose of listeria is, Dr. Wachsmuth said.
Dr. Bala Swaminathan, chief of the foodborne and diarrheal diseases laboratory section of the C.D.C, said: "For foods that are not to be cooked, I'm in favor of zero tolerance until we have a better idea of the infectious dose and I think microbial testing should be done. We will never be able to define a single infectious dose for everyone."
 
A Need Cited For Changes in Methods
The Agriculture Department has also been looking very closely at the shelf life of ready-to-eat foods. As listeria levels in processed meats dropped because of increased sanitation, between 1989 and 1993, processors lengthened the sell-by and use-by dates on their products. Long shelf life may provide the opportunity for listeria to grow and reach levels that cause listeriosis, and some testing methods are not sensitive enough to detect very low levels of listeria.
"Regulatory testing misses about 25 percent of what might be there," said Dr. Catherine Donnelly, professor of nutrition and food science and a food microbiologist at the University of Vermont. Dr. Donnelly said that a newer test she uses has a 98 percent success rate. The U.S.D.A. is looking at new testing methods.
Suggestions have also been made about the importance of notifying high-risk consumers with warning labels on ready-to-eat products and an education campaign. While food processors generally oppose warning labels, there is agreement that, as Janet Riley of the American Meat Institute said, the public doesnot know much about listeria. "I don't think there is a strong awareness about risks," Ms. Riley said. "I was never provided with any of this information by my obstetrician."
 
Tips For Avoiding Listeriosis Infections
To protect against listeriosis, the Government advises consumers to thoroughly cook raw animal products; thoroughly wash all food that is to be eaten raw like fruits and vegetables; keep foods to be eaten raw separate from uncooked meats, and wash hands, knives and cutting boards with hot soapy water.
Those most vulnerable to listeriosis are advised also to:
Avoid all soft cheeses, including feta, Camembert, brie and blue-veined cheeses like Roquefort.
Cook hot dogs until the internal temperature reaches 165 degrees, either by steaming or frying. Cooking in a microwave oven is not recommended.
Avoid deli meats like salami, corned beef, bologna and liverwurst unless you are willing to cook them, for example in a hot corned beef sandwich.

HEADLINE: FAR FROM HOME, ALONE -- A special report.;
Young Immigrants Find a Hard New Land

BYLINE: By SOMINI SENGUPTA 

 BODY:
Monir was hardly among the huddled, hungry masses of Bangladesh when he arrived at Kennedy International Airport three years ago. His father was an engineer; everyone expected Monir would go to college and study accounting.
What drove him from home was neither poverty nor war, just the sure specter of a dead-end future. Back in Dhaka, all but the wealthiest toiled through college only to hunt in vain for decent jobs. At 15, Monir took flight, in search of an American education, another life. 
 Now 18 and still struggling through his sophomore year of high school, Monir works late every night, packing takeout orders of Thai food. The fear of failure follows him like a ghost. It is there when he cannot get to school on time, when he realizes how far behind he is on his homework, when he spots a classmate who dropped out a while back, handing out fliers for an Indian restaurant in the East Village.
"I have those worries," Monir confessed quietly. "Maybe I'll end up like him."
They are elusive to official institutions, but youngsters like Monir are everywhere. They deliver pizza on rickety bicycles. They cut flower stems at the corner greengrocer. They peddle fake-label watches on the sidewalks of Manhattan and sprint at the sight of the police.
Over the last several years, a small but growing number of teen-agers -- virtually all boys, some as young as 14 or 15 -- have arrived without their parents, much like the child immigrants of a century ago. Once here, they become New York's youngest immigrant workers, their cheap, nimble labor easily absorbed by the city's thriving service economy.
They come from countries where the poor go to work young. They know they are trading one hard life for another, but at least this one seems to come with options. Here, on their own, they are free, and yet they are trapped in an underground ruled in large measure by fear -- of the immigration authorities, child welfare agencies, smugglers, thugs and bosses, past and potential. (That is why all of the youngsters interviewed for this article would give only their first names; some refused to be photographed.)
And immigration scholars and social workers wonder if they will ever be able to break free. Most are in this country illegally -- and with rare exception, seem destined to remain so. Many come for education, and its promise of opportunity unimaginable in Dhaka, or whatever place they left behind. And yet, working long, hard hours to stay alive, they often find themselves too tired and tied down, and simply too poor, to get the education they need to move beyond the margins of the economy.
In short, they are like a lot of new immigrants. And yet they are not -- because they are children, and they are alone.
Just how many there are cannot be known, but the few institutions that encounter them offer piecemeal evidence of their growing presence. The Immigration and Naturalization Service reports a fivefold increase in the number of unaccompanied minors entering the country illegally over the last five years. In fiscal year 1998, the agency had 4,284 such children in detention, the vast majority between 15 and 18. Officials say they expect many more to come from parts of Central America ravaged by Hurricane Mitch.
At the Chinatown Health Center, doctors report seeing many more children coming alone, especially from Fujian province, over the last four years. English teachers at The Door, a SoHo youth center, say they have seen rising numbers of teen-agers coming alone from Mexico and Central America.
"It's really spiked, starting about three years ago," said Christopher Ambrose, the center's co-director. "It's just incredible to me that they're doing what they're doing all by themselves."
Among the ranks of teen-age immigrants to the city was a young man from Guinea named Amadou Diallo, whose American adventure began three years ago at age 19 and ended last month when, unarmed, he was killed by the police at the door to his apartment building in the Bronx. There are boys like Francisco, from Mexico, who run away defiantly, and those like Abdoulaye, from Senegal, who come with their parents' blessings. There are those like Monir who live on their own, perhaps with a roommate, and those who are taken in by relatives, like Jian, a Fujianese farmer's son, who shares a two-room tenement in Chinatown with an uncle and eight other men.
All are keenly, constantly aware of the gulf between them and the young people around them -- many of them also poor, many also immigrants, but none quite so peculiarly alone. Jian is struck by this every time he runs into schoolmates from Qianyang, his village outside the city of Fuzhou. If they work, it is not to pay the rent. Their parents take care of that, and harangue them to finish their homework so they do not have to work in sweatshops all their lives.
Once, Jian invited his old best friend over to his apartment, and his friend gasped. "He said, 'I can't imagine you live here,' " Jian recalls. "We are like strangers."
 
A Life of Work
Long Hours And Long Odds
Francisco's day begins in the blue light before dawn, as the steel accordion gates of a lower Manhattan diner roll open for business. Francisco's territory is the grill, where he hovers over burgers and B.L.T.'s. To his left sits a vat of gurgling hot oil that has pocked his arms with a trail of burns. A Yankees cap shields his boyish, blessedly acne-free face.
Except Sundays, when he makes sandwiches at another deli, this is Francisco's world all week, from 4:30 A.M. till 3:30 in the afternoon. After work, there are lessons at The Door, where he has learned English and is now, after nearly a decade without a formal education, preparing for the high school equivalency exam. Then, home by 8 to his room in a basement apartment near Yankee Stadium, so he can shower, sleep and rise by 3 A.M. for another day at the grill.
He is 21 now, but Francisco's childhood died young, in the Oaxacan village of Etla. By the time he was 10, he was hopping trains to faraway towns, where he passed himself off as an orphan and ran errands in exchange for food, spare change, a set of new clothes.
His parents tried to wring the restlessness out of him, but without success. With the help of a friend already living in the Bronx, he found a smuggler, who for $900 led him across the border and onto a plane to New York. Francisco thinks he was 15 then.
Within weeks, he was sweeping the floors of a midtown garment factory, 10 or 12 hours every day, for $190 a week.
Finding work was always a breeze, though the terms of his employment were completely illegal. Under state law, school is mandatory for all those under 17. And youths between ages 16 and 18 are barred from working more than 28 hours a week when school is in session.
Once, cutting a swatch of linen, Francisco accidentally sliced off a piece of his left index finger. His boss dropped him in front of a hospital emergency room and left. When Francisco returned to work, the boss refused to take him back, saying he was too young.
"They really took advantage of me, huh?" Francisco said, chuckling. "I learned that after I left that job."
In Francisco's fiercely self-protective world, there is little time or inclination to play. Fear keeps him on the straight and narrow. Sometimes, he hangs out with young Mexicans who live in his building, but he will not drink with them, for fear he will not make it to work on time. There are clubs he could go to, but he won't, for fear he will be swept up in a drunken brawl.
Perhaps what also keeps Francisco on his path of self-restraint is boys like Marcos. The two are strangers, but in a way, they are mirror images.
When Marcos left Oaxaca at age 12, he, too, was searching for money and education. Seven years later, he has not known a day of school, nor has he managed to learn English. He has been a dishwasher, a pizza deliverer and a prep cook. He has also been to Rikers Island and back.
Marcos has never really been out of trouble. At first, he was taunted in his East Harlem neighborhood as a "mojado," a wetback. Thugs repeatedly jumped him, taking what little money he made.
Soon, though, another band of thugs came to his rescue. They called themselves Los Vagos, the vagabonds, and they became his family. They tattooed a tricolor Virgin on his left arm; they made sure he was never attacked again.
But trouble continued to trail him. Within months, a knife fight at a soccer match got him six months in jail. And in December, one of Los Vagos was shot and killed at a club on 116th Street; Marcos said he and seven other gang members were charged. He is out on bail, awaiting trial.
"We say this is the lost generation," said Brother Joel Magallan, a Jesuit who works for the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New York as its liaison to Mexican immigrants. "I know a lot of parents who are trying to keep them in Mexico. They don't want their kids coming here."
Francisco may have run away at 15, but he never intended to stay away so long, he said. His goal was to earn enough money to establish a family business. Last year, he wired home $11,000 in savings so his father could set up a garment factory. He had read that clothing was one of Mexico's chief exports. Nowhere had he read about the hurdles.
"You have to have big capital," he says now. "You have to have connections."
The lessons came too late. The five sewing machines bought with his savings now collect dust in Etla.
 
Changing Opportunity
The Road Narrows For Immigrants
The stories of Francisco and the others are a distant echo of the flood of teen-age immigrants a century ago. Back then, at the crest of the last great wave of immigration, Italian boys landed by themselves at Ellis Island and went to work hawking newspapers or hauling produce. Girls from Russia came alone to work in garment factories.
But if their aspirations are in many ways the same, today's teen-age immigrants are landing on drastically changed shores.
Nancy Foner, an anthropologist who studies the city's immigration history, offered her own family's example. In 1905 or so, when he was 8 or 9, her grandfather came alone from Russia and joined a brother in Hartford. The sum of his American education was some time in night school as a working teen-ager, but by the time he retired, he was running a lucrative construction business in Queens.
Certainly, few immigrants of that era bounded up the economic ladder in one generation. Still, those with little schooling could find a factory job -- often, a dirty job for low pay, but a job for life. Some could move from unskilled factory jobs to semi-skilled labor at slightly better pay. Some could even open small shops or factories. And since, with few exceptions, even those without formal papers did not face the constant threat of deportation, even the immigrant who did not succeed economically could establish a firm, legal foothold for the next generation.
"It's much harder to get ahead today, with as little education as my grandfather had," Ms. Foner explained.
Today's teen-age immigrants, by contrast, are unlikely to be legal and have few ways to change that. Unlike adults with marketable skills, they are unlikely to be sponsored by an employer, and few have resident family members to help them obtain a green card. And their immigration status, compounded by poverty, makes it extremely difficult to get the higher education that is ever more crucial to economic success. For illegal immigrants, a secure job of any kind has become harder to find.
So, while some will find a way to get ahead, most seem likely to drift from way station to way station in New York's economic underground, hoping, at best, to save enough money to set up a decent life back home.
"My guess would be that if you do not have fluency in English, if you do not have skills, if you do not have legal papers, you're going to work in a marginal, shadow economy," said David Reimers, a historian at New York University. "I don't see these people, in their lifetime, improving that much."
Whether most will end up staying or returning home is anyone's guess. For now, out there on the margins, they tend to fall below the radar of government agencies that deal with children. Given the choices here and at home, some academics and advocates say, it is probably just as well.
"It's a pretty sad thing to say that perhaps the best outcome would be let them work, leave them alone," said Hector Cordero-Guzman, a sociologist at the New School for Social Research. "Increased enforcement might not mean better life chances for these kids."
 
The Education Barrier
Many Lack Tools To Get Ahead
If college is the dream, Jian would seem closer than most. Even so, he feels it slipping away.
The first in his family to learn his letters, he is 20 credits shy of a high school diploma. Eight hours a day, he is in class at Manhattan Comprehensive Night and Day School, a school for older teen-agers. Four years after leaving China at age 17, his time is running out. He can attend public school free only until the end of his 21st year; he has just turned 21.
Weekends are spent behind the Plexiglas of a Chinese takeout restaurant in New Jersey: 12-hour shifts both days, $70 a day. At first, his priorities puzzled his roommates. "They said: 'Why you want to study? You're not born here,' " he recalled.
Many young immigrants like him rarely venture outside Chinatown or learn English, he says. The prospect terrifies him. "You don't know English, you know how difficult life is," Jian said. "How about the future?"
For now, Jian pays $50 a month for a bed in a sixth-floor walk-up. The apartment is so cramped that he does morning sit-ups in bed, so noisy that he starts studying at the kitchen table only after everyone is asleep.
Jian says he has no regrets about coming here. And recently, he was granted a rare boon -- political asylum on the ground of religious persecution. He is a Christian, with the dangerous habit of preaching to his classmates back home. He can become an American citizen in a few years.
Still, even with the security of asylum, even with a diploma, he says he will have to postpone college until he can climb his mountain of debt: the $40,000 that his parents borrowed from family and from the bank to have him smuggled to America. So after high school, Jian plans to get a full-time restaurant job and start repaying the loans. He does not know anyone who has gone to college here. He says it probably costs too much. "I'm not sure," he concluded, "but I think it's a lot of money."
 
Longing for Home
Isolation Amid the Crowd
By the time Abdoulaye felt that adolescent urge to take flight from Senegal, nearly every house on his block in Kaolack had sent a young man abroad -- to France, Italy and, in recent years, to the United States. At 19, made restless by a long strike at his university, Abdoulaye joined the odyssey.
"The new generation -- you have to go out and discover," his father had told him before his death. "To be more lucky than us."
Abdoulaye knew America long before he got here. He knew the rhymes of Public Enemy and Tupac Shakur and the names of fashionable sneakers. He also knew how much money his compatriots had made here and taken back to Senegal.
Today, at 20, Abdoulaye is luckier than many of his peers. He lives with his uncles and their wives in the Bronx. He works at the family business, selling color televisions to fellow Africans. He just wasn't prepared for the loneliness.
In a palm-size photo album, he keeps snapshots of his friends back home. Abdoulaye misses their company terribly. On the subway, he listens to Youssou N'Dour on his headphones and writes to them, telling them the truth about this place they all once dreamed of. Recently, he wrote about attending his first American demonstration, in front of the house where Amadou Diallo died.
"You know, in my country, every time I walk the street, I was with one of my friends," he said. "Here, when I get out of school, I walk by myself. Nobody talks to me. I don't talk to nobody. I feel, 'Where I am? Where I am?' "
Monir calls home whenever he is blue, which is evidently often, considering he sometimes runs up a $200 phone bill. Often, the conversation turns to his future here, though, in typical immigrant fashion, he is less than candid about the fine points of his new life. "I don't really tell them how much I work," he confided.
For a year and a half, he has worked seven hours a night, six nights a week at the Thai restaurant. At the end of each shift, he pockets $45.
His mother still presses him to come home, but so far, his more pragmatic parent has prevailed. "My father says, 'What is he going to do here?' " Monir explained.
More and more, he asks that same question of himself.
"I think a lot about whether to stay," he said, "or whether to go back."

Owners Meet This Week Amid Yearning for Replay

BYLINE: By THOMAS GEORGE 

 BODY:
"It was a game against Miami back in the early 70's," recalled Ralph Wilson, 80, for 39 years owner of the Buffalo Bills, spinning a tale with dancing, colorful wit, wisdom and inflection that few can.
"Mercury Morris fumbled and one of our defensive ends fell on the ball," Wilson recalled. "In doing so, the officials ruled he pushed one of their crew and slapped us with a 15-yard penalty and gave the ball back to the Dolphins. We were getting back into the game and that killed us. Miami went on to score and win. I didn't like it. I said so afterward. 
 "I got 10 G's for that one."
It was Pete Rozelle, then commissioner of the National Football League, who fined Wilson $10,000 for disparaging remarks about N.F.L. officials.
Last season, for only the second time in his nearly four decades of pro football, Wilson was fined again, this time by Paul Tagliabue, the current commissioner.
It was in a late November game, Buffalo at New England, and as the final seconds ticked away, on New England's desperation pass into the end zone, Buffalo was called for pass interference. There was pushing and shoving aplenty by players for both teams on the play, and usually no penalty is called in that situation. This time, it was. New England was awarded the ball near the goal line, scored a touchdown and won, 25-21.
Afterward, Wilson said things like, "We got robbed!" and "It's awful!" and "That was a jump ball, and how is it our guys were interfering!" and "Horrible!"
He was fined 50 G's for that one.
"Hey, $50,000? Inflation, I guess," Wilson cracked last week.
Wilson hopes to get the last say. N.F.L. owners meet this week in Phoenix in their annual spring meeting, and officiating and instant replay will command center stage. Wilson leads a group of owners who are expected to bring replay back to the N.F.L. for the 1999 season. There is growing discontent with officiating -- too many rules, too many bad calls, too many game-swinging bad calls -- owners and coaches say. Enough discontent to bring back replay, used from 1986 through 1991, after a seven-year absence.
"I have always been anti-instant replay," said Wilson, "but . . ."
He laughed. Thinking of last season -- the New England game, and the Jets game when Vinny Testaverde scored a game-ending, game-winning, phantom touchdown against Seattle on a run in which he did not cross the goal line -- made Wilson want to cry. Both games were costly to Buffalo as it tried to earn a first-round playoff game at home. Instead, the Bills played on the road, at Miami, and lost.
"The officiating last year and really the last couple of years has helped to change my mind," Wilson said. "If an offensive lineman breathes, it's called motion. The officiating needs to be simplified and streamlined. And it's not just calls against us. We benefited in a game last year where they called pass interference and the ball was 10 feet over the head of the receiver and the defensive back. No way it was going to be caught by us, but there was the flag.
"Replay cannot correct all of these things, but it's a start. I'm for it -- now, let's see what kind of system we're talking about."
The talk is that the owners will be presented a replay system tied to challenges. A team would receive two challenges a game and extra challenges in the final two minutes of each half. The referee makes the final decision on the challenge. If the call is upheld, the team that requested the challenge loses a timeout. If the call is overturned, the team that makes the challenge does not lose a timeout. In the final two minutes, an official upstairs can halt play and ask for a review a play and the referee will make the final call.
This system, or some variation, seems certain to pass. Approval will require 24 of the 31 owners' votes.
Wilson, though, says beware. "When you go into one of these meetings there is no such thing as a lock," he said. "There is no sure thing. I've gone into a few of these where everything looked certain and everybody left saying, 'What happened?' "
The owners this week are expected to consider approval of the Washington Redskins sale for $800 million to the real-estate magnate Howard Milstein and to award the league's 32d franchise to either Houston or Los Angeles. The front-runner is Los Angeles, where two groups in the city are vying for ownership.
A testy vote might occur on the idea of rotating the Thanksgiving Day games to several teams around the league rather than allowing the current host cities, Detroit and Dallas, alone to continue the tradition.
Wilson said: "What I've seen happen in the last 10 years has taken away too much tradition in the N.F.L. Why are we trying to shred away the last bit we have? I strongly disapprove of this. The fans in Detroit, in particular, go to this game and sell it out every year despite the team's record. Families take their kids and have been doing so for years. It's more than a game there. Moving it is a bad idea."

HEADLINE: Resurgence of a Grime Fighter

BYLINE: By DANA CANEDY 

DATELINE: OAKLAND, Calif.

 BODY:
THREE years ago, when consumers complained about the smell of its bleach, the Clorox Company cut the chlorine odor by adding floral scents -- and helped increase its share of the American bleach market to a remarkable 60 percent.
Last year, after a competitor introduced a cleaning spray intended for daily use in the shower, Clorox unabashedly copied it -- but used a clear bottle with pastel labeling, a contrast to the rival's industrial-looking container. More appealing packaging, the company figured, would prompt consumers to leave the bottle near the shower instead of under the sink, increasing the likelihood that they would use it each day. The product, Tilex Fresh Shower, quickly became a big seller. 
 Pedestrian fiddling with pedestrian products, many a metal-bending or electron-zapping executive might sniff. But not a smart investor. Clorox's stock has shot up 372 percent the last five years -- 45 percent the last year alone. That has far outpaced the market, outgunned industry giants like Procter & Gamble and Colgate-Palmolive and proved to stock snobs that there is gold in the most everyday goods.
And this year? Well, it's time for Clorox to prove itself all over again.
In acquiring the First Brands Corporation of Danbury, Conn. -- maker of familiar products like Glad bags, Scoop Away cat box filler and STP motor oil additive -- Clorox has bought a company that increases its size by almost 50 percent but that resembles the vapid Clorox that G. Craig Sullivan took over seven years ago.
Back then, Clorox, which competitors had mostly dismissed as knowing how to sell bleach but not much else, was stuck with a complacent management and a tired product line. Its profits were falling, and its stockholders were skittish. Mr. Sullivan, who studied accounting, began his career selling cake mix in Brooklyn for P.& G. and was hardly a golden boy. His own mother once suggested he might not make it in sales and urged him to consider a new line of work. Investors reacted to his appointment by knocking the stock down 5 percent in a single day.
They soon had a change of heart. First, Mr. Sullivan cut managers he judged to be out of step with the new marching orders. "When you've got 25 or 30 years of white-rat training, sometimes it's hard to change, so we just decided for them that maybe they ought to do something else," he said. Half the management team left.
Then he dumped money-losing operations like bottled water and restaurant equipment, bought grime-fighting brands like Lestoil cleaner and S.O.S scrubbing pads that were more in line with Clorox's core business. And he stepped up marketing for existing brands like Pine-Sol and Formula 409 cleansers.
The results have made the one-time Wall Street wallflower the life of the party: from the time that Mr. Sullivan took over through the end of last year, Clorox's revenues increased by 76 percent to $2.7 billion, while profits shot up 200 percent, to $298 million. The company's market capitalization in that time rose from $2.5 billion to $10 billion. Clorox shares closed at $125.50 on Friday on the New York Stock Exchange.
BUT with the purchase of First Brands for $2 billion -- a deal that closed in January -- some investors are wondering whether Clorox has overextended itself. The deal, the largest in Clorox's 86-year history, increases its revenue to a projected $3.95 billion.
But like the Clorox of old, First Brands had struggled with a number of stalled or fading products. Slowing retail sales resulted in disappointing earnings for the company last year. So some analysts and investors who have been enthusiastic about Clorox wonder whether the growth of the 1990's can be sustained.
"The big difficulty will be how life is different under the auspices of Clorox," said Andrew Shore, an analyst who follows the company for Paine Webber. "First Brands may have an initial good boost from cutting costs and new advertising and new products, but I think Clorox has to make First Brands a much better organization."
Not to worry, Mr. Sullivan said, noting that a key element of Clorox's growth strategy has been to dust off brands that had lost their luster under previous owners. That, he said, is what made products like S.O.S and Armor All car-care products such good fits. "With all due respect," Mr. Sullivan said, "those companies, and I think they would admit it themselves, were not consumer brand-focused."
Mr. Sullivan says he has the formula to keep things going, and it's pretty simple: Execute. Freshen old brands, extend product lines, improve advertising, squeeze costs. He intends to maximize the First Brands investment, for example, by steadily adding new features to Glad bags and wraps, much as diaper makers do to their products, and extending the brand name to entirely different products that will likely hit store shelves next year. (He's holding off on discussing the details.)
Of the former First Brands managers, he said bluntly: "They don't understand the consumer, they don't understand that their target may not be the right target and their advertising mix may not be correct."
Mr. Sullivan has been there before, tinkering with even well-respected brands to unleash their potential.
When the company bought the Armor All Products Corporation two years ago, it saw unrealized promise in a product called Flash Black, a clear liquid in a black bottle that is used to shine tires.
To emphasize the gloss potential that Flash Black was supposed to deliver, Clorox repackaged it in a clear bottle and changed the name to Extreme Tire Shine. It was minor tweaking, but it "essentially doubled the business," said Derrick Gordon, a group marketing manager in Clorox's auto products division.
The marketing team also scuttled what it viewed as a mismanaged ad campaign created for Armor All by the previous owner. "How do I say it? They didn't understand really who their customer was," Mr. Sullivan said of Armor All's managers.
Karen Rose, Clorox's chief financial officer, pointed to Armor All's choice as its spokesman of the retired football star Terry Bradshaw as a major marketing misstep. "He was a quarterback for the Pittsburgh Steelers back in the 1970's, so you know he doesn't have all of his hair anymore," Ms. Rose said. And since the target customer base for Armor All is males aged 16 to 25, "Terry Bradshaw doesn't speak to that."
One of Clorox's ad agencies, DDB Needham San Francisco, came up with fresher ads. Spots for a car wax that the company is introducing under the Armor All name clearly have youthful testosterone in mind. They use hip music and a sporty car to depict what looks like a party at a car wash.
Using the tag line "stay a little longer," the commercials feature a model with a come-hither pout who borrows the sports car's rear-view mirror to apply red lipstick. Since it is obvious that she has no intention of scrubbing the tires, the impression seems to be that Armor All will not only produce a lasting shine, it just might help you find a girl.
Clorox has been known to take creative liberties in other commercials. Recognizing that its Hidden Valley salad-dressing line had confused consumers with too many new products, another of its agencies, Young & Rubicam San Francisco, dreamed up a slogan that ran the risk of flouting Americans' infatuation with change at breakneck speed: "Not new and improved."
"One of the things we found is that consumers don't want to think about food products coming from a big processor," explained David Matz, a Clorox general manager. "They want to think about it coming from my grandmother's formula."
That may be, but no matter how wholesome and folksy an image it wants to project, Clorox is clearly driven by technology and research. It spends about 2 percent of revenues, in line with its peers' budgets, to create products meant to better clean sinks or shine glass. At its 28-acre product-development nerve center in nearby Pleasanton, workers go to odd lengths in the name of innovation.
In a recent test of the effectiveness of a pet product, for instance, they lent their noses for, of all things, sniff tests of used cat litter. "The basic premise is, if you don't like it, how can you expect the consumer to buy it?" said Vincent E. Alvarez, director of technology. "Why is your nose any different than their nose?"
Of course, much of the research is far more high tech: computer design and testing of plastic products, an automated system for soiling cloth to test stain removers and computerized testing of the effects of humidity on packaging. Such work has helped to cut costs and enabled Clorox slash its average product-development time to six months, from two years.
The R & D army is a key contributor to the company's battle to control the supermarket cleaning aisle, but some products seem to provide insurmountable challenges.
Clorox's insecticide sales, for example, have slipped lately, with sales falling by percentages in the low single digits last year; shipments of its Combat and Black Flag brand were off 3 percent in the latest quarter. Executives say Clorox never wanted to be a major factor in the bug business, but was forced to take the Combat line when it bought Pine-Sol; even Mr. Sullivan acknowledged that the company was "trying to figure that business out."
Still, the product development folks have gone to great lengths to develop new ways to trap and kill household pests. At the sprawling research campus, the company built a veritable insect zoo, to study the behavior of roaches, mosquitoes and ants. There is even a "roach rearing room" where workers watch the bugs breed.
And, as luck would have it, the campus was unwittingly built on an ant colony, which provided all sorts of opportunities for watching those insects travel and eat.
But if Clorox is determined to fight on in the insecticide aisle, the company tends not to suffer losses on product lines for long. For example, in 1994 it introduced Hidden Valley salad dressings aimed at children, with flavors like pizza and nacho sauce. Unfortunately, while parents seemed to like them, youngsters turned up their noses. And so Clorox discontinued the line after a year.
"They don't have a golden touch, and not everything goes well," said Timothy Ghriskey, a senior portfolio manager at the Dreyfus Corporation, which owns 380,000 shares of Clorox, "but they seem willing to cut things off as well when they are not working."
Even so, maintaining the rapid gains of the last few years will be a challenge. About 80 percent of Clorox's revenues and profits come from the United States; in contrast, about 80 percent of Colgate-Palmolive's business is overseas. Clorox is seeking to increase its relatively tiny international presence, but with the economic outlook uncertain in much of the world, that effort carries its own risks.
Moreover, at 38 times forward earnings, Clorox stock is trading at a multiple more typical of technology stocks like Intel and Microsoft than of a maker of toilet cleansers. Indeed, some investors, while still bullish on Clorox's management and strategy, have begun to dump the stock because the price has become so rich.
Stephen Yacktman, vice president of Yacktman Asset Management in Chicago, which has owned Clorox shares since 1994, said his firm bought the stock at a price 7 times earnings before income, depreciation and amortization. With that measure now at 20, he added, "the big upside from that is not going to be there."
He is still a Clorox fan, but has sold some of his shares.
Even so, many analysts remain optimistic about the stock's future growth potential. "This company finds new niches and finds that consumer whose need is not being met," said Carole Warner of Prudential Securities. "They own the cleaning aisle."
More fundamentally, said Mr. Shore of Paine Webber, "this is a company that had tremendous self-doubt in the 1980's, and I think Craig Sullivan made them believe they could be better than they ever thought they were."
"That's the equivalent of what a good coach is to a team," he added.
While Clorox investors have certainly enjoyed hefty returns, Mr. Sullivan's compensation package is relatively modest, said Graef S. Crystal, an executive compensation critic. Although Mr. Sullivan's $800,000 annual salary and $1.1 million bonus last year was "within the normal range" for his peer group, Mr. Crystal said, the pay package was actually 49 percent below the market because it did not include stock options and restricted shares.
FOR decades, Clorox was a sleepy, one-product company. It was founded in 1913 by five Oakland entrepreneurs who started a bleach factory with $500 and did not add another product for 56 years. The company became a division of P.& G. in 1957 and was divested in 1969.
Clorox's roots help explain the culture that Mr. Sullivan faced in 1992, when he was elevated from group vice president over the outgoing chief executive's heir apparent. The company controlled about half of the bleach business, and its rivals simply followed at a distance. But now -- having bulked up in the 90's into a formidable and diversified consumer-products concern -- it must find a way to hang onto its new-found entrepreneurial spirit and remain nimble enough to fend off industry giants as well as upstarts.
In other words, Mr. Sullivan must prove himself all over again. That, it seems, is fine with him, since few people thought he could pull it off the first time. And while always careful to spread the credit, he has enough executive ego to suggest that his last seven shareholder letters are useful reading -- a reminder that this is a company that now delivers on its promises.
"But again," he added, "this isn't about me."

Chart: "New and Improved
Since G. Craig Sullivan became chief executive of Clorox in 1992, the company has taken off, making acquisitions, extending product lines and sharpening its marketing. Sales grew 77 percent, profits more than tripled, and the companys market value increased fourfold through last year. Now, the acquisition of First Brands, a company roughly half the size of Clorox, is challenging Mr. Sullivan's team to repeat the performance. The chart shows the dates of the key domestic and foreign acquisitions since 1992. Two other charts compare the fiscal year 1992, with the fiscal year 1998. (pg. 13)

HEADLINE: If You're Thinking of Living In / Danbury, Conn.;
Bustling, but Studded With Lakes, Ponds

BYLINE: By ELEANOR CHARLES 

 BODY:
THIS 315-year-old city has a history that could well have inspired Connecticut's informal motto -- "the land of steady habits." With unwavering resolve it routed a British invasion during the Revolutionary War, rebounded from the demise of its major industry -- hat-making -- and survived the death in 1981 of its beloved 112-year-old Great Danbury Fair.
A middle-of-the-road community, with few super-rich or very poor residents, "it is as resilient as a community can be," said Gene F. Eriquez, the city's five-term Mayor. "Diversity is our strength -- in our economy, and in the 75 different ethnic groups in our population." 
 The city's housing stock, which dates from the 18th century, has attracted commuters, summer-home buyers, corporate transferees and others for its prices -- about a third lower than comparable homes in lower Fairfield County, its variety of architectural styles and neighborhoods and the beauty of the countryside.
Over the last five years, as prices rose and interest rates dropped, home buyers have found a wide selection, from $17,000 mobile-home resales to new luxury residences, at least one priced at $1.4 million.
Since early last year, more than 1,000 detached homes and condominium units have been built or are still under construction. They are being sold predominantly to nonresidents. "People moving in have higher incomes than local people," explained Richard Jowdy, a broker with Prudential Connecticut Realty.
Earlier this month, 101 homes are for sale priced under $300,000, and only 46 are priced over $300,000 "reflecting the fact that most housing in Danbury is older, in established neighborhoods," said Allyson J. Bernard, partner at Real Estate Professionals, a local real estate brokerage.
But most buyers want new construction and because buildable land is fast disappearing, developers are putting up bigger, more ostentatious houses to compensate for the cost of the lots. The shortage, said Ms. Bernard, "is causing bidding wars."
Prices in the back country, where open land still exists, are especially vulnerable to high costs. "Environmentalists are dictating what you can build on," said Ellen Boyle, a Prudential broker. "If you have wetlands you have to take more land, pushing real estate values up." According to Dorothy Charney of ReMax Unlimited Real Estate, "the average new construction is in the $550,000 to $800,000 range."
Joseph Novella, a local developer, says that Danbury "is awash in corporate transferees." Cendant Mobility, an employee-reclocation company; I.B.M. and Boehringer Ingelheim, a pharmaceutical company, are some of the major sources of home buyers.
With his partner, Ginsberg Development Corporation of Danbury, he is building 24 custom homes of 3,600 to 4,500 square feet on two-acre lots at Shoreview Estates on Candlewood Lake. Eleven houses priced from $575,000 to $850,000 have been sold and occupied; one 6,800-square-foot Victorian was sold for $1.4 million. The 94-acre subdivision contains a residents' beach, one boat slip for each house and a boat launch.
Back-country Danbury is studded with more than a dozen lakes and ponds and four reservoirs, and along the winding roads and wooded hills are numerous antique homes and former farms. Large handsomely restored older homes scattered through the town are also selling well. Daniel Elysee, an investment specialist from New York, paid more than $500,000 for a 4,800-square-foot house with pool built in the 50's on three acres.
TWO subdivisions are under construction by Toll Brothers, of Huntingdon, Pa. -- Westville Estates with 31 four-bedroom customized homes on lots of up to two acres selling from the high $300,000's to the mid-$400,000's and Ridgebury Hills with 90 homes priced from $300,000 to $320,000. Models are expected to open in May and contracts have been signed on nearly a dozen houses to be completed in August.
Other choices include two-bedroom town houses at Lake Place, an established 160-unit condominium community on Kenosia Lake, where Ellen Goodwill, product director of marketing for Boehringer Ingelheim, bought a unit for $195,000. "It's like coming home to a little resort," she said, "with the lake and pool."
Philip Edelstein recently bought a new $250,000 home at Sterling Woods, a 354-unit mix of 77 detached houses and 277 town-house units with a pool, fitness center and clubhouse. "I work out four times a week with a gentleman two doors away," he said. "We've become buddies."
The rental shortage is being addressed by Avalon Bay Properties with two apartment complexes, the 268-unit Avalon Valley with 268 units on the east side of town near the junction of Routes 6 and 7 and Interstate 84 and the 128-unit Avalon Lake near Kenosia Lake, both under construction for a summer opening.
Danbury's downtown has been enlivened with new shops, sidewalk cafes, and nightclubs. Restaurants and ethnic food shops located all over the city cater to tastes from every part of the globe. Restaurants at the high end include Ondine, with French cuisine, and La Fortuna's, serving Italian cuisine.
Main Street -- where a four-block stretch from White Street to Park Place is on the National Register of Historic Places -- has had its landscaped divider restored, and nearby a new $8 million ice rink is to open in late spring. A $5.6 million expansion of City Hall is nearing completion, and the public library has been renovated, computerized and enlarged. To facilitate the movement of traffic, "we are upgrading 53 intersections throughout the city," said Mayor Eriquez.
Some unusual diversions include the Danbury Railroad Museum at the restored former railway station. It was the setting for the Hitchcock thriller "Strangers on a Train." The Scott-Fanton Museum & Historical Society features memorabilia and 60 antique quilts and an outdoor display of boardable tanks is one of the features at the Military Museum.
In summer there are jazz concerts at Danbury Green and year-round concerts are performed at Western Connecticut State University's Charles Ives Center for the Arts, named for the Danbury composer. Movies are available at a new 10-screen Loews Theater, where an additional 10 screens are planned.
Sports activities include an 18-hole golf course at Richter Park. Residents pay $18 a day or $675 a season, nonresidents are charged $48 a day or $1,675 a season. The park also has a summer theater, two tennis courts, fishing, and hiking trails.
Danbury has 1,950 acres of open space, 557 acres of it developed as 16 parks and playgrounds offering bird-watching, hiking, swimming, soccer, lacrosse, basketball, wading pools, bowling, and a nature center. Rogers Park has eight tennis courts, lighted until 10:30 P.M.; 10 ballfields, a paddleball court, skating pond, handball, and playground. Resident tennis passes cost $15 a season, $5 for students, $30 for nonresidents.
Resident passes for swimming, picnicking, and the beach at the 5,420-acre Candlewood Lake cost $15; daily passes are $3. Nonresident guests pay $6 a day. Use of the residents-only boat ramp costs $15 a season, or $5 a day.
Retail sales receipts for the year ending Nov. 30, 1998, were $4.02 billion, making Danbury the undisputed shopping mecca of Connecticut, outstripping Stamford, its nearest rival, by about $2.6 billion. Hundreds of big-box and small stores, auto dealers, and strip shopping centers have spread out from the 1.5 million square-foot Danbury Fair Mall, which replaced the Great Danbury Fair in 1987, along Federal Road and Route 6 to the Brookfield border.
THE city's 15 million square feet of industrial and office space in several commercial parks, help maintain the lowest unemployment rate in the state, at 1.9 percent. To accommodate local business growth a Comfort Inn and a Marriott Residence Inn are under construction and a Radisson hotel and a Hilton Gardens recently opened.
To accommodate the 48 percent of Danbury's children who speak languages other than English, the public schools focus on remedial programs and parent involvement, while offering gifted, talented and advanced placement courses to qualified students. More than 81 percent of high school graduates go on to higher education.
A total of 8,916 pupils attend 13 elementary schools, two middle schools, one high school and one alternate high school for students who need special help. S.A.T.'s of 477 math and 483 verbal are below state averages of 503 and 505, respectively.
Among private schools in town are a Montessori School for children 6 weeks to 10 years old, at $130 to $240 a week and the k-12 Wooster School, a co-ed college preparatory day school founded in 1926, with an enrollment of 370. Tuition ranges from $9,000 to $15,000 a year.
Information about numerous day-care services, nursery schools, Christian and Jewish parochial schools may be obtained by calling the Community Resource Center at (203) 797-4733.
Danbury and four other towns are concerned about the disposition of Connecticut Light & Power Company land around Candlewood Lake's 60-mile shoreline.
Ordered to dispose of the property under deregulation, the utility must sell 90 percent of the land from the water to a 12-foot elevation, and 1,000 scattered acres above. "We are negotiating with C.L.T. & P. to put a conservation easement in place," said Mayor Eriquez, "for open space and recreation."

HAT CITY: In the 17th century, Danbury was called Swampfield, a name taken from topographical conditions in which beavers thrived, providing material for the settlement's infant beaver-hat industry. By the middle of the 19th century and into the 20th, Danbury was called the Hat City, turning out prodigious quantities of hats by Stetson, Mallory, Dodd and many others.
 One manufacturer, Charles Darling Parks, developed a hatting process that did not require the use of mercury, a poisonous chemical that had previously been known to cause insanity in hat-factory workers, giving rise to the phrase "mad as a hatter," according to local lore.

BYLINE: By Alan Ryan; Alan Ryan is the author of "John Dewey and the High Tide of American Liberalism."

 BODY:

Sex and Social Justice
 By Martha C. Nussbaum.
 476 pp. New York:
 Oxford University Press. $35. 
 A bookstore browser who knew no philosophy and nothing of Martha C. Nussbaum might be startled by the title "Sex and Social Justice." Sexual attractiveness and sexual happiness are just about the least justly distributed of all human goods, and even the most optimistic politicians have never pretended that much can be done about it. As one would guess, Nussbaum does not connect sex and social justice quite so swiftly as that -- although one of her themes certainly is the wickedness of social conventions that deny women the same chance of sexual happiness as men, and the wickedness of laws that deny homosexuals an equal chance of forming successful sexual partnerships on the same terms as heterosexual couples.
"Sex and Social Justice" is highly readable, and very engaging. It is elegantly written and carefully argued. Its references to Aristotle, John Stuart Mill, Immanuel Kant and John Rawls will fall more easily on the ear of philosophers than on the ear of the lay reader, but Nussbaum is such a clear and fastidious writer that the most lay of lay readers will painlessly learn a great deal about Aristotle's view of happiness, Mill's distaste for seeing women treated as if they were children, Kant's insistence that we must treat one another with reverence for our common humanity and Rawls's theory of social justice.
The book consists of 15 substantial essays that range from the economic exploitation of illiterate women in Bangladesh to the introspection of Mrs. Ramsay in "To the Lighthouse"; they take in Andrea Dworkin's enraged denunciations of the way men regard women, Richard Posner's coolly ironic discussions of the commercialization of sex, and the strange encounter between Plato's "Symposium" and the state of Colorado. If that appears to be a pretty mixed agenda, there are some recurrent themes that hold the book together and give it a unity of style and purpose.
One of them does much to give the book its readability. Nussbaum, who is the Ernst Freund Professor of Law and Ethics at the University of Chicago, worked for some years on a United Nations project dealing with transnational comparisons in standards of living. It evidently gave her a taste for empirical evidence, and she uses it here to great effect. The first sentence of the first essay is enough to bring the reader up short: "I may die, but still I cannot go out. If there's something in the house, we eat. Otherwise, we go to sleep." The speaker is a young widow from Rajasthan, India; her husband died a little while ago, and she belongs to a caste whose women may not work outside the home. Her elderly father comes a hundred miles to plow the little plot of land she lives off. When he dies, she and her children may very well die with him.
Why? What, or who, prevents Metha Bai from going out to work? Not a shortage of work; not her own incapacity. The "what" is the local culture, and the "who" includes her own relatives, who will beat her if she tries to leave her house. This little horror story anchors the second of the themes that sustain the book. Local cultures are not sacrosanct; they license any amount of cruelty, oppression and misery. Identity is much overrated, especially for women who in most cultures find their identity construed in relation to fathers, brothers and husbands. The communitarianism lately fashionable in the American academy and on the lips of American and British leaders can be bad for your health; indeed, as the example of Metha Bai suggests, it can be fatal.
In the name of what, though, are we to condemn local traditions? Does it not show an unpleasantly chauvinistic, even imperialist attitude to object to the ways in which other societies make sense of their daily lives? Is it not an outdated Enlightenment view that there is a unitary human nature that in all times and all places needs the same things? Is it not the sort of simple-minded liberalism that we have rightly learned to reject -- individualistic, rationalistic, obsessed with freedom of choice?
Nussbaum's response is unflinching. It is not true that the world divides neatly into individualistic, choice-obsessed Westerners and contented traditionalists. The girls who suffer clitoridectomy -- firmly labeled female genital mutilation by Nussbaum -- do not volunteer for it; they are forcibly mistreated, and would plainly wish to have a choice in the matter. Metha Bai plainly wants to have the choice between starving to death in accordance with tradition and doing something to keep herself and her children alive.
It is an oddity of recent arguments, not about the developing world but about our own, that feminists have been hostile to liberalism. Conversely, quite a number of writers who have thought of themselves as defending the verities of the liberal tradition have got very angry with contemporary feminists. Nussbaum treads a delicate path. She does not succumb to the urge to cry "A plague on both your houses"; instead, she courteously unpicks the plaintiffs' cases and allows their frailty to emerge. So when Alison Jaggar attacks what she sees as the egoism and individualism of liberalism, we are reminded that moral individualism is a commitment to holding individuals responsible for doing what they ought, not an encouragement to seize what they can. And when Christina Hoff Sommers attacks feminists who distinguish between what women seem to want and what they really want, the impeccable John Stuart Mill is brought on to suggest that it is a crucial distinction -- not only in the case of women's wishes -- and that helping people to know what they really want is not achieved by giving them the vote alone. Education and an egalitarian workplace are also crucial ingredients.
Recently, some of the weirdest events in American legal and political life have been those that centered on the legal treatment of homosexuality. The Supreme Court's judgment in Bowers v. Hardwick, upholding a Florida statute criminalizing oral sex on the strength of what long-dead English judges once said about anal sex, was perhaps the oddest. But the attempt by the citizens of the state of Colorado to remove the political rights of homosexuals was a close runner-up: Amendment 2 made it an article of the state constitution that no jurisdiction could allow plaintiffs to claim that they had been discriminated against because of sexual orientation. Nussbaum got involved in the ensuing fracas by a strange route. Once Amendment 2 had been suspended as prima facie unconstitutional, the state had to show that something other than mere bigotry had animated it, or, to put it more politely, that a compelling interest not grounded in a particular religious perspective had animated it. Enter Plato. If the state could show that non-Judeo-Christian Greek philosophers had also thought homosexuality a threat to society, it might be just about possible to show that a rational person could support Amendment 2.
Nussbaum was not content with waiting for the Supreme Court to throw out Amendment 2, which it duly did. She set out to show that Plato was in fact friendly to same-sex relationships that displayed the qualities that any affectionate relationship should display -- that each party treated the other as an equal and that physical intimacy was a means to spiritual intimacy. For the slightly skeptical bystander, this may be a shade more high-minded than the case merits. Allowing a moral philosopher to judge the spiritual depth of our sexual desires might be a wonderful way of reducing overpopulation; whether it's the best way to inspire common sense in the Colorado citizenry is another matter.

HEADLINE: Needed: a G.O.P. Environmental Identity

BYLINE: By Tom Ridge; Tom Ridge is Governor of Pennsylvania.

DATELINE: HARRISBURG, Pa.

 BODY:
At the turn of the century, President Theodore Roosevelt derided political leaders who talked a good game on the environment but did little else as "nature fakers." Roosevelt would probably apply that same label to many of today's politicians -- including some members of his own Republican Party.
Too many Republicans have allowed the party's bedrock principle of limited government to excuse the absence of an aggressive, creative environmental strategy -- resulting in a widely held belief that Republicans are more interested in protecting big business than in preserving our parks, air, rivers and forests. 
 As a result, environmental policy is monopolized by Democratic ideas. The public faces a choice between Democratic clean air and Republican economic growth.
The truth is that we need both. And Republicans need to present alternatives to Democratic policies -- alternatives that effectively address environmental crises without betraying the party's core values.
The Republicans' latest missed opportunity came when Vice President Al Gore recently announced his proposal to curb suburban sprawl. Certainly, politicians of both parties can agree that the strip-malling of America's rural landscape is a serious environmental problem -- and one that should make us rethink the way that cities and businesses grow.
The Vice President has responded to the sprawl problem with a traditional environmentalist plan: for the Federal Government to buy and conserve large tracts of open space. But instead of simply opposing this as another costly, interventionist Federal program, Republicans should seize the chance to promote a solution that would counter sprawl while supporting responsible growth.
Among the biggest factors contributing to suburban sprawl are the substantial Federal impediments to the redevelopment of urban land. Often, businesses invade the countryside because they can't afford to clean up and reuse polluted industrial sites in the cities. There are about 250,000 such sites nationwide, with an average size of about 20 acres -- so there may be millions of acres of urban land lying needlessly fallow.
Many companies will not develop urban sites because they fear being penalized for the sins of past polluters -- the result of a Federal environmental protection bureaucracy that measures success by the number of businesses prosecuted and the amount of the fines levied.
In Pennsylvania, we've discovered that a strategy of cooperation with businesses, not confrontation, works best to revitalize cities and contain sprawl in the suburbs.
The Federal Superfund program has, in 18 years, cleaned up only 13 of its original 111 sites in Pennsylvania -- incurring unconscionable costs with little to show for it. By comparison, in just four years, a state land-recycling program has cleaned up and put to use more than 350 polluted industrial sites in Pennsylvania. The program gives developers immunity from liability once they have met certain clearly defined standards insuring that future occupants of their property will not be exposed to harmful pollutants.
For too long, too many Republicans have opposed almost any government involvement in environmental management. At the same time, too many Democrats have believed that government is the only player that matters. This either/or approach has held businesses hostage, rendered government ineffectual and left the environment to degrade.
Pennsylvania's experience shows that Republicans have to offer their own model of environmental stewardship. That way, people can judge who are the nature fakers -- and who, like Theodore Roosevelt, are the true conservationists.

HEADLINE: 3 More Airlines Raise Fares In 2d Industry Move This Year

BYLINE: By LAURENCE ZUCKERMAN 

 BODY:
Northwest Airlines, U S Airways and Trans World Airlines raised ticket prices over the weekend, matching fare increases made late last week by the nation's other major carriers.
It was the industry's second price increase this year and comes as airlines try to raise revenue to meet Wall Street expectations but also face a strong backlash from consumers and some politicians. 
 The airlines raised the fares for last-minute unrestricted tickets favored by business travelers by 1 percent and for less expensive advance-purchase tickets that are intended for vacationers by 3 percent. The previous wave of increases, which began in late January, raised business fares by 2 percent and leisure fares by 4 percent. Before that, the industry had not raised prices systemwide in more than a year.
Airlines file their prices several times a day to a centralized computer system and are barred by law from alerting one another to any changes beforehand. The industry is so price-sensitive that an across-the-board fare increase will not stick unless all major carriers go along. Thus the latest increase, which was initiated by United Airlines, a unit of the UAL Corporation, on Thursday, was not assured until the last three holdouts -- Northwest, U S Airways and T.W.A. -- also raised their prices.
Northwest said it matched the rise on Saturday; a spokeswoman for T.W.A. said the airline raised its prices yesterday, and U S Airways declined to comment but the other carriers said it, too, matched the fare increase.
Though systemwide fare increases have been scarce until recently, the prices for unrestricted walk-up fares between major cities have risen steadily during the last three years, while many leisure fares have fallen. The high fares paid by business travelers -- which rose as high as $2,000 for a round-trip coach ticket coast to coast in 1998 -- have outraged many corporations. Politicians have complained that the high cost of travel limits economic growth in their regions.
At the same time, overcrowded planes, cutbacks in amenities like in-flight meals and a rising number of delays have increased consumer frustration. Several lawmakers in Congress have proposed legislation to promote more competition in the industry and to improve airline accountability.
After four consecutive years of record profits, the industry is now facing pressure from Wall Street. Airline sales began declining late last year and do not appear to be recovering despite the country's continuing strong economic growth. In addition, many carriers are expanding their fleets this year, leading some analysts to think that fares will have to be cut to assure that those added seats are filled.
Samuel Buttrick, an analyst at Paine Webber, said that each successive increase helped the airlines less than the previous one because they still must offer corporate discounts and other incentives. "It just means that the sales will be deeper," he said.

HEADLINE: Massacres of Low-Born Touch Off a Crisis in India

BYLINE: By CELIA W. DUGGER 

DATELINE: SHANKER BIGHA, India

 BODY:
This hamlet on the edge of a lush, palm-fringed field lay quiet on the moonlit night of Jan. 25. But as the villagers slept, more than 50 upper-caste men, members of an outlawed landowners' army, crept toward them through rustling spears of wheat.
The men fanned out in the dirt lanes, flinging open the doors of mud huts and shouting: "Kill them! Kill them!" Guns blazing, they massacred 22 people in just a few minutes, among them a 3-year-old boy and his baby sister, who were crying as they huddled in their grandmother's arms. 
 This massacre of farm workers and their families -- untouchables at the bottom of Hinduism's hierarchical social order -- was numbingly similar to dozens of others committed during nearly three decades in the eastern state of Bihar.
The state is blessed by mineral wealth and fertile soil but cursed by the nation's highest rates of illiteracy and poverty. Almost 9 out of 10 of the state's 100 million people live in the countryside, and more than half are very poor. The untouchables, who make up 14 percent of the population, are the poorest of the poor.
Bihar is now in the midst of an upheaval that has seen the middle castes depose the upper castes from the seats of political power. The untouchables -- now called Dalits, which means ground down in Hindi -- have not yet gained an independent political voice, but they have begun grass-roots organizing.
And as they have banded together under various leftist banners to agitate, sometimes violently, for higher wages, a share of land and an end to the sexual exploitation of Dalit women and other humiliations, both middle- and upper-caste landowners have struck back with terror tactics.
"In the American South after the Civil War, the lynchings of blacks were aimed at curbing their uppitiness," said Ashutosh Varshney, a political scientist at Columbia University. "India never had slavery, but the Dalits are as close to slavery as you can get. The massacres are aimed at checking their uppitiness."
Successive governments, dominated by the upper and middle castes, have failed since the 1970's to stop the carnage or to address the harsh social and economic inequalities between the landed and the landless that persist in Bihar and in most of north India.
But this time, the massacres got caught up in a power struggle between the upper and middle castes.
The bloodletting here in Shanker Bigha and another massacre of 12 untouchables on Feb. 11 in the village of Narayanpur set off a crisis that rocked the state's political establishment, humbled the national governing coalition and, for a time, riveted public attention on the violence that has raged like an intermittent fever.
The Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party, which draws most of its support in Bihar from the upper castes and which leads the national coalition Government, maintained that the massacres justified its dismissal of the middle-caste state government, widely seen as corrupt and inefficient.
But even after central rule was imposed in February, the violence continued. Retaliating for the massacres of untouchables, a squad of leftist militants gunned down seven people on Feb. 14, apparently for no reason except their upper-caste status, human rights workers said. Four more upper-caste men were slain on March 2. The police say they arrested 47 members of the landowners' militia, the Ranvir Sena, for involvement in the two massacres, as well as dozens of members of leftist groups. Human rights groups say the police, dominated by upper castes, have in the past cracked down much harder on the leftists than on the landowners' armies.
 On March 8 the central Government, unable to get its takeover of Bihar ratified in Parliament, took the humiliating step of reinstating the dismissed state officials.
While political intrigues have swirled in New Delhi and the state capital of Patna, the mourning has continued in Shanker Bigha, an isolated hamlet of 300 to 400 Dalits.
There is no road leading into Shanker Bigha, only a dirt pathway through a glorious, rippling field of wheat, the same one used by members of the Ranvir Sena. The village has no electricity, no phone, no school, no clock, no car, no scooter and no health clinic.
Itwaria Devi saw her son, who was about 20, gunned down as he reached the door of her hut to warn her of the danger. The husband of Pyari Thakur was fatally shot in a lane as he rushed to her from the men's sleeping quarters. Sona Dhari, a young mother whose eyes are pits of sorrow, had left her mud hut to go to the bathroom just before the armed men arrived. She told her husband, who was in the men's quarters, to come keep an eye on their 3-year-old son and 9-month-old daughter. By the time he got there, gunfire and screams echoed through the lanes.
"The children started weeping, so I gave them to my mother," said Raj Kumar Paswan, who hid himself while his mother and children cowered on their straw pallet.
When his wife made it back to the tiny, windowless hut, she fainted at the sight that confronted her: the bodies of her mother-in-law, toddler son and baby girl torn apart by bullets and sprawled akimbo on the blood-soaked pallet.
Once the killing was finished, the men shouted, "Long live Ranvir Sena!" Then, with three sharp whistles, they melted away into the field.
There seems to be no reason why Shanker Bigha was singled out for attack, other than its identity as a Dalit settlement. The police and the villagers say there was no dispute between the landowners and the farm workers who labor in the fields for 50 cents a day, less than the widely ignored state minimum wage of almost $1 a day.
"We find it difficult to fill our stomachs," said Mr. Paswan, a slender young man in a loincloth and tank top. "But we were always afraid we'd lose our jobs, so we never raised our voices."
The survivors of the massacre say they recognized some of the killers as familiar residents of Dhobi Bigha, an upper-caste village within plain sight of Shanker Bigha, just on the other side of the wheat field.
Dhobi Bigha is filled with sturdy brick houses inhabited by landowners from the Bhumihar caste, which makes up 3 percent of the state's population. Residents say the village solidly supports the Bharatiya Janata Party.
By Western standards Dhobi Bigha's residents are far from wealthy. Bhumihar landowners in central Bihar own from 2 to at most 50 acres of land. But by Bihar's standards they are the rural elite.
At dusk Shrikant Singh and Kameshwar Singh, Bhumihar landowners, stood talking next to a towering haystack. Both men have sons charged with taking part in the massacre in Shanker Bigha -- charges the fathers deny.
Dhobi Bigha itself was deserted. The men said the other residents had fled, fearing more arrests.
After India gained independence from Britain in 1947, land reform was supposed to bring justice to farmers who had been exploited for hundreds of years by the colonialists. Like states across India, Bihar in the 1950's abolished a system that operated through absentee landlords.
After the reforms, land was distributed to people from upper and middle castes who had been tenants. But the Dalits got virtually nothing. They were pariahs so politically powerless that they were unable to assert their right to a share, said Anand Chakravarti, a sociologist at Delhi University. The Dalits continued providing cheap, pliant labor for the landowning castes.
But in the 1970's, leftist radicals began organizing the Dalits to strike against certain landowners and enforced blockades on their land to prevent them from cultivating crops, often with threats of violence.
The landowners responded with violence. The massacres of Dalits date back to 1971, researchers say. And by 1979, various landowning castes were organizing private armies.
The Ranvir Sena is only the most recent of the armies. It was founded in 1994 in the Bhumihar village of Belaur in central Bihar and has since committed many massacres. The worst was in Laxmanpur-Bathe, where its members killed 61 Dalits on Dec. 1, 1997.
Shivanand Tiwary, a maverick Brahmin in the state legislature who represents a district that is a Ranvir Sena stronghold, said he sympathized with both the oppressed Dalits and the landowners. He understands that the Dalits want to be treated like human beings, he said.
"And I don't approve of the way the Ravir Sena takes revenge," he said. "This is a sick-mind approach. But what would anybody do? Those with small holdings are forced to leave their fields without crops for several years, and that is their only source of income. What will they do?"

HEADLINE: Southwest Flights at MacArthur Take Off to Mixed Reactions

BYLINE: By PAUL ZIELBAUER 

DATELINE: ISLIP, N.Y., March 14

 BODY:
Bumped off an overbooked flight home hours earlier, Jim Mihnovich stood at the end of a long line at Long Island MacArthur Airport this morning a grateful man. Grateful mostly for Southwest Airlines, which started operations at MacArthur today.
"This was awesome," he said, pocketing one of the carrier's distinctive blue plastic boarding passes for a 12:10 P.M. flight to Nashville. 
 But there are others in Islip who do not share Mr. Mihnovich's enthusiasm. While many frequent flyers said they hoped that the arrival of Southwest would force other large airlines to cut prices to the Long Island airport, residents who live near the airport complained about the prospect of more jet engines roaring overhead.
Initially, the airline will offer 12 nonstops a day from MacArthur to Baltimore, Chicago, Nashville and Tampa, Fla. If that modest beginning stimulates enough interest, the airline may add more flights later.
That concerns residents like Ronald Falcone, who said he is already weary of hearing planes flying over his four-bedroom home in Holbrook, a hamlet bordering the airport's property.
"Listen, I use the airport, nobody wants to see it closed," said Mr. Falcone, 43, a manager for an insurance company. "We want to see it prosper. But you could do it with a little bit of class and consideration for the residents. What's this house going to be worth in 10 years if this airport takes off?"
If today's large and enthusiastic crop of first-day passengers was any indication, Southwest may increase the airport's popularity in much less than a decade.
Consider Mr. Mihnovich's story. With no chance of getting on an overbooked American Airlines flight at La Guardia Airport this morning, he summoned his father from Brooklyn for a car ride out to Islip, about 40 miles away.
"I got in the car, got on my cell phone, called Southwest and bought a ticket for $130 -- and that was at the last minute," said Mr. Mihnovich, 35, an executive for a Nashville home health care company. Less than one hour later, he had his boarding pass. "That's pretty amazing," he said.
The airline is almost guaranteed to enhance the image of the no-frills airport, a decaying one-story structure with two linoleum-tiled concourses and 1970's Muzak piped over the public-address system.
Marian Wise, a 56-year-old lawyer who was also waiting for a Southwest flight to Nashville, said the airline's new service would put an end to eight-hour plane-to-train-to-automobile odysseys to visit friends in Islip. "It's inexpensive, it's efficient, they get you where you need to be when you need to be there," she said. "And I love the peanuts."
Islip officials said they expect Southwest to generate hundreds of thousands of dollars in revenue for the town each year. The town's Supervisor, Peter J. McGowan, said he hoped that the eight other airlines that serve the airport would cut fares to match those of Southwest.
"The traveling public will certainly gain from the spirit of competition that Southwest will create," Mr. McGowan said in a telephone interview. "It will certainly help the economy of Islip and all of Long Island. It brings Islip MacArthur Airport into the next millennium, and it helps to bring Long Island into the next millennium."
But some residents in two adjacent communities believe Southwest's arrival at MacArthur, which serves more than a million passengers a year, may be a harbinger of more noise and traffic congestion. Mr. Falcone and other residents have formed the Committee for the Enforcement of MacArthur Airport Control, which is seeking to force Islip to cap the number of daily flights to and from MacArthur and to prohibit late-night flights.
Mr. McGowan said the airport's jet traffic complies with Federal noise regulations and will remain within such boundaries.
Whether Southwest will be able to draw New York City-based passengers away from Kennedy International and La Guardia Airports remains to be seen. Though the airline is offering rock-bottom one-way prices -- $39 to Baltimore, $79 to Chicago or Nashville, and $89 to Tampa -- MacArthur Airport, on the South Shore of Long Island, is a good hour's drive from Manhattan even when there is no traffic.

A Wild Market Ride: From Fearful to Fearless

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS 

 BODY:
There has never been a bull market quite like the one that America is now enjoying. And while there is logically no more significance to approaching 10,000 on the Dow Jones industrial average than there was to approaching 9,500 or any other number, it is worth noting just how far -- and fast -- we have come.
This bull market has reflected and encouraged the renaissance of America's economic power and self-confidence. Its very existence is one reason the economy has been so strong, and the impact of an end to the bull market would be felt even by those who have never invested in a stock or mutual fund. 
 That group, to be sure, is dwindling. As the bull has grown, stocks have gone from a subject of scorn, seen by many as little more than gambling, to being widely regarded as the best long-term investment -- one that both Democrats and Republicans agree should be bought to help finance Social Security. America itself has gone from fearful to supremely self-confident.
The birth of this bull came on Dec. 6, 1974, although no one knew it at the time. That was when the Dow hit bottom at 577.60, having plunged 45 percent in less than two years amid the worst economic news America had seen since the Great Depression. The country was in a recession and inflation was rising. New York City, the financial capital of the country, was on the verge of going broke.
American industry appeared to be in an irreversible decline. There were predictions that first the oil-producing countries, and then the Japanese, would be able to buy America. Such fears played a role in the next two Presidential elections, in which incumbents were rejected.
At the bottom in 1974, the stocks in the Standard & Poor's 500 index were trading at seven times that year's profits. On average, those stocks paid dividends equal to 5.8 percent of their purchase price.
A quarter-century later, almost everything has changed. Books celebrate the American century and Americans lecture Japanese on economics, rather than the reverse. Commodity prices are low, and producers are suffering. Technology is pre-eminent. The value in many companies is seen as being in their brand names, not in their manufacturing plants, which are viewed as expendable.
The rise in stock prices can be traced only in part to the country's economic success. Corporate profits have risen in recent years, but not nearly as rapidly as stock prices. The S.& P. 500 is at 28-times estimated profits, and has a dividend yield of 1.3 percent.
If investors were willing to pay about the same price for profits and dividends as they were in 1974, the Dow today would be around 2,500, not on the verge of topping 10,000. If valuations were equal to those at the 1987 peak, before that year's crash, the Dow would be somewhere between 5,000 and 7,000. That people are willing to pay so much more is a tribute to optimism and to the fact that stocks are now viewed as a long-term sure thing.
In the past couple of years, the breadth of the great bull market has narrowed. Stocks in smaller companies -- Internet operations excluded -- have lagged notably, and the Russell 2,000, an index of stocks that rank just below the 1,000 largest companies, is now about where it was in mid-1997, while the Dow is up nearly 30 percent. For most of the decade, the biggest winners have been in technology and financial services -- the industries through which America has re-emerged as the world's strongest economy.
At the same time, the very existence of the bull market -- and the wealth it has created -- has made Americans far more willing to spend on houses, cars, cell phones and all the other accouterments of the good life. In recent years, that spending has consistently exceeded economists' expectations, producing surprisingly fast growth and reinforcing the bull market.
When -- or should I say "if"? -- the bull market ends, the impact on the American economy and psyche will be much greater than it would have been before so many Americans pinned their hopes for the future on Wall Street's advance. No doubt the pessimism of 1974 was excessive, but so too may be the optimism that seems embedded now as the Dow nears 10,000.

HEADLINE: Art on the Hudson: New Use for an Old Factory Lifts a City's Hopes

BYLINE: By ANDREW C. REVKIN 

DATELINE: BEACON, N.Y., March 12

 BODY:
From the Depression through the booming 1980's, crowds of men and women wearing blue coveralls thronged each day to the sprawling factory on the riverfront here. Around the clock, they printed, cut and folded colorful cartons for Ritz crackers, Milk-Bone dog biscuits, Oreo cookies and other products of what once was the National Biscuit Company.
The presses rumbled so loudly, former workers recall, that a teen-age worker named Sally, with a nice soprano voice, used to sing her lungs out at one bench but could be heard only by the three women standing next to her. 
 In a couple of years, crowds will return to the glass-roofed brick building after its decade of dormancy. But this time, they will most likely be wearing stylish black. The industrial clang of old will be replaced by studied silence as visitors shuffle past sculptures of glowing fluorescent tubes and rust-orange slabs of steel, 450-foot-long pieces of Andy Warhol Pop Art and century-old Hudson River landscapes.
On March 8, the Dia Center for the Arts, a private group that exhibits art in converted Manhattan warehouses, in the high desert of New Mexico, at a firehouse in the Hamptons and at other unorthodox sites around the country, announced plans to create a giant new museum in the old factory building -- with nearly twice the gallery space of the Museum of Modern Art. The site is 50 miles north of New York City on the east bank of the Hudson River, a few steps from the Metro-North stop.
The changes in the factory reflect the changing fortunes of Beacon and the Hudson River Valley. Prosperity used to come from riverside docks, railroad lines and the harnessed energy of tumbling tributaries. Now, local officials and business owners hope it will return in the form of tourism.
For Beacon, the museum should provide the final impetus for renewal, said Clara Lou Gould, the Mayor of this city of 13,000 people, which has no hotels and only one bed-and-breakfast.
The city, with a racially diverse mixture of middle-class and poor families, has long labored to emerge from a postindustrial slumber that has left the river end of Main Street largely boarded up. A recent wave of renovations of Victorian homes has helped. Then, several years ago, came "Nobody's Fool," a Paul Newman film that injected money and revived interest a bit.
But nothing has happened on a scale like this, Ms. Gould said. The art center predicts that the museum will draw 60,000 to 70,000 visitors a year once it opens in the spring of 2001. "It's kind of mind-boggling," she said.
The factory's previous owner, the International Paper Company, had been trying to sell it for several years, with an asking price of about $2 million. Ms. Gould said there had been inquiries from a fish-farming company and other businesses, but nothing seemed promising until a year ago, when the Dia center first considered the site as a home for most of its extensive art collection. In the collection are many unwieldy works, including a series of steel shapes by Richard Serra weighing a total of 750 tons.
Michael Govan, the director of the art center, recalled how he followed the factory watchman into the main printing hall, with its football-field breadth and acres of glass skylights facing north -- designed so the printers had the best light.
"When I walked in that door," Mr. Govan said, "my initial reaction was, if I were going to build a museum from scratch, I would build it just like this. Concrete and steel. Wood floors. Space between columns. Perfect light. A Metro-North train stop."
Dia's staff had been considering other buildings as far afield as North Adams, Mass., but nothing compared to this, he said, adding, "The whole thing was clear in one fell swoop."
But there were also buckets and drums brimming with water dripping from the roof, warped floorboards, broken windows, and walls shedding so many flakes of paint that they resemble a Jackson Pollock.
Nonetheless, within a few days, Mr. Govan began praising the site to trustees and Dia's stable of artists. In the final deal, the building is being donated by the paper company. Most of the estimated $20 million cost of transforming the 70-year-old structure into a museum will be paid through donations, with about $2.8 million coming from state and local economic development and arts programs, Mr. Govan said.
Uphill from the factory at the east end of town, where antiques shops and bakeries have sprouted over the last few years, the museum was just about the only topic of conversation.
A few residents bemoaned the loss of about $25,000 a year in property taxes from the 26-acre factory tract once it is owned by a nonprofit group. But many merchants echoed the views of Mayor Gould about the economic benefits.
Sheila Wicklow, a co-owner of the Little Pie Shop and the president of the Beacon Business Association, said the Dia center had shown a commitment to public schools in Manhattan. "Now, schools here will have this in their own backyard," she said.
At Beacon's other art institution, the Tallix Foundry, the staff said the museum would perfectly complement its work. As he wove his way through a crazy assemblage of giant and tiny bronzes of horses, heroes, frogs, eagles and abstractions, Peter S. Homestead, the president of Tallix, said museum visitors would also want to see the foundry.
"There, they can go and see the pieces hanging on the wall," he said. "Here, they can see them being made. It's a perfect fit."
For the moment, at least, the 540-foot-long printing plant, with stalks of milkweed sprouting from its foundation, remains a ghostly vestige of the past. It fell on hard times in the mid-1980's, when Nabisco merged with the R.J. Reynolds tobacco conglomerate to become RJR Nabisco and began trimming costs and sold the plant, former employees said. In 1991, the large bronze main doors closed forever. A few years later, the doors themselves were stolen.
Now, rail tracks come to a dead end at an empty loading dock. Clocks on different floors are stopped at different hours. In the high-ceilinged basement, echoes bounce cathedral-like through a forest of more than 100 soaring concrete columns. "This is where they used to teach you how to drive a forklift," said Arcangelo Formichelli, the factory's 63-year-old watchman, who ran printing presses there from 1957 to 1990.
Upstairs, he walked across the broad wooden floor of the cutting and creasing room, then pointed to the spot where women once put the little red strings on the boxes of Animal Crackers shaped like circus railroad cars. Near the workers' entrance, he paused by a row of lockers covered in peeling paint, saying, "This one was mine."
He said it was tough to watch a building that was so important to the community slide into disrepair. "This place bought me two houses and helped me raise six kids," he said.
He professed no familiarity with modern art, certainly not with the works of some of the artists in the Dia collection, like the earth-filled rooms of Walter De Maria.
But that did not matter, he said. "One way or the other," Mr. Formichelli said, "it'll be great to see this building open up again."

HEADLINE: Brazilian Economist Killed In Waldorf-Astoria Attack

BYLINE: By GINGER THOMPSON 

 BODY:
The man killed Saturday at the Waldorf-Astoria was identified yesterday as a well-to-do Brazilian economist who ran agricultural projects in the Amazon rain forest, owned a popular antiques store and traveled the world several times a year, the police and his relatives said.
The victim was Joao Saboia, 56, a resident of Belem, a city on the northern coast of Brazil. His throat was slashed and his face was badly cut and bruised, the police said. They refused to provide details about Mr. Saboia or the circumstances of his death, but in a telephone interview from Belem, his nephew Carlos Saboia, 32, said the police told relatives that about $50,000 was missing from the hotel room. 
 "He traveled all over the world, at least five times a year," Carlos Saboia said. "But he really loved New York. That makes this even more sad, because it happened in his favorite city."
It was not unusual for Mr. Saboia to travel with a lot of cash, his nephew said. He said his uncle had stopped in New York on his way to Atlantic City, where he was well known as a high-stakes gambler and was often invited as a special guest by casino managers.
"The police told us that whoever did this had a fight with my uncle and then took everything," Carlos Saboia said. "They said that they did not know who did it, but that it could have been someone who works at the hotel."
Joao Saboia (pronounced joh-OW sah-BOY-ah) was single and had no children, relatives said. His eldest brother died of cancer two months ago. "We were trying to recuperate from my father's death, and now this," Carlos Saboia said. "We are just in total shock. Everyone loved my uncle."
Relatives described Joao Saboia as a "very influential economist," and they said that he and his staff advised corporations interested in establishing farming or industrial projects in the Amazon.
Carlos Saboia said the police told the family that they discovered Mr. Saboia's body about 5:30 P.M. Saturday after travel companions reported that they had not seen him for several hours. When officers went to his room, a "Do Not Disturb" sign was hanging on the door.
Relatives also were told that this was the second attack within a year at the Waldorf-Astoria, visited by the world's most prominent dignitaries and long a symbol of New York's opulence.
Last June, a 37-year-old guest was injured in a stabbing by a homeless youth he had invited to his room.
Police officials said they had no suspects in Mr. Saboia's killing and had made no arrests. An operator at the hotel said the manager would not speak about the incident.
Mr. Saboia's relatives are scheduled to arrive in New York tomorrow -- with free accommodations offered to them by the Waldorf-Astoria -- to discuss the slaying with the police and hotel officials. "We want to know what happened," Carlos Saboia said.
Guests at the hotel expressed shock about the killing in their midst.
"I was worried about walking last night to make a show," said Sue Schmitt, of New Albany, Ind., who spent Saturday evening at "The Phantom of the Opera." "But I guess I was really safer on the streets than I was in the hotel."
She and her daughter Julia had come to New York to celebrate Julia's 13th birthday. "It's really scary," Julia said, referring to the killing. "I had nightmares all night."
In the lobby bar yesterday, Kathy and Bob Foster of Dallas seemed to shrug off the incident after hearing about it from a reporter.
"We tend not to worry about things," said Mr. Foster, 77, decked out in a pinstripe suit with a striped tie and matching handkerchief. "When you're old, most people are really nice to you."

HEADLINE: How the U.S. Can Do Right by Central America;
Stability in Salvador

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Although the relative peace of El Salvador's recent presidential election is indeed worth celebrating (news articles, March 8 and 11), long-term stability there will require solution of the country's underlying economic difficulties, not just the casting of ballots.
In a 1998 epidemiological study by Physicians for Human Rights, my colleagues and I found that the living conditions of many beneficiaries of postwar land distribution programs are little better than those of prewar landless peasants, with a high prevalence of childhood malnutrition. 
 As long as poverty continues to affect a large portion of the Salvadoran population, the risk of recurrent civil strife cannot be discounted, and human suffering will persist.

HEADLINE: In Angler's Freezer Since '62, Fish May Refute 'Extinction'

BYLINE: By PAM BELLUCK 

DATELINE: CONNEAUT, Ohio

 BODY:
Call it nostalgia. Or sentimentality. Or call it an uncanny prescience.
Jim Anthony himself is not exactly sure why he kept a certain fish in his freezer for 37 years, carefully re wrapping it every so often and making sure that his wife did not let it thaw every time she defrosted the freezer. 
 Somehow, Mr. Anthony, a 63-year-old barber in this working-class town on the shores of Lake Erie, had a feeling when he caught the fish, a blue pike, back in 1962, that someday somebody might be interested.
"I kept telling my wife it was more valuable as time went on and that's why we needed to keep it," Mr. Anthony said. "It's hard for me to explain, but that blue pike meant a lot to me."
All of a sudden, nearly four decades later, Jim Anthony's blue pike means a lot to other people, too. It has become the central clue in a compelling scientific detective story, one that some scientists hope will have an extraordinary ending: the return of an extinct species.
Blue pike, native only to Lake Erie, were once so prevalent there that they spurred a booming commercial fishing industry in the 1930's and 1940's, catering to demand for the mild, meaty taste of the bright blue fish. But in 1975, blue pike were declared extinct, a casualty, scientists say, of pollution, over-fishing and habitat changes.
Since then, fishermen have occasionally reported seeing what looked like blue pike in smaller lakes in Canada and elsewhere. Some Lazarus-like resurrection? More plausible was the theory that during the blue pike heyday, people transferred small batches of fish from Lake Erie to smaller lakes and they never died out.
Still, fish biologists generally assumed that those blue fish were really a type of walleye, a common fish in Lake Erie, and not the true blue pike. But they could not be sure. They could find no specimens of blue pike preserved in such a way that DNA could be extracted and compared with the DNA of other fish.
And they were intrigued by the possibility that blue pike still existed.
"If we could find and verify the survival of the blue pike, then we could restock them in Lake Erie," said Dieter N. Busch, a fishery biologist who helped spearhead the research as chief of the Lower Great Lakes Program of the United States Fish and Wildlife Service.
Mr. Busch said blue pike had been sorely missed, both for environmental reasons (it filled an ecological niche as one of the few Lake Erie fish to spawn in deep water) and economic reasons (he estimates that the return of blue pike to their previous levels would add more than $150 million to the lake's fishing industry).
"The species was such a valuable species," Mr. Busch said, "it was worth getting an answer."
Research was going slowly. Scientists had blue pike from museums, but they were preserved in formaldehyde, which makes DNA hard to extract. They had scales from blue pike used in unrelated earlier studies, but that DNA was disappointing, too.
Fortunately for science, Mr. Anthony, while snipping hair, chatted to customers about "the blue pike generation." That was the golden age of blue pike, when Mr. Anthony's father sold piles of them from his fish markets in Conneaut (pronounced KAHN-yaht) and popularized the "fish sandwich without bones." After school, Jim pulled on rubber boots and got down to scaling and cleaning fish.
Mr. Anthony, a burly, self-effacing man who worked as a fisherman for his father until the blue pike population started to dwindle in 1957, told his barber shop customers about the 15-inch blue pike he caught with a simple hook, line and night crawler in 1962. Even then, he knew the fish was rare and kept it alive in a bucket while he contacted state wildlife agencies. He offered them the fish but they declined. One agency suggested he release it back into the lake, and he tried, but it was already too weak and died.
Mr. Anthony's wife, Mary Lynn, accepted the fish preservation routine graciously, realizing it was important to her husband. Sometimes while defrosting the freezer, she either moved the fish to another freezer or piled frozen foods on top of it.
"All my customers knew I had a blue pike in my freezer," Mr. Anthony said in his white ranch house not far from the great lake. "They thought I was nuts."
One day last year a customer brought him a local newspaper article about scientists trying to determine whether any blue pike still existed. Mr. Anthony called one of the scientists, Carol A. Stepien, an ichthyologist, or fish zoologist, at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland and offered up his fish.
"It don't look bad for 30-something years in the freezer," Mr. Anthony said. "Except for a little freezer burn."
Dr. Stepien was more concerned with what was on the inside.
As it turned out, "It has great DNA," she said. The research "would be very difficult without his fish."
Dr. Stepien's crew is proceeding systematically, first trying to determine whether the original blue pike is in fact a separate species from the walleye. If the two fish are too closely related, then the walleye might have interbred with the last of the blue pike, making it unlikely that any original blue pike still exist.
Dr. Stepien says she will not disclose her final conclusion until a scientific conference in May. Mr. Busch, however, who now works for the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission, is bolder.
"We are confident that blue pike are a separate species," Mr. Busch said.
The next step, he said, is searching for "suspect blue pike" in various lakes (so far, there have been rumors of blue pike in Ontario, Minnesota, Pennsylvania and Tennessee). Fishermen have sent putative blue pike to Dr. Stepien and to the Fish and Wildlife Service, but the DNA of those fish will not be tested until the first phase of the project is complete. Mr. Busch even has a fish someone sent him eight years ago that he says has telltale signs of blue pikeness: a pointy nose, large eyes and a smaller size than a walleye.
"When I unwrapped it, my stomach jumped," Mr. Busch said. "I have seen hundreds of walleye and this was different."
If the scientists find living blue pike, they will focus on ways to reintroduce them to Lake Erie. The lake is cleaner now, but there would have to be an adequate food supply -- the lake herring the blue pike ate tapered off decades ago and Mr. Busch said they might have to restock that, too.
All of this is somewhat controversial with some fishery managers and the fish and wildlife agencies in the states with a border on Lake Erie: Ohio, Pennsylvania and New York. They are concerned that before any fish is reintroduced, there is solid proof not only that the fish are blue pike, but that they will not interbreed with walleye or invade the walleye's habitat.
"We would love to have them back, but we want the original ones and that's the key," said Roger L. Knight, supervisor of the Sandusky Fish Research Unit of the Ohio Division of Wildlife. "You can build false hopes and there may be pressure to stock blue fish in Lake Erie, even if we're not sure they are the original blue pike. We're not about to introduce another strain of walleye into our lakes where our walleye are doing fine."
Mr. Anthony knows the investigation could take years, but he is hopeful it will find that the fish of his childhood is still around somewhere.
He winces to recall the waning years of the blue pike, when the fish his father's workers caught contained no eggs or eggs that were deformed.
After he caught his blue pike in 1962, the year after his father died, he tried to conjure up ways to keep the breed from disappearing.
"Every time I'd meet a politician, I'd say, 'Just get me permission to set a net and catch some blue pike and try spawning them in holding tanks,' " said Mr. Anthony, who could no longer set nets because he had given up his commercial fishing license. Later, Lake Erie commercial fishing was banned for a while because of mercury.
"Maybe they didn't think blue pike was really going to die out," Mr. Anthony said, "but I couldn't understand why they weren't doing anything about it."
Since he bequeathed his frozen blue pike, Mr. Anthony has visited Dr. Stepien's lab a couple of times.
"It might sound corny, but I had a lot of feeling in that fish -- it's a part of my life," he said. "Now, they call it the 'Anthony fish.' I like that."

HEADLINE: Fleet Financial to Buy BankBoston in $16 Billion Stock Deal

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY L. O'BRIEN

 BODY:
Fleet Financial Group plans to acquire the BankBoston Corporation for $16 billion in a deal that will create the eighth-largest bank in the country and the pre-eminent bank in New England, the companies said yesterday.
The new bank, which is to be based in Boston and will be called the FleetBoston Corporation, will have such a stranglehold on consumer accounts in states like Massachusetts, according to lawyers specializing in banking law, that Federal antitrust law will require large sales of bank branches there and elsewhere in New England. 
 The transaction will most likely involve a significant number of job cuts and layoffs throughout New England, anywhere from 2,500 to 5,000, according to people involved in the deal, though the exact number of job cuts could not be determined. Fleet and BankBoston now employ about 50,000 people combined.
If shareholders and regulators approve the deal, the merged bank will still lack the heft necessary to join the ranks of the nation's new banking titans that have been created by a wave of mergers. With about $178 billion in assets, the new FleetBoston will remain a quarter to half the size of Citigroup, the BankAmerica Corporation, the Chase Manhattan Corporation and the Bank One Corporation. That raises the possibility that the new bank could be involved in another big merger in the next few years.
The boards of both banks approved the deal after meeting yesterday afternoon.
The banks renewed discussions about a merger about six weeks ago. Earlier talks fell apart last year.
Fleet will exchange 1.1844 of its shares for each BankBoston share, valuing BankBoston at about $53 a share, or about a 15 percent premium above BankBoston's closing price on Friday of $46.9375 a share. Shares of Fleet rose 12.5 cents on Friday, to $44.75. Both issues trade on the New York Stock Exchange.
BankBoston shares have been trading well below their 52-week high of $59.0625 because of investor concern about the bank's heavy exposure to volatile economies in Brazil and Argentina. BankBoston executives have repeatedly noted that the bank turned in a record performance in Latin America last year and that they expect to make a substantial profit in the region this year, too.
Even so, a combination with Fleet will further insulate BankBoston from financial problems related to any economic downturns in Latin America.
Last year, Fleet had operating earnings of $1.6 billion on revenue of $7.14 billion. BankBoston posted operating earnings of $792 million on revenue of $4.4 billion in 1998. The merged bank will have about 20 million customers.
"I think that, execution issues aside, this might be a terrific deal," said Diane Glossman, an analyst with Lehman Brothers. "They have strengths in divergent areas, and if they combine correctly they could have significant opportunities to boost revenue."
Terrence Murray, the 59-year-old chairman and chief executive of Fleet, is to be chief executive of the merged bank for the next two years.
After that, Charles K. Gifford, the 56-year-old chairman and chief executive of BankBoston, will succeed Mr. Murray as chairman of the merged company.
Fleet, which grew rapidly through a series of mergers from its original base in Providence, R.I., has 1,200 consumer branches reaching as far south as New York and is the country's sixth-largest commercial lender. It is also one of the biggest mortgage lenders in the country.
Fleet also owns Quick & Reilly, the nation's third-largest discount brokerage firm, and provides investment management services for both individuals and institutional clients, with more than $74 billion in assets under management. It also own the AFSA Data Corporation, one of the largest processors of student loans.
Last year, Fleet bought a large credit card portfolio from the Advanta Corporation, but recently sued Advanta, contending that Advanta overstated the value of that business. Fleet says that Advanta did not disclose coding errors that resulted in excessive interest charges of at least $3.9 million, which Fleet had to repay. Advanta has said that the lawsuit has no merit.
Fleet's mix of businesses has been criticized by analysts and advisers as something of a hodgepodge, but the bank has focused more closely recently on performance and turned in strong results last year, when many other banks had difficulty meeting earnings goals. Its credit card and commercial lending businesses did particularly well last year.
BankBoston, which has a blue-chip, Brahmin lineage, has a well-regarded management team and has been praised as a friendly, supportive company for employees, with relatively little turnover among its work force. It has also established a strong record on community outreach programs.
Last year, however, was a difficult one for BankBoston. It was buffeted by trading losses, the untimely and expensive acquisition of the Robertson Stephens investment banking firm and a financial scandal involving millions of dollars stolen from its private banking division. The downward pressure on its stock had made the bank a more vulnerable takeover target.
BankBoston has a charter dating from 1784 and once numbered Paul Revere among its clients. The bank is an unusual hybrid of old-fashioned banking, corporate lending and stock underwriting, married to extensive Latin American operations.
About 20 percent of BankBoston's profits come from its Latin American operations; the bulk of the bank's profits, about 67 percent, come from its corporate banking and regional banking businesses.
BankBoston's consumer banking business has been hobbled by problems related to the acquisition of Baybanks three years ago, a situation that Fleet and BankBoston must avoid if they want to integrate their operations successfully.

HEADLINE: Training for a Presidential Race

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE with RICK LYMAN 

DATELINE: AUSTIN, Tex.

 BODY:
He is the early favorite for the Republican Presidential nomination, but even Gov. George W. Bush of Texas concedes that his foreign policy experience goes no farther than Mexico. Kosovo? Not even on the radar screen. And he has never had to worry about the future of Social Security.
Rushing to fill in his blank slate on pressing issues of the day before the campaign swings into full gear, Mr. Bush has embarked on a cram course that could be titled "What you need to know to run for President." 
 After winning a second term last November, Mr. Bush began summoning dozens of the nation's brightest thinkers around a table in the Governor's Mansion for sober-minded tutorials. Politicians in both parties said they had never seen such a comprehensive and elaborate undertaking, particularly this early in a campaign. There may never have been a "serious" candidate who needed it more.
The endeavor is intended to counter what are widely seen as among Mr. Bush's biggest vulnerabilities: that he lacks experience beyond Texas and that he has not articulated a grand view of what he would do in the White House. It was no accident that in their announcement speeches last week, Elizabeth Dole and former Gov. Lamar Alexander of Tennessee emphasized their credentials on national issues.
Mr. Bush's visitors defended the Governor as a quick study. "Nobody knows everything about what goes on in the world, so you've got to find out," George P. Shultz, Secretary of State under President Ronald Reagan, said recently as he sat back in his rocking chair with a State Department seal at his office at Stanford University, where he is a fellow at the Hoover Institution.
Mr. Bush's ability to draw big names -- all of whom, in the beginning, paid their own way to Austin -- is not simply testament to the Governor's personal appeal or skills at outreach. Self-interest is at play as well: Academics like to be asked for advice, particularly by a politician who is leading in the polls and who might someday be in a position to appoint them to something. What for Mr. Bush is a tutorial might serve as an audition for his tutors.
There is also the prestige factor. "They come back and say, 'Well, I was just down in Austin,' " said Martin Anderson, an economist at Stanford University and an official in the Reagan Administration. Participants have been plucked from around the country, but there is particularly heavy representation from the Hoover Institution.
Al Hubbard, an Indianapolis business executive who coordinated the early meetings for Mr. Bush, said people were invited to Austin "under the condition that they would be supportive of him" and all but one person accepted.
The deep conversations about policy are all the more surprising because -- fairly or unfairly -- Mr. Bush is known more for his hands-on governing style than for his intellect. He has never been known for savoring the minutiae of policy like President Clinton. "Having known George as a student, I'm shocked, and his professors would be shocked," said Mr. Hubbard, a classmate of Mr. Bush at the Harvard Business School. "He wasn't a great student. But he's the most conscientious politician I've ever worked with."
Lawrence B. Lindsey, a former member of the Federal Reserve Board who was on President Reagan's Council of Economic Advisers and is Mr. Bush's chief outside economic adviser, described him as "a very good and patient student."
The sessions started informally after the election and they have become more organized in the past few months. Besides Mr. Lindsey, who invites economic experts to the meetings and structures the agenda, Mr. Bush has named Mayor Stephen Goldsmith of Indianapolis to preside over domestic policy, while Condoleezza Rice, the provost of Stanford University, oversees foreign and military policy.
The meetings are often convened in a formal, deep blue dining room in the Governor's mansion, and sometimes in a smaller, sunny conservatory. They usually include just over half a dozen experts in a field and are scheduled for three hours but often last longer.
To all but the most devout policy wonks, the conversations can be eye glazing. According to an agenda of a health care briefing that Mr. Goldsmith presided over on Feb. 18, six minutes were allocated for introductory remarks and 25 minutes for a discussion of the financing system and the delivery systems, with such topics as "trends in patient care: acute to chronic conditions, diffusion of technology, rise of pharmaceutical therapy."
Then a 30-minute discussion of philosophy, including "What level of care are we prepared to guarantee?" Then 50 minutes on the uninsured, and 50 minutes on the "anxious insured." Mr. Goldsmith was to close with a 20-minute review of matters for further discussion.
Several participants said in interviews that the discussions were framed less around how the Governor should respond to a particular question on the campaign trail and more around how he would tackle the matter as President.
"It's more like a very interactive seminar than people sitting around giving formal talks," Ms. Rice said. The Governor, she said, "is not somebody who puts on airs or attempts to appear imperial, so there's a kind of easiness about the conversation. Sometimes you get a bunch of foreign policy experts together and they talk on a plane where nobody asks the basic questions. He'll drive you back to the basic question."
When the end of the cold war came up, she said, Mr. Bush asked: "What does America's role really mean to you? What did we mean when we talk about the expansion of NATO? What is the military of the future going to look like?"
In conversations about economics, participants said, Mr. Bush always returns to job creation. "What can I do to make higher paying jobs?," said John B. Taylor, an economics professor at Stanford. "That's a bottom line for him."
The experts said Mr. Bush appeared confident and did not pretend to know more than he does. Like Ronald Reagan, Mr. Anderson said, "He has no problem talking to people who were smarter and quicker. There are other candidates who don't like to do that."
While they described Mr. Bush as smart and disciplined, many participants said he obviously still had a lot to learn.
"He still has some growing to do," said Michael Boskin, a Stanford University economist and former chief economic adviser to President George Bush who organized some of the early meetings. "But he's become the most impressive Presidential or potential Presidential candidate that I've seen in decades."
Seeking to portray himself as more conservative than his father, Mr. Bush has stayed clear, at least publicly, of many of the former President's top advisers. Even after hours of meetings, several participants who know his father were hard-pressed to distinguish their philosophies.
Asked if the Governor was more conservative than his father, Mr. Shultz said, "Out of the blue I would say that. But then if you said, 'Why?' I wouldn't have a good answer."
The visits have ignited a firestorm of gossip in academic and political circles about how people are angling for posts in a Bush Administration. But participants said the preening is kept to a minimum, though experts sometimes compete over who brings the most colorful graphics. "You could think about the jobs available: budget director or Treasury Secretary or national security adviser. I haven't participated in lists of names of who would be good for things," Mr. Taylor said. Referring to Mr. Bush, he added: "I don't know if he's done that. He's probably thought about it."
Though Mr. Bush's visitors do not dare speculate openly about their futures, they clearly delight in the attention. When Ms. Rice, a national security official in President Bush's Administration, was shown an editorial in the Stanford University student newspaper with the headline, "Secretary of State?" she gasped, "My God!"
Moments later, Ms. Rice, who is stepping down as provost, retreated to a position of studied nonchalance. "Certainly, nobody's asked me to be Secretary of State," she said. "And I'm a terrible long-term planner."

Yields at 3-Week Lows, With Favorable Inflation News Seen

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
Treasury bond prices rose for a second day, pushing yields to the lowest in almost three weeks, as investors bet that economic reports this week will point to subdued inflation and slowing growth.
"The market's going to see some good news," in the reports this week, said Alan Day, who helps manage $4 billion at Stratevest Group in Burlington, Vt. "There's no threat of rising rates of inflation."
The price of the 30-year Treasury bond fell 2/32 , to 96 1/32 . The bond's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 5.52 percent, from 5.51 percent Friday.
Trading volume was the lightest this year, according to GovPX Inc., a bond pricing service.
Traders and investors will be paying close attention to February figures on industrial output, due today, and consumer prices, the most widely watched measure of inflation, to be released Thursday. Economists expect production to be unchanged and prices to rise just one-tenth of 1 percent.
"After weeks of relentlessly strong data, we have the prospect of some softer economic reports," said Dana Johnson, the head of research at First Chicago Capital Markets Inc. "That'll put a positive underlying tone to the fixed-income market."
Gains in Treasuries may be limited as expected bond sales by the AT&T Corporation and the Peco Energy Company draw investors' attention from Treasuries, traders said.
AT&T is preparing to sell as much as $6 billion of bonds in coming days in what would be the second-largest corporate issue ever.
Results of yesterday's Treasury auctions of 3-month and 6-month bills:
 
(000 omitted in dollar figures)

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS;
Dow Climbs 82.42 Closer To 10,000 as Nasdaq Rises

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN 

 BODY:
Stock prices rose sharply yesterday, swept higher by a couple of big merger announcements, enthusiastic buying of technology shares and an optimistic earnings forecast from UAL, the nation's biggest commercial airline company.
The advance pushed two major market measures -- the Dow Jones industrial average and the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index -- to new records. 
 Although the Nasdaq composite index failed to set a new high, it was the session's best-performing index.
Even small stocks, which have done dismally this year, had a good day.
"Given what has been happening in the U.S. economy, you have to be very positive on the market," said Jack Shaughnessy, the chief investment strategist at Advest Inc.
The Dow Jones industrial average closed up 82.42 points, or 0.8 percent, at 9,958.77. Despite the run-up, the Dow never seriously challenged the 10,000 mark. In the session, it rose as high as 9,970.15. Still, it was the first time the blue-chip index had closed above 9,900, and eclipsed its previous high of 9,897.44, set on March 11.
"In my view, the 10,000 level for the Dow is largely an irrelevancy," said Peter Canelo, a United States investment strategist at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter. "The key drivers for the market are a tremendous economy without any inflation."
Meanwhile, the S.& P. 500 rose 12.67, or 1 percent, to 1,307.26. That gain passed the previous record of 1,297.68, which was also established on March 11.
Strong buying of technology and Internet shares powered the Nasdaq index to a gain of 49.91, or 2.1 percent, to 2,431.44. And the Russell 2000 index of small-company stocks gained 2.46, or 0.6 percent, to 400.84.
Two big merger deals -- Fleet Financial's acquisition of BankBoston and DuPont's takeover of Pioneer Hi-Bred International -- were important positives.
While BankBoston only gained 1/8, to 47 1/8, and Fleet lost 2 9/16 , to 42 3/16 , the deal refocused attention on consolidation in the financial services industry and pushed the prices of a number of big institutions sharply higher.
Merrill Lynch gained 4 7/16 , to 91 11/16 , on rumors that Chase Manhattan might be looking to acquire the nation's biggest brokerage firm. Chase lost 3/4, to 87 1/4.
J. P. Morgan, a Dow component and a company that in the past was mentioned as a possible takeover candidate, was the best-performing part of the blue-chip index yesterday, rising 3 3/8 , to 125 3/8 .
Meanwhile, Pioneer Hi-Bred, the world's largest seed-corn company, rose 4 1/16 , to 38 3/8, after it was announced that DuPont had agreed to buy the 80 percent of the company it does not already own for about $40 a share in cash and stock.
DuPont was the worst-performing component of the Dow, falling 1 1/2, to 56 1/4.
The earnings announcement from UAL, which said it expected first-quarter earnings to exceed expectations by 24 percent because of strong domestic business, powered the entire airline sector higher.
UAL, the parent of United Airlines, gained 6 11/16 , to 73 3/4; US Airways rose 2 7/8, to 55 3/8; AMR, the parent of American Airlines, jumped 3 3/4, to 61 3/4, and and Delta Air Lines rose 5, to 69.
The gains helped to push the Dow Jones transportation average up 4.2 percent. Even with the big rise, that index is still trading almost 8 percent below the peak it set in April 1998.
Given the strength in the economy, Mr. Canelo from Morgan Stanley Dean Witter said that first-quarter earnings could well be strong across a wide swath of industries.
"I don't feel the consumer is slowing down at all," he said. "That should be a positive for the overall economy and should lead to strong earnings across the board, with the exception of some basic industries and energy, which will suffer due to tough comparisons from a year ago."
In technology, Netscape Communications rose 6 1/8, to 91. It was announced on Friday that America Online had won antitrust clearance from Federal regulators to complete the $8.98 billion acquisition of the top maker of Internet software. America Online rose 5 7/8, to 102.
Among large-capitalization technology companies, Microsoft gained 5 11/16 , to 165 7/8; Dell Computer rose 1 9/16 , to 43 3/4, and EMC jumped 41/16 , to 116 5/16 .
TheStreet.com's Internet sector index rose 36.83, or 6.5 percent, to a new high of 604.83.
"These stocks look expensive, but they have looked that way since they were trading at half of what they are now," said Michael Molnar, a managing director in retail sales and trading at Salomon Smith Barney.

HEADLINE: Medicare Panel Chief Doubts He'll Find Votes for Change

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 15

 BODY:
The chairman of a bipartisan commission studying the future of Medicare made a last-ditch effort tonight to salvage his proposal for radical changes in the health insurance program for the elderly, but he said he did not know if he could round up the necessary votes in time for the panel's final meeting on Tuesday.
Moreover, the chairman, Senator John B. Breaux, Democrat of Louisiana, said President Clinton had given him no assistance in trying to get those votes. Mr. Breaux needs support from at least one of the President's four appointees on the 17-member commission, but Mr. Breaux said he had not secured support from any of them. 
 "Do I wish the President had come out and endorsed this proposition?" Mr. Breaux asked. "The answer is yes. Am I disappointed if he doesn't? The answer is obviously yes."
Under Mr. Breaux's proposal, the Government, instead of paying separately for each medical service, would offer a fixed amount of money to each beneficiary. The beneficiary could use the money to buy private health insurance, through a managed care plan, or to enroll in the traditional fee-for-service Medicare program.
The commission, which was created by a 1997 law plans to vote on Tuesday on its final recommendations to insure the long-term solvency of Medicare. The panel has gone two weeks beyond the March 1 deadline for its final report. Medicare is expected to run short of money just as the first of 76 million baby boomers turn 65, in 2011.
Administration officials and liberal Democrats in Congress predict that the commission will end its work with 10 members supporting the Breaux plan and 7 opposed. Under the law that created it, the commission needs 11 votes for any recommendation to the President and Congress.
To win support from Democrats, including Mr. Clinton's appointees, Senator Breaux is proposing to offer Medicare coverage of prescription drugs as a new benefit. The Government would pay all the costs of such drugs for people with incomes up to 35 percent above the official poverty level (incomes up to $10,568 a year for an individual and $13,334 for a couple).
Health maintenance organizations and other private health plans would have to offer drug coverage to Medicare beneficiaries, but they could charge extra. The original fee-for-service Medicare program would also offer prescription drug coverage, through arrangements with private insurers, but the Government would not subsidize the cost.
In purchasing drugs for millions of Medicare beneficiaries, Mr. Breaux said, the Government would pay "prices commonly available in the market, without recourse to price controls." Drug companies adamantly oppose price controls, saying they would choke off the revenues needed to finance research and reward investors.
Two of President Clinton's appointees -- Stuart H. Altman, a professor of health policy at Brandeis University, and Laura D'Andrea Tyson, former chairwoman of the President's Council of Economic Advisers -- have praised some features of Mr. Breaux's proposal, including its potential to save money by stimulating competition in the Medicare market. But they have also insisted that Mr. Breaux clarify many details of his plan.
Another Clinton appointee, Bruce C. Vladeck, the Federal official in charge of Medicare from 1993 to 1997, has led opposition to Mr. Breaux's proposal, saying it would shred the guarantee of health benefits for some of the sickest, most vulnerable people in America.
Representative Bill Thomas of California, the leading Republican on the commission, said he was disappointed that Mr. Clinton had stayed aloof from the panel.
"We have Republicans, we have Democrats," Mr. Thomas said. "We have members of the House, we have members of the Senate. We have members of the public, and we have members of the private sector all in support of this plan. The only group that hasn't given us one vote is the President's appointees."
White House officials responded today that although they had often consulted with the President's appointees, the commission members were free to vote as they chose on the proposals. And, the officials said, the White House will not comment until Mr. Clinton reviews the panel's final report.
Mr. Breaux and Mr. Thomas said they would translate the Breaux plan into legislation and try to push it through Congress this year, regardless of whether it is formally endorsed by the commission.
The plan is supported by all eight Republican members of the commission and by two Democrats, Mr. Breaux and Senator Bob Kerrey of Nebraska.
Mr. Breaux's plan would gradually raise the eligibility age for Medicare, to 67 from 65, over 24 years, from 2003 to 2027. People age 65 or 66 who could not obtain private insurance would be allowed to purchase Medicare coverage under rules to be specified in the future, Mr. Breaux said.
His proposal would also extend provisions of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 that curbed the growth of Medicare payments to doctors, hospitals, home health agencies and nursing homes.
The staff of the commission estimated that Mr. Breaux's plan would not produce significant savings in the first five years, but would save a total of $100 billion from 2005 to 2009. Then, it said, the savings would gradually increase, so that in 2030, Medicare spending would be $600 billion less than now anticipated: $1.6 trillion, rather than the $2.2 trillion envisioned under current law.

HEADLINE: El Paso Energy to Buy Sonat, Creating Gas Pipeline Giant

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: HOUSTON, March 15

 BODY:
The El Paso Energy Corporation agreed today to buy a rival, Sonat Inc., for $3.9 billion in stock and $1.9 billion in assumed debt, creating the largest interstate natural gas pipeline company in the United States.
El Paso will exchange one of its shares for each share of Sonat. The transaction values Sonat at $35.75 a share, a 32 percent premium to its closing price of $27.125 on Thursday, the day before the company's stock started to rise on speculation about the purchase. 
 The deal will let El Paso expand in the electricity business without merging with a utility, as other gas companies have done, analysts said. Sonat's pipelines provide gas to fast-growing markets in the Southeast, including Florida. El Paso, based in Houston, can build gas-fired power plants along those lines. Sonat is based in Birmingham, Ala.
"El Paso is getting pipelines in an area it doesn't have them now, which should provide a good platform to continue their power plant projects," said Mark Easterbrook, an analyst at Dain Rauscher Wessels.
The bid comes a month after the Southern Company in Atlanta, the largest publicly traded United States power company, ended talks to buy El Paso. Those talks fell apart after the chairman of El Paso, William Wise, demanded to be chief executive of the new company when Southern's chief executive leaves, people close to the negotiations said.
In an interview, Mr. Wise said the purchase would save $60 million a year beginning in 2000. Some jobs will be cut after the acquisition, though Mr. Wise did not give specific figures. El Paso will take a charge of $200 million to $300 million before taxes to account for some of the costs of the deal.
The companies said the acquisition would raise earnings and cash flow of the combined entity in 2000, the first full year of the merger.
The high premium that El Paso is paying is an indicator of how strongly El Paso wants to stay independent, analysts said. Buying Sonat makes El Paso big enough to fend off hostile bids, said Michael Barbis, an analyst with Warburg Dillon Read.
Shares of El Paso fell $3.6875, or 10.3 percent, to $32.0625, as investors reacted to the size of the bid. Sonat fell 43.75 cents, to $29.625.
Mr. Easterbrook suggested that one reason shares were falling was that investors were worried about the financial prospects of Sonat's oil and gas exploration business.
Earlier this month, Sonat said it would take a first-quarter charge of about $200 million, or $1.81 a share, to write down the value of reserves because of low oil and gas prices. Inflation-adjusted oil prices have been at their lowest levels since the Great Depression most of this year.

HEADLINE: Spending by Insurers Pushes Albany Lobbying to Record

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD J. LEVY 

DATELINE: ALBANY, March 15

 BODY:
An unsuccessful bid by life insurance companies to loosen regulations on their industry helped to push spending on lobbying in the Statehouse to another record last year, according to a report issued today.
Over all, expenditures by lobbying clients increased by 7 percent last year over 1997, to $55 million, the report by the Temporary State Commission on Lobbying said. 
 The New York Life Insurance Company, in what was believed to be a record for a lobbying campaign in Albany, poured more than $1.8 million into its effort to change state regulations that restrict the ability of some life insurance companies from selling off a partial ownership stake to stockholders.
The Metropolitan Life Insurance Company came in fourth in the commission's rankings, spending more than $600,000.
Neither of the insurers was in the top 10 in lobbying expenditures in 1997, the commission's records showed.
The two insurance companies, as well as some smaller rivals and an industry trade group, were lobbying last year in support of insurance legislation proposed by Gov. George E. Pataki. The bill died after opposition by the Democratic majority in the State Assembly, which contended that it would allow the life insurance companies to sell stock without adequately compensating insurance policyholders.
Bill Werfelman, a vice president at New York Life, said a sizable part of its lobbying expenses went for advocacy advertisements intended to muster public support for the legislation.
"It's safe to assume that this was a special circumstance for New York Life," Mr. Werfelman said, noting that the company was no longer pursuing the legislation and expected its lobbying expenses to plummet this year.
Besides the spurt in spending by the life insurance industry, the report by the commission showed that health care groups, trade associations, labor unions and banks continued to dominate spending on lobbying, which has generally risen at more than the rate of inflation over the last two decades.
The figures without a doubt underestimated the efforts to influence the state government, largely because the definition of what constitutes lobbying is hazy. Some clients choose to report rigorously any spending relating to the state government, including money allocated for items that might also be considered public relations or legal work. Others hew to a less strict definition. Moreover, under the law, clients do not have to report expenditures for lobbying on state contracts.
And the report today did not mention the other weapon in the arsenal of interest groups: campaign contributions. For example, the state teachers' union, which perennially is in the top five in lobbying expenditures, has given roughly $300,000 a year since 1995 to the campaign committees run by the legislative leaders. That is on top of an annual average of $650,000 that the union has spent on lobbying, state records showed.
As in 1997, the top two lobbying firms were Wilson, Elser, Moskowitz, Edelman & Dicker, whose chief lobbyist is Kenneth Shapiro, a former senior aide to the Assembly Democrats, and Davidoff & Malito, whose activities in Albany are led by Robert Malito, who has close ties to the Republican majority in the State Senate.
Both firms are also major campaign contributors.
The biggest increase in business was reported by Albert J. Pirro Jr., whose lobbying fees rose 53 percent, to more than $550,000. Mr. Pirro, the husband of Jeanine F. Pirro, the Westchester County District Attorney, was indicted last month on Federal tax charges. He has pleaded not guilty.
As lobbying commission members released the report, they once again requested that the Legislature tighten the state's lobbying rules, a call that was echoed by a coalition of advocacy groups.
The law authorizing the commission expires this year, but lawmakers have repeatedly rebuffed proposals to give the commission permanent status and more enforcement power, and to require lobbyists to disclose more information about their activities.
"We ask our state leaders to act favorably upon our legislative proposals," said the panel's chairman, Bartley F. Livolsi, "so that the commission can cross the bridge into the next millennium equipped and prepared to monitor 21st-century lobbying."

HEADLINE: Democrats Pick '00 Site: Los Angeles

BYLINE: By DON TERRY 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, March 15

 BODY:
Evoking the glories and the ghost of John F. Kennedy, the Democratic National Committee announced today that it would hold its national convention here in the summer of 2000.
In coming to Los Angeles for the first time in 40 years, the Democrats are hoping that history will repeat itself. In 1960, John F. Kennedy, then a senator from Massachusetts, won the Presidential nomination here and went on to become an icon. 
 The city's selection had been widely known since last week, so today's official announcement was a time for the people who brought the Democrats to town to take a bow.
The newly elected Democratic Governor of California, Gray Davis, said the convention and the state's new earlier primary would help give California "unrivaled clout" and show that "Los Angeles is back, having weathered riots and recession, floods and fire."
Eli Broad, a billionaire businessman and a leader of the effort to bring the convention to the city, said it would create jobs and pour $150 million into the city's economy.
The Republican Mayor of Los Angeles, Richard J. Riordan, was beaming about the prospect of so many Democrats coming to town.
"Democrats are almost as good as Republicans," Mayor Riordan said after the news conference. "Right now, I'm in love with the Democrats for picking Los Angeles."
Joe Andrew, the national chairman-designate of the Democratic National Committee, said Los Angeles was selected for several reasons, including the "vibrancy and diversity of the people" and the election of Mr. Davis, the first Democratic governor in California in 16 years. Mr. Andrew added that Mayor Riordan, "a man who has reached across the divide of partisan politics," had also played a major role.
Finally, Mr. Andrew said, Los Angeles was selected because of a partnership among business, politicians and civic leaders.
Convention organizers say the private sector is committed to providing $28.1 million of the $35.3 million cost of the convention.
"The citizens of California," Mr. Andrew said, "will get the benefit and not the burden."
The convention will be held at the new 900,000-square-foot Staples Center, which is to be completed this fall. The center is downtown, a few blocks from Skid Row, which was crowded with homeless people today.
Bob Erlenbusch, executive director of the Los Angeles Coalition to End Hunger and Homelessness, said he did not expect the convention to have much economic impact on the people who live so close to Staples Center. During the 1984 Summer Olympics and the Pope's visit four years later, Mr. Erlenbusch said, there were countless "horror stories" of homeless people being swept off the streets by the police.
The Rev. James M. Lawson Jr., a leader of the civil rights movement and now the pastor of the Holman Methodist Church near the convention site, said there was no doubt that some ordinary people would get jobs because of the convention.
"But the convention will not effect any long-term change in Los Angeles," Mr. Lawson said.
But Joel Kotkin, a senior fellow at the Pepperdine Institute for Public Policy, said the coalition that helped bring the convention to Los Angeles was an example of a new direction for the city.

HEADLINE: One of 2 Teams in Genome-Map Race Sets an Earlier Deadline

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS WADE 

 BODY:
The date for completing the first draft of the human genome, the three billion units of DNA held in every human cell, has been moved up to the spring of 2000, the publicly financed consortium sponsoring the work announced yesterday.
If met, the new date set by the consortium -- the National Institutes of Health, the Energy Department and the Wellcome Trust of London -- could allow the public venture to claim some measure of victory over its commercial rival, the Celera Corporation of Rockville, Md. Celera, headed by Dr. J. Craig Venter, has said it will produce a substantially complete, accurate human genome sequence by the end of 2001. 
 Dr. Venter said in response to yesterday's development that he had not changed his goals and that the public consortium's announcement had "nothing to do with reality."
"It is projected cost, projected timetables," he said.
Until the formation of Celera last May by the Perkin-Elmer Corporation, an instrument-making company based in Norwalk, Conn., the public consortium had aimed to finish the complete genome by 2005. Then, in the fall, the consortium said it could crank out a first draft of the genome by December 2001. The new target cuts even that ambitious goal by some 18 months.
The genome sequence is expected to become the nucleus of medicine, because it represents the programming for the human organism. Most diseases are caused to varying extents by bugs in this programming, which are the mutations that affect each individual's genetic endowment.
Participants on both the public and private teams believe that the intense competition between them has forced faster progress than if either team were working by itself.
"If we lose that pressure, we wouldn't be seeing such good reciprocity between the public and private efforts," said Dr. Richard Gibbs, head of the sequencing center at the Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, who works with the consortium's team.
Referring to the pressure that Celera's mere existence has created for the genome efforts of the National Institutes of Health, Dr. Norton Zinder, biologist at Rockefeller University and a member of Celera's board, said, "The Venter-Hunkapiller initiative will cause the DNA of the human genome to be made available from the N.I.H., without Celera's having to do a line of sequence." Dr. Michael W. Hunkapiller is the Perkin-Elmer executive responsible for design of the company's widely used DNA sequencing machines.
The draft that the consortium says it can complete by the spring of next year is intended to reflect all human genes, estimated to number about 100,000, and most of the long intervening stretches of DNA that lie between them. Much of the genome is in the form of repetitive sequences that are hard to decipher and have no known functional significance because they are not part of the genes. Such regions that are not completed now will be done later.
Almost 60 percent of the genome will be sequenced by the national institutes' university-based centers, 10 percent by the Energy Department's laboratories, and 33 percent by the Sanger Center near Cambridge, England.
The Federal Government's share of the human genome project was intended to cost $3 billion over 15 years. But Dr. Francis Collins, director of the institutes' part of the project, said the actual amount spent on production-scale sequencing would be much less. He expects the international consortium's cost of preparing the draft sequence to be $280 million or less, comparable with Celera's costs.
Until now, the national institutes have financed eight university-based centers to generate human DNA data. But Dr. Collins announced yesterday that new money would be focused on the three most productive centers, those headed by Dr. Robert Waterston at the Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis, Dr. Eric Lander at the Whitehead Institute in Cambridge, Mass., and Dr. Gibbs at the Baylor College of Medicine in Houston.
The new focus may give the institutes' decentralized system a helpful edge in competing with the monolithic but nimble Celera. Dr. Lander said economies of scale were readily apparent in centers that had 100 of the latest-model DNA sequencing machines, a capacity that is to be reached soon by the Sanger Center, Washington University's and his own.
An early test of strength may come with Celera's pilot project, that of sequencing the entire genome of the Drosophila fruit fly, a standard laboratory organism. Dr. Venter, Celera's chief, said he hoped to complete the sequence in three to six months.

HEADLINE: China's Premier Stresses Cooperation for U.S. Visit

BYLINE: By ELISABETH ROSENTHAL 

DATELINE: BEIJING, March 15

 BODY:
Less than a month before he leaves for a state visit to the United States, the blunt-speaking Prime Minister of China, Zhu Rongji, laid out his agenda today for what promises to be a turbulent trip, saying the two nations would continue to cooperate despite renewed friction on issues ranging from human rights to charges that China stole nuclear secrets.
"Of course it will not be easy for me to go to the United States in such an atmosphere," Mr. Zhu said at a news conference. But he quickly added: "My goal is to let you vent your anger and complaints and to tell you the truth -- and to regain the momentum of building a strategic partnership between China and the United States." 
 In an unscripted 90-minute meeting with reporters after the adjournment of Parliament, Mr. Zhu covered a range of topics including plans to open his country's markets further, the arrest of pro-democracy advocates and China's unyielding opposition to a proposed regional missile defense system that could potentially include Taiwan.
None of the positions presented by Mr. Zhu were entirely new, although some fresh tidbits were offered, like China's willingness to relax restrictions on foreign investment in its banking sector. More important, the news conference marked the first time that many positions had been stated directly by a top Chinese leader.
And Mr. Zhu's casual style made the serious conflicts percolating between the two nations seem more like spats between old friends.
In the last six weeks, the United States Congress has accused China of stealing American nuclear secrets, trying to illegally import military hardware from the United States and violating a United Nations Human Rights Covenant it signed just last year.
Mr. Zhu acknowledged that relations between Beijing and Washington had lost "momentum" since President Clinton's ebullient state visit to China last summer.
But his underlying theme, that the two nations could cooperate despite their considerable differences, echoed that of Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright when she visited Beijing last month. And in general, Mr. Zhu's statements were more measured than recent Chinese Government pronouncements, which have lambasted the United States as "hypocritical" on human rights and denounced spying charges as fabrications by enemies of China.
The news conference was broadcast live, just after China's Parliament approved a host of reports and constitutional amendments sponsored by the Communist Party.
While Parliament inevitably passes such motions by huge margins, debates at committee meetings have become increasingly lively. And the meeting this year provided some unusual excitement as two Government reports on China's legal system presented a frank picture of widespread abuse and corruption. A constitutional amendment that elevated the status of the private sector was at least a symbolic victory for China's emerging business class.
But it was Mr. Zhu's meeting with reporters that carried the day. His chief portfolio is economic reform, but the session today provided a glimpse of how he handles foreign relations, less familiar waters that he will have to navigate in the United States.
Mr. Zhu scoffed at the spying charges that have riveted both the United States Congress and media: that a Taiwan-born scientist passed on secret information enabling China to modernize its nuclear arsenal. The charges both underestimate the American Government's ability to keep secrets and Chinese scientists' ability to make discoveries, he said.
"China is fully capable of developing any military technology," he said. "It's only a matter of time."
He said the charges had grown out of "internal struggles in the United States." Evoking the McCarthy era in the United States and the Cultural Revolution, he warned that both countries had known "periods where everyone was afraid of being accused by everyone else, and we should never forget that."
Mr. Zhu's mood turned more serious as he discussed proposals for the United States and Japan to build a missile defense system for East Asia that might eventually include Taiwan. He dismissed American news reports that China has 600 missiles trained on Taiwan. "How could they know that?" he said. "Even I don't know that!"
Fifty years after Chinese Nationalist forces fled to Taiwan, Beijing still regards the island as a renegade province and American military aid there as interference in China's internal affairs.
Mr. Zhu also rehearsed answers to the human rights questions that will certainly come up during the trip next month. Although Chinese officials have long insisted that human rights policies are strictly internal affairs, Mr. Zhu expressed what appears to be at least a superficial willingness to hear opposing views.
"We welcome foreign friends criticizing us in our work, but don't be impatient," he said, noting that he has grown accustomed to "friends from abroad pulling out lists" of pro-democracy activists whom they want released from jail.
But as Mr. Zhu briefly lit into such activists, it was clear that the two sides shared little common ground. "Don't support these so-called pro-democracy activists," he said, warning that they would bring neither democracy nor rule of law to China.
On economic policy, he reiterated that the Government would not devalue its currency and would no longer prop up insolvent companies.
He talked of China's renewed eagerness to get into the World Trade Organization this year. American and Chinese officials are now negotiating furiously to this end, in the hopes that even a embryonic deal will provide a happy note to what many expect could be a dissonant visit to America.
Mr. Zhu suggested that China would be willing to open its telecommunications and banking sectors somewhat to gain admission -- a tantalizing prospect for foreign investors -- though he refused to go into details.
He said that after years of discussion, the two sides had recently made substantial progress, although differences remained. "The black hair has turned gray, and it's time to conclude these negotiations," he said.

HEADLINE: Gore Offers a More 'Livable World' With Some Tinkering

BYLINE: By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE 

DATELINE: DES MOINES, March 15

 BODY:
Vice President Al Gore began laying out a platform today for his all-but-announced Presidential candidacy, appealing to harried suburbanites and promising to create a more "livable world."
Mr. Gore offered a continuation of President Clinton's policies, with only minor tinkering. He said, for example, that he wanted to hire enough teachers to reduce the size of classes in all grades through high school, not just through eighth grade as Mr. Clinton has proposed. He also said that he wanted to make preschool education available in all public schools. 
 But he did little to separate himself from his political benefactor today as he took one more step in his long, slow march toward a Presidential candidacy by taking his first official campaign trip, paid for by his election committee. He is not expected to announce his candidacy officially until later this year.
"I want to build on the wisdom that we've all gained in the last several years," he said at a rally in snowbound New Hampshire before flying here, paying homage to the two states that vote the earliest in the primary process.
Mr. Gore put special emphasis on what he calls quality-of-life issues -- easing traffic congestion, for example -- that some have ridiculed as un-Presidential because they are local issues, but that he defends as integral to strengthening families by creating more free time. They are also aimed squarely at an important bloc of swing voters, especially frazzled parents, who live in the suburbs and could decide the next election.
"The person who deserves to be our next President is the one who understands how tired working parents are," Mr. Gore said.
"We're seeing the daily commutes get longer and longer," he said. "And for people who don't think that it's a problem that parents are caught in traffic jams that are lengthening each day, I'll tell you, they haven't been in traffic jams and they don't know what it does to the desire to balance work and family."
He referred to the cultural battles that his wife, Tipper, fought over obscene song lyrics and said, "The V-chip is just the beginning." As he told a crowd of about 100 people here, "Let's be sensitive to the problems that real families have."
In an apparent response to criticism that he has focused too exclusively on upscale suburbanites, he made a pledge today on behalf of women and minorities. Citing the commitment of his late father, a Senator, to civil rights and of his mother to women's independence, he vowed to carry those crusades into the next century.
For all of Mr. Gore's identification with the Clinton Administration, particularly the nation's economic prosperity, he seemed quite ambiguous about how strongly to associate himself with it. He did not mention Mr. Clinton by name, and he seemed to want to create distance by describing not a policy divide but an epochal divide -- a natural break in the calendar in the year 2000 that would leave Mr. Clinton in the past and put Mr. Gore in the future.
"It's not only the beginning of a new century and a new millennium," Mr. Gore said. "It's the beginning of a whole new era in human history." He said that posed a new set of challenges with "new approaches for the new century."
Mr. Gore has spent years building up an extensive financial, political and policy network across the country, and that in-place apparatus has gone a long way toward clearing the field of primary challengers.
Today he was accompanied by Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, the House Democratic leader, who formally endorsed him in what the two billed as a strong sign of party unity. Bill Bradley, the former Senator from New Jersey, is the only Democrat who has entered the race, and the polls strongly favor Mr. Gore over him for the party's nomination.
But the polls are less encouraging for Mr. Gore in hypothetical match-ups against various Republicans, suggesting serious vulnerabilities in the Gore candidacy. The latest NBC/ Wall Street Journal poll showed him 18 points behind Gov. George W. Bush of Texas and 15 points behind Elizabeth Dole, the two leading Republicans.
Judith Hope, the Democratic chairwoman in New York, last week openly questioned whether Mr. Gore would be the party's best nominee, noting that Democratic Vice Presidents who have sought the Presidency have tended to lose.
Mr. Gore's media consultant, Bob Squier, said that Mr. Gore was flagging in the polls because he was still being perceived as Vice President. "He is not thought of in Presidential terms," Mr. Squier said, suggesting that campaign forays like today's, which drew the biggest press contingent of Mr. Gore's tenure, would start to change that perception.
Mr. Gore sidestepped questions about whether he was too closely linked with the impeached President. He said the campaign would be about ideas, not polls.
But Gore aides admit that he is using a series of narrowly focused, poll-tested initiatives, reminiscent of some of Mr. Clinton's micro-proposals in 1996, to appeal to voters.
With Mr. Clinton off in Central America last week, the Vice President used the empty stage of the White House almost every day to discuss topics including traffic jams, drug labels and lost bags at airports.
Aides even imitated the Clinton strategy of targeting their announcements to certain media venues to insure maximum, and sympathetic, exposure. For example, at last week's announcement on ways to ease traffic congestion, they invited traffic reporters, those who ride the choppers and describe road conditions. This guaranteed the Vice President media coverage in local markets across the country and on drive-time radio, much as Mr. Clinton in 1997 insured heavy attention for his conference on global warming by inviting more than 100 local weather forecasters to cover it.
Republicans have poked fun at Mr. Gore for directing a Presidential campaign to such seemingly small issues as lost bags at airports and such seemingly local issues as traffic congestion. Jim Nicholson, chairman of the Republican National Committee, has been particularly scathing, accusing Mr. Gore of trying to "do away with the internal combustion engine, the automobile," and calling him "an apologist for the President; he's a wasteful dreamer."
Even an airline passenger, Jim Corsetty of Rockville, Md., whose plane was stranded on a runway and who found himself on stage with the Vice President last week, expressed his astonishment that he had become an anecdote in the Presidential campaign. He introduced the Vice President as "my own personal consumer advocate."
But some Republicans think Mr. Gore might be on to something.
Bill McInturff, a Republican pollster who is working for the Presidential campaign of Senator John McCain of Arizona, said that even if Mr. Gore was talking about "microscopic" issues and sounded as if he were running for town manager rather than President, he was still controlling the policy debate.
"It's working," Mr. McInturff said with some exasperation. "You're writing a story about Gore talking about lots of popular issues. But have we really so dumbed down the office that he can be talking about traffic?"

HEADLINE: Washington's Mayor Urges Moving Its Public University, Creating Furor

BYLINE: By MICHAEL JANOFSKY 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 15

 BODY:
Taking on an issue today that has always exposed the gulf between haves and have-nots in the nation's capital, Mayor Anthony A. Williams proposed moving the University of the District of Columbia from its current campus in northwest Washington near embassies and expensive homes, to Anacostia, the poorest section of the city.
While Mr. Williams suggested that the move would promote economic development in its current and proposed sites, the idea sparked instant and widespread outrage from people who insisted that it reflected an overwhelming insensitivity to the needs of low-income blacks, who regard the university as a viable way out of neighborhoods that have been ravaged by crime and drugs. 
 "Everybody is upset about this; it's awful," said Lawanda Johnson, a U.D.C. senior who attended Mr. Williams's news conference today. "People are fighting to get away from places like Anacostia. Where we go now is a way out. We don't want to go back to look at crime."
Many said the proposal would primarily benefit real estate developers who might buy the property. Mr. Williams disputed that contention, saying he was committed to keeping the university open and thriving.
The University of the District of Columbia was created 22 years ago as the city's version of a state university and an alternative for high school graduates who cannot afford more costly private institutions and for older students who work full-time. In the early years, the university's curricula expanded to accommodate almost any major imaginable, whether aviation or gospel singing, in an effort to help students earn a college degree. But the city's financial troubles in the early 1990's forced a scaling back that reduced course offerings and fueled speculation that city leaders would prefer to close a university in a predominantly white neighborhood that serves a student body that is mostly black.
Through it all, defenders of the university have contended that the need for a low-cost institution of higher learning, similar to those available to state residents, offers city residents the best chance to overcome generations of poverty. They also say the university's location has reflected a symbolic assurance that city leaders regard its students with the same respect accorded those attending private universities in the city, like George Washington, Georgetown, American, Catholic and Howard.
Campaigning here for mayor last year, his first bid for elective office after several years as the district's chief financial officer, Mr. Williams supported those perceptions and promised to keep the University of the District of Columbia as a four-year institution even though the undergraduate population fell by nearly half, to 5,029 this year from 9,179 in 1996 because of budget cutbacks.
In January, he vowed to appoint a commission to recommend improvements, and today he said the budget would include $1 million to examine the feasibility of moving the campus "to match the needs of the anticipated revised mission and to spur economic development" in Anacostia.
But the idea of moving the university, which evolved without consulting current university officials, caught the city by surprise, angering many who said the proposal reflected a larger scheme, to marginalize the university for the benefit of real estate tycoons who could make a fortune developing the property.
At a news conference today, Mr. Williams said he was committed to helping the university thrive. But as part of his first budget announced today, which reflected priorities of education and economic development, he proposed selling the university and using tax revenues from new businesses at the current location to support a new campus in Anacostia as a way to spur economic development there.
"We have to boost U.D.C. up to a higher level of performance," Mr. Williams said. "We have to think how we can do that in the overall concept of better government."
Mr. Williams brushed aside questions that suggested his proposal reflected a political naivete on his part for wading into an issue that touches raw nerves involving class and race.
He responded by pointing out that many district residents questioned his political instincts when he was a mayoral candidate. Nonetheless, he easily won the Democratic primary last year and carried every precinct in the November general election, something his popular predecessor, Marion S. Barry Jr., never did. "I didn't get elected to adjust the air-conditioning," Mr. Williams said. "I was elected to make some changes."
And to those who questioned the timing of his proposal to appoint a commission to study the university's future, after he had already determined where the future should lie, Mr. Williams took a swipe at Mr. Barry, saying, "I think it's important to send a signal that this administration is ready to wade into areas where others have feared to tread."
While many other proposals in his budget suggested that other city agencies face changes, few packed the emotional wallop of the one concerning the university.
On campus today, many students said they were angered by the idea.
"Clearly, this is nothing more than another attempt to shut us down," said Diallo Sumbry, senior class president. "If you look at our history, we had our budget cut by 50 percent, then they wanted to sell the school."
Lenox Yearwood Jr., the university's director of student life and a 1994 graduate as well as a former student government president, said: "It is racist at the core. They systematically dismantled our budget, faculty, and morale. This is back-door politics at its best.
"How would Georgetown students feel if we told them to leave their home?" Mr. Yearwood asked.
That view was shared by university leaders, past and present. Roger Wilkens, a history professor at George Mason University in Fairfax, Va., was a trustee of the University of the District of Columbia from 1986 to 1991. He lives in Washington.
He said he was disappointed by Mr. Williams's proposal, arguing that young people who have grown up with crime, drugs and shabby housing need hope. "If you create a first-rate institution in a city, then you give parents and teachers the opportunity to say to little kids, 'Look up there on Connecticut Ave. Look at where you can go in life,' " he said.

HEADLINE: Tribes Weigh Tradition Against Growth of Casino Resorts

BYLINE: By BRETT PULLEY 

DATELINE: BERNALILLO, N.M., March 12

 BODY:
With muscular yet elegant curves, the Rio Grande winds its way through the Santa Ana Pueblo reservation. Stand along its yucca- and cactus-sprinkled banks and face north from the sacred Indian grounds where the Spanish explorer Coronado once trekked, and the Sandia Mountains seem to hang like gods in the sky to the east.
Look just to the west, and the only thing hanging in the sky is a giant neon star bearing the words "Star Casino." Next to the casino, little white golf carts zip over the reservation's 27-hole championship course. And just beyond that, construction is under way on an $80 million hotel, a spa and second golf course. 
 After using casino gambling over the past several years to help reverse their fortunes, American Indian tribes like this one are beginning to build entire leisure industries on their reservations. But as the easy-living aura of vacation resorts, gambling, golf and shopping spreads across the land that Indians have cherished for generations and worked to protect from outside intrusion, concern has been growing among tribal members that their religion, culture and sovereignty are being pushed aside.
"It's like a leisure virus," said Jose Lucero, a member of the Santa Clara Pueblo tribe, whose reservation is about 60 miles north of here. His tribe is divided over whether it, too, should develop a casino resort. "We're trading our souls for money," he said. "Some tribe members say: 'Hey, it's O.K. It's glamorous.' But that's not what we are supposed to be. We are supposed to be stewards of this land. And we're not very good stewards now, allowing all of this stuff to take over."
With the desperately needed jobs and money that casinos have brought to reservations, few people in the more insular tribes have been publicly critical of casino gambling on their reservations. But a once-faint drumbeat of disdain is growing louder. Critics worry that tourists will trample across what they consider to be religious ground, that the business partnerships that the tribes are forming are increasingly being operated by outside professionals and managers.
"Our religious leaders are more or less opposed to the casino and all these companies moving in here," said Otis Leon, a member of the tribal council that governs the Santa Ana tribe. But the medicine men and other protectors of the tribe's religion and culture, he added, "are getting pushed aside in a way."
Mr. Leon, who voted in favor of the casino development, now expresses mixed emotions. "Things seemed O.K. at first," he said. "But then more of the Las Vegas types started moving in."
Despite such concerns, it is difficult to argue against what appears to be progress. Of the 22 tribes across the state, 11 operate casinos and it is estimated that they take in more than $350 million a year in overall gambling revenue. And although there is still poverty on the reservations, jobs are now available, recreation centers and libraries have been built and major investments are being made to augment the success of gambling. Several tribes are expanding their casinos and planning hotels and vacation resorts, and the tribe leading the way is the Santa Ana Pueblo.
Two weeks ago, the tribe announced a partnership with the Hyatt Hotels Corporation to build what is being billed as "New Mexico's first major golf and spa resort." The 350-room resort hotel is to occupy a picturesque section of the 61,000-acre reservation, which is located 15 miles north of Albuquerque. The tribe will own the resort and Hyatt will manage it. Also, the tribe is doubling the size of its adobe-style Star Casino and adding a Las Vegas-style theater. A retail shopping center has been proposed for a nearby section of the reservation.
Thanks to the profit from its six-year-old casino, the Santa Ana Pueblo tribe is operating a four-star restaurant on the reservation, next door to its golf course and luxurious clubhouse. This year, the tribe will be host to golf tournaments including the United States Women's Amateur Public Links Championship and the PGA Western Club Championship.
As the tribal members who are leading the development boom see it, they are doing more than investing the casino's profits to increase economic opportunities. Facing obstacles like ongoing attempts by gambling opponents to have the casinos closed and a possible recommendation to Congress by the National Gambling Impact Study Commission that the casinos be taxed, the tribe says it is creating a leisure industry that can survive even if the casinos do not. "There are so many attacks on Indian casinos," said Roy Montoya, who as chief administrator of the 690-member tribe is in charge of all business development. "What the new resort represents is another step toward self-sufficiency."
Within the tribe, where most decisions are made by councils composed of men, the progression from subsistence agriculture to private business has created two camps. The traditionalists are leery of opening their boundaries to outside interests, and the business leaders like Mr. Montoya are pushing to expand.
As the profits from gambling began to add up, "we considered two approaches," Mr. Montoya said in an interview in his plain but comfortable office on the reservation. "Some people said: 'Stash the money. Don't do anything with it.' But we chose to put these different ventures in place."
The culture and religion, Mr. Montoya said, will be strengthened by the economic growth. "Our culture and religion was very strong when we got our subsistence from farming right here on the reservation," he said. "Then when the economy started changing and Dad had to go off the reservation to work, things got weak. But with jobs on the reservation now you have more time to spend with your family and in 15 to 20 years, the religion and culture will become stronger again."
The business-oriented tribal members seem to be winning. When the tribal council discussed the proposed Hyatt, some members bristled at building the resort just a half-mile from "The Snake Head," one of the reservation's ancient religious sites.
"But the business types said they needed that site next to the river, overlooking the mountains," said Mr. Leon, whose grandfather held the revered religious title of medicine man. The business interests prevailed. Mr. Leon said: "The religious people are upset with us. They worry that the public will wander over the reservation."
One plan for the Hyatt resort that might appease the religious leaders is a small museum with exhibits depicting the tribe's history.
 Two weeks ago at the Taos Pueblo reservation, 70 miles north of Santa Fe, tribal leaders approved a plan to buy a nearby hotel and meeting center and move the tribe's casino to the site, which would become a part of the tribe's reservation. But not everyone is happy about the growth. Jerome Marcus, a 38-year-old member of the tribe and former security officer at the casino, said that as the casino has prospered he has witnessed a slow deterioration of tribal values. "I've noticed a complete lack of participation in ceremonies and understanding by our people, especially with diversions like the casino," he said.
Still, the benefits from the development are evident in the opportunities that have been created.
Recently, at the Isleta Pueblo reservation, 10 miles south of Albuquerque, Aaron Dailey, a 16-year-old tribal member, was busy washing golf carts at the lush golf course just across State Highway 47 from the tribe's casino. Although he has been playing golf less than three years, Aaron already carries a 10 handicap and the golf professionals operating the course have high hopes. "The tribe is trusting us to come in and operate their business enterprises and train their people," said Brent Townsley, a teaching professional at the course. "But our goal is to see someone like Aaron take this course over and become the head pro."
Nevertheless, the phalanx of corporate interests, lawyers, accountants, casino managers and investment advisers who swirl around the reservation is unnerving to some. "They're taking a lot of the control of the economic development on the reservation out of the hands of the tribe itself," said Tim Giago, a syndicated columnist and member of South Dakota's Oglala Lakota tribe. "I'm amazed that many of the tribes have turned into what they've deplored all their lives. They're bureaucracies and they're being run by attorneys and accountants -- white attorneys and accountants."
But Roy Montoya appears to be in control of the Santa Ana businesses. One day recently, he walked into a closed-door meeting of casino executives to have a word with the casino's general manager. Minutes later, he was at the reservation's planning offices, interrupting another meeting of architects and developers who all popped to their feet, smiling broadly. "We own everything, 100 percent," Mr. Montoya said. "All of these people are on contract, just like out in the rest of the world."
Mr. Montoya oversees a staff of more than 400 employees, and in two years, when current development projects are complete, that number is projected to reach 700 -- more employees than tribal members. "When I started this job in '84 I had nine employees and I was just called Roy," said the 58-year-old Mr. Montoya. "Now people call me sir. But I'm still Roy."

HEADLINE: Traveling Companion Is Sought In Killing at the Waldorf-Astoria

BYLINE: By ANDY NEWMAN 

 BODY:
Investigators are seeking the traveling companion of a Brazilian economist who was found murdered Saturday in his room at the Waldorf-Astoria, a police official said yesterday.
A hotel surveillance videotape shows the companion entering the economist's room with him hours before the body was discovered and then leaving the room alone some time later, said the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. 
 The 56-year-old victim, Joao Saboia, used to introduce the man as his nephew, but they were not related, the official said. He has probably fled the country and returned to Brazil, the official said, adding that the police had notified the authorities there to look for him.
About 5:30 P.M. on Saturday, after Mr. Saboia had missed an appointment to meet friends, the police found him with his throat slashed and his head bruised, with a possible skull fracture. His family has said $50,000 that Mr. Saboia had been carrying was missing.
Mr. Saboia's family has said that he was a high-stakes gambler who frequented Atlantic City and often traveled with a lot of money. Mr. Saboia, a resident of Belem in northern Brazil, had planned to attend Saturday night's Holyfield-Lewis heavyweight title fight at Madison Square Garden.
The death was believed to be the fourth homicide in the 68-year history of the Waldorf-Astoria, at Park Avenue and 49th Street. It was also the second attack within a year. Last June, a 37-year-old guest was injured in a stabbing by a homeless youth he had invited to his room.

HEADLINE: Clinton to Offer Debt Relief Plan for Poor Nations

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 15

 BODY:
President Clinton will propose extensive debt forgiveness on Tuesday for some of the poorest nations, agreeing to relieve repayment obligations of some countries in Africa and other regions if they enact broad reforms, Administration officials said today.
Mr. Clinton is to announce the program during a meeting here of African finance and foreign ministers. 
 But it will require approval by Congress, other donor nations and multinational institutions like the International Monetary Fund. Those negotiations could easily take a year or more. The fund has traditionally been reluctant to endorse such programs for fear they breed expectations among borrowing nations that if they wait long enough, they will not have to repay their loans.
But pressure has grown to provide relief to countries that must commit huge portions of their budgets to repayment, leaving little for education, health care or basic services.
While details are vague, the plan would expand the number of countries that could benefit from debt forgiveness to nearly 50, from 41. Countries like Ghana, Congo, Laos and Honduras could benefit, but only if they met certain economic targets that have yet to be set.
American officials said the United States is willing to forgive debts of more than $3 billion if other donors -- who are owed nearly $70 billion -- agree. But the impact on the Federal budget, the White House said, would be less than $200 million. While the accounting is complex, most of the debts have been written off as uncollectable, so the added cost to the Government of full forgiveness is considered relatively small.
While the Administration has often spoken of debt forgiveness for countries moving toward reform, it has never before proposed a broad change in the rules.
Part of the proposal calls for the I.M.F. to sell part of its gold reserves, given to it more than 50 years ago when the fund and the World Bank were formed. Interest from investing the proceeds of that sale could be used to pay off some of the money owed to the fund. Past calls to sell the gold have been in vain.

HEADLINE: A Project 30 Years in the Making;
Durst Tries to Revive Father's Dream, Decades Later

BYLINE: By CHARLES V. BAGLI 

 BODY:
More than 30 years ago, Seymour B. Durst set his sights on a dingy block at the eastern edge of Times Square.
He dreamed of bulldozing the transient hotels, tenements and decrepit buildings to make way for skyscrapers on 42d Street, between Broadway and the Avenue of the Americas. Pedestrian plazas would wind between the towers and old Broadway theaters in a modern version of Rockefeller Center. But when landowners set their prices sky-high and a recession struck in 1973, Mr. Durst abandoned his dream and with it, much of his drive to be a New York developer. 
 Even as the Avenue of the Americas has become a canyon of corporate skyscrapers and Times Square has been made safe for Disney, this block, from 42d to 43d Streets, has hardly changed. But now, Mr. Durst's son, Douglas, a taciturn 55-year-old, stands closer than even his father did in 1970 to developing this haunted stretch and carving his own name into the New York skyline.
He controls about 85 percent of the block. He is completing a 1.6 million-square-foot tower on state-owned land at the western end and has plans for a $650 million, 50-story tower for the rest of the block, possibly for the newly combined Nasdaq and the American Stock Exchange.
But first, he, like his father, must contend with four other landowning families whose lives have crisscrossed the block for three decades. It is a part of the age-old struggle between a developer and holdouts in New York that has earned a place in the city's culture through cartoons, songs and even a 1965 Broadway musical, "Skyscraper." Its history is replete with not only the economic vagaries that can undo real estate projects but also the feuds and scandals that wreak just as much havoc.
"It's a fascinating story," said Gordon McCollum, a retired real estate broker who played a role in the block's tortured history. "The block encapsulates everything about New York real estate. It's a real drama."
His father's role in that historical drama is very much on the mind of Mr. Durst. "I would like to complete something he started," he said. "It's a spot that itches, that you're always trying to get to."
This is a block where apple orchards gave way to pawnshops, the Times Square Bathhouse for Women, the Hotel Diplomat, Toffinetti's restaurant, the Xenon discotheque, Jimmy Glenn's Times Square Gym and Peepalive, a live sex show.
In recent months, Mr. Durst has renewed talks with the four other landowners. The Brandts own what used to be called the Pix Theater, one of 150 movie theaters the family once operated up and down the East Coast. Joseph Bernstein and his family, which had their own dreams of building office towers and hotels on the block, own three parcels on 42d Street and a fourth on the Avenue of the Americas.
Susan Rosenberg owns the small building at the southwest corner of 43d Street and the Avenue of the Americas where her late father, Harry Goldberg, opened a pawn shop in 1948. And finally, there is Richard M. Maidman, who owns the Remington Building, a dingy 19-story building that is vacant except for Fun City, a pornographic video store opened in the 1970's.
After three decades of on-again, off-again negotiations, they are like sumo wrestlers wrapped in headlocks, but unable to take down their opponent. Every owner wants to be the last in line to make a deal on the theory that that will get the highest price. But city and state officials have said they will condemn the block if the Nasdaq commits to moving there, a threat that could bring all the parties to the bargaining table.
"I get calls all the time from people who want to buy," said Ms. Rosenberg, who recalled that her father admired Seymour Durst, though the two never did cut a deal. "When there's something serious, we'll see what happens."
Seymour Durst, who died in 1995, first landed on the block in 1967, buying a building that was home to White's Sea Food Restaurant, which served a great clam chowder and dinner for $6. After developing office towers along Third Avenue in the 1950's, he jumped to the dowdy West Side, where land was cheap and ripe for development.
He would become known both inside and outside real estate circles as something of a philosopher, a man who enjoyed writing letters to editors and who stuffed his East Side town house with more than 10,000 books, maps and prints on city history. He also won some notoriety for erecting a neon sign on the Avenue of the Americas that still displays the national debt, second by second.
"His philosophy was that patience made a great investment," Mr. McCollum said. "It was almost artistic the way he would assemble these plots."
Seymour Durst eventually put together 10 acres between 42d Street and 47th Street from Broadway to the Avenue of the Americas for his grand vision of 10 soaring towers over a revived Times Square. On 42d Street itself, he had acquired much of the block, or negotiated deals to buy out his neighbors, including Mr. Maidman and the Brandts.
"I've walked 1,000 miles to assemble some sites," he said at the time. "I go back and then back again to a prospective site, sometimes every day, for that's a way to get to know the area and to talk with people in it."
But in 1973, overbuilding and a recession forced him to give up his dream. He lost a $400,000 deposit on the Maidman parcel and blamed holdouts for soaring land prices and the lack of progress in Times Square.
"It was a bitter disappointment to him," Douglas Durst said. "He became increasingly negative on development."
Over the next 22 years, Seymour Durst would build only two more office towers: 1155 Avenue of the Americas and the United States Trust Building, 114 West 47th Street.
Other developers had no more luck in developing the block. Robert Campeau, the mercurial Canadian tycoon, bought several parcels in 1981 and offered Mr. Durst $60 million for his property. But Mr. Campeau then lost interest in building an office tower and offered to sell his land for $11 million to the Bernstein brothers.
The deal came up as Joseph and Ralph Bernstein bought a development site from Seymour Durst at what is now 1177 Avenue of the Americas. They offered the Campeau land to Seymour Durst, who declined, offering instead to lease them all his property. The Bernsteins promptly hired architect I.M. Pei to design a 72-story tower with 2 million square feet.
But at the last moment, Mr. Durst scuttled the 42d Street deal, after news reports disclosed that the Bernsteins had acted as agents for Ferdinand Marcos, the Philippine dictator who looted his country's treasury to buy New York real estate. The Bernsteins never forgave Mr. Durst.
In 1987, it looked like the Dursts would jump back into the development game. Douglas Durst negotiated a tentative deal with Morgan Stanley to build a headquarters for the investment bank. It was going to be his first solo project since joining his father in the early 1970's, despite Seymour's advice to the contrary. A week later, the stock market crashed. "They called me the next day saying the world had changed; the project was dead," Douglas Durst said.
In 1990, a similar deal between the Dursts and the Chemical Bank also collapsed. Little happened on the block until 1995, when Douglas Durst opened negotiations with city and state officials about building what became 4 Times Square, the 48-story tower that will be home to Conde Nast Publications and the Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom law firm this summer. With the city still reeling from a recession, the project seemed a daring, even foolhardy, move by the usually conservative Durst family.
It was a stunning turnabout for the Dursts, who had long opposed the proposed office towers in the Times Square project. They had argued that these subsidized skyscrapers would compete with their own buildings and stifle development in the area. Yet after a decade of legal wrangling, it was Mr. Durst who would build the first tower.
"That was very bold," Mr. McCollum said. "I don't think his father would have ever made that move. I think Douglas has a more modern touch."
But it may take more than that for Mr. Durst to complete a deal on the remaining two-thirds of the block. The developer has met separately with each landowner, though no one is willing to discuss the talks.
For Mr. Durst, there are a thousand and one calculations, both economic and political. The more he pays for the land, the higher the rents he must charge and the less likely he is to find a tenant. He needs to sign a deal with a tenant to show he is serious, but no tenant wants to sign a contract without being certain the developer can deliver the land. The Nasdaq has indicated it wants to make a deal on 42d Street. Mr. Durst has also talked to Pfizer and PriceWaterhouseCoopers.
At the same time, the Giuliani administration has encouraged Mr. Durst to develop a 2 million-square-foot tower and a 1,500-seat Broadway theater, according to real estate executives involved in the project.
City and state officials have said they are willing to use the condemnation process to assemble the block for the Nasdaq, a threat that would eliminate the need for protracted negotiations but could spark a long court fight from Mr. Maidman.
Mr. Durst and Mr. Maidman have tangled recently at the Board of Standards and Appeals, where Mr. Durst has opposed Mr. Maidman's request for a variance to drape a 14,250-square-foot sign on his 19-story building. Mr. Maidman says he needs the money, while a lawyer for Mr. Durst, Irving Gotbaum, contends that the landlord is "only trying to boost the value of the property in anticipation of a sale."
Mr. Maidman set his price at a deal-breaking $20 million, quadruple the amount paid for two parcels Mr. Durst acquired last year. One executive at the Durst Organization suggested that Mr. Maidman might be seeking revenge on Mr. Durst because he believed the developer double-crossed him on a parking lot deal in the 1980's.
In the end, Peter R. Hauspurg, chairman of Eastern Consolidated Properties, a real estate consultant who has represented the Bernsteins since 1985, said he believes there will finally be a deal for the block, but not without more Sturm und Drang over at least one of the cutout parcels remaining on the block.
"I expect the pieces to fall into line at this point," Mr. Hauspurg said, "although I doubt that Richard Maidman will settle until Douglas is actually pouring concrete around Richard's cutout."

HEADLINE: LEADING SENATORS DEMAND U.S. LIMIT HELP FOR BEIJING

BYLINE: By ERIC SCHMITT 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 15

 BODY:
Influential Senators threatened today to block the Clinton Administration's leading diplomatic effort to improve fast-deteriorating relations with China, and they urged the suspension of some scientific exchange programs.
Jesse Helms, a North Carolina Republican, and Ernest F. Hollings, a South Carolina Democrat, said they would move to stop any effort by the White House to help China become a member of the World Trade Organization this year, reflecting Congressional anger over President Clinton's response to suspicions that China stole nuclear secrets. 
 And the Republican chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, Richard C. Shelby of Alabama, urged the President or Energy Secretary Bill Richardson to put a moratorium on visits by scientists from countries like China and Iran to American national weapons laboratories, and on reciprocal visits by American scientists to foreign installations.
"Our labs are not as secure as they should be," Mr. Shelby told reporters after an hourlong closed meeting with the director of Central Intelligence, George J. Tenet. "This perhaps is just the tip of an iceberg."
The Energy Department last week fired a Taiwan-born scientist at Los Alamos National Laboratory for security breaches, after the F.B.I. questioned him in connection with the suspected theft of nuclear weapons designs. Investigators say they believe that the scientist, Wen Ho Lee, gave the Chinese sensitive information on nuclear detonations during a visit there for a 1988 seminar. Mr. Lee has not been charged with any crime, but is the prime suspect in the case. Prime Minister Zhu Rongji of China scoffed at the spying charges, saying that his country is fully capable of developing nuclear technology on its own. Page A8.
Members of the House and Senate have criticized the Administration for not tightening security quickly enough and failing to keep Congress adequately informed about the seriousness of the possible breaches at Los Alamos.
David C. Leavy, a spokesman for the National Security Council, said tonight that the Administration would work with Congress to resolve the World Trade Organization issue, but he rejected Mr. Shelby's proposal. "There's no evidence the visitors' program has contributed to any damage to national security," Mr. Leavy said.
The double-barreled attack from Congress came as Mr. Richardson and Mr. Tenet, in separate closed briefings, tried to contain the political fallout from the Administration's handling of the spy case by explaining steps the Administration has taken to prevent thefts.
Mr. Tenet announced that a retired four-star admiral, David E. Jeremiah, would head an independent panel of experts to review the possible harm to national security resulting from suspected thefts that took place in the 1980's and were discovered by nuclear arms experts at Los Alamos in 1995. Admiral Jeremiah is likely to report by early next month.
But even as the Administration stepped up its defense of its response to the spy case, the White House took a body blow on its trade policy with China. The warning from Mr. Helms, chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, and Mr. Hollings, the ranking Democrat on the Commerce Committee, was issued in a letter sent to all senators.
"The continuing problems with Chinese human rights violations, espionage and possible technology transfers," they wrote, "suggest that this is not the appropriate time for China to enter the W.T.O."
Only two weeks ago, in Beijing, Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright assured China's leaders that the question of whether China was ready to enter the World Trade Organization -- a decade-long aspiration for China and a move that could prove enormously beneficial to the country's economy -- would be decided solely on commercial grounds. It would not hinge, she said, on China's human rights record or other issues.
But in recent weeks it has become increasingly clear that even if that is the Administration's plan, the atmosphere in Congress is rapidly changing. And Congressional approval will be necessary, because China's entry would require a major amendment of the law that allows Congress to review, each year, whether to extend "most favored nation" trading status to Beijing.
"This has become a poisonous issue," one of the President's top economic advisers said the other day. "And it could blow up the whole deal, if there is a deal."
The letter from Senators Helms and Hollings, which was reported in today's Wall Street Journal, mirrors conditions that the House Democratic leader, Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, has made and portends a tough fight for China to join the World Trade Organization this year.
Even as anger in Congress grows on the trade front, there is greater anxiety over security at Los Alamos and other national weapons laboratories. The labs had long resisted F.B.I. and Congressional pressure to tighten their security policies.
The Energy Department, which oversees the labs, has been lax in its supervision. The department, for instance, never filed a Congressionally required annual report in 1998 on the status of security at the labs.
Shortly after taking over as Energy Secretary last fall, Mr. Richardson learned of the urgency of the spy case and reinstated background checks on all foreign visitors, but it was a move the F.B.I. had recommended 17 months earlier.
Mr. Shelby was unmoved today, saying, "The President or the Energy Secretary should put a moratorium on the exchange of people coming into our labs, and our scientists going to their labs, and perhaps giving them information."
Senator Bob Kerrey of Nebraska, the Intelligence Committee's ranking Democrat, distanced himself today from Mr. Shelby's suggestion of a moratorium, saying, "It's not a situation where foreign visitors are the problems -- it's the employees."
The Energy Department, in a statement tonight, said rigorous screening and security measures were in place to insure that foreign visitors could not gain access to classified material.
But Mr. Kerrey expressed concern over security at the laboratories, even with the improvements Mr. Richardson has put in place, including doubling the counterintelligence budget.
"I no longer have any sense of security that we're doing the right thing," Mr. Kerrey told reporters after meeting with Mr. Tenet. "What I have right now is a considerable amount of nervousness over our counterintelligence efforts and their effectiveness."
As Senate Republicans pounced on the spy case as evidence that the Administration's policy of engaging China turned a blind eye to national security, a top Republican commentator, William Kristol, accused Congressional Republicans of hypocrisy.
"Republicans have largely supported the President and Sandy Berger on engagement and trade above all else in China," Mr. Kristol said today, referring to the President's national security adviser, Samuel R. Berger. "Ultimately, it looks like, hey, something hit the headlines and let's take advantage of it."

Bill Is Introduced To Give Tax Rebates

DATELINE: TRENTON

 BODY:
Legislation was introduced yesterday that would carry out a $1 billion property-tax rebate outlined by Gov. Christine Todd Whitman in January.
The bill, introduced by State Senator John J. Matheussen, Republican of Washington Township in Gloucester County, would reimburse families for school property taxes paid on their first $45,000 of income. 
 The program, which is expected to be signed into law by April 15, would be phased in over 5 years, resulting in a rebate check averaging $120 in its first year and $600 when complete, Mr. Matheussen said in a statement. He said the program would be paid for with increasing revenues resulting from the strong economy, and would not require an increase in the state income tax.

HEADLINE: Agency to List Pacific Salmon As Threatened

BYLINE: By SAM HOWE VERHOVEK 

DATELINE: SEATTLE, March 15

 BODY:
Federal officials will formally declare on Tuesday that nine wild salmon species in the Pacific Northwest are threatened with extinction, the first listing under the 26-year-old Endangered Species Act that affects an entire urban region, a Government official said.
But while that announcement deals with fish, it is people -- especially the three million in the greater Seattle area -- who will have to face the consequences of halting the decline of these once mighty salmon runs. 
 They will almost surely pay more in taxes, to acquire land around waterways and to buy out floodplains so rivers can reclaim areas where the salmon once spawned. They are already being urged by their local leaders to stop using fertilizers and pesticides, voluntary efforts that may eventually become mandatory, county officials said today. They will probably face sharp new restrictions on building, especially near streams and other waterways.
And at the heart of all these measures will be these questions: Will people decide that these are all steps toward a better quality of life in a region already consumed with worry that its lavish natural splendor is under attack? Will they find, as Mayor Paul Schell of Seattle likes to put it, that "in working together to save the salmon, it may turn out that the salmon saves us"? Or will listing the salmon as threatened species, which in many ways dwarfs the impact of the 1990 listing of the northern spotted owl that set off its own environmental controversy, provoke a backlash against the Endangered Species Act?
The law allows officials more time to develop protections for species listed as "threatened" than it does for those with the even more serious classification of "endangered."
 Officials from Gov. Gary Locke on down have been formulating plans for months in anticipation of the announcement, and they will now be forthcoming.
Under the Endangered Species Act, unless steps are taken to protect the affected species, governments and even private citizens can face criminal penalties. But so far, unlike the spotted owl fight, in which many leaders in logging and timber towns bitterly opposed the listing and even mocked the owl, there has been little opposition to the proposed listing. And no one is belittling the salmon, a symbol of the region.
The salmon species, including the Puget Sound chinook, or king salmon, have been hurt in all ways by human development in recent decades, by pollution and runoff that includes sewage and chemicals from fertilizers and by construction that in many cases has simply closed off waterways. Farther inland, their runs have been significantly reduced by the huge dams that provide the region's famously cheap and abundant hydropower.
"Our goal is recovery of the salmon," said Ron Sims, the King County Executive, who oversees an area that includes the city of Seattle and who has repeatedly said that he believed residents here were willing to pay more and take other steps to protect the fish. "However, our ultimate purpose is to restore our environment so that we may provide for the coexistence of people and fish in the Pacific Northwest."
The announcement on Tuesday, by the National Marine Fisheries Service, will extend Endangered Species Act protections on wild salmon found in nearly every watershed in Washington State, as well as in parts of the Willamette Valley in Oregon. The fish include the Puget Sound chinook, the Lower Columbia River chinook, Upper Columbia spring chinook, Lake Ozette sockeye, Hood Canal summer chum, Lower Columbia chum and the mid-Columbia steelhead. Decisions were delayed for six months on four other salmon runs in California and Oregon.
Federal officials said today that they believed that salmon restoration could amount to "life by a thousand stitches instead of death by a thousand cuts." But the devil will be in the details, and some political and business leaders have said some contemplated steps were far too Draconian to pass public muster.
The state Agriculture Commissioner, Jim Jesernig, said recently that state officials were already getting "beaten up by all sides," by Indian leaders and environmental groups who believe that the most likely measures will not do enough to protect the salmon and by homebuilders and farmers, some of whom, Mr. Jesernig said, were already calling state officials "jack-booted Nazis."
For now, many local officials here said they were convinced that there was a way to help the salmon and help people at the same time, especially since many people here list "runaway growth" or "sprawl" as one of their dominant concerns. And the officials think there is a way to do it without the legal rancor that has attended species listings.
"We've looked very hard at many of those cases," Tim Ceis, director of the Endangered Species Act policy coordination office for King County, said today. "The lawyers were the ones making the money. Nobody was spending any money on the fish."
But lawsuits may be inevitable, from both sides. The state's Building Industry Association, representing developers, says the salmon issue is being used to stop growth and that the most likely proposals for building restrictions show that local regulators have "lost all common sense." With the Seattle metropolitan area projected to add as many as one million people in the next 25 years, some skeptics say the fish do not stand a chance.
Environmental groups, on the other hand, say the issue can be a winner for both sides.
"Special-interest defenders of the status quo who oppose real action to save salmon would have you believe the listings will produce a shattered economy, a Cuba-on-the-Sound," said Tim Stearns, executive director of Save our Wild Salmon, an environmental group. "That kind of thinking is laughable, and in fact, the opposite is true. If our Governor and state Legislature get serious about salmon restoration, we would see enormous gains in our quality of life and real economic benefits."
While the restrictions are likely to place new limits on fish catches in many Washington rivers, they are not likely to change the diets of Pacific Northwesterners or anyone else in the United States who fancies the taste of salmon: most salmon eaten in this country is flown in from Alaska, or raised in domestic pens here, or in Canada and South America.

CORRECTION-DATE: March 17, 1999, Wednesday

 CORRECTION:
An article yesterday about threats to Pacific salmon misstated the planned classification of the fish. Federal officials proposed to declare that eight of nine wild salmon types in the Pacific Northwest would be listed as threatened species. Only one type, not all, would be listed as endangered. The Endangered Species Act allows officials more time to develop protections for species listed as threatened than it does for those with the more serious classification of endangered.

HEADLINE: POLL IN NEW YORK FINDS MANY THINK POLICE ARE BIASED

BYLINE: By DAN BARRY with MARJORIE CONNELLY 

 BODY:
In the aftermath of the shooting death of Amadou Diallo, fewer than a quarter of all New Yorkers believe that the police treat blacks and whites evenly, with blacks in particular viewing the police with fear and distrust, according to a New York Times poll.
Nearly 9 out of 10 black residents questioned in the survey said they thought the police often engaged in brutality against blacks, and almost two-thirds said police brutality against members of minority groups is widespread. More than two-thirds of blacks said the policies of the Giuliani administration have caused an increase in police brutality. 
 The survey suggests that police matters and race relations -- along with a growing dislike for the assertive style of Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani -- have combined to give him the lowest job-approval rating of his five-year tenure, 42 percent, reflecting a sudden, precipitous drop in his popularity. Just five months ago, a New York Times/CBS News poll found 63 percent of city residents approved of Mr. Giuliani's performance.
But since then, one issue has overshadowed all others: the death of Mr. Diallo. The 22-year-old African immigrant was hit with 19 bullets during a 41-shot fusillade fired by four white police officers as he stood in the vestibule of his Bronx apartment building in early February. Mr. Diallo was unarmed and had no criminal history.
The shooting has since become the focus of a grand jury investigation, and has prompted protests and rallies that continue, organized by black leaders who charge that it reflects a persistent and dangerous distrust of minorities by white police officers. It has also led to sustained criticism of Mr. Giuliani's tough-on-crime policies and his perceived failure to establish working relationships with many of the city's elected black officials.
Mr. Giuliani, who is considering a run for the United States Senate, has countered that the city's sharp reduction in crime and its improved economy have benefited the city's black and Hispanic populations, and that his critics are engaging in race-baiting. Although he has defended the police in general, he has repeatedly expressed his regrets over Mr. Diallo's death. On Sunday, he and Police Commissioner Howard Safir attended a prayer service in Brooklyn that was held in his memory.
But the results of the latest survey suggest that the city's black and Hispanic residents do not think the Mayor has done enough to control the police or improve the city's tenuous race relations. Sixty percent said that in his public responses to the Diallo shooting, Mr. Giuliani had made matters worse. That figure includes 47 percent of white residents, 61 percent of Hispanic residents and 79 percent of black residents.
The results point to a sharp disparity between blacks and whites over how the police have affected their sense of personal safety. A third of blacks said they had been in situations where they feared a police officer, while only 11 percent of whites said they felt that way. In contrast, 62 percent of whites said they had been in situations where they felt safer in the presence of a police officer, while 57 percent of blacks said they never felt that way.
Speaking for Mr. Giuliani, his press secretary, Colleen Roche, suggested that the poll results exaggerated the reality of attitudes in the city. "The poll numbers seem to be driven by false perceptions about police brutality, due in large measure to the intense media and public scrutiny of the Amadou Diallo case," she said. "The fact remains that the New York City Police Department is among the most restrained in the nation. As times passes and perspective returns, the poll numbers will once again reflect reality."
But James Taylor, 59, a black man from Brooklyn who participated in the survey, disagreed when called after the poll was completed. The police "don't give the minority neighborhoods a chance to explain themselves," said Mr. Taylor, a food production worker. "They will stop you for no reason and ask for identification. Giuliani may not be responsible for this kind of behavior on the part of the police, but he can certainly do something about it. He could start by not always taking the side of the police."
The New York Times poll was conducted by telephone last Monday through Sunday and surveyed 915 adult residents of New York City. The margin of sampling error for all New Yorkers is plus or minus three percentage points; for white residents it is five percentage points, and for black or Hispanic residents it is six points.
The poll included some encouraging indicators for Mayor Giuliani. Half of those questioned said that life in the city has improved in the last four years, a figure that was nine points lower than five months ago, but still significantly better than the 34 percent in a March 1997 poll. Residents also overwhelmingly approve of the Mayor's handling of crime, although that support dropped 20 points in five months, from 82 percent to 62 percent.
"He cares about the welfare of the people," said Linda Glaze, 39, a white housewife from Staten Island. "He's more than a politician. He's looking out for the people in terms of the economy, jobs, education."
But when asked to cite the worst thing that Mr. Giuliani has done as Mayor, 22 percent cited his handling of the police; 15 percent of whites and 28 percent of blacks cited that issue. The only other category to receive a double-digit response, 11 percent, was Mr. Giuliani's outspoken personality; 15 percent and 10 of blacks felt that way.
Also, in the five months between the two most recent polls, the perception of Mr. Giuliani as "a tough leader" has dropped from 50 to 42 percent, while the perception that he is "too abrasive" has risen from 37 to 47 percent.
The poll also conveyed a concern among residents about the behavior of the police that is more pronounced than the reaction that followed another notorious encounter: the alleged brutalization of Abner Louima, a Haitian immigrant, by police officers in a Brooklyn station house in summer 1997.
Forty-seven percent of those surveyed last week said that the policies of the Giuliani administration had caused police brutality to increase, compared with 31 percent who answered the same question in October 1997, shortly after the Louima case became public and just before Mr. Giuliani was overwhelmingly re-elected to a second term.
In addition, 70 percent of those polled recently said the police "often engage in brutality" against blacks, compared with 53 percent who felt that way in October 1997. Two-thirds said the police also brutalize Hispanic people; a similar question was not posed in 1997.
By comparison, only 12 percent said they believed that the police brutalize whites.
Overall, more than half of those recently surveyed said they believed that the police used excessive force, rather than necessary force. But again, their attitudes seem shaped by race. A third of whites say the police use excessive force, compared with three-quarters of blacks and two-thirds of Hispanic people.
In addition, 43 percent said they thought that police brutality directed against minority residents is widespread. But only 24 percent of white residents felt that way, compared with 63 percent of black residents and 55 percent of Hispanic residents.
The poll also demonstrated thelink between the Mayor and law enforcement, a link that he has nurtured for most of his public career. While the survey reflected the public's interest in reducing crime, with 20 percent saying it should be the Mayor's top priority, 19 percent said police behavior should be his main concern instead. That represents a sharp spike from the 4 percent who answered the same way in October 1997, after the Louima case.
"I don't think the police are compassionate enough, especially toward minorities," said Robert Altym, 48, a white hardware technician from Queens. "They don't hear them when they ask them a question. I don't think the police are as familiar or comfortable with the ethnic diversity of the city as much as they should be."
He added, "I think the Mayor has to insure that the police are trained more with this in mind."
But Peter Young, a Coney Island securities salesman who would not give his race over the phone, said he sympathized with the police. "In terms of brutality, I think some of it is exaggerated," he said. "When your life is on the line, you have to be extremely cautious. I'm not condoning brutality, but in many cases the criminals are better armed than the police themselves. Sometimes being over-cautious makes you do things you don't intend to."
 
How the Survey Was Conducted
The latest New York Times Poll was based on telephone interviews conducted March 8 to 14 in all parts of New York City with 915 adults. That included 414 white, 257 black and 234 Hispanic New Yorkers. Interviews were conducted in either English or Spanish.
The sample of telephone exchanges called was selected by a computer from a complete list of city exchanges. The exchanges were chosen to insure that each area in the city was represented in proportion to its population. For each exchange, the telephone numbers were formed by random digits, thus permitting access to both listed and unlisted numbers. Within each household, one adult was designated by a random procedure to be the respondent for the survey.
The results have been weighted to take account of household size and number of telephone lines into the residence, and to adjust for variations in the sample relating to race, Hispanic origin, sex, age and education.
In theory, in 19 cases out of 20 the results based on such samples will differ by no more than three percentage points from what would have been obtained by seeking out all adult New York City residents.
For smaller subgroups the potential sampling error is larger. For example, it is plus or minus five percentage points for whites, six points for blacks, and six points for Hispanic New Yorkers.
In addition to sampling error, the practical difficulties of conducting any survey of public opinion may introduce other sources of error into the poll. Differences in the wording and order of questions, for instance, can lead to somewhat varying results.

A chart on March 16 presenting results of a New York Times poll showed how white, black and Hispanic New Yorkers viewed the police. It did not report figures for Asian-Americans because Asians are a smaller part of the city's population and there were insufficient respondents to provide an accurate measure of their views. The chart should have included a footnote stating this limitation.

HEADLINE: Business Travel;
It's no accident that many of the faces in airport departure lounges are looking younger these days.

BYLINE: By Joe Sharkey 

 BODY:
RUTH STANAT talks fast, but this probably comes naturally for someone who has visited more than 100 countries on business in the last couple of years.
"There is no time anymore!" she gasped the other day from her office in Fort Wayne, Ind. "I just jumped off the plane from Geneva, and I hit the deck running. I can't even look at the schedule. Back and forth to San Francisco for two hours! I recently had a meeting in Washington, which I had to leave in the middle of, to go to Montreal." 
 Ms. Stanat, 51, is the president and founder of SIS International Research, a business planning and market research company with offices in 18 countries. A former senior executive at Chase Manhattan Bank and the Mars Corporation, Ms. Stanat has also managed to write two books, often working on airplanes or in airports. The most recent is "Global Jumpstart: The Complete Resource for Expanding Small and Midsize Businesses," with Chris West as co-author (Perseus Books, 1999).
While never leisurely, business travel has become more frantic with the accelerating speed of globalization, Ms. Stanat says. She chuckles now to think that she was once able to "drag my kids all around the world" and even enjoy an occasional carefree weekend in London. Now, especially with cellular phones and the Internet, she says, it's always a business day somewhere.
One of the consequences of this is that business travel is increasing in both volume and pace. "With the good economy, companies want their people on the road," said Christine Levite, a vice president at American Express. American Express estimates that United States companies spent $175 billion on travel and entertainment in 1998, up from $165 billion in 1997. And it is no accident that a lot of those faces in departure lounges are looking younger these days.
"Rather than just sending someone to Paris, a company will now send someone to four or five other countries in the European Union, and possibly to Prague and Budapest, too," Ms. Stanat said. "After about 10 days of this, most people are totally burned out. Companies are throwing so many young people out on the road because kids are resilient. They're usually not strapped down with families, and, hey, maybe it's their first time in Paris. They're willing to fly coach."
But there are limits even to youthful patience on the road.
The scene: Newark International Airport, AMR's American Airlines, Gate 30, last Thursday night. Flight 1535 to Miami has already been rescheduled five times from its original 6:20 P.M. departure time. There being few social lubricants as effective as adversity in the face of a common enemy, strangers have begun gathering in knots, muttering darkly to one another about what they say is a lack of reliable information about their flight, which American agents maintain has been delayed by that hardiest of excuses, "bad weather in Dallas."
At 9 P.M., after still another delay, Robert Rossi, a burly 28-year-old real estate salesman from Summit, N.J. who says that he travels 40 to 50 times a year on business, decides that he isn't going to take it anymore, not silently at least.
"Why do they keep lying to me?" he bellows, raising both arms and addressing the crowd. "They threatened to call the police because I'm complaining!"
Once, fellow travelers would have kept their eyes downcast at such a scene, like subway riders avoiding a panhandler. But Mr. Rossi's outburst actually elicits general approval from the crowd. One frustrated passenger puts in: "I'd call this a fly-by-night operation, but they aren't even doing that." Says another: "I just came in from in Dallas. The weather is fine in Dallas, just a little overcast."
Around 9:30, a group of Port Authority police officers, alerted to potential rebellion, is summoned to the departure gate. "There must be 15 police officers with clubs," marvels Joe Abelleira, a marketing executive with the Cordis Corporation.
Calm restored, the plane finally arrives for a 10:58 departure that will put passengers into Miami around 2 A.M. Oddly, the official reason for the late flight has now changed, at least on the American Airlines automated telephone flight-information system, which insists that "air-traffic control delays" were responsible for the problem with Flight 1535.

HEADLINE: About New York;
For Students, The Work Is in Albany

BYLINE: By DAVID GONZALEZ 

 BODY:
THE mushy mounds of slush and snow outside Hunter College on Monday morning were enough to prompt any self-respecting student to look forward to the rituals of spring break. Enticingly, a chartered bus awaited them on Lexington Avenue. A few students groggily went on board and settled into the seats in anticipation of their trip.
Of course, like many students enrolled in the City University of New York, they were too busy juggling work, school and sometimes family chores to have the time or money for a Florida respite. They were trekking north, to Albany. This might strike CUNY's critics as another example of the system's failings: Don't these students know enough geography to go south for a break? 
 They, along with several professors and administrators, were traveling north because they have tired of seeing their school's reputation heading south in the debate over the City University's problems. They were appealing to state legislators to block proposed cuts in the state's Tuition Assistance Program and to add $87 million to CUNY's budget, financing that they said was needed to hire more teachers, improve overburdened facilities and keep up with inflation.
The towers of the state's legislative complex appeared coldly intimidating, which only spurred some students to go on the lobbying trip. They wanted to put a human face on the numbers that get tossed about in the budget process, as well as show that they were not apathetic.
"We can't afford to give in by not pressuring our representatives to represent CUNY," said Julio Arroyo, a senior majoring in political science and language arts. "We're realistic. Sometimes you don't get what you want. That's part of the process. But we shouldn't lose the desire to try. That's an important message itself. We understand that young people, students, feel disenfranchised when they look at what they have to come up against. That should not be an excuse."
There is a ritual element to this, especially in this season, when various interest groups play tag-team lobbying with legislators. The Hunter College delegation departed from its routine of just sending students and faculty to meet with lawmakers. The delegation also kept a constant presence in a corner of the Legislative Office Building's indoor terrace with an exhibit of various programs and piles of fliers that showed how the school's graduates were being accepted into medical school and graduate programs, as well as faculty lectures on how its research helps the city in health and law enforcement.
The visits with lawmakers were brief and polite. Some listened intently and asked a few questions, while others could not wait to launch into discussions about all they were doing to help CUNY. The students themselves were eager to tell how previous cutbacks have resulted in too many students crammed into classes and not enough new books in the college library. Heather Perkins, a senior, explained how the increasing use of low-paid, part-time adjunct professors affected her studies.
"For once in my college career I would like to get a paper back with more comprehensive comments than 'Interesting, please expand,' " she said. "You have 35 students in a class, each writing 10-page papers, and the professors are adjuncts who don't have office hours and don't have the time to sit down and say more to you."
MANY of the students said the frequent calls to get more of them to graduate in four years failed to acknowledge how cutbacks have led to fewer offerings of required classes and how their job schedules prevented them from being able to attend the few that are offered. Catherine Reyes, a junior who transferred to Hunter from a private college in Virginia, told legislator after legislator that she has yet to be able to check a single book out of the library. Many of the books, she said, were either unavailable or being repaired.
Ms. Reyes was also concerned about repairing another kind of damage: that of the image of Republicans like herself. She had heard the Mayor and the Governor attack CUNY, so she was initially skeptical when she transferred to Hunter to save her parents the expense of private college tuition.
"People are ruining our reputation," she said. "I am impatient with Republicans who have given people such terrible ideas about CUNY. My experience has been great. I've learned more in two semesters at Hunter than before in a private college."

HEADLINE: How Jews Turn Houses Into Homes on West Bank

BYLINE: By DEBORAH SONTAG 

DATELINE: ELI, West Bank, March 16

 BODY:
From this entrenched Jewish settlement on a bluff above the Palestinian territories, the vista is dotted for miles around with what the Israelis call "facts on the ground."
Almost every hilltop bears a scattering of mobile homes, evidence of the continuing and willful expansion of the Jewish presence in the West Bank. 
 The hills are truly alive with the sound of hammers, buzz saws and bulldozers as Israelis -- with the help of Palestinian laborers -- dig into the land. They aim to sink their roots as deeply as possible in the hope that the acres they occupy now will never be turned over to the Palestinian Authority.
"When they built the hill, we climbed on up," said Oria Levinstein, 17, whose family moved from Eli, which is almost suburban, into a tin shack on a barren hillside nearby. "We felt like pioneers. At first it was horrible -- no water, no electricity. But now we have our trailers, and it's gorgeous. Look at this view! At night you see all the land of Israel. What, we should let the Arabs have it?"
For months Palestinian leaders have criticized the growth of Jewish settlements in the West Bank, particularly in the rocky hills between the Palestinian cities of Ramallah and Nablus.
And in the last few days, American diplomats have turned up the pressure on Israel to contain the expansion, butting heads with the Israelis in a war of words played out through the media.
Last weekend Dennis Ross, the American envoy to the Middle East peace talks, in an unusual public rebuke, called increased settlement activity "very destructive to the pursuit of peace."
On Monday Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, defying the American criticism, visited a West Bank settlement and vowed, "We want it to be bigger."
Today the American Embassy in Tel Aviv issued a pointed statement in response. "We have been troubled by Israel's expansion of existing settlements well beyond their periphery," said Larry Schwartz, the embassy spokesman. "These activities prejudge and predetermine issues that were to be reserved for permanent-status negotiations by changing realities on the ground."
The embassy statement was issued as Mr. Ross was flying to Madrid to see the Palestinian leader Yasir Arafat, in a meeting scheduled at the last minute. Mr. Ross was expected to press Mr. Arafat to delay a declaration of statehood beyond May 4, when the original Israeli-Palestinian peace accord expires.
Some Palestinian officials said they believed that the American criticism of Israel was timed to make Mr. Arafat more receptive.
The most recent Israeli-Palestinian peace memorandum, negotiated at the Wye Plantation in Maryland last fall, prohibits both sides from taking unilateral actions to jeopardize their understanding. The Americans, who brokered the agreement, see both a May 4 statehood declaration by Mr. Arafat and continued settlement expansion by Israel as unilateral acts that would violate the Wye accord.
The Israelis contend that they are expanding settlements based on the natural growth of the 140 communities; they say the settlements are theirs to expand until the future is decided in the final-status negotiations, which have not yet begun. Indeed, Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon counseled the settlers last fall to make haste by "grabbing hilltops" before land was turned over to the Palestinians.
But the Americans and the Palestinians contend that the expansion is carving out new Jewish communities, either by occupying new land or by turning makeshift communities into more established settlements by replacing trailers with houses.
"If we close our eyes to these facts on the ground, they will become a reality we cannot negotiate away," Ahmed Qurei, the speaker of the Palestinian Legislative Council, said at a recent meeting. "We cannot sit in our houses and watch the bulldozers."
In fact, though, Palestinian protests have been restrained. When one Palestinian legislator suggested forbidding Palestinian laborers to work on the settlement projects, another scoffed, saying, "Not until they have an economic alternative, like our own construction projects."
The American Embassy closely monitors settlement activity, but does not release any data.
But Israeli and American peace groups say 16 new settlements have risen in the five months since the Wye accord was signed at the White House. The trailer communities, blocks of white rectangles atop the highest hills, are as conspicuous as the banks of new house frames that stand beside the established communities.
"The system is very simple," said Mossi Raz, the general director of Peace Now in Israel. "The settlers go to a hill, most of the time next to the settlement where they live and in some cases outside the boundaries. They put up some trailers. They build a road to the place. And nobody does anything about it, not the police, not the army."
For the last five years, the settler population has grown by about 9 percent a year, to 170,000 Jews living amid Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza. Peace Now says the vacancy rate in the established settlements hovers around 8 or 9 percent, negating the argument that there is need to expand.
But Pinchas Wallerstein, the chairman of the Yesha Council, the umbrella settlers' group, said the empty residences represent natural turnover. He also said he hoped to see faster growth after the end of this school year.
"I hope it will increase by 11 or 12 percent this year," he said. "But I don't know that there are a lot of people who will be willing to pay $100,000 for a house in the middle of an area where the political situation is unstable. I can give them a narrow caravan, but if they want to live in a permanent house, they have to pay for it."
Mr. Wallerstein discounted most of the new hilltop communities. "They are not expansion," he said. "They are very young fellows or families who stay there to make a point, but the living conditions are too difficult. There is growth in the settlements, but it is not in the hills. What is important to us is to grow in a way that connects areas of Jewish sovereignty."
He cited as an example a six-month-old outpost of four families between Eli and Shilo, called Givat Harel, in an area at the center of the West Bank that is experiencing the greatest growth.
Eli is 14 years old and home to 400 families, both religious and secular, about 20 percent of whom are new immigrants. A sign at the foot of the hill promises houses "With Cable!" whose prices start at $49,000. The town director, Lior Shtul, boasts of the short commute to Jerusalem and Tel Aviv.
"There are those who come here for quality of life, and those who come for that plus ideology," he said. "Both ways, we grow. We continue to build. This government comes and this government goes, and nothing changes but what sits on the ground."

HEADLINE: Irish Leader Who Grew Into Eloquence

BYLINE: By JAMES F. CLARITY 

DATELINE: DUBLIN, March 16

 BODY:
When he was campaigning for election as Prime Minister in 1997, Bertie Ahern was disdained by many voters and politicians as a lightweight who had risen from the working class of Dublin and still spoke with a distinct North Side accent, which turned "th" sounds into D's.
He lacked gravitas, his detractors said, and would be something of an embarrassment representing Ireland among better-spoken Presidents and Prime Ministers. 
 Mr. Ahern acknowledged with some humor that he had trouble pronouncing words like "growth" and brushed up his diction. He won the election, narrowly, and when he meets President Clinton at the White House on St. Patrick's Day, accompanied by Celia Larkin, his partner of 10 years, his better-spoken opponents will be back here, restless and relatively powerless in the Parliamentary minority.
Mr. Ahern, whose tongue rarely fails him now, ignores what his supporters call "the chattering classes" of Dublin 4, an affluent and well-educated section on the South Side.
When he returns home next week, Mr. Ahern, 47, may be on the verge of making Irish history as the Prime Minister to preside at the completion of the Northern Ireland peace agreement and the official end to 30 years of sectarian violence in the predominantly Protestant British province.
But he may also be forced out of office and into an early election by a growing corruption scandal involving some of his allies in the Fianna Fail (Warriors of Destiny) Party.
Before he left Dublin last week, he sounded distinctly statesmanlike on the peace effort, saying:
"If the new agreement succeeds, it will see the two traditions working together both in Northern Ireland and on the island for the first time in 200 years. Every right-thinking person wants to see the back of conflict for good and to create a new and happier future for all."
Back home nobody is worrying about his accent or about the fact that he is not married to his partner, Ms. Larkin. His 10-year relationship with Ms. Larkin, a former Fianna Fail worker, has never become a serious political issue here. But his other political problems are real.
To form a coalition Government in 1997, he needed the support of the smaller Progressive Democrats Party. The prospects for a full five-year term were good. The economy was booming, and in a month Mr. Ahern had helped broker a cease-fire by the Irish Republican Army.
That paved the way for the accord in April to give minority Roman Catholics in Northern Ireland added power and to give overwhelmingly Catholic Ireland added influence in the affairs of Northern Ireland.
Then late last year, Mr. Ahern was suddenly reminded that political trouble was as easy to find as the rain. Some of his party's most prominent elected officials were accused of having taken huge bribes from executives.
One businessman, former Prime Minister Charles J. Haughey, who had fostered Mr. Ahern's career and once called him "the most devious and cunning of them all," was shown to have amassed wealth, impossible on an elected official's salary, including horses, a yacht, a farm and his own island off the coast.
Mr. Haughey, according to testimony, had received nearly $3 million from Dunnes, the largest chain of department stores in the country.
His coalition partner, Mary Harney, leader of the Progressive Democrats, which split from Fianna Fail 14 years ago over corruption, said she might quit the Government. That would lead to an election well before the constitutional deadline of mid-2002.
A majority of Irish people appear to believe that although Mr. Ahern is personally honest and lives modestly, he must answer for the past corruption of his party. Many people apparently feel that as a high party official, and a professional accountant, he had to have had some knowledge of what Mr. Haughey and other colleagues were up to.
A political consultant and a former ranking Foreign Ministry official, Fergus Finlay, said that to survive Mr. Ahern might have to find another coalition partner in the next election.
"Bertie Ahern," Mr. Finlay said in an interview, "has made a genuine effort to clear up his party's act and turn Fianna Fail into an organization other parties can do business with. But he's trying to do all that without confronting the ghosts of his party's past. And that's a recipe for failure."
Mr. Ahern would, of course, disagree. In the midst of the disclosures about some of his former allies, he said: "I am a credible person. I am an honest person."

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: COMMODITIES;
Gold Plunges After Clinton Suggests Sales by the I.M.F.

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER 

 BODY:
The price of gold plunged yesterday after President Clinton suggested that the International Monetary Fund should sell some of its gold reserves to help reduce the debt burdens on the world's poorest nations.
The proposal is not new, but had been set aside several years ago, in part because of the opposition of Germany. But after the election of the new Chancellor, Gerhard Schroder, the sentiment changed, opening the way to put the plan back on the table. 
 Then President Jacques Chirac of France suggested Monday that France could support I.M.F. gold sales for the same cause, aligning another major player -- and one-time opponent -- behind the sales.
Still, the sharp drop in gold's price yesterday and Monday seemed to indicate that a lot of investors had forgotten that selling I.M.F gold was a possibility, although the United States has supported sales for some time and other countries had brought up the subject again recently.
"The strange thing is that the I.M.F. story wasn't fully in the price," said Philip Klapwijk, a managing director of Gold Fields Mineral Services Ltd. of London, which produces some of the most closely watched research on gold.
"Sales are quite probable, but in the future," he said. "There is a lot of preparation that would be required."
The price of gold for April delivery on the New York Mercantile Exchange fell $3.70 an ounce, or 1.3 percent, to $283.90. On Monday it dropped $5.80 an ounce. From its recent high of $295.50 an ounce Thursday, the price of gold is off 3.9 percent and not that far from the 19-year low it hit in August.
What this proposal will do for the longer-term price of gold is uncertain, but it does not look positive.
I.M.F. gold sales would require approval of Congress and of other nations in the I.M.F. In addition, the I.M.F. would be expected to sell the gold in the most orderly fashion possible, if the plan was approved, to limit its impact. And it would be some time -- maybe a year -- before gold sales could occur.
However, the threat of the sale would hang over the market, making it harder for good news to lift the price. The threat of gold sales by the world's central banks has had a negative impact on the price of gold over the last several years.
"I was surprised the amount of impact merely the speculation had" on the price of gold, said George Milling-Stanley, manager of gold market analysis at the World Gold Council.
The I.M.F has about 103 million ounces of gold and under the Clinton Administration proposal about 5 percent, or 5.2 million ounces, would be sold. That is equal to about 6 percent of total mine production.
Mr. Clinton and Mr. Chirac said the money from gold sales should be used to expand a program of debt relief for a group of 41 of the world's poorest countries, known as Highly Indebted Poor Countries, or H.I.P.C. With the additional money from gold sales, the countries in that group could be expended to 50.
Mr. Clinton, who made his proposal before a group of African government officials, including representatives of highly indebted countries, said he wanted "extraordinary relief for countries making extraordinary efforts to build working economies."
Traders said that some other downward pressure on gold came from the fact that big speculators who had been betting that the price of gold would fall had just recently backed off those positions. That buying back of gold is what helped push the price up about $8, to $295. With this negative news, there was an opening for them to sell again.

HEADLINE: Fewer Fall Behind on Mortgage Payments

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 16

 BODY:
The number of American borrowers who fell behind on their mortgage payments declined in the fourth quarter, according to a survey by the Mortgage Bankers Association of America.
The delinquency rate fell to 4.24 percent in the October-December period, the association said. That is down from the rate of 4.37 percent in the third quarter and from 4.36 percent in the fourth quarter of 1997. 
 "A robust economy, booming stock market and the lowest mortgage interest rates in 30 years have been principal factors behind the improvement in the delinquency situation," said Paul Reid, the executive vice president of the Mortgage Bankers Association.
The findings mean that payments on 4.24 percent of the 23 million loans in the association's survey were overdue by at least 30 days in the fourth quarter. The delinquency survey, which tracks homes that have one to four units, covers about one-half of all residential mortgages.
The biggest regional drop in delinquencies occurred in the South, where the rate dropped to 5.11 percent from 5.29 percent.
Rates in the Northeast and North Central states dropped to 4.02 percent and 3.62 percent, respectively, from 4.18 percent and 3.78 percent, in the fourth quarter.

HEADLINE: Commercial Real Estate;
Purchase of One New York Plaza Reflects Toronto Company's Role

BYLINE: By ALAN S. OSER 

 BODY:
The decade of the 1980's looms in the history of Manhattan real estate as the era of the Japanese. Their money poured in through acquisitions of such trophy office properties as Rockefeller Center, the Exxon Building at 50th Street and the Avenue of the Americas, and Tower 49, at 12 East 49th Street.
Conceivably, the current period will look to future observers like the era of the public real estate company, as opposed to the family-owned development companies that historically were the principal owner-operators of Manhattan commercial property. Usually organized as real estate investment trusts, these regionally or nationally oriented companies have arrived with two feet in the Manhattan market, particularly since 1995. Investment partnerships backed by Wall Street opportunity funds have also been major buyers. 
 The latest sale to a public company with a national focus involves the TrizecHahn Corporation, a company based in Toronto with ownership interests in 65 million square feet of space in 119 properties in the United States, Canada and Europe, including 9 in New York City. TrizecHahn went into contract late last month to buy the fully leased 2.4-million-square-foot office building known as One New York Plaza, a 50-story tower completed in 1961 at the lower tip of Manhattan.
The seller was Chase Manhattan Bank, the initial major tenant and later the owner, and the price was $390 million, among the largest amounts paid for a Manhattan building in the last two years. That represents a price of $162 a square foot, roughly half the cost of replacing such a building. Chase undertook a major modernization program after signing Prudential Securities in 1992 to the space that the bank vacated in a move to Metrotech in Brooklyn.
TrizecHahn is not alone among the big publicly owned buyers of major Manhattan buildings since 1995, a year that marked the end of both the real estate recession and New York State's 10 percent tax on capital gains realized when investment property sells for more than $1 million. The tax was enacted in 1983 under Gov. Mario M. Cuomo and raised millions for the state initially. But ultimately, it worked mainly to inhibit sales.
Among the big publicly owned buyers in the last two years have been Vornado Realty Trust of Saddle Brook, N.J., which bought One Penn Plaza, off 34th Street between Seventh and Eighth Avenues, for $410 million last year; Boston Properties, the buyer of 280 Park Avenue, at 48th Street, the Bankers Trust Building, for $321 million in 1997, and Equity Office Properties Trust, based in Chicago, which acquired the Worldwide Plaza office building at Eighth Avenue and 50th Street for $578 million last October.
TrizecHahn was formed as the Trizec Corporation 35 years ago to develop Place Ville-Marie, the Montreal version of Rockefeller Center. Trizec evolved into a major United States and Canadian real estate owner-operator, encountered financial troubles in the early 1990's, went through a bankruptcy restructuring and emerged from it in 1994. Two years later, when its principal investor, the Canadian entrepreneur Peter Munk, merged it with his holding company, the Horsham Corporation, it changed its name to TrizecHahn, reflecting its holdings of regional West Coast malls developed by Ernest Hahn. The malls were sold last year for $2.5 billion.
The sale proceeds fueled TrizecHahn's office acquisition program. In New York City, its purchases have included 110 William Street, the 850,000-square-foot building at John Street downtown, a deal that closed in December, and a 50 percent interest in three major properties developed by the now-dissolved Swig Weiler & Arnow partnership: 1114 Avenue of the Americas (the W.R. Grace Building, at 42d Street), 1411 Broadway (the World Apparel Center, at 40th Street), and 1460 Broadway, at 41st Street. The Swig family remains its partner in the latter three.
At 1460 Broadway, occupied mainly by small textile tenants, the law firm of Skadden Arps Slate Meagher & Flom signed a lease last fall for 190,000 square feet, with 100,000 square feet to be ready this year and the rest over seven years as leases expire. The space will be used for back-office operations supporting the firm's main operation in the 4 Times Square building, now under construction at Broadway and 42d Street.
At One New York Plaza, where the major tenants besides Prudential Securities are Goldman Sachs & Company, the investment firm, and the law firm of Fried Frank Harris Shriver & Jacobson, no major leases come due until 2004. "We're making a long-term investment in a trophy property with first-rate tenants in downtown Manhattan," said Douglas Winshall, senior vice president of TrizecHahn in charge of its Northeastern properties.
The largest re-tenanting effort that TrizecHahn has taken on in Manhattan has been at 110 Williams Street, which had 200,000 square feet vacant when the sale closed last December. The building was part of a national portfolio of 10 properties that TrizecHahn bought from Equitable Life last year for $570 million. A lease for 50,000 square feet with an unidentified New York City agency is pending, Mr. Winshall said.
The World Apparel Center, at 1411 Broadway, is known as the premier showroom building for women's sportswear and bathing suits. Its largest tenant, the Jones Apparel Group, expanded in the building to 180,000 square feet last year from about 120,000 square feet, Mr. Winshall said.
Another TrizecHahn property is 1065 Avenue of the Americas, a 625,000-square-foot building at 40th Street. It was bought in late 1997 from Swig Weiler & Arnow for $59 million and was 90 percent occupied then. With the building fully leased now, its new arrivals include GeoCities, an Internet company; the inspector general's office of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, and the Rodgers & Hammerstein Organization.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: BONDS;
Inflation Optimism Helps to Push 30-Year Treasuries' Yield Lower

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Bond yields dropped to their lowest point in three weeks yesterday, aided by optimism that inflation will not accelerate and, to a lesser extent, by comments by Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, suggesting that the central bank will not raise short-term interest rates.
The price of the 30-year Treasury bond rose 2 2/32 , to 96 23/32 . The bond's yield, which moves in the opposite direction of the price, fell to 5.47 percent, from 5.52 percent on Monday. 
 Donald Fine, chief market analyst at Chase Asset Management, expects that Fed policy makers will not change interest rates when they meet March 30. "The economy's impressive strength will prevent the Fed from easing," he said, "while the auspicious inflation environment and global financial fragility argue strongly against any policy tightening."
Mr. Fine also believes that bond yields will hover around 5.5 percent for a while as fears of a Fed tightening dissipate.
Several reports yesterday pointed to solid economic advances. Housing starts declined just six-tenths of 1 percent in February, to an annual rate of roughly 1.8 million units, after setting a 12-year high in January. The levels of both housing starts and building permits in the first quarter are on track to significantly exceed those of the fourth quarter, Mr. Fine noted. A tapering of house construction is invariably a prelude to a slowdown in economic activity, so the robust performance of starts and building permits suggested continued momentum in the months ahead.
Industrial production rose two-tenths of 1 percent last month and manufacturing output also rose two-tenths of 1 percent -- its fifth consecutive monthly advance, and now up 2.4 percent year over year.
Mr. Greenspan spoke to the Independent Bankers Association of America meeting in San Francisco, where his remarks seemed to focus more on downside risks, providing only a marginal lift to the market.
Stocks also bolstered bonds as the Dow Jones industrial average surpassed 10,000 points for the first time in intraday trading; it closed lower, though, at 9,930.47. Traders speculated that some investors switched their allocations from stocks to bonds.
Gains could be limited in the days ahead, though, as several corporate debt issues are expected to be priced. Fannie Mae, among other borrowers, plans to sell as much as $13 billion of debt, and the AT&T Corporation expects to sell $5 billion to $6 billion in bonds.

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS;
For Mexico, An Economy With Gusto

BYLINE: By JULIA PRESTON 

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, March 16

 BODY:
The menu was eggs with hot chili sauce, and the mood had a certain zing as well. Top executives from foreign companies had breakfast today with President Ernesto Zedillo and told him that they planned to spend $10 billion this year on factories and other projects in Mexico, matching last year's direct foreign investment despite continuing uncertainties about Latin America.
A chipper speech by Mr. Zedillo and the satisfied applause of his audience showed how far Mexico had come in its efforts to separate itself in international investors' minds from other, more troubled Latin countries since economic crisis shook much of the region last year. 
 Foreigners' preference for Mexico has been felt in the stock and currency markets as well as in longer-term investments. Recently, the demand for pesos from investors has lifted Mexico's currency to levels not seen since before the global economy began to waver last year.
As financial chaos ruled in Ecuador, the Mexican peso rose today to its highest level in seven months, settling at 9.665 to the dollar. The stock market here also continued to climb, with the benchmark index rising 120.49 points, or 2.53 percent, to 4,890.39. The index has gained 48 percent since Brazil's currency, the real, suffered a steep devaluation in January, setting off a new round of worries about Latin American markets.
Mexico has attracted investors' attention because of the combination of disciplined fiscal policies enforced by Mr. Zedillo, a Yale-trained economist, and close ties to the thriving United States economy, which absorbed more than four-fifths of Mexico's exports last year.
"Mexico is a clear safe haven" for stock market investors, said Michael Gavin, director of Latin American research at Warburg Dillon Read. "Most investors know that Mexico is no longer an oil-based economy. It is clearly an economy linked to the United States," he said.
Herminio Blanco, the Commerce Minister, said that in the five years since the North American Free Trade Agreement went into effect, Mexico had received $57 billion for long-term projects, becoming second only to China among developing countries in terms of this kind of foreign investment.
Bernd Leissner, president of Volkswagen de Mexico, said the company planned to increase production this year by 55 percent compared with 1997 levels and to raise exports by 80 percent. The Volkswagen A.G. unit has invested $1 billion in its plants in the state of Puebla to build the new Beetle.
Mr. Leissner said that the North American trade pact and a similar one that Mexico is negotiating with Europe have made auto exports much easier, allowing Volkswagen's Mexican operation to "join the major leagues of our industry worldwide."
In 1998, when oil prices plummeted and world markets wobbled, Mr. Zedillo made three pre-emptive budget cuts to keep the deficit at a maximum of 1.25 percent, as he had promised. In Brazil, the Latin American country with which Mexico is most frequently compared, President Fernando Henrique Cardoso has battled a fractious Congress and moved more slowly on fiscal reform.
Mr. Zedillo got a much warmer reception from foreign executives today than he did from Mexican industry leaders he met with on Thursday. Mexican businesses remain hampered by a lack of credit and are wrestling with declining export sales because of the peso's strength.
In an unscheduled proposal, which put Mr. Zedillo uncomfortably on the spot, Eugenio Clariond Reyes Retana, president of the Mexican Businessmen's Council, urged him to convert to a dollar-based economy.
Mr. Zedillo, though, made it clear that he had no plans to abandon his policy of a virtually free-floating peso.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS;
The Dow Briefly Breaks 10,000 Before Retreating

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN 

 BODY:
The Dow Jones industrial average continued flirting with the 10,000-point mark yesterday, and even crossed it for a short time. But it reversed its early climb and ended the session lower.
Broader market averages were mixed. 
 The Dow, made up of 30 of the best-known names in corporate America, poked through 10,000 at 9:50 A.M., soon after trading began on the New York Stock Exchange, and rose as high as 10,001.78.
But the index pulled back and closed at 9,930.47, down 28.30 points, or nearly three-tenths of 1 percent, on the day.
While 10,000 is an eye-popping number, analysts noted that in percentage terms the rise from 9,000 was less significant than any of the other 1,000-point gains the average has recorded during its long bull run, which began in 1982.
"While people are transfixed with the prospect of all those zeros, what is most impressive is not the level itself but the length of this bull market," said Christine A. Callies, chief investment strategist at Credit Suisse First Boston.
The rise in the Dow, she said, "represents a complete shift from inflation-hedge assets like houses and gold mines to assets that thrive only when inflation is under control and Government fiscal policy is being reined in."
"Once those goals have been achieved," she added, "the equity gains tend to be smaller."
Indeed, market technicians and portfolio strategists have been concerned for some time that the rise in the Dow and other market gauges has been led by a relative handful of stocks. That narrowness, they contend, is a warning sign for the future.
"The lack of breadth in the market worries me to death," said Henry Herrmann, chief investment officer at Waddell & Reed, an investment firm in Overland Park, Kan., which manages more than $27 billion. "The market's internal technical factors just don't look good."
Yesterday's action fed this sort of concern. On both the New York Stock Exchange and the Nasdaq market, declining issues outnumbered those that advanced.
For the most part, stock traders tended to ignore a good day in the bond market as interest rates fell.
Well-known technology shares did better for a second consecutive session. But bank stocks, which rallied on Monday, fell back yesterday.
Trading volume on the Big Board was relatively modest, just shy of 752 million shares. On the Nasdaq market, 977.2 million shares changed hands.
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, which set a closing high on Monday, slipped 0.90 point, to 1,306.36. The Nasdaq, which has risen more than 11 percent this year, gained 7.83 points, to 2,439.27.
But the Russell 2000 index of smaller-company shares, a laggard for nearly a year, fell 1.67 points, or four-tenths of a percent, to 399.17. The American Stock Exchange composite index fell 4.60 points, to 716.31.
"We are fully invested in small and mid-cap stocks and are beating ourselves in the head every day," Mr. Herrmann said.
Two financial stocks, those of American Express and J. P. Morgan, were the biggest drags on the Dow. American Express, which has been among the market's best performers so far this year, fell 2 3/16 a share, to 123 9/16 . Morgan dropped 1 3/8, to 124.
Merck & Company, the drug giant, was the best-performing Dow stock; the company's shares rose 1 5/8, to 85 7/8, after the company received Government approval for expanded use of an anti-cholesterol drug.
Among big technology stocks, Intel gained 2 1/2 a share, to 120 3/8. A report released late Monday showed that semiconductor sales rose 1.2 percent in January, to $11.1 billion, compared with $10.97 billion in the month a year earlier as rising demand in Europe and much of Asia offset lower sales in North and South America. Microsoft rose 3 3/16 , to 169 1/16 . And Cisco Systems gained 1, to 106.
Flashnet Communications, an Internet service provider, more than doubled in its first day of trading, closing at 43 5/8, after coming to market priced at 17.
With the exception of Hewlett-Packard and I.B.M., technology stocks are absent from the Dow. But some market strategists said that recent weakness in technology issues boded well for stocks.
"Technology stock prices peaked on Feb. 1," said Thomas M. Galvin, chief investment strategist at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette. "But even though technology has been in the penalty box, the market has been able to hit new highs. Bond yields are stabilizing because of no apparent signs of inflation, and now earnings are beginning a cyclical recovery. The bull market is back in business."
Mr. Galvin, clearly optimistic about the market's prospects, projects the Dow will not flirt with the 10,000 level for long. By the end of the year, he expects the average to be at 11,000.

HEADLINE: Letting Little Go to Waste;
An Enterprise Evolves From the Byproducts of Industry

BYLINE: By CLAUDIA H. DEUTSCH 

 BODY:
Over a decade ago, Michael R. Daley was touring a plant that burned old tires for energy when he learned that it paid haulers to cart away gypsum, one of its byproducts. Mr. Daley was astounded: Gypsum, he knew, is used in plaster, toothpaste, paints, even molds for false teeth. So Mr. Daley set up shop near the plant to collect and resell the gypsum.
Since then, his company, Triad Energy Resources Inc., has grown into a successful small enterprise, all by setting up next to corporations and finding uses for their wastes. Triad makes soil additives from the C & H Sugar Company's sugar-filtration byproducts in Crockett, Calif. It turns leftover skins and seeds from Australian wineries and fruit processors into fertilizer and compost. And it is now contracting with fish processors in Oregon to turn their detritus into fertilizer and fish food. 
 "If companies were smart, they'd all locate near sources of waste," Mr. Daley said.
Corporate America is, in fact, catching on. More and more companies are buying their neighbors' wastes or selling their own. And a growing number of economic development agencies and private developers are building "eco-industrial parks" -- eco-parks for short -- for this purpose.
Some are doing it to attract jobs, others to reduce trash flows, still others simply to make money. But all are working on the principle that one company's waste can be its neighbor's raw material. And they are taking advantage of the fact that many wastes that cannot be recycled back to their original uses can still be profitably used as materials for other products.
"A park that makes environmental and economic sense is an idea whose time has come," said Dustin Bielagus, a developer who is building an eco-park in Londonderry, N.H.
Eco-parks are rising in Mississippi and Mexico. They are on the drawing boards in Puerto Rico and Mesa del Sol, N.M. The Dow Chemical Company is building one near its plants in eastern Germany.
In California, local officials plan an eco-park in Oakland, while the Cabazon Band of Mission Indians is looking for companies to set up at its trash-to-energy plant near Palm Springs to extract materials from the trash before it is burned.
While the environmental movement spawned the idea of such industrial symbiosis, it is no longer the primary force. "People realize that where materials are thrown out, there is money to be made," said Kevin Taylor, coordinator of the California Materials Exchange Program, a state group that brought Triad and C & H together.
There is money to be saved as well, added Reid Lifset, who edits the Journal of Industrial Ecology. "Companies are always looking for cheaper ways to procure raw materials," he said, "and the more they hear about eco-industrial parks, the more light bulbs go off."
The idea of selling and buying wastes is not new, of course. The Environmental Protection Agency lists about 40 government-subsidized waste exchanges. But now more entrepreneurs are becoming involved, charging companies for listing available wastes or waste-product needs.
"Valuable waste materials should not be consigned to subsidized exchanges whose funding can get cut," said William Sloan, who just started Millennium Exchange Ltd., a for-profit, Web-based waste exchange.
Even the terminology reflects the private-sector thrust, said Julie Rhodes, executive director of the Reuse Development Organization, a clearinghouse for information about re-using materials.
"People call them materials exchanges now, not waste exchanges," she said. "The whole idea is to think of waste as having value."
Still, most existing exchanges ignore location when they match waste sources with users. Factor in the cost of shipping waste, and the economics of selling it becomes shaky. But put companies next to one another, and the economics works.
"It's a lot cheaper to transport used lumber from next door than it is to truck wood down from a forest," said Ann Schneider, director of recycling programs at the University of California at Santa Cruz.
That is the type of argument that the Energy Answers Corporation, a resource recovery specialist in Albany, is using to woo companies to set up near the trash-to-energy plant it wants to install in Rio Pedras, near San Juan, P.R. Patrick F. Mahoney, president of Energy Answers, said he was close to persuading a paper company to reopen an abandoned plant on the site because it could recycle waste paper coming in and use cheap energy from the trash being burned. He said he was also talking to steel and concrete companies about using scrap steel from the trash and the fly ash that is left after combustion.
"We can put the companies close enough to get the materials by conveyor belt," Mr. Mahoney said.
Despite the proselytizing, eco-parks are not an easy sell. When a company is picking a site, a chance to lower disposal or materials costs pales next to considerations like availability of workers, taxes and nearness to customers. The sheer logistics of figuring out the proper mix can be daunting.
"We thought we could handpick a perfect assortment of businesses that would move right in, but it just doesn't work that way," said Michael Krause, executive director of the Green Institute, a nonprofit developer that just abandoned the idea of using guaranteed waste exchange as a draw for an industrial center it is building in Minneapolis.
And even if the companies come, who is to guarantee that none will move or change their products or go belly up?
"The minute one company changes its processes, the whole industrial ecosystem gets screwed up," said Stuart L. Hart, a professor of strategic management at the University of North Carolina's Kenan-Flagler Business School.
Not even environmentalists are unequivocal in their support. Nancy B. Hirshberg, director of natural resources at Stonyfield Farm Inc., fought to make waste exchange a requirement of the park that Mr. Bielagus is building next to Stonyfield's yogurt plant in Londonderry. But she is having second thoughts.
"Creating a market for wastes could create a disincentive to eliminate them," Ms. Hirshberg said.
Indeed, Mr. Bielagus acknowledges that his ideal tenant would generate no waste. And Ned Hall, an executive vice president of AES Enterprise, a company that operates power plants and will anchor the park, says the park's green premise has not stopped local residents from yelling, "Not in my back yard."
All told, the numerous ifs and buts have created a Catch 22: developers do not want to invest millions in setting up an eco-park until they have successful models to follow, yet such models will not dot the landscape until a few more pioneers take the plunge.
"It won't be a major trend until people see more good examples," said Nabil Nasr, director of the National Center for Remanufacturing and Resource Recovery at the Rochester Institute of Technology.
An example of sorts does exist in Kalundborg, Denmark, where companies have been using the principle for more than 20 years. But Kalundborg was not built for that purpose; it had a lucky confluence of companies that started to use one another's wastes after environmental regulations banned their disposal methods.
"Kalundborg was a wonderful accident," said Edward Cohen-Rosenthal, director of Cornell University's Work and Environment Initiative.
That accident may, in fact, have been replicated in Tampico, Mexico. Some 25 companies, all within a 40-mile radius, recently hired the Bechtel Corporation's consulting arm to identify their wastes. Bechtel found 44 waste streams, and one chemical plant is already using a pigment plant's waste ferric chloride as a water purifier, while a manufacturer of industrial gases is exploring ways to use carbon dioxide that is going up a smokestack.
"They are looking first to see what they can exchange among themselves, and then for what kinds of companies they will woo," said Paul Worhach, a Bechtel senior engineer.
Companies and developers in less industrialized areas do not have that luxury. So they are plunging feet first into courtship.
The Mississippi Economic and Community Development Department recently wooed a power plant to its new Red Hills Ecoplex in Choctaw County -- in the heart of lignite coal mining territory -- in part by pointing out the availability of on-site coal and water.
The plant will not start operating for two years, yet Robert T. Smira, the agency's deputy director, said he was close to leasing space to a brick maker that would use the clay left over from coal mining. The mining company, which normally uses the clay to fill in the holes its strip mines leave, will instead use the fly ash the power plant spews out. More fly ash will go for building roads, replacing the gravel that Choctaw now pays to haul in. And Mr. Smira is also trying to interest a wallboard maker in the fly ash.
That takes care of the solid stuff. Steady streams of water, at various temperatures, flow in and out of power plants, too. The eco-plex will have a greenhouse, a fish farm and a few food processors, all either feeding water to the plant or taking it. The greenhouse and a dry ice company will probably use the carbon dioxide from the plant's stacks.
That kind of everything-but-the-squeal setup attracted the AES power plant to Londonderry. A sewage treatment plant nearby will provide cheap water. Heated water coming out of the power plant will be piped first to other factories that can extract some of the heat, then back to the treatment plant. AES also expects to sell steam it would otherwise vent to the air.
In theory, it is an unbeatable system -- but no one knows how many manufacturers will respond. Other eco-park developers feel more comfortable casting a wider net for tenants, then offering incentives for them to use one another's wastes.
The Sustainable Technology Park Authority, a nonprofit organization, is building an eco-park in Cape Charles, Va., that welcomes any tenant that promises to operate along strict environmental rules. As tenants move in, it will use lists of their byproducts to woo others. But now it simply offers rent reductions to companies that exchange wastes.
"We aren't setting up the whole park around that," said Timothy E. Hayes, the agency's executive director. "But we hope that the availability of cheap materials will be an incentive to come here."

HEADLINE: Tax Cuts and Painful Reductions Proposed in G.O.P Budget

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 16

 BODY:
Republicans laid out a budget proposal today that makes good on their promises to cut taxes and increase spending on the military and education, but at the cost of deep cuts elsewhere.
Their plan is the Republican response to the budget proposal sent to Congress last month by President Clinton, and like the White House plan it makes shoring up Social Security the nation's top fiscal priority in an age of emerging surpluses. 
 The Republican plan was introduced today in the Senate Budget Committee, and a similar version is to be taken up on Wednesday by the House Budget Committee. While it is likely to prove no more than the opening Republican negotiating position, it makes clear that the surplus will not mute the debate over how to capitalize on the nation's prosperity.
Pete V. Domenici, the New Mexico Republican who is chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, said the plan would provide a tax cut next year of $15 billion and possibly more if the strong economy continues to generate higher-than-expected tax revenues.
The tax cuts would grow to $778 billion over the next decade. That is enough for the tax-writing committees in the House and Senate to choose among a variety of tax-cutting options, but probably not enough, Mr. Domenici acknowledged, for the 10 percent across-the-board reduction in income tax rates that Republicans had hoped to make the centerpiece of their agenda.
Seeking to blunt attacks from Mr. Clinton and Democrats in Congress that Republicans are shortchanging Medicare, Senator Domenici said his plan would set aside $133 billion over the next decade to cope with a variety of contingencies, including the possibility that an overhaul of Medicare would require an infusion of money.
The proposal would increase Pentagon spending by $18.2 billion, to $290 billion, reflecting an insistence among Republicans on rebuilding what they see as a dangerously run-down military.
In an attempt to neutralize a traditionally Democratic issue, the plan calls for a $3.3 billion increase in Federal spending on education next year, to a total of $103 billion.
But to allow the spending increases on the military and education while also meeting another bedrock Republican pledge -- to remain within the tight spending limits set out in the 1997 bipartisan budget deal -- the plan would require slashing spending on a wide array of other programs.
To stay under the cap on programs that receive annual appropriations -- $536 billion for next year -- the plan requires discretionary spending cuts of $14.7 billion next year, which some members of both parties said could well prove politically impossible. The plan would require even bigger cuts in the two subsequent years: $15.4 billion in 2001 and $22 billion in 2002.
The plan, if it is adopted by both the House and the Senate, would not become law but would be the guideline for the annual tax and spending bills Congress will take up this year. It is not binding but suggests specific cuts that the appropriations committees could consider in reconciling the demand from both parties for new and expanded programs with the painful discipline of the spending caps.
The proposal suggests that spending on environmental programs, for example, be reduced to $21.5 billion next year, from $23.9 billion this year. It would reduce spending on science, including NASA, to $18 billion, from $18.8 billion this year. It would shrink spending for agriculture to $14.3 billion next year, from $16.8 billion, and would not renew billions of dollars in emergency aid Congress gave farmers last year.
Mr. Domenici called the plan "a good start on wisely and effectively using projected surpluses into the next century."
But the Budget Committee's senior Democrat, Senator Frank R. Lautenberg of New Jersey, attacked the proposal, as did the White House.
"In order to fund an irresponsible and exploding tax cut, it fails to commit a single penny to securing Medicare and it requires discretionary cuts in the first few years that could not realistically be put together without serious reductions in key areas like education, health and environment," said Gene Sperling, the Administration's economic policy adviser.
Mr. Domenici said he hoped the committee would complete work on the plan this week and send it to the Senate floor for a vote next week. Last year, Mr. Domenici feuded over budget priorities with his counterpart in the House, Representative John R. Kasich, the Ohio Republican. But this year, the two men are working closely together to keep the party united as they head into months of negotiations with the White House on taxes, spending, Social Security and Medicare.

Brazil Stocks Defy Recession's Damage

BYLINE: By SIMON ROMERO 

DATELINE: SAO PAULO, Brazil, March 16

 BODY:
After spending much of 1999 so far straddling the line between pessimism and panic, Brazilian markets are staging a cautious rally that may be the first sign the economy, Latin America's largest, is starting to creep its way out of recession.
The benchmark Bovespa stock index, the main barometer of investor sentiment, moved today into positive territory measured in United States dollar terms. And when measured in the Brazilian currency, the real, stocks have risen 57 percent in two and a half months. 
 The last two days have been notable, with the Bovespa index gaining 8.77 percent on Monday and a further 2.35 percent today, to close here at 10,658.39.
The real, which spent much of January and February battered by concern over a possible return in Brazil to the turbulent times of hyperinflation, has strengthened nearly 15 percent in the last two weeks to settle in New York today at 1.87 to the dollar.
The improvement is partly the result of investor optimism after pledges by foreign financial institutions to renew credit lines totaling about $23 billion to Brazilian borrowers over the next six months. The foreign banks acted after pleas by the new president of this country's central bank, Arminio Fraga, a former fund manager for George Soros.
Lending rates, though, remain extremely high by world standards. Today, Bloomberg News reported, the overnight futures contract for May rose to 42.06 percent from 41.49 percent on Monday. Bonds were mixed, with the widely traded "C" bond yielding 16.04 percent.
But the signs that inflation may not be accelerating as fast as once feared have helped alleviate some investor concerns. "We're witnessing a shift in sentiment from very dark forecasts to a scenario of a long, slow recovery," said Octavio de Barros, chief economist here for Banco Bilbao Vizcaya. Mr. de Barros, like most other economists at large banks, said he saw the brunt of Brazil's economic difficulty occurring in the first half of the year, with a recovery, if an anemic one, starting late this year or early in 2000.
Banks' willingness to keep lending to some companies came on the back of an endorsement last week by the International Monetary Fund of the Government's plan to narrow the budget deficit. The I.M.F. agreed to provide a $9.3 billion installment from its $41.5 billion aid package, some of which the central bank can spend to combat currency speculation. "There's a realization in the markets that the recession we're experiencing is preparing us to emerge stronger, with a more vibrant export sector and improved public accounts," said Fernao Bracher, president of Banco BBA-Creditanstalt, in a telephone interview from Paris.
The Brazilian currency, though recently improved, has lost 35 percent of its value since the Government abandoned market support for it two months ago. Yet the severity of the recession brought on by devaluation is one of the main reasons why some analysts foresee resumed growth so soon. Dampened activity -- with economists forecasting output to shrink as much as 6 percent in the first quarter -- should translate into lower consumer demand for most goods, keeping inflation in check.
The likelihood that inflation will not gallop out of control, as it did in the early 90's, when price increases of 60 percent a month were common, allows consumers and companies to plan with more certainty. The Government's pledge not to let salaries be regularly adjusted for inflation provides additional assurance, said Julio Ziegelmann of BankBoston.
Still, it is too early to tell whether the new-found optimism on trading floors foretells any change in the bleak economic reality that many Brazilians are expected to confront in coming months.
Unemployment, hovering near a record at 8.4 percent, is seen rising as high as 10 percent in the next few months. And according to a study by Marcio Pocmann, an economist at the University of Campinas, per-capita income should fall 6.4 percent this year, steeper than declines in recessions in the 80's and early 90's.
"The stock market is not that accurate an indicator," said Guido Mantega, an economist affiliated with the opposition Workers Party. "People are getting poorer."

Unexpected Profits for Credit Suisse

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: ZURICH, March 16

 BODY:
Credit Suisse Group, Switzerland's No. 2 bank, reported higher-than-expected second-half profits today, helped by growth in money management and private banking that more than compensated for investment banking losses in Russia.
The company earned 700 million Swiss francs, or $475 million, equivalent to 2.6 francs a share. That compared with a loss of 1.37 billion Swiss francs, or 5.2 francs a share, in the second half of 1997. Credit Suisse First Boston, its investment bank, had a second-half loss of 1.272 billion francs, limiting full-year profit to 3.1 billion francs. 
 Credit Suisse, UBS and other Swiss banks are increasingly focusing on asset management and private banking, drawn by the steady earnings they offer, after losing hundreds of millions of dollars in riskier businesses such as emerging-markets, fixed-income and equities trading last year.
Credit Suisse shares rose 9.5 francs, or 3.8 percent, to a six-month high of 259 on the Swiss Exchange.
Credit Suisse First Boston's higher-than-expected loss in the second half was attributed to the financial crisis in Russia that sent stock and bond markets tumbling and caused the value of its investments to plummet.
The investment bank is the largest creditor among a group of Western banks holding $15 billion in defaulted Russian Government debt.
At the end of February, its Russian exposure was $1 billion, of which 61 percent was covered by reserves.
Exposure to other emerging markets included $1.296 billion in Latin America, $1.181 billion in China and Hong Kong, and $1.370 billion in Eastern European nations, Credit Suisse said.
Credit Suisse's 1997 profit of 397 million francs reflected a 1.4 billion franc charge to integrate the Winterthur Insurance Company, which it bought for about $10 billion last year, and to include the units of BZW Ltd. it acquired last year from the British bank Barclays P.L.C. for $255 million.

Daiwa Expects Big Loss
 TOKYO, March 16 (Bloomberg News) -- The Daiwa Securities Company, Japan's second-biggest brokerage firm, said today that it expected to lose 105 billion yen, or about $875 million, on cutting back business overseas.
Most of the pretax loss comes from Daiwa's withdrawal from activities in the United States and Britain and from selling off trading positions, the brokerage firm said. The loss was 54.7 billion yen more than Daiwa said in January that it would lose on reorganizing overseas.
All three of Japan's big brokers -- the Nomura Securities Company, the largest; Daiwa, and the Nikko Securities Company -- have cut back on their businesses abroad to focus on the domestic market. Daiwa began shutting down branches and cutting jobs last September.
The Tokyo-based brokerage firm expects to lose about 61 billion yen scaling back in Europe, 41 billion yen in the United States and 3 billion yen in Asia.

HEADLINE: G.O.P. Ads to Trumpet Whitman's Tax Plan

 BODY:
With a possible Senate run in store for Gov. Christine Todd Whitman, the New Jersey Republican State Committee yesterday announced a $153,000 television and radio campaign in support of the Governor's property tax relief proposal.
The Republican state chairman, Chuck Haytaian, denied yesterday that the 30-second television commercials and 60-second radio spots, which are to begin broadcasts in New York, New Jersey and Philadelphia today, were essentially Whitman campaign ads paid for with state party funds, commonly known as soft money, although he acknowledged that there could be a residual benefit for Mrs. Whitman if the property tax relief proposal is passed. 
 "If there's a residual, we're talking about next year," he said. "And this year, it will, hopefully, help the Republicans in the Assembly, because we have Assembly elections this year. It's a good program."
The plan, which would be phased in over five years, would provide homeowners with a total of $1 billion in property tax reimbursements by the fifth year. Mrs. Whitman outlined the plan in January, and a Republican State Senator, John Mattheussen, introduced legislation for it on Monday.
Democrats who responded to yesterday's announcement focused their criticism on the merits of the tax plan, not on whether the advertising campaign was intended as an early Senate boost for Mrs. Whitman.
"I'm assuming that the ad is not saying anything about the fiscal imprudence of promising people five years of tax relief," said Jim Florio, who was defeated by Mrs. Whitman in his bid for re-election as Governor in 1993, and is seeking the Democratic nomination for Senate. Mrs. Whitman, on a trade mission in South America, said she would announce whether she would run for the Senate after she returned on March 29.
Mr. Florio and others, including the State Democratic Chairman, Thomas P. Giblin, said that the plan assumes that the economy will continue to grow for at least five more years and thus pay for the property tax reimbursements without raising income or sales taxes.
Mr. Haytaian said property tax relief would be one more promise that Mrs. Whitman would keep, in addition to the income tax cut she heralded to help her unseat Mr. Florio. But Democrats repeated their criticism that the income tax cut merely led to property tax increases, and said that this pledge could be beyond Mrs. Whitman's control to keep.
"These are the good times," Mr. Florio said.

Dow Crosses 10,000 Mark But Retreats for the Day
The Dow Jones industrial average continued its flirtation with the 10,000-point mark, even crossing it briefly. But it reversed its early climb and ended the session down 28.30 points, or three-tenths of a percent, to 9,930.47. 
Broader market averages were mixed, with the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index edging down 0.90 point, to 1,306.36. The Nasdaq composite index rose 7.83 points, or three-tenths of a percent, to 2,439.27. Page C11.
 
Bond yields dropped to their lowest point in three weeks, aided by optimism that inflation will not accelerate and short-term interest rates will remain steady. C11.

Workers to Share Goldman Wealth
Goldman, Sachs, Wall Street's last big private partnership, detailed its plans to go public and offered a glimpse of how it will divide as much as $24 billion in projected net worth. For the general partners who own the firm, the average value of their shares will reach about $50 million. But employees below that level will share a $5 billion windfall, secretaries, janitors and word processors included. A1.
 
Coca-Cola's Marketing Costs Rise
In its annual report, Coca-Cola said it spent more than $1.2 billion on marketing and other support for its largest bottler, Coca-Cola Enterprises. That's nearly twice what it spent the year before on the bottler, which handles the bulk of Coca-Cola's volume in the United States. That expenditure helped raise case volume in the United States by 6 percent, but the marketing costs were keenly felt at Coca-Cola, which turned in one of its most lackluster performances in years in 1998.

HEADLINE: Albany Democrats Urge 4.6% Budget Increase

BYLINE: By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA 

DATELINE: ALBANY, March 16

 BODY:
The Democrats who control the Assembly called today for a 4.6 percent rise in state spending, more than double the increase Gov. George E. Pataki has proposed, setting the boundaries for another fierce budget fight.
Mr. Pataki assailed the Democrats' plan as irresponsible, raising the prospect that like last year, he might veto most of the money the Legislature adds to his proposed budget. Mr. Pataki has proposed a $72.66 billion budget for the fiscal year that starts April 1, while the Assembly Democrats describe their plan as $2 billion higher. 
 Most of the difference lies in the Democrats' rejection of Mr. Pataki's proposed cuts in health care and education. Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver said his house's plan "rejects the devastating cuts that would have been funded on the backs of our children and on the backs of working families and senior citizens."
After an 8 percent increase in the budget last year, when he was running for re-election, Mr. Pataki has called for a 1.8 percent rise this year, vowing to keep the increase within the rate of inflation, despite a $2 billion surplus.
Democrats charge that the Governor is trying to impress conservatives in other states as he looks toward a possible campaign for national office next year.
The plan released today is just the Democrats' opening bid, but the gap between it and the Governor's proposal fed a growing resignation here to the prospect of a late budget for the 15th straight year.
Mr. Pataki; Joseph L. Bruno, the Republican majority leader of the Senate, and Comptroller H. Carl McCall, a Democrat, all predicted today that a budget would not be passed by April 1.
When asked about the Democrats' plan, Mr. Pataki said, "We have not seen anything to remotely justify the level of spending we're seeing from the Assembly."
But Mr. Silver, a Democrat from Manhattan, said tax revenues were growing so quickly that his plan would set aside $1 billion from the current surplus for future needs and still run up an additional $1.3 billion surplus next year.
The Senate's Republican majority has not released a detailed budget plan, but Mr. Bruno said today that his house would seek about $800 million, or 1.1 percent, more than the Governor, putting the two houses $1.2 billion apart.
Budget negotiations between the two houses are stalled on the fundamental question of how much money is available, and have not yet even touched on how it will be spent. Mr. Silver said he would name members of budget conference committees on Wednesday, leaving just two weeks in the fiscal year for the committees to strike deals.
Until 1997, the Governor and the two legislative leaders met privately to reach a compromise budget. Then last year, the Legislature met in conference committees to hash out a budget publicly, without the Governor.
But Mr. Pataki demonstrated, by broad use of his line-item veto power, that the new process had freed him from the need to compromise, greatly increasing his power over the budget.
Mr. Silver says he remains committed to conference committees, which rank-and-file Assembly members enjoyed because it gave them more say in the process. But aides say he is still searching for a way to avoid a repeat of last year, slowing talks with the Senate.
The April 1 deadline carries new weight this year, because the law passed in December that gave state officials a pay raise also requires that legislators' salaries be withheld as long as the budget is late. If the budget is more than a few weeks late, the delay in being paid could present a serious hardship for many lawmakers, adding to the pressure to reach a settlement.
The Assembly Democrats proposed adding $1.1 billion to the Governor's budget for Medicaid, the health insurance program for the poor. Most of that is a reversal of cuts the Governor had proposed, rather than new spending.
They also called for $645 million more than Mr. Pataki did for aid to local schools, including restoration of some cuts. In all, the Democrats want a $900 million increase over last year, or more than 7 percent, in school spending.
The Democrats are also seeking $291 million more than the Governor for the State University and City University of New York systems. But again, much of that would simply reverse cuts Mr. Pataki has proposed, particularly in tuition assistance to poor students.
In other areas, the Assembly plan rejects Mr. Pataki's call for a new state prison, but embraces the Senate Republicans' support for an expanded tax credit for the working poor.
The Democrats said their overall budget, including Federal aid for programs like Medicaid and welfare, is $74.66 billion, a 4.6 percent increase from the current year. The portion generated by the state, through taxes and other sources, is $50.9 billion, they said, up 5 percent.

HEADLINE: In a Surprise, Factory Output Had a Slight Gain in February

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 16

 BODY:
Industrial production unexpectedly rose in February, led by a fifth consecutive monthly gain in factory output, and construction of new homes stayed near a 12-year high, the latest signs the economy is surging as it heads into its ninth year of expansion.
"We're starting to hit on all cylinders" after a year of weak export demand, Paul Kasriel, an economist at the Northern Trust Company in Chicago, said today. "Manufacturing is coming back. That was the weak link in 1998." 
 Industrial output rose two-tenths of a percent last month, the Federal Reserve said. Analysts were predicting production would be unchanged, as it was in January. The plant-use rate, which measures industrial capacity in use, fell a tenth of a point, to 80.3 percent in February, the lowest since August 1992 and a sign that inflation-causing production bottlenecks are unlikely to develop.
Housing starts fell six-tenths of a percent in February, to an annual rate of 1.799 million units, not far from the 12-year high of 1.810 million in January. Moreover, starts of single-family homes rose 1.1 percent last month, to a rate of 1.413 million, the strongest pace since December 1978, the Commerce Department said.
The ability of American workers to produce more at less cost is fueling the expansion, Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, said today. That puts him among those who say that one-time benefits from lower oil prices and low-cost goods from overseas are not the only reasons inflation is staying low.
"These accomplishments are doubtless partly the result of influences that may prove transitory, but a number of fundamental strengths imply more lasting benefits," Mr. Greenspan said in a speech to the Independent Bankers Association of America in San Francisco.
The Fed's industrial production report showed that manufacturing output advanced two-tenths of a percent in February. Mining output rose four-tenths of a percent, its first increase in a year. Output at utilities decreased six-tenths of a percent.
Production of durable goods rose five-tenths of a percent last month after rising two-tenths of a percent in January. Output of nondurable goods fell two-tenths of a percent in February after falling one-tenth of a percent in January. Business equipment output, including computers, rose two-tenths of a percent.
A key question for housing in the months ahead is the recent rise in mortgage rates. The average 30-year mortgage rate rose last week to 7.11 percent, the highest level since the third week of May last year, according to Freddie Mac.

HEADLINE: MEDICARE PANEL, SHARPLY DIVIDED, SUBMITS NO PLAN

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 16

 BODY:
A Federal advisory commission searching for ways to preserve Medicare disbanded tonight in disagreement, just three hours after President Clinton denounced its proposed report and said he would devise a plan of his own as an alternative.
The commission ended its work without endorsing any recommendations to avert a financial crisis in the program, which provides health insurance for 39 million Americans who are elderly or disabled. 
 The 17-member commission, headed by Senator John B. Breaux, Democrat of Louisiana, fell one vote short of the 11 votes needed to approve a final report. Ten commission members -- 8 Republicans and 2 Democrats -- voted for major changes that would convert Medicare into an arena for competition among public and private health plans. Sad but not surprised, Mr. Breaux said, "We have advanced the Medicare debate in a very significant way."
Congress created the commission in 1997, expecting that it would propose the difficult and perhaps politically unpopular choices needed to insure the program's solvency.
Medicare will almost certainly become an issue in the next Presidential campaign. Democrats can portray themselves as defenders of Medicare, offering new coverage for prescription drugs, while Republicans will criticize Mr. Clinton and other Democrats as thwarting efforts to stave off the insolvency of the Medicare trust fund.
Senator Breaux and Representative Bill Thomas of California, the leading Republican member of the commission, said they would keep fighting for their proposal, under which the Government would offer a fixed amount of money to each beneficiary to purchase a public or private health plan.
Until today, Mr. Clinton had studiously refrained from commenting on the work of the commission. But late this afternoon, less than an hour before the panel began its final session, Mr. Clinton went to the South Lawn of the White House and criticized the proposal supported by 10 of the 17 commission members.
Mr. Clinton said the proposal, drafted by Mr. Breaux and Mr. Thomas, "does not provide for an adequate, affordable prescription drug benefit" for the elderly and disabled. Moreover, he said, the proposal could increase the number of Americans without health insurance, by raising the eligibility age for Medicare to 67 from 65, and could cause excessive increases in premiums for people who remain in the traditional Medicare program.
Finally, Mr. Clinton said that Mr. Breaux's plan was unacceptable because it did not include the President's proposal to earmark 15 percent of any future budget surpluses for the Medicare program. Independent experts agree that Medicare needs "substantial new revenues" to provide for the baby boom generation, Mr. Clinton said.
After thanking the commission for "valuable work," Mr. Clinton said he would devise his own proposal, and he said he hoped Congress would approve it this year, but he gave no details of what he had in mind.
"I want an agreement this year," Mr. Clinton said. "I am going to do my dead-level best to get it done."
Mr. Clinton spoke out after it became clear that members of Congress from both parties were faulting him for the commission's failure to agree on any recommendations.
The Senate Republican leader, Trent Lott of Mississippi, said Mr. Clinton "chose to kill the Medicare commission's bipartisan recommendations one-half hour before the commission was scheduled to meet." But Barry Toiv, a White House spokesman, said Mr. Clinton did not try to influence commission members "one way or the other."
Medicare costs are growing faster than the available revenue, and many lawmakers see an urgent need to repair the program because the the trust fund that pays hospital bills is expected to run out of money in about a decade.
Mr. Clinton appointed 4 of the 17 commission members. All 4 voted against the Breaux-Thomas proposal, though 2 of the 4 said they saw some merit in it. The other commission members were appointed by the Speaker of the House, the Senate Republican leader and the Democratic leaders of the two chambers.
One of the Clinton appointees, Prof. Stuart H. Altman of Brandeis University, said Mr. Breaux's plan did too little to find additional revenue for Medicare and to guarantee affordable drug coverage.
"We do need more money in this program," Mr. Altman said. "We need it sooner rather than later."
Another commission member, Laura D'Andrea Tyson, the former chairwoman of Mr. Clinton's Council of Economic Advisers, said she supported efforts to inject competition into Medicare. But Ms. Tyson said such competition could never produce enough savings to solve Medicare's financial problems.
Representative John D. Dingell, Democrat of Michigan, acknowledged that the commission was influenced by politics, but he declared: "Thank God for it. That's the exercise of free men and women doing the business of their Government." Unfortunately, he said, "the proposal before us would convert Medicare from a universal guarantee to a Government voucher for private insurance."
Senator Breaux disagreed. "This proposal is not a voucher program," he said. "It is not an end to Medicare as an entitlement."
The chairmen of the House Ways and Means Committee and the Senate Finance Committee said they would hold hearings on the Breaux-Thomas proposal. And Mr. Breaux said the full Senate would probably support much of the proposal. But the outlook for action in Congress is murky, unless Republicans agree to Mr. Clinton's proposal to use some of the projected budget surplus.
Mr. Thomas said the proposal to earmark some of the surplus for Medicare was a bookkeeping gimmick. "The President's proposal is likely to create a public misperception that something meaningful is being done to reform the Medicare program," Mr. Thomas said.
Many health policy experts say Medicare will eventually need additional revenues, beyond the current sources of money, which include premiums paid by beneficiaries, workers' payroll taxes and general revenues from the Treasury. But Newt Gingrich insisted that his appointees promise not to vote for tax increases. And the commission did not seriously consider tax increases.

HEADLINE: An Expensive Fish

BYLINE: By SAM HOWE VERHOVEK 

DATELINE: SEATTLE, March 16

 BODY:
In a sense, what is most remarkable about the Federal Government's announcement today that it would list nine types of salmon under the Endangered Species Act, a move that will force new building restrictions and raise taxes across the Seattle area and elsewhere in the Northwest, is how little controversy it has stirred -- so far, anyway.
But this new application of the law, the broadest in the statute's 26-year history in terms of both geography and the effect on a human population, is almost certain to become a test of the willingness of an entire urban region to pay large sums of money and perhaps even sacrifice some growth for what has become a political battle cry: the control of "sprawl." 
 The effort to restore the once-vigorous runs of the Puget Sound chinook and other salmon is really a cause that combines elements of a customary environmental crusade with those of the more recent drive against rampant growth -- the kind of concern that tops Vice President Al Gore's "livability agenda," which he hopes to make a centerpiece of his Presidential campaign. Restoring the salmon will entail cleaning up the waterways that snake all over the Puget Sound region, promoting and preserving green space and open space, limiting the creep of suburbanization -- the things that people seem to clamor for in opinion polls.
Those polls indicate overwhelming support here for doing whatever is necessary to save the salmon, which are running at a fraction of their historic peaks. A big rally on the eve of today's long-awaited announcement drew Seattle's Mayor and other top local officials, all in support of the fish. "What's good for salmon is good for people," one placard said.
But the effort could well mean measures that might not prove so popular, particularly in the long run. Fertilizer use could be banned in some areas, and residents' use of water might be limited. And it will cost hundreds of millions of dollars, perhaps more, to preserve crucial land.
So what now seems a popular move could well prompt a severe backlash against the Endangered Species Act and those local officials who must adopt the required restrictions.
"Really, what's involved here is that for the last 100 years, as we developed out here, we sort of forced the salmon to adjust to us," said William D. Ruckelshaus, a Seattleite who was Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency in both the Nixon and Reagan Administrations and now heads a business round-table group on salmon. "Well, now we have to figure out how to adjust to the salmon. At this juncture, there is tremendous enthusiasm for that, enough political support to cause politicians here to feel comfortable in taking some pretty extraordinary steps."
"But it could all evaporate," Mr. Ruckelshaus added. "It could turn into a fight and a struggle. I don't think it will, but it could."
Others say there is reason to be skeptical.
"The old Clinton slogan was 'putting people first,' and now the Gore slogan is 'putting salmon first,' " said Alex Castellanos, a Republican political consultant, referring to Mr. Gore's advocacy of salmon restoration and his recent promise of $100 million in Federal aid as part of what he and the President called "a new partnership for salmon recovery."
The general idea "sounds good to people, so of course they'll say they're for it," Mr. Castellanos said. "Even so, here's what always happens: The best day is the first day it's announced. After that, when you get to putting the price tags on it, there's just a steady, steady erosion. After a while, people begin to ask, 'Well, what else could you do with this money?' What if the question becomes, Do you save salmon or do you save seniors?"
And even if public support does hold, still others wonder whether the salmon runs can really be nursed back to health. The Seattle-Tacoma region already has nearly three million people, and it continues to grow; some projections call for a population growth of one million in the next 25 years.
At a briefing on Monday, the King County Executive, Ron Sims, a Democrat who is a strong proponent of salmon restoration plans and a potential candidate for the Senate next year, said economic growth and saving the salmon were not incompatible. "We're not going to tear down the Seafirst Bank building," Mr. Sims said of a dominating skyscraper here, "and replant it with Douglas fir. The key will be to make sure we're smarter with the land mass that's available. This area is going to have to become greener."
If it grows by one million people, though, it is hard to see how it can.
Under the Endangered Species Act, local officials must now work in the coming months to develop plans for restoring the salmon runs. If there is no improvement, local governments and eventually even private citizens could face Federal sanctions.
For the moment, the support for salmon protection efforts is sufficiently broad that announcements about the listing today were attended by political figures, environmentalists and business leaders like Steven Rogel, president of the Weyerhaeuser Company, the timber concern, whose headquarters are just outside Tacoma.
"Today's listings means that all of us are going to have to do our fair share to solve the salmon crisis," Mr. Rogel said. "Forest landowners are ready to go."
As a result of the listing, the logging industry is facing potential restrictions that could protect hundreds of millions of dollars' worth of trees close to waterways. The industry is already pushing for a reduction in excise taxes that could offset at least part of that loss.
In the end, the key to a successful protection effort may be a feeling among all parties that they are being affected equally.
"If people are convinced that this whole thing really is a partnership, that everybody is doing their fair share, then I think you could continue to see a lot of support," said Robert E. Gogerty, a consultant here who has advised both businesses and political candidates. "But if they think they're bearing the brunt of it, then you could see a rebellion."

HEADLINE: Forbes Declares Candidacy On Internet and the Stump

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 16

 BODY:
Renouncing the traditional brass bands and patriotic bunting, Steve Forbes, the multimillionaire publisher, today became the first Presidential contender to formally announce his candidacy on the Internet.
Mr. Forbes, in his second try for the Republican Presidential nomination, cast himself as unconventional and future-oriented, telling viewers who clicked on his sleek, unadorned Web page, "You and I are entering the information age -- and the Washington politicians are stuck in the Stone Age." 
 Although he has barely broken stride since his defeat in 1996, Mr. Forbes used his remarks to try to reshape his image as a candidate with bucketfuls of money and a lackluster speaking style whose trademark is a flat tax. While he still champions the tax, he did not dwell on it today. Instead, he devoted his speech to his newly burnished credentials as an outspoken backer of religious conservatives and a foe of abortion -- as well as his concerns about the global economic crisis.
"Now," he said, "the central questions of the year 2000 campaign clearly are these: Do you trust the establishment politicians to protect your economic security and give you more freedom and more control over your life? Do you trust them to defend your values and protect the first and most important freedom of every child: the freedom to be born?"
"Do you trust them to confront the atrocities in China, end Saddam Hussein's reign of terror and deploy a real missile defense system to protect our children?" he continued. And, eagerly lambasting the Democrats, Mr. Forbes added, "Do you trust other politicians to clean out the corruption and sleaze of the Clinton-Gore Administration?"
Despite his relentless campaign schedule, Mr. Forbes, who is 51, has thus far languished in the shadows of two better-known prospects: Gov. George W. Bush of Texas and Elizabeth Dole. As they did four years ago, many Republicans question whether a bland business executive who has never been elected to anything can capture the party's nomination.
Yet, particularly after his performance in 1996 -- when he lavished more than $35 million of his fortune on his campaign -- no one doubts Mr. Forbes's staying power in the primary season. And no one doubts his potential to shape the dialogue significantly.
Although Mr. Forbes was a fleeting sensation in 1996, registering high in the polls when he first unleashed his television blitz and scoring victories in the Delaware and Arizona contests, he placed fourth in the pivotal Iowa caucuses and New Hampshire primary. But his hard-hitting advertisements -- opponents called them mean-spirited -- came close to ravaging the candidacy of Bob Dole, who ultimately became the Republican nominee.
As Mr. Forbes did last time, he plans to forgo Federal spending limits and dig deep into his family fortune to finance most of his campaign. Mr. Bush is the only other contender who is thinking about eschewing spending limits. So even if the other candidates' money dries up, Mr. Forbes can run television advertisements till the bitter end. And his more than ample resources have helped him lure some of the most skilled party workers, including Steve Grubbs and Nancy Streck, both Iowa operatives who had been courted aggressively by other campaigns.
In an interview, Mr. Forbes disputed that he was drawing staff members more because of his bankroll than the appeal of his candidacy.
"We compensate people according to responsibility and ability," he said. "And being of Scottish descent, I'm not going to spend a penny more than necessary. The key is having the message and getting it out to the voters. But money alone won't win it for you."
Mr. Forbes said he believed he was better positioned than in 1996 because then he did not enter the race until late 1995.
"We did not have the opportunities, except very, very late to set up the grass-roots organizations in early states," he said. "People are going to have a better feel of what we're proposing than in the short period of '95 and '96."
Mr. Forbes has refashioned himself, too. The most striking change is that he has assiduously courted social conservatives and emphasized abortion and other social issues he neglected four years ago. At the very least, the changed emphasis has neutralized many religious conservatives who opposed him in 1996.
He has also emphasized other issues, including allowing workers to divert part of their Social Security taxes into individual investment accounts and providing parents with vouchers for private schools.
"Do you know what astounds me?" Mr. Forbes asked in his Internet remarks. "More young people believe in U.F.O.'s than believe that they're going to collect Social Security when they retire."
By announcing his "information-age campaign" on the Internet, Mr. Forbes sought to add another fresh dimension to his candidacy. While every major Presidential campaign has a Web site, the Forbes organization is promising bells and whistles, including the beaming of photographs, live, from the stump.
After his unconventional announcement was posted on the Web site, www.forbes2000.com, Mr. Forbes staged a conventional rally that drew about 50 people on the steps of the Capitol in Concord, N.H., where he retreated to his signature issue of a flat tax that would tax all wage income at 17 percent. He signed a pledge promising not to raise taxes -- the first rule of politics in New Hampshire -- and challenged other candidates to do the same.
Mr. Forbes's remarks were disrupted by a few hecklers, some wearing fur coats, who called themselves Billionaires for Forbes. But he tried to turn his fortune into a virtue, saying, "I'm the only only who is not beholden to the Washington culture of special-interest lawyers, lobbyists and lifetime politicians."
The message seemed convincing to Ginny Burke, a former state legislator from Bedford, N.H., who traveled to Concord on this blustery day to show her support for Mr. Forbes.
"I think he's following common sense," Ms. Burke said. "He doesn't owe anything to anybody. He doesn't have to try to please the lobbyists to raise money, and I think that, unfortunately, most candidates do."
Roger Stone, a veteran Republican strategist who is not affiliated with any campaign, dismissed Mr. Forbes's candidacy. "He's substantially less relevant than he was four years ago -- protest and reform type candidacies tend to do a lot less well in times of economic prosperity," Mr. Stone said. "Secondly, his chameleon-like change into a religious right candidate is not very credible. This is a guy who was pro-choice just a few years ago."
Mr. Stone said that while Mr. Forbes "can play again the role of damaging the eventual nominee," he would ultimately realize that "he's throwing good money after bad."
Still, most Republicans -- and certainly his rivals -- are taking Mr. Forbes much more seriously than four years ago, when his declaration of candidacy drew little attention. At the time Mr. Dole, hardly threatened, welcomed Mr. Forbes into the race with a quip: "I think it will help the economy."

HEADLINE: School for Violent Students Faces Objections in Queens

BYLINE: By VIVIAN S. TOY 

 BODY:
The Board of Education hopes to place 100 of the city's most violent students in a new school inside the former Swingline factory in Long Island City, Queens, but residents and local officials worry that such a school would hamper the neighborhood's budding resurgence.
School officials are negotiating a lease to transform about a third of one floor in the defunct stapler factory into a Second Opportunity School for troubled middle and high school students from throughout Queens. The school, which would house students who have taken weapons to school or who have been involved in serious assaults, would be the third of six that Chancellor Rudy Crew plans to open in the city. The plans for the school were first reported yesterday in Newsday. 
 Long Island City residents and local officials said yesterday that they were angry that school officials did not discuss the plans with the community before entering into negotiations for the space. In addition to concerns about bringing potentially disruptive students into the neighborhood, they said, they fear that the school would take space that could be used to attract manufacturers.
"This is an area that is already oversaturated with high schools," said City Councilman Walter McCaffrey, who represents Long Island City, adding that there are seven high schools within a 10-block radius of the Swingline building. "Are we killing off economic development by putting a high school in space that should be used for private commerce?"
For decades, Long Island City had seen factories close and jobs disappear. Only recently have smaller manufacturing companies started to replace the old assembly lines that once ran around the clock.
Dr. Crew proposed Second Opportunity Schools in 1997 as a replacement for the Crossroads Academy, which since 1995 has brought the school system's most violent students under one roof in the Bronx. The Chancellor had said he hoped that creating special schools closer to the homes of those students -- in the Bronx, Brooklyn and Queens -- would increase their chances of succeeding in school, but his plans have been stalled by the difficulty of finding appropriate locations.
"It is always difficult to find space in urban settings, that goes without saying," said Chiara Coletti, the Chancellor's spokeswoman. "And then we've had the added component of community opposition to these types of schools in particular."
She said the schools are designed to be small academies that use a relatively large adult staff to work with a small number of students. The two schools that have opened in the Bronx, for example, have 1 teacher for every 15 students, compared with the citywide average of 1 teacher for every 34 high school students, as well as a host of counselors to deal with the students' many needs.
"These are very small schools with very close supervision, and frankly, that's not threatening," she said. "We also must remember that these are still children and we have an obligation to educate them and prepare them for life."
Cathryn Keeshan, co-president of the United Forties Civic Association, which represents the area around the Swingline factory, said school officials should have laid out their plans to neighborhood groups to allay their fears.
"This has not been adequately discussed with the community at all," she said. "It would be wrong for me to form a judgment that these kids are going to be disruptive because I don't have the adequate information. But if they haven't responded well to other youngsters, you have to wonder: Will they harass or taunt people going into the area?"
Mr. McCaffrey said he hoped to get assurances from the Board of Education that the school would not take in more than 100 students and that the students could be brought to the school by school bus to avoid further taxing subway and city bus lines. He has also asked that the students use a back entrance to the building on Skillman Avenue, away from the Y.M.C.A. that just opened last month across the street.
Larry Smith, a spokesman for Sholom and Zuckerbrot, the leasing agent for the new owners of the Swingline building, Stellar Management of Manhattan, said the factory's four floors would be rented to three or four tenants, most likely industrial companies. He said the owners would decide on whether to lease space to the Board of Education within the next month. He said converting 30,000 square feet of the building's 285,000 square feet into a school would probably cost the city about $1 million.
A spokeswoman for the Museum of Modern Art in Manhattan said the museum was negotiating to buy a Swingline factory annex south of Queens Boulevard. But she said having a Second Opportunity School across the street would not be a concern for the museum because the museum planned to use the site for storage and offices, not as a public space.

HEADLINE: New Sports and Retail Complex Is Proposed for the Meadowlands

BYLINE: By CHARLES V. BAGLI 

DATELINE: EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J., March 16

 BODY:
Even as the Nets and Devils develop plans for new arenas elsewhere in the state, the New Jersey Sports and Exposition Authority today proposed building a new $212 million home for the teams in the Meadowlands and replacing the existing arena with a giant entertainment complex.
The proposed basketball and hockey arena would be built alongside Giants Stadium, while the 18-year-old Continental Airlines Arena would be demolished. As part of creating what the Sports Authority called a "sports epicenter," the new retail and entertainment complex would feature halls of fame, sports restaurants like ESPN Zone, movie theaters and retailers like Nike Town that allow patrons to try out the sporting goods. 
 Even though the Sports and Exposition Authority, a quasi-public agency that runs the sports complex, made an elaborate presentation in describing its effort, the plan serves mainly as the Meadowlands' opening bid in determining a future home for the Nets and the Devils.
It comes a week after John McMullen, the owner of the Devils hockey team, released his own plan for a $350 million hockey arena and entertainment complex in Hoboken. Raymond Chambers and the other new owners of the Nets have said they intend to move the basketball team to a new arena in Newark as part of a plan to revive the state's largest city.
"There'll be discussions with the two franchises to see whether this vision is part of their future," said Dennis R. Robinson, president of the Sports Authority. "I think this plan creates the ultimate sports and entertainment destination that would benefit all the teams. It's up to them."
If the Nets and Devils leave the Meadowlands, Mr. Robinson said that the Sports Authority would still demolish the Continental Airlines Arena and develop the retail and entertainment complex.
Howard J. Rubenstein, a spokesman for the Nets, declined comment. Mr. McMullen was out of town and could not be reached for comment.
Mr. Robinson said that Gov. Christine Todd Whitman's first goal was to insure that New Jersey remained home to the Nets and the Devils, as well as the Giants, the Jets and the MetroStars soccer team, all of which now play in the Meadowlands.
In recent months, the Nets have tried to woo Mr. McMullen, but he has steadfastly resisted any notion of moving the Devils to Newark. Still, there are ample political and economic reasons for the teams to cooperate, be it in Newark, Hoboken or the Meadowlands.
Sports analysts say that an arena is economically viable only when it is used by more than one team.
At the same time, it is unlikely that Mrs. Whitman will provide state aid for more than one arena. Although each project would involve at least some private financing, the teams and the Sports and Exposition Authority want the state to provide highway and other transportation improvements.
"You can't build two single-team arenas; the Governor's pretty firm about that," said Raymond H. Bateman, chairman of the Sports Authority.
The Nets contend that any transportation improvements in Newark, unlike the Meadowlands, would also benefit local commuters. A Newark arena would also be close to mass transit, highways and downtown development opportunities.
"There's a broad public benefit in Newark," said one business executive who supports the Nets' move and who spoke only on the condition of anonymity. "On any given night, try finding a parking space for dinner in Hoboken, let alone a sports event."
Designed by Ronald F. Turner, a principal at NBBJ of Los Angeles, the proposed sports arena would seat 18,436 fans for hockey and 19,136 for basketball. The most significant features of the sleek oval structure are mainly about increased revenue for the teams and higher costs for the fans: as many as 100 luxury suites (up from 29 at the Continental Arena), 2,666 premium seats and a private club.
Michael Rubin, a sports and entertainment consultant with MRA International in Philadelphia, said the 600,000-square-foot retail and entertainment complex he designed would be a centerpoint for the teams that make their home at the Meadowlands complex.
"This is the last best site to create a sports themed entertainment and leisure destination," Mr. Rubin said.
Preston Robert Tisch, co-owner of the Giants, welcomed plans to demolish the Continental Arena. "It just doesn't work in today's world," Mr. Tisch said. "It's an underused piece of land. You need more boxes, restaurants and income coming in."
Both buildings would be privately financed, but the Sports and Exposition Authority said the state would consider about $72 million in parking garages and traffic improvements to local highways.
Mr. Robinson said the proposal was building on a 23-year record of success at the Meadowlands complex, which had $116 million in gross ticket sales last year and generated an estimated $1.4 billion in economic activity.
But that does not mean that the Meadowlands Sports Complex is a moneymaking operation. The complex once generated surplus revenue for state coffers after paying operating expenses and debt service.
But in recent years, the state has had to provide tens of millions of dollars to cover shortfalls, because of a decline in the popularity of horse racing and because of competition from Atlantic City casinos. In 1999, the Sports Authority expects that it will need about $29 million to break even.

Unemployment Milestone

 BODY:
New Jersey's preliminary unemployment rate for February was 4.1 percent, its lowest level in a decade and the first time it has dipped below the national rate since 1991, the State Labor Department announced yesterday.
The rate, which may later be adjusted up or down depending on additional employment indicators, declined steeply from January's level of 4.4 percent, said Kevin Smith, a spokesman for the Labor Department. He said the state posted a net gain of 9,200 jobs last month, with the strongest gains in health care and social and business services. "All these numbers are subject to change," he said, "but these look pretty good." 
 It was in July 1989 that the state last had a monthly rate of 4.1 percent, Mr. Smith said.
Preliminary unemployment figures for October had placed New Jersey's rate one-tenth of one percentage point lower than the nation's, but adjusted figures later reversed the order. This time, Mr. Smith said, the state was three-tenths of a percentage point lower than the nation's February rate of 4.4 percent, and state analysts are confident that even the adjusted rate will be lower than the national one.
The last time the state's unemployment rate was below the nation's was in 1991, during a recession -- the state rate of 7.1 percent dipped below the national rate of 7.2 percent.

HEADLINE: Russia to Offer U.S. Deal To End Iran Nuclear Aid

BYLINE: By MICHAEL R. GORDON 

DATELINE: MOSCOW, March 16

 BODY:
Russia has offered to curtail nuclear cooperation with Iran if Washington ends sanctions against two leading Russian nuclear research centers, Russia's Atomic Energy Minister says.
The proposal comes as Prime Minister Yevgeny M. Primakov prepares for critical talks in Washington next week on security issues and Russian appeals for billions of dollars in credits from the International Monetary Fund. 
 The minister made the disclosure in an interview on Monday.
The aim of the Russian proposal is to remove a major irritant in relations with the West and unlock valuable contracts to the nation's hard-strapped nuclear institutes.
Senior Clinton Administration officials said that Yevgeny Adamov, the Atomic Energy Minister, had presented the plan to American officials last week and that the two sides are trying to hammer out an agreement by the Primakov meeting.
"It would help with the overall tone of our relationship," an Administration official said. "Adamov is taking the initiative and appears to have Primakov's support. But we still have a paper to negotiate."
Mr. Adamov's proposal addresses one of Washington's main fears: that Russia may expand its nuclear cooperation with Teheran. Russia is already planning to build several nuclear power reactors at Bushire in Iran. While American officials object to that project, they are even more worried that Russia will also provide Iran with heavy water and graphite reactors, which are useful in producing plutonium for nuclear bombs.
Fears that Russia might be broadening its nuclear trade with Iran to include heavy water and graphite technology led the United States in January to impose sanctions against the Scientific Research and Design Institute for Power Technology, also known as Nikiet, and the Mendeleyev University of Chemical Technology.
Russian nuclear cooperation with Iran is also a major Israeli concern.
The sanctions were an especially embarrassing for the Russians since Mr. Adamov used to be the head of the research institute.
"Nikiet is really at the center of our concern," said an American expert. "It is the principal Russian entity that could provide assistance beyond Bushire. If we can address Nikiet we have made a very significant step."
Mr. Adamov's plan, in theory, would do precisely that. Mr. Adamov said he wanted to sign a document in Washington affirming that the institute has cut off all contact with Iran.
In return, the United States would lift sanctions against the institute. A similar agreement, Mr. Adamov said, could be worked out for Mendeleyev University.
A procedure would be established to discuss future disputes about the provision of Russian nuclear technology to Iran, according to Mr. Adamov's proposal. But Russia would not abandon its plan to build reactors at Bushire.
Mr. Adamov said he had already instructed the institute to sunder its ties with Iran. American officials said, however, that there were signs the contacts were continuing.
Strapped for cash and eager to maintain a modicum of cooperation with Washington, Iran is just one nuclear issue where the Russians are hoping for a breakthrough.
A compromise also has already been worked out concerning 16 advanced I.B.M. computers the Russians obtained in 1996 in violation of American export controls. The Russians obtained the computers using Moscow-based middlemen and installed them in the closed city of Arzamas-16, a design center for Russia's nuclear arsenal.
The Clinton Administration initially asked that the computers be returned. Under the compromise, the computers have quietly been moved from a military site to a civilian site within the city: a building used by Sberbank, a Government bank.
The computers are to be used for civilian purposes like the development of commercial software, according to the new arrangement. The compromise plan was overseen by Siegfried Hecker, the former director of the Los Alamos National Laboratory, who quietly visited Russia to help put it in place.
American officials hope to work out a similar arrangement for an SP-2 I.B.M. computer, which American officials suspect has also been delivered to Arzamas, for a high-performance computer system from Silicon Graphics, which is at the nuclear design center at Chelyabinsk.
There has been progress on other fronts as well. Officials hope to conclude arrangements that would ease the sale to international companies of billions of dollars worth of low-enriched uranium derived from Russian nuclear warheads. An agreement was worked on in 1993 but has been thwarted by commercial and legal problems.
Iran, however, has been the most contentious issue. There is no surprise why the Russians are anxious to see the sanctions lifted. If they are not removed, the sanctions would deprive Nikiet of several million dollars worth of work, a considerable setback for the cash-poor institute.
Washington also has an interest in resolving the issue. The institute, which designed the type of reactor involved in the accident at Chernobyl, is helping to improve the safety of Russia's nuclear power complex, a task Washington has supported.
United States Energy Department officials have been so worried about the safety implications of the sanctions that they secretly appealed to the White House, asking that some exceptions be made so that important safety work could go forward, American officials said.
Russia has also taken some steps to cut off contracts on the sale of missile technology to Iran, but much more needs to be done, American officials said.
One issue is whether the institute has, in fact, stopped its contacts with Iran, as Mr. Adamov contends it has.
Explaining the contacts, Mr. Adamov said the institute had prepared a contract for the sale of a research reactor to Iran. Mendeleyev University, he insisted, has provided some basic unclassified information on heavy water technology, while recommending that Iran purchase a light-water reactor.
Mr. Adamov said that the Russian Government had rejected his proposal to sell the research reactor to Iran and that the institute no longer has dealings with the Iranians. That, he insisted, should lay the basis for an agreement in Washington.
"I do believe in American pragmatism," he said. "This is a chance to check if these people are pragmatic, though I am afraid of some angry people in the State Department. They are somewhat narrow-minded."

 CORRECTION:
A headline on Wednesday about a Russian effort to end United States sanctions on two Russian nuclear research centers, imposed because of concerns about aid to Iran, misstated the Russian offer. Russia offered to curtail nuclear cooperation with Iran, not to end it.

HEADLINE: Why We Shouldn't Write Off Russia

BYLINE: By Anatol Lieven; Anatol Lieven is an editor at the International Institute for Strategic Studies and the author of "Chechnya: Tombstone of Russian Power."

DATELINE: LONDON

 BODY:
When the Russian Prime Minister, Yevgeny Primakov, visits Washington next week, he and President Clinton will have to confront this incongruity: The International Monetary Fund needs to renew lending to Russia not so Russia can finally reform itself, but mainly so that it can repay the I.M.F. It's an absurd situation, but international finance is like that.
The I.M.F. suspended its loans to Russia last year after Russia's devaluation and partial default, and after a long record of false promises and failed reforms. Now the I.M.F. is deciding whether to release the rest of the $22.6 billion in loans. Without the money, there is no chance whatsoever that Russia will be able to repay the approximately $4.8 billion it owes this year to the fund and the World Bank. 
 Russia's failure to pay its loans would mean a collapse of relations with both the I.M.F. and the World Bank. In the longer term it would contribute enormously to cutting Russia off from international investment. Except as an exporter of raw materials, Russia would be largely isolated from the world economy. Moreover, the West would have lost one of its few remaining levers to influence Russian behavior on the world stage.
Russia would join the exclusive club of only seven countries that have ever defaulted on their debts to the main international financial institutions. Of these seven, four -- including Iraq and Sudan -- are considered "rogue" states, and three -- Liberia, Congo and Somalia -- are "failed" states.
And this reality should indeed be the West's bottom line when it comes to deciding whether to support continued I.M.F. lending in spite of Russia's appalling record of economic management. There are two key questions. Is it in our interest that the Russian central state should collapse? And do we think -- as do many Republican politicians, like Representative Benjamin Gilman of New York, chairman of the House International Relations Committee -- that Russia's international behavior has already been so bad that the United States should in effect classify Russia as a "rogue" state and actively welcome its isolation?
The answer to both questions should be no. We cannot now "win" Russia, either as a successful convert to free market reform or as an obedient member of an American-led international security order. Probably we never could. But we can still help the Russian central state retain some form of effective power over its territory, and we can still keep Russia from going "rogue."
First of all, though, we need to shed the hypocritical illusion that I.M.F. decisions on lending to Russia (or to certain other countries, like Ukraine) are, should be or have been dictated chiefly by the I.M.F.'s own rules. By those criteria, for years now Russia should not have received a cent.
It is no secret that the chief reason the I.M.F. lent to Russia in 1995 and '96 is that leading Western governments insisted on it. Much I.M.F. lending in the past cannot really be said to have been to Russia as a country -- it was to the Yeltsin regime, especially in the run-up to the 1996 elections.
As a result, the I.M.F., willingly or unwillingly, turned a blind eye to two utterly disastrous policies intended to win Mr. Yeltsin those elections: the huge grant of tax breaks and exemptions to businesses, regions and municipalities, and the "loans for shares" program under which leading bankers were given Russia's most valuable oil and minerals companies for a fraction of their value, in return for their financial and political support for President Yeltsin. These two policies lie at the heart of the collapse of Russia's revenue-raising capacity, and the West's acquiescence -- or even complicity -- in them gives the I.M.F.'s current calls for tougher Russian budgets and taxation a bitter ring.
In any case, greater budgetary austerity and serious economic reform are for the moment virtually impossible: wages to state employees are up to a year in arrears, and the armed forces, health service and educational system are all crumbling. The patience of the Russian people is legendary, but further cuts may lead to political destabilization and the destruction of what central influence remains over important provinces, which depend on subsidies from Moscow.
The state does of course desperately need to raise more tax revenue and stop the leaching away of state money through corruption. But rhetorical promises of tax reform made to the I.M.F. and the West are meaningless when many tax inspectors also work for organized crime. In addition, cutting down the ability of the "oligarchs" to extract financial support from the state (in the form of bailouts, for instance) is essential, but it would involve great dangers for Russia's political stability, since they still hold substantial power.
Thus building up the state's capacity to again play an effective economic role will be the work of years. During that time, even successful economic reform would yield little in the critically important area of direct foreign investment, given Russia's record and the general international mood regarding emerging markets.
So for the foreseeable future, the most important task of the desperately sick central state will be simply to survive. And there can be no doubt that it is in our interest that it do so. It is a cliche but a true one: the greatest dangers for the West today come not from Russian strength but from Russian weakness. When, for example, American politicians of both parties stress our critical interest in the security of Russia's nuclear weapons and materials, they are doing no more than pointing out an obvious truth.
As to the argument that Russia is already in effect a rogue state, this collapses as soon as Russia is compared with the real rogues. Russia in the 1990's did, after all, withdraw its troops from the areas of greatest Western interest, Central Europe and the Baltic states. It has reached a peaceful compromise with its most important neighbor, Ukraine. And it has neither sponsored international terrorism nor invaded an independent neighbor. Although much of Russian foreign policy may well have been deeply irritating to the United States, it is not clear that in practice it was more hostile to real American interests than the policies of, say, India, with whom the United States nonetheless maintains pragmatic, useful relations without either illusions or hysteria.
Finally, it is worth noting that some of those who seem intent on flogging the half-dead Russian bear -- Henry Kissinger and Zbigniew Brzezinski, for instance -- also advocate amicable American relations with China. But the events of recent weeks suggest that China will be no friend of the United States any time soon. In such a climate, driving Russia away from the West would violate the rules of geopolitics as laid down by Dr. Kissinger himself; indeed, an alliance between Russian military technology and Chinese numbers would be one of the few things that might in the long term prove a real threat to American hegemony.
This makes it worth our while to prevent Russia's isolation -- and if that requires more money from the I.M.F., that is really not a large price to pay.

HEADLINE: GAME THEORY;
On 2067 Battleground, 1999 Political Passions

BYLINE: By J. C. Herz; E-mail address: Herz@nytimes.com

 BODY:
THE year is 2067, and the United Nations Starship Unity hurtles through space. Behind it: Earth, ravaged by war, famine and disease. Ahead: a planet orbiting Alpha Centauri, where humankind can make a new start. Aboard: thousands of cryogenically frozen men and women with the skills to create a new society.
Of course, things go disastrously awry. A reactor malfunction destroys the ship's communications equipment and thaws the passengers ahead of schedule. Aboard a damaged ship, with no way to re-establish contact with Earth, the command team argues about how best to proceed. Without consensus, chaos ensues. Factions consolidate around the seven most powerful leaders, each of whom has a different vision of how society should function in the new world. As the planet rises in the near distance, the ship splits along ideological lines, with each faction boarding a separate landing pod to the planet's surface. 
 Thus begins Sid Meier's Alpha Centauri, a strategy game that marries Sim City to Frank Herbert's "Dune." Unlike most strategy games, in which all players have the same agenda (economic dominance or military conquest), Alpha Centauri simulates a complex competitive world where agendas often diverge.
Each faction plays by a different set of rules, based on its values, economic behavior and political philosophy. The Gaians, for instance, are die-hard Greens led by a lissome Scottish botanist. Appalled by the environmental atrocities on Earth, they are determined to live in harmony with the planet. They are incredibly good at harnessing natural resources in a sustainable fashion. They are fabulously efficient and highly democratic. They are also pacifists. That becomes a problem.
Contrast that with Morgan Industries, led by a Namibian diamond tycoon whose only goal is untrammeled economic growth. The Morganites' values are corporate, and their ideology is unfettered laissez-faire capitalism. They require lots of resources to sustain their high standard of living, and a healthy police force to keep the underclass from burning down their luxury high-rises. But they don't like war either. It's bad for business.
War is no problem for the Lord's Believers, a fundamentalist group whose leader hails from the Christian States of America. Hostile acts against nonbelievers send morale through the roof. But because its value system is based on faith, rather than knowledge, the group has trouble developing new technology.
At the University of Planet, new technology is a way of life. Led by a Russian cybernetics genius, these are the hackers, the techno-utopians and pure scientists with fast network access and really cool toys who believe that research and development will solve everything. Open networks accelerate the pace of discovery. Unfortunately, they also make those discoveries easy to steal, but hey, information wants to be free.
In the Human Hive, an atheist, totalitarian collective, information is never free. By order of Chairman Sheng-Ji Yang, private property and civil rights have been abolished. Any individual sacrifice is justified for the greater good. Housed in underground fortresses, the Hive is a paragon of centralized control: xenophobic, disciplined and heavily armed.
In contrast, the Spartan Federation, rallied by the ship's chief of security, is a highly decentralized group of paramilitary survivalists whose only binding philosophy is the right to bear arms.
And finally, there is the Peacekeeping Forces, whose East Indian commissioner hews to the United Nations' humanitarian, democratic ideals -- and battles the plague of bureaucratic inefficiency.
As the leader of any given faction, you explore the planet, build cities, conduct research and confront other groups. You may resolve the inevitable conflicts diplomatically. If you are suitably equipped, you may also wipe rival factions off the face of the map. You can violate treaties. You can lie. You can commit atrocities, if you're willing to make enemies and incur sanctions. You can spark dissent. Or you can cooperate to achieve a higher goal -- engineering a global trade agreement, solving an environmental crisis or pulling off a project that no single group can achieve on its own.
How you play depends on what you're trying to win. You can win a standard military victory by conquering everyone. You can win a diplomatic victory by getting yourself elected planetary governor. Or you can achieve economic dominance by cornering the world energy market. Alternately, you can shoot for Ascent to Transcendence, the ultimate stage of human evolution -- a spiritual triumph that requires staggering amounts of technology.
When different players strive for different kinds of victory, the game becomes something more than king of the hill or Monopoly. It gets complicated -- and interesting. There are natural alliances and natural antipathies and shifting constituencies, sudden betrayals and conciliatory back-scratching. There are questions about expediency and questions about trust, particularly when you're playing against other human beings in real time -- or on-line games that involve a combination of human beings and computer opponents.
"On line, people mostly gang up on the computer," said Mr. Meier, who has only recently turned to science fiction after designing historical simulation games like Gettysburg and Civilization. "They band together to beat the artificial intelligence. And then when they've beaten the computer, they'll go after each other.
"But sometimes, maybe they're so invested in building these cities and getting their societies up and running that they don't want it to end. But when someone wins, by conquest or ascent or whatever, that's it, the game's over. The world goes away. So someone says, 'Hold off, I'm working on a really cool technology right now, let's just keep it going.' If someone looks like he's going to win militarily, they just all keep him from doing that. They agree not to end the game."
In on-line geopolitics, sometimes a stalemate is as good as it gets.

HEADLINE: Fed Sees Continuing Strong Growth With Low Inflation

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 17

 BODY:
The economy's run of strong growth and low inflation shows few signs of changing, the Federal Reserve's latest regional survey showed today.
The Fed cited rising consumer spending, higher vehicle sales, expanded manufacturing, gains in construction and a pickup in business lending as evidence that the eight-year economic expansion continues. 
 If anything, what little inflation there is may be abating. "Low commodity prices and a perceived lack of pricing power by firms helped keep prices stable during January and February," said the report, commonly known as the beige book. Prices were "generally steady" in all districts, except for that served by the Dallas Federal Reserve Bank, where "price declines outnumbered price increases."
At the same time, the Fed said companies reported difficulty finding qualified workers and said wages were rising faster than in previous months. The survey also showed "some further gains in economic activity in January and February, despite weakness in agriculture and a few manufacturing industries."
The report found strength in consumer spending and said retail sales were "substantially higher than a year ago." At the same time, "inventories were balanced and in line with future sales expectations," the report said.
The regional outlook is based on reports from the Fed's 12 district banks. It is published eight times each year. The latest edition was compiled by the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond based on data collected before March 8.
The report will help form the basis for discussion on the target interest rate on overnight loans between banks at the March 30 meeting of the Fed's policy-setting panel, the Federal Open Market Committee.
Among the few trouble spots the report cited, it noted that "foreign competition and low energy prices depressed textile, apparel and energy-related industries."
In addition, it said, "agriculture continued to be plagued by low farm commodity prices, and an increasing number of farmers were under financial stress."
In one inflation-related comment, the report said, "finding qualified workers has become more difficult in several districts, and reports of faster wage increases were more widespread than in recent months." Still, it said, "several districts said that businesses remain reluctant to press for price increases."
The economy will grow at a 2.5 percent to 3 percent pace this year and the Consumer Price Index will rise by 2 percent to 2.5 percent, the Fed said. In addition, the central bank expects the unemployment rate to stay close to its current level throughout the next two years, ranging between 4.25 percent and 4.5 percent.

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
Protecting a patient's rights without inviting lawsuits.

BYLINE: By Michael M. Weinstein 

 BODY:
WHO should control patient care -- doctors at the patient's bedside or doctors working for the patient's insurance company? The Senate Labor Committee appears poised to answer "neither" when it votes this week on patient protections.
The committee plans to turn the ultimate decision in cases where bedside physicians and insurance companies disagree over to expert panels, some at faraway academic medical centers. Exactly how to carry out external review remains controversial. But if the idea is handled creatively, it could sweep away the brawl over legal liability that doomed last year's efforts to pass a patients' "bill of rights." 
 Democrats and Republicans acknowledge the need to respond to patient complaints that health plans persistently deny them reimbursement for necessary medical care. The number of such complaints is small, but the ones with merit can reflect callous behavior by health plans. The Democrats have led the way in proposing changes. Until now, they have focused on giving patients covered at work the right, largely prohibited under current law, to sue health plans for economic and punitive damages. But that almost certainly won't fly, given that a Republican-controlled Congress is highly unlikely to approve what would amount to a trial lawyers relief act.
So what's the alternative? Some advocates admit privately that the right to sue may not be necessary, at least for the near future, if Congress passes two other provisions as part of an overall bill. The first would guarantee that patients could appeal denials to an outside panel of experts. The second, recently proposed by two Senators, Jack Reed, Democrat of Rhode Island, and Ron Wyden, Democrat of Oregon, would have states set up networks of counselors to guide patients through appeals to their plan and to external panels.
Though the principle of mandatory external review garners bipartisan support, actual proposals do not. The Democrats propose defining medically necessary care in law, using what might be called a prudent doctor test: Is the doctor following generally accepted principles of professional medical practice. The Democrats would prohibit plans from arbitrarily interfering with the decision of the treating physician. What could be wrong with those standards?
"Plenty," replies Karen Ignagni, president of the American Association of Health Plans, which represents about 1,000 private managed-care plans. She says the Democratic language, though saying it leaves the decision up to expert panels, "in fact stops them, as well as the health plan, from reviewing whether decisions by physicians are medically appropriate."
Dr. Robert H. Brook of RAND Health recently testified, after reviewing dozens of studies, that "20 to 30 percent of the care given to patients is unnecessary," yet "patients do not receive perhaps as many as one-third of services they should receive." Ms. Ignagni fears that the Democrats' bill would insulate customary, often wasteful, practices from challenge.
Mary Nell Lehnhard of the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association, agrees. "If the plans are forced to prove that each inappropriate treatment is in fact inappropriate, we will turn back the clock to the days of unnecessary overtreatment and unchecked medical inflation," she says.
So how should expert panels make decisions in a world where physician practices vary widely? Should the burden of providing proof be placed on the plan or the physician? Because scientific evidence is often indecisive, the side that bears the burden of proof may often lose the appeal.
David Richardson, president of an organization that performs external review for Medicare enrollees and private plans, would ordinarily allow plans to choose treatments from among those customarily practiced unless the panel found that the treatment was inappropriate.
The bill proposed by James M. Jeffords of Vermont, the Republican chairman of the Senate Labor Committee, answers the question by not answering the question. He would not define medical necessity or place the burden of proof on either side, essentially leaving it up to the expert panels to decide by a preponderance of the scientific and medical evidence, however murky.
The new wrinkle in the debate is the emergence of managed-care leaders who embrace external review. President Michael Stocker of Empire Blue Cross and Blue Shield of New York State says that external panels of experts can be trusted to make the right decisions if they are held up to professional scrutiny because "there usually is general agreement." Dr. Arthur Leibowitz, medical director of Aetna U.S. Healthcare, which already offers enrollees the right to external appeal, agrees, though he opposes Federal mandates.
Mandating external appeal is only part of the solution, Senator Wyden says. The Reed-Wyden bill, supported by patient advocates like Ron Pollack, executive director of Families USA Foundation, would turn money over to the states to set up networks of counselors to help steer patients through appeals. The idea, Mr. Wyden says, "is to intervene early, resolving modest-sized grievances in a nonadversarial way before they mushroom into huge grievances that need costly litigation." Supporters of the proposal expect it to soften the controversy over litigation by largely eliminating the need to take health plans to court if and when Congress makes that possible.

HEADLINE: Raise in the House May Be Desirable, but a Vote on It Isn't

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 17

 BODY:
There are few things members of Congress want more than a raise and little they like less than to be seen voting one for themselves.
This year Representative Bill Thomas, the California Republican who is chairman of the committee that sets the rules for expense accounts, began shopping around for a way to solve the conundrum. 
 Mr. Thomas proposed having his committee change the rules so that representatives, if they chose to, could pocket a portion of their expense accounts tax free in the form of a $125 per diem. The matter would never have to come to a vote.
But The Hill, a weekly newspaper about Congress, got wind of the plan and published an account of it today. By this afternoon, it stood about as much chance of being carried out as a surtax on comb-overs.
"This dog ain't going to hunt," said a top staff assistant who had taken soundings on the issue.
Mr. Thomas, who heads the Committee on House Administration, did not return telephone calls. He issued a statement tonight saying that his committee would consider the per diem proposal only if it had the approval of the leadership of both parties. Which by then it clearly did not.
John P. Feehery, a spokesman for Speaker J. Dennis Hastert, said the Speaker had not endorsed the plan.
Laura Nichols, a spokeswoman for Representative Richard A. Gephardt, the Democratic leader, said Mr. Gephardt had told the Speaker he would think about the proposal but would support it only if a vote was allowed.
In 1989, Congress thought it had solved the pay problem once and for all.
Under a measure passed that year, lawmakers became entitled to an automatic annual raise -- 0.5 percentage points less than the employment cost index, a measure of inflation that many businesses use to give their workers cost of living raises.
For a few years, this worked. But almost every year since 1993, one representative or another has proposed that the raise be blocked. That required a vote. And except for 1997, the lawmakers denied themselves the automatic pay increase.
Representatives and senators now make $136,700 a year. They also get an expense account, or representational allowance, that ranges from $859,000 to $1.3 million. The money is used for rents and other office expenses, air fares home and other costs.
The actual amount is based on factors including how far their district is from Washington and how much it costs to rent office space in their districts.
Under Mr. Thomas's plan, representatives would have been permitted to dip into this account and pay themselves $125 every day the House was in session. If the House met 160 days during a year -- an average of four days a week for 40 weeks -- that would amount to $20,000.
Per diems are common practice in state legislatures, where salaries are generally lower. In his statement, Mr. Thomas said he had often been asked by colleagues why the House did not have a similar allowance.
"It is a good question, which is why members of both parties have discussed this," he said.

HEADLINE: Worldwide Chip Sales Up 1.2% in January

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: SAN JOSE, Calif., March 17

 BODY:
Worldwide semiconductor sales rose 1.2 percent in January from a year earlier, as rising demand in Europe and much of Asia offset lower sales in the Americas.
Chip sales for January rose to $11.1 billion from $10.97 billion in January 1998. Sales for the month were 1.9 percent less than December. January sales are usually lower than those in December, according to the Semiconductor Industry Association. 
 Sales in the Americas fell 2.7 percent in January from a year earlier. European sales rose 2.8 percent, while sales in Asia other than Japan were up 9.1 percent, the association said. Sales in Japan fell 2.5 percent.
The association's president, George Scalise, said in a statement that in Asia "economic reforms brought on by the financial crisis are taking effect."
"January's sales," he said, "reflect a continuation of the strength of semiconductor sales that began to emerge in the fourth quarter."

HEADLINE: Russia's Patchwork Economy;
KoreanCompanies, Chinese Workers and U.S. Entree

BYLINE: By RUSSELL WORKING 

DATELINE: VLADIVOSTOK, Russia, March 17

 BODY:
It is well after dark on a recent evening, but the red brick garment factory on a bluff overlooking the Sea of Japan is ablaze with light. From inside the building comes a haunting song, unfamiliar in this overwhelmingly Russian city: the seamstresses are singing in Chinese.
Of the many incongruities born of the increasingly complex global economy, this may be among the strangest. For here at Russia's eastern extremity, Chinese workers labor alongside Russians making clothes for a South Korean company, which put its factory here partly to do an end run around United States quotas on apparel imports. 
 And Russia, which had visions of reinventing itself as a world-class market economy, now finds itself in the company of nations like Indonesia and El Salvador, attractive to outside investors in part for its rock-bottom wages. Seamstresses here often work six days a week, and for as little as 11 cents an hour.
The factory is owned by S. H. International, one of a growing number of South Korean companies making clothes in Russia, in this case T-shirts and sweatshirts, that often end up in American stores like the Gap.
Similar factories have popped up in 10 cities in the Russian Far East, from the hardscrabble town of Partizansk, where three of the four coal mines have closed in the last two years, to Vladivostok, a port city of 700,000 that until 1992 was off-limits to foreigners.
American apparel companies have long farmed out work to manufacturers in low-wage countries. But in an elaborate global system known as the Multi-Fiber Arrangement, which is supposed to be dismantled by 2005, the United States, like Europe, established restrictions on imports from countries whose exports were thought to threaten the domestic apparel industry. South Korean textile companies, limited by American quotas for decades, have sent their cloth to be sewn in faraway factories in the Caribbean and Latin America, which face no such quotas. But now South Koreans are finding a new place to set up shop.
"Through other countries such as Russia you can enter the United States essentially through the back door," said Charles Kernaghan, director of the National Labor Committee, an industry watchdog group based in New York.
For Russia, the apparel companies are a double-edged sword. They provide jobs in a region desperate for investment, and in some cases they reopen closed Soviet-era factories. But some critics fear that the presence of Chinese laborers living on factory grounds is an invitation for the sweatshop conditions common to many South Korean factories in Latin America.
"There's not much good in the whole arrangement, but there's a deficit of jobs here," said Aleksandr Prosekov, deputy chairman of the Committee for Industry in the Primorye Regional Administration, which includes Vladivostok. "At least they pay salaries regularly."
The United States is unlikely to object to the imports from Russia. A Commerce Department official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said the practice was legal as long as there was "substantial transformation" of the clothing in Russia. Furthermore, she said, the United States will not impose any serious quotas on Russia as long as imports do not harm American industry. While the United States does set limits on imports of women's and girls' coats, there are no such limits on the production of clothing of the sort made here, polo shirts, sweatshirts and sweaters, which is growing domestically as well.
Vladivostok is only 440 miles from Seoul, South Korea, but it offers a bargain-rate work force. The average hourly cost of an apparel industry employee in South Korea in 1998 was $2.69, including wages, taxes and benefits, according to industry figures. Though that seems stingy compared with the $10.12 United States average, the average Russian hourly cost is just 56 cents.
The Russian figure is less than half that of Guatemala, where the majority of sewing factories are owned by South Koreans, and comparable to China's, where employers say apparel workers cost an average of 43 cents an hour. But exports from Russia, unlike those from China, face few trade restrictions.
These figures, low as they are, probably do not reflect the true take-home pay, according to the National Labor Committee, which has studied wage rates in China and Latin America. And Eastern workers earn far less than the industry averages for Russia. Russian seamstresses at S. H. International, for example, earned 21 cents an hour on average when the regional administration's Committee for Industry last surveyed local wages in October. The average Chinese worker at S. H. earned 11 cents an hour. S. H.'s general director, Hak J. Lee, declined to discuss specific figures at the factory.
The issue of outsourcing -- farming out work to outside manufacturers -- is a sensitive one for American companies, which have been criticized over labor practices of their producers abroad. A Gap Inc. spokeswoman, Kristy Van Koughnet, declined to answer questions about the company's suppliers in Russia and said that questions relating to employment practices should be addressed to the factories in Russia. "Anything about where we outsource is considered proprietary information," she said.
After a reporter asked about conditions in Russian factories, Gap sent officials to look at several sites. At a plant in Partizansk, workers then began receiving free lunch in the canteen, and the company increased wages. After the raise, one worker said she received $49.56 for a month that included several six-day work weeks.
The apparel makers have set up shop in unlikely places. Partizansk, a town of 65,000 three hours by car from Vladivostok, might not seem an ideal multinational manufacturing and trade center. Pensioners wheezing from black lung disease pick through heaps of stones outside abandoned mine shafts, looking for coal to burn.
But the Seoul-based Seishin Apparel Company bought and remodeled a bankrupt Soviet-era clothing factory there in 1997 for $760,000 to expand sales in America, its general director, Joo In Ha, said. The Russian subsidiary, Koruss, sold $1.68 million worth of sweatshirts, dresses and polo shirts to Gap in 1998.
Vera Karas, a manager at Koruss, said the regional administration initially resisted the company, fearing it might exploit workers. "But that's not going to happen," she said. Ms. Karas, who worked at the factory when it was Russian-owned, said that the Korean owners treated employees well and hired some Russian managers, like her. Since last May, she added, wages have more than doubled. (When figured in dollars, though, they have actually fallen as the ruble collapsed.)
Some 600 cutters, seamstresses and others work at tables in Koruss's warehouse-sized rooms, cutting piles of fabric and sewing dresses, sweatshirts, sweaters and polo shirts. Most of them are Russian women; some of the new hires are Chinese. They regularly work five 9- or 10-hour days, and often spend Saturdays at the sewing machines as well. Koruss employees are paid extra for overtime work, but at S. H. International in Vladivostok, workers said their overtime pay an hour was less than their regular hourly pay.
While filling a big order in November, Koruss employees worked several seven-day weeks, they said. (Ms. Karas said this was untrue.)
"You can only go to the toilet when a bell rings," said a 19-year-old former Koruss employee who quit after a month. "If they catch you talking, you get in trouble." She added: "Sometimes we didn't leave until 7 P.M. For those who have families, I don't know how they do it."
Some employees, however, say the work is very welcome. Lyubov Vonyagina, 54, a veteran seamstress, is part of a team that must produce 1,900 T-shirts a day. When they fall short, they stay late. Still, Ms. Vonyagina says she is not overworked, and she scoffs at younger workers who complain. "They aren't used to hard work," she said.
The decision to hire Chinese workers has stirred up anger in some factory towns. City officials in Artyom, 22 miles north of Vladivostok, have criticized a request by Newmax Apparel of South Korea to hire 75 Chinese workers, the daily Vladivostok newspaper reported on Tuesday. Officials also asked the company to double wages and stop requiring seamstresses to work overtime.
In Partizansk, Koruss imported 75 ethnic Koreans from northeastern China because, said Mr. Joo, the general director, there are simply not enough skilled workers in Partizansk to fill orders. But some townspeople are hostile to the idea.
"We don't need the Chinese here," said Lyudmila Samoilova, 43, a single mother of five who runs a newspaper kiosk across the street from Koruss. "There aren't enough jobs for our own people."
Nina Gudozhnikova, director of the Partizansk office of the federal employment service, worries that because Chinese workers at home put in 12-hour days and get only two days off a month, the South Korean factories in Russia will impose similar schedules on its workers. Still, she approved the factory's labor agreement because the women of Partizansk need jobs. "I signed this agreement with serious doubts," she said.
In Vladivostok, at S. H. International, which is owned by the Sunghan Company, 384 Russians work alongside 218 Chinese employees, according to Sergei Kurakin, chairman of the regional Committee for Industry. Two women from Liaoning province in China said they lived on the plant site and worked about 10 hours a day. Like many Chinese traders and workers in the Russian Far East, they say they will be here only for a short time.
Russian workers said the Chinese struck for two days in December because of low wages. But the Chinese, who said they could get in trouble for talking about their work, declined to discuss the matter. "Basically, I came to Russia out of curiosity, as well as to earn some money," one seamstress said.
At a time when most unpaid Russian workers survive on what they can grow in their gardens or borrow from their pensioner parents, many seamstresses are grateful that South Korean companies are investing in the region. Others say they simply must take whatever work they can get. A 30-year-old mother of two complained of a dirty work environment, and a boss who blocked the doors at S. H. and refused to allow employees to leave at the end of their shift.
Mr. Lee, the general director, said, "I didn't do that." Like other South Korean companies, S. H. said it followed Russian labor laws.
In any case, the worker who complained plans to keep showing up on the job. "We have no choice," she said. "We either have to sit at home and go hungry, or go to work in these conditions."

Chart: "Trade Limits"
To help protect the domestic market against low-priced imports, the United States, like other rich industrial nations, sets controls on a wide variety of apparel and textile goods. These limits, or quotas, have been in place for about 40 years, but are supposed to mostly end by 2005.

HEADLINE: Renault Offer To Nissan Is Questioned

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER 

DATELINE: DETROIT, March 17

 BODY:
Having failed in previous international mergers in the United States and elsewhere, Renault S.A. is encountering considerable skepticism in financial markets following the French auto maker's offer for a large stake in heavily indebted Nissan Motor Company of Japan.
Credit rating agencies said today that they were reviewing Renault's finances, the company's stock fell sharply and investors questioned whether the proposal Renault announced on Tuesday would solve either company's problems. 
 While Mack Trucks has done fairly well since Renault bought it nearly a decade ago, a planned merger with A.B. Volvo fell apart in 1993 after Swedish managers complained that their French colleagues were pushing them around.
Renault's most notable failure in an auto marriage came when it took control of the American Motors Corporation in several stages in the early 1980's. Cultural differences produced managerial chaos. Then Renault sold the company to the Chrysler Corporation in 1987, just a few years before the sport utility vehicle boom made American Motors' Jeep brand one of the most valuable businesses in the auto industry.
Gerald Meyers, a chairman and chief executive of American Motors who quit in 1982 after clashing with Renault, predicted today that Renault and Nissan would not be able to work together. "I can't think of any two cultures that are in more conflicts than these -- they're both not interested in somebody else's ideas," he said.
There is also the question of what Renault sees in Nissan that other auto makers have already dismissed as unworthy of their time. DaimlerChrysler quit talks with Nissan a week ago.
The Ford Motor Company held talks with Nissan about taking a stake earlier this year, but the two sides never even reached the point of exchanging detailed financial information, said auto executives who insisted on anonymity.
Ford's wariness about Nissan reflects the American auto maker's suspicion of Japanese auto maker finances in general. Ford bought 25 percent of Mazda in 1979, but only after increasing its stake to 33.4 percent in 1996, and installing some of its own executives to help run Mazda, did Ford discover that Mazda's dealerships had incurred enormous debts for which Mazda was liable, the auto executives said.
Renault's stock fell 6.2 percent today in trading in Paris, following its announcement late Tuesday that it would seek to buy 35 percent of Nissan, and reportedly offering $5.3 billion for it. Renault's shares have tumbled 28 percent since the company confirmed on Jan. 18 that it wanted to invest in Nissan.
One of the main concerns among credit rating agencies in their review of Renault is Nissan's debt load. Scott Sprinzen, the managing director for auto ratings at Standard & Poor's, said that the agency had concerns about "the extent to which Renault could benefit from an investment in such a financially weak company, and whether the two companies working together could effect an operational turnaround at Nissan."
Estimates of Nissan's debt start at $20 billion but run much higher because no one outside the company knows its full liability for borrowing by various Nissan affiliates. Nissan's shares also fell 1.7 percent in Tokyo today as investors fretted over how long it would take the company to find a partner.
Another issue for auto industry experts today lay in Renault's willingness to take a stake in Nissan without divulging any plan for combining activities and cutting costs. To increase their profits significantly, the two companies must combine vehicle development programs, auto parts purchasing and their distribution of cars and other vehicles, said John A. Casesa, an auto analyst at Schroder & Company.
"To take advantage of four million units of volume, the two companies really have to become one," Mr. Casesa said. "That'll mean head count reductions, a lot of management reshuffling."
Yet Nissan and Renault are each approaching the deal as a way to avoid cutbacks while retaining separate management structures. The French Government owns 44.2 percent of Renault, and the French transport minister, Jean-Claude Gayssot, portrayed the potential business combination today as a way to avoid reductions in staffing.
"I have no concerns about decisions over merging or restructuring," he said. "My concern is that the potential to develop our businesses and our activities should translate into a strengthening of those activities and in the defense and promotion of employment."
Acquiring a large stake in Nissan would make Renault less reliant on the French market. Renault is only now developing sport utility vehicles and luxury sedans, the two market segments in which other global auto makers are making most of their profits, and could tap Nissan's experience in both classes of vehicles. Nissan also has more factories than it needs, and some of this extra capacity could be used to sell Nissan cars through Renault's extensive distribution network in France and elsewhere.
The most profitable auto market in the world now is in the United States, because of the strong economy. But Renault only sells Mack trucks here, and it's unclear to what extent Nissan's American operations will help Renault.
Nissan lost nearly $700 million here last year as it relied too heavily on discounts and offered small, fuel- efficient vehicles that did not sell well because of cheap gas prices.
Nissan's American operations plan to introduce six new or redesigned models later this year and have already reduced inventories and limited discounts, which should make the operations break even this year, said Jason Vines, a company spokesman. But Mr. Casesa said that while Nissan's coming cars were better designed, stiff competition would make a quick financial improvement difficult.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: Market Place;
Signs of Healing in Emerging Markets

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER 

 BODY:
It is like the tree falling in the forest when no one is around. But quietly, some emerging stock markets have turned around after a year in which their sector dropped 25 percent as a whole and some individual markets plunged more than 40 percent.
The Mexican stock market is up 26 percent this year in dollar terms. In India, the market is up 20 percent, also in dollars, while South Africa is up 13 percent. Even Brazil is rebounding for American investors. Its Bovespa index is up 57 percent in local terms and has just moved into the positive category in dollar terms. Three-quarters of one percentage point is not much, but it's far better than the more than 29 percent decline the market rebounded from in January, when the Brazilian currency was devalued. 
 In their local currencies, all four markets are above or near where they were before the Russian debt crisis in August. And when the performance numbers for the first quarter come out, these and other markets are going to be at the top of the list, and the secret will be out.
This rally may not -- and maybe should not -- attract individual investors right away. Last year, according to AMG Data Services, investors pulled $4 billion out of emerging market mutual funds and have withdrawn another $585 million so far this year.
But money managers may have to take a look soon, even if they don't rush in, just because the returns are so fat.
Jay Pelosky, the global emerging-markets strategist at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, argues that managers of global equity funds should consider returning because the extreme volatility in emerging markets, which helped lead to major losses the last year and a half, has begun to decline. In other words, the waters are less turbulent.
Just this week, he recommended moving more money into Brazil, pushing the investment there above Brazil's share of the Latin American market. Earlier this year, he moved to a similar position in Mexico.
"We are still at the cusp of the turn," he said, adding that this year's rallies have so far been propelled by local investors and some speculative money.
So if these money managers do come back, Mr. Pelosky said emerging markets would get a big boost. That is because this is so-called nondedicated money -- the money that does not have to be in emerging markets -- rather than the funds whose mission is to buy stocks there.
Global money managers, he said, should be looking for value stocks, the well-run companies whose prices have been beaten down too far in the indiscriminate flight from Latin America. "There are highly qualified companies that have been battle-tested," he said.
So far, however, he said his clients were still being cautious. "Some are looking and some are kicking the tires," he said. "Some are buying a little, but not much."
Many money managers, he said, are still asking "what kind of damage can emerging markets do to me, not what kind of opportunities there are."
Diego Espinosa, co-manager of the $1.6 billion Scudder Global Fund, is one of those money managers who is again thinking about emerging markets. While he is not jumping in at all, he is kicking the tires, which is a change for him.
What is moving Mr. Espinosa is a marked change in the atmosphere in emerging markets in just the last month and a half, probably best dated from the appointment of Arminio Fraga Neto, a former manager of one of George Soros's biggest investment funds, as the new president of the Brazilian central bank.
From the fear of debt defaults in January, Mr. Fraga and the Brazilian Government are now entertaining proposals from American investment bankers on how to go back to the global bond market to raise new and needed capital. Mexico and Argentina have had successful bond sales. And the two other major Latin American economies have dodged any downdraft from Brazil, so far. "There seems to be some sort of decoupling going on," said Desmond Lachman, director of emerging-markets economic research at Salomon Smith Barney.
"The stabilized environment has allowed us to look at stocks in the region on a bottom-up basis," Mr. Espinosa said. This is a stock-by- stock approach that is still cautious, looking for undervalued stocks but precluding any big immediate moves. And he is still uncomfortable in Brazil.
Before the Asian financial crisis and the subsequent Russian financial crisis sent emerging markets reeling, money managers thought of these markets as a group or, in investment jargon, an asset class. At that time, getting into emerging markets was buying the asset class. The choice was being in emerging markets, not being in a particular stock. Money moved faster that way.
And at that time the emerging- market asset class was thought to be good for the diversification of a portfolio. Emerging markets could be generally counted on to be contrarian, so they would go up when other markets were falling.
But now, Mr. Espinosa said, emerging markets seem to be following the rest of the world's markets, especially when they decline. And that means there is no diversification benefit in emerging markets, which had helped offset the higher risk of being in them. "We have not got the diversification benefit we expected," he said.
What would be ideal, Mr. Espinosa added, would be to have stronger worldwide growth, which is always good for emerging stock markets, and a return to the benefits of diversifying into those markets.
But until then, he will be looking stock by stock, which means his return may be much slower than Mr. Pelosky would hope.

House Votes to Put Limits on Steel Imports
The House voted decisively to limit steel imports, ignoring opposition from the Republican leadership and an almost certain veto by the White House, which argues that the measure would violate world trade agreements.
The bill -- the first major trade measure of the new session of Congress -- directs the United States to limit annual steel imports from other nations to about 29 million tons of steel. It would be up to the Administration to decide whether to do so through quotas, tariffs or voluntary agreements. Page A1. 

Global Crossing to Buy Frontier
Global Crossing of Bermuda, a new international communications carrier, said it had agreed to acquire Frontier, which serves almost one million telephone customers in 13 states, for $10.8 billion in stock. Just three weeks ago, Global Crossing hired as its chief executive Robert Annunziata, who had run AT&T's business services unit after selling his previous company, Teleport Communications Group, to AT&T for more than $11 billion.

HEADLINE: The Big City;
Call to Resist Easy Promises Of Milk Cartel

BYLINE: By JOHN TIERNEY 

 BODY:
IT'S not surprising that dairy farmers would like New Yorkers to pay more for milk, or that politicians want to oblige the farmers. But why are environmental groups supporting this cause when it may end up harming the environment even more than consumers?
New York farmers want to join the Northeast Interstate Dairy Compact, a New England group that sets milk prices. Urban politicians and consumer groups have opposed the cartel, arguing that the burden of higher milk prices -- perhaps 15 cents a gallon on average -- would fall most heavily on poor families with children. But the farmers recently prevailed in the State Legislature, and are now seeking final approval from Congress. 
 The cartel has been championed by Gov. George E. Pataki and other upstate Republicans, who have set aside their own professed belief in the free market. The cartel is also being supported by some Democrats, including Senator Charles E. Schumer, and an array of environmental groups like the Adirondack Council, the National Audubon Society, the Natural Resources Defense Council and the Sierra Club.
"Dairy farms provide cultural and natural landscape preservation," said David Miller, the executive director of the New York State office of the National Audubon Society. "We want to protect them against suburban sprawl and preserve habitat for birds and other species."
It's true that New York has been losing dairyland -- about five million acres since 1960, according to Nelson Bills, an agricultural economist at Cornell University. But most of the abandoned pastures have reverted to brushland and forest, which environmentalists can hardly consider less "natural" than farmland.
"Environmentalists in the cities don't have very clear thinking on this issue," said William Parment, a Democratic Assemblyman and former dairy farmer from rural Chautauqua County who has opposed the dairy cartel. "It's difficult to believe if you're looking around the George Washington Bridge, but the largest change in land use this century in New York State has been from farm field to forests."
What about the minority of dairy farms near cities that might be converted to malls and subdivisions? If the citizens of those communities deem it vital to preserve those farms, they could use general tax revenues to buy development rights from farmers, especially the small farmers that environmentalists want to keep in business. That approach seems more equitable and direct than raising milk prices, which essentially forces consumers to pay a regressive tax that goes mostly to the owners of large farms.
AND the higher prices may well mean less farmland, because consumers would respond by buying less milk. If New Yorkers' milk consumption declined by 1 percent to 2 percent, as economists have projected, the resulting milk glut would render superfluous perhaps 10,000 acres now used by dairy farmers.
In the long run, the dairy policies advocated by environmentalists could even contribute indirectly to the destruction of tropical forests, according to Dennis T. Avery, the director of global food issues for the Hudson Institute, a conservative public policy group in Indianapolis.
"The more that the states and the Federal Government intervene in agriculture," Mr. Avery said, "the more difficult it becomes for the United States to demand that other countries open their markets to our farm products. That's bad news for tropical wildlife. If there were free trade, the countries that are now cutting down tropical forests to create low-quality farmland would instead be buying grain and dairy products from America."
Environmentalists often disdain America's factory farms in favor of the agriculture practiced by traditionalists in the Adirondacks and peasants in the tropics, but those farmers need much more land to grow food. Mr. Avery calculates that the increased efficiency of modern farming has saved an area of land equal to the combined size of Europe, the United States and South America.
"Old MacDonald's farm couldn't feed the planet's population without destroying virtually every square mile of wildlife habitat," Mr. Avery said. "Environmentalists and dairy farmers ought to be increasing trade instead of creating cartels. Rather than raising the price of milk for children, New York farmers should be exporting the milk so India doesn't dispossess the Bengal tiger."

HEADLINE: Japan's Trade Surplus Fell 35.4% in February

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Thursday, March 18

 BODY:
Japan's merchandise trade surplus fell 35.4 percent in February from January as exports declined while imports rose.
The trade surplus fell to a seasonally adjusted 855.2 billion yen, or $7.2 billion, the Ministry of Finance said. Economists polled by Bloomberg News had forecast a 22 percent decline. Compared with the corresponding month last year, the surplus dropped 26.9 percent, to 934.2 billion yen, only the second decline in 23 months. 
 Japan's trade surplus shrank in February from a year earlier as exports to Asia, the United States and Europe all fell. Strong exports to the United States and Europe last year cushioned the impact of plummeting shipments to Asia. Yet slower export growth to Europe and a gradual increase in imports as domestic production picks up should restrain growth in the surplus this year.
"The surplus is probably still slowly heading up but at a much more moderate rate of increase than we saw through last year," said Richard Jerram, head economist at ING Barings Securities Japan, before the figures were released.
The strong yen late last year will likely take a toll on Japanese exports in the second half of 1999, Mr. Jerram said. The dollar plunged 26 percent from Aug. 11 to a low of 108.89 yen on Jan. 11. Currency movements take about a year to affect trade flows, economists say. The dollar was today quoted at 118.18 yen.
In February, exports fell 12.3 percent -- the fifth consecutive monthly drop -- led by declining shipments of steel, semiconductors and cars. By volume, Japanese exports fell 7.4 percent, declining for the 10th consecutive month.
Imports fell 5.7 percent from February last year, in spite of a rise of 1.8 percent in shipments to Asia, the first increase in 14 months. Japanese companies imported more office machinery from Asia.

HEADLINE: Saving a Regional Icon

 BODY:
The Federal Government's decision on Tuesday to order new protections for nine threatened salmon populations in the Pacific Northwest is just the beginning of what could be the biggest and most expensive rescue effort in the 26-year history of the Endangered Species Act. It is an effort worth making. The decline of the once-great salmon runs of the Pacific Northwest ranks high among the ecological blunders committed in the name of economic growth. The time has surely come to correct that mistake.
What makes the challenge uniquely interesting is its reach. Salmon spawn throughout the Pacific Northwest, so any effort to save them will have to be regional in scope. The effort will inevitably require higher taxes to clean hundreds of waterways and buy open space in crucial watersheds. It will impose tough restrictions on new construction, farming and logging, and may even require the costly decommissioning of Federal and private dams that impede salmon runs but have also long supplied the Pacific Northwest with cheap power. 
 The early response from local politicians and citizens has been extraordinarily positive. One reason is that the salmon is not only economically important to the Pacific Northwest but is virtually a cultural icon. Beyond that, many local residents are consumed by fears that development will someday destroy the natural beauty that surrounds them. A save-the-salmon effort, with all the restrictions that implies, is thus seen as a timely antidote to shapeless sprawl. As Seattle's Mayor, Paul Schell, noted, "as we work to save the salmon, it may turn out that the salmon save us."
But this battle has a very long way to go. It is one thing to preach salvation. It is quite another to pay the price when the controls kick in -- when farmers have to stop using pesticides, when developers have to stop building in sensitive watersheds, when loggers have to stop cutting trees along salmon-bearing streams. Today's euphoria could easily become tomorrow's backlash.
There are also many questions surrounding the Federal commitment. Washington moved to protect the salmon only because environmental advocacy groups threatened to sue if it did not -- an exact replay of the campaign to save the spotted owl. By listing the salmon as threatened, the Clinton Administration has now saddled itself with an even more onerous responsibility -- insuring that Washington and Oregon develop an effective plan to save the fish. Vice President Gore has promised a special appropriation of $100 million to underwrite a "cooperative restoration effort." But if the states falter, Washington would be obliged under the Endangered Species Act to step in with a variety of legal and regulatory weapons that, in effect, could halt development in its tracks.
An early test of this commitment will come in the next few months when the Administration delivers its long-awaited proposal for restoring several species of salmon in the Snake River that were listed as endangered or threatened back in 1991 and 1992. Some scientists believe that these species will never recover unless the Federal Government dismantles or at least modifies eight dams on the Snake and Columbia Rivers -- a strategy unalterably opposed by many big consumers of electricity and by Washington's powerful Republican Senator, Slade Gorton.
The Administration may find other ways to restore the freshwater flows essential to the salmon's survival. But what matters here is the end result -- recovery. How the Administration responds will tell much about its long-term dedication to the other species listed this week.

HEADLINE: BY A WIDE MARGIN, THE HOUSE VOTES STEEL IMP ORT CURB

BYLINE: By ALISON MITCHELL 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 17

 BODY:
The House voted decisively today to limit steel imports, ignoring opposition from the Republican leadership and a White House warning that the measure would violate world trade agreements.
The 289-to-141 vote -- one short of the two-thirds margin needed to override a Presidential veto -- displayed the division in the Democratic Party over Mr. Clinton's free trade policies as well as the appeal of protectionism to Republicans from Rust Belt states. All but 13 House Democrats deserted the Administration. And 91 Republicans, a surprisingly large number, broke from their party's traditional free-trade position. 
 The bill, the first major trade measure of this session of Congress, directs the United States to limit steel imports from other nations to their average monthly volume for the three-year period ending in July 1997. It would be up to the Administration to decide whether to use quotas, tariffs or voluntary agreements to achieve such a reduction, which could approach 30 percent.
The day's debate and offstage lobbying showed the strange coalitions that have developed over trade policy as well as the growth in protectionist sentiment. When a measure to give the President broad power to negotiate trade deals -- the so-called fast-track authority -- was defeated last year, 71 Republicans voted against it. Today, 20 more Republicans took a stand against unfettered free trade.
With world demand hurt by the Asian financial crisis, foreign steelmakers have sold their products at low prices. The American industry has seen a drop in business while imports rose 33 percent in 1998 before starting to subside in December.
Last month, the Clinton Administration said it would impose tariffs to punish Japan and Brazil for dumping steel in this country at prices below cost and negotiated an agreement with Russia to limit imports.
The stricter limits passed by the House today are unlikely to become law. The bill's fate in the Senate is uncertain, and a Presidential veto is considered likely. In a letter to House members, the White House chief of staff, John Podesta, acknowledged the steel industry crisis but warned that the measure "constitutes a violation of our international obligations" under the World Trade Organization and "is not in our nation's economic interest." He said Mr. Clinton's senior advisers would recommend that he veto the bill.
This vote, though, showed how difficult it will be in this Congress to pass the long-sought measure to give the President the power to negotiate trade agreements and submit them to Congress for a vote without potentially crippling amendments.
Representative J. Dennis Hastert of Illinois, the House Speaker, also opposed the bill as a violation of free trade. But its supporters had enough backing probably to be able to force a vote, and Mr. Hastert let the measure come to the floor. His spokesman, John P. Feehery, said that some Republicans "were pushing very strongly for a debate, and we also wanted to avoid the other parliamentary shenanigans."
The Ways and Means Committee, which strongly favors free trade, reported the bill to the full House with the recommendation that it be defeated.
Pat Buchanan, the G.O.P. Presidential aspirant who has challenged the party's establishment, wrote to House Republicans on Tuesday urging them to support the bill to "regain the loyalty of working Americans."
And Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, the Democratic minority leader, spoke out in favor of the bill, giving a hint of the debate that might have been if he had chosen to challenge Vice President Al Gore for next year's Democratic Presidential nomination.
Unions are also working hard for the bill, and the United Steelworkers had several hundred rank-and-file members on hand for the final push. In the last few months, steelworkers have written to Congress and held rallies around the country. Industry and union representatives have complained to the Clinton Administration about the dumping of foreign steel.
"An economic collapse has swept the globe," Mr. Gephardt said, "first striking Asia, but now impacting Latin America and other developing countries as well."
During the debate over special aid from the International Monetary Fund to stabilize these economies, he continued: "I warned that import surges would result from the Asian economic crisis and that a plan needed to be in place to combat unfair imports. Unfortunately, no such plan was forthcoming."
Mr. Gephardt said 10,000 steel jobs had been lost to imports, adding that the United States "should not be forced to unilaterally take in a massive global import surge."
Several senior Republicans argued against the bill, which was sponsored by Representative Peter J. Visclosky, Democrat of Indiana. They contended that the American economy was thriving because of the new markets provided by international trade. They also said the limits proposed could hurt other United States manufacturers by raising steel prices and cutting off the supply of specialized steel products that were only available through imports.
Representative Bill Archer, Republican of Texas, the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, said that the President and his advisers had studied the steel situation and chose not to set quotas.
"The President's logic is clear," Mr. Archer said. "If the U.S. were to set up trade barriers now in our fragile world economy, we could have a much bigger problem on our hands that would affect thousands more American jobs and threaten our economy. In addition, we would set a terrible example for countries in real economic trouble -- countries whose leaders are under tremendous pressure to retaliate against American-made products."
But Rust Belt Republicans as well as Democrats took the side of the steelworkers and the industry. "We're going to stand up for Main Street today, not Wall Street," said Representative Bob Ney of Ohio. "That's why this bill is here. We're here because thousands of steelworkers and citizens would not let this issue go, would not let this issue die."
The limits in the House bill would reduce steel imports by 12 million tons a year from 1998 levels, while still allowing about 29 million tons of steel into the country. At the height of the import surge in 1998, 41 million tons of steel was being imported annually.
The Administration argued that the bill violated United States obligations to the World Trade Organization because it would impose a global limit on imports, instead of using existing tools such as tariffs to fight an illegal dumping of imports.
But confronted with the vote, Charlene Barshefsky, the United States trade representative, said, "While we oppose this legislation, we are going to work with the Congress to address this issue."
The Administration hopes eventually this session to muster support for an alternate approach to the steel crisis and to support a bill sponsored by Representative Sander M. Levin, Democrat of Michigan, and Representative Amo Houghton, Republican of New York. Their measure would change the trade law to make it easier and quicker for the Administration to take action in cases of import surges.

HEADLINE: House Panel Passes Blueprint For Tax Cuts and Spending

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 17

 BODY:
The House Budget Committee passed a Republican tax and spending blueprint tonight, sweeping aside objections from Democrats who said the plan promised too much in tax cuts and did too little to deal with the looming problems in Social Security and Medicare.
The party-line vote of 22 to 18 came after another day of partisan clashes over how the nation should take advantage of its improving fiscal outlook. The Senate Budget Committee also moved toward approval of the Republican plan, with a vote expected on Thursday. 
 The full House and Senate plan to take up the Republican budget next week. With approval likely in both chambers, Congress appears headed toward months of battles with the Clinton Administration encompassing both the annual tax and spending bills and efforts to shore up Social Security and Medicare.
The budget outline approved by the House Budget Committee tonight provides for a tax cut of at least $15 billion next year and nearly $800 billion over the next decade. It would increase spending for the military and education, but to remain with the tight spending limits imposed by the bipartisan 1997 balanced budget deal, it would scale back a broad array of other programs.
The plan would also require that all excess revenue generated by the Social Security payroll tax -- $1.8 billion over the next decade -- be set aside by Congress and used only for reducing the Federal debt or to pay for a change to the retirement system, such as the establishment of individual investment accounts.
Eager to establish their credentials for fiscal responsibility, Democrats have also pledged to stick to the spending limits, constraining their ability to attack Republicans as slashing domestic programs.
Instead, Democrats have been hammering at the Republican plan as failing to set aside for Medicare any specific amount of money out of the projected non-Social Security surplus of almost $800 billion over the next 10 years. The budget proposed last month by President Clinton set aside $350 billion over that period to help keep Medicare, the health insurance system for the elderly, from going broke as the population ages.
The Administration also opened an attack today on the Republican proposal to lock away the Social Security surpluses by writing into law a gradual reduction in the amount of public debt the Government could have outstanding.
In a letter to Democratic leaders in Congress, Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin said the Republican "lockbox" plan could leave the Treasury unable to refinance debt or issue new debt in an unexpected economic downturn. As a result, Mr. Rubin said, he would recommend that Mr. Clinton veto the bill.
In both the House and Senate committees, Democrats offered proposals that would have blocked or reduced the Republican tax cuts, but were thwarted on party-line votes.
The budget resolutions making their way through the two chambers will not become law and are not subject to a veto. But they set the priorities for the tax-writing and appropriations committees as they develop legislation over the rest of the year, and they amount to a detailed agenda for the Republican-controlled Congress.
The biggest hurdle facing the Republican plan may come not from the White House, but from the difficulty Congress will have in voting to cut dozens of popular programs at a time when the economy is strong and projections of future surpluses continue to grow.
Even Republicans on the appropriations committees are skeptical that they can pass bills enacting deep spending cuts. Both parties are hopeful that projections of next year's surplus will be increased in coming months, and in both parties there is a growing sense that the most likely way out of the problem is a deal late in the year that would split any fiscal windfall between spending and bigger tax cuts.
For today, though, Republicans were eager to proclaim that their budget delivered on all counts: saving Social Security and Medicare, maintaining fiscal discipline but spending more where the money is needed most.

HEADLINE: Politically and Technically Complex, Medicare Defies a Sweeping Redesign

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 17

 BODY:
Ira C. Magaziner, the politically tone-deaf architect of President Clinton's ill-fated health plan, and Senator John B. Breaux, the deal-making chairman of a commission that failed to find a solution to Medicare's financial woes, share what might be called the hubris of health care reformers: the belief that they could devise an all-encompassing scheme to redesign a huge swath of America's health care system.
Both failed spectacularly. Their efforts suggest that piecemeal, incremental changes are the only ones feasible at the moment, given the political and technical complexity of the subject. 
 The 17-member Medicare commission expired on Tuesday, one vote short of the 11 needed to endorse any formal recommendations to Congress or the President. Mr. Breaux, a Louisiana Democrat, said he would continue his effort to inject free-market competition into Medicare, and even a harsh critic of the plan, Senator John D. Rockefeller 4th of West Virginia, said today that some version of it might eventually "land on the President's desk."
Mr. Breaux's proposal for Medicare and Mr. Magaziner's plan for the entire health care system were both built on the idea of "managed competition": the Government would set rules for private health plans to compete, in the hope that they would offer more benefits and higher-quality care at lower prices. Health maintenance organizations would compete against traditional health insurance plans, which pay a fixed fee for each service.
Mr. Breaux and Mr. Magaziner would both have offered new benefits, including drug coverage, while creating strong incentives for subscribers to choose lower-cost plans.
The failure of these efforts suggests again the difficulty, maybe even the futility, of comprehensive proposals to overhaul the way health care is financed and delivered.
But the complexity of health care and the rapid pace of medical discoveries also make it difficult for Government to regulate this market.
"It is absolutely impossible to micro-manage health care in the 21st century" as Congress has required, Mr. Breaux said, noting Medicare's convoluted formulas to pay doctors, hospitals, nursing homes, H.M.O.'s and home health care agencies. The promise of simplicity is one reason for the appeal of the plan that Mr. Breaux drafted with help from Representative Bill Thomas of California, the panel's leading Republican.
"There are at least 10,000 Medicare reimbursement codes for hospital and physician services, and there are more than 3,000 counties in the United States," said Len M. Nichols, a health care economist at the Urban Institute. "It's very difficult for Medicare to get 10,000 prices right in 3,000 counties. It would be simpler for the Government to learn how to pay the right price for a package of services. The Breaux plan promised to move in that direction, but it didn't specify enough details to engender a consensus that we were ready to move now."
Supporters of the Breaux-Thomas plan say it will use the magic of the market to save money, encouraging greater efficiency among providers of health care.
But anyone who thinks Federal regulation would vanish under Mr. Breaux's plan is dreaming. Senator Breaux would create a powerful new Government agency, the Medicare Board. The board would negotiate with health plans, approve their benefits, determine the Federal payment to each plan and compute the premiums charged to beneficiaries.
For those who want to redesign Medicare, the thorniest issue is how to provide a new prescription drug benefit. Of the 39 million Medicare beneficiaries, more than 6 million are in H.M.O.'s, and most of these H.M.O.'s already offer drug benefits.
Democrats in Congress say drug coverage must also be available to people in the original fee-for-service Medicare program. But that makes drug companies nervous because it raises the possibility that Medicare would regulate drug prices. Judith H. Bello, executive vice president of the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, said she had not seen any proposal for drug coverage that relied adequately on the market.
Medicare costs are growing faster than revenues, and the gap will widen as baby boomers become eligible for Medicare after 2010. But Congress usually responds only to pressing problems, and Medicare's financial troubles seem less urgent today than in 1997, when Congress created the Medicare commission.
Medicare spending rose last year just 1.5 percent, the smallest increase since the beginning of the program in 1965. Nancy-Ann Min DeParle, the head of the Medicare program, said this was "probably an aberration," reflecting a decline in the use of home health care and a reduction in fraud and abuse.
President Clinton, Senator Breaux and many Republicans are talking about comprehensive changes in the structure of Medicare. But Congress will have its hands full fixing the law it passed in 1997. That law was intended to create new health insurance options for the elderly and to entice more H.M.O.'s into the Medicare market, under a new program known as Medicare+Choice.
Many H.M.O.'s unexpectedly pulled out of Medicare or reduced their service areas, causing confusion and alarm for more than 440,000 beneficiaries.
In announcing that he would offer his own proposal to revamp Medicare, Mr. Clinton said: "We must find agreement this year. Medicare is too important to let partisan politics stand in the way of vital progress."
The outlook for action is unclear, but one thing is certain. Politics will pervade the debate. It could be no other way in a program that spends more than $200 billion a year to care for 39 million people.

HEADLINE: Our China Policy Is Based on Wishful Thinking

 BODY:

To the Editor:
The problem with the Clinton Administration's China policy isn't that it's "running on automatic pilot" toward engagement (editorial, March 14), but that it's based on wishful thinking characterized by triangulation and crisis response. 
 While the goal remains largely unchanged from President Richard M. Nixon's when the United States first opened serious relations with China, this Administration talks a lot about constructive engagement but delivers little. Legions of dedicated public servants burn the midnight oil trying to deal with the consequences of optimistic political and economic positioning. Los Alamos is simply the most recent example.
The story resonates because all Americans can easily grasp the contradictions that the Administration refuses to acknowledge.
Technology transfer and theft of American nuclear secrets aren't the real problem; the wishful thinking that drives the Administration's actions is.

HEADLINE: G.O.P. Still Places Environment Last

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Gov. Tom Ridge's call for a Republican model of environmental stewardship (Op-Ed, March 15) compares the Federal Superfund program, which has cleaned only 13 of the 111 Superfund sites in Pennsylvania, unfavorably with the state's land recycling program, which has put 350 polluted sites back to use in four years. 
 There are two important differences between these programs. Superfund sites are highly contaminated and pose an immediate threat to human and environmental health; brownfield sites -- industrial sites with suspected contamination -- do not. Superfund requires permanent remedies; state brownfield programs provide for use-based remedies that permit contamination to remain.
The new G.O.P. identity the Governor proposes looks a lot like the old G.O.P. identity that values the economy over health and environmental protection.

 BODY:

Pleasantville
Attached to the placid 50's scene he sees on reruns of his favorite 50's show, a high school student named David (Tobey Maguire, left, with Marley Shelton) and his unwilling, very 90's sister, Jennifer (Reese Witherspoon), get sucked into that world through their television set. Inside the tube, Dad (William H. Macy) yells the inevitable "Honey, I'm home," and Mom (Joan Allen) obligingly has those artery-clogging meals on the table at 6 sharp. Chafing at the sterility, the liberated Jennifer shakes up the young set, and even David sees the need to introduce change and passion. Pleasantvillers either go along or resist, but by then, Janet Maslin wrote in The New York Times, an ingenious fantasy has "seriously belabored its once-gentle metaphor and light comic spirit." 
1998. New Line. $107.37. 123 minutes. Closed captioned. PG-13. Release date: March 23.
 
Mighty Joe Young
After his mother is shot by hunters who want to pack him off to a zoo, a baby gorilla called Joe escapes and grows tall in the bush. That's 15 feet tall, a good height for theme park planners. Cared for by a leggy blond naturalist named Jill (Charlize Theron), Joe eventually gets flown to Los Angeles after a well-meaning zoologist (Bill Paxton) convinces Jill that the gorilla would be better off in a specially prepared natural habitat (or as natural as it gets in Los Angeles). Joe, however, gets upset and goes on a mild rampage in a film that "is essentially 'King Kong' for kids. Very young kids" (Stephen Holden).
1998. Disney. $24.99. 114 minutes. Closed captioned. PG. Release date: March 23.
 
The Best Man
To help her bourgeois father with his money problems, the beautiful Francesca (Ines Sastre) agrees to marry a sleazy, affluent older businessman (Dario Cantarelli) who can brighten the financial situation. The year being 1899 and the place a small northern Italian town, the situation necessarily puts restraints on the young woman, who tries to leverage herself out of her intolerable predicament by attaching herself to the best man (Diego Abatantuono). As it examines the bartering of ripe flesh for property, Pupi Avati's film makes a "fascinating, microscopically detailed study" (Holden).
1998. Universal. $99.36. 101 minutes. Italian with English subtitles. PG. Release date: March 23.
 
Living Out Loud
Freshly divorced and desperately needing direction, Judith (Holly Hunter) pours her heart out to everyone she meets. Soon she is taken under the wing of a cabaret singer (Queen Latifah) who helps change her life and a kindly doorman (Danny DeVito) who turns out to be a kindred spirit. Richard LaGravenese's film gets too ardently introspective at times, but Ms. Hunter imparts "intelligence, thwarted passion and obvious depth of feeling" (Maslin).
1998. New Line. $105.77. 93 minutes. Closed captioned. R.
 
Straight to Video
 
Other new titles of interest, some of which may have had a theater release at one time, appeared on television or been issued on videocassette in earlier editions.
 
BROTHER. The setting is 1990's St. Petersburg, but the feel is 30's gangster movie. Intent on getting his little piece of the pie, a young hoodlum freshly discharged from the Russian Army joins his brother, a contract killer, and plunges into intimidation and murder in a city torn by gang warfare and rampant crime. In Aleksei Balabanov's film, the mood is stark and the effect "terrifically stylish," Stephen Holden wrote in The New York Times. 1997. $79.95. 96 minutes. Russian with English subtitles. No rating.
 
COMING HOME. In a mini-series drawn from a novel by the British romance writer Rosamunde Pilcher, a young girl comes of age in England before and after World War II. Emily Mortimer, Katie Ryder-Richardson, Peter O'Toole and Joanna Lumley star. 1999. Four cassettes. $59.95. 205 minutes. Information: (800) 999-0212.
 
CARLA'S SONG. Ken Loach's film follows an unemployed Scottish bus driver who gets a lesson in C.I.A.-sponsored treachery and atrocities when he accompanies his suicidal girlfriend to her native Nicaragua during the fighting between the contras and the Sandinistas. 1998. Fox Lorber $89.95. 127 minutes. No rating.
 
PAUL MONETTE: THE BRINK OF SUMMER'S END. In Monte Bramer's documentary, the gay activist and author of "Borrowed Time: An AIDS Memoir" and "Becoming a Man: Half a Life Story" movingly lives out his days (he died of AIDS four years ago). 1998. $39.95. 90 minutes.

HEADLINE: MOVIE GUIDE

 BODY:

Here is a selective listing by critics of The Times of new or noteworthy movies and film series playing this weekend in New York City. * denotes a highly recommended film or series. Ratings and running times are in parentheses. An index of reviews of films opening today appears on page 9.
 
Now Playing
 
* "AFFLICTION," starring Nick Nolte, James Coburn, Willem Dafoe, Sissy Spacek and Mary Beth Hurt. Directed by Paul Schrader (R, 114 minutes). Mr. Nolte is devastating in the performance of his career, as Wade Whitehouse, a New Hampshire loner fighting a losing battle with demons from his past. Foremost among them: Mr. Coburn, terrifyingly authentic as the drunken, abusive father who long ago cowed his sons into submission. As directed by Mr. Schrader, this pure, unfettered adaptation of Russell Banks's novel starts on a deceptively ordinary note, then escalates into inexorable fury. Every little detail matters. Ms. Spacek and Ms. Hurt expertly play the women who trigger Wade's crisis (Janet Maslin). 

* "ANALYZE THIS," starring Robert De Niro and Billy Crystal. Directed by Harold Ramis (R, 110 minutes). The title, concept and teaming of these co-stars are all funny before the lights go down, so think of this comedy as an offer you can't refuse. Cast as a mobster whose confidence is shaken, Mr. De Niro is hilarious simply by playing his role halfway straight, in classic goodfella style. His mobster finds just the right comic foil in Billy Crystal, as the psychiatrist who utters the immortal: "When I got into family therapy, this wasn't the family I had in mind." There's a lot more where that came from in this breezy comic treat (Maslin).
 
"BABY GENIUSES," starring Kathleen Turner and many toddlers. Directed by Bob Clark (PG, 94 minutes). One way to get through this guaranteed 100 percent laugh-free comedy is to wonder whether it really is the worst film you've even seen. Probably not, but it's pretty darn close. Woefully substandard production values give it a ghastly look, made all the worse by the grotesque computer morphing of young children into adult-style wise guys. The plotting is shrill, bordering on incomprehensible. Ms. Turner lurches through the film with a performance that just says, "Hey, it's a living" (Maslin).
 
* "CENTRAL STATION," starring Fernanda Montenegro. Directed by Walter Salles (R, 115 minutes). In this quiet, luminous Brazilian gem, a joyless older woman crosses paths with an orphaned boy. There's plenty of room for sentimentality here, but the wonder of Mr. Salles's film is all in the telling. As these characters develop a fractious bond, then embark on a road trip that takes them vividly to Brazil's hinterlands in search of the boy's father, Mr. Salles brings great tenderness and surprise to the events that punctuate their journey. Ms. Montenegro's tough bravura performance was one of last year's very best (Maslin).
 
"THE CORRUPTOR," starring Chow Yun-Fat and Mark Wahlberg. Directed by James Foley (R, 111 minutes). A conventional but above-average police drama set in Chinatown in New York City, "The Corruptor" finds the rookie cop Danny Wallace (Mr. Wahlberg) learning the ropes from his rule-bending partner, Nick Chen (Mr. Chow), who has gotten dangerously chummy with Chinatown's mob bosses. The atmosphere is gritty, the action sequences sleek and the questions the story raises about loyalty, ethics, friendship and betrayal, although familiar, are still worth bringing up. "The Corruptor" is a more effective showcase for the brooding charisma of Mr. Chow, a Hong Kong action superstar, than "The Replacement Killers," his English-language debut (Stephen Holden).
 
* "THE DEEP END OF THE OCEAN," starring Michelle Pfeiffer, Treat Williams and Whoopi Goldberg. Directed by Ulu Grosbard (PG-13, 108 minutes). Ms. Pfeiffer gives a fine, affecting performance in this adaptation of Jacquelyn Mitchard's best seller. And Mr. Grosbard carefully delineates its story of a child's disappearance and its aftermath, showing the ways that such a catastrophe affects his family. Restrained and unsentimental, this astute drama deals thoughtfully with the chasm between real and idealized family lives (Maslin).
 
"EIGHT MILLIMETER," starring Nicolas Cage and Joaquin Phoenix. Directed by Joel Schumacher (R, 120 minutes). This thriller delves into the perverse underworld of the pornography business, shocking audiences with the realization that sex and violence can be so dull. Mr. Cage, seriously miscast, plays a private detective and devoted family man who is suddenly, to his horror, drawn into the realm of porn. Naturally, this is where the film wanted to be even when its opening scenes were stuck in suburban Pennsylvania. But the story's parade of New York and Hollywood sleazeballs fails to deliver either engaging drama or heartfelt kinks. Mr. Phoenix is scene-stealingly good in a sidekick's role (Maslin).
 
* "LIFE IS BEAUTIFUL," directed by and starring Roberto Benigni (PG-13, 122 minutes). Italy's most antic funnyman dares to find humor and tenderness in the midst of the Holocaust, and his risk pays off. This Cannes prize winner is as stubbornly entertaining as its central character, a Jewish waiter named Guido who jokes his way through the nightmare for the sake of his loved ones. Daring also to combine an opening hour of romance and pranks with a more somber second act, Mr. Benigni avoids all traces of the maudlin and effectively creates a situation in which comedy is courage. In this unpretentious, enormously likable film, he shines as a father whose fibs and hilarious buffoonery know no bounds, and no fear (Maslin).
 
* "LOCK, STOCK AND TWO SMOKING BARRELS," starring Jason Flemyng, Dexter Fletcher, Vinnie Jones and Nick Moran. Directed by Guy Ritchie (R, 106 minutes). Not since "The Usual Suspects" has there been such an oversupply of cool macho schemers in a single film. And they're served up with a quick, tart economy that bespeaks the filmmaker's background making videos and commercials -- actually an advantage, for a change. There's not much beneath the surface here; what's most entertaining is Mr. Ritchie's droll, hard-boiled storytelling and the rogue's gallery of a cast that he has assembled. All the film need do is juggle assorted miscreants and four separate gangs who, figuratively speaking, can't shoot straight (Maslin).
 
"MESSAGE IN A BOTTLE," starring Kevin Costner, Robin Wright Penn and Paul Newman. Directed by Luis Mandoki (PG-13, 110 minutes). Nicholas Sparks's best-selling novel, about a lonely, sensitive man who sends a message out to sea and the lonely, beautiful woman who finds it, is now a long and soggy film. Kevin Costner crosses the line from teasingly laconic to stodgy and seems as likely to have written "Bleak House" as the love letter in question. Robin Wright Penn makes an appealing heroine, but there's not much room for real emotion in a film with the tenor of a commercial for hazelnut-flavored coffee. As the hero's crusty old father, Mr. Newman steals what's left of the show (Maslin).
 
"OCTOBER SKY," starring Jake Gyllenhaal and Chris Cooper. Directed by Joe Johnston (PG, 100 minutes). By far the most moving scenes here are home movie snippets, circa 1957, that show the real people on whom the film's characters are based. Otherwise, despite being closely based on a best-selling memoir ("Rocket Boys") by the NASA engineer Homer H. Hickam Jr., this earnest, nostalgic film has a way of seeming too good to be true. The film's simplicity is appealing, as is Mr. Gyllenhaal in the central role of a boy in a West Virginia coal mining town who becomes obsessed with rocketry. But the story, filled with father-son conflict and down-in-the-ground versus up-in-the-sky contrasts, often follows a familiar trajectory (Maslin).
 
"PAYBACK," starring Mel Gibson and Gregg Henry. Directed by Brian Helgeland (R, 110 minutes). In this inept, excessively sadistic film-noir spoof adapted from the same Richard Stark novel ("The Hunter") that inspired the 1967 genre classic "Point Blank," Mr. Gibson is a thief named Porter who retaliates with a vengeance after an attempt on his life. Determined to recover $70,000 that was stolen from him by a double-crossing partner in crime, he works his way up the pecking order of a crime syndicate, brutally dispatching all who stand in his way. The hard-boiled dialogue is ludicrous, the storytelling clunky, the acting fair to awful, the gore ankle deep. Credit the star with being able to keep a straight face through this loathsome mess (Holden).
 
* "SAVING PRIVATE RYAN," starring Tom Hanks, Matt Damon, Tom Sizemore, Jeremy Davies and Edward Burns. Directed by Steven Spielberg (R, 168 minutes). Mr. Spielberg's soberly magnificent new film is the finest war movie of our time. Turning back the clock to restore passion and meaning to the genre, he works in a spirit of urgent communication to look at war as if it has not been looked at before. Tour-de-force battle scenes are frank without sensationalism, and the same great storyteller who made you believe there was an extraterrestrial hiding in the closet has made this an irresistibly vibrant, gripping tale. Mr. Hanks continues to astonish with admirable modesty, and the rest of the casting is comparably inspired. As he did with "Schindler's List," Mr. Spielberg has made a landmark film of devastating power (Maslin).
 
* "SHAKESPEARE IN LOVE," starring Joseph Fiennes, Gwyneth Paltrow and Geoffrey Rush. Directed by John Madden (R, 113 minutes). A witty, sexy and merrily literate delight, with an exhilaratingly clever premise that only gets better as the film unfolds. The screenplay, originating as Marc Norman's brainstorm and turned by Tom Stoppard into razor-sharp dialogue reminiscent of his "Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead," dares to imagine whatever it likes about the link between Shakespeare's artistic passions and his mad yearning for a certain aristocratic beauty. Meanwhile this tirelessly inventive comedy envisions an Elizabethan theater fraught with the same backbiting and conniving we enjoy today and has great fun presenting the creation of "Romeo and Juliet," glitches and all. Mr. Fiennes and Ms. Paltrow make a fine, tempestuous duo, and she gives the first great, fully realized starring performance of her career (Maslin).
 
* "TANGO," starring Miguel Angel Sola. Written and directed by Carlos Saura. Cinematography by Vittorio Storaro (PG-13, 100 minutes). A thrilling display of tango heat and virtuosity. And it's no slight to the actors who play lovers to say that the dancing here is steamier than any kiss. In his most electrifying dance film, Mr. Saura offers transfixingly beautiful glimpses of the dance and the great range of emotions it can conjure. Mr. Storaro's dazzlingly fluid cinematography captures all the nuances this material demands. Everyone in the film is utterly consumed by tango fever; audiences will be, too (Maslin).
 
"THE THIN RED LINE," starring Jim Caviezel, Ben Chaplin, Nick Nolte and Sean Penn. Directed by Terrence Malick (R, 166 minutes). From the first frame of this huge, drifting war epic loosely derived from James Jones's Guadalcanal novel, it's viscerally clear that Mr. Malick is back. The exquisite, oddly detached visual style that made "Badlands" and "Days of Heaven" the most beautiful films of the 1970's is instantly apparent here, even if the narrative vagueness and brooding voice-overs are also familiar. The film sprawls, gets lost and occasionally delivers visual poetry, the kind that could have been greatly helped by tighter editing. Bottom line: No one who admired Mr. Malick's early work should miss this. But those expecting anything simple will not find it here (Maslin).
 
"20 DATES," starring Myles Berkowitz. Directed by Mr. Berkowitz (R, 88 minutes). The filmmaker's gimmick is to make a film about dating. His goal: to go out with 20 different women, get them on camera by any means necessary and promise to fall in love with one before the experiment is over. Mr. Berkowitz, pesty and proud of it, has absorbed enough of Jerry Seinfeld and Garry Shandling to create a diffident, nit-picking, sitcom-ready persona. But whenever his film establishes a playful mood, it's liable to do something to make you squirm. Crassness and mock candor aren't all that funny (unless they're coming from Albert Brooks, whose "Real Life" paved the way for this). And discovering that cheese makes Mr. Berkowitz constipated or that one of his dates disappoints him by not looking enough like Jessica Rabbit is more than you need to know (Maslin).
 
"200 CIGARETTES," starring Paul Rudd, Kate Hudson and Courtney Love. Directed by Risa Bramon Garcia (R, 102 minutes). This contrived but cheery party movie is the feature directing debut of a well-known casting director. And in making her film, Ms. Garcia does what she does best: cast. A group of bright young players is brought together for a largely plotless New Year's Eve, rambling around a colorfully evoked East Village, circa 1981. Essentially just a set of interwoven skits, this comedy still makes good use of the actors noted above, along with Casey Affleck as a nice-guy punk, Dave Chappelle as a cabbie full of advice and Martha Plimpton as a hopeless hostess. Ms. Hudson, who is Goldie Hawn's daughter and has her mother's grin and giggle, makes an adorable debut despite spending part of the movie with dog excrement on her coat (Maslin).

HEADLINE: ON THE ROAD;
Sunny Stretch Around a Bay

BYLINE: By R. W. APPLE Jr. 

DATELINE: TAMPA, Fla.

 BODY:
Once upon a time, when there were more orange groves than golf courses in Florida, Tampa Bay was surrounded by a series of distinct communities: industrial, ethnically mixed Tampa, white-bread St. Petersburg and its retirees from the Midwest, laid-back Bradenton and Clearwater and, down the coast a bit, artsy, cosmopolitan Sarasota, where the circus spent the winter.
"We never went to St. Petersburg," says my colleague David Rosenbaum, who grew up in Tampa in the 1940's and 50's. "We had the port and the unions and Latins; they had the beaches and tourists and shuffleboard." 
 Now, in fact if not law, it's one big metropolitan area, laced together with bridges and freeways. People watch the same television stations and root for the same professional sports teams. Many of them send their children to the booming, multicampus University of South Florida. They shop at the same enormous malls, like the the brand-new Citrus Park Town Center, until recently a pasture, which drew upward of 100,000 cars on opening day.
On the road maps, this entity of 2.5 million people doesn't exist. Only the old place names are there. But everyone calls it Tampa Bay, and it is a prototypical example of the Sun Belt's explosive growth. Its subdivisions (mostly gated now) sprawl under postcard-blue skies. Its service-based economy thrives, and cultural and sporting diversions thrive with it.
Even baseball spring training, a seasonal ritual hereabouts for decades, is attracting new interest, thanks to last season's home run derby and the sprucing up of some of the ball parks where the big leaguers strut their stuff. No fewer than six teams train in the area, including the Yankees, whose main owner, George Steinbrenner, is a Tampa tycoon. They play their springtime games at the immodestly named Legends Field at 1 Steinbrenner Drive. Summertime, and the living is easy, the Gershwins wrote; if they had lived in Tampa Bay, they might have mentioned the other seasons, too.
Hernando de Soto, historians think, was Tampa Bay's first tourist, landing near modern Bradenton in 1539 and lingering only briefly before heading west on a fruitless search for jewels and gold that ended with his death on the banks of the Mississippi in 1542.
Not much happened for the three centuries after that, until Henry B. Plant built a railroad linking the bay to the rest of the country in 1883. In 1891 he added the astonishing 500-room Tampa Bay Hotel, built in an eccentric Moorish style, with keyhole-shaped windows and 13 silvery minarets topped with golden crescents. It had telephones in the rooms, electric lights, a private casino, two ballrooms, a billiard room and a peacock park, almost making good on Plant's pledge to "turn this sandheap into the Champs-Elysees."
Tampa was the staging point for the American forces dispatched to Cuba in the Spanish-American War, and in the summer of 1898 the Tampa Bay Hotel provided a broad veranda where Army and Navy officers and assorted hangers-on could sit in rocking chairs, sipping Champagne and iced tea, waiting for orders. Lieut. Col. Theodore Roosevelt was one of them, slipping away from his Rough Riders camped on the flats east of town, as the historian Edmund Morris tells the story, to spend three nights with his wife, Edith, in one of the hotel's grander suites.
 
Monument to an Era
One hot, sticky night Roosevelt and his handpicked men rode their horses into a local restaurant.
The expeditionary force sailed away in June, its commander having received his orders to embark while coffee was being served at the hotel one evening. The hotel never recaptured the glory of the Gay Nineties, closing in 1930. But it still stands as a monument to the man who built the Gulf Coast, used partly as a municipal museum and partly by the University of Tampa.
St. Petersburg flourished, once its railroad came, by luring white-collar refugees from the cruel winters and high taxes in Ohio, Michigan and Indiana. It is one of those cities, like Des Moines, that were shaped by newspaper editors with a determination to lead. They, too, came from the Midwest: W. L. Straub, who stopped the industrialization of the waterfront, preserving it for tourism, and his successor at The St. Petersburg Times, Nelson Poynter, who campaigned hard for good government and civil rights.
 
Waterfront Museums
Three art museums have opened along the waterfront in recent years, lending a new dimension to the city and contributing to a regional surge of cultural development. Oldest is the Museum of Fine Arts, whose 20 galleries house a small but comprehensive permanent collection. Its highlights, for me, include an aggressively scarlet "Poppy" by Georgia O'Keeffe; a subtle Lely portrait of Nell Gwyn, the actress mistress of Charles II; a shimmering Monet from the Parliament series, "Effect of Fog," and a supremely 1920's portrait of Mr. and Mrs. Chester Dale, benefactors of the National Gallery in Washington, by Guy Pene du Bois.
Down the street, improbably sited next to a pleasure-boat marina, is the world's largest collection of paintings and drawings by the flamboyant Catalan Surrealist, Salvador Dali. There are plenty of "melting" watches and a telephone shaped like a lobster, the kinds of things that made Dali's fame, but the four immense "masterworks" are the star attractions. The best of them, "The Discovery of America by Christopher Columbus," pays homage to the explorer, to Dali's idol, Velazquez, and to Dali's wife and muse, Gala.
The third of the trio, the Florida International Museum, housed in a former Maas Brothers department store, is not so much a museum as a 20,000-square-foot hall for hire. It has no collection of its own, relying instead on a succession of special shows: Romanov treasures, artifacts of the Incas and, soon, roomsful of personal effects and other objects associated with John F. Kennedy.
To get to the best museum in the region, perhaps the best in Florida, you have to take a drive. Happily, you go by way of the magnificent Sunshine Skyway Bridge across the mouth of Tampa Bay. Opened in 1987, patterned after the Brotonne Bridge across the Seine near Rouen, it is supported by a single, central set of cables rather than cables on both sides of the roadway. Many consider it the most impressive span built in this country since the Golden Gate Bridge in the 1930's.
It will take you, eventually, to Sarasota, and the John and Mable Ringling Museum of Art, a spectacular Italianate bayfront building with gleaming white rooftop statues. Inside the spectacle continues; Ringling was a circus man, with little taste for understatement. He sought to stun with art as he did under the Big Top, so he bought pictures by Baroque masters like Rubens and Pietro da Cortona at a time when their exuberance was out of fashion.
Today they anchor a collection of rare originality that ranges from Guercino to Titian to Piero di Cosimo's "Building of a Palace." The high point, perhaps, is the quartet of gigantic tapestry cartoons by Rubens, bought in 1926 from the Duke of Westminster and shown in a 40-foot-high gallery.
 
Performance Time
Sarasota is also a center for the performing arts. Every February and March its opera company stages four productions, and it does not confine itself to warhorses. This year's program includes "May Night," an early, little-known, folkloric piece by Rimsky-Korsakov, based on a Gogol story.
Astonishingly for a city of only 50,000 or so, Sarasota supports a 40-year-old Equity company at the Asolo Theater, adjacent to the Ringling museum. Its current eight-month season includes new plays by Jane Martin and Richard Greenberg, as well as four one-act comedies by Shaw and plays by Wilder, Sheridan, Odets, Sherwood, Joan Littlewood, Alfred Uhry and Steve Martin.
Each June Sarasota stages a well-regarded chamber music festival, and all year long the Van Wezel Performing Arts Hall, painted a jarring shade of purple, presents an almost nightly parade of visiting musicians. Recently the Boston Pops, the Berlin Radio Symphony under Rafael Fruhbeck de Burgos and the Moscow Philharmonic have paid calls, along with the Moiseyev Dance Company, the Guarneri String Quartet and Bernadette Peters. (Next month, it closes for several months of repairs.)
In fact the whole area is on a performing arts roll, with Ruth Eckerd Hall in Clearwater, the Mahaffey Theater in St. Petersburg and the huge Tampa Bay Performing Arts Center in Tampa full to overflowing with music and drama. On a single night not long ago the local music fan could choose among Gordon Lightfoot, Tony Bennett, the Rolling Stones and the Vienna Choir Boys.
And that is not even reckoning with the Florida Orchestra, which plays a seven-month season in several halls under the music directorship of Jahja Ling, who is also Christoph von Dohnanyi's No. 2 in Cleveland. The orchestra administers to the bay the prescribed monthly doses of Mozart, Mahler and Beethoven, but this year it has also programmed works by Hovhaness, Kodaly and William Schuman.
 
An Airport's Impact
In many ways bigger has proved to be better for Tampa Bay.
Start with the Tampa airport, which must be the best in the country. Opened in 1972 and currently undergoing modernization, it is more convenient in its state of upheaval than most airports at their most settled. The main terminal is linked to four remote buildings, housing the gates, by fast two-car automated trains that run above ground, up in the sunshine, not buried in some dingy tunnel. Bright, close in, with plenty of elevators and escalators and lots of easily understood signs, TPA ought to be cloned nationwide.
Along with the climate -- the sun is said to shine 361 days a year -- the airport has helped to attract all kinds of businesses, including the Home Shopping Network and back-office operations for big financial institutions, as well as biotechnology and other high-technology companies. ("High-tech in the mangroves," a local booster calls them.) It has also brought tourists, who head west to 50 miles of beaches along the Gulf of Mexico and east to Busch Gardens, the wildly popular offshoot of the local Budweiser brewery.
 
Animal Kingdoms
You can take your wild animals in Tampa with or without roller coasters. For the purist there is the fine Lowry Park Zoo, where you can see not only a Sumatran tiger but also a rare Florida panther and a rarer Indian rhinoceros. It also specializes in the rehabilitation of the manatee, an endangered species of huge, cowlike marine creatures. Only 2,500 remain in the wild.
Busch Gardens is bigger and brassier. It has four roller coasters, which flip and plunge and twist and climb until you think you've left your insides in another time zone, and bumper cars called Ubanga-Banga. (Geddit?) Its theme is Africa, more or less, but no one is too rigorous about it; you will see koalas from Australia and elephants from India and flamingos from Chile, too. The "Nairobi" train station looks just like South Africa, not Kenya, and the dolphin show inexplicably takes place in a mock-up of landlocked Timbuktu.
But I doubt that there is anywhere else on this continent with anything to rival the hundreds of antelopes and other animals that roam more or less freely on Busch Gardens' simulation of the Serengeti Plain. Many are rarities, seldom encountered in Africa: greater kudus and blesboks, elands and addaxes, sable antelopes and magnificent roan antelopes, bred at the park. Hokey the rides may be, but the young staff members care a lot about the animals; one of them, Erin Leach, spent 20 minutes establishing for me that a spectacularly colored bird that neither of us recognized was a saddle-billed stork.
A good sequel to either Busch Gardens or the zoo is the new Florida Aquarium in downtown Tampa, an $84 million, shell-shaped extravaganza in green glass whose tanks contain exhibits of aquatic life on Florida's coral reefs, in its oceanic depths and in its streams and mangrove swamps -- everything from menacing sharks to playful river otters to darting rainbow parrotfish.
 
Questions of Identity
Not everyone is crazy about Tampa Bay's coming of age, and St. Petersburg, in particular, worries about losing its identity. Politicians there, and taxpayers, too, complain that visiting out-of-towners too often assume they are in Tampa. They grumble about politicians and reporters who came for the Vice Presidential debate in 1996, and sportswriters who come to cover the new Tampa Bay Devil Rays baseball team at the slope-domed Tropicana Field in St. Petersburg, also the site of this year's college basketball Final Four.
Tampa has lost something, too, in the regional amalgamation.
"They are turning Tampa into the customary nothing," complained the mystery writer John D. MacDonald a quarter-century ago in one of his Travis McGee novels, "Bright Orange for the Shroud." "They've opened up the center of the city into a more spacious characterlessness, and more and more they are converting Ybor City into fake New Orleans."
As usual the gloriously grumpy MacDonald overstated the case. If the post-modern skyscrapers of downtown Tampa lack architectural distinction, it is much less sterile than many late-blooming cities, and the bankers, lawyers and deal makers have to work somewhere, don't they? As for Ybor City, where Hispanic tobacco workers and Italian immigrants once lived, it has indeed turned into an ersatz French Quarter, loaded with wrought-iron balconies and chockablock with bars; on Friday and Saturday nights, it belongs to the young and the rowdy.
 
Old-Time Flavor
Only faint hints remain of the days, long before a new generation of immigrants arrived from Castro's Cuba, when Ybor City was the cigar capital of the world. Along Seventh Avenue, you can still see the Columbia Restaurant, now frequented mainly by tourists, and the neoclassical Italian Club.
But Tampa has not lost all of its authentic Latin flavor. To sample that, visit La Teresita at 3248 West Columbus Drive, a landmark Cuban-American restaurant with green oilcloth on the tables, nestled amid shabby stores selling guava turnovers and Cuban sandwiches, not far from the airport. Go for Sunday lunch if you can, eat the Capdevila family's wonderful black beans and yellow rice, with vinegary roast pork on the side, and drink a cafe con leche. (I did; it cost $8.81 with tax and tip.) And be sure to look around. The clientele is young and old, rich and poor, Anglo as well as Latino: rednecks mingling with blue rinses, young girls in communion dresses with older ones wearing skimpy crop-tops.
Nor has St. Petersburg (named by a pioneer developer for his Russian hometown) lost all its old Midwestern blandness in the rush to tomorrow. It remains a low-key place, represented by politicians like C. W. Bill Young, the chairman of the powerful House Appropriations Committee, a conservative, of course, but not the kind who goes out of his way to punch you in the eye.
If you linger a while in the vicinity of Fourth Avenue North and Fifth Street, you will see institutions that cater to the city's still sizable geriatric population: the St. Petersburg Chess Club, the St. Petersburg Lawn Bowling Club, founded in 1926, and the proudly self-proclaimed "World's Largest Shuffleboard and Duplicate Bridge Club," on the shore of Mirror Lake.
 
What's on the List for a Visit to the Tampa Bay Area? Quite a Bit, With Arts and Animals Among the Highlights
 
Here is information about visiting the Tampa Bay area of Florida:
 
Where to Stay
 
DON CESAR BEACH RESORT, 3400 Gulf Boulevard, St. Pete Beach, (727) 360-1881. Discerningly restored a few years ago, this peachy-pink neo-Moorish palace, built in 1928, offers a fine beach, a spa, tennis courts, two pools and 232 handsome rooms. If Scott and Zelda stayed there, as everyone says, they knew the town as St. Petersburg Beach; local lawmakers, no poets, later clipped off two syllables in the interests of brevity. Double room rate: $289 to $329 weekdays; $319 to $359 on weekends.
 
HYATT REGENCY WESTSHORE, 6200 Courtney Campbell Causeway, Tampa, (813) 874-1234. Facing tranquil Tampa Bay, surrounded by flora and fountains, this crisply up-to-date, 14-story, 400-room hotel stands a head or two taller than the average Hyatt. It has three top-notch restaurants; Oystercatchers, named after a clever, bivalve-loving local bird, serves the region's best seafood. Double room rate: $225 weekdays; $149 on weekends through April, then $179.
 
LONGBOAT KEY CLUB, 301 Gulf of Mexico Drive, Longboat Key, (941) 383-8821. A resort, not really a club, on the strip of land across Sarasota Bay from Ringling-town, it emphasizes sports, with 45 championship golf holes and 38 tennis courts. The 213 trim rooms have kitchens and washer-dryers. Double room rate: $220 to $335; apartments from $270 to $735.
 
RENAISSANCE VINOY RESORT, 501 Fifth Avenue N.E., St. Petersburg, (727) 894-1000. On the bayfront in downtown St. Petersburg, the Vinoy is another reborn survivor from the 1920's. Pink as a flamingo on the outside, ornate on the inside, with stenciled pecky cypress beams in the lobby, it is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Its 360 luxurious rooms, plus pools, steam room, tennis courts and croquet lawn, attract an affluent clientele. Double room rate: $259; $139 starting in June.
 
WYNDHAM HARBOUR ISLAND, 725 South Harbour Island Boulevard, Tampa, (813) 229-5000. There's nothing too special about this modern establishment except the location, but that's very special indeed: on an artificial island, linked by bridge and monorail to skyscraper-studded downtown Tampa. The rooms are amply sized, and there's an on-site marina, if you're taking your sailboat. Double room rate: $149; $99 in April.
 
Where to Eat
 
BEACH BISTRO, 6600 Gulf Drive, Anna Maria Island, west of Bradenton, (941) 778-6444. Four good reasons to visit this out-of-the-way spot: 1. remarkable smoked salmon, which the Canadian proprietor imports weekly from J. Willy Krauch, an artisanal smoker in Tangier, Nova Scotia; 2. moist, perfectly cooked grouper, the local fish of choice; 3. a bountiful wine list, which includes Australia's prized Grange and five vintages of Chateau Pichon Longueville; 4. fabulous sunsets over the gulf. Only one quibble: Here as elsewhere in the area there is a regrettable tendency to litter plates with superfluous garnishes.
 
BOCA, 1930 East Seventh Avenue, Ybor City section of Tampa, (813) 241-2622. Boca's Nueva Latina dishes include shrimp ajillo (with garlic), exceptional flan and updated Cuban sandwiches (ham, roast pork and Swiss cheese on light Cuban bread). The surprise is the house salad, a tangy blend of field greens, manchego cheese, tomatoes and onions, dressed with a guava- and chili-flavored vinaigrette.
 
MISE EN PLACE, 442 West Kennedy Boulevard, Tampa, (813) 254-5373. Marty Blitz pioneered modern American cooking in the region, and his restaurant remains the local leader. A plate of tasty house-made charcuterie epitomizes the ambition and technical savvy of the kitchen. I was taken with a mustard-crusted rack of lamb, served on a hillock of Cheddar grits and moistened with a bourbon shallot demi-glace. The room is suave, the service less so.
 
TED PETERS SMOKED FISH, 1350 Pasadena Avenue South, St. Petersburg (727) 381-7931. This is the place, a local foodie told me, that he'd take Calvin Trillin to if he ever came to St. Petersburg. Since 1950, not long after the proprietor pulled into town from Olean, N.Y., this roadside shack has dished up definitive versions of local delicacies like smoked mackerel and gray mullet, as well as a tangy fish spread that tastes best on saltines.
 
REDWOOD, 247 Central Avenue, St. Petersburg, (727) 896-5118. Competent Pacific Rim cooking near the Atlantic rim, in a restored downtown storefront. I wish the menu featured more fish from the gulf and less marlin, albacore and yellowfin flown across the continent, but that didn't keep me from enjoying a nicely presented sashimi of rich ahi tuna coated with sesame seeds. The handsome copper bar is stocked with premium cognacs and single-batch bourbons.
 
SIDEBERN'S, 2208 West Morrison Avenue, Tampa, (813) 258-2233. For decades the only Tampa Bay restaurant with a national reputation was Bern's, known for an awesome wine list, good steaks and not much else. It carries on. But the sizzle has shifted to SideBern's, down the street, where Jeannie Pierola, a gifted young chef of eclectic bent, sets off fireworks nightly with westernized dim sum, like duck buns with vinegar syrup and crab-lobster dumplings with tamarind butter; Moroccan seared red snapper with harissa, and (homage to the older generation) a dynamic duo of short ribs and hanger steak. Selections from Bern's cellar insure that you won't leave thirsty.

HEADLINE: Mr. Spitzer's Inquiry

 BODY:
The police shooting last month of the West African immigrant Amadou Diallo is provoking ever-larger protests. Well-televised arrests at One Police Plaza trumpet the message that many New Yorkers believe the steep drop in crime has been accompanied by an increase in police harassment of minorities. Mayor Rudolph Giuliani says the demonstrations are being conducted "for a highly partisan political purpose." But it is also true that nonviolent sit-ins have become an established form of dissent when communities confront polarizing issues, and orderly protests can challenge elected officials to respond to civic concerns they might otherwise ignore. The fact that the American Jewish Committee has joined with black officials in questioning police conduct shows that worries about New York's policing practices cross racial lines.
In this context of community concern, the response of New York State's Attorney General, Eliot Spitzer, was appropriate. Mr. Spitzer announced a civil rights investigation into allegations that the police frisk many blacks and other minorities without justification. Mayor Giuliani, while angry at the demonstrators, correctly recognized Mr. Spitzer's right to conduct an inquiry. 
 The Attorney General said that during his campaign for the office last year he began hearing that New York City police were targeting nonwhites for improper searches. The complaints became more vocal and public after Feb. 4, when Mr. Diallo was killed in a fusillade of gunfire from four white police officers. A grand jury in the Bronx and Federal prosecutors are investigating the shooting. The Federal Civil Rights Commission has announced plans to hold hearings. What could distinguish the Spitzer investigation, however, is that it is focused narrowly enough to analyze police data quickly and make useful recommendations.
The Street Crimes Unit, whose officers were involved in the shooting, has been credited with lowering the murder rate by taking large numbers of illegal handguns off the street. Street Crimes police also stop many more people than they arrest, frisking 27,000 last year and arresting 4,600. The Attorney General will need to determine whether this unit has followed police guidelines, which allow frisking only if the officer "reasonably suspects" that a person could endanger police or others.
For Mr. Spitzer, who was elected last year by a slim margin, using the civil rights powers of his office to look at this crucial issue is a bold move. It would be easy for his political enemies to label this investigation as anti-police. But as Mr. Spitzer has said correctly, this inquiry, if done well, is "good for cops" because it can help rebuild the city's faith in the methods of its Police Department.

Treasuries Gain on Sign Inflation Still Is No Threat

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
Treasury bond prices rose for the second time in three sessions yesterday after a Government report pointed to tame inflation, even amid strong economic growth.
"Inflation is not going to be a problem," said Paul Van Kampen, who manages $1.3 billion of bonds at NCM Capital Management Group Inc. in Durham, N.C. Bonds hold more of their value when inflation is subdued. 
 The price of the 30-year Treasury rose 6/32 , to 96 19/32 . Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, fell to 5.48 percent, from 5.50 percent on Wednesday.
Consumer prices rose 1.6 percent in the 12 months ended in February. That puts 30-year yields at 3.89 percent after inflation is taken into account, near the highest since July and a level some investors find attractive.
Bond yields have fallen more than 20 basis points, or hundredths of a point, over the last two weeks as reports showing tame inflation and comments from Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, eased concern the central bank will raise interest rates soon.
That said, many investors said inflation was unlikely to go any lower.
"It's pretty clear that the economy is stronger than expected," said Kirk Hartman, who oversees $50 billion of bonds at Trade Street Investment Associates Inc. in Los Angeles. That will probably push inflation higher in the months ahead. "It's inevitable," he said.
Mr. Hartman said he favored securities like corporate bonds, which offer higher yields than Treasuries and benefit from periods of strong economic growth.
"You want to pick up excess return versus Treasuries," he said. With demand for corporate debt strong, companies including the AT&T Corporation, Federated Department Stores Inc. and Fannie Mae plan to sell at least $9.3 billion of bonds in coming days. That may limit gains in Treasuries, drawing demand away from Government debt, traders said.
Nomura Securities Inc. is also selling $2.4 billion of securities backed by commercial mortgages.
Yesterday, Peco Energy, Pennsylvania's largest utility, sold $4 billion of securities backed by a charge on customers' electric bills, the biggest such sale by a utility. The company said it plans to use proceeds in part to pay off some high-interest debt, which will result in lower electric rates.
In the largest expected sale, AT&T said it might sell more than $6 billion of bonds -- possibly topping the record $6.1 billion sold last year by MCI Worldcom Inc., the No. 2 long-distance company.

Jersey City Towers Broaden Lure of Living West of the Hudson

BYLINE: By RACHELLE GARBARINE 

 BODY:
A 12-acre site at the southeastern corner of the giant Newport mixed-use development in Jersey City will soon be filled by the third of four rental buildings in the Towers of America complex, which is to have 1,640 units.
With all space in the first two towers rented, construction on the third, the 33-story East Hampton, began in October. Tenants have placed $100 deposits on 20 percent of the 441 studio, one-bedroom and two-bedroom apartments even before the East Hampton's white stone and green-paneled exterior is complete, according to the developer, the Lefrak Organization of Rego Park, Queens. Monthly rents for the units, with 550 to 1,200 square feet, range from $950 to $2,490. 
 The occupancy date has been pushed up by five months to August "to keep up with the demand," said Richard S. LeFrak, president of the Lefrak Organization. Construction on the final tower, with 409 units, is to start in May.
The pace of construction at the $250 million complex reflects the second round of redevelopment along the west bank of the Hudson in New Jersey since the 1991-92 recession. The activity, which resumed in mid-1995, ending an eight-year slump in construction, has picked up momentum in the last 18 months. By year's end, about 1,550 rental units, many of them in Jersey City, are to be completed along the waterfront, where the vacancy rate is 3 percent, according to the ACI Group, a real estate services concern in Jersey City.
"The trend is strong and will continue as long as there is pressure on rents in Manhattan," said Carol M. Smith, director of marketing at Marketing Directors, a Manhattan-based consulting and marketing firm. Since the riverfront units are not coming onto the market at the same time, demand is ahead of supply, she added.
The demand is coming from a broader group of renters than the young professionals who came to the waterfront more than a decade ago, said Robert P. Antonicello, president of the ACI Group. Renters now include executive couples who work in Manhattan or in the office towers at the water's edge, as well as older couples from the suburbs and some families. There is also a steady, and some say increasing, number of people moving from New York City as rents there continue to rise.
A survey conducted by the Lefrak Organization showed that more than half of the residents of Towers of America, for example, came from New York City and that 85 percent of them worked in Manhattan. Many are professionals employed in financial services, law, communications and high-technology fields and they have average annual incomes of $127,000, the survey found.
Jon-Mark Odero, 23, who lives in midtown Manhattan and works as an analyst for a financial services concern in the financial district, put down a deposit for a fourth-floor studio at the East Hampton. "For the money I'm paying, Jersey is a better deal," he said, adding that the apartment is also larger and more conveniently located to his job.
Mr. LeFrak said the broadening demand for riverside housing was tied to the growth of the waterfront as a "viable community and an acceptable alternative to Manhattan." He said his company was "bullish about the market because the local job base continues to expand."
Indeed, his company is building a 567,318-square-foot office building, the third at Newport, and has leased about 300,000 square feet to Cigna and the U.S. Trust Company. Together, they are expected to bring 1,100 workers to the riverfront.
Robert Cotter, director of planning for Jersey City, said the growth of the waterfront had brought additional amenities, like restaurants, and would bring the city its first golf course, part of the Port Liberte condominium development, 1,290 units being developed by the Applied Companies of Hoboken, N.J.
Today's riverfront rental apartments are also larger than their earlier counterparts, Mr. Antonicello said, with two-bedroom units averaging 1,200 square feet. He added that developers were also including three-bedroom apartments for couples with children, tenants who want home offices or professionals who want to share an apartment. At the East Hampton, the Lefrak Organization will combine units to create larger ones.
Along with high-rise buildings, mid- and low-rise rental complexes have been or are being built along the Hudson in New Jersey. Among the first was Avalon Cove, with 504 units in twin five-story buildings that frame courtyards. It was developed by Avalon Bay Communities, which has built rental complexes in a number of New York suburbs in recent years. Other projects under way include the Landings at Port Imperial in West New York, with 276 units in four three-story buildings, which is being developed by Roseland Properties of Roseland. In Jersey City, Mr. Cotter said, plans are advancing for 324 rental units designed to resemble brownstones.
Some developers are also building condominiums. K. Hovnanian Enterprises of Red Bank, N.J., is developing 258 such units on 14 acres in West New York. More are planned, including 800 units the Lefrak Organization is to build, in phases, on a pier jutting out to the river after the fourth rental tower at Towers of America is completed next year, Mr. LeFrak said.
While rentals dominate the waterfront, turnover rates remain consistent, at less than 20 percent a year, and prices continue to increase, according to the ACI Group. The average rent is $25 per square foot per year, compared with $40 per square foot for comparable apartments in downtown Manhattan, Mr. Antonicello said.

HEADLINE: Consumer Prices Held Almost Steady in February

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 18

 BODY:
Consumer prices barely budged in February as reductions in apparel, automobile and fuel oil costs almost canceled out small increases in food and medical care expenses, the Labor Department reported today.
The Consumer Price Index, the Government's broadest measure of costs for goods and services, rose one-tenth of 1 percent last month, matching the increase in each of the previous two months. 
 With prices rising at an annual rate of only 1.6 percent, "there is no urgency for the Federal Reserve to tighten policy in the foreseeable future," said Kevin Flanagan, an economist at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter & Company in New York.
Separately, the Labor Department reported that first-time jobless claims increased by 6,000, to 298,000, in the week ended last Saturday, more than the 292,000 analysts had expected. Claims have stayed below 300,000 for seven weeks, the longest stretch since April 6-May 18, 1974.
The four-week average for claims -- a less volatile measure of employment conditions -- fell to 292,750 from 293,000.
The consumer price report showed that food prices, which account for almost a fifth of the index, rose one-tenth of 1 percent in February after increasing five-tenths of 1 percent in January. Energy prices, which account for almost a tenth, were unchanged as fuel oil prices dropped 1.4 percent while electricity prices rose six-tenths of 1 percent. Medical care costs rose two-tenths of 1 percent, led by a five-tenths of 1 percent increase in prescription drug costs.
Prices of personal computers fell 2.8 percent in February after dropping 4.4 percent in January. New and used auto prices fell seven-tenths of 1 percent, after declining four-tenths of 1 percent the month earlier. The cost of used cars and light trucks fell 1.5 percent on top of a 1.6 percent January decrease. Prices for new cars declined three-tenths of 1 percent in February.
Housing costs, which make up two-fifths of the index, increased one-tenth of 1 percent in February, led by an increase of two-tenths of 1 percent in shelter prices, which measure costs of mortgages and rent.

Unseen Risks For a Buyer Of Nissan

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE STROM 

DATELINE: TOKYO, March 18

 BODY:
DaimlerChrysler A.G. has been painting a grim picture of the Nissan Motor Company's balance sheet -- or rather, what is absent from it.
Since DaimlerChrysler stopped talking with Nissan last week about purchasing a stake in the heavily indebted Japanese auto maker, Renault of France has stepped forward with an offer. But investors seem more interested in why DaimlerChrysler walked away. 
 Publicly, it has been saying that it decided against taking a stake in Nissan in the interest of concentrating on the smooth integration of Daimler-Benz and the Chrysler Corporation, which combined their businesses only in November.
In private, however, DaimlerChrysler has been telling fund managers and analysts in Europe and the United States that even though it had 30 people examining Nissan's financial statements and operations for six months, it cannot say for certain that it firmly grasped the full extent of the company's potential liabilities.
DaimlerChrysler's disclosures have exposed Nissan to intense scrutiny and left many wondering whether Renault kicked the tires hard enough before making its offer on Tuesday. Renault's proposal to acquire 35 percent of Nissan, which the Japanese auto maker's board will review on Friday, could provide as much as $5.3 billion.
According to two fund managers and a fund-management analyst who have been briefed by Daimler, the more its team looked at Nissan, the more exposure there seemed to be.
"In having to defend itself, the news that's coming out of DaimlerChrysler about Nissan is not very positive," one of the fund managers said.
A person familiar with DaimlerChrysler's research suggested that Nissan's true liabilities -- not just debt but also such potential obligations as pension contributions and loan guarantees for affiliates -- were twice as great as the $21.2 billion that is publicly known.
The inconsistency in Renault's decision to bid and DaimlerChrysler's decision to withdraw has left investors skeptical, which is reflected in the depressed stock prices of Nissan and Renault. Credit-rating agencies have also expressed reservations, and financial news coverage has been muted on what would be a major foreign rescue of a leading Japanese corporation.
Instead, there is avid interest in matters like the steep erosion in Nissan's sales in Japan, the effect of the stronger yen on overseas sales, the higher-than-average interest rates Nissan is paying and the shortage in its pension fund. Some Japanese have long agonized over such things, but now these are gaining international attention.
There is little concern that Renault has the financial resources to pay for a Nissan stake -- the French company is debt-free, has ample lines of credit, and is 44 percent-owned by the French Government. Renault executives also insist they have an accurate reading on Nissan's business, including its debts.
According to a person close to the two companies' negotiations, Nissan had at first been willing to supply only limited, and opaque, information about its liabilities. But in recent weeks, it gave Renault executives answers that Renault considered satisfactory.
Although he did not offer a firm figure, this person conceded that Nissan's real indebtedness was certainly greater than the 2.5 trillion yen -- now $21.2 billion -- disclosed in the company's last annual report, reflecting the fiscal year that ended on March 31, 1998.
Nissan had an additional 1.8 trillion yen in liabilities related to its auto-leasing business for a total of 4.3 trillion yen in debt, although many analysts and auto-company executives do not regard leasing-related debt as a matter of concern.
But it is the auto maker's indebtedness outside what it is required to disclose that has concerned others, including DaimlerChrysler. Such so-called off-balance-sheet risks have long been rumored at Nissan and at other large Japanese companies, and Daimler is not the first potential buyer to have been scared away by them.
The Ford Motor Company is still smarting from the surprise it got when it increased its stake in the Mazda Motor Corporation to 33.4 percent in 1996, only to find out that Mazda's dealers had incurred enormous debts for which Mazda was liable, Ford executives have said.
Just last month, the Japanese Life Insurance Association abandoned its efforts to sell the Aoba Life Insurance Company after a big French concern, Pinault-Printemps-Redoute, cut its original bid in half. Previously, the American International Group, the insurer and financial-services company, was the leading suitor, but it walked away.
Speculation is rampant that among other things Aoba was more financially problematic than the suitors had been able to see from public documents. "No investment banker is being candid about what happened there," said Craig Chudler, an equity strategist at Nikko Salomon Smith Barney. "But I think AIG and Pinault must have seen something that shocked them."
Large Japanese companies such as Nissan are structured so that a vast galaxy of satellite companies, typically suppliers of parts and services, are locked into orbit around them by a combination of investments, loans and business relationships.
The potential liabilities associated with many of those companies -- the losses they sustain, the debts they cannot repay, the shortages in their pension funds -- often ultimately fall upon the main company but are not fully reflected in its public financial records, nor is such disclosure required.
If, for instance, the core company's investment in a satellite is now worth half what it originally paid, the decline in value is not necessarily reflected on the balance sheet.
Nissan, for instance, has 201 affiliates whose overall performance is reflected in its financial statements. Beyond that cluster, Nissan is linked to 389 companies whose fortunes are not reflected on its books but whose problems may become its own.
Keiichi Tsuboi, a spokesman for Nissan, noted that its interests in those 389 companies constitute less than 10 percent of its total revenue on a consolidated basis, a limit imposed by Japanese accounting rules.
"Of course, there are debts at the unconsolidated companies, but we don't think the total debt is significant," Mr. Tsuboi said.
As of April 1, many of the off-balance-sheet liabilities must start to appear on financial statements under new accounting rules that are expected to shake corporate Japan to its foundations -- though many obligations like loan guarantees may still remain hidden.
The new accounting rules will expose just the sort of off-balance-sheet problems that Nissan disclosed last week. Its plans to recapitalize the sales unit of its troubled truck-making affiliate, the Nissan Diesel Motor Company, further raised sensitivity to the issue of unseen liabilities.
Nissan and Nissan Diesel said they would each invest 20 billion yen ($170 million) in the unit, the Nissan Diesel Sales Company, even though Nissan's only exposure to it was through its 39.8 percent stake in Nissan Diesel. "A gap has emerged between the book value of the investment made in domestic dealerships which are owned by Nissan Diesel Motor Sales and the real value of those dealerships," Nissan said in a press statement.
The gap Nissan referred to was equivalent to roughly half the book value of the investment in the sales unit, and its magnitude surprised many analysts. Nissan Diesel sold only half as many trucks last year as the year before, leaving its dealers with bloated inventories and no way to repay their loans.
Some analysts had suspected as much, but because the sales unit is not a public company and does not disclose financial information, the analysts had no way of gauging the extent of Nissan's exposure.
"Maybe I'm just stupid, but I had no idea the losses in that business would run so high," said Peter Boardman of Warburg Dillon Read here. "Yes, it was good news in that they were able to overcome a crisis, but it also allowed the market to see how big the losses were."

A Long-Shot House Vote to Limit Steel Imports

BYLINE: By LESLIE WAYNE 

 BODY:
With surprising force and fury, the House's vote to limit steel imports reflects a strong sense of frustration within the domestic steel industry over low-price steel that landed on American shores during economic crises in Asia and Russia last year.
But the measure, a violation of world trade rules and a long shot at best in the Senate, would do little to help the American steel industry in the long run, even if the measure -- or a form of it -- were to be enacted. The industry is still losing about 10,000 jobs a year, is saddled with plants that are very expensive to run and is constantly buffeted by economic forces beyond its control from lands far away. 
 Oddly enough, this measure, decried as a protectionist gift to gain union votes for the 2000 election by both parties, comes as the American steel industry begins to recover from the wave of imports that drove down steel prices to 25-year lows last year. The industry is about to benefit from a growing demand for steel products from an economy that continues to remain strong.
That is the good news for the short run. Within the next year, analysts expect that there will be enough demand to keep American steel manufacturers running at full capacity. Just this month, steelmakers pushed through a price increase and have seen that imports, which last year caused havoc in steel prices, are now beginning to return to more normal levels -- in January 1999 steel imports came to 2.7 million tons, compared with 2.5 million tons the previous January.
Still, American steelmakers fear that what happened to them in late 1998, when low-cost imports from Japan, Russia, Brazil and other economically troubled countries soared to nearly four million tons a month, or nearly 40 percent of the domestic market, will happen again. They contend that the industry, which faces falling employment and marginal profitability, cannot sustain a similar blow.
For that reason, even though many in the steel industry readily admit that the House's 289-to-141 vote for import limits was largely symbolic, it represents a renewed belief in the need for protectionist measures -- a view that free-trade advocates say is dangerous and which runs afoul of the Clinton Administration's free-market views. A Presidential veto remains possible. In fact, the House-passed measure is the first in a package of about eight trade bills that the steel industry and unions want to see introduced in the 106th Congress. The measure would limit steel imports to pre-1997 levels, in violation of World Trade Organization rules.
"This measure is both symbolic and real," said Curtis Barnette, the chief executive of Bethlehem Steel, who will speak on behalf of the bill before the Senate Finance Committee next Tuesday. "We are actively working with other steel companies and the unions to carry our message as forcefully as we can. We're pleased that the House has recognized what we are talking about." George Becker, president of the United Steelworkers of America, also praised the measure. "With 10,000 steelworkers already out of work, three major steel producers in bankruptcy, another on the brink, and virtually every steel producer experiencing huge losses, action isn't an option; it's an absolute necessity," he said.
Others, however, say that the steel industry's concerns are overstated and that their approach is dangerous -- a continuation on a decades-old pattern of calling on Washington for help. "This is very blatant politicking on behalf of Congress to appeal to special interests in the steel industry and unions," said Waldo Best, an analyst with Morgan Stanley. "It creates the image that something is being done, but nothing is really being done. This is a very political piece of legislation that won't do anything meaningful for the industry."
Robert W. Crandall, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, a Washington research group, said the measure "doesn't mean much."
"There is no doubt that the surge of imports had some effects on steel makers, but this measure will have little impact on the industry in the long run," he said. "The real problem for old-line big steel is that they are being eaten alive by the mini-mills, which are making life miserable for these big guys. We are talking about a long-drawn-out end game for big steel."
In the last half-century, the American steel industry has continued to shrink; today it has about 170,000 employees compared with 500,000 in the 1950's.
And, while the steel producers complain about low-cost imports, users of steel benefit. The General Motors Corporation, for instance, opposes the limits. "We are in opposition to this resolution and think it's a rush to judgment that will probably have serious economic implications," the company said.
Overseas steel producers often operate in the same way as big steel makers here but, at times of economic turmoil in their home countries, they have shipped steel products to the United States at extremely low prices in an attempt to to stabilize their economies. These overseas producers often have far lower labor costs than in the United States.
Ken Hoffman, a steel analyst with Prudential Securities, said that by the time United States steel companies -- which have successfully filed anti-dumping suits against Brazil and Japan -- got relief in the form of high tariff protections, the crisis would have passed. Moreover, Mr. Hoffman said the House vote also reflected anti-Clinton sentiment both in the House and in the industry over the Administration's slow response.
Supporters of free trade and some steel importers were adamant in their opposition to import restrictions. "This is one of the worst pieces of legislation to come out of the House, and that's saying a lot," said Dan Griswold, associate director for trade policy studies at the Cato Institute. "There is not a steel crisis issue. Just look at the high level of steel shipments."
David Phelps, the executive director of the American Institute for International Steel, a trade group, added: "The steel industry is historically addicted to trade protection and that addiction has yet to be broken. We hope the Senate will give this ridiculous bill the indecent burial it deserves."

Silicon Valley's Awesome Look at New Sony Toy

BYLINE: By JOHN MARKOFF 

DATELINE: SAN JOSE, Calif., March 18

 BODY:
On a giant video screen, a lifelike rubber duck splashed about in a bathtub fleeing from a pursuing submarine. Suddenly the drain opened and both were swept into the resulting whirlpool.
What made this demonstration today by the Sony Corporation notable was that the scene, rendered with almost perfect realism down to each reflection in each ripple in the tub, was not a movie but an interactive video game that signaled a new level of computing power for everyday consumers. 
 Sony's Playstation II, though still more than a year away from store shelves, is creating a stir here in Silicon Valley because it is the first machine to deliver graphics that until now could be produced only by supercomputers -- and at prices that will put it under Christmas trees in 2000.
Shown for the first time in the United States, to 1,000 software game developers, the machine suggested that the state of the art in computing is moving from the aisles of CompUSA to the shelves of Toys "R" Us.
Playstation II, which Sony says it expects to sell for substantially less than $500, is perhaps the most striking example yet of a coming generation of powerful computer processors that are not designed for traditional computers. Instead, they are engineered to concentrate all their considerable power on performing highly specialized tasks.
The new Sony machine will not process text or calculate a budget, but it will take a generation of youngsters to the threshhold of virtual reality.
"I think what you're seeing is the transition from people playing video games to a world where we will create our own fantasies in cyberspace," said Larry Smarr, director of the National Center for Supercomputer Applications, in Champaign-Urbana, Ill.
Playstation II was developed by Sony and the Toshiba Corporation in a joint venture that adds up to an estimated $2 billion gamble on the future of consumer electronics. Though the two companies are playing down speculation that their new chip could catapult them into competition with makers of personal computer hardware and software, many opportunities are obviously ahead for a machine that generates graphics at more than twice the speed of the most powerful engineering work stations.
The brain of Playstation II is a microprocessor that the two companies have dubbed the Emotion Engine. It is designed to draw tens of millions of tiny polygons, the building blocks of computer graphics, on a television screen every second. As a result, it renders animated graphics with the realism of the movie "Toy Story" but in what is known as "real time." That is, it creates movement, characters and entire environments on the fly in response to the movement of a joystick or other gaming device.
"Sony is clearly riding on a consumer mandate and delivering supercomputer graphics," said Richard Doherty, president of Envisioneering, a computer industry consulting firm in Seaford, N.Y. "People will buy the Playstation II just to get at the chip."
Sony executives said they intended the name Emotion Engine to convey the hope that game developers would use the chip's power to create virtual worlds rich in subtlety and nuance.
"We're hoping that you will go beyond driving and shooting and killing people," Phil Harrison, a vice president at Sony Computer Entertainment, told the developers. "We are looking for a new generation of software that has the same impact on a person as a great book or a great movie."
He said the new processor had enough power to begin to convey humanlike motions and abilities, ranging from natural movement and facial expressions to artificial intelligence like the ability to learn and to recognize speech.
The Emotion Engine is the most recent example of a reversal under way in technological development. For decades, the most advanced consumer electronics were technologies that trickled down from the world of supercomputing, the Departments of Defense and Energy and NASA. That process has been turned on its head, mostly by the economics of the consumer electronics industry, which has evolved from a beneficiary of cutting-edge computer engineering to its driving force.
Since the end of the cold war, increasingly powerful computer products have begun showing up first in consumer applications. For graphics and related multimedia processing, for example, the Emotion Engine is significantly more powerful than the Intel Corporation's newest Pentium III microprocessor and has more than twice the graphics power of the most powerful Silicon Graphics work station, the benchmark for graphics computing power.
Yet, benchmarks and flashy graphics do not guarantee success in a computer. Indeed, Silicon Valley is littered with news releases from companies that promised to shake up the world with ever-faster computers. The vast majority failed to leave the laboratory and "auger in" to the market, in local parlance.
The Emotion Engine is unlikely to suffer that fate, if only because of the market muscle behind its developers. Still, production in quantity awaits the completion of a modern semiconductor plant that Sony and Toshiba expect to go on line next year.
What is more, some analysts questioned Sony's announcing Playstation II before it is available. It will arrive on the market later than its main competition, the Sega Dreamcast machine, which was recently introduced in Japan.
Sony executives went to some pains today to assert that their new machine was not a competitor to Wintel, the combination of the Microsoft Corporation's Windows operating system and Intel's Pentium microprocessors that dominates the personal computer industry.
"There are certain things the PC does really well, such as running as a server and displaying Powerpoint slides," said Mr. Harrison, the Sony Computer Entertainment executive.
Still, the company has given every indication that it envisions a new computing world that has little to do with the office desktop. In this world, brilliant graphics and mathematics-intensive tasks like voice recognition will matter most. And it is in this world, Mr. Harrison said, that the Emotion Engine will excel.
But it is clear to computer designers that the potential for Sony's computer is enormous because its graphics power will be coupled with high-speed connections to the Internet through cable and satellite links.
While company executives were coy about that possibility, they did announce that the Playstation II would incorporate ports for the two fastest communications channels available today -- Firewire and the Universal Serial Bus. It is also noteworthy that the machine will ship with the industry-standard slots for connecting peripherals like modems, network cards, hard drives and flash memory to laptop computers. Firewire is evolving as the standard for connecting a new generation of digital video cameras.
These features could make Sony a powerful competitor to Microsoft if software developers begin to abandon the personal computer platform when creating their newest and most advanced applications.
"This machine heralds the merger of film, television and the video game businesses," said Stewart A. Halpern, a Wall Street analyst at ING Baring Furman Selz.
Others are already looking to take Playstation II beyond games.
"This is the first credible alternative to the PC for reaching people on the Internet," said Carl Malamud, chairman of Invisible Worlds, an Internet software company in Redwood City, Calif.

HEADLINE: Millions Are Problem Gamblers, Report Says

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 18

 BODY:
More than 5 million Americans are pathological or problem gamblers, and 15 million more are at risk of becoming just like them, said a study released today that was conducted for the National Gambling Impact Study Commission.
Despite that finding, the study said that the economic impact of the problem gambling was "relatively small." 
 A second report, also released today as the commission began two days of meetings in Washington, estimated that 1.8 million American adults as well as up to 1.1 million American adolescents ages 12 through 17 engaged in severe "pathological" gambling each year.
The commission has three months to finish a wide-ranging report on gambling for Congress, and the extent of compulsive gambling in the country is just one of several open issues. Yet gambling addiction is the most contentious topic.
The report said the annual economic cost of problem gambling was about $5 billion in legal fees for divorce, court and jail costs for arrests, lost wages and bankruptcy.

U.S. TRADE DEFICIT SOARS AS IMPORTS INCREASE SHARPLY

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 18

 BODY:
As American exports continued to fall, the United States trade deficit jumped to a monthly record of nearly $17 billion in January, fueled by a flood of imports from China that could stir further protectionist sentiments in Congress.
Among the imports flowing into the United States, Chinese-made steel surged 65 percent from December. On Wednesday, the House of Representatives overwhelmingly passed a bill that would sharply limit steel imports, a movement that may gain momentum now that China is joining Japan, Brazil and Russia on the list of nations pouring inexpensive steel into the American market. 
 The figures were released today just as China and the United States entered a critical phase in negotiations over China's push to enter the World Trade Organization, which sets the rules for international trade. China wants the international prestige that comes from joining the trade organization and would also get a measure of protection against trade barriers to its exports.
Intense talks are under way in Geneva over the terms of China's entry in hopes of reaching an agreement before the Prime Minister of China, Zhu Rongji, visits Washington in early April. The deadline has breathed life into talks that have sputtered for a decade.
One American negotiator said this week that "we've made more progress with the Chinese in the last three weeks than in the last three years," and this morning President Clinton's top economic advisers met at the White House to assess China's intentions.
But they emerged uncertain -- both about the prospects of getting China to dismantle huge barriers and the prospects of getting any deal though Capitol Hill, where it would become instantly wrapped up in the politics of nuclear espionage, human rights violations and growing anti-China sentiment.
"Altogether, we have a mounting series of problems that are going to be difficult to manage, to say the least," Commerce Secretary William M. Daley said today.
The soaring monthly trade deficit -- after a record $170 billion deficit for all of 1998 -- considerably exceeded analysts' expectations of $14.9 billion. The $16.99 billion deficit in goods and services was the highest since monthly statistics began being reported in 1992.
The deficit in manufactured goods rose to a record $23.42 billion in January from $20.5 billion in December. The United States, however, ran a $6.4 billion surplus in services, from consulting to insurance.
But the deficit also reflected the continued strength of the American economy, which has created an enormous demand for imported consumer goods. The sharp increase occurred even though there was no rise in the value of imported gasoline and other petroleum products, now selling at prices lower than at any point in the last quarter-century.
Perhaps the most worrisome part of the report was not the rise in imports but the falloff in exports. They decreased to $76.8 billion, from $79.5 billion in the month a year earlier, led by falling demand for farm goods including corn, oil seeds and cotton and manufactured products including oilfield drilling equipment, farm machinery, aircraft and autos. Imports of goods and services rose to $93.8 billion, compared with $89.6 billion in January 1998, led by shipments of foreign autos, food and consumer goods.
So far the decline in exports has had little effect on the unemployment rate or the growth of the economy, which expanded 6 percent in the fourth quarter of last year. Except in hard-hit steel towns, booming domestic consumer demand has made up for the falloff in exports. But the numbers suggest that the United States will not have export markets to fall back on if the domestic economy cools this year.
The export figures are particularly troublesome for the White House, where officials who once proclaimed that America's surging exports were creating jobs and fueling the economy are now arguing that rising imports can be healthy, too. Today, officials cautioned about reading too much into the January numbers.
"I don't worry much about the monthly numbers of any kind," Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin said today. "We are the only major economy that is growing at a robust rate." At the same time, Mr. Rubin and other Administration officials have begun explicitly warning Europe that the United States cannot be expected to continue to absorb such a huge share of the goods the rest of the world produces.
But so far, the United States remains the world's only real engine of growth -- meaning that the trade deficit will likely swell further this year. Despite hints that a modest revival may be in the offing, Japan remains in deep recession, and American exports to Japan fell 10 percent compared with those in January 1998. Perhaps more politically important, exports to China for the month were down to $779 million from $1.35 billion in December, a tiny figure compared with imports of $5.56 billion. Put another way, the ratio of United States imports to exports with China is 7 to 1. With Japan it is roughly 2 to 1, suggesting that the problems of access to the Chinese market are far worse.
The Administration argues that a deal to get China into the World Trade Organization would solve some of those problems over the long run. It would force China to sharply reduce its protective tariffs, and it would include access to the Chinese market for American food producers, banks, insurance companies and other businesses. American computer makers are pushing hard for a deal and wrote to Congress this week urging a relaxing of export restrictions of American technology there -- something that stands little chance of happening given the politics of relations between China and the United States this week.
The combination of allegations about spying at American weapons laboratories and the rising deficit with China combine into a sense that China is intent on playing outside the rules -- and many members of Congress think that W.T.O. membership would be a reward to Beijing.
That belief could hinder any chances for a deal, a senior Chinese diplomat, He Yafei, said at a news conference today.
"I believe the political atmosphere will have a bearing on any negotiation between our two countries," he said. "Especially when some members or senators are saying, 'Even if you have a deal, even if that deal is good for the U.S. business community, we will not give China permanent normal trade relations.' "
Mr. He concluded, "That is absurd."

U.S. Trade Deficit Soars To Almost $17 Billion
The nation's trade deficit jumped to a monthly record of nearly $17 billion in January, fueled by a flood of imports from China that could stir further protectionist sentiments in Congress. 
 Among the imports pouring into the United States was Chinese-made steel, which increased 65 percent from December. The House of Representatives passed a bill Wednesday that, if enacted, would sharply limit steel imports, ignoring opposition from the Republican leadership and a White House warning that the measure would violate world trade agreements. Page A1.
 
The House's vote to limit steel imports reflects a sense of frustration within the domestic steel industry over the low-priced steel that landed on American shores during the economic crises in Asia and Russia last year. C3.
 
Tobacco Companies Win Ohio Suit
In a significant legal victory for tobacco companies, a Federal jury in Akron, Ohio, ruled that they do not have to reimburse dozens of union health and benefit plans in that state for the costs of treating smoking-related illnesses. A verdict in favor of the union plans, which were seeking up to $2 billion in damages, could have created financial turmoil for some cigarette makers. After the verdict, tobacco company stocks rose, with shares of Philip Morris gaining $3.75, to $42. A10.

Northrop Grumman said that it would restate its results for the fourth quarter of 1998, taking a loss because of a write-off associated with an investment in a start-up rocket company, Kistler Aerospace. C2.
 
Adobe Posts Strong Profits
The computer graphics software maker Adobe Systems posted a first-quarter profit that was stronger than expected and said it would also beat second-quarter forecasts. C16.
 
Gucci Posts 11% Gain in Profit
Gucci Group reported an 11 percent increase in fiscal 1999 earnings and said the strong results showed that the Italian fashion house needed no help from LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton, the French luxury goods maker that is trying to take it over. The figures were hastily released on the day LVMH said its own earnings in fiscal 1998 and the first half of fiscal 1999 slumped. Bernard Arnault, LVMH's chairman, attributed the bad results to losses at the DFS Group, a duty-free operator acquired in 1997 that lost $37 million in 1998. Without those losses, he said, LVMH earnings would have risen 6 percent. C4.
 
Nike earnings rose 70 percent in the third quarter, partly because of cost cutting. C5.
 
FDX, the parent company of Federal Express, posted profits that were better than expected despite the drag of $90 million spent on preparing for a strike. C5.
 
BMW said that its profit fell nearly 28 percent in 1998 as losses at the British unit Rover dragged down corporate earnings. C3.

HEADLINE: On My Mind;
A Return to India

BYLINE: By A. M. ROSENTHAL 

DATELINE: NEW DELHI

 BODY:
When I was young in India, for four years I reported a story I wrote of as "the great adventure" and believed was one of the most important of our century.
During the decade after India became independent a half-century ago, I relished that story: Almost alone among countries newly freed from colonialism, India had chosen and kept democracy as its governance. The others mostly went quickly under hard-boot government -- Communism, Fascism, militarism, juntaism, whatever it chose to be called. 
 Each time I return, I know India's decision remains central and hopeful for itself and the world. But America and its allies think about India with a mixture of condescension and irritability at its desire to be seen and heard -- when they think of it at all.
Every Indian government has resented "India Who?" but somehow managed to carry on. For precisely a year, for instance, India has been writing some pages in its history that may shape the adventure as none since Nehru died in 1964 and his Congress Party ousted itself from power by arrogance and corruption.
The current ruling coalition, 14 parties headed by the Hindu-centered Bharatiya Janata Party, will stay in power or lose it depending on three things. One is the ability of Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee to wean his party from the wildly bigoted Hindu-first hard-liners and toward a moderation they detest. Another is his still-forming economic strategy. How far and fast will he move India from its mixture of private enterprise and strangulation by regulation toward economic openness inviting to investment?
But to move at all he will have to end the outbreak of persecution of the small Christian minority. Churches have been burned, worshipers beaten and murdered.
The police dawdle. A government investigation commission has publicly protested its lack of resources and power.
This in a country where a man once considered an untouchable is President, where people of almost every minority -- Muslims, Christians, Sikhs, Jews, Buddhists -- have reached high office, where Mother Teresa received a state funeral. It is a country where civil peace depends on the constitutional guarantees of equality among India's religions -- almost as many as the world's.
Christians are only 2 percent of India's billion people. But what one minority suffers, all others fear.
The persecution is the work of Hindu nationalists supporting Mr. Vajpayee. He will have to choose between issuing one more denunciation of the persecution and taking action that will cost him extremist backing that helped bring him to office.
All these years, India's political and religious leaders and its wealthy have failed the Indian people. For hundreds of millions, the poverty is an insult to their very humanity.
India still has enough street-sleepers to populate a sizable nation. Scores of thousands in its capital live in hovels built on stilts so that perhaps during monsoons open sewers will not flood inside with excrement.
But through it all Indians consistently insisted on their own fundamentalism -- the right to vote politicians into office, or out.
The West sometimes remembers India, as when India wins its attention by carrying out nuclear tests.
But Kosovo, Bosnia, Somalia, bananas -- those are the big "foreign" concerns for Americans. Also: Can we succeed in appeasing China, which is a perpetual threat to India? Can we make China stronger with trade that costs us military secrets and a yearly commercial imbalance of $50 billion?
Europeans at least are consistent, historically regarding Asia as a mango to be sliced up or squeezed into juice.
Strange thing -- not a Western word is said about where the world would be if Indians had chosen the Mao or Stalin way, or Saddam's. We certainly would not be one bit condescending or irritable about India.
We would be too busy worrying about how to deal with a totalitarian axis running through Asia, the Pacific, the Mideast and Eastern Europe, headquartered in Beijing, Moscow and New Delhi -- if we were allowed to deal at all.
Indians chose the freedom of democracy for their sakes, not ours. Still, it is nice to remember that choose it they did, and still are.

HEADLINE: U.S. Official Questions How Russia Used Loan

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 18

 BODY:
The Treasury Secretary, Robert E. Rubin, told a Congressional panel today that he suspected that much of the $4.8 billion in loans sent to Russia last summer by the International Monetary Fund "may have been siphoned off improperly."
It was the Clinton Administration's first public statement supporting accusations that bailout money simply helped wealthy Russian oligarchs move billions of dollars to Switzerland and other safe havens. 
 Financial regulators note that a huge flow of dollars left Russia immediately after the monetary fund's cash was delivered to the Russian central bank, suggesting investors were getting out before the ruble was permitted to collapse on Aug. 17.
The timing of Mr. Rubin's comments was particularly significant because Russia's Prime Minister, Yevgeny M. Primakov, arrives here in five days on a mission to obtain the next installment of $22 billion in loans. It is unclear whether he will succeed, though there is growing pressure on the I.M.F. to lend Russia just enough money to allow it to pay back several billion dollars that it owes to the fund in coming months.
Mr. Primakov has been publicly pushing the move, which amounts to accounting sleight-of-hand, for two months now, chiefly because it would keep Russia from formal default.
Mr. Rubin suggested today that, despite endemic corruption and Mr. Primakov's seeming inability to put together an economic plan, the United States still had an interest in financially aiding the country. The United States has the largest block of votes within the I.M.F.
"If Russia destabilizes, the costs to the United States are going to be vastly greater than anything we can think of," Mr. Rubin said.
After his testimony before a House appropriations subcommittee, Mr. Rubin once again deflected reports that he might be planning to resign. Such reports have sprung up repeatedly in recent years and resurfaced after the conclusion of President Clinton's impeachment trial.
The relative calm in the world economy has contributed to the revival of the rumors. And this week, the Treasury Department announced that Mr. Rubin would not be attending an annual meeting of Asian finance ministers in May, because the meeting conflicted with Mr. Rubin's commitments to make several commencement addresses.
In a conversation today after his appearance before the House panel, Mr. Rubin qualified his testimony by saying that "it may have been careless to use the word 'improper' " because "there is nothing improper about moving money out of Russia or any other country."
In this case, however, the capital flight may have helped buy time for a group of Russia's most powerful business executives, who wanted to convert their rubles to dollars before the ruble was devalued.
The money from the fund went to the Russian central bank. And the bank spent it to intervene in the markets and buy rubles for several weeks. Some money may also have been provided to banks, giving their clients access to dollars in return for ruble deposits. The result was that the $4.8 billion was quickly drained away, and a similar amount appeared in overseas bank accounts. This only could have been avoided with capital controls, rules that prevent taking money out of the country, which the United States has rarely supported in recent years.
"Money is fungible," said Mr. Rubin, "so it is hard to say exactly what happened to it. I can't tell you exactly what happened."
The bitter experience of last July, though, has left the I.M.F. wary about making a second loan installment. Some fear that giving Russia more money than it currently owes would invite a repetition of the capital flight. Moreover, Russia has made scant progress on economic reforms that the fund could seize upon as a reason for new loans.
The budget Russia adopted recently is considered largely unrealistic by American officials and the fund itself. There has been little progress on tax collection in Russia, the I.M.F. says, and just the other day the Russian parliament cut a value-added tax, angering fund officials.
The Russians are also angry. They argue that the fund's conditions are far too stringent and will contribute to the country's recession. The fund's managing director, Michel Camdessus, engaged in an unusual public exchange with Mr. Primakov's aides several weeks ago, and another top I.M.F. official told the Trilateral Commission here this weekend that Russia's Government is so weak that its economic commitments cannot be trusted.
Mr. Rubin, while more elliptical, made a similar point today in his testimony. "If Russia is going to have a successful economy, there are going to have to be a whole host of reforms that provide the framework for a market economy," Mr. Rubin told the House subcommittee.

Jobless Rate Edges Up

BYLINE: AP 

 BODY:
New York's jobless rate inched upward in February to 5.3 percent, nearly a full percentage point higher than the national average for last month, the State Labor Department reported yesterday.
Analysts said there were some positive trends in the state's employment picture last month, including a record for private-sector jobs, at 6,761,000, and a year-to-year drop in joblessless from 6.0 percent in February 1998 to 5.3 percent last month. 
 Unemployment fell nationally to 4.4 percent last month from 4.6 percent in February 1998, statisticians reported. New York's jobless rate in January was 5.2 percent on a seasonably adjusted rate.

HEADLINE: Call by Call, Hillary Clinton Queries New York Leaders

BYLINE: By ELISABETH BUMILLER 

 BODY:
In the month since announcing her interest in a United States Senate seat from New York, Hillary Rodham Clinton has discussed her potential candidacy with more than 50 influential Democrats in the state, most often in lengthy telephone calls she placed from the private quarters of the White House.
Mrs. Clinton, over the last few weeks, talked about her possible political future with labor leaders, elected officials and Democratic party chairmen from suburban and upstate counties crucial to winning a race. She also recently entertained powerful New York Democrats and public figures at the White House, including Dennis Rivera, the labor leader. 
 Several of those who spoke with Mrs. Clinton said she did not hint at her ultimate decision, but was systematically studying the politics and issues of a state where she has never lived. A number of them said she told them that she planned to do polling and was looking for ways to raise money even before she made a decision on the race.
Many of the county officials, who seem stunned and pleased by the First Lady's attention, described their conversations about local issues with Mrs. Clinton as lengthy and very detailed.
"She's obviously been doing her homework," said Steve Pigeon, the Democratic chairman of Erie County, the state's largest Democratic stronghold outside of New York City. Mr. Pigeon said he spoke by phone to Mrs. Clinton for an hour on Monday night. "I have to explain to a lot of candidates who come to me that you can't view upstate monolithically," he said. "She already knew the vast differences."
Mr. Pigeon said Mrs. Clinton told him she did not want her delay in making a decision to undercut the ability of other potential Democratic candidates -- like Representative Nita M. Lowey of Westchester -- to raise money.
Largely because of the possible impact on other likely candidates and their ability to raise money if Mrs. Clinton does not run, many Democrats have been irked by her announcement that she will not decide until "later this year," perhaps as late as the fall. The election is in November 2000.
In an apparent response to that concern, the First Lady and her advisers are exploring fund-raising options. "She said they're looking for vehicles to raise money to be used for whoever the candidate is," Mr. Pigeon said. "I think as long as she's raising money that can be used no matter who runs, whether it's her or Nita, that can buy some time."
Election law lawyers said yesterday that such a vehicle might be a committee, allowed under Federal election law, that would raise money for an unspecified Senate candidate in donations of up to $1,000.
In making her calls, Mrs. Clinton works from a list of 200 names provided by Harold M. Ickes, a former White House official and a veteran of New York politics. Mrs. Clinton's advisers say she has methodically made her way through the Democratic power structure in New York State, reaching out not only to labor leaders and local Democratic leaders, but to fund-raisers, members of the New York Congressional delegation and leaders of black, Jewish, Hispanic and women's groups.
She has also had meetings at the White House -- yesterday with the New York City Comptroller, Alan G. Hevesi, and last Friday with New York's Assembly Speaker, Sheldon Silver.
Mr. Hevesi said that he and the First Lady spoke for more than an hour, half of which he said was spent discussing the case of Amadou Diallo, the unarmed African immigrant whose shooting death by the New York City police has led to protests against Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, a potential opponent of Mrs. Clinton. Mr. Hevesi said Mrs. Clinton brought up the case herself, but made no comment on Mr. Giuliani's handling of it.
Mr. Silver said he met for an hour and 45 minutes with the First Lady. In another indication that Mrs. Clinton may be positioning herself as a candidate, Mr. Silver said that she elaborated on her remarks last year that a Palestinian state was "very important" to Middle East peace.
Mr. Giuliani has called her comments "a very big mistake," and political analysts have said her remarks could give him a chance to cut into any support she has among conservative Jewish voters.
Mr. Silver said Mrs. Clinton told him that her remarks were a "reflection of her discussions" with Yitzhak Rabin, the late Israeli Prime Minister, "and that Rabin had told her that 'it was very difficult to negotiate with a nonentity.' Mrs. Clinton also said her remarks were "not inconsistent with American policy," the Speaker added.
Most upstate and suburban Democratic party officials said they came away from speaking with her believing that she would be a candidate.
"I thought I was talking to a political pro," said Steve Paquette, the Onondaga County Democratic chairman, who spoke to Mrs. Clinton for a half-hour last Thursday. "I honestly think for her to be taking the next broad step of calling folks like me, that's more than sticking your toe in the water."
Mrs. Clinton often calls at the end of the working day, sometimes after Mr. Ickes -- who now has his own Washington consulting firm -- has paved the way.
Paul Adler, the Rockland County Democratic chairman, said that last week, Mr. Ickes called him and asked him about local issues, and then Mrs. Clinton called to talk about property taxes, suburban development, the regional economy and transportation into New York City.
Mr. Ickes said that Mrs. Clinton was educating herself about New York through her phone calls, which she made alone. "She's finding out the lay of the political landscape, the lay of the issue landscape," he said.
Although most active Democratic Party workers are clamoring for Mrs. Clinton to run, many have also told her that the race will be very close and that she should expect personal attacks for her role in the Whitewater inquiry and her past spectacularly profitable trades in the commodities markets.
"I certainly indicated that it would be a tough race," said Dominic Baranello, the Democratic Party chairman of heavily Republican Suffolk County. He said he told Mrs. Clinton last week that the Republicans "would revive many of the issues we've been hearing about ad nauseam" and that "she has to be prepared to handle that."
Some local Democratic leaders say they have been taken aback by the intricacy of Mrs. Clinton's questions. "She was curious about why there was a large Jordanian population in Yonkers," said David Alpert, the Westchester County Democratic chairman, who spoke to Mrs. Clinton for nearly an hour. "I did not know the answer."
Mr. Alpert also said that he and Mrs. Clinton talked about friends and colleagues they had in common in Westchester -- Ronald H. Brown, the late Secretary of Commerce, who was a Democratic district leader in Mount Vernon in the 1970's, and Toby Nussbaum, a former county Democratic finance chairman who is married to Bernard W. Nussbaum, a former White House counsel.
The White House dinner that the President and Mrs. Clinton held for some influential New Yorkers took place March 5, in the family quarters. The guests included New York's State Comptroller, H. Carl McCall; Randi Weingarten, the president of the United Federation of Teachers; Mr. Rivera, the president of Local 1199, National Health and Human Service Employees Union; Bill Lynch, longtime adviser to former Mayor David N. Dinkins; Victor A. Kovner, a First Amendment lawyer and a corporation counsel in the Dinkins administration; and Sarah Kovner, a special assistant to the Federal Secretary of Health and Human Services, Donna E. Shalala, and Mr. Kovner's wife.
The guests were up until 1:30 A.M. having dinner and watching a movie ("October Sky"). Afterward, the New Yorkers slept at the White House. None stayed, said one sleep-over guest, in the Lincoln Bedroom.

CORRECTION-DATE: March 20, 1999, Saturday

 CORRECTION:
An article yesterday about Hillary Rodham Clinton's preparations for a possible Senate campaign referred incorrectly to the accommodations for a group of New Yorkers who recently stayed overnight at the White House. Two guests -- State Comptroller H. Carl McCall and his wife, Dr. Joyce Brown -- indeed slept in the Lincoln Bedroom.

Treasuries Are Sharply Lower In Advance of AT&T Offering

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
Treasury bond prices posted their biggest loss in two weeks on speculation the AT&T Corporation would increase its bond sale from the $6 billion or more already planned.
"Everybody's going to buy it," said Closson Vaughan, who helps manage about $2.5 billion at Columbia Partners in Washington. "It will probably be upsized." He said he would probably buy some of the bonds, which will serve as bellwethers for the corporate bond market. 
 The price of the 30-year Treasury bond fell 29/32, to 95 22/32. The bond's yield, which moves in the opposite direction, rose to 5.55 percent, from 5.48 percent on Thursday.
Other companies are also selling debt, giving investors a higher-yielding alternative to United States bonds. Fannie Mae, the R & B Falcon Corporation and the Anadarko Petroleum Corporation sold a combined $3.3 billion yesterday. Wall Street firms arranging corporate debt sales often sell Treasuries first to protect against losses in case interest rates rise before the corporate sale is completed.
Investors said AT&T had received about $11 billion of tentative orders for its bonds, leading to speculation the nation's biggest telephone company might sell more debt than previously announced. The sale is likely to surpass the record $6.1 billion sold last year by the No. 2 long-distance company, MCI Worldcom Inc., investors said.
AT&T needs about $15 billion to pay for recent acquisitions, its share repurchase program and to repay existing debt, analysts said. The possibility of such a large sale is "weighing heavily on the market," said Tony Crescenzi, head government trader at Miller Tabak Hirsch & Company.
Volume was lighter than usual, as it was all week. About $41 billion of bills, notes and bonds had traded through most of the major bond brokers by 3 P.M. yesterday, 21.4 percent less than the average for Fridays the last month, according to Govpx Inc., a bond pricing service.
Fannie Mae, the biggest mortgage financier in the United States, sold $2 billion of five-year notes by expanding a $4 billion issue sold last month. R & B Falcon, the No. 4 oil and gas drilling contractor in the United States, increased its sale 25 percent, to $1 billion. Anadarko raised $300 million.

Old-Fashioned Cafeteria Edging Toward Oblivion

BYLINE: By MICHAEL JANOFSKY

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 19

 BODY:
How about the liver and onions for $2.25? Or fried whiting, the most expensive entree on the menu, for $3.95? For dessert, the pudding will set a diner back only 65 cents, or he can splurge, with homemade rhubarb pie for $1.65.
"Let's see, I had liver and onions, mashed potatoes with gravy, the pineapple-lettuce salad and lemon meringue pie," said John Kendrick, a retired professor at George Washington University who has been eating at Sholl's restaurants since he moved to Washington in 1941. "For all that, I think I paid $5.45. Maybe it was $5.50 but no more than that." 
 For home-style cooking, reasonable prices and a friendly atmosphere, there is nothing else in the nation's capital quite like Sholl's Colonial Cafeteria at 20th and K Streets downtown. As an old-fashioned slide-your-tray-along-and-keep-the-line-moving kind of place, there may be few like it in other big cities.
Trouble is, in a month or two, the last of the Sholl chain of cafeterias, serving institutional cuisine for 71 years, might follow the automat and tailfins into cultural oblivion.
As Washington's economic fortunes and downtown rental rates rise, the owners of the office building where the last Sholl's -- there once were eight of them -- has operated for 20 years are asking for a 20 percent rent increase above the current $20,000 a month, by early summer, to bring Sholl's more in line with other businesses in the neighborhood. Sholl's 10-year lease expired this month.
The demand has not only forced George Fleishell, 71, the cafeteria's majority owner and nephew of the founders, Evan and Gertrude Scholl, to contemplate closing the cafeteria, it has also brought sadness and defiance among devoted customers, some of whom have formed a group to fight to keep the cafeteria open.
"This is totally outrageous," said Jim McGrath, a retired analyst at the Library of Congress and chairman of the Save Our Sholl's Committee, who describes his mission as "a labor of love and a labor of anger."
Mr. McGrath has called for another strategy session on Saturday morning at the cafeteria.
"The treatment these people are getting is beyond belief," he insisted.
Brian McVay, a senior managing director for the company that manages the building, Cushman & Wakefield, said through a spokeswoman, Sheila Peck, that policy precluded him from discussing negotiations in progress.
Were it not for the ambiance and affordability of Sholl's, and its place in Washington's culinary history -- Trumans, Nixons and Carters ate at Sholl's -- few people might care about its closing. But Mr. Fleishell and his predecessors have always demonstrated a certain civic conscience, keeping prices low enough for the poorest of residents while attracting high-priced lobbyists and lawyers.
"You need a place like this in the city," said Robert Cutts, an official with the Federal Communications Commission who was eating lunch with his wife, Barbara. "It would be a loss to the city if it closed, if for no other reason people of modest means can come here to get a good meal and be treated with respect, the same as anybody else."
The same expectations have also kept Sholl's popular with people like Ted Barnhill, a professor of finance at George Washington. Mr. Barnhill eats lunch at Sholl's several times a week, drawn by the simplicity and wholesomeness of the food. "If you want to eat hearty," he said, "this is a great place."
But low prices can only account for so much. Tastes and trends change. Like most other cities, Washington is rife with ethnic and fast-food restaurants downtown, and Mr. Fleishell said he had noticed a precipitous decline in the number of meals served over the years. Since the K Street cafeteria opened 20 years ago, he said, the lunch crowd, for example, has dropped to 600 people from 1,800.
"We have raised some prices on occasion," Mr. Fleishell said. "One of the most popular things used to be filet of haddock, at $2.95. Now, it's too expensive to handle. I'd have to charge $7."
Exactly what anyone can do to save Sholl's remains a question. Harold Brazil, a member of the City Council, said he might write a letter to the owners. Senator Max Cleland, a Georgia Democrat who first visited as a student at American University, is serving as honorary chairman of the Save Our Sholl's Committee to call attention to the situation. Mr. McGrath said friendly persuasion might encourage the building owners to lower the rent increase.
Albert B. Krachman, Mr. Fleishell's lawyer, concluded that it might just come down to public embarrassment.
"With all the outflow of support, the landlords should see this as a chance to get a great public image, contribute to the community and become a hero," Mr. Krachman said. "Or they could close a public institution that's been around for 71 years, put people out and be regarded as an oppressive pariah."

The Teacher in Charge Is Taught a Thing or Two

BYLINE: By CRAIG R. WHITNEY 

DATELINE: PARIS, March 19

 BODY:
Trying to change the education system in a country that fears any change is a thankless job, Claude Allegre, the feisty French Minister of Education, says with some exasperation.
Teaching and research in geophysics, his real profession for most of the last 35 years, were much more fun, he said over lunch with a group of foreign correspondents. 
 Eyes twinkling behind professorial rimless spectacles, hands clasped around his ample middle, Mr. Allegre, 61, looked like a man with a taste for work and joie de vivre. If schools could just teach children how to appreciate both those things, he said, they would be doing their job.
But since his old friend Lionel Jospin, the Prime Minister, picked Mr. Allegre in 1997 to run the large French education bureaucracy, he has become one of the most vilified politicians in France.
He doesn't mince words with his fellow teachers in the national system. When he took the Minister's job, he said, he saw his task as cutting out the fat. That put the more than a million teachers on their guard.
But when he criticized them for excess absenteeism and said it was a scandal that so many did not show up after summer vacation, some declared open war.
Now, "Allegre out" graffiti are plastered all over the Latin Quarter. Some 4,000 teachers took to the streets of Paris last month to demand his resignation, and one of the biggest secondary-school teachers' unions has called for a national demonstration on Saturday against legislation he has introduced to change the way French high schools, or lycees, prepare students for a university education.
Mr. Allegre takes it all in stride. "Not all teachers hate me," he said. "They see that the profession is in a period of great change, so they are anxious and defensive."
The French press often takes him to task for provocative statements, but he can't seem to help himself. "I said once that English is no longer a foreign language," he recalled with a laugh, "and did I get into trouble for that!"
It was an iconoclastic remark in a country where crusading against inroads from English is a sacred duty. "I do my bit every time I massacre the language by trying to speak it," he said modestly, in French.
Mr. Allegre, a professor's son, studied at the faculty of sciences of the University of Paris and in fact knows English well. He got a postdoctoral scholarship to the California Institute of Technology in 1964 and knows his way around places like Harvard and M.I.T. He is also a member of the American Academy of Sciences and several American professional organizations.
British and American higher education, he says, is the envy of the world. "Universities are the American education system," he said. "The rest isn't so good."
"I think our education system is still one of the best in the world, alas," he said, meaning the French system, "because the others have deteriorated even more than ours has."
But because, as he put it, "the lycee was the sickest part of our system," he began consulting teachers, parents and students soon after taking office about how to change the syllabus that leads up to the "bac" -- the baccalaureate diploma, without which no university study is possible. To get it, students have to pass a rigorous final examination that has been an annual spring ordeal dreaded by millions of families.
Five years ago, 65.5 percent did pass it. Now, partly because of juvenile delinquency and alienation among minority students of North African heritage, 62 percent of a generation has the bac.
But, Mr. Allegre pointed out, 20 years ago, only 34 percent got it. Most of the rest dropped out at 16 and entered the labor force.
"Today we generate more young unemployed people than any other society in Europe," he said. "The lycee broadened its syllabus and extended the school day, but lowered its standards and neglected the fundamentals. 'Close' isn't a good enough standard, but that's all a lot of teaching aims for."
Mr. Allegre's plan to change the system was announced in final form early this month. If approved by the French legislature, it would among other things institute individual tutorials in small groups for first-year lycee students having trouble with mathematics or French. Schools in disadvantaged areas like the heavily North African close-in suburbs of Paris would have priority.
Another part of the plan would create interdisciplinary independent study groups, guided by teachers, for students in the last two years of the three-year lycee cycle, with increased use of computers and information technology.
Special instructors -- artists for art courses, native speakers for languages -- would supplement the work of regular teachers. And new fields like physical and sports education would appeal to students turned off by the traditional curriculum of the past.
"The whole idea is to get teachers to help students," Mr. Allegre said. "In America and Britain that's understood." Here, the tradition always was that teachers taught, and students had to figure out for themselves how to learn.
"There's a great global challenge to education nowadays," he said, "and no country has really figured out the answer."
Meanwhile, Mr. Allegre said jokingly, he seizes any opportunity he can to teach physics. He was alluding to a running feud with the satirical weekly Le Canard Enchaine about a television appearance he made last month.
He had used the occasion to illustrate the inherent difficulty of mastering physics: If a beginning student was asked which would fall faster, a tennis ball or a heavy metal ball the same size dropped at the same time, he said, the answer would usually be the metal ball. "The truth is," he said, "that they land at the same time."
A few days later, the newspaper said Mr. Allegre was technically right, but only if the two balls were falling in a vacuum. Air resistance would slow down the tennis ball, it said, so the smoother, metal ball would indeed land first.
Mr. Allegre says he does not read newspapers but was alerted by his staff and sent a handwritten note to the editor, who published it on March 3. "One of your journalists thought he'd be smart and give me a physics lesson," the Minister's note read.
The acrimony continues in print, but Mr. Allegre says he doesn't mind. "I'm sure all the Canard Enchaine's readers have plunged into their physics books and are learning a lot," he said with a laugh.

HEADLINE: Realistic School Standards

 BODY:
The school standards movement is being undermined by a failure of political will. In state after state, politicians pander to the public with tough new standards and tests -- while failing to provide qualified teachers or the rudimentary labs necessary to prepare students adequately. When students fail the new tests, parents explode in outrage and the standards are eased, feeding the impression that public schooling is worthless and that some children can never learn.
New York State has embarked on a similar course. Anyone who doubts this should look at the 27 percent failure rate on a new English test prescribed by the state Board of Regents, one of five such Regents tests that students will eventually have to pass to graduate. In the near term, the state must take an active role in helping high school students who face a test for which their districts have failed to prepare them. In the long term, the state will need to embrace the broad preparation plan that the State Board of Regents recommended when it created the new standards. To do any less is courting civic disaster. 
 For most of its history, New York had a two-tiered testing system that led to two classes of diplomas. About 38 percent of high school students took the more challenging courses that led to the Regents High School Examinations, and for those who passed, the Regents diploma. But most students took less demanding courses and the Regents Competency Tests, leading to a local diploma.
The Board of Regents has scrapped the less challenging courses and tests and now wants virtually every student to take the math, science and English courses that lead to the Regents examination. The exam will initially have two passing grades, one for the Regents diploma and a lower one for the local diploma -- which will soon be phased out, making everyone reach for the Regents' mark.
The new standards do not kick in until next year. But a dry run in an English exam among current high school seniors whose results were released this week found that 27 percent across the state and 37 percent in New York City failed to achieve even the lower grade required for a local diploma. By contrast, under the old system, virtually everyone who took the weaker competency test got a local diploma. Given that next year's English test is longer and more difficult and that science and other subjects will be tested in subsequent years, the failure rates could soar much higher.
The Board of Regents hoped to avoid high failure rates by spending almost $900 million to bring all students up to speed while concentrating the bulk of that money on poor districts that have the least-qualified teachers and the worst facilities. But after welcoming the new standards and pledging to support them, Gov. George Pataki submitted a budget proposing only about $270 million and redirected much of the money toward affluent districts.
Students who do not get better preparation will fail the new tests in ever greater numbers. Those who repeat the 12th grade will make the current overcrowding problems even worse. As more students drop out and fail to get jobs, they will deaden an economy that already lags behind the nation's.
At the very least, the state should commit to furnishing all of its students with the instruction and tools they need to succeed. But doing that will require money, planning and vigorous leadership from the Governor and the Legislature.

HEADLINE: Record's Pluses Outweigh Lie, President Says

BYLINE: By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 19

 BODY:
President Clinton said today that when the final word was written on his legacy, he would have one strike against him -- for lying -- but "hundreds and hundreds and hundreds" of pluses for the times that he was truthful and had not abused his office.
He also said that he did not have "a clue" whether his wife, Hillary, would run for the Senate from New York. But he said publicly for the first time that she had long ago suggested they move to New York when he left office, although he implied they would be spending a lot of time apart because he would be in Arkansas at his Presidential library. He said they were "working" on their marriage, which has appeared stressed over the last year in the wake of revelations about his extramarital affair. 
 "We're working hard, and we love each other very much," Mr. Clinton said today.
 At his first full-dress news conference in nearly a year, held in the formal East Room of the White House, Mr. Clinton ranged over an array of foreign and domestic issues for an hour. He sprang to the defense of Vice President Al Gore for Mr. Gore's overdrawn references in his personal biography, and he deflected a question about whether he felt betrayed by former aides who have criticized his fitness for the Presidency. His tone was generally conversational, but he became visibly testy when he was asked whether his "legacy will be about lying."
Mr. Clinton, who admitted last year that he had lied when he denied having an affair with Monica S. Lewinsky, a White House intern, said that telling the truth was important.
"And even Presidents have to do that and there are consequences when you don't," he said in an understated reference to his impeachment on charges of perjury and obstruction of justice, on which he was acquitted five weeks ago.
Then he tensed and his voice rose with anger as he asserted that on balance, he had a strong record and that reporters needed to be careful about telling the truth too.
"There will be a box score, and there will be that one negative," he said, referring to his lying under oath. "And then there will be the hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of times when the record will show that I did not abuse my authority as President, that I was truthful with the American people, and scores and scores of allegations were made against me and widely publicized without any regard to whether they were true or not."
Of those accusations, he said: "Most of them have already been actually proved false. And it's very hard to disprove every false allegation against you. But we have had more success frankly than I was afraid we would when we started. So I would hope that there would be a higher regard for truth-telling by all people in public life and all those who report on it."
He declined today to discuss one of those accusations -- by an Arkansas woman, Juanita Broaddrick, that he sexually assaulted her in 1978 while he was State Attorney General. His lawyer has denied it.
Mr. Clinton said he wanted to devote all of his time to the nation's business and would therefore refer all such questions to his lawyers. Pressed as to whether he could not simply deny the accusation, Mr. Clinton ignored the question.
Mr. Clinton has been available only briefly to reporters since the impeachment ordeal began more than a year ago. Today's news conference was one in a series of steps the White House has taken to thaw the icy relations with reporters that have marked his tenure.
He has held two off-the-record dinners with reporters, and his spokesman, Joe Lockhart, said the President would now conduct news conferences on a more regular basis.
His intention today was to present himself as back to business, and he generally avoided being drawn into the past. "I think it's best for me not to focus on that now," he said when asked for his reflections on being impeached.
He was more comfortable with the topic of his wife's political ambitions, though he said he was clueless on what she would decide. "The people she is talking to must know more than I do, because I literally don't have a clue," he said. "If you asked me today whether I thought it was more likely or not that she would run or not run, I could not give you an answer. I just don't know."
He said that long before either of them knew that Daniel Patrick Moynihan, a Democrat who is the state's senior Senator, would vacate his seat, she thought they should move to New York. Today he seemed to be trying to preempt criticism that Mrs. Clinton was a carpetbagger.
The President, who has given few hints about his post-Presidential plans, said of his wife: "She thought we should move to New York when I left the White House, knowing that I would spend a lot of time at home in my library and with the work there, but that we would also establish a home in New York."
He also explained why she would be a good representative for New York, saying: "She cares so much about the issues, especially those that have a particular impact on New York, including the education and economic issues that would be very important to the people there."
He defended Vice President Gore's recent claim that he "took the initiative in creating the Internet" and his suggestions that he spent a rustic boyhood as a farmhand in Tennessee. He actually grew up in Washington, the son of a Senator.
He "has been for 20 years one of the major architects of America's progress in technology," Mr. Clinton said.
"As far as his boyhood home, I think -- I know what you're saying," Mr. Clinton said. "You're saying, well, he went to St. Alban's and his daddy was a Senator. But it's also true that he is from East Tennessee and he did learn to do all those things he did on the farm."
He brushed aside a question about whether he felt betrayed by books highly critical of him by former advisers George Stephanopoulos and Dick Morris.
"I have absorbed no pain," he said, "since I haven't read either one of the books."

HEADLINE: Harlem Minister Urges Boycott to Protest Racism

BYLINE: By TERRY PRISTIN

 BODY:
A prominent Harlem minister called on African-Americans yesterday to boycott two shopping districts in New York City to demonstrate their economic strength and to protest racism that included "the murderous behavior by police officers who kill unarmed blacks."
Flanked by a racially mixed group of clergy members from several Christian denominations, the minister, the Rev. Calvin O. Butts 3d, pastor of the Abyssinian Baptist Church, told reporters, "Black New Yorkers can no longer freely cooperate with a political economic system that allows the continued assault on the human rights of people of color." 
 Mr. Butts said the campaign would start immediately at two shopping districts heavily patronized by blacks: 34th Street in Manhattan and the Fulton Mall in Brooklyn. He said the boycott would be expanded in two weeks to Kings Plaza in Brooklyn, Fordham Road in the Bronx and Jamaica Avenue in Queens.
City officials said a boycott would only hurt struggling minority-owned businesses just when the city's economy is growing at a faster rate than the national average. "To now try to stop that growth and create some level of unemployment is counterproductive," Deputy Mayor Rudy Washington said. "I'm sorry that it's happening."
Although the boycott is a direct response to the shooting death last month of Amadou Diallo, an unarmed West African immigrant, by four New York City police officers, Mr. Butts said it also carried a broader message about unfair treatment of blacks by hospitals, schools and lending institutions.
At the Fulton Mall yesterday, most shoppers interviewed were unaware of the call for a boycott, and some were skeptical that it could work. "People will not pay attention to it," said Virginia Dotson, 58. "They'll come to where the bargains are."
But David Spell, 49, said he was open to the idea of a boycott. "If Calvin can organize it," he said, "I would follow. There are plenty of alternative places to shop."
Lou Carbonetti, the executive director of the Fulton Mall Improvement Association, a business group, said at least 85 percent of the mall's customers are black. "This is an emotional situation that's taken place against the city," he said. "It's not a personal thing against the mall."
Officials of the 34th Street Partnership, the business group representing the other boycott target, had no comment.
