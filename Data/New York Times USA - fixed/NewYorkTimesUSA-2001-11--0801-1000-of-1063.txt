HEADLINE: Fresh Fighting In Philippines; Death Toll Rises to 100 

BYLINE:  Reuters 

DATELINE: JOLO, the Philippines, Nov. 21 

 BODY:
Fresh fighting broke out on Jolo island today, and the death toll in an uprising by guerrillas loyal to a rebellious Muslim governor rose to more than 100, military officials said. The officials said they had used helicopter gunships and World War II vintage bomber planes to attack guerrilla positions. They also said they had sought the help of Malaysia to keep the governor, Nur Misuari, from escaping there by sea. 
 The navy threatened to sink any boat he tried to use. 
 "As per body count and reports from the field, the enemy suffered fatalities not lower than 100," Lt. Gen. Roy Cimatu, the military commander in the south, said. "We know where their hide-outs are, and airstrikes are continuing."
About 7,000 soldiers hunted the governor's fighters, who attacked an army base and four other targets on Jolo on Monday. Charges of rebellion -- punishable by a maximum 40 years in jail -- are to be filed on Thursday against Mr. Misuari and his followers, officials said.
As the chairman of the Moro National Liberation Front, Mr. Misuari signed a peace accord in 1996 after leading a revolt for an Islamic state in the south of the mainly Roman Catholic Philippines for 24 years.
The military said the front's latest attacks were meant to prevent elections on Monday to pick a successor to Mr. Misuari as governor of the Autonomous Region of Muslim Mindanao. General Cimatu said skirmishes were occurring in Panamao, Patikul and Indanan, mountainous areas on the largely Muslim island.
Military officials said they believed Mr. Misuari was hiding in a village on Jolo, but they were checking reports he might have gone to Sabah, a state in Malaysia. A report from villagers said he had been wounded in the airstrikes, but it was not confirmed, General Cimatu said.
Manila set up the semiautonomous region of four impoverished Muslim provinces and installed Mr. Misuari as governor after the 1996 accord.
President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo's administration has accused him of mismanaging the region. He has said the region has remained poor because Manila has failed to release funds to develop it.
After talks in Washington with President Arroyo, President Bush said on Tuesday that the United States would increase military and economic aid to the Philippines for its fight against Muslim separatists, calling it an extension of the war against terrorism. He said the United States would give nearly $100 million to help the Philippines combat Abu Sayyaf, another Muslim guerrilla group in the southern Philippines.
The local military has accused Mr. Misuari of entering into an alliance with Abu Sayyaf, which has been holding an American missionary couple hostage for nearly six months. Washington has linked the group to Osama bin Laden and his terrorist network, Al Qaeda.

LENGTH: 2863 words

HEADLINE: On the 104th Floor in Two Towers, a Boyfriend and a Brother Are Lost

BYLINE: These sketches were written by Adam Clymer, Sherri Day, Barnaby J. Feder, Constance L. Hays, Jan Hoffman, Dena Kleiman, Barbara Stewart and Yilu Zhao.

 BODY:
Here are glimpses of some of the victims of the Sept. 11 attack on the World Trade Center.

FREDERICK COX
A 'Glutton for Life'
 Climb into that hammock between two trees on an island in Lake Winnepesaukee, N.H. Feel the soft summer stillness. Look up. A tile hanging from one tree reads, ''Do what you love, love what you do.''
 That was Frederick Cox's hammock, his motto, the tile he hung.
 Like his motto, Mr. Cox, 27, was a full-throttle enthusiast brushed by navet.
 Even though he sought the serenity of his family's summer home, he lived a Manhattan life of joyous clatter. Buoyantly confident, with his green eyes glowing with mischief, he made friends easily.
 Who could resist that pied-piper promise of adventure, the courtliness of a Georgia-bred gentleman, the charm of a super salesman?
 Not Annelise Peterson, his girlfriend, who described Mr. Cox, an investment banker at Sandler O'Neill, as a ''glutton for life'' -- a painter, writer, golfer, shopper, food lover. He reminded her of her older brother Davin, a trader for Cantor Fitzgerald. Both were tall, loyal, attentive.
 After Mr. Cox's parents divorced when he was 8, he gave his mother a rose every Valentine's Day. His father, the son said, was his best friend.
 Both Mr. Cox and Davin Peterson, who dined with Ms. Peterson on Sept. 8, worked on the 104th floor at the World Trade Center -- Mr. Peterson in the north tower, Mr. Cox in the south tower.

DAVIN PETERSON
A Gentle Giant
It felt natural to look up to Davin Peterson: he was 6 feet 6 inches tall. But he was also comfortable as a leader and mediator of the four Peterson kids, his mother's stalwart and confidant when the family was cracked by divorce. He was calming, clear-headed, an old soul since childhood, but possessed of an exquisite sensitivity: when one sister was going through a rough time, he wept about it openly at work.
 At 25, he was a trader at Cantor Fitzgerald, although notions of his future were still forming. His travel lust had taken him to Vietnam, China, Scandinavia.
 With a deep interest in human rights, politics and economics, he considered starting a business in an impoverished country.
 Mr. Peterson was also possessed of an antic sense of humor. He cooked anti-Thanksgiving meals -- one year, fajitas, another year, steak.
 He had an elaborate scheme for the secession of his native California, featuring himself as the head of a military coup. And he vowed to leave his life insurance to Rambo, his mother's beloved five-pound Yorkshire terrier.
 Really?
 Ah, got you!
 And whenever he did, Mr. Peterson, enormously pleased with himself, would dance a little jig, a gentle giant with size 16 feet.

RONALD BUCCA
Rescuer and Counselor
Ronald Bucca was nicknamed ''the Flying Fireman'' in 1986 after he fell spectacularly from a tenement fire escape, spun around a cable strung through the backyard and lived to tell the tale. And that was just one of his moments.
 His specialty was rescuing mankind from smoke and flames, but he did not mind scorching certain people with his wit.
 His colleagues collected ''Ron-isms.'' An example: ''This one is as sharp as a basketball.''
 He designed hats for other firemen with details that they found hilarious (but unfortunately, that were not printable).
 A firefighter for 23 years, the last nine as a fire marshal, he was also a nurse and a reservist in the United States Army's Special Forces.
 Mr. Bucca trained as an antiterrorist intelligence expert, and when the planes hit the towers on Sept. 11, he called his wife, Eve, and said he was heading to the scene.
 ''He knew it was a terrorist attack,'' Mrs. Bucca said. ''He had been expecting something like that for a very long time.'' 
 Before that day, his final investigation had involved a young woman who set her former boyfriend's letters on fire and left them to burn in a toilet. He counseled her as a father might.
 ''No guy is worth getting this upset over; don't be too concerned about this guy,'' he told her, said Keith O'Mara, his partner. ''There are a lot of fish in the sea. And if this should ever happen again, think about buying yourself a paper shredder.''

KEVIN DONNELLY
Fun Is the Beach
Fire may have provided Lt. Kevin Donnelly of Ladder Company 3 with his livelihood, but what he loved was water. 
 Born under the hot July sun, he got a job as a lifeguard at the town pool in Wantagh, while still a teenager on Long Island, said his mother, Cecilia. As an adult, he found any excuse to head for the water, even when some other task beckoned.
 ''He kept a bathing suit, a towel and goggles in his car at all times, just in case,'' said his longtime companion, Mary Coughlin, ''and in the summer, he'd add two beach chairs, a towel and a bathing suit for me.'' 
 The two of them might be driving along, on their way to Home Depot or some other store to run errands. And Lieutenant Donnelly, 43, would turn to her, and say: ''You know what? We can do this another time. Let's go to the beach.''
 He was not persnickety about his beaches, though he preferred those on the ocean. He was hoping to become a lifeguard again, on some Long Island strand. North Shore, South Shore. ''He wouldn't have cared what beach he ended up on,'' Ms. Coughlin said, ''as long as it was on the sand and near the water.''

CALIXTO ANAYA JR.
Doing Things Right
Calixto Anaya Jr.'s wife, Marie, remembers the New York City firefighter everyone knew as Charlie as ''very attentive to the little things that keep love alive,'' whether it was taking days off for activities with their three children or showing up with flowers when she did not expect them.
 ''Charlie always wanted to do things the right way,'' Mrs. Anaya said. When they were married in 1990 in a simple civil service, Mr. Anaya insisted that they begin saving for the big church wedding her parents could not afford. Six months later, they marched down the aisle of St. Rita's Roman Catholic Church in Brooklyn.
 Mr. Anaya, a former Marine who re-enlisted when the Persian Gulf War broke out in 1991, believed true patriotism meant flying the American flag, not only in front of their home in Suffern, N.Y., but also wherever the family came to rest on camping trips or jaunts to the beach.
 Mr. Anaya, 35, loved the Yankees in baseball and the Giants in football with similar exuberance. He preserved the hole he punched in his basement ceiling while celebrating the Yankees' World Series victory over the Mets last year.

VIRGINIA M. JABLONSKI
The Early Bird
Virginia M. Jablonski, an assistant vice president at Marsh & McLennan, liked to get up at 5 a.m. and catch an early bus from her home in Matawan, N.J., to her office on the 94th floor of 1 World Trade Center. In recent months, that often meant slipping out while Barry, her husband of 21 years, was enjoying the extra sleep made possible by his recent retirement from Lucent Technologies.
 Fortunately, Mr. Jablonski is an astronomy buff. Having noted that the International Space Station was scheduled to pass directly overhead shortly before sunrise on Sept. 11, he got up with her that morning. He recalls their standing in their garden, marveling at the stars in the clear sky and sharing the feeling that it would be a good day.
 ''She was a bubbly person who was always smiling,'' Mr. Jablonski said. ''Most people wouldn't know if she was angry.''
 No one could miss her passion for cats, though. Mrs. Jablonski, a 49-year-old Brooklyn native, filled their home with cat-themed decorations and doted on her two feline companions, Fred and Bill.

MICHAEL A. TRINIDAD
Staying Friends
When Michael A. Trinidad and Monique Ferrer divorced three years ago, they stayed friends. Ms. Ferrer got the custody of their two children, Thea, then 7, and Timothy, then 6, and it was understood that the children were ''theirs'' -- not ''his'' or ''hers.''
 Every other Friday, Mr. Trinidad would come to pick up the children for the weekend. ''He was like a big kid,'' Ms. Ferrer said. ''He would take them to the park, play ball games, call them silly names and just act silly.'' The three also went apple picking in upstate New York and sun-bathing on the Jersey Shore.
 After the first plane hit the trade center on Sept. 11, Mr. Trinidad, 33, who was working in telecommunications accounting for Cantor Fitzgerald, called Ms. Ferrer to say goodbye. '' 'What goodbye?' I asked him. 'Are you going anywhere?' '' Ms. Ferrer recalled asking him, unaware of the disaster.
 '' 'I love you, and I love the kids,' he said. 'I am not going to make it out.' Then he asked to talk to my husband,'' Ms. Ferrer said. ''Michael asked my husband to be his children's father and love them for him.''

SIEW-NYA ANG
Missing Mommy
It has been at least eight years since Siew-Nya Ang saw an R-rated movie. Ms. Ang relished family time and since her daughters Jeanee, 8, and Winnee, 4, were too young for movies with grown-up themes, she only watched family-oriented films.
 Ms. Ang, 37, also discouraged her husband, Kui-Liong Lee, from doing yardwork when he could be spending time with the family. ''She would say: 'Wake up early in the morning. You can mow the lawn when we're asleep,' '' Mr. Lee said. 
 On weekdays, Ms. Ang left for her job as a technical analyst at Marsh USA while her family was sleeping. But every morning around 8, she called home to make sure her girls were properly equipped to handle a day of school and dance, piano, ice skating or gymnastics lessons.
 Since Sept. 11, the girls say good night to a picture of Ms. Ang, which hangs on the bedroom wall. Some nights, they complain to it, too. ''Sometimes I have to let them know that Mommy is in heaven and other than that I just don't know what to say,'' Mr. Lee said. ''Sometimes if they say 'I want mommy,' I can't do anything.''

ANTHONY STARITA
Relaxing With a Cigar
Cigars were a necessary accessory for Anthony Starita. He had one in his mouth when he went to beach, when he puttered around his backyard in Westfield, N.J., and when he relaxed on his deck every night after dinner. ''He liked the flavor,'' said his wife, Diane Starita. ''He didn't always actually smoke them, but he would just have one in his mouth to sort of chew on.''
 Mr. Starita, 35, also chewed on coffee straws, mostly when he got nervous about a deal at his job as a government bond trader at Cantor Fitzgerald. ''When he got a little nervous he put the straws in his mouth and he would start wiping his hands with napkins,'' said Eddie De Castro, Mr. Starita's longtime friend and former trading partner. ''Those were his two things.''
 Last year, Mr. Starita gave up his full-time golf membership at a country club so that he could spend more time with his wife and two children, Kaila, 6, and Jason, 3.
 After the terrorist attacks, Mrs. Starita told the children that their father had gone to heaven. Kaila wondered why ''does he have to be with God?'' Mrs. Starita said. ''My 3-year-old wanted to know if we could call Daddy in heaven.''

MARGARET CONNER
Sailing Toward Renewal
When Margaret Conner wanted to escape the chaos of everyday life, she fled her home in Bay Ridge, Brooklyn, and headed for her daughter's boat on Candlewood Lake in Brookfield, Conn. It did not matter that Mrs. Conner was prone to seasickness and could not swim. Sailing on the lake brought her peace and tranquillity. 
 Back home, Mrs. Conner, 57, was the gatekeeper at Cantor Fitzgerald, a receptionist who was the first person people saw when they got off the elevator on the 103rd Floor of 1 World Trade Center. For many young women at the office, she was a relationship therapist.
 ''She was just very open and very eager to be there for anyone,'' said her daughter, Corrine Bounty.
 Mrs. Conner and her husband, Frank Conner, were married for 13 years and spent nearly every moment of their free time together, often frequenting Broadway plays and dining out. Every day they recorded and watched Mrs. Conner's favorite soap opera, ''The Young and the Restless.''
 Mrs. Conner was also committed to her daily Bible study. On Sept. 11 her study passage was about the healing and renewal of God. 
 ''I read this passage the next day and was furious with God,'' Mr. Conner said. ''After rereading the passage, I realized that God had fulfilled his message to her. She is now in a place where His ever-renewing life is coursing throughout her body.''

JANE JOSIAH
Have Friends, Will Travel
Last year, Jane Josiah began a series of visits to far-flung family and friends that did not end for nearly a year. She did not begin looking for work after being laid off last winter. Instead she flew from Texas, where she had moved seven years earlier, to Seattle to see her brother and sister-in-law. 
 Soon after, she went to Washington for a few weeks with Jennifer and Kelly, her daughters. Then she stayed with friends in Philadelphia and Long Island.
 Ms. Josiah, 47, had a gift for making friends, loving them and kicking up her heels with them, said Debra Potash, who knew her 20 years. 
 The visiting culminated with Ms. Josiah's 30th high school reunion in Levittown, on Long Island, where old friends persuaded her to come home. After one found her a job at Fiduciary Trust, she drove north to Mrs. Potash's home on Long Island. Her first day was Aug. 27.
 All the traveling had made Ms. Josiah's daughters a bit impatient. ''It was supposed to be a month,'' Jennifer said. ''Then two months. Then four.''
 Now, she said, the months her mother spent with the people she loved seem like an unmatchable gift.

MARK BAVIS
Scouting Hockey Talent
Mark Bavis, a hockey scout, was on his way to work on Sept. 11, flying west for the Los Angeles Kings training camp, where he would be checking on the progress of players the team had drafted on his advice. He took United Airlines Flight 175 from Boston.
 Mr. Bavis, 32, had starred for the Boston University Terriers from 1990 to 1993. He was ''a great defensive forward and a real smart playmaker,'' said his coach, Jack Parker.
 The coach used Mark and his twin brother, Mike, as a team to kill penalties. ''The Bavi, we called them,'' Mr. Parker said. ''They were always together.''
 Mike Bavis, an assistant to Mr. Parker, agreed. ''We were very close,'' he said. ''But we were competitive.''
 The scouting job, after a few years in minor league hockey and turns as assistant coach at Brown and Harvard, delighted his brother because of the travel it involved. ''He really enjoyed some of the finer places in our country and loved to have a good time,'' his brother said.

RALPH GERHARDT
A Dream Fulfilled
He delighted in bungee jumping and feeding sharks. At 6 feet 2 inches tall, Ralph Gerhardt enjoyed playing the part of daredevil and strong man. He had an impish sense of humor and a reputation for practical jokes.
 Still, he was an affectionate son, who called his parents in Toronto every day. 
 He had grown up in Toronto, the son of German immigrants, but New York had always been his dream.
 And so last February -- when Mr. Gerhardt, a 34-year-old bond trader, was transferred by Cantor Fitzgerald to the 105th floor of the World Trade Center -- was one of the happiest times of his life. 
 He was eager to show his parents that life -- ''my New York'' as he was so proud to call it.
 His parents came often to visit so he could show them the apartment he was fixing up on Lexington Avenue and 26th Street, the bicycle he liked to ride over to Central Park, the woman from Staten Island he had met at work, the many museums and monuments he prided himself on knowing, as well as the best tour guides.
 ''It was the pinnacle,'' said his father, Hans Gerhardt, who last heard from his son at 8:48 a.m., moments after the plane hit. ''He said: 'Something just happened. I am O.K. We are evacuating. I will call you later.' ''

FLORENCE M. GREGORY
The Stylings of Disco Flo
Seated in what she thought was too formal a restaurant last winter at Christmas, Florence M. Gregory announced to companions that she was going outside to ask the Salvation Army band on the corner if they knew a certain song. Moments later, the band arrived at the restaurant, took the table next to hers, and played songs for everyone.
 ''That was my sister,'' Maureen Petronis said. ''She could break the ice anywhere.''
 Miss Gregory, who was known as ''Disco Flo'' because of her taste in music, loved people. ''She was always smiling and laughing and joking,'' Mrs. Petronis said. ''People were drawn to her.''
 When she was not working at Aon, where she was a specialist in marine insurance, Miss Gregory, 38, could be found golfing, fishing, cooking, traveling and spending time with her two nieces and three nephews. A longtime resident of Breezy Point in Queens, she was one of three children of Florence and John Gregory.
 She was an excellent cook and took particular pleasure in preparing meals for family and friends. Her favorite holiday was St. Patrick's Day, when she would pull out all the stops with corned beef and cabbage.
 ''She was a fabulous aunt,'' Mrs. Petronis said.

The Confirmed Dead
 Following is the name of the person most recently confirmed to have died in the World Trade Center disaster, according to the New York City medical examiner's office, which said the victim's family had been notified.

HEADLINE: AT THE MOVIES 

BYLINE:  By Dave Kehr 

 BODY:
Trading Britain For America
 Tom Wilkinson's face, along with some of his other parts, is probably best known to American audiences from the film "The Full Monty," in which he played an unemployed foreman in an English steel factory who joins five of his buddies in a troupe of male strippers. 
 That primary identification is likely to change as of today with the release of "In the Bedroom," a somber domestic drama that gives Mr. Wilkinson his first leading role in an American movie (review, Page 25). In the film, directed by Todd Field from a short story by Andre Dubus, Mr. Wilkinson and Sissy Spacek play the New England parents of a college-age son (Nick Stahl) who is involved with an older woman (Marisa Tomei). Tragedy strikes, and with it, Mr. Wilkinson and Ms. Spacek achieve some stunning moments of actorly intensity. 
"I thought it would be good for me to do," Mr. Wilkinson said of his trans-Atlantic venture. "I read it and I thought, this is a wonderful piece. It's intelligent; it's got a beginning, a middle and an end. It fits together, and it's got certain resonances which are only now clear to me, having seen the movie. Of course, a script is merely a blueprint; it's not the finished article. So I thought it would be good for me to do, just from the simple level of it'd be good to play an American, it would be good to be a lead in an American movie, it would be good to work with Sissy."
For Mr. Wilkinson, "the tradition of English screen acting is, on the whole, versatility," he said. "John Mills, who is a fantastic actor, could do anything. He could play good guys, bad guys, weaklings, strong guys, working-class characters, upper-class characters. He could do anything he wanted to. I wouldn't put it as that strictly technical mastery. And I worked with John Gielgud, and he wasn't technically very accomplished. I mean, he had a wonderful voice, but that came from a profound understanding of what it was that he was saying. He believed in the text."
Mr. Wilkinson learned his trade at Britain's National Theater and the Royal Shakespeare Company, but he finds his continuing inspiration closer to home. "I think the clue to how I work is that I like watching children play," Mr. Wilkinson said. "I've watched my daughters -- I mean, they're older now, they're 13 and 10 -- but watching them during their heyday of play, which is about when they're 8 and perhaps a little bit younger than that, you see how they can immediately step into the reality of the game that they've set up and, quite unself-consciously, improvise endlessly.
"I've still got that," Mr. Wilkinson concluded. "I've retained it."

That Magic Touch
So now that "Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone" is old news, what's up with David Heyman, the young British producer who presciently acquired the rights to J. K. Rowling's novel before it was published?
"We've been shooting the next film for three weeks already, doing second-unit work on Harry and the flying car for 'Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,' " Mr. Heyman said during a visit to New York last week. "The full-fledged principal photography begins on Monday."
The Monday in question was Nov. 19, the day after "Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone" opened over a record-breaking $93.5 million weekend. This is a new world for the soft-spoken Mr. Heyman, who worked for many years in the United States, producing action films like "Juice" and "Blind Justice" before returning to England and opening his own production company.
"I wanted to go home after being away for 17 years," he said. "And I decided to acquire some books, as a way of getting in business with people I might not otherwise be able to get in business with. People in my office knew I was looking for children's books, so Nisha Parti, my secretary, took 'Harry' home for the weekend and came in Monday morning and said: 'I read this book. I'm not sure about it, but there's something in it I quite like.' I took it home that night, began reading and read the whole book. I fell madly in love with it."
"It was about so many things -- themes of loyalty and friendship and family, about belonging and finding a family at Hogwarts that Harry had never had," Mr. Heyman said. "I thought it was really a universal piece." He optioned the rights to the first novel and has a deal to film the subsequent books in the series.
"I knew it was something special, but I would be lying if I said I knew what would happen," Mr. Heyman said. "I thought I was making a small- or medium-budgeted film, but as the book reached No. 1 on the New York Times best-seller list, I knew we were on to something. Then books one and two became one and two on the best-seller list, and then when we had one, two and three on the list, that's when I really knew that it was something that had stepped beyond what I had dreamed."
The film of "Sorcerer's Stone," directed by Chris Columbus and written by Steve Kloves, has been faulted by some critics, including Elvis Mitchell of The New York Times, for staying too close to the source material, and by some audience members -- the young, hard-core Harry fans -- for not staying close enough. "It was a conscious decision to be as faithful to the book as possible," Mr. Heyman said. "The challenge was to condense what could have been a six- or seven-hour film, if it had had all the details down, to a manageable script."
"We were damned if we did and damned if we didn't," Mr. Heyman said, "but in the end, I think we would have got more criticism for departing from the book. More people would have been disgruntled if we had departed from the books than would have been disgruntled if we were too faithful."

An Editor's Education
Six Oscar-nominated film editors, including Tim Squyres ("Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"), Carol Littleton ("E.T."), Craig McKay ("The Silence of the Lambs"), Andrew Mondshein ("The Sixth Sense"), Alan Heim ("Lenny") and the venerated Dede Allen ("Bonnie and Clyde," "Dog Day Afternoon") have been enlisted by the American Museum of the Moving Image in Queens for the inaugural program in a new master class series. Each Saturday and Sunday afternoon from Dec. 1 to Dec. 16, a different editor will be present for a screening of a representative film and an extended discussion. Also scheduled are master class series devoted to other crafts, including sound, special effects and cinematography. Information: (718) 784-0077 or www.ammi.org.

Officials Predict Upturn in Unstable South Korean Economy

BYLINE:  By DON KIRK 

DATELINE: SEOUL, South Korea, Nov. 22 

 BODY:
The volatile South Korean economy is perking up, new forecasts showed today, just as pessimists were predicting a prolonged slump aggravated by the worldwide economic downturn after the terrorist attacks in the United States.
 The country's two most influential economic officials both forecast significant economic growth next year, while the Bank of Korea said that gross domestic product for the third quarter was 1.8 percent higher than in the period a year earlier. 
 The Bank of Korea governor, Chon Chol Hwan, and the finance minister, Jin Nyum, predicted that the economy would grow by 4 percent next year amid slow recovery from this year's relatively stagnant performance. The economy for the year, according to the central bank and the finance ministry, is likely to grow 2.5 percent. 
Mr. Jin said, however, that the government would not be able to balance the budget for at least another year while battling to ensure that economic measures put in place in recent months would have more than a short-term effect.
Instead, Mr. Jin told business leaders, "it will be beneficial to allow the budget to play a role in helping expedite economic recovery rather than sticking to the original target of achieving a balanced budget in 2003." Optimism about the economy was generated by the realization that growth in the third quarter was higher than expected.
Third-quarter growth, Mr. Jin said, "was driven mostly by increases in construction and services due to government measures." The most important has been a $5 billion public works program highlighted by road and railroad building to shore up the sagging construction industry, a bulwark of economic growth ever since the Korean War.
The growth in the third quarter compared with an increase of 1.2 percent in the second quarter, when the country appeared in danger of a slump reminiscent of the economic crisis that swept the nation and the region in 1997 and 1998. The economy shrank 6.7 percent in 1998, its worst year in more than a decade, before rebounding in 1999, when it grew by 10.2 percent.
Amid signs of slipping, the economy still managed to grow by more than 8 percent last year before a reversal that played a role in the falling popularity of President Kim Dae Jung. Mr. Kim's opponents have frequently accused him of spending too much time pursuing reconciliation with North Korea while glossing over his own country's problems. 
Today, however, Mr. Kim's economic team defied the critics despite concerns about declining exports and the gloomy prospects for the electronics industry, one of the mainstays of the economy.
Chung Jung Jo, a director of the Bank of Korea, cited "strong domestic demand and construction" as "the pillars that propelled growth in the third quarter." He predicted still greater growth in the fourth quarter and full recovery by the middle of next year, in parallel with recovery in the United States.
The upturn in the economy has paralleled a surge in the stock market, which has risen more than 30 percent over the last two months, closing at 624.56 today, after having dipped below 500 earlier this year.

HEADLINE: 'Made in America,' and Never Mind the Gas Mileage 

BYLINE:  By NEELA BANERJEE 

 BODY:
Andrew Serkanic has been a patriot since he was 7 -- "from the first time I saw the flag," he said.
 Not that the other parents picking up their grade-schoolers at the Pines Lake School in Wayne, N.J., could doubt it. Mr. Serkanic's choices in apparel sometimes include T-shirts with Osama bin Laden's face surrounded by the words "Wanted Dead or Alive." Mr. Serkanic's business is God Bless America Meats, and he says that Kate Smith sings on the company's answering machine. And then there is his car, part ornate chariot and all political megaphone: a white Ford Explorer with gold trim, its tailgate and tinted windows emblazoned with the flag and "God Bless America." 
 "It gets 12.8 miles per gallon that I love to pay for," Mr. Serkanic said, beaming. "It's made in America, or at least half of it anyway." 
For Mr. Serkanic and many others like him in this part of North Jersey, there is no contradiction between patriotism and driving a gas guzzler. Some talk-show commentators and op-ed page writers may be connecting the dots between oil and terrorism, but few people in this area seem to have heard the idea -- and fewer still believe -- that individual Americans, by buying more fuel-efficient vehicles, can make the United States less dependent on Middle Eastern countries and others that so many of them now rage against. 
And they give little credence to the notion that the United States has earned the enmity of many Arabs and Muslims because it refrains from criticizing the corruption and human rights violations in oil-producing countries. 
"In my simple mind, this has nothing to do with oil," Mr. Serkanic said.
Indeed, there is less these days to remind Americans about the relationship between their gasoline use and global politics than at times in the past when war or the threat of war roiled the Middle East. 
The retail price of gasoline in the United States has been falling, after a steeper drop in the commodity price of crude oil. And with the Big Three automakers offering zero-percent financing on many purchases, car dealers around Wayne, like their counterparts nationwide, have been selling record numbers of sport utility vehicles and other light trucks. The country's best-selling vehicles last month -- Ford's F-Series trucks, the Chevrolet Silverado and the Ford Explorer -- on average get about 16 miles to the gallon, according to government figures. 
"Gas mileage concerns haven't been slowing sales down," said Robert Singh, sales manager at Fette Ford, on Route 46 in Clifton. "We've been selling S.U.V.'s like crazy."
At the Costco parking lot down the road, Cindy Goldstein acknowledged, laughing a bit abashedly, that her six-year-old Land Rover devours gasoline, and then she pondered where that fuel came from. "I don't know how we get it from the Middle East," she said recently, the American flag on her sport utility vehicle fluttering in the breeze like others in the lot. "I think there's some oil in Texas."
Once she heard the concept of how American dependence on oil may in a variety of ways help nurture terrorism, her laughter died off. "I never thought of it that way," Mrs. Goldstein said -- "that we should be conserving more."
Sue Smith had already heard the theories, and she dismissed them entirely. "I don't think it's unpatriotic to use so much gas," Ms. Smith said, loading her silver Chevy Tahoe with groceries. "It's very patriotic. It's our way of life."
And what of the consideration that the American way of life means that a country with less than 5 percent of the world's population uses 25 percent of the world's crude oil? "Why should we cut back?" Ms. Smith, 40, asked. "We're an affluent society. Should I hate my neighbor because she has a better house, a better car, more money?" 
Though a smaller percentage of United States oil imports come from the Persian Gulf region than 30 years ago, the nation imports more of its oil than it ever has, leaving it vulnerable to sharp swings in prices.
For Ms. Smith and many others here, the answer to that vulnerability is not reducing demand or developing alternative fuels, but drilling at home. (Few people realize that the United States has only 3 percent of the world's proven oil reserves.) "We should go on living the way we're living," Ms. Smith said. "And we should think about the wacko environmental groups that are forcing us to get oil someplace else."
In the gathering twilight, at the park-and-ride lot on Route 46, Robert Boesch, 64, a textile designer, walks to his Chevrolet Blazer after returning on the bus from work in New York. Mr. Boesch is aware of how dependent the United States is on foreign oil, but he has no plans to change his driving habits or to stop leasing sport utility vehicles, as he has for eight years. 
"We don't have an alternative right now," Mr. Boesch maintained, "and I don't see our government jumping to the fore on this issue."
That may change. Senate Democrats are drafting an energy bill that would call for increasing the fuel economy of sport utility vehicles and other light trucks; the Ford Motor Company has pledged a 25 percent improvement in the fuel efficiency of its sport utility vehicles by 2005, and both General Motors and Chrysler have promised to match Ford. 
S.U.V. owners, especially women, say they picked their vehicles because they make them feel safer. But when pushed a bit, most say that they simply love being in huge vehicles that make them feel powerful on the road. 
Sheila King, 27, a teacher from Clifton, came one evening to look at what she called "a big monster" sport utility at the McGuire Auto Group on Route 46 in neighboring Little Falls. "It's as much about road rage as anything else," Ms. King said. "You don't want others to do more damage to you than you can do to them."
Ryan McGuire, the dealership's general manager, was not enthusiastic about having a reporter discuss gasoline mileage with his customers. "Because that will get them thinking about it," he said, "and we don't want that."
But relatively few people in this area seem to be thinking about gas mileage, and the circumstances that would prompt Americans to opt for more fuel-efficient vehicles have not yet shaken the country.
"What would get people to stop driving S.U.V.'s?" Ms. Smith said earlier in the day. "If God came down from heaven and said, 'You can't drive S.U.V.'s anymore.' "

HEADLINE: Europe Stocks Rise, Nudged by Oil and Telecommunications 

BYLINE:  Agence France-Presse 

DATELINE: LONDON, Nov. 22 

 BODY:
European share prices inched up today, propelled by telecommunications and oil companies in tepid trading reflecting the closure of Wall Street for Thanksgiving Day.
 In the 12-nation euro zone the Euro Stoxx-50 index was up 1.07 percent, to 3,769.9. 
 In London, the FTSE-100 index gained 32.1 points, or 0.61 percent, to 5,345.9. 
The CAC 40 index in Paris also finished stronger, adding 0.96 percent, to reach 4,599.80 points, while in Frankfurt the DAX index gained 0.74 percent, to finish at 5,124.54.
Investors on the London exchange appeared unmoved by third-quarter data showing that the British economy expanded at a rate of 0.5 percent compared with the similar period in 2000 and was up 2.1 percent for the year.
The results were slightly weaker than initial estimates for the quarter.
The market was sustained by telecommunications and later in the day by the petroleum sector after an announcement by Norway that it was prepared to trim production by up to 200,000 barrels a day if other crude producers did likewise.
BP rose 2.1 percent, or 11 pence, to 535.5 while Royal Dutch/Shell gained 0.91 percent, or 4.5 pence, to reach 497.
Among telecommuncations issues, Vodafone added 1.8 percent, or 3.35 pence, to finish at 184.5. Cable and Wireless was also up 2.03 percent, or 8 pence, to 357.
In Paris, technology and telecommunications were the star performers. France Telecom bounced back from a loss on Wednesday to gain 2.37 percent to end the session at 46.60 euros.
Cap Gemini rose 2.77 percent, to 76 euros while Vivendi Universal gained 2.34 percent to finish at 59 euros.
In Frankfurt, investors were confronted with contrasting pictures of the German economy. While growth turned slightly negative in the third quarter, inflation was reported to be well in check.
Trading on Asia's major stock exchanges was cautious, with sentiment affected by holidays in the United States and Japan.
Among the region's main indexes, Tokyo, Hong Kong and Seoul made gains while Sydney, Singapore and Taipei fell in mostly lackluster trading with investors sidelined amid the holidays. Tokyo will be closed for its own public holiday Friday.
The Nikkei average of 225 leading issues on the Tokyo Stock Exchange closed up 35.74 points, or 0.3 percent, to 10,696.82.
Hong Kong stocks rose 0.7 percent on the back of technical gains in China Mobile and China Unicom, but sentiment was also cautious.
The Hang Seng index gained 79.38 points, to 11,253.30.
Ross Cheung, an analyst with Tanrich Securities, said market turnover dropped substantially as many investors were sidelined ahead of the American holiday.
Bolstered by a technical rebound, China Mobile and China Unicom provided the major support to the Hang Seng index, dealers said. The two mainland mobile operators had dropped substantially over the last two days on concerns over the possible entry of a third mobile phone operator in the mainland market.
The Australian market fell 0.3 percent, with the All Ordinaries index down 10.1 points to 3,262.40, while the SP/ASX 200 dropped 12.1 points, to 3,324.20.
Singapore share prices closed 1 percent lower.

Thai Oil Stock Offering Is Much in Demand

BYLINE:  By WAYNE ARNOLD 

DATELINE: SINGAPORE, Nov. 22 

 BODY:
Despite analysts' expectations, foreign interest is strong in the initial public offering of Thailand's oil and gas company, reviving hopes that the country's long-stalled privatization program is back on track and that investors may be returning to Southeast Asia.
 On Wednesday, Thailand sold about one-third of the state oil and gas company PTT, raising 32.2 billion baht, or about $725 million. Analysts had expected that foreign investors would give PTT a wide berth, but orders from abroad far exceeded the shares PTT had allotted for foreigners. When the stock begins trading on the Bangkok exchange on Dec. 6, investors from Europe, the United States and elsewhere in Asia will own 12 percent of PTT, one of Thailand's largest companies. 
 For the better part of two years, investors have shied away from the Southeast Asian region, deeming it risky because of political instability and the sluggish pace of economic change. The global slowdown has worsened the trend.
But evidence is mounting that foreign investors are slowly regaining their appetite for bargains in emerging markets as uncertain results on their home markets leave them seeking higher returns elsewhere.
"Two percent just doesn't cut it when you're used to 10," said Deborah Schuler, senior analyst at Moody's Asia Pacific in Singapore. "You're willing to take more risk to get more return." That is welcome news for Southeast Asian governments, which plan to sell more assets as they try to spend their way out of an economic slowdown that has crippled exports.
Privatization in Thailand was part of the terms of a $17 billion bailout by the International Monetary Fund in the Asian financial crisis that began in 1997. Economists and the I.M.F. have urged such sales in countries like Thailand, Indonesia and the Philippines as a way to invigorate private business, rekindle investor interest and replenish government funds.
Thaksin Shinawatra, the telecommunications tycoon who became prime minister in February, has pledged to push privatization forward to reduce the government's debt and budget deficit. But as share sales failed to materialize and antiforeign measures proliferated, foreign investors came to question Mr. Thaksin's sincerity. Some said that Thailand, like Indonesia, was giving in to nationalism and vested interests that opposed selling stakes to foreigners at a discount.
Last month, for example, the Thais enacted a law limiting foreign shareholdings in their telecommunications companies to 25 percent. So far this year, foreign investors have pulled 2.75 billion baht, or $61.9 million, out of the Thai stock market.
Though PTT's offering price was far below what the government had hoped for, the sale could represent a turning point, analysts said. "It shows that they're serious about their privatization program," said Kenneth Ng of ING Barings in Bangkok, "and that they're not fiddling around just because the price isn't there."
To be sure, the latest foreign investment is a trickle compared with the flood of money into the region before the financial crisis. And foreigners so far seem to be selecting only the most conservative investments.
Part of their return is based on world politics. Southeast Asia is home to a large part of the world's Muslims. Some investors are betting that recent pledges of aid from Washington to Indonesia and the Philippines are signs that President Bush is unwilling to allow economic instability to feed anti-American religious sentiment.
And with interest rates worldwide generally lower, international investors are searching for higher returns. That, analysts say, has helped drive up prices in recent weeks for dollar-denominated Southeast Asian government bonds, which offer relatively higher yields as well as the region's lowest risk. Government-linked companies are also benefiting from the trend. Singapore Telecommunications and Singapore Airlines, both of which list the government among their largest shareholders, were able to sell more than $2.8 billion in bonds this month amid foreign interest that took underwriters by surprise.
Similarly, bankers say, demand has proved strong for Indonesia's stake in one of its largest banks, Bank Central Asia. Largely relieved by the government of the bad debts that plague many Southeast Asian banks, Bank Central Asia now earns money not from lending but by using its low-interest-bearing deposits to invest in higher-yielding government bonds. Its stock, therefore, is the next best thing to a government-guaranteed bond, bankers say.
Not all foreign fund managers are ready to jump back into Southeast Asia.
"They still have severe corporate governance problems," said J. Mark Mobius, president of the Templeton Emerging Markets Fund. Templeton chose not to invest in PTT's stock offering, he said.
So did OUB Asset Management of Singapore, according to William Cheng, a fund manager. Even after the share sale, Mr. Cheng said, PTT remains heavily indebted and faces potential problems at several subsidiaries. "The internal capital allocations are still a little bit murky to us," he said, "and the Thai government has strong interference into the company's management."
PTT said its executives had allayed concerns among foreign buyers about transparency and the role of the government, which still owns about two-thirds of the company.
To some investors, PTT also presented a conservative move into stocks. The company, which changed its name in September from the Petroleum Authority of Thailand, said it would use part of the share sale proceeds to repay its debt.
PTT also has a secure source of profits: along with oil exploration, petrochemicals and retail fuel sales, it has a monopoly on the transmission of natural gas, Thailand's largest source of fuel for electricity. Most of its gas contracts lock in profits for up to 30 years.
PTT's shares were also priced to move, analysts said. At 35 baht, PTT shares offer a dividend yield of 6 percent, making them more lucrative now than interest on Thai bank deposits.
That, the analysts said, helped explain why local investors lined up for hours last week to apply for shares. Analysts say slumping Asian stock prices have turned up similarly high dividend yields that are likely to attract domestic savers seeking better returns.

German Economy Shrinks, Edging Closer to Recession
Germany moved closer to a recession, and may already be in one, because new statistics show that its economy, Europe's biggest, contracted slightly in the third quarter.
 Though the contraction was only 0.1 percent, it was worse than German officials had predicted, and the news is already sending out shock waves across the rest of Europe. While Germany's economy was officially flat in the second quarter, it actually declined 0.03 percent. A recession is usually defined as at least two quarters in which the national output of goods and services contracts. Page C2. 

South Korea's economy is perking up, new forecasts showed, just as pessimists were predicting a prolonged slump. C2.

Drug Venture Using Cows Hits Snag
On a farm near Madison, Wis., are cows that have been genetically engineered to produce pharmaceuticals in their milk. Some biotechnology executives think such animals may be the pharmaceutical factories of the future. But the cows face an uncertain fate because the company that created them, Pharming Group, has filed for protection from creditors. C5.

Crude Oil Rises on Potential Cuts
Crude oil jumped more than 6 percent and neared $20 a barrel after Norway said that it would cut output and Russian oil executives signaled that they would also lower supply if ordered to by the government. C3.

ABB Chairman Hints at Revamping
A day after the chairman of ABB, Europe's largest electrical engineering group, resigned unexpectedly, his successor, Jurgen Dormann, acknowledged that the company had lost "the credibility of the market" after a series of reorganizations failed to prevent a drastic slide in its share price or produce profits. Mr. Dormann also urged a review of the company's activities to "focus on a smaller number of businesses and make them grow." C2.

HEADLINE: Since Attack, More Landlord-Tenant Clashes Downtown 

BYLINE:  By SUSAN SAULNY 

 BODY:
Tensions between landlords and tenants of buildings close to ground zero in downtown Manhattan have led to more rent strikes and threatened evictions in the last week, with several cases to go to mediation in Housing Court over the next month.
 Angered by what they say are lagging cleanup efforts and inadequate rent reductions and rent credits after the Sept. 11 terrorist attack on the World Trade Center, hundreds of tenants have organized themselves and decided to withhold rent from landlords. 
 "You have to understand the level of upset here," said Sudhir Jain, an information technology consultant and representative for his fellow tenants at 50 Battery Place, where he said about 60 of 200 tenants are withholding rent. "We've all gone through a traumatic event. Now to go through the court system with legal proceedings -- it's adding another layer to everything that's happened and it's like a slap in the face." 
The first case to go to Housing Court mediation will deal with apartment buildings at 32 Pearl Street and 88 Greenwich Street. Some tenants in each building have been withholding rent for two months, said their lawyer, Jack Lester. The case is scheduled to be heard on Thursday. 
Housing Court mediations are not binding, "but the emphasis is to resolve disputes," Mr. Lester said. "From a practical standpoint, the fact that we have a mediation conference scheduled may set a framework for settlement, which may obviate the need for litigation in other buildings." 
Tenants' complaints focus on cleanup and air quality as well as transportation and shopping difficulties since the attack. 
The tenants who have organized themselves at 32 Pearl Street are typical of unsatisfied tenants downtown. They say they want to be compensated for hardships that resulted from the Sept. 11 attack or have the option to leave without penalty. 
The landlords of 32 Pearl Street have offered a 10 percent rent reduction for the term of the lease. They also offered tenants with medical concerns or children under 19 the option of breaking a lease on 30 days' notice without penalty. Everyone else is required to give 60 days' notice and would have to forfeit their security deposit, said Richard Breton, one of the owners of 32 Pearl Street.
"We're struggling to deal ethically and humanely with our tenants, but we're constrained by the economic factors of operating our buildings," Mr. Breton said. "We're trying to help the tenants and work with them, but they can't expect landlords to provide 100 percent of the relief they seek. We know they're suffering and feel depressed." 
Katherine Mogg, president of the tenants' association at 32 Pearl Street, said about 60 percent of the tenants in the 21-unit building are on a rent strike. (Most of the units are two-bedroom apartments and rents average $3,200.) 
"We're dealing with fairly major adjustments to our lifestyle," Ms. Mogg said, citing the dearth of transportation and shopping options. "The landlords' response was quite disappointing." 
Ms. Mogg said that for weeks after Sept. 11 the tenants found it impossible to communicate with the building's management. Eventually, they organized and wrote the landlords a letter outlining their complaints about failures to clean up and monitor air quality, and the absence of rent credits and reductions.
From the landlords' point of view, the tenants' letter was a "laundry list of demands" about a building that is a quarter-mile from the disaster site, and one not badly damaged in the attacks. 
"We've been one of the least affected buildings," Mr. Breton said. "We didn't lose utilities or phone service and were not required to close by any government office." He said he was surprised that the tenants rejected his offer and decided to go on a rent strike.
The level of discontent and disagreement between landlords and tenants seems to be spreading. The number of buildings where tenants are staging rent strikes has grown from two in Battery Park City to at least seven in downtown neighborhoods. 
At 88 Greenwich Street, the tenants' association president, Kate Webber-Pitcock, said the building was "full of people who've never not paid a bill in their lives, and who are loath to withhold money." She added, "It is symbolic of how difficult it is to live here that these people would do something like this." 
But landlords say they are struggling just to pay operating costs and other expenses, which have not declined since Sept. 11.
"We would like to reach an amicable settlement with our tenants," said Kevin Singleton, the senior vice president of Rockrose Development, which owns two buildings in Battery Park City where tenants are withholding rent. "But their demands in our view have to be consistent with the marketplace." 
Mr. Lester said he was optimistic because he believed that the Housing Court hearings offer "an excellent opportunity to mediate settlements." 
Mr. Lester said he hoped that a framework would come out of the proceedings that would create a precedent for other tenants living near ground zero.

HEADLINE: Survey of Small Businesses Finds Outlook Gloomy 

BYLINE:  By The New York Times 

DATELINE: TRENTON, Nov. 22 

 BODY:
Owners of small businesses in New Jersey are more pessimistic about their prospects for the coming year than they have been in any year since the early 1990's, according to survey results by the New Jersey Business and Industry Association. But their gloom is not nearly as deep as it was a decade ago.
 About two-thirds of the 1,600 small-business owners who participated in the association's 43rd annual Business Outlook Survey said their industries had entered a recession or were heading into one, twice as many as said so last year. According to results released this week, almost half of those surveyed said they expected New Jersey's economy to worsen in the first half of 2002, twice as many as those who said last year that they expected a weaker economy at the beginning of 2001. 
 Joe Gonzalez, the association's president, said owners' collective projections for sales, profits and employment had reached their lowest levels since New Jersey emerged from the recession of the early 90's.
Still, he said, things do not appear as bleak as they were back then.
"The pessimism expressed in our survey can at best be characterized as moderate," Mr. Gonzalez said. "Even though these are not good times, in comparison with the early 90's, these are golden days."
Eighty-three percent of those who responded to the survey in 1990 said they thought New Jersey's economy would weaken in the first half of 1991, twice as many as those who said this year that they expected a worse economy. And 62 percent in 1990 said they thought their own industries would weaken, compared with 33 percent this year.
The association sent the survey to its 17,000 members on Sept. 5 and tabulated its results from the first 1,600 responses, almost all from owners of businesses with fewer than 100 employees. There were no statistical differences between the responses the association received before and after the terror attacks, Mr. Gonzalez said.
"The outlook is grounded in disappointing business conditions that preceded the horrible events of Sept. 11," he said.
Philip Kirschner, the association's executive vice president, said most respondents named health insurance costs as the biggest problem they face in the coming year, followed by property taxes.

HEADLINE: Albany Slow to Divide Millions for Charities 

BYLINE:  By JAMES C. McKINLEY Jr. 

DATELINE: ALBANY, Nov. 22 

 BODY:
A month after the State Legislature voted to distribute about $200 million among scores of charities that provide social services, lawmakers have still not decided how to divide the money, and some organizations have been forced to lay off workers in the meantime.
 The Legislature's slowness to act has sown chaos among the many nonprofit groups that provide everything from lawyers for indigent families facing eviction, to counseling for people dying of AIDS, to treatment for drug addicts. 
 The Haitian Women's Program, a social services center in a storefront in Park Slope, Brooklyn, is typical of the small charities struggling with a steep drop in state support this year.
The director, Gabrielle Kersaint, said that on Oct. 31 she finally had no choice but to lay off a social worker who helps people dying of AIDS make arrangements for their children because the state had not renewed the $100,000 annual grant for the program. Two other experienced social workers moved on to other jobs, she said, because they feared their positions would disappear. 
"This kind of craziness really destabilizes a small agency," Ms. Kersaint said. "It does anger me, because we were already struggling and now it's even worse and there is no guarantee the money will be restored."
Assembly and Senate leaders say they are bogged down in a tedious and politically charged game of triage. The Legislature normally distributes $300 million to $500 million in grants to charities across the state. But this year, lawmakers faced a fiscal crisis and a governor determined to cut costs in the wake of the September terror attack and a slumping economy. In the end, they appropriated only $200 million for the charities, and said each house would decide how to spend half of it.
"It's like trying to squeeze a watermelon into an acorn," said Charles Carrier, a spokesman for the Assembly's Democratic majority.
Instead of giving each member a certain sum, the leaders asked lawmakers in both houses to submit lists of their favorite programs, and the leaders are trying to determine which are most deserving of help. Under the budget agreement hammered out last month, Gov. George E. Pataki is required to approve their choices before money is released. 
The winnowing has proved difficult, lawmakers say. To begin with, Mr. Pataki left dozens of programs for the poor out of his January budget proposal on the assumption that Assembly Democrats would want to restore them and would, therefore, give him something in trade. 
But the political winds shifted after Sept. 11, and with a fiscal crisis looming, the governor refused to restore any of the Democrats' pet programs. 
As a result, the Assembly speaker, Sheldon Silver, is seeking to use some of the $100 million under his control to keep alive programs intended to fight AIDS, prevent domestic violence, provide legal services to the poor and house the mentally retarded, among other things.
At the same time, Assembly members have asked Mr. Silver for their usual wish list of projects in their districts -- known as "member items" -- which are of immense political importance and in recent years have cost upward of $170 million. The staff of the Ways and Means Committee has been wading through that roster, trying to single out indispensable services with no other financing. 
The Ways and Means chairman, Herman D. Farrell Jr., said his staff was pressing charity directors to find out how long they can stay in business with the least amount of state help. "It's triage," he said. "It will look like it has no pattern, but the pattern will be based on how can we spread that $100 million to keep them for another day."
On the Senate side, the Republican majority Leader, Joseph L. Bruno of Rensselaer County, has given more control over his $100 million to his fellow Republicans, aides said. Each senator has been given a spending cap and has been asked to submit recommendations to Mr. Bruno, who said he intended to sift through them and make a final cut. 
"It has to be scrutinized even more carefully this year," said a spokeswoman for Senator Bruno, Marcia White. "We have to be very careful. It's difficult to make a determination about who's needy and who's not needy."
When the $200 million was appropriated, Mr. Bruno and Mr. Silver said the bill would lay out strict criteria for charities to be financed, limiting them to those that provide "direct human services or emergency relief services." 
But the final version of the bill broadened the criteria to encompass any program financed the previous year that might have to lay off workers if it did not get money again this year. Some critics say the watered-down language opened a loophole to let less critical programs, like youth sports leagues, get a piece of the pie.
The selection process is also murky, lobbyists for social service agencies complain. The decisions are being made without public hearings.
Lobbyists say that because of the late budget, many charitable groups were already running on fumes before Sept. 11. Some have already trimmed staffs, making it harder for them to resurrect services if they do receive money.
"The question is how many programs will close in this interim period while they decide who to fund," said Ron Deutsch, the executive director of the Statewide Emergency Network for Social and Economic Security, which represents hundreds of social service agencies. "It's not like a water faucet. You can't just turn it off and turn it on."
Groups providing legal services have been particularly hard hit. For instance, Legal Services for New York City, which receives money from both the federal and state governments to represent the poor in court in cases involving domestic violence, welfare eligibility, tenant-landlord disputes and Social Security benefits, had been scheduled to get $3.5 million from Albany this year but has received nothing so far.
It has laid off 21 lawyers and paralegal workers in the last week, most of them in Brooklyn. An additional four lawyers quit in anticipation of being laid off, said Ghita Schwarz, the president of the union representing the legal staff. It has closed its office in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. Another office has stopped representing people in housing court.
"It's a horrible loss," Ms. Schwarz said. "New York's poor didn't vanish when the twin towers collapsed. For many of these people, their economic circumstances worsened."

HEADLINE: Adapting To a World Less Ready For a Party 

BYLINE:  By JAYSON BLAIR

 BODY:
Deborah Williamson and Mary Wible left special event and public relations jobs at Conde Nast Publications almost two years ago, using cash investments from friends to start a small business planning parties in Manhattan.
 It was risky, to say the least. "There have been lots of scary moments," Ms. Wible said. 
 The bet more than paid off. Their business, Swell Productions, opened a four-person office in a loft on Franklin Street in TriBeCa. They were able to make an operating profit within eight months, pay back some of their investors and watch the business continue to grow even as the economy began to slump earlier this year.
But recently, Ms. Williamson and Ms. Wible have had more of those scary feelings. The terrorist attacks on Sept. 11 and the economic slowdown have hurt corporate and individual entertainment budgets, causing people to postpone, tone down and in some cases cancel extravagant and expensive parties. 
And the attacks added another troubling element to the equation for a party: figuring out the appropriate colors, decorations and hors d'oeuvres has become as complicated of late as drumming up new business.
"To say that we are not worried would not be honest," Ms. Wible says now. "There is no one in this business that is not worried. I think in this industry, in every industry, it is a troublesome time for everybody. Our world has really changed."
In many ways, Swell Productions' situation is similar to that of other party planners, catering companies, florists and others in the business of facilitating fun. 
A recent survey by a group called the Meeting Professionals International Foundation concluded that the business of parties was at a 10-year low in Manhattan, although the group acknowledged that this was an estimate based on anecdotal information. The foundation, an industry trade group, was formed after the Sept. 11 attack on the World Trade Center with the help of NYC & Company, the city's convention and visitors' bureau, and the ailing events and meetings industries.
"The threat is to the smaller businesses in our industry, the balloon blowers, the florists and other small companies," said Richard Aaron, the president of BizBash, a Manhattan consulting company for event planners and other companies involved in the party business. "They are the ones that can be put out of business when shows get canceled."
BizBash officials, too, say there are no hard numbers for how much the cancellation of parties has contributed to the tens of thousands of layoffs in the restaurant, catering, hotel and planning businesses. The attack has taken hundreds of millions of dollars already this year from a $4 billion industry when meeting, party and convention planners; catering companies; and sites are included, according to BizBash. 
Among the companies that Swell works closely with, several people have been laid off and business has slowed down.
At one of those companies, Avi Adler Design, a floral and decor outfit in Carroll Gardens, Brooklyn, the two partners have made big cuts in their own salaries, laid off 2 of their 10 employees, sold storage space across the street and instructed workers to make fewer calls on their cellular telephones and not to take toll bridges and tunnels into Manhattan.
In the week after the attack, at least four shows the firm was designing floral arrangements and decorations for were canceled, including a large party for the clothing designer Hugo Boss that was supposed to take place in an empty loftlike space within the cavernous Starrett-Lehigh Building on West 26th Street. 
"It was really weird during the first few weeks, not just the financial end of it," said Avi Adler, one of the two partners. "The trucks were loaded up and ready to go, and all of a sudden there were no parties. People wanted to just stay home." 
Mr. Adler, a former painter, gives the example of a Glamour magazine "Woman of the Year" event for which his company handled the decorations and Swell handled planning. The event, which was postponed after the attack and then rescheduled for Oct. 29 at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, turned out to be decidedly less glamorous than had originally been planned.
"After Sept. 11, when we realized the event was taking place, we totally changed our original concept of coloring everything," Mr. Adler said. "Originally, it was going to be sexy. The main color was going to be red. And eventually it became very beautiful and soft white and cream tulips and roses and orchids, and the lighting was very soft."
The Glamour party also added patriotic themes. Several women, including those struggling to expand women's rights in Afghanistan, were honored. 
Even caterers -- like Tentation, a French company that handled the Glamour event -- have also adapted. The company has had to cut back on its temporary workers and is using "comfort" foods, including miniature hamburgers, macaroni and cheese, hearty winter stews and "I Love NY" cookies.
"People are much more careful and are keeping in mind what is in good taste," said Martha McGuinness, a Tentation spokeswoman. "They don't want to do things that are garish or frivolous." 
It is hard to tell when or how this business will begin to rebound, but there are some positive signs. At least Ms. Wible and Ms. Williamson are optimistic.
On the morning of Sept. 11, Ms. Wible had a full calendar for the next two weeks. That night they were coordinating a Conde Nast Traveler party at a chic French restaurant for the magazine company's all-star issue and a new book by the photographer Brigitte Lacombe. On Sept. 12, they were supposed to handle a private 100th-anniversary celebration for House & Garden magazine at Sotheby's. During the next week, they had Gourmet magazine's 16th-anniversary party at the Whitney Museum and the Yahoo Internet Life Magazine at the Hammerstein Ballroom.
Hours after Ms. Wible watched the second plane slam into the south tower as she walked to work on West Broadway, the calendar was empty. 
Conde Nast Traveler canceled its event and gave the money it had planned to spend to a relief fund. Yahoo Internet Life has not been able to find a date that will accommodate the celebrity singers and bands that were supposed to appear. And House & Garden has not figured out what to do.
But one bright spot came recently for Ms. Wible and Ms. Williamson. Gourmet decided to reschedule its party for December.

 CORRECTION:
An article yesterday about a slowdown in the Manhattan party planning business misstated the anniversary being observed by Gourmet magazine, which postponed a party. It was the 60th anniversary, not the 16th.

Apocalyptic Theology Rises In Aftermath of Terrorism
At Christian bookstores across the nation, titles on biblical prophecy are flying off the shelves. Christian Web sites are brimming with interpretation on the meaning of the Sept. 11 attacks and their place in the prophetic timeline. Pastors like the Rev. Russ G. Shinpoch of Wildwood Baptist Church in Acworth, Ga., predict that the second coming is near. "As far as we know, there's no more prophecy to be fulfilled," he said. "It literally could be any day."

Thanksgiving Day Parade Reaffirms City's Resilience
There were the usual swarms of clowns, the high-kicking cheerleaders and the puffed-up cartoon characters sailing through canyons of steel and glass. But for all its relentless levity and unapologetic commercialism, the 75th annual Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade was partly transformed by patriotic pomp and recast as a raucous affirmation of New York's resilience in the face of tragedy. Lady Liberty replaced Tom Turkey at the front of the procession; the red and white candy canes in Santa's sleigh wore ribbons of red, white and blue; and a waving Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani drew far more cheers than either Barney or the Rugrats. D1

Football occupies a particularly complicated position in this community of 14,000, which is in a kind of social time warp on the edge of the Everglades. In some ways, Belle Glade is remindful of the separate-but-equal days of the segregated South, and the sport is the primary diversion in a town that lacks even a movie theater. "It's more of a way of life here," said Larry Antonacci, the assistant coach. "Kids eat, drink, sleep, dream football." S1

HEADLINE: HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL; 
A Town Where Football Is the Glue and the Hope

BYLINE:  By JERE LONGMAN 

DATELINE: BELLE GLADE, Fla., Nov. 22 

 BODY:
The sugar cane harvest is under way, as trucks line up to transport the sweet stalks, acrid fires burn off the leafy undergrowth and smokestacks puff from the sugar mills. In a verdant town where the welcome signs say, "Her Soil Is Her Fortune," this is the money season.
 The nation's largest crop of sweet corn also grows in the rich black muck on the northern edge of the Everglades and the southern shore of Lake Okeechobee. Equally reliable is the annual bumper crop of football victories produced by Glades Central High School. The Raiders have won all 12 games this season, and 47 in a row, advancing to Friday's quarterfinal round of the playoffs and toward a fourth consecutive state championship. 
 Seven former players are now in the National Football League, including running back Fred Taylor of the Jacksonville Jaguars and receiver Reidel Anthony of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. No other high school has produced as many current professionals, according to the N.F.L. Eight of this year's 31 seniors are Division I college prospects, and numerous Glades Central graduates are participating in some level of college ball, coaches said. 
"It's more of a way of life here," said the assistant coach Larry Antonacci, who grew up in the football-consumed coal region of northeastern Pennsylvania. "Kids eat, drink, sleep, dream football."
The sport exists as the primary diversion in a town that lacks even a movie theater -- "There's nothing else to do," running back Marrio Fraser said. It provides a potential opportunity for a college education, a professional career and an escape from a life of seasonal and migrant farm work. 
These are familiar themes in many high schools. Yet here, football occupies a particularly complicated position in a community of 14,000 that exists in a kind of social time warp.
In some ways, Belle Glade is a reminder of the separate-but-equal days of the segregated South. Glades Central High School is largely non-white, attracting 1,400 African-American, Haitian, Jamaican and Hispanic students. The city's smaller private school, Glades Day School, is predominantly white.
The city manager, like 60 percent of the voting-age population, is black, but four of the five city council members are white.
Belle Glade is also a symbol of the striking disparity in wealth between the affluent eastern coast of Palm Beach County and the poor rural areas 45 miles to the west. 
On one hand, Palm Beach County has the state's highest home values, with a median value of $134,099, according to a 2000 Census survey. Yet the shopping salons of West Palm Beach might as well be in a different country, much less county, from economically depressed Belle Glade and Pahokee, where workers average $12,000 or less in yearly salary, according to James (Hank) Harper, the local state representative. 
"It's like a third world country out there," he said.

The Legacy of 'Shame'
It has been 41 years since CBS broadcast Edward R. Murrow's withering documentary "Harvest of Shame," which depicted the deplorable working and living conditions of migrant workers in this region. Improvements in wages and housing have occurred in recent decades, but the vast majority of the top salaried and supervisory jobs in the local sugar mills go to whites and Cuban-Americans, said Greg Schell, managing attorney for Florida Legal Service's Migrant Farmworker Justice Project. The cane harvest is automated now. African-American and Caribbean workers are mostly relegated to planting sugar cane and harvesting corn by hand, and traveling 50 to 100 miles by bus to pick oranges and tomatoes during other months, he said.
"In many respects, employment prospects for farm workers are worse than they were at the time 'Harvest of Shame' was filmed," Schell said.
While middle-class public housing exists, many blacks in Belle Glade live in rooming houses with communal bathrooms and kitchens that were built decades ago, mainly for single guest workers. Santonio Holmes, the top receiver at Glades Central, said he lived with eight other family members in four rooms, with a bathroom down the hall. The families of some players sleep in shifts because of a lack of bed space, said Derrick Manning, the principal at Glades Central.
In that light, football is embraced here as a harvest of fame, athletic hope amid social hopelessness.
"I see it as my job to go out and make enough money to take care of my mom," Holmes said.
Willie Bueno, who is in his second year as head coach, describes football not as a desperate way out of town, but as a dependable opportunity to succeed. Current players know that many of their predecessors have gone to college and the N.F.L., and that the same is possible for them.
"They want to be part of it," Bueno said. "It might be the greatest thing they've ever been involved in."
At least 8,000 fans are expected for Friday's home game against Rockledge, the state's second-ranked team, and those who cannot get into the stadium will watch from the hoods of their cars. 

The Burden of Expectations
 Belle Glade's players are enrolled in what is called "football class," a recreation period during school in which they watch film or lift weights, Bueno said. Florida permits 20 days of spring practice for high school football, which allows players to remain sharp in the off-season. A number of them also participate in track and field, another sport in which Glades Central is the defending state champion. Fred Robinson, a running back and kick returner, is the state's 100-meter sprint champion. Linebacker William Beckford has been a state wrestling finalist. The team's top player is Ray McDonald, a 6-foot-4, 245-pound defensive end who has committed to play at the University of Florida.
An enduring myth here is that the players are so fast because they grow up chasing rabbits that sprint out of the burning cane fields in the fall. A few players actually do "run rabbits," hunting them with a dog and a stick and selling them for $2 or $3 apiece. 
Expectations of victory are so high, according to Manning, the principal, that a previous coach who lost a playoff game in the early 1990's after blowing a three-touchdown lead was not allowed to ride home on the team bus. Bueno said the story has been embellished, but no one disagrees that the home crowd can be tough. 
"Sometimes you think the community is harder than the coaches," said Al Royal, a receiver and defensive back. Said quarterback Curtis Holley, who has thrown 28 touchdown passes and only 4 interceptions this season: "You don't want the streak to end; you want to be able to pass the torch."
Inadvertently, football might provide a false hope for the Glades Central players, said Schell of the Migrant Farmworker Justice Project. Many athletes are unprepared for the rigors of a college education, he said, and the chances of reaching the pros are statistically slim.
Glades Central has experienced years of insufficient funding and other resources, including a shortage of quality teachers and low expectations from the county school board, Harper, Schell and school officials said. According to Lavoise Smith, the vice principal, Glades Central is the only high school in Palm Beach County ever to have received an "F" grade from the state for its standardized test scores.
The school has special challenges. Its students speak seven languages. Many come from single-parent families and spend much time unsupervised. It is a struggle for some kids just to find clean clothes to wear to school, Manning said. 
"If this was happening with white kids, someone would be screaming and yelling, and someone would be listening," Schell said. "Some people are screaming, but they're being ignored. They have football. You wonder if that somewhat detracts people from looking at the underlying problems and the low achievement."

A Controversial Coach
Last year, Manning, 40, came here from Atlanta to serve as principal. He is credited with a no-nonsense approach that has created a safer environment in the school and a greater urgency for academic achievement. Standardized test scores have risen slightly, but, Manning said, "We have to create that academic balance, so that the school can be noted for something other than football and track."
That balance, though, will have to be created without him. Manning said he was planning after this school year to return to Atlanta, where his wife lives. That may lend some uncertainty to football, as well as to academics.
When he became principal, Manning decided to bolster the teaching staff by requiring all assistant coaches to be full-time instructors. Previously, a number were community volunteers. This mandate upset a former coach, Mickey Freeman, who resigned over the issue of naming his own assistants a week before practice began last season.
Bueno, 33, was elevated from defensive coordinator to head coach. This created tension in the black community. Freeman is black, while Bueno is of Cuban descent. Not only that, but the new coach had attended the rival Glades Day School. Two assistant coaches brought in as teachers are white. 
"The community was outraged," Manning, who is black, said of the decision to make Bueno head coach. At a contentious meeting to announce the coaching change, Manning said, "They wanted to barbecue me." 
Bueno has never lost in 27 games as head coach, yet some black community leaders wanted him released even after he won a state championship a year ago, Manning said.
"If we don't win the state championship again, they're going to expect me to fire him," Manning said.
He did not worry about community reaction, Bueno said, only about winning and keeping his players' best interests in mind.
"I haven't lost yet," Bueno said. "They might string me up if I do. I just keep winning, don't worry about it. One time I thought I lost, but I woke up real quick. It was only a dream. A nightmare."

HEADLINE: Disaster Gives The Uninsured Wider Access To Medicaid 

BYLINE:  By KATHERINE E. FINKELSTEIN 

 BODY:
In a city of lines, some of the longest are now for health insurance.
 By 6 a.m. in Brooklyn, they form outside the Bushwick Medicaid office. And at the Boerum Hill center, they sometimes snake around the block. At Bellevue Hospital Center in Manhattan, they stretch down the hall. 
 The need for health coverage is a vexing old problem that has become much worse since Sept. 11. Before the attack on the World Trade Center, one of four people in New York City had no health insurance. Since then, layoffs have driven the number far higher, though no precise figures are yet available. As a temporary solution, on Sept. 19, the state began offering four months of disaster-relief Medicaid to all low-income residents of the city, not just those directly affected by the attacks.
In the last six weeks, 75,000 families have applied. Before Sept. 11, typically only 8,000 New Yorkers a month applied for Medicaid, health care experts say.
Health insurance has always been an important part of physical and financial security. But since Sept. 11, as the people who lined up Wednesday morning at the Boerum Hill Medicaid office explained, it has become something far more elemental, a life's necessity in a city now preoccupied with death.
"When I lost my job, I was a little upset," said Ronald Edwards, 35, who was laid off several weeks ago by a catering company that used to do business at the World Trade Center. "But when I lost my health benefits?" He paused, shaking his head. "It's really scary right now."
Mr. Edwards said he needed health insurance for dental work and medical treatment for bullet fragments lodged in his chest.
The city's uninsured are professionally and ethnically diverse, and all seem to share the view that this is no time to be without health care, as those waiting in line behind Mr. Edwards made clear: a story editor laid off by her film production company three weeks ago, an immigrant mother with two children who has never fit typical Medicaid requirements, an aunt seeking health insurance for her disabled niece.
The uninsured and their advocates have found far more universal support after Sept. 11, as New Yorkers have faced all kinds of medical needs, including mental health services and continuing medical treatment that had been interrupted by the attacks.
So Gov. George E. Pataki and Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani pushed through legislation that at any other time would have encountered an avalanche of opposition: a government benefit with little screening or paperwork and almost instant enrollment.
Disaster-relief Medicaid comes less encumbered than typical Medicaid. The application form is one page, compared with eight. No documentation other than proof of identity is required. The allowed income levels -- $1,957 a month for a family of four -- are higher than the stringently low Medicaid cutoffs. With computer lines still down and databases in disarray, the process is only a paper one, without a single computer entry. Approval is more or less automatic, compared with a typical 90-day wait.
"It is one of the most amazing things I've ever witnessed," said Elisabeth Benjamin, a supervising lawyer for the health law unit of the Legal Aid Society. After spending years fighting for coverage for her clients, she can now direct them to a one-page form with same-day approval. "It is an extraordinary statement as to the perceived need among uninsured New Yorkers that, for the first time, health care has become accessible."
For Carmen Santana, an unemployed administrative assistant with chronic asthma, the program is nothing short of a miracle. She was laid off in August, with little hope of getting health coverage.
But on Oct. 1, after waiting four hours in line at the Bushwick Medicaid office, she emerged with health insurance and a feeling of intense gratitude.
"Before Sept. 11, you spoke about health insurance, it fell on deaf ears," she said.
Since then, the major stress of her life, figuring out how to pay for medication for herself and her son, who is also asthmatic, has been alleviated. She said of the coverage, "I am so humbled by having it."
Though magical to many, the program is not without flaws. Some who showed up at the Boerum Hill office this week said they were redirected to an ancillary office at Brookdale University Hospital and Medical Center because of staffing shortages.
One woman, who gave her name as Neddy, said she learned about the program only when she showed up at the center, because information was in short supply. "Don't try calling any of the numbers," she said, "because you can't get through."
Several employees at the center complained that the program, though still in its infancy, was being abused by some applicants whose income exceeded the cutoff.
But for those who advocate universal health insurance, the disaster-relief Medicaid is a model of quick, generous coverage that minimizes administrative burdens: it expands and simplifies an existing program.
With this view in mind, the United Hospital Fund, a philanthropy group, has organized several charitable groups to publicize this rare moment of state and federal largess as well as the rising number of uninsured. They are posting promotions in the city's hospitals, libraries and community centers and establishing a toll-free number to dispense information about how to enroll in the new program.
These advocates hope that attitudes toward universal health insurance will shift after the attacks, with coverage seen as a necessary part of national security and economic recovery, so that hospitals do not have to fall short by treating the uninsured.
As James R. Tallon Jr., president of the United Hospital Fund, concluded, "At a national level, health insurance could be part of our overall economic response to the downturn."

HEADLINE: A NATION CHALLENGED: UNEASINESS IN AMERICA; 
Some Mideast Immigrants, Shaken, Ponder Leaving U. S.

BYLINE:  By GREG WINTER 

DATELINE: GARDEN GROVE, Calif., Nov. 21 

 BODY:
Not once in the 33 years he has lived here has Haitham Bundakji thought about leaving. Even when he slept on floors, with a jacket for a blanket and a towel wrapped around his shoes for a pillow, he always considered America to be home.
 It is hard to find a more established man amid the manicured suburbs of Orange County. Personal notes from the mayor appear in his mail. His car is a repository of plaques and civic awards. And when he is not tending to his many properties, Mr. Bundakji is often working as the Muslim chaplain for the local police and sheriff departments, which consider him one of their own. 
 And yet, when the Federal Bureau of Investigation started questioning 5,000 young men from the Middle East in this country on student, tourist and business visas, Mr. Bundakji decided it might be time for him to leave.
"I don't want to live in a police state," said Mr. Bundakji, 53, a native of Jordan. "Most of us ran away from undemocratic regimes in the Middle East. Now we are facing it here."
Convinced that their community has been singled out for scrutiny by law enforcement and still wary of reprisals by vigilantes, many Muslim and Middle Eastern residents of Southern California say some of their friends and family members have left the United States, leading them to wonder whether they should follow.
"We planned to live here forever," said Sara Bavawi, an American citizen from Jordan who has lived here for seven years and whose cousin and four friends returned to the Middle East this month. "But now I think we go back home, too."
Unlike the scores of foreign students who have abandoned college campuses around the country at the urging of their families, many of the residents who have left or are contemplating doing so have been here for a decade or more, often with American-born children who speak only English and have never visited their parents' homelands. 
Others are citizens with their own businesses and homes. Yet they say their anxiety has become so acute that they would rather start over somewhere else than live in fear of being detained by federal authorities and, perhaps even more unnerving, becoming the target of hate crimes. 
"They have begun selling their businesses, their property, packing up to leave," said Bassam Mahdawi, managing editor of Al-Watan, an Arabic newspaper in Anaheim.
It is impossible to arrive at hard figures for how many immigrants have begun leaving, either in Southern California or across the country.
Confident that the crisis will subside, Mr. Mahdawi said he had tried to dissuade friends who had moved back to the Middle East. But his arguments are muted at times, he says, since other friends have been detained by federal agents, leading him to think about leaving as well.
"Every family is talking about it," Mr. Mahdawi said. "Some are serious, some take action and some just talk."
Though hardly noticable to those outside the shy and tight-knit Muslim community, the families that have left are numerous enough to be missed at weddings and weekly prayer services. Goodbye parties for the departing bring word of others who have left with the hope that they will come back in a few years, when things settle down.
Some families leave because the husband has recently lost his job, while others have thriving businesses that they plan to keep going somehow from overseas. 
The idea of an exodus, however small, upsets some elected officials. When a new mosque opened in Garden Grove this month, no fewer than four city council members showed up in freshly pressed suits, along with the mayor and much of his staff, displaying a level of support and welcome that would make even nonimmigrants envious.
"We try to allay their concerns, but there's a certain amount of people you're never going to convince," said Mayor Bruce A. Broadwater. "I think that people who already wanted to leave will use the current situation as an excuse."
Indeed, even before Sept. 11, some Muslim immigrants in California would often wring their hands about the drugs and crime they encountered here, and loudly reminisce about the sense of belonging they could find only in the Middle East. 
And for all those who say they want to leave, there is at least an equal number of families who proclaim that they have never been more determined to remain in the United States. After all, they argue, where else are the economic opportunities so promising and, even in a time of abridged civil liberties, the freedoms so plentiful?
"We're here to stay," said Ahmed Ali, president of the Council of Pakistan American Affairs. "People who say they are going back, they don't know their country anymore. Maybe they are forgetting parts of it."
After so many years in the United States, even those who wish to leave acknowledge that reorienting to life in the Middle East would be difficult. Beyond a likely drop in living standards, there is also the potential discomfort of complying with cultural practices that they have not had to heed since their youth.
"If I go back to Syria, I'm going to be a foreigner there," said Mohamad Nezar Tibi, now an American citizen. 
Still, Mr. Tibi, a software engineer who has been here since 1985, says he never felt unsafe in Syria, as he does now in the quiet enclaves of Corona. Two months ago, an acquaintance of his was murdered in what appears to be a hate crime.
"It feels like I'm left with no other option right now but to leave," said Mr. Tibi. "What else can I do to protect my family?"
How much of the danger is real or imagined is hard to determine. Yet many of the residents who talk about fleeing the United States come from countries like Lebanon and Israel, where safety is hardly a given.
And though federal authorities have detained immigrants as part of their investigation into the terrorist attacks, most appear to have been held on outstanding criminal charges or visa violations, not at random.
Nonetheless, the refrain uttered by residents here is often the same: "I'm scared to death," said Basma Vogelpohl, an Israeli Palestinian who has lived in the United States for 11 years. "I don't want to stay in this country." 
One Lebanese man said he was willing to forfeit the $15,000 deposit he put on a new home before Sept. 11 in order to leave. "When it comes to safety," he said, "you don't care about money."
As professionals and business owners, many Muslims here have the means to leave and start over elsewhere. But whether their fears will translate into mass exodus seems doubtful to many community leaders, unless the crisis continues indefinitely.
"Most of us will continue to live in America until we get kicked out of it," said Samir Abdalla, editor of the Arab World, a weekly newspaper. "But the problem is the feeling in the hearts of every single person: that he doesn't know about tomorrow."

HEADLINE: AUTOS ON FRIDAY/International; 
Trucks of the Taliban: Durable, Not Discreet

BYLINE:  By JOHN F. BURNS

DATELINE: ISLAMABAD, Pakistan 

 BODY:
THEY hanged television sets, and draped trees with videotape pulled in fury from cassettes. Computers were "executed" on the spot, with rifle butts to the monitors. The Taliban and technology were enemies from the start, as Afghanistan's former rulers sought to drag the country back across centuries to their own medieval, village-culture form of Islam.
 But four-wheel-drive trucks? That was something else. From their appearance as a ragtag village militia to their heyday as the puritanical masters of 90 percent of Afghanistan, and through to their helter-skelter flight last week from all but two cities, the Taliban had their own signature vehicles and these seemed at odds with the rulers' theological commitment to a no-tech world. 
 Mullah Muhammad Omar, the Taliban's supreme leader, co-equal on America's most-wanted list with Osama bin Laden, is partial to Chevrolet Suburbans with darkened windows. Mr. bin Laden, like many of the sheiks and princes of Saudi Arabia among whom he grew up, likes Toyota Land Cruisers, as did his military commander, Muhammad Atef, a former Egyptian policeman who is believed to have been killed by American bombing last week.
There is a hierarchy of vehicles among the more important lieutenants of the Taliban and Al Qaeda, Mr. bin Laden's terrorist organization. Not for them anything discreet and durable, to go with the austerity of their faith: nothing but a Land Cruiser will serve. For ordinary fighters, men with long beards and longer barrels on their ubiquitous Kalashnikovs, the vehicle of choice is the Toyota Hilux, a compact pickup truck popular throughout the developing world.
Mullah Omar, a man so elusive that he has not been photographed in years, and has only granted one interview, was spotted in early October in his Suburban, a white vehicle with no outside embellishments. This was according to villagers outside the eastern city of Jalalabad, who reported seeing him stepping out of the vehicle, accompanied by Mr. bin Laden, in an area near an Al Qaeda training camp two days after the American bombing began on Oct. 7.
But automotive modesty has not inhibited the general run of Taliban and Al Qaeda men, and not Mr. bin Laden, either. When he appeared in a videotape released through Al Jazeera television in October, in a desert setting with Mr. Atef and Ayman al-Zawahiri, another Egyptian who completed Al Qaeda's ruling triumvirate, it was in a fleet of Land Cruisers with police-style emergency lights on the roofs.
Other extras visible on the tape, made earlier this year, were the smokestack-like air inductors running up the windshield pillars; Toyota distributes these on vehicles that operate mostly in the sand-choked air of desert regions. The Al Qaeda leaders' vehicles appeared to be free of the side-door graphics favored by many of their followers, whose tastes run to trucks in flame red or electric blue with words like "Rodeo" or "Pick Up" lettered on the sides, with fancy wheels and chromed roll bars.
The presence of these vehicles raises questions, given that the Taliban have been subjected for three years to one of the strictest economic sanctions ever applied by the United Nations. And Afghanistan is one of the world's poorest countries. How can thousands of men who produce nothing of economic value afford vehicles that cost $50,000 or, in the case of luxuriously equipped Land Cruisers, significantly more? 
Part of the answer is that Afghanistan, until two years ago, was the world's largest supplier of the raw opium that was processed into heroin, a traffic that earned hundreds of millions of dollars and, American investigators say, went partly to finance terrorism. But after Mullah Omar responded to international pressure by banning the growing of poppies, that source of revenue dried up.
But very few of the mullahs' big, powerful vehicles had to be bought at all, at least not for anything like the sticker price. Most, according to the export licenses they bear, were acquired through an import-export scam that operated here in Pakistan.
Part of the evidence for this comes from the Toyota Motor Corporation in Japan, which issued a statement after images of the Taliban driving Land Cruisers began to appear on television after Sept. 11. Only one of the company's vehicles -- a Land Cruiser, in 1997 -- had been officially exported to Afghanistan in the previous five years, Toyota said. "Any other Toyota products presently in the country have probably arrived from neighboring countries via unofficial channels" -- that is, they were smuggled.
Toyota's unease at being associated with the Taliban and Al Qaeda is evident. In its September statement, the company said, "Toyota does not have a sales or distribution channel in Afghanistan, and we do not export vehicles to that country."
Somewhat less laconic was Wade Hoyt, Toyota's spokesman in New York, who put the best corporate spin on the situation this week. "It is not our proudest product placement," he said. "But it shows that the Taliban are looking for the same qualities as any truck buyer: durability and reliability."
How the warriors of Islam came by their vehicles works like this: Corrupt importers in Pakistan order vehicles by the hundreds, mostly from distributors in Dubai or Kuwait, and register them for transit to Afghanistan. In practice, the vehicles "fall off the back" of transporters along the way, in provinces of Pakistan adjacent to the border. There, free of duty and tax, they are sold at a fraction of the official price.
In the case of the vehicles used by the Taliban and Al Qaeda, the purchasers of first record -- or no record, since most of the vehicles have no registration papers -- are often the madrassahs, or religious schools. The clerics who run the madrassahs pass the vehicles on to their faith-brothers in Afghanistan. In some cases, according to Pakistani officials, who lose an estimated $1 billion a year in duties in such scams, the vehicles are stolen from the people who obtained them illegally in the first place.
As for why the Islamic warriors of Afghanistan have so favored Suburbans, Land Cruisers and Hiluxes, the answers are simple. Suburbans and Land Cruisers are comfortable, air-conditioned and reliable, and they have large fuel tanks, all qualities much sought-after in this harsh environment. Both vehicles, as well as the Hilux trucks, are good for carrying large numbers of people and weapons.
And the pickups provided ideal platforms for intimidation and enforcement. From their Land Cruisers and Hiluxes, the Taliban were ready to leap down and beat women for showing a glimpse of ankle or to lock a man in a shipping container for three weeks until his beard grew to the approved length. Or, most dismal, to drag an accused adulterer or blasphemer to the soccer stadium for execution.

Terrorist Software

BYLINE:  By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN 

DATELINE: DUBAI, United Arab Emirates 

 BODY:
Over coffee the other day here in the gulf, an Arab friend -- a sweet, thoughtful, liberal person -- confided to me something that was deeply troubling him: "My 11-year-old son thinks bin Laden is a good man."
 For Americans, Osama bin Laden is a mass murderer. But for many young Arabs, bin Laden, even in defeat, is still Robin Hood. What attracts them to him is not his vision of the ideal Muslim society, which few would want to live in. No, what attracts them to him is his sheer defiance of everything young Arabs and Muslims detest their hypocritical rulers, Israel, U.S. dominance and their own economic backwardness. He is still the finger in the eye of the world that so many frustrated, powerless people out here would love to poke. 
 The reason it is important to eliminate bin Laden -- besides justice -- is the same reason it was critical to eliminate the Taliban: as long as we're chasing him around, there will never be an honest debate among Muslims and Arabs about the future of their societies. Think of all the nonsense written in the press -- particularly the European and Arab media -- about the concern for "civilian casualties" in Afghanistan. It turns out many of those Afghan "civilians" were praying for another dose of B-52's to liberate them from the Taliban, casualties or not. Now that the Taliban are gone, Afghans can freely fight out, among themselves, the war of ideas for what sort of society they want.
My hope is that once bin Laden is eliminated, Arabs and Muslims will want to do the same. That is, instead of expressing rage with their repressive, corrupt rulers, or with U.S. policy, by rooting for bin Laden, they will start to raise their own voices. It's only when the Arab-Muslim world sheds the veil of bin Laden, as Afghans shed the Taliban, and faces the fact that 9/11 was primarily about anger and problems with their societies, not ours, will we eradicate not just the hardware of terrorism, but its software.
"We in the West can't have that debate for them, but we can help create the conditions for it to happen," remarked the Middle East analyst Stephen P. Cohen. "America's role is to show the way to incremental change -- something that is not, presto, instant democracy or fantasies that enlightened despotism will serve our interests. We can't just go on looking at the Arab world as a giant gas station, indifferent to what happens inside. Because the gas is now leaking and all around people are throwing matches."
Every day I see signs that this war of ideas is possible: it's the Arab journalist who says to me angrily of the Arab world today, "We can't even make an aspirin for our own headache," or it's Ahmad al-Baghdadi, the Kuwaiti professor, who just published a remarkable essay in Kuwait's Al Anbaa and Egypt's Akhbar Al Youm entitled "Sharon Is a Terrorist -- and You?"
" Ariel Sharon was a terrorist from the very first moment of the . . . Zionist entity," wrote Mr. Baghdadi. But what about Arab-Muslim rulers? "Persecuting intellectuals in the courtrooms of Arab countries , trials of intellectuals for heresy, . . . all exist only in the Islamic world. Is this not terrorism? . . . Iraq alone is a never-ending story of terrorism of the state against its own citizens and neighbors. Isn't this terrorism? . . . The Palestinian Arabs were the first to invent airplane hijacking and the scaring of passengers. Isn't this terrorism? Arab Muslims have no rivals in this; they are the masters of terrorism toward their citizens, and sometimes their terrorism also reaches the innocent people of the world, with the support of some of the clerics. . . . Ours is a nation whose ignorance makes the nations of the world laugh! The Islamic world and the Arab world are the only places in which intellectuals -- whose only crime was to write -- rot in prison. The Arabs and Muslims claim that their religion is a religion of tolerance, but they show no tolerance for those who oppose their opinions. . . . Now the time has come to pay the price . . . and the account is long -- longer than all the beards of the Taliban gang together. The West's message to the Arab and Muslim world is clear: mend your ways or else" (translation by MEMRI).
We must fight the ground war to get bin Laden and his hardware. But Arabs and Muslims must fight the war of ideas to uproot his software. The sooner we help them get on to that war, the better. Ask the folks in Kabul.

HEADLINE: Fuel Targets for Sport Utilities Pose Difficulties for Automakers 

BYLINE:  By DANNY HAKIM 

DATELINE: DETROIT, Nov. 22 

 BODY:
Top executives of the Big Three automakers pledged anew in recent interviews to improve the fuel economy of their fleets of sport utility vehicles. But some of them are casting doubt on whether the goal set by Ford Motor last year -- a 25 percent improvement by 2005 -- can be met.
 Ford Motor pledged in the summer of 2000 to improve the fuel economy of its sport utilities by about 5 miles a gallon, from about 20 miles a gallon. That is well beyond federal standards, which have not been toughened significantly in more than a decade and require an automaker's fleet of sport utilities and other light trucks to average 20.7 miles a gallon. After Ford's move, General Motors and Chrysler responded not by specifying numerical goals of their own but rather by promising to match or beat Ford's gains. 
 After a recent management shake-up, Ford's new top executives say they are still committed to reaching their goal. But some recent developments will make it harder. And executives at G.M. and the Chrysler Group publicly and privately question whether Ford, now in the middle of a major cost-cutting and turnaround effort -- or any other company -- can reach that goal. 
"Taking 25 percent out in five years is very ambitious," said Dieter Zetsche, chief executive of the Chrysler Group. "This is still a stretch." 
Jacques A. Nasser, chief executive of Ford until his resignation last month, made the pledge in July 2000.
At the time, Ford's fortunes were on the rise, and the company was Wall Street's pick among the Big Three. That has changed. William Clay Ford Jr., Mr. Nasser's successor as chief executive and the first Ford family member to assume operational control of the company in more than two decades, inherits a company whose cash reserves have dwindled, that has continued to lose market share and that is on its way to its first year of net losses in nearly a decade.
Mr. Ford, 44, is an outspoken advocate of environmental goals in an industry hardly known for being green and remains committed to reaching the 25 percent goal. But his company this month scrapped one of the plans it had to get there: outfitting next-generation Ford Explorers with a special starter generator that would allow the engine to shut off automatically when the vehicle was stationary and then restart. The move bitterly disappointed environmentalists.
"After going out of his way to stress his environmental commitment, it is deeply distressing that Mr. Ford's first move as C.E.O. is to reject a more efficient Explorer," said Daniel Becker, director of global warming issues for the Sierra Club.
That said, even Mr. Becker acknowledges that Mr. Ford has "come into a position where he has to turn around a company that is losing money hand over fist." 
Executives at G.M. and Chrysler followed up the pledge Mr. Nasser made last year with pledges of their own. But in recent interviews, their chief executives reiterated that they had never promised to improve their average sport utility fuel economy 25 percent. Instead, they pointed out, they had pledged only to stay ahead of Ford. 
"Continuing to be better than Ford is what we said we'd do," said Rick Wagoner, chief executive of G.M. "We stack up very well against Ford -- in fact, not just Ford. Particularly if you look at truck products, we stack up very well against Toyota, or others, product by product."
In fact, G.M. officials have said they were ahead of Ford's sport utilities, pickup trucks and minivans and would remain ahead.
Mr. Zetsche of Chrysler had a similar position. "We have at least the same technology capabilities and the same willingness to improve fuel efficiency," he said. "Therefore I don't believe we would be at a disadvantage." 
G.M. has a slight lead over Ford and DaimlerChrysler, the parent of Chrysler, judging by 2000 model projections made by the Union of Concerned Scientists, an environmental group based in Cambridge, Mass.
The average for G.M.'s entire fleet was 24.2 miles a gallon, compared with 23.9 miles a gallon for Ford and 23.1 for DaimlerChrysler. All three were well behind the 26.4 miles a gallon average for Toyota and the 29.8 for Honda, largely because Japanese automakers sell a far smaller proportion of light trucks. 
The fuel economy of sport utilities and other light trucks and the nation's dependence on foreign oil is a subject of renewed debate as the country is at war. The rise of the sport utility lowered the miles per gallon of the average new vehicle produced last year to the lowest point in more than two decades, according to the Environmental Protection Agency. 
That trend does not appear headed for much change soon.
October was the biggest sales month in the industry's history, driven largely by a wave of interest-free financing deals that were great for buyers but costly for the Big Three. At the same time, G.M., Ford and Chrysler now all sell more light trucks than they do cars, and foreign automakers like Toyota are flooding the sport utility market. Thus, real fuel-economy gains are to be made with bigger vehicles like sport utilities, to which the market is moving, Mr. Ford said. 
"Our charge is to make those vehicles that they are buying as environmentally sound as we possibly can," he said recently, "because in the end we can't dictate customer choice, nor should we try to."
Ford intends to improve the fuel economy of its fleet by doing things like making a hybrid electric-gasoline engine for its popular new Escape, a smaller sport utility.
G.M. has similar plans for its GMC Sierra and Chevrolet Silverado pickups. Incremental improvements are also likely to be taken with technologies like more efficient transmissions, tire design, trimming weight and more efficient engine valves. By the end of the decade, the industry has said, it will begin producing the first crop of cars powered by fuel cells, which many see as a solution to gasoline consumption and the emission of global warming gases, though numerous hurdles remain to making fuel cells an affordable solution.
A 25 percent improvement in sport utility fuel economy alone would not wean the country of its dependence on Middle East oil but could be part of a broader strategy to do so. For instance, if the fuel-economy requirement for all light trucks were raised to the level of cars, a jump of about seven miles a gallon, roughly a million barrels of oil a day would eventually be saved, out of the 19 million barrels consumed every day in the United States.
This is a goal environmentalists say can be easily reached, largely with existing technologies, but auto executives argue that that would be prohibitively costly in the next few years.
The savings would be more than half of the 1.7 million barrels a day the United States imports from Saudi Arabia, which provides most of the oil imported by the country from the Middle East. A similar toughening of requirements for passenger cars could make up the difference.
Environmental groups have been losing these arguments for some time. The last change in corporate average fuel economy standards for cars came in 1989 and in 1994, by a small increment, for light trucks. But the Senate will start wrangling over a new energy bill in coming months in a political climate reshaped by the terrorist attacks.

HEADLINE: Chase and J. P. Morgan's Paper Anniversary; 
A Year After the Merger, Rosy Plans Meet Reality

BYLINE:  By RIVA D. ATLAS 

 BODY:
When William B. Harrison Jr. speaks of last year's $31 billion merger of J. P. Morgan and the Chase Manhattan Corporation, he speaks proudly of a deal that he considers to be a capstone to his 34-year career of helping build a giant of the banking business.
 "This is the first merger I've been part of," said Mr. Harrison, the chief executive of the combined bank, "where I feel our core business is complete." 
 The Chase-J. P. Morgan combination helped advance the bank into the investment banking elite, just as Mr. Harrison intended. But with Wall Street and the economy in far different places today than they were when the deal was put together, the many mergers, stock sales and other money-making opportunities that were supposed to justify the high-priced acquisition have largely dried up for now. 
Consequently, deal makers and analysts who follow the bank are already speculating that Mr. Harrison, 58, may ultimately be compelled to do yet another large deal, this time to diversify his business away from its heavy emphasis on Wall Street.
J. P. Morgan Chase has won some prominent assignments, like handling the revampings of troubled giants like Lucent and, more recently, Enron, the beleaguered energy trading company.
But while J. P. Morgan Chase is proud of serving alongside Citigroup as both lead lender and adviser to Enron on its acquisition by Dynegy, the dual role it has worked to achieve sometimes proves complicated for the bank. With Enron's shares in free fall as more information comes out about its hidden debts, J. P. Morgan Chase has been scrambling to maintain the support of other banks while simultaneously keeping the merger with Dynegy on track.
Thanks largely to the slump on Wall Street, J. P. Morgan Chase's profits fell by two-thirds in the third quarter, to $449 million from $1.4 billion in the period a year ago. Its stock has dropped 15 percent this year, more than other banks' shares. The bank's stock is ahead of investment banks like Goldman Sachs, with which J. P. Morgan Chase increasingly competes.
"The jury is still out in many respects on this merger," said Judah Kraushaar, an analyst at Merrill Lynch. Nevertheless, he likes J. P. Morgan Chase's stock, he said, because "expectations are very low."
All J. P. Morgan Chase's competitors are suffering from the slowdown on Wall Street. But some, like Citigroup, are better diversified and have greater involvement in old-fashioned consumer banking, which is proving to be a strong moneymaker this year.
Nearly a third of J. P. Morgan Chase's revenues are consumer-oriented. By contrast, its chief New York rival, Citigroup, gets half its revenues from consumer businesses.
"The timing of the merger was bad," said Steven Wharton, a banking analyst at Loomis, Sayles & Company, which owns about a million J. P. Morgan Chase shares. "There's no disputing that."
Actually, Mr. Harrison disputes it. "I can't tell you how happy I am about having done this merger," he said in a recent interview. "While there are pluses and minuses to operating in a weak economic environment, we have a much stronger platform to manage with during this difficult time."
In Mr. Harrison's favor is his battle-tested team of top executives who have worked together for a decade or more. Few executives remain in the top spots from the old J. P. Morgan. Instead, most major posts are filled by managers who have worked with Mr. Harrison since his days at Chemical Bank, where he spent most of his career. Mr. Harrison's team successfully gobbled up Manufacturers Hanover Bank in 1991, then followed that with Chemical's merger with Chase Manhattan in 1996 before incorporating Morgan into the fold last year.
The group of Chemical veterans includes Marc J. Shapiro, who oversees finance and risk management at J. P. Morgan Chase; Donald H. Layton, one of two leaders of investment banking; and James B. Lee Jr., the bank's senior deal maker. The team also includes Dina Dublon, the bank's chief financial officer.
Two other senior executives have also lived through big deals. Geoffrey T. Boisi, the other investment banking leader, was the one-time investment banking chief at Goldman, Sachs. David A. Coulter, in charge of Chase's retail bank, had been chief executive of Bank of America before it was bought by NationsBank.
"There aren't many teams that have gone through as many mergers as Bill Harrison and his team," said Mark G. Solow, managing principal at GarMark Advisors, an investment firm, and a former senior executive at Chemical.
Still, Ms. Dublon acknowledged that the tough economy was making the J. P. Morgan takeover more difficult than the earlier combinations.
"In general, mergers are very hard on morale," she said. "There is no question that this one has a tougher emotional toll."
The bank's executives are making the best of a bad situation. They have taken advantage of the slowdown to cut around 8 percent of the combined banks' staff, or about 2,500 more employees than anticipated at the time the merger was announced.
Many of these job cuts were aimed at high-cost investment bankers: J. P. Morgan Chase expects that 6,000 jobs in its investment banking division will have been eliminated by the end of the year.
"We have focused on the tougher jobs to cut," Ms. Dublon said.
In some ways the overall market turmoil has made it easier for J. P. Morgan Chase to overhaul its staff. With fewer jobs available on Wall Street, Mr. Shapiro said, the employees who are left behind are less apt to complain about changes in their jobs. "People have fewer options," he said, "so you have a little more control over the process."
Thanks partly to these cuts, the bank estimates the saving from cost cutting will be $3.6 billion annually, compared with an original projection of $2 billion at the time of the merger.
The cost cutting has helped compensate somewhat for a sharp drop in profits in the bank's core businesses. "What we can control and are managing very aggressively is the expenses of the company," Ms. Dublon said in a conference call with reporters on Oct. 17, the day earnings were announced.
Aside from cost cuts, the weakness on Wall Street makes it hard for the bank's executives to point to tangible gains in investment banking, where fees were down 24 percent in the third quarter. But Mr. Harrison points to market-share gains the bank has achieved at the expense of competitors on Wall Street. He hopes that when the investment banking business revives, J. P. Morgan Chase will hold on to these gains.
The bank is particularly proud of its standing in two areas: mergers and acquisitions, and the underwriting of large investment-grade bond deals.
The bank ranked 5th worldwide in the highly profitable category of advising on mergers during the first nine months of 2001, up from Chase's 12th-place finish and J. P. Morgan's 10th-place standing during the same period last year, according to Thomson Financial Securities data.
The merger and acquisitions business, which Chase had been slowly building for years, is stronger following the merger with J. P. Morgan, said Mr. Lee, a vice chairman at the bank. As a result, the bank is able to win assignments providing advice to customers who dealt with the old Chase only for loans.
Mr. Lee remains proud of the bank's work with Enron, the energy company, despite its troubles. J. P. Morgan Chase, along with Citigroup, raised $1 billion in bank financing for Enron earlier this month. It was also hired to advise the company, which hopes to be saved from collapse by being taken over by Dynegy.
The old Chase, long a lending powerhouse, would have had a good shot at leading the bank financing, but an advisory role would have been less certain. Mr. Lee said the investment banker advising Enron came from the old J. P. Morgan. But with merger activity slow, there are few such deals to go around.
The bank is also proud of its strength in long-term investment-grade bonds, another area that business executives say has been enhanced by the merger. It moved up to second place in that area so far this year, compared with sixth place a year ago.
The bank has taken advantage of a boom in large corporate bond offerings, a surge driven by today's low interest rates. In May J. P. Morgan Chase raised $12 billion in bonds for WorldCom, the telecommunications company, in the largest corporate debt deal in the United States on record.
Unfortunately for J. P. Morgan Chase, the fees for underwriting investment-grade debt are small compared with the money to be earned coordinating offerings of stock, where J. P. Morgan Chase remains a second-tier competitor.
The bank actually lost market share in the rankings for underwriters of stock, falling to 9th place this year, compared with the old J. P. Morgan's 6th-place finish a year ago. (Chase was 11th.) 
Mr. Harrison said the bank was taking advantage of the slowdown in stock offerings to build momentum slowly in that business. "We think we have a chance in the second half of this year to be in the top five," he said.
Given the slowdown, some bankers predict that Mr. Harrison will ultimately do another deal, either to expand his consumer banking business or to bolster weak areas in investment banking, like the equity division.
"The general view is that the combination with J. P. Morgan didn't do enough," one investment banker said.
Mr. Harrison disagrees: "I don't feel," he said, "we need to do another large deal to be successful."

Morgan and Chase announced their merger in September 2000, the combination's strength in investment banking seemed sure to be successful.

HEADLINE: City Agencies Are Struggling With Cutbacks 

BYLINE:  By JENNIFER STEINHAUER 

 BODY:
New York City agencies are scrambling to make 15 percent cuts needed to close this year's $1 billion budget shortfall, but those cuts will do little to lessen next year's gap, which is expected to be about $4 billion, experts said.
 In October, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani signed an executive order freezing $1 billion in city spending, a move intended to help New York recover from the terrorist attack, which significantly slowed the city's revenue stream. By using his executive power to balance the city's budget, Mr. Giuliani sidestepped the normal budget process, which involves end-of-the-year compromises with the City Council over spending decisions. 
 But few cuts resulting from that freeze will help Mayor-elect Michael R. Bloomberg, who will face a roughly $4 billion shortfall next year, officials and budget experts said, in large part because of the city's generally slowing economy. 
Long-term savings in the budget can result from substantially reducing recurring costs, like the number of welfare and Medicaid recipients. But as the city's economy continues to sputter, welfare and Medicaid costs tend to rise. Longterm savings also tend to come from providing services more efficiently, like reducing the number of sanitation workers on a route, but that type of change tends to take a while to make. 
"Some of the cuts will have a recurring benefit, but not most of them," said a senior city official. "Those will be the choices for the next mayor to make. Our job is to hand over a budget on Jan. 1 that is going to be balanced at the end of the fiscal year. The groundwork will be there, but the choices for next year will be made by the next mayor."
As part of the October freeze, Mayor Giuliani told almost every city agency to look for 15 percent in cuts. The mayor's budget team is negotiating with city agencies over those cuts now, and has been tight-lipped about them, even keeping the content of those talks from the City Council, whose leaders had hoped to be able to brief incoming members about the current budget issues.
A City Hall spokeswoman, Sunny Mindel, said the mayor intended to "hand over to the next mayor a balanced budget." She declined to be specific about coming budget cuts, and would not permit other city officials to provide the details.
Some trends can be seen, however.
Cultural institutions have been told by the city's Department of Cultural Affairs, which has a budget of $137 million, to make 15 percent cuts across the board. In previous years, the mayor has insisted that larger museums and institutions face less pain, while forcing smaller groups to bear the brunt of trims, something the agency would like to see avoided this time around. Still, agencies' budget recommendations to the mayor are only recommendations, and he can reject them. 
The $13 billion culture industry, already suffering from a large drop in tourism, is scaling back exhibitions and laying off workers. "Hopefully, we will be able to live with it," said the cultural affairs commissioner, Schuyler G. Chapin. "We have given them a series of suggestions. I think everyone in the cultural community that has funding from us is concerned."
Libraries are also preparing for the worst. Nov. 4th was the last day of Sunday service for most libraries in Manhattan, and many others reduced their Saturday services. In Queens, all but 3 of 14 branches will also close Sundays, and the book purchasing budget was slashed by 38 percent. Teenagers who help people on computers were let go.
"The mayor has imposed a 15 percent budget cut across the city, and we didn't escape that," said a spokesman for the Queens Borough Public Library, Joe Catrambone. "We are concerned that there will be major changes in how we provide library services in the future," he added, "but we have a partnering role to play in the recovery, and this is what we have to do."
Officials also said cuts would almost certainly be made to items added to the budget in June by the City Council, which had restored cuts made by Mayor Giuliani to libraries, museums, parks and programs for the elderly. Also vulnerable are the dollars the council added for the health department to begin new programs like an H.I.V. prevention campaign and a $5 million program that would try to combat high infant mortality rates in some areas of the city. Several after-school programs are also expected to be scaled back.
The health department will scale down existing programs rather than shelve them altogether, and try to do more modest versions of new initiatives, city officials said. Agencies are also appealing to the federal government to pay for certain things that appear related to the September terrorist attack. The mayor meets daily with budget officials to discuss what cuts he will approve.
The police and fire departments as well as the Board of Education were told to propose much smaller cuts of 2.5 percent, and other departments are asking to do the same. For example, the City University of New York, which receives money from the city for community colleges, has already asked to be held to 2.5 percent trims, citing a state law that requires the city to match the prior year's financial commitment.
However, few steps taken to achieve this year's cuts, which the Giuliani administration has said will be invisible to New Yorkers, will give relief to next year's budget. "To the extent they are real cuts that provide savings, that should help," said Ronnie Lowenstein, who heads the city's fiscal watchdog agency, the Independent Budget Office. "But the options for the next budget are doing cuts, finding ways to increase productivity, and taxes. And it is my understanding that the mayor-elect said that he wouldn't raise taxes."
Further, Mr. Bloomberg will have to settle outstanding contracts with teachers and police officers, and will have to negotiate a new contract with District Council 37, which will see its two-year contract expire in June. In the last round, the council, the city's largest municipal union, got 9 percent raises, setting a standard for other unions. "I don't think anyone is impervious to 9/11," said a union spokesman, Chris Policano. "But in terms of what that will mean for us, I don't think we are there yet."

HEADLINE: Venezuelan Demonstrators Attacked by Government Loyalists 

BYLINE:  Reuters 

DATELINE: CARACAS, Venezuela, Nov. 22 

 BODY:
Riot police officers fired rubber bullets and tear gas today at hundreds of supporters of President Hugo Chavez who attacked some 2,000 antigovernment demonstrators on the streets of the capital.
 Several people were injured in skirmishes around the National Assembly building. The city police struggled to separate about 300 government loyalists from demonstrators carrying placards reading "Chavez Out." 
 During lulls in the clashes, rival factions squared off on street corners in downtown Caracas, throwing rocks or bottles, while a water cannon prowled the area to disperse the throng.
At least three people were struck on the head by flying bottles and required medical attention, witnesses said.
Similar clashes occurred two weeks ago when supporters of Mr. Chavez battled their opponents on the streets of the capital after a demonstration deteriorated into violence.
Recent polls have shown the popularity of Mr. Chavez, a former paratroop officer, falling below 50 percent as many voters tire of his failure to deliver on campaign promises to tackle poverty, corruption and crime. The approval rating of the president, whose term expires in 2007, topped 80 percent after he took office three years ago.
But his "revolutionary" government has faced a wave of criticism recently -- from the Roman Catholic Church, the media, unions, the United States and political parties -- for its authoritarian style and animosity toward the private sector.
Mr. Chavez has insisted that drastic measures are necessary to oust the entrenched elites that have run Venezuela, the world's No. 4 oil exporter, since the country's last dictator was toppled in 1958.
The demonstration today was called by Venezuela's largest opposition party, the centrist Democratic Action, to protest the president's use of special legislative powers to decree far-reaching economic changes without consultation. 
"Our principal weapon is our right to demonstrate against this pitiful situation which is dragging Venezuela through the dirt, humiliated and discredited not only at home but abroad as well," said Henry Ramos, a Democratic Action politician. 
The march quickly deteriorated into chaos as supporters of Mr. Chavez's Fifth Republic Movement tried to block its passage toward Congress. Stores closed as tear gas filled the streets, and the metropolitan police, controlled by the opposition mayor, Alfredo Pena, fired on the government loyalists.
"We are protesting against this march," said Felipe Mundarain, 53, his leg bloodied by a rubber bullet wound. "We are Chavez followers and the police are opening fire on us. 
"They are shooting at ordinary Venezuelans," he said.
Interior Minister Luis Miquelena dismissed the demonstration as insignificant and said the Chavez supporters who attacked it were not members of the Fifth Republic Movement. He criticized Mr. Pena, one of President Chavez's sternest opponents, for using the police against the crowds.
The metropolitan police chief, Henry Vivas, defended the actions of his force, saying, "It is preferable sometimes to throw a tear gas canister rather than pick up a dead body from the floor."

HEADLINE: The Return of the Shopper 

BYLINE:  By Paco Underhill; Paco Underhill is the author of "Why We Buy: The Science of Shopping" and the founder of Envirosell, a research and consulting firm.

 BODY:
In some parts of the world, shoppers must worry about pipe bombs and suicide bombers. Now that terrorists have targeted the United States, some Americans have been feeling nervous enough about going to malls to give the phrase "fear of shopping" a grim new meaning.
 But there is no need for new fears. In many ways, this year's holiday season presents merchants and consumers with all the usual anxieties. Shoppers may be afraid they won't find the gift they want in the time they have, while retailers are apprehensive about whether they have the right merchandise at the right price and whether they provide a pleasant experience. 
 These worries are oddly comforting in their normalcy. In the days immediately after Sept. 11 the malls were deserted. I went to the movies at a mallplex one afternoon in Texas and was the only person in the theater. By the end of October, however, I noticed that many mall parking lots were full. Some malls and stores are reporting traffic is up from last year.
People want to shop; it's in our genes. We are a social species. From our days as hunters and gatherers, we have needed to be around others. Thus the market is not just a place to exchange goods and money. It is also a place to see and be seen. Going to the mall or our kids' soccer game is a community activity, and most of us want to spend some part of every week in a community setting.
So the question is less whether the malls will be crowded than whether the mall will be ready for the crowds. American consumers have been getting progressively harder to please. Since long before Sept. 11, they have been driven by two motivations: value and convenience. They want the best quality, the cheapest price, attentive and knowledgeable customer service, free gift-wrapping and fast checkout -- all in a nicely designed store with cushy sofas, clean restrooms and maybe some free snacks.
This is more than the retail industry can deliver. Americans are destined for disappointment this season if that's what they expect. The list of shortcomings will be endless: out-of-stock merchandise, poor customer service, long waits at checkout, Cheez Doodle crumbs on the dressing-room floor. True, some retail powerhouses are doing better than others, but the industry as a whole is struggling to meet shoppers' expectations.
There are, however, a few bright spots for merchants. The events of the last several months have reminded Americans of the value of friends and family. This is the season when we acknowledge who matters to us. And though economists tell us we are on the edge of a recession, there is the residual effect of enormous wealth created in the last decade.
What has changed is the range of choices available to most shoppers -- and what motivates them to make those choices. No store has everything. That affluent shopper walking into Nordstrom this afternoon, for example, may have been at Costco this morning. The success of this shopping season will depend on how flexible the retail industry is in responding to new tastes and needs. The social stratification of retail is over, and the age of one-size-fits-all marketing has passed. Selling a new cell phone, for example, isn't just about selling technology, but about recognizing that the phone is a fashion accessory for one customer, a business tool for another and a personal safety device for a third. Retailers will find out over the next few weeks whether they've made the right choices.
One thing they can count on is that people like to buy things. Shopping remains a great American pastime. And the nature of holiday shopping isn't likely to change much even in uncertain times.

Re "Harvard's Prize Catch, a Delphic Postcolonialist" (Arts & Ideas pages, Nov. 17):
 I was pleasantly surprised to read about Homi K. Bhabha's appointment to teach in the Afro-American studies department at Harvard. 
Being of Indian descent and having lived in East Africa, I can relate to many of his views. But he will have to simplify some of his more dense prose so that he is understandable to his critics, his students and people in the community. 
 We have come far from the days when the economist John Maynard Keynes referred to a university education as "the inculcation of the incomprehensible into the indifferent by the incompetent."

HEADLINE: West's Envoys, Unhappy, Find Zimbabwe Unhelpful 

BYLINE:  By RACHEL L. SWARNS 

DATELINE: JOHANNESBURG, Nov. 23 

 BODY:
The police found the battered body of Cain Nkala on Nov. 13 in a shallow grave in Bulawayo, Zimbabwe's second largest city. He was a small-town supporter of President Robert Mugabe and a man virtually unknown in the West. But the government's response to his killing has touched off an international furor.
 Over the last two weeks, the authorities in Zimbabwe have arrested more than a dozen members of the leading opposition party and charged them with murdering Mr. Nkala. Government-backed militants threw gasoline bombs at an opposition party office. Officials have branded their rivals and critics "terrorists" and have vowed to introduce tough new laws to restrict movement and assembly. 
 This week, State Department officials in Washington summoned Zimbabwe's ambassador to express concern. Today, a delegation from the European Union raised similar issues in a meeting with Mr. Mugabe in Zimbabwe's capital, Harare. 
But the American and European officials said they left their meetings with little hope that the political climate would improve. Many believe Mr. Mugabe is using Mr. Nkala's death as an excuse to attack his opponents as he braces for the most hotly contested election of his political career.
Mr. Mugabe, 77, has led Zimbabwe for 21 years and his popularity has waned sharply. Once one of Africa's most promising and prosperous countries, Zimbabwe is now racked with food shortages and surging unemployment, and an increasingly authoritarian government seems more and more willing to crack down on its critics at the approach of election day, which is expected early next year.
"We're not really optimistic," Olivier Alsteens, a spokesman for the European Union, said today in a telephone interview after the meeting with Mr. Mugabe in Harare. "The meeting was not good." 
"We expressed our concerns about the threats against some of the opposition leaders, about the media, about the seizure of white farms," Mr. Alsteens said. "But we didn't meet somebody who was listening. He was just closing his ears, I would say. We were hoping there could be some kind of discussion, but not at all, not at all." 
American officials said they had urged Zimbabwe's government to pave the way for fair elections by curbing violence and intimidation and by allowing the opposition access to the media and to voter rolls. 
"We are concerned that time is passing and the situation is deteriorating and the government is not taking steps to create an environment in which you can have elections," an American official said in a telephone interview from Washington. "We needed to be clearly on the record with them." 
Jonathan Moyo, Zimbabwe's minister of information, was not in his office today and could not be reached for comment. 
But a state-controlled newspaper, The Herald, sharply criticized American officials today and accused them of responding to "false and alarmist reports."
The newspaper listed eight Harare-based journalists by name and blamed them for "the obscene misrepresentation of facts," saying they were no better than the so-called terrorists in the opposition party, the Movement for Democratic Change, who authorities say are determined to topple the government. 
Most of the journalists work for foreign news organizations, including The Associated Press.
"It is now an open secret," The Herald said, "that these reporters are not only distorting the facts but are assisting terrorists who stand accused in our courts of law of abduction, torture and murder by covering up and misrepresenting the brutal deeds of the terrorists." 
"We would like them to know that we agree with President Bush that anyone who in any way finances, harbors or defends terrorists is himself a terrorist," the newspaper continued. "We, too, will not make any difference between terrorists and their friends or supporters." 
The government says members of the Movement for Democratic Change abducted Mr. Nkala and strangled him with his own shoelaces on Nov. 5 to avenge the killing of Patrick Nabanyama, an opposition member who disappeared before the parliamentary elections in June 2000.
Opposition party officials acknowledge that Mr. Nkala was widely believed to have been behind Mr. Nabanyama's disappearance, but they deny any involvement in Mr. Nkala's death.
The officials say they believe Mr. Nkala was killed by his own colleagues because he was preparing to disclose the involvement of other government supporters in Mr. Nabanyama's death.
"The society that the government seeks to create is one based on fear that is maintained through violence and oppression," Welshman Ncube, the secretary general of the Movement for Democratic Change, said in a statement this week. "What Zimbabweans need are jobs, education for their children, health facilities and peace. These require a well-thought program of action, not intimidation or brutality."

HEADLINE: States Head Into the Red 

 BODY:
It was only a short time ago that state government was hot. The states, it seemed, had figured out how to do things right, and they were being hailed as the model Washington ought to follow.
 Now, while the war against terror has put Washington back on center stage, the states have been sliding into the red. Thirty-five face budget shortfalls in 2001 or 2002. Like Washington, it turns out that many used their years of plenty to cut taxes without preparing for the proverbial rainy day. 
 Several states got into trouble by relying on rosy economic forecasts of the sort the Bush administration used while campaigning for its massive tax cut. Now most of them are locked into contracts for costly projects like bridges and schools that they can no longer easily afford. Arkansas, Alabama, Arizona, California, Colorado, Kentucky and Wisconsin all have far less money than they expected, according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. At least 30 states are considering tax hikes or widespread cuts in services -- at the worst possible time -- to meet their budget obligations.
Even some unemployment insurance and welfare systems, though backed by money held outside states' general funds, are heading for trouble. Research by the Urban Institute shows that six states -- Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Kansas, Kentucky and Maine -- have zero reserve funds to shore up welfare payments. In this case, Washington shares the blame. The federal government used to offer supplemental grants and a contingency fund to help states with unexpectedly high caseloads, but both those programs expired in September.
During the boom years, most states stockpiled millions of dollars to pay for unemployment benefits during future downturns. But five states -- Illinois (again), New York, North Dakota, Texas and West Virginia -- have trust funds that could pay at most six months of benefits during a full-blown recession. Another 17 states probably lack the funds needed for a full year of benefits during tough times. These states may end up borrowing reserve funds from the federal government and hurting their credit ratings for future debts.
Unlike Congress, most state legislatures do not have the option of selling slews of bonds just to make ends meet. They are in for hard times, and Washington should at the very least try not to make matters worse. If Republicans succeed in their misguided plan to abolish the corporate alternative minimum tax, the repeal could cost states another $5 billion. The Democrats' stimulus plan, which would take at most $2 billion from state coffers, offsets the loss by contributing a much-needed $5 billion to state Medicaid programs in 2002. Congress should also help the recession's economic victims by renewing welfare's supplemental grants and contingency fund for another year.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS AND BONDS; 
Heartened by Holiday Shopping, Shares Rise in Quiet Day

BYLINE:  By Reuters 

 BODY:
Stocks advanced during yesterday's holiday-shortened session as traders snapped up retail stocks, heartened by signs that the year-end shopping season opened with a strong start.
 The discount retailer Wal-Mart Stores and Federated Department Stores, the department store operator, helped bolster the broad-market indexes amid only light trade. Deep discounting has helped bring shoppers into the malls despite some large job losses and the slump in spending that followed the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. 
 Traders also said they were optimistic that the war in Afghanistan might end soon, after reports that some Taliban troops are close to a surrender. 
"It looks like the war is over and traders are getting a jump on it before everyone comes in for work on Monday," said Mace Blicksilver, a money manager for Marblehead Asset Management. "Retailers are doing well and the mood is better," he added.
Hopes for a rebound in the economy and corporate profits sometime next year have driven the market higher in recent weeks, pulling it off the three-year lows that followed the Sept. 11 attacks. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index has closed up for seven of the past nine weeks.
The Dow Jones industrial average rose 125.03 points, or 1.3 percent, to close at 9,959.71, while the broader S.& P. 500 gained 13.31 points, or 1.2 percent, to 1,150.34. The technology-laden Nasdaq composite index advanced 28.15 points, or 1.5 percent, to 1,903.20.
Stocks closed higher for the third consecutive week, with the Dow rising 0.94 percent, the S.& P. 500 gaining 1.03 percent and the Nasdaq inching up 0.24 percent.
Consumers thronged shopping malls yesterday, traditionally the busiest shopping day of the year, a sign that shoppers are willing to spend.
The discount retailer Wal-Mart rose 68 cents, to $55.80, while Federated, parent of the department stores Bloomingdale's and Macy's, gained $1.10, to $38.21.
The S.& P. retail department store index rose 2.63 percent.
The United States-backed Northern Alliance said that it had suspended attacks on the Taliban-held city of Kunduz to allow besieged defenders more time to agree to surrender, but said that it would resume attacks if no deal was struck by this afternoon.
Trading was light, with many portfolio managers taking the day after Thanksgiving off. The stock market closed early at 1 p.m. 
The energy-trading company Enron, which has already plunged to its lowest levels in more than a decade on worries about its credit standing and fears that a proposed rescue by Dynegy could fall through, was the most actively traded issue on the New York Stock Exchange for the third consecutive session. Enron fell 30 cents, to $4.71. Dynegy rose 64 cents, to $40.40.
Treasury bond prices drifted lower yesterday, kicking up yields on the benchmark 10-year note to 5 percent for the first time since August.
Trading was subdued during the shortened session after the holiday. "It's a really light trade; I don't think you're going to have to read too much into it," said Drew Forbes, a trader at Daiwa Securities. "People are very cautious."
Treasuries have sold off sharply in the last two weeks as investors, betting on a swift economic recovery in 2002, have scaled back hopes for an 11th interest rate cut this year when the Federal Reserve meets in December.
Yields on the rate-sensitive two-year notes have spiked more than 0.75 percentage point in two weeks. Thirty-year bonds are now yielding more than they did before the Treasury surprised markets on Oct. 31 by canceling sales of these issues, which set off a huge scarcity rally. 
The 10-year Treasury note fell 15/32, to a price of 100. The note's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 5 percent from 4.95 percent on Wednesday.
The price of the 30-year Treasury bond fell 20/32, to 99 31/32. The bond's yield rose to 5.38 percent from 5.35 percent on Wednesday.

HEADLINE: Medellin Journal; 
A Coffee Icon Rides His Mule Off Into the Sunset

BYLINE:  By JUAN FORERO 

DATELINE: MEDELLIN, Colombia 

 BODY:
Carlos Sanchez saw it coming. Nevertheless, he still had a lump in his throat when, just a few days ago, he received the news: Juan Valdez, the tradition-bound coffee farmer Mr. Sanchez has played in countless American commercials, would soon be shelved. 
 One of advertising's most successful fictional characters, Juan Valdez -- the mustachioed farmer, a poncho over his shoulder and trusty mule at his side -- helped make Colombian coffee world famous. But with coffee prices plummeting to a 30-year low, the Colombian growers group that bankrolled the advertising has been forced to slash its costs. 
 "I still did not think that things would turn out like this," lamented Mr. Sanchez, 66, who has been playing Juan Valdez since 1969. "I thought maybe I would get too old, or I would be replaced, or something."
But for Colombian coffee growers and millions of consumers worldwide is there any replacing the actor or the icon? In the world of marketing, Juan Valdez is considered one of the most successful pitchmen ever -- on par with Mr. Whipple and the Pillsbury Doughboy. Awareness of Juan Valdez in the United States stood at 60 percent last year, with logo identification of Cafe de Colombia reaching 85 percent, ahead of Nike and Michelin. 
Yet Juan Valdez -- unlike those marketing icons -- is a real person: Mr. Sanchez, the second man to play the role, once grew coffee himself but has dedicated most of his life to painting and raising a family.
Youthful for his age, Mr. Sanchez is described by those who have worked with him as the perfect spokesman: patient, diligent, loyal and never too tired to don his farmer's hat and coffee pouch for commercials or to shake hands at sporting events.
"There are few live spokespersons who have had such an endurance," said Peter le Comte, president of DDB Worldwide Marketing, the New York advertising agency that dreamed up Juan Valdez. "There's not many that are like him and are real, that are an actual embodiment of an individual." 
While Juan Valdez has clearly helped sell Colombian coffee -- the advertising meant a $1.6 billion premium for growers in the 1990's -- perhaps his biggest contribution has been to counter the image of Colombia, battered by more than 30 years of guerrilla insurgency, as a cocaine-infested battlefield. 
"I presented the image of the Colombian coffee grower, an honest man, hard-working, traditional," explained Mr. Sanchez, sitting on the porch of his home in Medellin, as a hummingbird buzzed about. "Juan Valdez would get up early, pick coffee, and what happened in time is the character became mythologized."
Despite the icon's success, the crisis in coffee prices brought on by a worldwide oversupply of beans has forced the National Federation of Coffee Growers of Colombia, which markets Colombian coffee, to cut its free-spending ways.
The 73-year-old federation has responded by slashing its work force by 60 percent to 1,500 employees in the last decade, shedding ownership of a bank, and cutting subsidies that built schools and paved roads in coffee-growing regions.
With assets falling to $739 million last year from $1.6 billion in 1997, the federation also ended costly price subsidies to farmers. But the most visible cuts are to advertising, especially abroad, where Juan Valdez has successfully hawked Colombian coffee since 1959. 
Indeed, at Harvard University, first-year marketing students study Juan Valdez, not only because he is an advertising success but also because he made tangible contributions to Colombia's economy, said Rohit Deshpande, a professor of marketing at the Business School.
"This is not just a story about how you get a better price at Safeway," Mr. Deshpande said. "It's an even bigger story about what this means to the people who grow the product."
Created by a Madison Avenue advertising man at Doyle Dane Bernbach -- DDB's forerunner -- Juan Valdez was first used to educate Americans about the origins of Colombian coffee. So early ads showed Juan Valdez, with his mule, crisscrossing fog-shrouded mountains, picking the "richest coffee in the world," as a narrator explained. 
The advertising strategy later showed Colombian coffee drinkers as discerning consumers, so a plane would turn around in midflight after the crew realized the Colombian coffee had been forgotten. The Colombian coffee logo -- Juan Valdez and his mule -- would then appear.
With American coffee consumption falling to 54 percent from 77 percent in 1950, more recent print advertisements pitched Colombian coffee to the young, with Juan Valdez shown hang-gliding or surfing. The commercials' slogan was, "take life by the beans."
In all, the federation spent more than $1.3 billion on advertising in 41 years. But annual spending has dropped from $44 million in 1987 to $16 million last year. This year, $5 million will be spent, just enough to cover contractual obligations.
Carlos Sanchez, as Juan Valdez, will still go to sporting events sponsored by the federation, but big-ticket advertising will largely dry up.
Advertising experts agree that Colombian coffee's competitiveness will be hurt, since consumers increasingly have a potpourri of high-grade coffees to choose from. 
"They lose the essence of the campaign, which creates meaning for the brand," said Mr. Deshpande, the Harvard professor.
Federation officials said they realize the danger. "The publicity is wonderful, and it produces a premium, but if there is no money, how do we pay?" said Andres Lloreda, the federation's publicity director.
For Mr. Sanchez, the development means more time at home with his wife of 43 years, Alma, and two grandchildren. Still, he is rueful.
"Juan Valdez is an integral part of Carlos Sanchez," he explained. "So if Juan Valdez ceases to exist, well, naturally it is like losing a limb."

HEADLINE: The Neediest Cases; 
Art Exhibition to Help Holiday Appeal

BYLINE:  By KATHLEEN CARROLL 

 BODY:
These are tough times for many, including charities. The economy is contracting and Wall Street is in a slump, shrinking potential donations. The Federal Reserve has cut interest rates 10 times this year, whittling away at the interest income crucial to charities with endowments. In addition, some charities fear, the public's spirited reaction to the terror attacks on Sept. 11 could divert attention from enduring problems. These are tougher times for those in need of help in New York City. Last month, 79,000 jobs disappeared. Next month, 32,800 families will reach the five-year federal limit for cash welfare assistance. They can still receive money for rent and utilities through the state, but must reapply. 
 "There's plenty of hardship at any time, but now -- we're just holding our breath," said Jack Rosenthal, president of The New York Times Company Foundation, which administers The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund. 
 In recent years, good times and fat wallets have fueled donations to the fund, as readers respond to articles that appear daily in The Times during the fund's annual holiday appeal.
For the first time in the fund's history, a party will be held to draw attention to its efforts, Mr. Rosenthal said. In mid-January, the foundation will be the host of an exhibition in a Manhattan gallery where a dozen works -- by artists including Francesco Clemente, Chuck Close, Roy Lichtenstein, William Kentridge and Nam Joon Paik -- have been donated by the artists or their estates.
The total amount raised so far this year, about $2.4 million, is down roughly $500,000 from last year. Mr. Rosenthal attributed $350,000 of that difference to a decline in interest income. Still, 22 days into the fund's 90th appeal, donations are filling Post Office Box 5193. 
Readers all over the country responded in great numbers to an article in The Times on Nov. 4 about Robert Tucker, a 60-year-old homeless man who struggles to fit a night of sleep into a long subway ride. Many of his meals are supplied by Project FIND, which last December received a $10,000 grant to provide lunches to elderly people from the Federation of Protestant Welfare Agencies, one of seven charities supported by the Neediest Cases Fund. 
Jane Clair Ellison of Oakland, Calif., sent a check for $50 and wrote, "I am retired, in my mid-60's, single and consider myself very fortunate to have a pension, health care and a home. Granted, my family and circumstances allowed me to prosper, which was not the case with Mr. Tucker. I am mindful, though, that life can play rough with one, and we all could be in trouble."
Hong-Ngoc Nguyen Pham of Silverdale, Wash., donated $30 and wrote, "I was very troubled by Mr. Tucker's story. With the tears I shed, I realized that many people in desperate need are all too often ignored. I hope that what little I can give will provide these individuals with a little more comfort, care and peace." 
Todd Anderson of Washington, D.C., sent a heartfelt letter along with his $10 donation. "I lost my job as a project manager for a high-tech company in May 2001 and ever since then have been struggling to make ends meet," he wrote. "Through either dumb luck or an unwillingness to give up, I've been able to keep my head above water. I felt moved to send a check to help out Robert Tucker and others in situations similar to his. Plus, given my current situation, I'm scared to death that one day, I'll be like Robert Tucker."
Sherry Greenberg of Austin, Tex., gave $200. Her letter read: "I hope The Times will continue to help people understand how important it is to continue to acknowledge the people before 9/11 and after that struggle to live in the city with some attempts at dignity. I hope this helps."

HEADLINE: Facing Decreased Demand for Coins, Mint Starts Layoffs 

BYLINE:  AP 

DATELINE: PHILADELPHIA, Nov. 23 

 BODY:
The United States Mint is laying off workers because the softening economy has sharply reduced demand for new coins.
 Mint officials say they will make only 15 billion new pennies, nickels, dimes and quarters next year, instead of the 23 billion they had planned just last summer. 
 As a result, a spokesman said, the mint has begun laying off 357 workers nationwide, including at major coin-production plants in Philadelphia and Denver. 
"When people are spending less money, there's less transactions out there," the spokesman, Michael White, said.
The drop in demand for new coins is staggering, said James Benfield, executive director of the Coin Coalition, a Washington lobbying group that supports the dollar coin.
Mr. Benfield and others speculate that the glut is being compounded by the return of many coins to circulation after months or years on dresser tops and in shoe boxes.
But a spokeswoman for Coinstar, a company that operates 9,300 coin-changing machines in supermarkets, said the company was not seeing an increase in use of its machines.
The machines count a shopper's coins and exchange them, minus a service charge, for cash or groceries. Coinstar estimated that Americans have $7.7 billion in spare change at their homes.
For the mint, lower production means lower profits because it charges the Federal Reserve for the full face value of a coin, though it costs less to manufacture.
For example, it costs 4.5 cents to make a quarter, but the mint charges 25 cents. The mint sends the balance to the United States Treasury to pay for other government operations. But when demand drops, the mint has to cut costs just like a private company, leading to layoffs.
The mint, which also has operations in San Francisco; West Point, N.Y.; and Washington, plans to eliminate about 12 percent of its 2,861 employees.
Coins for Eastern states are made in Philadelphia; coins for the West are made in Denver.

HEADLINE: Mexico to Ignore A Trade Ruling 

BYLINE:  Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, Nov. 23 

 BODY:
The Mexican government said today that it would ignore a World Trade Organization ruling to lift duties on high fructose corn syrup, turning instead to the North American Free Trade Agreement to protect sugar producers. 
 A World Trade Organization panel ruled last month that Mexico broke trade laws by imposing tariffs of up to $176 a ton on corn syrup imports from United States companies like Archer Daniels Midland and Cargill. 
The panel said Mexico had not proved sufficient damage to local producers or shown how much the imports damaged local sugar producers. 
 By not lifting the duties, Mexico lays itself open to United States reprisals under the rules of the trade organization. However, Mexico is betting that the United States, its top trading partner, will allow it to use NAFTA rules to set new tariffs and to leave the current ones in place. 
The United States took the case to the W.T.O. after Mexico set the tariffs in 1998.

HEADLINE: Delta Town's Hopes Are as Scarce as Inmates 

BYLINE:  By PETER T. KILBORN 

DATELINE: TUTWILER, Miss., Nov. 21 

 BODY:
With all the jobs it promised upon opening less than two years ago, the $35 million Tallahatchie County Correctional Facility seemed the salvation of the flat and tattered Mississippi Delta town of Tutwiler, population 1,364. But the prison, encircled by cotton fields and shimmering coils of razor wire, has left the town little better off than it ever was.
 "Everybody thought it was going to help business," said Janie S. Downs, who is 82 and runs a gas station less than a mile away from the prison. "It didn't help anything." 
 Like hundreds of rural communities that have lost factories, farm jobs and population, Tutwiler, about 70 miles south of Memphis, looked for salvation in a prison. The one here can hold 1,104 medium-security inmates and employ 300 workers. These days, though, the prison houses 20 to 125 khaki-clothed men and women.
The concrete one- and two-story prison opened in April 2000 with 351 inmates -- all but 29 from Wisconsin -- and 208 workers. That is as far as it got.
In March and April this year, Wisconsin moved its inmates to prisons closer to home, leaving few inmates and a work force of 40. 
"How proud they were to have the facility in Tutwiler, to see their family working and have a trade so they could earn a good living," said Don Grant, warden of a prison 35 miles down Highway 49 in Greenwood and owned, like the one here, by the Corrections Corporation of America.
When the Wisconsin inmates left, said Sister Maureen Delaney, a Roman Catholic nun who manages a social services organization in town, "people said, 'We can't even keep a prison.' They said it in a joking manner, but there was pain in it, too." 
Tutwiler sits in the core of the Delta, one of the poorest parts of America. Built while a get-tough-on-crime philosophy led to inmate overcrowding and a construction boom, the prison here has fallen prey to developments that have stalled the growth in the numbers of men and women locked up in state and federal cells.
For eight years the nation's crime rate has declined. And as budgets tighten, many states are questioning the cost of incarceration -- like the $40 a day Wisconsin paid for each of its inmates here -- and the utility of locking up nonviolent offenders. After doubling in a decade, the number of state and federal prisoners steadied last year at about 1.4 million.
In recent months, at least seven states have postponed construction and openings of prisons. Michigan has closed one. Ohio, facing a budget deficit and a drop in the number of inmates to 44,700 from 49,000 in 1999, is "looking at the feasibility of closing one or two facilities," said a spokeswoman for the Ohio Department of Corrections.
Some prisons run by private companies are especially exposed. The Corrections Corporation, which owns or manages 70 prisons, closed one in Youngstown, Ohio, that it opened only three years ago after losing the inmate contract from the District of Columbia. The company has stopped construction of a nearly completed prison in Lumpkin, Ga., while another in McRae, Ga., has stood empty for more than a year.
Tutwiler, with a population that is 87 percent black, has roots in cotton and song. In 1903, W. C. Handy is said to have first heard the music he proclaimed the blues at the town's former railroad depot. "An unknown musician was singing while sliding a knife blade down the strings of his guitar," the inscription on a mural there reads. Aleck Miller, a harmonica player also known as Sonny Boy Williamson, is buried here. At his grave visitors have left harmonicas and a bottle of Canadian whiskey.
Except for cotton, there has never been much to Tutwiler's economy. People drive an hour to work in poultry and chicken processing plants for less than $7 an hour, or they work casinos in Tunica, an hour to the north, or at other Delta prisons. Tutwiler's mayor, Robert Grayson, is a guard at the state penitentiary in Parchman. 
Tutwiler has no drugstores, clothing stores or restaurants. Its grain elevator and bank closed last year. Rumors abound that the cotton gin at the edge of town will be next. 
Much of what sustains Tutwiler, where all the churches are Protestant, are the health and community services run by its seven sisters -- Catholic nuns -- and their staff.
The sisters maintain Aleck Miller's grave. They provide the site for town meetings and voting. A sister from Washington, Anne Brooks, is the area's only physician and director of the town's thriving health clinic. Sister Delaney, from California, directs outreach programs for children and the elderly. This month the sisters opened a gymnasium worthy of a university and paid for by faraway donors. 
With little beyond charity to keep Tutwiler afloat, community leaders chose three years ago to accept a prison. "We were sort of scraping the bottom of the barrel," said Otey Sherman, president of the county's Industrial Development Authority.
The city built a new water tower and sewage lagoon; the state and county agreed to pay half the cost of training prison guards. 
Then came the cuts. "People quit jobs somewhere else, got trained, started working for C.C.A. and then got laid off," Mr. Sherman said.
With three children at home, Elizabeth Martin, 31, had been unwilling to apply for the few jobs she could find because they were so far away. Last year, she got work as a prison guard. It paid $8.23 an hour, a good wage in the Delta. Her job was watching the grounds. "I went around in a truck with a gun," she said. Let go in April, she is still unemployed. 
Inside, the prison is a precision machine of motorized gates, surveillance cameras and control booths. With classrooms, a medical center and a six-hoop basketball gym, "it's a warden's dream," said Neva Yarbrough, the warden.
But entire cell blocks stand empty. The library has no books, the classrooms no chairs. Construction of the baseball field has been halted. 
The prison still helps the economy. It pays Tutwiler $5,350 a month for water and pays the county $600,000 a year in property taxes. But the payroll -- the money workers can spend -- has dropped to $80,000 a month from $467,000. 
The Corrections Corporation says it is beating the bushes for inmates. "Everybody is working to obtain a contract," Warden Yarbrough said. "We're going to get a contract." 
She had better be right, said Joseph Smith, president of the Tallahatchie County Ministerial Alliance, an association of Baptist ministers. "The only future we have," he said, "is getting that prison system open."

HEADLINE: Pataki Paints By Numbers To Create Dim Picture 

BYLINE:  By JAMES C. McKINLEY Jr. 

DATELINE: ALBANY, Nov. 23 

 BODY:
Gov. George E. Pataki has tried hard in recent days to paint a spectacularly bleak fiscal picture for New York State, saying that because of the Sept. 11 attack the state faces the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression.
 The governor and his top aides have repeated over and over that state tax revenues dropped off $1.3 billion from July through September, a 15 percent decline from the same quarter last year and the steepest quarterly decline since the 1960's, and that the loss in revenue this year and next could total $9 billion. The budget director, Carole E. Stone, said the damage to state revenues was "of a magnitude never before seen in this state." 
 But a review of the actual receipts and expenditures recorded in the state comptroller's office show that Mr. Pataki has exaggerated the problem somewhat. 
Over all, tax collections for the first seven months of the fiscal year are down about 2 percent, or $430 million, compared with last year. And since the governor let many city taxpayers postpone their September payments in light of the attack, it will not become clear until mid-December just how much revenue the state actually lost last quarter.
The governor, a Republican, might be forgiven a bit of hyperbole, for there is not only considerable truth in what he is saying, but a political strategy in saying it loudly and often.
Mr. Pataki, after all, is entering an election year, and how he publicly presents and politically tackles the economic crisis could be vital to his success.
For Mr. Pataki and the state, even flat revenue growth will mean politically unpopular cutbacks. But by painting an extremely dire picture, Mr. Pataki is setting himself up to play the role of the tough fiscal conservative riding to the state's rescue in a time of crisis. He could insulate himself somewhat from Democratic charges that he is in part to blame for the crisis because of his handling of budget negotiations.
The budget deal Mr. Pataki eventually negotiated with legislative leaders after the attack did not hold the line on spending, despite some reductions in service. It allowed a rise of about $4.4 billion, or 5.6 percent growth, to $84.3 billion. At the same time, Mr. Pataki's budget analysts now predict general state tax revenues will drop at least $2 billion from the $42 billion collected last year, a contention even the most sanguine Democrats say is quite possible.
That means that if spending from the state's general fund were to grow at the present rate, Mr. Pataki would have to deal with a shortfall of at least $4.3 billion in the next budget.
To make matters worse, Mr. Pataki's appeal to Congress to give him some money to offset state tax losses has apparently fallen on deaf ears.
The $9 billion in federal disaster aid Washington has already approved for New York will likely be earmarked for cleaning up and repairing the devastation in Lower Manhattan.
After his request received a cool reception in Washington last month, Mr. Pataki outlined a series of cutbacks to save about $1 billion over the next 18 months -- a hiring freeze, a buyout for senior state employees and refinancing some debt. He has also asked his department heads to come up with $2 billion more in savings, but those measures have yet to be spelled out.
Perhaps most distressing for the Pataki administration, however, is the loss of the annual surplus. Because of the previously booming economy and the administration's conservative revenue estimates, the governor has ended each of the last three years with a sizable cushion of unspent money. 
But budget officials, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said they feared that this year Mr. Pataki would have to spend most of theavailable $3.5 billion surplus to make up for the expected $2 billion drop in state tax revenues. That means Mr. Pataki, in his next budget, will have to close a multibillion-dollar gap with little or no surplus.
This is an executive's election-year nightmare. Because of built-in inflation in salaries, medical costs and school aid, the budget will grow on its own unless it is pruned.
Mr. Pataki's budget officials base their dire predictions on several factors. For starters, the national economy has ceased to grow and is now shrinking. In New York, several independent forecasts have suggested that the city will eventually lose about 100,000 jobs because of the terrorist attack.
So far, about 60,000 jobs have disappeared statewide between Sept. 1 and Oct. 31, the State Labor Department reports. New unemployment claims are up to about 25,000 a week, from about 12,000 a week before Sept. 11. The state cannot expect much from Wall Street either. The main securities industry trade group is now projecting that year-end bonuses for stock and bond traders will drop between 50 percent and 60 percent, which would translate into about $1 billion less in tax revenues than the state collected last year.
Capital gains on stock and bond trades are also expected to drop about 35 percent in the current bear market, according to the Congressional Budget Office and the United States Treasury. Capital gains accounted for about $60 billion in taxable income for the state last year. Finally, business taxes on Wall Street firms and taxes on tourists and hotels are expected to drop off markedly.
Even if these predictions turn out to be too pessimistic, Mr. Pataki faces politically difficult decisions in his budget for next year. The two biggest state expenses are for Medicaid and aid to local school districts, neither one of which a politician wants to cut just before an election.
His Democratic opponents for governor, State Comptroller H. Carl McCall and Andrew Cuomo, the former secretary of Housing and Urban Development, have already attacked the governor for the current year's spending plan. They have faulted him for a lack of "leadership," which in Albany means a subtle combination of arm-twisting, threats and deal-making to get one's way.
After six months of impasse and delay, the Democrats complain, the governor finally negotiated with legislative leaders a flawed budget that grew at twice the rate of inflation but still cut $150 million for environmental programs, added too little to school aid and shortchanged hundreds of charities that provide social services. This at a time when the reeling economy is impoverishing more people, putting more strain on the social safety net.
"This budget keeps the state running, but that's all," Mr. McCall said this week. "The bottom line is the budget was seven months late, acted on in the middle of the night with no public input, and fails to address the state's pressing needs, many of which have worsened in the wake of Sept. 11."
For his part, Mr. Pataki maintains that it was the stubborn refusal of Democrats in control of the Assembly to accept his economic predictions that produced the current budget. His aides like to point out that had Mr. Pataki given in to the demands of Assembly Democrats in April for $1.7 billion in additional school aid, the current budget would have grown even more and the cuts he would now have to make would be deeper. In addition, they say, had Mr. Pataki not built up the $3.5 billion surplus over the years, the state would be slashing programs now.
Finessing the fiscal disaster, then, will likely tax Mr. Pataki's formidable political skills. The key for the governor is to convince voters that the terror attacks and not his management are to blame for the crisis and to trumpet the idea that things could be worse had he not been so prudent for the last seven years.

HEADLINE: For Holiday Shoppers, Sale Is the Only Thing 

BYLINE:  By LESLIE KAUFMAN

 BODY:
Lured by sales and discounts, consumers kicked off the holiday shopping season and ventured to stores yesterday in most parts of the country with rekindled appetites. The potentially sparkling start to the season was dulled, however, by sluggish sales in the nation's shopping capital, New York, and by fear that consumer interest could be sustained only with profit-demolishing prices. 
 Post-Thanksgiving giveaways are now part of the holiday landscape. But this year retailers came into the season scared, and discounts are both widespread and deep. Roughly 15 percent more merchandise in stores is marked down than last year, according to John D. Morris, a retail analyst for Gerard Klauer Mattison, who keeps a sales rack index. 
 Economists and merchants alike are watching closely to see if American consumers will help pull the economy out of recession. Consumer spending accounts for about two-thirds of the nation's domestic output, and the holiday season is when consumers spend the most and have the greatest effect on economic growth. 
Though stores around the country were full yesterday, shoppers seemed focused on the ubiquitous sales, and many said they planned to spend less this year than last. 
Even those whose shopping bags were full seemed to strike a note of restraint. "We're trying to tone it down a little," said Barbara Ruane, of Annandale, N.J., who was buying a white hooded sweater for her daughter Megan, 18, at the Bridgewater Commons mall in Somerset County. This year, Mrs. Ruane said, she is buying only "things on sale and only things that everyone needs, nothing frivolous." 
Some who braved the lines before dawn said they were motivated by patriotism. "I want to go shopping to help the economy," said Steve Wood, 29, a sales representative from Colbert, Ga., who already had a shopping cart of toys at 6:15 a.m. at the Toys "R" Us store in Athens, Ga., including an Easy Bake Oven marked down to $9.99 from $19.99,
Still, most consumers were there because they sensed a deal. Judy Bannister of Boston's South End said she usually avoided stores on the day after Thanksgiving, but she could not resist an offer she saw on full-size comforters: $20 each. Yesterday she walked out of Macy's in Boston with four of them.
Edward Osgood, 49, of Bourne, Mass., who was waiting for his wife outside the same store, thought the bargains were so good that he felt compelled to point them out to passers-by. "Look, you pay a quarter, and you get $10," he said, pointing to a $10 off coupon for Macy's in a local newspaper. "I've got two of them."
The day after Thanksgiving is known as Black Friday because it is the start of the season that usually moves retailers from the red into the black. So it is a widely monitored gauge of the health of the retail industry in this make-or-break season. 
Predictions for holiday sales tended to be on the grim side. Some of the most optimistic predictions came from the National Retail Federation, which said apparel and general merchandise purchases -- everything from furniture to music CD's -- would increase as much as 3 percent. Others were decidedly less ebullient. The annual retail survey by American Express, for example, found that consumers planned to spend 7 percent less than last year.
In recent weeks, American consumers have received a lot of help in the pocketbook department. Fuel prices have dropped, low mortgage rates on houses have touched off a wave of refinancing, and the last of the federal tax rebate checks arrived. The question now is whether such gains will offset consumers' fears of layoffs.
"The customer has the means. What we are watching now is do they have the will," said Carl Steidtmann, chief economist at Deloitte Research, who remains pessimistic.
Certainly the state of the economy was on the minds of many shoppers yesterday. 
Anne Miller, 32, an occupational therapist and mother of two from Littleton, Colo., said that although she was not directly affected by layoffs, she was concerned about her husband's job in construction. "I was a little more reserved this year," she said. "I know what my limits are."
The obsession with the economy is not good news for New York, which is known for indulging the world's most cosmopolitan and well-heeled shoppers rather than the most cost-conscious. The terrorist attacks of Sept. 11 have devastated tourism, the source of much retail spending in the city, and layoffs on Wall Street are dampening the enthusiasm of other affluent shoppers.
The city's troubles are bad news for already embattled department store chains like Saks Fifth Avenue and Bloomingdale's, whose fortunes depend heavily on sales at their Manhattan stores.
There were markdowns in New York, of course. At Bloomingdale's, large rectangular red and black banners hanging from the ceiling announced savings of 20 to 50 percent throughout the store. Brooks Brothers, near Rockefeller Center, had an offer: buy one shirt and get a second one 40 percent off. At Kenneth Cole, customers were given 30 percent off and more on selected items -- a creamy brown leather jacket, normally $460, was reduced to $299.90. Still, the hordes of shoppers were nowhere to be found. 
"The New York business is really difficult," Michael Gould, the chief executive of Bloomingdale's, a division of Federated Department Stores, said with a sigh. "You still have the problem of the tourists not coming."
Denise Rivera, a Kenneth Cole sales associate, agreed. "This time last year I wouldn't have been able to talk to you," she told a reporter.
Kristy Lamont, 23, who was shepherding guests from out of town who had come in for the shopping, noted, "The city seems dead." 
If the department stores were taking it on the chin, discount stores were clearly benefiting in the cost-sensitive environment. The discounters were hot even in September, when most other retailers' sales were decimated in the aftermath of the terrorist attacks, and the discounters were still hot yesterday.
Although the big discount chains will not post sales numbers until Monday, their stores were full early yesterday as shoppers searched for toys like this year's holy grail, a Harry Potter Hogwarts castle, or electronics like the Olympus C-300 digital camera.
"The day started with a bang, and it continues to go strong," said Tom Williams, a spokesman for Wal-Mart Stores, which usually sells well in excess of $1 billion in merchandise the day after Thanksgiving alone.
In Florida, crowds even stood in the rain before dawn waiting for Target stores to open. "We've had big crowds lined up around the block everywhere," said Douglas Kline, a spokesman for Target, where, he said, shoppers were stuffing their baskets with traditional toys like Monopoly and Nutcracker Barbie.
Traffic has been down sharply at many malls this fall as shoppers stayed away in the wake of the Sept. 11 attacks. But for some shoppers, the desire for bargains trumped their fear of terrorism. Renee and Dan Stanton drove about 30 minutes to shop at the Park Meadows Mall in suburban Denver. Mrs. Stanton, who is five months pregnant, said she did have some anxiety about being in a mall.
"I thought, the day after Thanksgiving is so busy, it would be a day they would probably do something," she said. "But then I thought, 'What are they going to do, bomb every single mall in the world?' "
She added: "So I'll shop, but I won't fly."
The question in the remaining weeks of the holiday shopping season is whether the markdowns will entice people to put aside worries about the economy and spend more than last year.
Cindy Hayes, 34, from Englewood, Colo., who was at a Best Buy store outside Denver to pick up children's software for $3.99 and music CD's for $7.99, is emblematic of the challenge. "I'm hitting the sales in order to spend less," she said.

HEADLINE: The Arbiters Of Recession Stand Ready 

BYLINE:  By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER 

 BODY:
It's almost official: the economy is in recession, ending the longest uninterrupted expansion in American history.
 The official dating of the recession, the 10th since World War II, is expected to come as early as Monday from the National Bureau of Economic Research in Cambridge, Mass., long considered the arbiter of economic contractions and expansions. 
 The six members of the recession-dating committee discussed the issue in a conference call yesterday. The economists on the committee agreed not to talk about the decision, but an announcement is scheduled for Monday and a few now say that they think the economy is in a recession. They had indicated earlier that the most likely starting date for the recession is March. 
"My personal opinion is that a recession has begun," Jeffrey Frankel, an economist at the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard, said after the conference call. But he declined to say when he thought the recession had started or what the committee had decided.
But even before yesterday's discussion, some new economic data, including a surge in October retail sales and a decline in initial jobless claims, had led a number of forecasters to predict recently that the recession would be relatively mild and less severe than they thought earlier. This shift in attitude has helped push interest rates higher, as many investors are now behaving as if the Federal Reserve will soon stop cutting short-term interest rates so aggressively.
At the same time, stocks have rallied in anticipation of a recovery. The Dow Jones industrial average is up nearly 21 percent since its post-attack low on Sept. 21, while the Nasdaq composite index has jumped 33.7 percent since its low.
Still, many economists are convinced that the economy may remain bogged down for a while and that any recovery might also be relatively modest.
"There is some weakness left to come," said Richard Berner, chief United States economist at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter. He expects a 3.5 percent decline in the economy in this quarter, much sharper than the consensus view.
Americans have not experienced a single full quarter of contraction in the total economy since early in 1993, and then the dip was just 0.1 percent. The last recession, as the research bureau defines it, ended in March 1991 after starting in July 1990.
The official announcement of the latest recession will come as no surprise. Before the terrorist attack on Sept. 11, many economists already thought the economy was in a recession or on the verge of one. The attack and its aftermath made that opinion nearly unanimous.
The committee is expected to date the beginning of the recession as far back as March of this year, when the growth in employment, one of the research bureau's four main economic indicators, peaked. If that is the date, then the record expansion lasted almost exactly 10 years. If this recession ends in the second quarter of next year, which many economists are forecasting, then it will last about a year, average for recessions since the end of World War II.
The dating of recessions is always done cautiously. The research bureau's Business Cycle Dating Committee, as it is known, usually waits until it has at least six months of data beyond what the committee determines to be the onset of a recession. The dating of the start of the last recession was announced on April 25, 1991, more than a month after the recession was already over.
As a simple rule of thumb, many people define a recession as two quarters of consecutive decline in the gross domestic product. While not official, that rule has proved to be a pretty good barometer.
Based on the latest G.D.P. data, the economy fell in the July-to-September quarter at an annual rate of 0.4 percent. In the spring quarter, economic output grew at an annual rate of 0.3 percent, while in the first quarter, which ran from January to March, the economy grew at a 1.3 percent rate.
On average, economists polled by Bloomberg News expect the economy to contract at a rate of 0.8 percent in the current quarter.
The dating committee does not look at G.D.P. data because those data are quarterly, subject to major revisions, and because it dates recessions by the month. The four main indicators the panel considers are employment; personal income, minus government transfer payments like welfare; industrial production; and manufacturing and trade sales.
Before yesterday's meeting, the committee had indicated in its most recent analysis of current conditions that only personal income was still rising. Its other main indicators for determining a recession had already experienced declines similar to those in past recessions.
"The data continue to show substantial declines in real activity in manufacturing, the sector reflected in the industrial production index and in real manufacturing and trade sales," the committee said in a report on Nov. 9. "Aggregate employment has fallen substantially, as well, by about two-thirds of the amount typical of earlier recessions. Among the four indicators, only income has behaved differently from recession averages over the past seven months."
But in the end, Mr. Frankel noted, it all comes down to the collective judgment of the committee.
"There is no firm rule," he said.

HEADLINE: Parents Say Proposal for College-Preparatory School on Upper East Side Falls Short 

BYLINE:  By ANEMONA HARTOCOLLIS 

 BODY:
A group of Upper East Side parents who have been fighting for a college-preparatory high school in their neighborhood say the Board of Education is offering them a watered-down version they cannot accept, a high school that would have a weak curriculum and be open to students from outside the neighborhood. 
 The parents want a high school that would serve students who plan to go to college but who cannot get into New York City's examination-based high schools, and one that would be a natural transition from the neighborhood's elementary and middle schools, which have been rejuvenated in recent years. 
 Now, just as the Board of Education is to vote -- on Wednesday members have to approve a lease for the building, a former Sotheby's warehouse on East 76th Street -- the parents are urging board members to reject the school in its current form. 
They say their vision has been stolen away by board officials who believe a high school with strict neighborhood boundaries and a rigorous academic curriculum would be elitist and exclude minority students, since the Upper East Side is predominantly white. 
"We got used," said Jeanne Kassler, one of the leaders of the high school movement, called Partnership for an Upper East Side High School. "Nobody is willing to understand the underlying issues." 
She said the school proposal, as it now stands, calls for a curriculum in which students would study a small number of subjects in depth and be judged by portfolios of work. 
"I want to hear calculus, Latin, economics, I want a broad traditional curriculum," Ms. Kassler said. 
Students could apply for admission from all over District 2, which runs from the Upper East Side to the Battery and includes parts of the West Side, including TriBeCa and Chelsea. 
But Shelley Harwayne, superintendent of District 2, which would run the school, said the curriculum was still flexible and would be decided by parents, teachers and the principal. 
The school is expected to have about 500 students. Ms. Kassler said she calculated that it would admit only about eight students a year from the three Upper East Side ZIP codes. 
"I guess I'm just sick of the idea of being called 'elitist,' " Ms. Kassler said. "What am I trying to do, keep out TriBeCa? Keep out Chinatown? These are kids who are certainly matched in terms of demographics." 
"I want them to vote the school down," she added. 
At the same time, however, there is a split in the ranks of the parents, with some parents who previously supported the idea of an Upper East Side school now saying it would be a mistake to turn down the chance to start a new school, even if it served more than one neighborhood.
Clara Hemphill, an Upper East Side parent, sent a letter to the board pointing out that District 2 already runs other high schools with districtwide admissions. 
"I believe it would be unfair to permit Upper East Side children to apply to all schools in the district," Ms. Hemphill said, "while refusing to permit children from Chinatown, TriBeCa and Chelsea to apply to a new Upper East Side School." 
Ninfa Segarra, president of the Board of Education, said yesterday that Wednesday's vote concerns only the lease, not the educational or zoning plans, which must be approved at a later date. 
If the Board of Education votes against the lease, she said, the school could lose the building and could also lose a special capital budget allocation from the City Council and the mayor, to support the school. 
But Ms. Segarra said that she was sympathetic to the parents' complaints, and that she hoped the board and Chancellor Harold O. Levy would reconsider the curriculum and zoning of the school if the lease is approved. 
"I contend that when you have parents fight this hard to get the school, you try to make whatever adjustments are appropriate, " Ms. Segarra said. 
"I think it's a good thing that middle-class families wanted to create a public school and keep their kids in public school. 
"We did it in Riverdale," she said, "and we've done it in other parts of the city. The broader the base of support for the school system, the better." 
Ms. Segarra said it was predictable that District 2 would favor a school with a progressive curriculum that admits students from the entire district, because that is the way many of its schools are structured. 
One alternative to the current districtwide zoning, she said, would be for the Board of Education to take over the administration of the school. 
Anthony Shorris, a deputy chancellor, said yesterday that the discussion of zoning was premature, and that the important thing was to secure a lease for the building. If the lease is not approved, he said, the whole issue would become moot.

HEADLINE: Hard Times in Borough of Airports; 
As Airlines Cut Back, Queens Loses Jobs and Business

BYLINE:  By SARAH KERSHAW 

 BODY:
John Dupre, a mechanic for United Airlines, moved out of his apartment in Queens this month after his job at Kennedy International Airport was eliminated. The airline was transferring him to Indianapolis, and he said he had no choice but to go, leaving behind his friends and his favorite haunts on Metropolitan Avenue.
 "If I don't take Indianapolis, which I don't want, that means I'll get laid off," he said. 
 Mr. Dupre's departure has left his five roommates in Kew Gardens, flight attendants who have already lost two other roommates to airline layoffs, scrambling for replacements and doubting they can afford next month's rent. 
He is leaving a neighborhood that traditionally housed so many airline workers it was nicknamed "Crew Gardens," and where pizza parlors, dry cleaners and pubs may lose hundreds of customers by the time the airline industry completes a huge round of layoffs.
It is a story that can be heard in almost every corner of the borough as the industry's economic troubles, brought on by the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, ripple through Queens, home to two airports that are a major source of employment and are crucial to large corporations and tiny businesses alike.
The plane crash in Queens last week may chase away even more passengers. Economists and airline industry experts say, however, that it is too early to tell whether the crash, of American Airlines Flight 587 in Belle Harbor, will hurt the borough's job market the way the terrorist attacks have.
The job losses in the airline industry itself are expected to have a staggering effect on the borough, where more than 41,000 people work for airlines or other businesses at La Guardia and Kennedy Airports. Queens may lose 5,000 to 8,000 jobs because of cutbacks by the major airlines, according to the latest estimates. 
But those figures do not reflect the full impact of the airline industry's economic crisis on Queens. 
In addition to those 41,000 jobs -- most of them held by Queens residents -- there are 20,000 jobs in businesses that depend on air travel, like aviation fuel companies, travel agencies and parking lots. 
For every 1,000 air transport jobs lost in Queens, 470 in those related industries will go, too, according to the Queens County Overall Economic Development Corporation, which has been tracking the impact of the World Trade Center disaster on the borough's economy. 
That does not count the losses expected in still other industries that do travel-related business, like hotels and caterers for in-flight meals, which are expected to eliminate hundreds of jobs by the end of the year, according to recent estimates.
Food-service companies based in Queens that make meals for the airlines have already laid off 600 workers since Sept. 11, according to an analysis by the Fiscal Policy Institute, partly because meals have been cut from many domestic flights. The institute, a nonprofit research organization, also said that hotels were expected to eliminate 240 jobs by the end of the year.
"The whole outline has changed," said Marie S. Nahikian, the executive director of the Queens economic development group. "The ripple effect is going to be significant." 
In East Elmhurst, the Luggage Doctor Repair Center, a small business that repairs suitcases damaged by the airlines, has only half as many bags to mend.
Over in Flushing, Chocolates Unlimited lost a lucrative monthly order from a major airline company for employee gift baskets filled with chocolate-covered pretzels and caramels.
Miles away in Kew Gardens, the pizza shops that once delivered pies galore to pilots and flight attendants are taking hardly any calls from apartments -- known as "crash pads" -- that were once crammed with airline employees. Kew Gardens lies halfway between Kennedy and La Guardia Airports, and many airline employees share rental apartments there to be close to the airports they report to, even if they also live in other cities with their families. 
"It's been very bad," said Mike Bosco, the owner of Casa Bosco, a pizzeria on Metropolitan Avenue in Kew Gardens. "A lot of my customers from the airlines have been coming in to say goodbye, at least 20 in the last few weeks, and those were just the ones who said something."
While the air transport sector ranks fourth as an employer of Queens residents after retail, health care and manufacturing, no other industry in the borough is suffering losses as great as the airline sector's, economists and labor experts say.
The situation is the worst for businesses in the neighborhoods closest to the airports and most dependent on air travel.
The airline industry has announced reductions so far that would eliminate as many as 100,000 jobs nationwide.
The precise impact on Queens is still unknown because many of the layoffs are still coming, but officials with the New York State Department of Labor said this month that up to 8,000 air transport jobs could be lost in New York City, almost all of them in Queens.
Based on a survey of the airlines and labor unions, the Fiscal Policy Institute estimated that 5,000 air transport jobs in Queens would be eliminated by the end of this year.
Another study released this month, by the Center for an Urban Future, a public policy group, examined the impact of the airline industry's troubles on businesses like parking lots and in-flight caterers, and reported steep losses for many of them. 
The experience of Jim Sparro, the owner of Air Park, which operates two parking lots, one near Kennedy and the other near La Guardia, is typical for many of those businesses, according to the center's report and interviews with dozens of business owners across the borough. 
Mr. Sparro, who said he had parked 150 cars at each of his lots before Sept. 11, said he was now parking an average of 65 cars a day and had to apply for a small-business loan to pay his bills and stay open. He said that he had laid off 10 of his 30 employees and that the others were working an average of one day fewer a week. 
"We're pretty much taking it on the chin," Mr. Sparro said. He added that although business nearly disappeared altogether in the two weeks after the attacks, he had expected it to bounce back by now. 
Juan Carlos Lopez, who runs the Luggage Doctor with his father in East Elmhurst, near La Guardia, said that business was brisk before Sept. 11 and that the two were planning to double the size of their operation and move it near Kennedy.
"It was working well. We even had plans to move out and expand a little," said Mr. Lopez, who opened the business two years ago. "But everything had to stop, and we're just going to see what happens."

HEADLINE: With Ban Loosened, Some Small Aircraft Return to Manhattan Skies 

BYLINE:  By LYNETTE HOLLOWAY 

 BODY:
Helicopters and small airplanes, banned from flying over New York City since the Sept. 11 terrorist attack, are once again taking to the local skies, case by case. 
 After weeks of public complaints by business owners, the Federal Aviation Administration in recent weeks began granting waivers to its ban on small aircraft, including helicopters, from flying closer to the city than 18 nautical miles. A helicopter charter company said the ban was costing it hundreds of thousands of dollars in lost revenue. News agencies complained that it restricted their ability to cover stories. 
 Earlier in the week, a WABC-TV helicopter flew over parts of Manhattan, and on Thursday and again yesterday WPIX-TV had its copter in the air to tape the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade and deliver live traffic reports.
A spokeswoman for the F.A.A.'s eastern region, Arlene Salac, would not say why the agency began issuing the waivers.
The F.A.A.'s new guidelines call for flight towers within 18 nautical miles of Manhattan to track all aircraft by radar, Ms. Salac said. Most small carriers are licensed under so-called visual flight rules, which have patterns that are not tracked easily by radar. Under the regulations, which will remain in place indefinitely, pilots on small carriers are issued special radar codes so that air traffic controllers in the towers can identify them. The codes tell the name of the pilot and the destination. 
Small aircraft may not hover over bridges or traffic jams like in the past. 
Officials of Liberty Helicopters, one of the city's largest aerial tour companies, said that before it was granted a waiver about two weeks ago, business had fallen about 90 percent, forcing them to lay off an undisclosed number of workers. 
Although news of the waivers was greeted with relief by those whose businesses were hurt by the ban, there also appeared to be some confusion about the F.A.A. policy. Some flights face tighter restrictions than others.
A helicopter cameraman, Al Cerullo, who captures images of the Manhattan skyline for major films -- including "Six Degrees of Separation," "Armageddon" and "The Siege" -- said that he had lost about $200,000 in business. He added that he was not certain just what the waiver, which he learned about this week, would mean.
"I've made some calls," said Mr. Cerullo, who had not received clarification as of late yesterday. "I have a lot of questions, but it's hard to get answers. I am happy to have the waiver, although September and October are usually my busiest times of the year. It's always crisp and clean. It's always the nicest time to shoot. You don't have a lot of haze, and the city really looks golden, especially in the early morning and just when it's turning dark."
While helicopter tour companies and aerial filmmakers complain about the economic impact of the ban, news organizations had another complaint: restrictions on freedom of speech. 
"The F.A.A. severely restricted news reporting," said Barbara Cochran, president of the Radio-Television News Directors Association in Washington. "We're not sure if they were able to see that, but we are really glad to be back in the air, if even on a limited basis."
The news helicopter for WPIX-Channel 11 covered the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade on Thursday. The crew was so excited that members wore costumes. Robert C. Wilson, the cameraman, dressed as a turkey; Melinda Murphy, the reporter, dressed as a pilgrim; and Ray Rivera, the pilot, dressed as a Native American.
"It was like coming back to your house after you've been away for the summer," Mr. Wilson said.
While news helicopters just received waivers to fly, some tour companies received them several weeks ago, but they cannot fly directly over Manhattan, especially ground zero. They must show the city sites from the New Jersey side, said Alvin S. Trenk, president and chief executive of Liberty Helicopters, which operates from the 30th Street heliport. He said that his company used to conduct 100 tours a day before the attack. Now, he said, he is lucky if he conducts 10 or 12, and the tours are not even over the city. The average tour costs about $80 for up to 12 minutes.
The regulations have also had a major impact on Fortune 500 companies. Executives who used to be able to take a company helicopter across town at a moment's notice must now file flight plans. "We are hopeful that we can wait this out," said Matthew S. Zaccaro, a special advisor and past president of the Eastern Region Helicopter Council, a trade organization representing about 100 companies. "If there was ever a time when companies needed to use their aircraft, this is it."
Mr. Cerullo is not the only one in the film industry who is feeling the pinch. Even before the attack, the city had been whipsawed by a paucity of film production, because of the threat of a strike by Hollywood writers earlier this year. Although the writers settled before the strike deadline, most of the film production occurred in the city before June. 
Patricia Reed Scott, commissioner of the Mayor's Office of Film, Theatre, and Broadcasting, said she did not expect the city to reach the $2.5 billion the local film industry has earned annually in the past four years. But she does hope to see some major films come to the city early next year.
"We've looked into the pipeline and it looks good," Ms. Scott said.

HEADLINE: A NATION CHALLENGED: THE LEGAL FRONT; 
SPAIN SETS HURDLE FOR EXTRADITIONS

BYLINE:  By SAM DILLON with DONALD G. McNEIL Jr. 

DATELINE: MADRID, Nov. 23 

 BODY:
Spain will not extradite the eight men it has charged with complicity in the Sept. 11 attacks unless the United States agrees that they would be tried by a civilian court and not by the military tribunals envisioned by President Bush, Spanish officials said today.
 The officials said the United States was informed this week of the Spanish stance, and several experts predicted today that other countries in the 15-nation European Union would balk at handing prisoners over to the Americans without similar guarantees. 
 Mr. Bush's announcement that the United States could use emergency military courts in terrorism cases has stirred criticism in Europe, and the arrests last week in Spain of eight Islamic extremists could provide an early test of foreign cooperation with the administration.
"Military trials would be the worst of all possible worlds if you wanted to get people back from Europe," said Geoffrey Robertson, a British human rights lawyer. 
A senior European Union official who asked not to be identified said he doubted that any of the 15 nations -- all of which have renounced the death penalty and signed the European Convention on Human Rights -- would agree to extradition that involved the possibility of a military trial.
In Washington, a senior law enforcement official described the development today as "a setback." But the official said investigators were hopeful that Spanish investigators would share with the Americans any information about the eight Islamic extremists' dealings with the suspected ringleader of the Sept. 11 hijackings, Mohamed Atta.
Government officials and legal scholars interviewed today in London, Berlin, Paris and other European capitals cited a series of objections to the American tribunals that the president's Nov. 13 order would allow for foreigners charged with terrorism. The objections include the secret nature of the hearings, suspects' inability to choose their defense lawyers, and the potential bias of the United States officers who would sit as judges. 
The use of hearsay evidence, which would be allowed in the tribunals under Mr. Bush's order, would not trouble some European nations, but would raise hurdles in the United Kingdom and Ireland, where it is forbidden, the senior European Union official said.
"In Europe, we're very suspicious of special courts," said Marie Elisabeth Cartier, a professor of criminal justice at the University of Paris. "Everybody stands behind the U.S., and we understand that these events are exceptional. But we'd rather have normal procedure, one that is not military."
The United States has not yet lodged an extradition request. But a Spanish investigative judge, Baltasar Garzon, formally accused the eight Muslim defendants last Sunday of helping to prepare the attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon. 
If American law enforcement officials determine that the evidence backs Judge Garzon's accusations, the defendants would be subject to prosecution under American law.
In a meeting here on Wednesday between senior Spanish prosecutors and American diplomats, including a representative of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the prosecutors warned that any future American extradition request would run into trouble because a military tribunal would not meet European standards for judicial proceedings, one of the prosecutors said today in an interview.
"No country in Europe could extradite detainees to the United States if there were any chance they would be put before these military tribunals," said the prosecutor, who is helping to coordinate the criminal procedures against the eight men, whom prosecutors believe to be associates of Osama bin Laden.
A spokesman for Spain's Foreign Ministry confirmed the prosecutor's account today, saying Spain could extradite detainees only to countries that offer defendants the legal guarantees provided by Spanish courts.
"And if we're talking about a tribunal in the United States with summary procedures and military judges, then these are not the same conditions that would characterize a trial in Spain or France or England or anywhere else in Europe," the Foreign Ministry spokesman said. "Extradition would be impossible."
The law enforcement official in Washington said that Mr. Atta was believed to have made two visits to Spain this year, and that Washington was eager to know more about those trips.
"All we could get from the Spanish authorities is he rented a car each time and put 1,000 kilometers on the car each time," the official said, referring to 600 miles. "So we'd like to get a better idea of what he was doing in Spain, and who he met with."
The debate about the American tribunals comes as antiterrorism cooperation between the United States and the European authorities, especially in Spain and Germany, is accelerating. Three times this year, Spain has rounded up Arabs accused of preparing terrorist acts, and arrests have been made in Belgium, France, Britain and Germany. American law enforcement and intelligence officials have been working closely with their European counterparts, exchanging information that has advanced investigations on both sides of the Atlantic. 
The United States is used to negotiating certain conditions -- like promising that prosecutors will not seek the death penalty -- in order to extradite suspects in criminal and even in terrorist cases. In one recent case, the United States made such a promise to German officials to secure the extradition of Mamdouh Mahmud Salim, who now faces trial in New York on charges of charges of taking part in a terrorism conspiracy led by Mr. bin Laden. 
It is not known whether American officials would be prepared to promise that suspects extradited from Europe in the Sept. 11 attacks would not face the military tribunals mentioned by Mr. Bush.
The European Union already has a policy stating that no member nation must extradite a suspect to a country unless it gets believable assurances that the death penalty will not be asked for or applied.
So far, the extradition questions posed by the administration's plan appear to have been faced only in Spain, and have not been discussed formally by any European Union institution.
The issue appeared to take the officials of several European governments by surprise. Officials of the British, German, Dutch and Italian governments declined comment and the acting spokeswoman for the American Embassy in Madrid, did not return phone calls.
"We are just starting our reflection on this case," said a spokeswoman for the French Foreign Ministry. "We have no official position."
Germany has a long practice of extraditing to the United States in capital cases only if it receives assurances that conviction will not bring a death penalty, a legal expert at the German Max Planck Institute for Comparative Law said. Were the United States now to request extradition of a suspected terrorist, a German court would have to examine whether the proposed military trial in the United States would be "contrary to the rule of law."
"And that could be a problem," the German expert said.
Mr. Robertson, the British human rights lawyer, said the proposed American tribunals fell "far short of the fair trial standards" required by a key passage in the continent's basic legal affairs treaty, Article 6 of the Convention on Human Rights.
"Military officers in the pay of the U.S. government are not regarded as independent or impartial," he said, adding that European treaties require public, not secret, trials.
"In effect, there would be little or no chance of extraditing from Europe," Mr. Robertson said.

HEADLINE: 'Delicate Balance' Awaits Buyer of Brooks Brothers 

BYLINE:  By ALAN COWELL 

DATELINE: LONDON, Nov. 23 

 BODY:
Can the button-down set survive into the dress-down 21st century? The new owner of Brooks Brothers thinks it can.
 Marks & Spencer announced today that it was selling Brooks Brothers, the 175-year-old clothing chain, to Retail Brand Alliance Inc. of Enfield, Conn., for $225 million in cash. That is about a third of the $750 million that Marks & Spencer paid for the business in 1988. 
 Mark Shulman, the chief operating officer of the new owner, called Brooks Brothers' conservative styling and history as the United States' oldest retailer "an American icon." 
"It's certainly the classic look that we are going to maintain," Mr. Shulman said in a telephone interview. "The delicate balance is how you are going to revitalize the brand for the 21st-century customer without alienating the core customer."
Indeed, said Claudio Del Vecchio, Retail Brand's chief executive, who controls the privately held company, "the button-down older person will remain a Brooks Brothers customer, but the offerings in the store will still appeal to someone younger who works in Wall Street or a lawyer's office and needs to present himself in a particular way."
"It'll be an updated look," added Mr. Del Vecchio, 44, "but still traditional, and we still have a good opportunity to serve the same customer over the weekend as well as during the week."
Marks & Spencer, the onetime flagship of British Main Street retailing, sold Brooks Brothers for much less than the prices being talked about before the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks damaged prospects and chased away potential buyers.
The price "is somewhat lower than perhaps expected, but in light of Sept. 11, that's not surprising," said Matthew Taylor, an analyst at UBS Warburg in London. "Sales have fallen since Sept. 11, and a number of buyers that were interested before Sept. 11 have fallen away."
But as Marks & Spencer senses a recovery after three years in the doldrums, its main strategic goal has been to shed investments in Europe and in the United States, where the sale of Brooks Brothers is expected to be followed soon by the sale of its Kings supermarket chain, based in Parsippany, N.J.
"It was probably worth getting it done and dusted," Mr. Taylor said, particularly because investors would prefer to see Marks & Spencer make a deal rather than haggle over a price that is "just not seen as big potatoes."
The sale has refocused attention on Brooks Brothers' split identity as the custodian of conservative men's styling pressed by the changing times into offering casual and women's clothes. Casual clothing is a strong suit at Retail Brand Alliance, which already owns the Casual Corner women's apparel chain, with 1,000 stores, and has expanded into the women's jewelry and sportswear businesses.
"Our company is built around specialty stores," Mr. Shulman said. 
Its outlets cater, for instance, to women looking for smaller- and larger-size clothes in its Petite Sophisticate and August Max Woman chains. 
Highly acquisitive, Retail Brand Alliance also bought the Carolee Signature women's boutiques and plans to introduce a chain of 15 stores next fall under the Adrienne Vittadini designer name.
Mr. Shulman said Retail Brand Alliance had been considering an offer for Brooks Brothers since Marks & Spencer announced its plan to sell it eight months ago. Since then, Brooks Brothers has gone through rocky times.
Earlier this month, Brooks Brothers reported a first-half operating loss of $:800,000 ($1.1 million), in contrast to a profit of $:2.5 million in the period a year earlier. Marks & Spencer attributed the slump to the economic slowdown and the attacks on Sept. 11, which affected the flagship Brooks Brothers store in Lower Manhattan.
But there was a deeper problem. "This is a company that's been struggling for many years and is going to need a lot of work," Mr. Del Vecchio said in a phone interview.
As was the case with its British stores in recent years, Marks & Spencer never seemed to know precisely where to position Brooks Brothers. As it did in Europe with its own brand, Marks & Spencer rushed to expand Brooks Brothers, which has 80 stores and 72 outlets in the United States and 77 shops in Asia. That identity crisis meant that "they didn't gain new customers and lost some of their old ones," Mr. Del Vecchio said.
"Customers are a little confused about what Brooks Brothers means, and the No. 1 job will be to eliminate that confusion," he said.
Mr. Del Vecchio acquired Retail Brand Alliance after Luxottica S.p.A. of Italy, which is controlled by his father, bought the U.S. Shoe Corporation, which included Casual Corner. Luxottica, which owns Ray Ban eyewear and the Sunglass Hut chain, is based in Milan, and is not involved with Retail Brand Alliance, Mr. Shulman said.
Nonetheless, there were some questions today about whether Mr. Del Vecchio would turn an American emblem into an Italian name.
"I have been asked today: Do we want Brooks Brothers to remain an American icon or become an Italian brand?" Mr. Del Vecchio said. "And my answer has been that we see Brooks Brothers as a great international brand to appeal to Americans or Italians."

PERSON: Wendy J. Chamberlin 

HEADLINE: A NATION CHALLENGED: THE AMBASSADOR; 
U.S. Envoy to Pakistan Thrust Into Limelight

BYLINE:  By JOHN F. BURNS 

DATELINE: ISLAMABAD, Pakistan, Nov. 23 

 BODY:
Like so many other Americans, Wendy J. Chamberlin, the United States ambassador to Pakistan, found herself in a changed world on a late-summer day 10 weeks ago -- a world that transformed her, in an instant, from envoy to a country in a diplomatic deep freeze to occupant of one of America's most important ambassadorial postings.
 In the early evening of Sept. 11, as perfect a day in Islamabad as in New York, Ms. Chamberlin was walking from her office in the sprawling embassy complex to her residence. As she entered the marbled hallway, one of her two daughters, Chynna, 14, called from the television room upstairs, "Mummy, come here!" 
 More than nine hours westward, the first hijacked plane had struck the World Trade Center, and the second struck shortly after Ms. Chamberlin began watching. That it was terrorism was certain, and that it had momentous implications for the United States' strained relationship with Pakistan seemed just as clear -- at least to American officials like Ms. Chamberlin, 53, whose experience in counterterrorism made Osama bin Laden an immediate suspect.
"My personal objective when I got here in August was to work very hard to improve Pakistani-American relations, with the aim that at the end of my three years here we could lift American sanctions on Pakistan," Ms. Chamberlin said in a recent interview. "I could never have dreamed that we'd have accomplished it in my first three months."
For the role she has played in enlisting Pakistan's support for American military operations in Afghanistan, and rewarding Pakistan with an economic aid package that makes it the United States' third-most favored ally after Israel and Egypt, Ms. Chamberlin has been a figure of light and dark to Pakistanis: admired by those who favor Pakistan's move back to the American camp, disparaged as an "imperialist" by Islamic militants who support the Taliban.
But while the militants' hostility makes hers a potentially hazardous assignment, Ms. Chamberlin has remained highly visible, turning up for diplomatic events she could have avoided on security grounds.
The only ambassador in Islamabad who has cut a larger figure has been the Taliban's envoy, Mullah Abdul Salam Zaeef, whose daily news conferences mixed allegations of United States "genocide" with conflicting statements about the whereabouts of Mr. bin Laden. 
But Ms. Chamberlin, after fuming for weeks, eventually persuaded General Musharraf to ban the Taliban news conferences. This week, after more American pressure, the mullah was told to close his embassy for good -- a fate unlikely to win much sympathy from Ms. Chamberlin. "He told a pack of lies," she said. 
Since the Muslim holy month of Ramadan began last week, the ambassador has made another widely reported gesture, announcing that she will fast like devout Muslims from sunup to sundown each day for 30 days. "The whole point of Ramadan is to share the plight of the poor," she said. "I just felt, with so many Afghans facing famine, that I should show a sense of solidarity."
When Ms. Chamberlin arrived here this summer, Pakistan's relations with the United States were at their lowest ebb in 50 years. In 1998, under a civilian government, Pakistan conducted nuclear tests in retaliation for India's own tests. Both countries were subjected to severe American sanctions. In October 1999, after a military coup in Pakistan, even tougher American sanctions were applied. 
Pakistan's support for the Taliban, and by inference for Mr. bin Laden and the terrorist organization, only made things worse. 
One measure of the chill was that Ms. Chamberlin waited until Sept. 13, a month after her arrival, to present her credentials to President Pervez Musharraf, the general who heads the government. The official explanation was that August was too hot for the horses that draw the ceremonial carriage that bears new ambassadors to the presidential mansion. In earlier times, when Pakistan was a crucial cold war ally for Washington, a month's wait would have been unthinkable.
But from that first meeting with General Musharraf, everything changed. Since then, Ms. Chamberlin has seen the relationship thaw, to the point that Pakistan, denied all American aid for much of the last decade, has been promised $1 billion in economic support by the Bush administration. All American sanctions have been lifted.
Most remarkable has been the shift in American perceptions of General Musharraf. "He's my kind of man -- very direct, genuine and extremely personally honest," the ambassador said. Contrary to reports suggesting that the 58-year-old general wavered at first on switching Pakistan's support from the Taliban to the United States, she recalled him as having been firm from the moment the two first met after the Sept. 11 attacks. "He said 'yes' immediately, he said he was with us, and he said his support was 'unstinting,' " she said. 
America's report card was not always so approving. As recently as June, when General Musharraf appointed himself president, State Department officials all but mocked him for his grandiosity. And in March 2000, when President Bill Clinton stopped in Islamabad for six hours after a five-day trip to India, Pakistan's traditional foe, he lectured the Pakistani leader on democracy, and refused to be photographed with him. 
Although some Pakistanis chuckle at the American turnaround, others say Ms. Chamberlin has had the fortune to be ambassador at a moment when Washington, prompted by the attacks, has adopted a policy towards Pakistan that suits its long-term interests, if not wholly its democratic ideals. In this view, the American tilt towards India from the mid-1990's on underweighted long-term stresses between the two countries as much as it ignored long-term affinities between the United States and Pakistan.
In Ms. Chamberlin's view, much the same could be said for General Musharraf -- that Sept. 11 gave him an opening to shift Pakistan away from its tilt towards Islamic militancy and back to an embrace with the United States.
"I'd almost say he was liberated by Sept. 11, terrible as that Was," she said. "In so many ways, he's seen what happened as an opportunity to realize his vision for Pakistan: first, to put the country back on a stable financial footing; second, to use the new sources of financial assistance to address some of the important human development issues, such as education and job creation; and third, to tackle the corrosive effects of domestic terrorism."
Even if events have been more decisive than diplomatic skills in forging the new alliance, Ms. Chamberlin gets high marks from Pakistani officials for her part in the realignment. But embassy officials say that the hardest part of the job has been that Ms. Chamberlin, like other American diplomats here, was ordered to send her children back to the United States after Sept. 11 for security reasons.
Previously married to John Houston Hawes, a senior diplomat, she came here as a single mother, and will be separated from her daughters until Washington judges it safe for families to return.

Taliban Holdouts, Europe's Reservations and Anthrax Frustrations

BYLINE:  By CLYDE HABERMAN

 BODY:
 Down but not out. That seemed the simplest way to describe the Taliban in the complex arrangements under way to get their forces to surrender in Kunduz, the last northern city in Afghanistan that they hold. In fact, there were signs of new Taliban determination to carry on the struggle.

DIGGING IN -- If Pakistani intelligence officials are right, non-Afghan fighters for the Taliban were digging in near Kabul, the Afghan capital, and also at two locations outside Jalalabad, in the country's northeast. Rumors spread that Osama bin Laden was with them -- not near Kandahar in the south, as generally assumed, but in an area of jagged ridges called Tora Bora. It was hard to tell what to believe. But about 800 American Special Operations forces were said to be massed in Pakistan, ready to enter Afghanistan to find Mr. bin Laden and kill him.
 Most of the focus remained on Kunduz, where the talk was of a deal for a partial Taliban surrender. The hangup continued to be those foreign fighters, mainly Arabs and Pakistanis, who have vowed to fight to the death. Pakistan does not want to see its citizens killed en masse, and because it is a vital American ally in this war, its sensibilities have priority. Pakistani planes reportedly flew into Kunduz to get Pakistani fighters out of there.

EXTRADITION TENSION -- In tracking down the Sept. 11 attackers, the United States has worked closely with Western Europe. A good example of the cooperative spirit was Spain's arrest of eight Muslim men charged with helping to prepare the assaults on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon. But bringing those defendants to trial may strain American-European relations.
Spain told the Americans that it will not extradite the eight men unless Washington agrees to bring them before a civilian court, not the military tribunals that President Bush envisions. More than Spain is at issue. Concerns were also raised that other European Union countries would be unwilling to hand over prisoners without similar assurances from the Americans.
Europeans have long balked at extraditing criminal suspects who could face the death penalty in the United States. The planned tribunals create new points of possible friction. In Europe, they are widely seen as falling far short of fair trial standards as set forth in the European Convention on Human Rights. Thus far, the issue is somewhat academic in that the United States has yet to make an extradition request. But Washington was clearly not happy with this Spanish requisition. It was "a setback," a senior law enforcement official said.

ANTHRAX MYSTERIES -- In the United States, recent deaths from inhalation anthrax remained as worrisome, and as bewildering, as ever. Tests were done at the home of Ottilie W. Lundgren, the 94-year-old Connecticut woman who died this week. Ditto at two nearby postal facilities. But not a trace of the deadly bacteria was found. Nor do health investigators seem to have a clue as to how Kathy T. Nguyen of the Bronx caught the inhalation anthrax that killed her more than three weeks ago. In Washington, officials admitted to being surprised and disappointed by the lack of clues. That, the officials said, and one more thing: frustrated.

THE SHOPPING EFFORT -- Time was, way back on Sept. 10, when shopping meant spending money on oneself or on relatives and friends. Now shopping has been elevated almost to an act of patriotism by some Americans -- keeping life normal, not letting the terrorists win and all that. So extra close attention was paid to Black Friday, the day after Thanksgiving, the start of the season that will determine if retailers move from the red into the black.
Around the country, people did come out to shop. The not-so-good news was that they favored sharply discounted items unlikely to do much for stores' bottom lines. And in the nation's shopping capital, New York, business was discouragingly slow. Tourists, especially free-spending ones loved by the big department stores, remained relatively scarce.
Because consumer spending accounts for about two-thirds of the United States' domestic output, shoppers are important if the country is to pull out of the recession that is expected to be officially proclaimed on Monday. Some experts predict a fairly mild recession, however. The stock markets have reflected a certain optimism. The Dow Jones industrial average, 9,959.71 at week's end, stood 354.20 points higher than it did on Sept. 10. CLYDE HABERMAN

HEADLINE: Better Gas Mileage, Greater Security 

BYLINE:  By Robert F. Kennedy Jr.; Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is a lawyer for the Natural Resources Defense Council and president of the Waterkeeper Alliance.

 BODY:
It has become clear to most Americans that maintaining our national security will require reducing our dependence on foreign oil. But Republicans are using the current crisis to push through a reckless energy agenda, including drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, that will not improve America's security. Even the conservative Cato Institute has called President Bush's claim that Arctic oil would reduce gas prices or American dependency on foreign oil "not just nonsense, but nonsense on stilts."
 There is a clear and pragmatic way to reduce our dependency fast. Since 40 percent of the oil used by America fuels light trucks and cars, an increase in corporate average fuel economy standards -- called CAFE -- could have a dramatic impact. 
 In the late 1970's, President Jimmy Carter implemented CAFE standards to combat an oil shortage driven by policies of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries. The standards raised fuel efficiency in American cars by 7.6 miles a gallon over six years, causing oil imports from the Persian Gulf to fall by 87 percent. Our economy grew by 27 percent during that period. Detroit, predictably, figured out how to build more fuel-efficient cars largely without reductions in size, comfort or power.
The CAFE standards worked so well that they produced an oil glut by 1986. That's when the Reagan administration intervened to rescue America's domestic oil industry from gasoline price collapse. Ronald Reagan's rollback of CAFE standards caused America, in that year, to double oil imports from the Persian Gulf nations and to burn more oil than is in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.
According to a recent report by Amory Lovins of the Rocky Mountain Institute, if the United States had continued to conserve oil at the rate it did in the period from 1976 to 1985, it would no longer have needed Persian Gulf oil after 1985. Had we continued this wise course, we might not have had to fight the Persian Gulf war, and we would have insulated ourselves from price shocks in the international oil market. Fuel efficiency is a sound national energy policy, economic policy and foreign policy all wrapped into one. Every increase of one mile per gallon in auto fuel efficiency yields more oil than is in two Arctic National Wildlife Refuges. An improvement right now of 2.7 miles per gallon would eliminate our need for all Persian Gulf oil!
Yet the Republican Congress in 1995 made it illegal for the Environmental Protection Agency even to study higher CAFE standards. The result is that America now has the worst energy efficiency in 20 years.
If Congress is serious about ensuring our national security it should immediately pass legislation to raise fuel economy standards to 40 miles a gallon by 2012 and 55 by 2020. This would give automakers ample time to adjust their production. In the meantime, Congress should close the sport utility vehicle loophole by holding S.U.V.'s and minivans to the fuel economy standards for cars; automakers have the technology now to achieve this. Along with the other benefits, higher fuel economy standards could bring increased demand for efficient cars, leading to an increase in motor-vehicle-related jobs. We can also substantially cut gasoline consumption by requiring tire manufacturers to sell replacement tires that are as friction-free as tires on new cars.
We missed a huge opportunity in the 1980's and 1990's to increase our fuel efficiency. If overall energy conservation options available in 1989 were implemented today, each year we would save 54 times the oil that would have been used from the Arctic that year, at a fraction of the price of drilling there.
Mr. Bush's Energy Security Act will actually make us more dependent on foreign oil, and it will place our hopes for national energy security in an insecure pipeline that could even become a terrorist target. There is no reason to wait 10 years for Arctic oil to come on line when a small investment in conservation would quickly reduce American demand for oil.

HEADLINE: The Revival of Lower Manhattan 

 BODY:
Almost 11 weeks after the attack on downtown New York City, planning for the revival of Lower Manhattan has stalled. Gov. George Pataki and Mayor Rudolph Giuliani announced a new authority to oversee the area's restoration three weeks ago, but the directors of the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation have yet to be named. Restoration obviously cannot proceed until the site is cleared and vital transportation links are repaired, which will take many months. But it is not too early to assemble a core group of wise and creative minds to help chart the right course for this project and to ensure that the neighborhood that emerges from the tragedy of Sept. 11 is even more robust, imaginative and appealing than what went before. 
 There have been some understandable reasons for the delay. Mayor Giuliani, who is supposed to appoint three of the nine directors of the corporation, has been coping with another New York City tragedy, the crash of American Airlines Flight 587 in Queens. But the time for going slow is over, and the nine directors -- six others to be appointed by the governor -- should be chosen swiftly, preferably from as broad an array of first-rate urban leaders and thinkers as possible. This has to be a working board, not an honorary one composed of part-timers or political cronies. The stature and diversity of these appointments will reflect the importance that Albany and City Hall assign to the revival, not only of Lower Manhattan but of New York City itself. With little more than a month remaining in his term, Mr. Giuliani should defer to Mayor-elect Michael Bloomberg's views in selecting directors. 
 The corporation will have two main tasks. The first is to lend its authority to the mundane but vital job of infrastructure repair, including the restoration of basic utilities as well as rail and subway lines. It is mainly up to Mr. Pataki, Mr. Bloomberg and New York's Congressional delegation to ensure that the money that President Bush and Congress have promised New York for those purposes actually materializes in a timely manner. But it won't hurt if the new group adds authoritative voices to this chorus. Moreover, by its very presence, the new corporation will help reassure nervous businesses that even now are thinking of relocating elsewhere that somebody in authority is actively working on a vision of the future.
The corporation's second task is to create that vision. The original impulse among many people, an impulse born of anger and defiance, was to replicate the old financial center, twin towers and all. That has given way to a healthier vision of a more diverse and ultimately more energetic neighborhood. As always, it would have a strong commercial base, and would include not only financial giants but the smaller entrepreneurs as well. There would be a more robust residential presence than there is now. As added magnets for both new residents and tourists, there should also be a powerful cultural component -- a signature museum, perhaps, or a theater complex. Finally, the site must have a fitting memorial that allows the city and its visitors to honor the thousands who died there on Sept. 11.
As Mr. Bloomberg correctly noted the other day, Larry Silverstein, who leased the World Trade Center last summer, will be have a dominant voice in what happens on the towers' 16-acre footprint, not least because he will soon command billions of dollars in insurance money to rebuild the necessary office space. But it will be the new authority's job to steer Mr. Silverstein in the right direction, aesthetically speaking, and to make sure that whatever he does fits the city's larger needs and is linked to the surrounding neighborhoods of Battery Park, Chinatown, Little Italy and Soho.
These are uncertain days, but the speedy appointment of a respected city-state development corporation should bring some needed order and energy to the revival of Lower Manhattan.

HEADLINE: As Fiscal Engine Stalls, the Mechanics Line Up 

BYLINE:  By LOUIS UCHITELLE 

 BODY:
As Congress struggles to pass a stimulus package, a debate is breaking out among economists over whether the $75 billion to $100 billion that the House and Senate seem willing to spend will be enough to pull the economy out of its downturn.
 With a declaration expected as early as Monday that the economy is officially in recession, some experts talk about needing a fiscal stimulus package that starts at $100 billion and ranges up to $400 billion. Such thinking stands in contrast to the more common view that the current downturn will be relatively mild, requiring no more help than Congress is currently considering. 
 Those pushing for greater stimulus argue that consumers and business are pulling back on too many fronts and worry that the Federal Reserve's interest rate cuts will fail to reverse the decline. The government, they argue, must move quickly to make up the shortfall through a combination of public spending, subsidies and tax cuts. 
"Whatever is done has to be done fast," said Peter L. Bernstein, an economist and author, most recently, of "The Power of Gold" (John Wiley, 2000), who argues that Washington should inject at least $150 billion in fiscal stimulus into the economy, most of it through public spending.
Not since the early 1970's, when President Richard M. Nixon famously declared that everyone had become a believer in Keynesian pump-priming, has there been so much support for fiscal stimulus.
But how much? Those who say that less than $100 billion should be plenty to do the job argue that the current downturn will be mild and will almost certainly be over by early summer. Too big an infusion, they argue, would not only be unnecessary but potentially inflationary.
That is the view of President Bush's economic advisers, along with many other economists, mainly on Wall Street, who share the consensus forecast of a mild recession.
"So far, we do not see the need for much public spending at all," said R. Glenn Hubbard, chairman of President Bush's Council of Economic Advisers. "We do not think that this is a deep downturn."
The Republican-controlled House recently approved a stimulus bill that relies mainly on tax breaks to encourage private-sector spending and investment, an approach that Mr. Bush also favors, although his cost ceiling would be closer to $75 billion, not the House's $100 billion. The Democratic-controlled Senate, on the other hand, is considering legislation that relies much more on federal spending and subsidies than on tax benefits.
The pessimism that laces the thinking of many economists outside the consensus holds that the recessionary forces in the economy are much greater than the administration and most Wall Street forecasters realize.
"The kind of numbers we should be thinking about are certainly more than $100 billion and probably more than $150 billion," said Joseph E. Stiglitz, a Nobel Prize-winning economist at Columbia University who served as an economic adviser to President Bill Clinton.
"You have to think big numbers," Mr. Stiglitz said, "unless you believe that the economy will recover quickly or you think the Fed's monetary policy will be more effective than it has been."
Consumers and business, they argue, had made the boom years possible through an unsustainable process: record borrowing and robust spending while the federal government pulled back, eventually running up large surpluses.
Making matters worse, state and municipal governments are beginning to shrink spending as tax revenues fall sharply in a weak economy. Every state but Vermont is required by law to balance its budget.
"State tax revenues fell by 3.5 percent -- $5 billion -- in the third quarter, the first time these revenues have fallen rather than risen in the 10 years that we have collected data," said Donald Boyd, deputy director of the Center for the Study of the States in Albany.
"If this keeps up, the federal government will have to pump an additional $20 billion a year into the states just to keep spending even," Mr. Boyd added. "Many states have already ordered hiring freezes, and construction projects are being postponed all over the place."
Given such problems, the only solution, according to those challenging the conventional wisdom, is for the federal government to pick up the slack, by swinging rapidly from budget surpluses to budget deficits. Support for this approach is beginning to broaden beyond its usual liberal base.
Advocates say the most important thing is to direct money to those who will spend it, mainly through richer unemployment benefits, stepped up grants to the states, increases in military spending and bigger outlays for public works projects that can be undertaken quickly. School repair and highway maintenance fall into this category. 
"My view is that the federal government should spend a lot of money, and it will," said Paul A. Volcker, a former chairman of the Federal Reserve, declining to say how much might be necessary to lift the economy. "Tax cuts," he added, "do not make a lot of sense, either as tax policy or as short-run stimulus. They are doubly damned."
Like many economists, Mr. Volcker argues that tax cuts are too uncertain a spur. A tax break may not persuade a family to increase its spending if it is already deeply in debt, or persuade a hotel owner to hire more housekeepers if the hotel is half-empty.
Among economists sharing this view, James K. Galbraith of the University of Texas favors the greatest amount of spending.
"Normally in wartime, large-scale support to the domestic economy is not needed," Mr. Galbraith said. "But neither the $20 billion already appropriated for the military, nor the $20 billion allocated for relief and reconstruction in New York City nor the $15 billion passed out to the airlines is nearly enough to deal with the nation's economic problems."
He called for an increase in federal budget deficits from roughly zero today to the "breathtaking sum" of $400 billion to $600 billion a year, or 4 to 6 percent of gross domestic product. "Public spending -- let me disdain the public relations term 'investment' -- has a great macroeconomic advantage over tax cuts," he said recently.
Those who favor tax cuts, however, argue that permanent, across-the-board reductions in corporate and individual income taxes are a powerful incentive to spend and invest. According to this view, when entrepreneurs are allowed to keep more of what they earn, they are quicker to invest in new equipment, even when the economy is weak. The investment generates jobs, income and a willingness to spend, especially when tax cuts allow a family to keep more of its wages.
"People can look ahead and plan," said John Makin, an economist at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, "and if you are convinced that less tax burden is an incentive, then the economy, when it begins to recover, will have more legs."
By contrast, there is broad agreement among the advocates of spending that whatever the fiscal stimulus, it should be temporary, fading out as the economy revives. The advocates would include carefully aimed tax cuts in their plans; for example, a tax benefit for companies that step up investment, but only if they do so quickly.
"You want something that has a substantial kick in the next 6 months and is nearly entirely gone in 12 months," said Robert Greenstein, executive director of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. "You can always extend the stimulus if things go wrong."
At the top of most lists is the sweetening of unemployment benefits, which would add perhaps $30 billion or more to spending in a relatively short time. So would subsidizing health insurance premiums for unemployed workers who had lost company-paid benefits -- another popular proposal among many mainstream economists and Senate Democrats.
Even conservatives like William A. Niskanen, chairman of the libertarian Cato Institute, who prefers across-the-board tax cuts as the best prescription for the economy, would vote for stepped-up unemployment benefits and subsidized health insurance premiums -- if a financial package must be tried.
"If you are going to have a package," he said, "I would want across-the-board tax-rate reductions, and I would also be more than happy to increase unemployment insurance payments and pick up part of the payment for health insurance for people who are laid off and lose their coverage. That is not stimulus; that is helping people hurt by the weak economy."
Mr. Niskanen holds that consumer demand and a willingness to spend are latent in the economy and that people will respond as long as they are not so fearful that they simply shut down.
Mr. Galbraith disagrees. Household indebtedness has not yet reached the danger point, he says, but a crisis is approaching, one in which Americans will put more emphasis on saving than on spending. If that happens, government spending must rise simply to stabilize the economy.
"It becomes a question," he said, "of who does the borrowing and spending that will be necessary."

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS; 
Much Maneuvering Around German TV

BYLINE:  By EDMUND L. ANDREWS 

DATELINE: FRANKFURT, Nov. 23 

 BODY:
John C. Malone made his fortune in the United States by playing hardball in the cable television industry. Now he is trying to do it again in Germany.
 Mr. Malone, the chairman of Liberty Media Inc. in Denver, is buying six major cable television networks from Deutsche Telekom A.G. for $5 billion. But even as he seeks approval for the deal from German antitrust regulators, he appears to be trying to buy a stake in the company that holds crucial pay television rights here to Hollywood movies and major sports events. 
 The regulators are skeptical, and rival broadcasters are alarmed. But Mr. Malone is pushing hard, rattling companies with contradictory statements about his plans and lobbying government leaders up to and including Chancellor Gerhard Schroder.
A week ago, Mr. Malone let it be known that he was about to strike a deal to acquire a 22 percent stake in Premiere World, the pay television network owned by the Kirch Group. The stake is held by the News Corporation, which is controlled by Rupert Murdoch. But after meeting with Leo Kirch, the reclusive billionaire who controls the Kirch Group, Mr. Malone reversed course and said he was primarily interested in various forms of "cooperation" with Kirch.
That would have been confusing enough. But on the day that Mr. Malone was declaring his peaceful intentions, Liberty notified the German cartel office that it might be buying a stake in the pay TV network after all and asked the agency for its opinion of the plan.
Kirch executives make it clear they are baffled and suspicious about Mr. Malone's maneuvers, though they do not rule out a possible deal with him. Bertelsmann A.G., the media conglomerate that owns the European broadcaster RTL, told the cartel office this week that it was worried that Liberty Media would stifle competition if it was allowed to both operate a network and supply programming.
Industry executives here think that Mr. Malone is likely to run into trouble with the cartel office, Germany's equivalent of the Justice Department's antitrust division, even over his basic plan to buy the cable television networks. But many think Liberty is hoping to override the cartel office by winning a "ministerial approval" from Werner Muller, the minister of economics.
Last week, on the same day Mr. Malone held his seemingly friendly chat with Mr. Kirch, he also met with Chancellor Schroder in Berlin as well as with members of the German Parliament. The next day, he warmed the heart of Bavaria's powerful premier, Edmund Stoiber, by announcing that Liberty would set up its headquarters in Munich and eventually bring 10,000 new jobs to Germany.
But Mr. Malone can invoke more than charm. Deutsche Telekom, whose stock price has plunged because of weak profits and its huge investment in a new generation of wireless networks, is eager to shore up its balance sheet with cash from selling the cable systems. And because the German government remains the biggest shareholder in Deutsche Telekom, and is itself faced with a rapidly widening budget deficit, it has its own financial interests in seeing the deal go through.
Some cable television executives are puzzled about why Mr. Malone even wants a stake in the Kirch pay TV operations. Though the company does control invaluable pay television rights, it has been losing money and has been unable to build a big base of customers. 
Other cable operators in Germany, like Callahan Associates International, say they are entirely comfortable with negotiating distribution deals with Premiere. "We do not have a deal yet, but we will get one," said Chris McLaughlin, a spokesman for Callahan Associates in London.
One industry analyst noted today that Mr. Murdoch had hardly enjoyed a bonanza from his investment in Premiere. British Sky Broadcasting, the satellite broadcaster in which the News Corporation is the biggest shareholder, acquired a 22 percent stake in Premiere for stock and cash totaling 2.9 billion marks, or about $1.5 billion.
BSkyB has the right to sell that stake back to Kirch next October, and Mr. Murdoch has signaled that he is interested in doing so. That would create heartburn for Mr. Kirch, whose privately held company is thought to be struggling under a mountain of debt and might not be able to afford to buy the stake back. But Mr. Kirch seems to be equally worried that Mr. Malone and Liberty could put him in an even more difficult situation by controlling the access to 10 million German households.
Some industry executives speculate that Mr. Malone has little interest in buying the stake in Premiere and is merely angling for a better position in negotiations with the government. One executive, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said Mr. Malone might merely want something he can offer to give up in exchange for other concessions. 
"This is a diversion tactic," the executive said. "John doesn't need the stake in Premiere."
For example, Liberty Media is trying to buy local cable companies that actually run lines from streets into individual homes. Because of the way German cable television evolved, Deutsche Telekom's networks have direct lines to only a small minority of all households, and Mr. Malone recently reached a deal to acquire most of the systems owned by Tele Columbus, one of the biggest such operators.
Liberty executives, as well as those at Callahan who have bought other cable systems owned by Deutsche Telekom, say they must reach the end-customers if they are to make real profit on the business. But before they can buy the local operators, they need approval from the cartel office.
Liberty is also opposed to adopting an open standard for television set-top decoders that is favored by broadcasting regulators. That is a main reason that Bertelsmann's RTL as well as ARD, Germany's biggest publicly owned television network, are worried about the Liberty deal.
One industry analyst thinks Liberty may be interested in acquiring a stake in Premiere as well as other program providers. That, he noted, would fit perfectly with Mr. Malone's pattern when he built Tele-Communications Inc. and Liberty Media during the 1980's and 1990's.
"Look at the success he had building up TCI as a distribution network and Liberty as the content provider," he said. "I think he is trying to get deals in front of the authorities in order to get a feel as to what they are likely to say."

 FUTURELAND
By Walter Mosley.
356 pp. New York:
Aspect/Warner Books. $24.95.
 IN his new collection of short stories, the author of "Fearless Jones" and the Easy Rawlins mysteries combines cyberpunk, fantasy and the unsettling logic of dreams to create a startlingly inventive dystopia. These nine interwoven stories also neatly tap into our post-Sept. 11 fears and nightmares. In one story, terrorists employ biological warfare, and the United States comes under nuclear attack. Destitute New Yorkers live far underground, where they sleep in holes. It's a world of anarchy, political revolt and violence, set a generation hence, which eerily mirrors our own. 
Mosley, who is best known for his popular crime series, has written science fiction before, in his novel "Blue Light." Like his earlier work, "Futureland" brims with an acute awareness of history and social unrest. Beneath the high-tech gadgetry and noir atmosphere, the stories here are thoughtful explorations of race and identity.
"The Nig in Me" pairs gallows humor with social satire to contemplate the end of the world. Its description of an exodus, as New York City is under threat of nuclear destruction, is vividly realistic. Though the story is disturbing, the characters have a sense of sang-froid under fire. "Hurry up, man," says one, as he rouses a friend. "The world is almost over." 
While they try to flee from Manhattan, the country is in chaos. Neo-Nazi terrorists have plotted to destroy the black race, and their plan has backfired. As our hero, Harold Bottoms, discovers, "the disease was 100 percent fatal and everybody got it; everybody but people with at least 12.5 percent African Negro DNA." Harold, who is African-American, survives, only to be shot at by "so-called white men" with "a sizable portion of Negro blood in their veins." Though there are essentially no separate races left on earth, humans continue to hate one another. Equal parts wisdom and paranoia, the story is wittily relevant to the global crisis. 
"Futureland" examines the fault lines between creeds, colors and classes, unearthing the roots of resentment and rage. Several decades into the future, civilization remains radically divided, split into haves and have-nots. Conditions have worsened. The unemployed live in deep tunnels and never see daylight. Convicted criminals are imprisoned indefinitely, sedated and stripped of their citizenship. America is haunted by its past. 
In "Whispers in the Dark," an ex-convict named Chill Bent imagines he is "a slave who had slipped his chains, pried open the bars and outrun the dogs." Chill takes horribly desperate measures to help his small nephew. To pay for the gifted boy's education, he sells his own organs, becoming blind and paralyzed. It's not recognized as an astonishing act of heroism: "They all knew that poor men and women often sold pieces of themselves to the rich in order to give their children a chance." Chill's nephew grows up to be a genius -- a man with the highest I.Q. in recorded history. Here and elsewhere, Mosley probes the outer limits of humanity, its capacity for sacrifice, tenderness and barbarity.
What it means to be human is questioned in "Voices," a story about a highly educated addict who loses himself. For years, Leon Jones, a former history professor, has been consumed by a drug called Pulse. It engulfs the user in endless, mind-blowing fantasies and atrophies the brain. After Jones undergoes brain surgery to save his life, he hears a strange, persistent voice in his head and has a mysterious encounter with a little white girl named Tracie. Befriending her, he learns that she's a dream child or a ghost -- the dead girl who donated her brain cells to him. Neither his memories nor his thoughts are quite his own. Professor Jones is the kind of stereotype-breaking character Mosley's readers admire, a complicated and endearing underdog who prevails.
"Futureland" is populated by assassins and revolutionaries, and it is filled with suffering. Yet Mosley also peoples his stories with working stiffs and scrappy fighters. Against a bleak landscape, their resilient spirits feel like rays of hope.

 SPECIAL PROVIDENCE
American Foreign Policy
and How It Changed the World.
By Walter Russell Mead.
374 pp. New York:
A Century Foundation Book/
Alfred A. Knopf. $30.
 American foreign policy has long been the despair of theorists and systematizers. "Realists," who believe that international politics is an unremitting struggle for power, worry that the nation's leaders are often dangerously sentimental and naive. "Idealists," on the other hand, fret that the American public is ignorant, prone to violent outbursts and skeptical of dreams of perpetual peace. Observers of all stripes shake their heads at the seeming gyrations and inconsistencies in America's shifting approaches to the world.
And yet, somehow, the United States has managed to have an enormously successful career on the world stage. Over the course of little more than two centuries this country has grown from a small, weak cluster of former colonies to the wealthiest, mightiest, most influential nation on the face of the earth. How was this possible, especially given the lack of a clear American foreign policy doctrine? Could the answer be that, as Otto von Bismarck is alleged to have muttered, "God has a special providence for fools, drunks and the United States of America"?
According to Walter Russell Mead, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, the United States has indeed been blessed, although perhaps not quite in the way that Bismarck had in mind. In Mead's view, the key to America's success can be found in the very diversity and complexity of its multiple foreign policy traditions. Instead of rigidly reflecting a single theory or approach, American strategy has been shaped by the convergence of several distinct, and often competing, schools of thought. The end product is an evolving mixture rather than a pure substance; flexibility and resilience are its virtues, not simplicity or elegance. 
In "Special Providence," Mead identifies four distinct approaches to foreign policy, which he associates with four towering figures from America's past:
The followers of Alexander Hamilton have sought since Revolutionary times to foster the expansion of a vibrant national economy. They have worked to open foreign markets and ensure freedom of the seas, cultivating allies where necessary to build an "international legal and financial order" that permits "the broadest possible global trade in capital and goods." 
By contrast, the disciples of Woodrow Wilson strive to make the world safe for democracy. Mead sees Wilsonianism as the secular manifestation of a powerful American missionary impulse. Wilsonians hope to improve the human condition by spreading democratic self-governance and creating international institutions that will help prevent war.
Jeffersonians love liberty too, but they are more concerned with protecting it at home than with trying to promote it overseas. Indeed, they fear that the very instruments necessary to spread democracy (especially a big military, an activist federal government and the high taxes needed to pay for both) could pose threats to domestic political and economic freedoms.
Least understood, Mead says, are those he labels Jacksonians. These are the spiritual, if no longer merely the lineal, descendants of the Scottish-Irish immigrants who settled much of the Old West. Jacksonians are suspicious of elites; they are "instinctively democratic and populist." As regards foreign relations, Jacksonians are pessimistic about the prospects for lasting peace and skeptical of Wilsonian and Hamiltonian projects for constructing a stable world order. Supportive of a strong military establishment, they are nevertheless disinclined to use it unless absolutely necessary. Once provoked, however, the Jacksonians believe that America's enemies must be brought to their knees, if necessary through the application of overwhelming armed force.
The central chapters of "Special Providence" are devoted to an explication of each of these four schools. Mead is a clear and original thinker and an engaging writer, and these pages are filled with striking insights and pithy formulations. (Present-day suburban supporters of "big stick" diplomacy are labeled "crabgrass Jacksonians." Jeffersonians are the Stalinists of the American Revolution: "building democracy in one country is enough challenge for them.")
It is possible to quibble with some of Mead's categories, and to question how well real people actually fit into them. (Are neoconservatives like William Kristol and Robert Kagan, who advocate the use of American power to defeat foreign foes and spread democracy, right-wing Wilsonians, Jacksonians or some hybrid of the two?) Still, there can be no doubt that Mead's analysis is richer, more interesting and more accurate than those that pit "realists" against "idealists," "multilateralists" against "unilateralists" or "hawks" against "doves." 
On the secret of American success, Mead is somewhat less convincing. The author notes that vigorous competition among diverse views can lead to deadlock and drift, as well as to a constructive consensus, but he does not really explain why the second outcome has been so much more common than the first. Intellectual diversity alone cannot account for the rise of American power. Although they are mentioned briefly at several points, the nation's political institutions, its fortunate geographical location and its abundant material resources surely deserve more weight than they are given here.
And what of the future? Writing before Sept. 11, Mead worries that in the absence of a clear challenge, the United States might be unable to forge a new, durable strategic consensus. That challenge has now emerged; the consensus on how best to meet it has yet to be hammered out. A strong dose of Jacksonian toughness will no doubt be essential, buffered by a Jeffersonian sensitivity to wartime threats to domestic liberty. As in the past, Americans will not be content merely to defeat their enemies but will wish to see themselves as fighting for some higher goals: the overthrow of tyranny, the promulgation of democracy, the defense of a world open to the free movement of people, goods and ideas.
America's response to terrorism will be a blend of disparate elements. This book can help readers understand their origins, but it serves also as a useful reminder: the United States has faced stern tests before. There is no reason to fear that we have suddenly lost our special providence.

 THE FEAST OF THE GOAT
By Mario Vargas Llosa.
Translated by Edith Grossman.
404 pp. New York:
Farrar, Straus & Giroux. $25.
 Sympathy, or at least empathy, for the Devil seldom fails as a novelistic formula. Virtue may inspire, but evil fascinates. Most fascinating of all, perhaps, is political evil -- the sort of programmatic perfidy that doesn't just harm individuals but roils the flow of history itself. For all its richness as a subject, such large-scale wrongdoing rarely gets much play in the work of North American writers, who tend to favor stories of private crime over tales of public villainy. Recent events may change this cultural emphasis, but for now one has to look abroad, to talents such as Mario Vargas Llosa, the prolific Peruvian essayist and novelist, for the lowdown on organized evil in high places. 
"The Feast of the Goat" takes its title from the nickname for Gen. Rafael Trujillo, the dictator whose 30-year reign of terror in the Dominican Republic ended with his assassination in 1961. Trained by the Marines, and long an anti-Communist client of the American government, Trujillo became, in the last years of his life, an isolated pariah beneath the palms, harassed by bad press and economic sanctions. Like the younger Castro, whom the clean-cut, right-wing general despised, Trujillo encouraged a cult of personality that made him more than a simple head of state. The state was his body. Its limbs sprang from his trunk. 
And from his groin, if Vargas Llosa has it right. Though we meet him in the last hours of his life, old, embittered, ailing and besieged, Trujillo still fancies himself a sexual superman -- a Valentino with epaulettes and sidearms. In a country of legendary playboys like the inhumanly well-endowed Porfirio Rubirosa, Trujillo understands that power flows not from the point of a gun alone but from the tip of a phallus. He holds his subjects in an erotic spell. The women he beds -- mistresses, underlings' wives and random party girls procured for him by a former male model who also advises him on grooming and wardrobe -- are magical surrogates for the body politic. Therein lies the irony of his authority. Though he see himself as a soldier and a rationalist and regards the Haitians across the border as heathens to be purged and murdered, Trujillo is, at heart, a voodoo priest. The ritual penetration of female flesh is the mystical basis of his rule.
Assisting Trujillo is a cast of zombies that the author must have given himself nightmares raising from the crypt. By alternating fatherly affection with calculated silences, the dictator fosters a chronic, low-level panic among his spiritually gelded lackeys. The scariest is Col. Johnny Abbes Garcia, the Goat's intelligence chief, who dabbles in Rosicrucian hocus-pocus and claims to be able to read his victims' auras even as he burns them with lighted cigarettes and jolts them with voltage from an electric chair. Abbes Garcia is an archdemon of great refinement, a connoisseur of terror who prides himself on killing within a budget and on schedule. His henchmen scoot about the capital city in identical black Volkswagen Beetles -- a touch of macabre, comic genius. For Vargas Llosa, Abbes Garcia is the dictator's perfect psychic instrument, an externalized id. The pair's sinister duets, shot through with the uneasy familiarity of shrunken host and swollen parasite, are some of the book's most vivid, troubling scenes. 
The novel promises fireworks from the outset as the dictator's enemies load and point their guns, but the author is in no hurry to pull the trigger. He fills the pregnant pause with protocol -- the phone calls, meetings, meals and little ceremonies that, taken together, give power its shape and form. Trujillo is a creature of routine, maniacally fussy about his dress and hygiene. His government and his country may be a mess, simmering with intrigue and frustration, but, by buttoning his shirt just so, he's convinced that the chaos can be contained. Unfortunately for Trujillo, he's slipping physically: he can't control his bladder, and he's horrified. As one who identifies his personal regimens with the larger condition of his regime, he senses that disaster will come soon. When he wets himself during a formal luncheon, it's as though rebel commandos have stormed the palace.
Vargas Llosa fills in Trujillo's daily calendar with copious notes on modern Dominican history. The transitions from present to past are sometimes awkward. To provide an excuse for expository digressions, characters ask questions of one another that they already know the answers to. Dialogue segues into reminiscence, not always naturally. The most distracting of these excursions involves the present-day homecoming of one Urania Cabral, the daughter of a former Dominican senator who gave his all to Trujillo but then lost favor. Urania, who is now a lawyer in New York, left the country as a schoolgirl and has returned to visit her father's sickbed and get something big and mysterious off her chest. Her major revelation, when it comes, is a typical melodramatic shock having to do with sexual abuse, but it pales somewhat next to the novel's grisly scenes of dungeon interrogations and torture sessions. Talky, introverted and atmospheric, with lots of mediation and self-analysis, the Urania sections seem to be on loan from another sort of book.
But a story in motion tends to stay in motion, and the fundamental momentum of the tale instantly recovers from the small trip-ups. In this crackling translation by Edith Grossman, Vargas Llosa's Trujillo is a riveting creation -- a corked volcano of vulgar, self-pitying rage who demeans his aids with mocking nicknames (he calls the cerebral Cabral "Egghead" and refers to his alcoholic legal adviser as "the Constitutional Sot"). The foundation of his position, for Vargas Llosa, isn't simple ruthlessness, but his talent for provoking self-doubt in others. Trujillo is a Nietzschean vampire, sucking up others' wills into his own. Oppression is a transfusion; it takes two. Oddly, Vargas Llosa's Trujillo sees himself as having gotten the short end of the bargain. He whipped his pathetic homeland into shape, modernized its attitudes and highways and in return he got -- old. It's quite an insight. The tyrant must rationalize his rule with fantasies of self-sacrifice and victimhood.
The general's bloody end is never in doubt. The suspense comes from wondering who will fill his boots. When Trujillo falls, the novel revs up, burning supporting characters as fuel. The nation's designated liberator is Gen. Jose Rene Roman, whom the plotters are counting on to seize the reins but who, in a puzzling collapse of nerve, slips into a paralyzed passivity at the fateful moment. Roman's befuddlement is a masterstroke -- the nation's destiny is within his grasp, but his arms remain at his sides. They've atrophied, unaccustomed to acting on their own. Vargas Llosa shows that freedom begins in the soul; it can't be won with bullets. In another disaster, a hospitalized co-conspirator finds himself dreamily giving up comrades' names to a mesmerizing Abbes Garcia. Trujillo is dead, but his legacy lives on in his enemies' numb, evacuated spirits. 
An unlikely savior emerges from the sidelines. Joaquin Balaguer, Trujillo's puppet president, is the consummate faceless functionary -- a mild-mannered poet who's lurked about the story without ever making much of an impression. He goes from cipher to leader in a few pages -- a transformation of dazzling subtlety that has to be read twice to be appreciated. In a dictatorship, Vargas Llosa suggests, remaining self-possessed is the great challenge. While the fiery partisans combust around him, the calm Balaguer reassembles the republic. As a figure of the ideal politician, he's a curious case -- he lacks any discernible social vision and tolerates the crimes of right-wing goon squads rather than jeopardize his own position -- but it's clear that we're meant to admire him, in context. Balaguer is a room-temperature man, an antidote to the volatile Trujillo. In a country and a story swarming with villains, where even the antagonists have antagonists, pragmatism is akin to heroism.

 MEMOIRS
A Twentieth-Century Journey
in Science and Politics.
By Edward Teller
with Judith L. Shoolery.
Illustrated. 628 pp.
Cambridge, Mass.:
Perseus Publishing. $35.
 They have almost all departed, the remarkable men and women who discovered how to release nuclear energy and then applied that knowledge to build the formidable weapons that until Sept. 11 had kept us safe. Hans Bethe at Cornell and Edward Teller at California's Hoover Institution endure like Thomas Jefferson and John Adams, and such is their intellectual vitality that they continue even in their 90's to contribute to our continuing effort to understand the consequences of their work.
Edward Teller has published other memoirs, but none has been so comprehensive as this presumably final statement; appropriately, borrowing the phrase from his old friend and fellow Hungarian Leo Szilard, he calls it "my version of the facts." Sadly, if it sometimes enlarges and clarifies the historical record, it more frequently denies or distorts it.
Teller, born in 1908, remembers that he was an anxious child, with "an almost chronic bad conscience" and a "fear of the dark." He distracted himself from his fears with compulsive calculation; "finding the consistency of numbers is the first memory I have of feeling secure." It was security he would need in the difficult years of his childhood, when Hungary saw war, economic collapse, a Communist takeover and then, under Miklos Horthy, the first fascist regime in Europe.
Mathematics led to science, and by adolescence Teller had befriended three fellow Jews whose lives in science and politics would intersect with his for decades: Szilard, the theoretical physicist who first conceived the idea of a nuclear chain reaction; Eugene Wigner, also a theoretical physicist and a leader with Szilard in their 1939 project to warn Franklin Roosevelt through Albert Einstein about the dangers of a German atomic bomb; and John von Neumann, the gifted mathematician who became central to the development of the digital computer. All these men would contribute significantly to the Manhattan Project, Nazi anti-Semitism having driven them to emigrate from Germany to America.
Teller was thus on hand at the Carnegie Institution of Washington in January 1939 for one of the first demonstrations of nuclear fission, recently discovered in Berlin. He drove Szilard to visit Einstein at his summer residence on Long Island to compose the famous letter to Roosevelt. In 1942 he helped Robert Oppenheimer organize Los Alamos, where the first bombs would be designed and built. Before then, in the autumn of 1941, he recalls that Enrico Fermi had asked him "whether I thought that an atomic explosion might be used to produce a thermonuclear reaction." Teller, having concluded at first that a hydrogen bomb was impossible because the energy of the atomic explosion would rapidly disperse as X-rays, changed his mind the following summer, suspecting that the energy could be applied before it radiated away. In the event, X-radiation would prove crucial to making thermonuclear weapons work. From 1941 forward, Teller pursued a hydrogen bomb with his name on it.
At this point in the story, Teller's version of the facts begins to diverge from the versions of other participants. He says he remembers Oppenheimer discussing atomic bombs over dinner in Berkeley in 1942, when the secret project was well under way, with Haakon Chevalier, a professor of French who was later notoriously an intermediary in a Soviet espionage attempt. "I was not at all surprised or alarmed by the dinnertime exchange," Teller adds ingenuously, since it only consisted of "layman's generalities." He claims that Oppenheimer spoke contemptuously of Brig. Gen. Leslie R. Groves, the Manhattan Project commander, behind his back, and warned that after the war the scientific community would "have to do things differently and resist the military." The latter argument Teller says he rejected. "Oppie changed the subject immediately. I believe that the relationship between us changed at that instant . . . . The warmth of our conversation vanished and never returned." Unlike the memory of the rest of us, Teller's seems to improve with age; he did not recall these "facts" when their subjects were alive to rebut them.
Similarly, he claims that Niels Bohr -- who warned Churchill and Roosevelt that the atomic bomb would become a common danger and argued that they should begin negotiations for international control with Stalin before the bomb was used -- had proposed "sharing all of our knowledge with the Soviets," which is untrue. What Bohr proposed (international cooperation in developing nuclear science and nuclear energy in lieu of building bombs) was embodied in the Acheson-Lilienthal Plan that Oppenheimer and four other experts drafted in 1946; Teller says he considered the idea "the most attractive feature of the proposal." 
He acknowledges that the calculations he used to support his claim in 1946 in an official government report that his design for "the Super," a hydrogen bomb, would work were "flawed," but says his failure to check them was because of "the decision not to proceed with work" on the weapon. In fact, as he reveals, the American military was happy with atomic bombs in the late 1940's and uninterested in anything larger, nor did Teller himself volunteer to participate in the summer of 1949 when the Los Alamos Laboratory leadership proposed resuming work on thermonuclear weapons. 
The first Russian test of an atomic bomb in August 1949 reactivated Teller's old insecurities; he wrote to his physicist friend Maria Mayer that he felt "quite doubtful whether we can keep up with the Russians in the atomic race." With the encouragement of conservative colleagues, he began promoting thermonuclear development as the right answer to Joe 1, and he implies in this memoir that he believes his contribution was "crucial" to President Harry Truman's decision in January 1950 to accelerate work on a hydrogen bomb. Truman's decision was not technical, however, but military; the Joint Chiefs had told him forcefully "that the United States would be in an intolerable position if a possible enemy possessed the bomb and the United States did not," and that was good enough for him. A technical decision would have had to take into account the embarrassing fact that America did not know how to build the massive new weapon it was announcing to the world it would pursue.
Teller's version of the breakthrough to a two-stage thermonuclear weapon unsurprisingly denies any significant contribution from the Polish mathematician Stanislaw Ulam, who was co-author with Teller of the fundamental paper. Instead, Teller attributes the breakthrough to his infuriation with needling from Carson Mark, the head of the Los Alamos laboratory's theoretical division; it was Mark's insistence, he says, that led him to review his previous ideas. He claims to have found his mistake in December 1950: he had failed to realize that compressing the thermonuclear fuel was necessary for fusion reactions to proceed. 
The holidays passed; he observed atomic tests in Nevada; he discussed compression with von Neumann; and only then, he says, did Ulam approach him in January 1951 with his independently derived ideas ("far from original," Teller scoffs) of staging and compression. Truman had ordered a "crash program" to develop a hydrogen bomb; the Chinese had recently entered the Korean War; Teller had found the secret that had eluded him for 10 years; but he wishes us to believe that he kept silent for more than a month because Norris Bradbury, the director of the Los Alamos lab, had embargoed further discussion until after a test series scheduled for late April 1951. Well, Ulam had gone to Bradbury before he saw Teller. "He quickly grasped the possibilities," Ulam remembered, "and at once showed great interest in pursuing it." Teller's claim that he had already made the breakthrough simply isn't credible, nor did Carson Mark confirm it when he was alive.
More tortuous is Teller's explanation of his involvement in the 1954 hearing that removed Oppenheimer's security clearance. In order to sustain his version of the facts, he denies having made statements that appear in F.B.I. documents, legal depositions and even a letter in his own hand. He acknowledges that his testimony was damaging to Oppenheimer (in fact it destroyed him), but even all these years later he has no sympathy to spare; he complains instead of "the exile I was to undergo at the hands of my fellow physicists, akin to the shunning practiced by some religious groups. . . . I was more miserable than I had ever been before in my entire life." 
Curiously, Teller never seems to have understood the systematics of nuclear arms control. "We both preferred safeguards to simple trust when it came to international agreements," he says of Fermi, as if international treaties are negotiated without provision for inspection and enforcement. He opposed a nuclear test ban, he writes, because "the Soviets were at all times ahead of us in terms of the great numbers of weapons they had amassed," as if it mattered how many times either side could make the rubble bounce. Distrusting arms control, he began promoting missile defense in 1946, and was a major player behind the scenes in Ronald Reagan's Strategic Defense Initiative. It remains to be determined how much responsibility the missile defense mandarins bear for the nation's lack of protection against terrorist attacks, how much their glamorous and expensive high-tech visions distracted our leaders from practical home defenses.
"The cold war was unique," Teller concludes modestly. "It was won by the existence, not the use, of a new weapon, and without the loss of life." If Teller means the hydrogen bomb won the cold war, he's mistaken. Deterrence bought us time, but people desiring freedom and opportunity (in Poland and Eastern Europe and then in the Soviet Union itself) tore down the walls.
Personally charming, unquestionably brilliant, loving and generous to family and friends, Edward Teller approaches the end of a long career as a divisive force in American science and politics, someone who lent his scientific reputation to dangerous belligerencies that cost the nation lives and treasure but left it shockingly unprepared. About these realities his "Memoirs" are silent. "The private Hans Bethe is a different sort of man from the public one," he says accusingly about his old colleague, adding, "Perhaps the same can be said of me." Indeed it can.

HEADLINE: When Repair Shrinks Closet Space 

 BODY:
Q I live in a 40-year-old rent-stabilized building with 240 units. The closets in my apartment have accordion-type doors that reach from floor to ceiling and are nearly eight feet tall. Over the years, the doors and the mounting hardware have broken down and the doors are unrepairable. In other apartments, the owner has been replacing the original doors with louvered sliding doors that do not reach from floor to ceiling. (The top track is built down from the ceiling a foot or more, which results in the loss of important storage space in the closets.) I consider this unsatisfactory. 
 After I spoke with the building manager, he agreed to replace my existing doors with new floor-to-ceiling ones. After months of delay, however, I have received a letter stating that I must have the shorter doors installed. Is the landlord required to install replacement doors of equal size? . . . Bob Petit, Manhattan. 
 A "New York City tenants often find themselves in need of every square inch of space they can squeeze out of their apartments," said Jonathan H. Newman, a Manhattan landlord-tenant lawyer. "And when there has been a loss of a part of an apartment space, a tenant may be entitled to have his or her rent adjusted or prorated." 
Generally speaking, Mr. Newman said, either the courts or the Division of Housing and Community Renewal, the state agency that administers the rent laws, will determine whether a tenant is entitled to relief by examining both the landlord's reason for taking the space and whether the amount of space lost is significant.
"Another consideration would be whether the condition complained of by the tenant is de minimis in nature," he said. "That is, whether the new configuration of the closet and the accompanying loss of space significantly impair the tenant's use and enjoyment of the apartment."
Mr. Newman said that while the Rent Stabilization Code specifically addressed the loss of storage space provided as a buildingwide service -- and characterized that loss as de minimis -- it did not specifically address the loss of closet space inside an apartment. In one of the few reported cases on the issue, the state agency ruled that no rent reduction was warranted when linen closet space was cut to accommodate the installation of utility pipes.

Noisy Transformer Under Apartment
Q My wife and I live on the third floor of a co-op building in Fort Lee. Ever since we moved in, we have heard a humming noise in our apartment. The noise level does not violate the Fort Lee noise ordinance. Public Service Electric and Gas tested the noise and advised us that it was coming from a transformer in the basement of the building, directly under our windows. The company told us that if the co-op board consented, rubber mats could be placed under the transformers to deaden the noise. The board has refused, however, because this would require the electricity in building to be shut down for about three hours. Can we require the board to soundproof the room where the transformers are? . . . David Isaacson, Fort Lee, N.J.
A Felix Nihamin, a co-op lawyer who has offices in Hillsdale, N.J., said that the relationship between the co-op board and shareholders in the building was governed by the co-op's proprietary lease and bylaws. And in most cases, Mr. Nihamin said, the co-op board cannot be required to perform work in the building, including in common areas, unless there is a provision in the lease or bylaws making it do so. 
Since the co-op corporation is legally a landlord and the letter writer is legally a tenant, he said, it would be technically possible for the letter writer to bring an action against the co-op board for breach of the warranty of habitability if the noise from the transformer is deemed to be a nuisance. However, Mr. Nihamin said, since the letter writer indicates that the noise level does not violate the Fort Lee noise ordinance, it is not likely that the noise would be considered a nuisance.

HEADLINE: Selling Through the Slump 

BYLINE:  By Robb Mandelbaum 

 BODY:
 Rob Bohlen (right), Brighton, Mich.
Last year, Bohlen sold 887 properties for PreviewProperties.com.
"I tell people that now's the time. Interest rates haven't been lower in 30 years. If you're thinking about moving, do it now. The economy will get better, and rates will go back up, and you will have missed your chance. If you tell me you need to sell your home, I say, 'O.K., we need to make an adjustment because of where the economy is now, to make your price competitive, don't you agree?' I suggest that we drop the price 5 percent, and see if we can get ahead of people who are indecisive. Now here's the other half of the story: 'Your home's on the market for $225,000. We're gonna reduce that by 5 percent, $12,000, more or less. But now is also the time to move up, to a $400,000 house, say, and you'll pay 5 percent less for that. It costs you $12,000 to reduce your price, but you gain $20,000 when you buy the new one. So you're ahead $8,000.' A buyer's market becomes the seller's advantage."

Anhtuan Truong(left), San Jose, Calif.
Last year, Truong sold 1,240 cars for Piercey Toyota.
"Since Sept. 11, our business has dropped off about 20 percent. But back in August I could see it coming. We are in Silicon Valley, where a lot of people are laid off. Everywhere around us are empty company parking lots. So now I try to make every single deal I can. Before, if one person didn't buy, the next person would. I wouldn't force a sale. I'd say, 'Go out and look, then if you want, come back and talk to me some more.' Now, whoever comes in needs to buy a car. But in this economy people want something cheaper. Two days ago, I had a lady come in who wanted to buy a Toyota Avalon because her neighbor has one. So I showed her a Camry. I told her it costs her $5,000 less and will save her on gas and insurance. I just kept repeating the word 'save.' 'It will save you money today.' You don't want the customer to think it over. You want them to make a quick decision, to think, That's a good deal. That lady bought a Camry that same day. I'm on the dealer's side, sure, but making a sale now means doing the right thing."

Joseph Lino(right), Kansas City, Kan.
Last year, Lino sold 754 Electrolux vacuum cleaners, worth $610,000.
I haven't knocked on a door since 1996. Last year, I did 28 home shows, state fairs and mall shows. In my demo, I suck up pennies, so when they hit the metal inside of the Central Vac, it goes clangity, clank, clank, and everybody turns and looks. It's a real quick demo: show 'em the features, show 'em the top price, show 'em the show price, then give them a reason to buy today. Normally, I'll sell 30 or 40 Central Vacs at a weekend home show. But attendance at home shows is down 60 to 70 percent. I just did three shows in three weeks. At one of the shows, where I usually sell 10, I sold 2. At another where I usually sell 5, I sold none. And this last one in Omaha, where I usually sell 15, I sold 4. I hope I don't have to go back to going door to door. But I will if I have to. That's always been the best way, even back in the Depression. You have to get the product in front of the consumer. There are four objections: "I'm not interested," "I've got a good one," "I've got no money" and "I've got no time to look at it." If you're a salesman, you can overcome those objections, because buyers are liars. Everybody's in the market."

Last year, Mack sold $3.5 million in personal wardrobes for Bergdorf Goodman.
"The fall clothes are the most important clothes, and this September, of course, everything changed. Many of my clients were uncomfortable with the idea of shopping, or still are uncomfortable. Some have businesses that were already suffering, and then Sept. 11 came, and they've called me and said, 'I can't shop,' or 'I have to cancel this order.' But most people who called wanted to hear that it's O.K. to shop. This is a very psychological job. The most difficult customers come to a personal shopper, and now's a difficult time. My dressing rooms are set up for complete privacy. On the day after the attacks, a lot of people came in here who didn't have appointments, but didn't want to be alone. Nobody would let me close the doors between the dressing rooms. They wanted to be with people, to laugh a little about a silly pair of pants or whatever. It was the most interesting day I have ever spent in retailing. People who didn't know each other ended up hugging." interviews by Robb Mandelbaum

HEADLINE: THE WAY WE LIVE NOW: 11-25-01: On Language; 
The Arab Street

BYLINE:  By William Safire 

 BODY:
Peppered by questions from senators about why the Bush administration supported a Saudi monarchy that oppressed political or religious dissenters, Secretary of State Colin Powell gave a reply that struck many as puzzling: "Unto dust thou shalt return the day you stop representing the street." He explained, "When you don't have a free, democratic system, where the street is represented in the halls of the Legislature and in the executive branches of those governments, then they" -- the Saudi rulers -- have to be more concerned by the passions of the street."
 Members of PAW -- the Poetic Allusion Watch -- instantly caught the secretary's "unto dust" drift. The allusion was to Henry Wadsworth Longfellow's "Dust thou art to dust returnest,/Was not spoken of the soul." The poet, in turn, was referring to the passage in Genesis 3:19, "Dust thou art, and into dust shalt thou return," often cited on Ash Wednesday and at funerals. 
 Powell's message limited itself to the prayer's "dust to dust" portion. His import was that if a Saudi monarch were to go against the Arab street, he would soon find himself dead.
"Does this Arab street phrase refer to the person (or suicide bomber) in the street," asks Bianca Carter of Slingerlands, N.Y., "or is there a broader meaning?"
The street, from the Latin for "paved path," has many metaphoric senses. Financiers use it to mean Wall Street, the home of the New York Stock Exchange; those thrown out of work use on the street to mean "unemployed" (and in a recession, many in the Street are on the street). To those in prison, the street means "outside," the place to live in freedom. To those hunting for bargains, street becomes an attributive noun modifying price, meaning "what it actually is selling for, no matter what the price tag says." 
In political usage, to get to the point, the street began in 1831 as "the man in the street," or average person. In the 20th century, that meaning changed to "those demonstrating in the street." That sense spread to a more general "popular opinion" but often still carries a connotation of "the incendiary emotions of the mob."
First use of the Arab street I can find is in a December 1977 American Political Science Review. "The existence of nuclear weapons in the region," wrote Steven J. Rosen, "will induce moderation and a revolution of declining expectations in the Arab 'street."' Though it does not seem to be working out as Rosen hoped, the phrase he spotted caught on. A decade later, G. H. Jansen in The Los Angeles Times recalled that during the Suez crisis of 1956, " 'the Arab street' in every Arab capital pulsated with popular demonstrations." The quotation marks then disappeared as the phrase took hold in the language and gained complexity: 
"There was not one but many different Arab streets," wrote David Pollock in 1992. Prof. Samer Shehata of Georgetown agrees: "The term Arab street, which is not used in the Arab world, divides countries into just two factions, but it's much more complicated than the Arab street versus the authoritarian regime."
"The phrase used to be 'the Arab masses,' " recalls a Middle East expert who prefers to remain anonymous because he is passing along only an impression. "With the eclipse of the Soviet Union, that phrase disappeared because Arab masses has too much of a Marxist-Soviet-Communist tilt to it, and it was replaced by the Arab street."
Does the Arab street reflect popular opinion in the Arab world or just the opinion of extremists carrying banners and burning flags? Is there a silent majority that is not in agreement with demonstrators, as there often is in the West? Nobody can say for sure, but the phrase, as used by Secretary Powell, means "the opinions of people governed by an autocratic regime and unable to express their views through elected representatives."
It should not be confused with street Arab, a derogatory term for "urban vagabond, homeless urchin," as used in 1887 in Arthur Conan Doyle's first Sherlock Holmes tale: "I therefore organized my street Arab detective corps," which later evolved into fans styling themselves "the Baker Street Irregulars."

Ping!
From the highest reaches of The New York Times comes the query: "What does the verb ping mean, as in 'I'll ping him and ask'?"
At the same time, Microsoft Windows asked itself this question and sent my computer a copy: "What is the ping command and how is it used?"
Both senses are illustrated in this comment in Internet Magazine in May of this year: "In some offices, people are even sent to 'ping' the sales department to see if their figures are ready, just as networked computers 'ping' one another to see if they're still there."
"The ping command," Windows informs my machine, "is used to test whether a network connection is active." You send your ping and wait for a response from the pinged machine. From this we get a metaphoric extension: to ping a person, you send an e-mail message to see if your friend is alive and online. 
Do not believe the Internet dictionaries that treat the verb as an acronym for Packet Internet Groper, a Unix utility that accomplishes the above test but sounds to me like an odious new form of sexual harassment. The verb's e-mail meaning lies halfway between "to buzz" and "to noodge." 
The origin is not, as commonly believed, in the short, high-pitched pulsing sound emitted by sonar. Before that, ping signified the engine sound dreaded by motorists; if your engine pinged, you probably had piston problems. Before that, it was the sound of a bullet's ricochet: "If a button was shown," wrote a Sir James E. Alexander in 1835, "ping' went a bullet at it immediately." And before that, in 897, King Aelfred the Great, in his translation of St. Gregory's "Liber pastoralis curae," wrote in Old English, "He waerlice hine pynge mid sumum wordum," which means "Let him prick him very cautiously with some words. . . . " And before that, Roman noodges used the Latin pungere, "to prick, poke, urge." The same basic meaning echoes through the millennia.
If any deeper etymology is required, Arthur, don't ping me; I'll ping you.

Hard By Victoria Falls, No Flood of Tourists

BYLINE:  By RACHEL L. SWARNS 

DATELINE: VICTORIA FALLS, Zimbabwe 

 BODY:
THE horn wails and the luxury train lurches from the station in Pretoria, South Africa, and glides toward Zimbabwe and its glorious waterfall. The dining car bustles with tourists from Japan, Britain, Spain and the United States, who sup on crayfish and creme brulee. But the smiling waiters pouring champagne know all is not well on the famous Blue Train. This day in October, a season when the train is often booked solid, half of the 82 cabins are empty. 
 Despite government efforts to reassure the world that Zimbabwe is safe for travelers, the number of tourists visiting this country continues to slide as violent clashes between white farmers and black squatters make headlines. The terrorist attacks on the United States have only made matters worse, leaving many international travelers reluctant to fly. 
 The squatters, who have invaded hundreds of white-owned farms, have not attacked tourists. Popular places like Victoria Falls and the game parks remain largely untouched by unrest. Still, concern over the country's political troubles is devastating the tourism industry.
In the first five months of 2001, the number of tourists visiting Zimbabwe dropped by 24 percent, to 588,575 from 777,293 in the same period in 2000, the government's most recent statistics show. The slump follows last year's dismal season, after more than 30 people were killed before parliamentary elections. In 2000, the number of tourists dropped to 1.9 million, from 2.2 million in 1999, according to official figures. 
Over the last 18 months, at least 200 restaurants, tour companies and travel agencies have closed, officials say. "It has been a painful time, a painful time for everyone involved," said Amos Midzi, the chief executive of the Zimbabwe Tourism Authority, based in Harare.
The slump is particularly painful because the tourism industry had been growing so rapidly. Between 1995 and 1998, the number of overseas visitors more than doubled, to 504,064 from 231,130, as tourists from the United States, Canada and Europe flocked to the game parks, the magnificent waterfall here, Zimbabwe's modern, tree-lined cities and its soaring green mountains. 
The industry, which brought in $201 million in 1999, slumped to $124 million last year. Officials say bookings have fallen even more since Sept. 11.
"We've been very negatively affected," Leslie Gwindie, the spokesman for the Zimbabwe Tourism Authority, said of the attacks. "We can't quantify it yet, but we've seen a number of cancellations. But we are pressing on with our efforts. If we stop, we are finished."
Mr. Midzi says he believes tourists will return in numbers, particularly if political tensions ease after the presidential election expected, but not yet scheduled, next year. He and other officials already have begun to woo travelers.
Earlier this year, Zimbabwe opened a new international terminal in Harare, one of the most modern in southern Africa. In recent months, officials have traveled to Malaysia, Thailand and Indonesia, trying to market the country to audiences less exposed to the regular drumbeat of negative publicity. Officials have cut entrance fees to $5, from $20, at many of wildlife sanctuaries. 
"The situation is not as tragic as it is sometimes portrayed," Mr. Midzi said. "The service, everything is intact. Not a single tourist has been hurt."
In its most recent travel advisory, dated Aug. 1, the State Department notes that Americans have not been specifically targeted for violence here. But it says tourists should avoid Zimbabwe's farms, which have been occupied by blacks hoping to undo the legacy of British colonialism that left the white minority with more than half of the country's fertile land.
Travelers should avoid political rallies and be particularly careful around elections, the advisory says. It also warns that the country's economic woes might leave travelers in the lurch.
"Travelers are advised to reconfirm their lodging immediately prior to departure for Zimbabwe as numerous game reserves and lodges around the country have closed," the advisory says.
Shirley Skeeters, a retired interior decorator from Louisville, Ky., said she had heard all the warnings about Zimbabwe. But she was determined to see the country.
"We heard to stay away," said Ms. Skeeters, 65, who was riding the Blue Train to Victoria Falls with a friend in October. "But I said, 'It's a beautiful area, so why not go?' I had to see it for myself." 
The Blue Train, which is run by South Africa's transportation agency, Spoornet, threatened to pull out of Zimbabwe this year when the cash-strapped government here hiked the rates for use of the national rails. The two sides negotiated a compromise so the Blue Train could continue its monthly, four-night round trip from Pretoria to Victoria Falls (with two nights in Victoria Falls in between). Normally, the train averages about 75 percent capacity. These days, occupancy rates generally hover around 59 and 65 percent, officials say. 
"We see it as short term," Mike Asefovitz, a Blue Train spokesman, said of the drop in passengers. "Hopefully things will pick up pretty soon."

HEADLINE: Practical Traveler; 
To Europe, On the Cheap

BYLINE:  By SUSAN STELLIN; SUSAN STELLIN writes frequently for The New York Times.

 BODY:
DISCOUNT air fares to Europe this time of year are nothing new; fares to Europe usually drop markedly between November and mid-March, with some exceptions for the holidays around Christmas. But this fall, with trans-Atlantic travel in a slump, there are more seats available at these low fares and fewer time restrictions. 
 "The fare level that you see now is nothing totally out of the ordinary for November travel," said Einar Gustavsson, chairman of the European Travel Commission and director of the Icelandic Tourist Board. But, he said, there are fewer restrictions and fares are valid closer to Christmas. 
 Most major domestic airlines announced sales in late October that include round-trip fares to Europe under $400. Several international carriers have similar deals. 
Some routes and travel dates may no longer be available. In general, tickets to cities abroad must be bought by Dec. 4 for travel through March 20; the lowest fares usually apply Monday through Thursday and require a Saturday night stay and a 14-day advance purchase. 
Here is a roundup of typical fares from domestic and international carriers, plus some savings on ground travel. Only one fare includes taxes and surcharges, which may add another $30 to $50 to the ticket price. And most of the airlines are offering an additional 10 percent discount for booking online.

Discounts From U.S. Airlines
American Airlines, (800) 433-7300 or www.aa.com, is running a Great American Get-Together sale that includes discounts to many European cities. Round-trip fares from New York to London start at $238; other fares are Boston to Paris for $278 and Los Angeles to London for $338. 
United Airlines, (800) 241-6522 or www.ua.com, is having a Get Away for the Holidays sale, with round-trip fares starting at $298 from Chicago to London, $398 from San Francisco to Amsterdam, $278 from Boston to Paris and $238 from New York to London. Tickets must be bought seven days in advance. 
Delta Airlines, (800) 221-1212 or www.delta.com, has round-trip fares from Atlanta to Amsterdam starting at $377, Boston to London for $248, San Francisco to Madrid for $446 and New York to Milan for $308. These fares are valid for travel on any day of the week through March 14 (although they are not available for some flights from Dec. 14 to 24). 
Continental Airlines, (800) 523-3273 or www.continental.com, is having a Friends and Family sale with round-trip tickets from Newark to Paris starting at $278, Newark to London at $238, and San Francisco to Brussels at $406. 
US Airways, (800) 428-4322 or www.usair.com, and Northwest Airlines, (800) 225-2525 or www.nwa .com) are offering similar discounts. Last-minute travelers may find even better deals by subscribing to e-mail bulletins offered by these and several other airlines. The e-mail messages list highly discounted fares to selected domestic and international destinations, usually for the next weekend or within 10 days.

International Deals
Several European airlines are also offering discounted fares to Europe, in some cases matching the sales announced by U.S. carriers.
On Alitalia, (800) 223-5730 or www .alitalia.com), passengers can fly round trip from Boston or New York to Rome or Milan for $298 Monday through Thursday through March 14 ($25 more each way on the weekend). Tickets must be purchased by Dec. 4 and prices are higher for travel from Dec. 12 to 24. 
Air France, (800) 237-2747 or www .airfrance.com, has round-trip fares from New York or Boston to Paris (or five other cities in France) for as low as $278, for Monday through Thursday departures through March 16. Tickets must be purchased at least 14 days before departure but no later than Dec. 4. Air France has similarly discounted fares to other European cities, including London, Athens, Madrid and Brussels. 
On Lufthansa, (800) 399-5838 or www.lufthansa.com, a round-trip ticket between New York and Frankfurt is as low as $271; San Francisco to Paris is $426 and Washington to Amsterdam is $258. Tickets must be bought by Dec. 4 for travel through March 21. Lufthansa is also offering a free companion ticket to anyone who buys a round-trip economy class ticket by Feb. 15 for travel through March 24 (subject to some restrictions and blackout dates). A sample fare that qualifies for the "2 for 1" offer is a round trip from New York to Frankfurt for $546.73, including tax.
British Airways, (800) 247-9297 or www.britishairways.com) is also offering a free companion ticket to anyone who buys a full-fare economy ($1,366 for two between New York and London) or premium economy class ticket ($2,076) by Dec. 31 for travel by Jan. 31.

On the Ground
Americans in Europe can benefit from a strong dollar and a variety of discounts on hotel rooms, train travel and car rental. The European Travel Commission's Web site, www .visiteurope.com, lists a few offers from partners, including a 20 percent discount on car rentals from Hertz. The site also features three-night packages from British Airways Holidays, which include hotel and round-trip air fare to six European cities for as low as $390. (These packages must be booked by Nov. 30 for travel by Dec. 31, though prices are higher Dec. 19 to 23.) 
As for hotels, Mr. Gustavsson said that prices in Europe are about 25 percent lower this year than they would normally be. 
And for those interested in traveling by train, there are a handful of discounts available; all must be purchased in the United States before departure. BritRail (877) 677-1066 or www.britrail.net, is offering 25 percent discounts on passes for travel in Britain purchased and used by Feb. 28. A four-day BritRail FlexiPass, which can be used on any four days within two months, costs $176 for an adult in standard class and $262 in first class. Destination Europe Resources (800) 782-2424 or www .der.com, and Rail Europe (888) 382-7245 or www.raileurope.com, are offering discounts on the Eurostar train between London and Paris, and London and Brussels beginning in January. A leisure round-trip ticket between London and either Paris or Brussels is $178 when purchased 14 days in advance, or $120 when purchased 60 days in advance. These tickets are nonrefundable and cannot be exchanged. (The regular fare is $278.) Rail Europe is also discounting first-class French rail passes for two or more people traveling together through March 31. A first-class, four-day France Saverpass for two to five people is $147 a person, down from $201. 
Travelers who buy a Swiss Pass, (877) 456-7245 or on the Web at www.myswitzerland.com, can get an extra day at no extra cost before Dec. 31.

HEADLINE: If You're Thinking of Living In/Westerleigh, Staten Island; 
Where Flags Fly Outside Historic Homes

BYLINE:  By JANICE FIORAVANTE 

 BODY:
FLAGS have always been flown on American holidays on Burnside Avenue in the Westerleigh neighborhood of Staten Island, but since Sept. 11, more houses are flying flags supplied by one neighbor -- John Nappi, a 77-year-old veteran of World War II -- and they're out every day. "Driving down that block," said Michael Morrell, president of the Westerleigh Improvement Society, "makes you feel like you're in a procession."
 This is not surprising in a neighborhood that celebrates a holiday that it calls Patriotic Sunday, held annually on the last weekend in June at Westerleigh Park. The community comes together, listening to stirring marches played by the South Shore Band from Tottenville High School, picnicking and drinking birch beer provided by the Improvement Society, which has been in existence since 1893 and has 720 member families and businesses. 
 Westerleigh, which is on the north shore of Staten Island, was started in the 1880's by people fervent about temperance; three streets around the park are named after presidential candidates from the National Prohibition Party. Today, its residents are similarly passionate about their country, their neighborhood and their houses. 
When Mark Anderson, a historic preservation architect, moved with his wife, Nancy, and their 18-month-old son, Erik, into a 1903 turreted Victorian four-bedroom house in Westerleigh in June, he knew he was coming home -- in two senses: he had lived in the community until he was 4 years old and returned through the years to shop at the family's favorite delicatessen (the Westerleigh Deli) and bakery (the Cake Chef), and he is eager to bring his workplace skills to his turn-of-the century home. 
He also plans to write articles for the Westerleigh Improvement Society's newsletter to try to help other residents who may be working on their own century-old houses. "I look forward to including some of the technology we are using on restoring the landmarked interior of McKim, Mead & White's Gould Memorial Library at Bronx Community College for upcoming articles on stained glass and plaster restoration," said Mr. Anderson, a vice president at Facade Maintenance Design.
The Andersons like the neighborhood's mix of young families -- "there are five on my block with children under 5, including my own" -- middle-aged couples and older lifelong residents. "My next-door neighbor has lived on the block, Jewett Avenue, for over 50 years," he said.
THE community is brimming with historic houses, including at least one dating back to the 1700's: the Houseman Homestead, a New York City landmark, which is still used as a private home. But it is Victorian homes built from the 1880's to the 1920's that attract the most notice. Their original elements include chestnut trim, oak floors, wraparound porches at street level and small porches or balconies on the upper floors. Many of the homes contain parlors, libraries and formal dining rooms.
"What creates a neighborhood like Westerleigh are its non-cookie-cutter houses," said George Wonica, a Westerleigh native who owns Wonica Realtors. Housing built after 1920 includes Dutch colonials, Cape Cods and ranches.
The average prices for one-family detached homes range from $260,000 for a three-bedroom house built in 1925 to $369,900 for a four-bedroom home built in 1974 to $585,000 for an eight-bedroom house with a fireplace and in-ground pool built in 1931, according to Connie Profaci, owner and broker at Connie Profaci Realty. Two-family houses that sold recently include a five-bedroom built in 1925, which sold for $350,000, and a four-bedroom house built in 1970, whose price was $410,000.
Although about 95 percent of the buildable area was constructed before 1960 and, therefore, before the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge opened, there is still room here and there for some new building. Two semidetached homes have recently been built on Kingsley Avenue. Craig and Angela Recca and their two daughters -- Bianca, 9, and Priscilla, 12 -- have moved into one of them: 324 Kingsley Avenue, a three-bedroom, three-bathroom house with a finished basement that they purchased for $300,000. 
The girls attend St. Rita's Catholic Elementary School, which lies just outside of Westerleigh. Other private elementary schools in the area are Blessed Sacrament, a Roman Catholic school, and St. John's Lutheran School, both on Manor Road.
Many Westerleigh children receive their elementary schooling at Public School 30, a two-story school that was dedicated on April 28, 1905, with additions since. Of the 900 students at P.S. 30, 67 percent are reading at or above grade level and 66 percent are at or above grade level on the standardized math tests. This compares with the overall city scores of 34 percent at or above grade level for math and 39 percent for reading.
Robert Turetsky has been principal there for two years. "There's such a rich tradition here -- grandparents who attended the school come back to attend assembly programs," he said. "Enthusiasm and caring resonate throughout the building."
Students go on to attend Intermediate School 51, also known as the Edwin A. Markham School, named for a poet who resided in Westerleigh. In standardized reading tests, 39 percent of the 1,600 students at I.S. 51 are at or above grade level; in math, the number is 27 percent.
The school is coping with an abundance of students. "Our school was built for 1,100 students, so we are in double session, with the sixth and seventh grade starting at 7:40 a.m. and leaving at 2 p.m. and the eighth grade attending school from 9:15 a.m. to 3:27 p.m.," said Arnold Raffone, the principal. 
In a sign of the times, when his woodworking teacher retired and he could not find another, he hired Anthony Gargiso, who has a master's in photography; bought 15 digital cameras; and with 16 computers set up a photo lab. Today, 350 students take the digital photography course. 
At Port Richmond High School, with 2,500 students, 75 percent of recent graduates went on to four-year colleges and 4 percent to two year schools. About 375 students participate in the Collegiate Academy, an honors program -- students are required to maintain an 85 percent average -- with such advanced placement courses as calculus, government and economics. A sister program, College Now, lets students take college-level courses in subjects like communications and sociology at Kingsborough Community College in Brooklyn.
In sports, the girl's softball team won city championships the past two years, as well as in 1995 to 1997. "The team has been in the playoffs for 11 of the past 12 years," said the coach, Nancy Cena. 
WHILE most Westerleigh students attend Port Richmond High, about 25 percent go to Susan Wagner High School, which has 2,600 students; 70 percent of its graduating seniors went on to four-year colleges and 12 percent entered two-year schools. 
Among special programs at the school are the Scholars' Program, for honors students; the Odyssey Program, which works with ninth graders to ease the transition into high school; and a vocational program that helps special-education students find employment after graduation through part-time jobs while attending school. Nicole Klimuk, 19, daughter of Martha Klimuk, president of the P.T.A., is in the special ed program. Legally blind and neurologically impaired, Nicole works at Seaview Rehabilitation Hospital, visiting patients.
Westerleigh was originally called Prohibition Park. Beginning in 1887 it was carved from the existing farms and forests as a meeting place for supporters of the temperance movement. The National Prohibition Party purchased land in the area for its summer headquarters, setting aside lots for campsites. As the area's prominence grew, a permanent meeting site was erected: an auditorium called University Temple. To accommodate visitors, a large hotel and two small hotels were built. The area attracted William Jennings Bryan and other notables.
But by 1898, interest in temperance had begun to wane and the large hotel, Park Hotel, was torn down. P.S. 30 was built on the site. The Prohibition Park company turned to real estate, selling lots for houses to people who were not Prohibitionists. 
Most homes in the neighborhood are one-family detached houses, although there are some newer semidetached homes and limited development of town houses. One development is on Vogel Loop, opposite the firehouse on Jewett Avenue, which was built in 1988-89. Its 62 town houses were built on property where one large house stood. This mobilized the Improvement Society to call for lower-density zoning, and in 1989 the law was changed to allow only detached and semidetached homes to be built. The area has no condominium or co-op projects. But there is a garden apartment complex on Ravenhurst and Jewett Avenues, with rents ranging from $800 for a one-bedroom apartment to $1,100 for a two-bedroom.
Today, another "down zoning" is in the works. A proposal from the departing borough president, Guy Molinari, would rezone Westerleigh to be even more restrictive, , preventing semidetached developments and allowing only fully detached houses, one- and two-family, on 40-foot frontage. The application for rezoning is subject to approval by the Department of City Planning. The call for lower-density zoning is coming as more old large houses are seen as being at risk of being replaced by multifamily housing developments.
The commercial strips in the neighborhood run along its northern border, Forest Avenue, with its Forest Avenue Shoppers Town, which has a T. J. Maxx clothing store and a Hometown Buffet restaurant, and along its southern border, Victory Boulevard, with its Reiman's Hardware and Goodfellas pizza.
A focal point of the neighborhood is Westerleigh Park, a 2.9-acre square with a band shell that was refurbished in 1990. Another recreation area is the 4.2-acre Northerleigh Park, where the Westerleigh Little Guys and Gals little leagues play baseball. The private Westerleigh Tennis Club, which has a pavilion clubhouse and three clay courts, is on College Avenue. A one-year single membership costs $200.

FARMS, MINES, HOUSES: Before the temperance movement discovered Westerleigh, it was a mixture of farms, forests and mines. A thriving iron ore business, the Richmond Iron Mining Company, operated from 1864 to the mid-1880's. Twelve tons an hour were excavated by German and Irish laborers who used candlelight for illumination and earned $1 to $1.25 a day, according to "Westerleigh: The Town That Temperance Built," by Lawrence Dover, a hardcover book published last year through the Westerleigh Improvement Society with grants from local businesses. There were several iron mines occupying 66 acres. The ore had to be transported over cobblestones and dirt roads to barges at the foot of Port Richmond Avenue, directly north of Westerleigh. A railway was proposed to move the ore to market, but it was never built. The land proved more attractive for real estate development.

Analyzing Rental Market

 BODY:
Offering insights into the rental market, from what a landlord should pay for a pushbroom to the economic factors that make Manhattan different from the rest of the city, the New York City Rent Guidelines Board's annual publication, "Housing NYC: Rents, Markets and Trends 2001," is now available.
 "It's more than a clearinghouse of arcane information such as the price of pushbrooms and the change in the cost of boiler repairs, which is in there," said Anita Visser, executive director of the rent board. 
The 140-page book, Ms. Visser said, "is a comprehensive snapshot of the rental market: what it's like to develop, own, manage, live in and afford rental housing for the last year." The readership is diverse, she said: real estate professionals, academics, experts, lenders, housing advocates, policymakers. Readers could discover that the price index of operating costs, a measure of goods and services used by buildings, rose by 8.7 percent last year, Ms. Visser said, and "that we had a big spike in dwelling units completed during 2000, just under 13,000, or 44 percent more than the year before." 
 For the first time, the book separately surveys statistics for Manhattan below 96th Street. "Core Manhattan has a very different economic profile," Ms. Visser said, "so the study illustrates a tale of two cities." The book costs $23, not including tax and shipping.

HEADLINE: IN BUSINESS; 
A Struggle Over an Empty Store

BYLINE:  By DIANA MARSZALEK 

DATELINE: LARCHMONT 

 BODY:
CVS/PHARMACY is moving forward with its plans to open a third store here, despite opposition from neighbors who say they want a grocery store instead.
 Representatives of the Rhode Island-based pharmacy chain say they plan to turn the former Grand Union supermarket site in the heart of the village's commercial district into a CVS pharmacy unless a viable grocer gives them a better option. 
 Mike DeAngelis, a CVS spokesman, said company leaders were aware of neighbors' opposition to their plan -- especially after about 150 people showed up at a Village Hall meeting to voice their opposition last month.
Despite residents' demands for a grocery store, however, no viable food store has offered to absorb or share CVS's lease on the property, Mr. DeAngelis said. The lease to the Larchmont property was one of 10 that CVS obtained from Grand Union when the company closed its stores earlier this year. A CVS spokesman said the company filed its plans with the village last week. If the approval process goes smoothly, the store will open within four months. 
"We are certainly willing to talk to interested parties," said Mr. DeAngelis, adding that CVS remedied a similar situation in Woodstock by opening a store that shares its space with a grocery. "But right now in Larchmont it appears that we can't find anyone interested and it's just going to be a CVS."
Opponents of a CVS store say they will continue their own efforts to find a grocer for the site.
Larchmont and its neighboring communities, they say, already have more CVS outlets than they need. 
"We're not against CVS," Wendy Weinstein Karp, an opponent, said. "We shop there and we support it. But enough is enough."
She and others argue that there is a clear need for a full-service grocery store in the heart of Larchmont.
"It's vital to the health of any community to have a neighborhood supermarket," said Liz Feld, another opponent. "It's a social and cultural hub of a community."
Other area supermarkets are outside the center of Larchmont's village and are reached primarily by car.
Ms. Feld, who started a community group to bring new businesses to Larchmont, said she has already has talked to local grocers about leasing the Grand Union site. The owners of the nearby Larchmont Meateria, a small specialty butcher and food store, and DeCicco's Marketplace, a four-store business, are two of the grocers Ms. Feld said she wants to encourage to use the site.
But the owners of both the Meateria and DeCicco's said that while the idea sounds good, it may not be economically viable.
Joe DeCicco, a DeCicco's Marketplace co-owner, said that while the Grand Union site offers a prime location, taking over CVS's lease would cost about $15,000 a month for the 10,000-square-foot store, Mr. DeCicco said. That, along with stiff competition from area superstores that average 60,000 to 70,000 square feet, makes the Grand Union site a tough sell, he said.
"We love the idea, but when we checked the numbers out we realized it would take years to start showing a cash flow," Mr. DeCicco said. "This is not a profitable business."
The existing DeCicco's stores, which range from 7,500 to 22,000 square feet, have been able to make money because their rents are as low as $9,000 a month, Mr. DeCicco said. 
Victor Ciampi, owner of the Larchmont Meateria, agreed.
"Everyone would like to expand," Mr. Ciampi said. "But it's very expensive and very hard."
Village officials say there isn't much they can do to stop CVS from proceeding.
Mayor Cheryl W. Lewy said CVS was within its rights to use the site, as long as it goes through the village's approval process and complies with village law.
"The village's position has been the same all along," Ms. Lewy said. "The business district is zoned as a commercial area."
One village trustee, however, said there would be a range of factors for both the village and CVS to consider, which could influence the final decisionits outcome.
An issue that will inevitably arise is whether the village wants to continue letting the tenant of the former Grand Union site use the entire parking lot adjacent to the property, even though the village owns a portion of it, said the trustee, Ken Bialo.
The philosophical question of whether a CVS is the best use for the site -- the largest currently available in the village -- will also surely be discussed, he said. 
"We have a lot of agitated and angry residents and I'm sympathetic to that," Mr. Bialo said. "But it's also a matter of CVS's business judgment whether it makes sense to open a store that their own customers say they don't want."
In the meantime, CVS representatives said they would continue working toward a new Larchmont store.
"We are always willing to work with the community, but we are moving forward with obtaining the proper zoning and planning permits," Mr. DeAngelis said. "We see this site as an attractive location."

HEADLINE: Smoke Out: A Lesson Before Lighting Up 

BYLINE:  By ALIX BOYLE 

 BODY:
ANTHONY COVINGTON looked appalled and emphatically shook his head when asked by a visitor whether he smoked cigarettes. Anthony, a fifth-grader at the Harry A. Conte West Hills Magnet School in New Haven, is one of thousands of students across the state who is learning what tobacco can do to the body through a program called Science, Tobacco and You.
 During a recent science lesson, Anthony, 10, was using an interactive CD-ROM program to study how smoking burdens the heart, lungs and circulatory system. 
 "It makes me not want to smoke because you won't be able to get enough oxygen to breathe and you'll run slower," said Anthony, who also plays football.
Anthony and his classmates broke up into groups to conduct experiments like jogging in place and measuring heart rates. They learned that a smoker's heart rate will be higher and will take longer to return to normal than a nonsmoker's. 
"I have asthma and if I smoke it would be worse," said 10-year-old Breiana Stanley during a break from the heart-rate experiment.
The lesson is one part of a statewide effort to keep children from becoming smokers that includes a Web site, TobaccoFreeCT.com, spot checks of stores that sell cigarettes to be sure that they're not selling to minors, and education from science teachers and police officers. 
The Web site, a billboard campaign, and Science, Tobacco and You cost $1.25 million and were financed by a portion of Connecticut's share of money from the settlement of lawsuits against the tobacco industry, said Maraide Sullivan, project director of the anti-tobacco grant administered by the State Office of Policy and Management.
Despite all these efforts, children as young as 9 and even 8 are lighting up, said Suchitra Krishnan-Sarin, a psychologist and researcher with the Center for Nicotine and Tobacco Youth Research at Yale University School of Medicine. The Connecticut Youth Tobacco Survey released last spring by the State Department of Health reported that 13.1 percent of middle school students and 32.4 percent of high school students have used tobacco.
"Adolescent smoking is a huge problem and schools are doing the best they can with prevention and education programs, but there are really no good cessation programs out there in the schools," Ms. Krishnan-Sarin said.
According to the TobbaccoFreeCT.com Web site, smoking is prohibited in all areas of public school buildings, without exception, while school is in session or student activities are taking place. Students are suspended if they are caught smoking and the police are often called to issue a ticket to a student who smokes at school, Dr. Krishnan-Sarin said.
"It's O.K. to suspend a student, but that alone is not sufficient," Dr. Krishnan-Sarin said. "We need to provide treatment options. You have to take into consideration that they are addicted and they need help."
Part of the problem is that nicotine substitutes like patches and gum are generally not available to children and adolescents who smoke. Adult cessation programs don't work well with teenagers, so new methods must be developed.
"I believe that cessation programs haven't been successful because people have jumped into programs without understanding the science," Dr. Krishnan-Sarin said.
Why do teenagers smoke? Mainly as a coping mechanism to deal with school and home stress, and they continue smoking because they are addicted to nicotine.
Why do they start? Peer influence and because their parents smoke. Parents who smoke are more likely to tolerate it in their children.
In her research over the years, Dr. Krishnan-Sarin has learned that three out of four teenagers have tried to quit more than once and that two out of three teenagers who smoke wish they had never started.
Researchers at Yale recruit teenagers who want to quit smoking to a three-day in-patient hospital program. The researchers study the smokers' mood and cognitive changes. With this knowledge, future smoking cessation programs can be tailored to the teens' needs.
According to the state youth tobacco survey, middle school students get their cigarettes by borrowing them or having someone else buy them. Teenagers buy cigarettes at convenience stores and from vending machines. 
It is illegal to buy tobacco if you are under 18 and it is illegal to sell it to minors. The state has been fining stores if they sell cigarettes to children. Children can also be fined $50 on their first offense and $100 thereafter.
"Federal law requires that states enforce the tobacco laws by doing random unannounced inspections," said State Senator William A. Aniskovich, a Republican from Branford. "If we don't, we will lose our federal block grants for substance-abuse services. Back in 1996, Connecticut had one of the worst compliance rates, but that's improved substantially."
Not only is it illegal to sell tobacco to minors, but owners of vending machines can be fined if anyone under 18 is caught buying cigarettes from their machines. Selling "loosies," cigarettes out of the package, is also illegal.
"Our culture is uncomfortable with stricter enforcement of tobacco laws because many people believe that this is still in the purview of parents," Mr. Aniskovich said. "But even parents who care don't know what their children are doing every minute and there is still a need for enforcement. It's a public health issue like requiring people to wear bike helmets. It gives parents one more tool and enables them to say, 'It's the law.' " 
State Attorney General Richard Blumenthal said that in spot inspections, minors were able to buy cigarettes 70 percent of the time in 1996; it was reduced to 18 percent in 2000. 
Last year the State Legislature passed a law allowing towns to ban vending machines and so far, Orange has succeeded in banning them. Mr. Blumenthal supports all towns getting rid of vending machines. However, a bill banning smoking in public buildings failed, but will be redrafted next year, Mr. Aniskovich said.
Mr. Blumenthal's office recently sued R. J. Reynolds for continuing to advertise in magazines that appeal to teenagers in violation of the original tobacco settlement, he said. Mr. Blumenthal said that Connecticut was one of the first states to file suit against the tobacco companies.
About 1,200 teachers were trained in the Science, Tobacco and You tobacco curriculum last year, Ms. Sullivan said. The use of the curriculum varies from school to school, but teachers give from 12 to 20 one-hour lessons on the effects of tobacco.
Jo-Anne Escandon, a fourth grade teacher at Race Brook School in Orange said that her class was particularly impressed when they saw the tar that was pulled out of a lung during an autopsy. Ms. Escandon also has her pupils write letters to parents or grandparents, imploring them to stop smoking. As a result, one of the mothers of a student quit smoking.
"We target the children in fourth and fifth grade before they develop bad habits," Ms. Escandon said. "Once they do their experiments, they say 'I'm never going to smoke.' "
Some parents, however, said they believed that the anti-smoking campaign begins at home. Jessica Shore of Guilford said that her twin boys view smoking as unhealthy and disgusting. Although she taught Ethan and Gabriel, both 10, that smoking is addictive, harmful and would interfere with playing sports, she believes that her example of not smoking is the strongest message of all.
"I think it's not what you say, it's what you do," Ms. Shore said. "If you smoke, you're sunk."

HEADLINE: Conservation-Minded Housing in Indiana 

BYLINE:  By KEITH SCHNEIDER

DATELINE: MICHIGAN CITY, Ind. 

 BODY:
The story of American housing development is told in lyrical names -- Golden Meadows, Redgrove Orchards, Wildwood Acres -- that are usually the sole remnant of what was wiped off the land once the sewers, roads and houses were built.
 That is not true, however, at the 170-acre Tryon Farm, an environmentally sensitive farm-based development in northwest Indiana that takes advantage of a growing demand for community, kinship and distinctive homes amid wide-open natural spaces. Tryon Farm, at the eastern edge of Michigan City, a rust-belt town experiencing an economic revival, is also distinguished by a novel business plan that is satisfied with a much slower home construction and sales pace than conventional subdivisions. 
 That's due in part to the fact that Tryon Farm is really a family enterprise, conceived by a Chicago-based architect, Edward J. Noonan; his wife, Eve Noonan, a marketing specialist; their oldest son, David, a lawyer and developer in New York; and his wife, Susan, who founded and oversees an 80-person public relations firm. 
The Noonans oversee and gain revenue from virtually every aspect of ownership, architectural design, financing, land management and home construction. "We're trying to weld all aspects of development together," said Edward Noonan, a third-generation Chicago architect whose father, T. Clifford Noonan, a member of the famed firm of Graham, Anderson, Probst & White, was the chief architect for the State Department building in Washington. "It seemed to me that developers were always treating architects like children, sending them from the room when they talked about money. My response has always been: Well if they can go to the bank, so can I."
So far, it's working. In 1990, the Noonans invested $510,000 and bought one of the last farms within Michigan City's borders, five miles from downtown, vowing to honor agricultural character and heritage. More than a decade later, there is still a farm at Tryon Farm, along with a barn that houses livestock, working farm fields, thick forests, restored wildflower meadows, acres of wetlands and permanently protected open spaces. This natural bounty -- most of which has existed since the farm was first cut from the Indiana woods 141 years ago by the Tryon family -- serves as a featured amenity, like the fairways in golf developments or waterfront in lakeside units.
""We call this a rehab job," said Eve Noonan, who is obviously lavishing the same reservoirs of energy to this family project that she once devoted to raising her five children. "It was a dairy farm that for a century was a terrific place to live. It's still a farm. The original farmstead is here. The original barns and outbuildings are here. What we've tried to do is fit the homes into the landscape without intruding."
The design of Tryon Farm's master plan mimics the Middle West landscape of the 19th century, when prairie farmsteads were surrounded by numerous outbuildings. In the Noonans' design, groups of 8 to 20 homes are clustered close together in eight "settlements," each separated from the others by expanses of field, woods or meadows. More than 120 of the farm's 170 acres are permanently off limits to construction. 
Buyers own their own homes and a small skirt of land around the building, but the rest of the land is shared in common ownership for which residents pay a monthly fee of roughly $90 to a homeowners' association. Trails wind under the forest canopy and through the meadows, and on warm days the place feels much more like summer camp than a housing development. 
One of Tryon Farm's settlements, near the original farmstead, is completed, and a second in thick hardwoods is under way. Prices range from $100,000 for free-standing 650-square-foot lodges to $400,000 for 2,400-square-foot four-bedroom homes. So far 25 homes have sold, including eight this year. 
The project, which was approved under the planned unit development provision of Michigan City's zoning code, is allowed 150 homes on the property. The Noonans, who have invested $1.5 million to date, think that it will take 10 more years to complete Tryon Farm and that when it is fully built out, it will be valued at $40 million.
One resident is Paula Hardin, a teacher and author from Chicago, a 65-minute drive or 80-minute train ride away, from a station that is a five-minute drive from Tryon Farm. Ms. Hardin bought her cozy home two years ago. From the outside, her home and the others in the Farmstead Settlement look like traditional Midwest farmhouses. 
The interiors, though, are airy, light-filled and often distinguished by dramatic two-story living rooms, with lofts and balconies. Some have flying bridges that serve as second floor walkways linking bedrooms on one side of the home to the other. Ms. Hardin quickly learned that her guests naturally gravitated at night to her home's outdoor deck. "They'd bring out their sleeping bags and lie there for hours watching the stars," Ms. Hardin said. "We don't have street lights here, so we can really see the stars."
At Tryon Farm, homeowners can also see goats, herds of deer in the meadows, alfalfa in working fields and rare green herons prancing stoically in restored wetlands. 
"It's not that we have some ideology or philosophy," she said. "People who live here like the simplicity of nature. There are professors here, artists, professional people, families who don't have to have a swimming pool or a golf course."
Such conservation-minded developments, which in the Midwest include Prairie Crossing in Grayslake, Ill., and Fields of St. Croix in Lake Elmo, Minn., gather homes, streets and parks in much closer proximity while leaving a substantial portion of the land undeveloped and often wild. Buyers say they are also attracted by the opportunity to establish more traditional neighborhood relationships than they can develop in conventional and sprawling large-lot subdivisions. Tryon Farm, though, goes several steps further than other alternative housing developments in encouraging both fealty to nature and community.
The development's design was produced by Chicago Associates Planners and Architects, Mr. Noonan's eight-member architecture firm. Mr. Noonan, who credits his partner Thomas Forman with conceiving the site's land plan and another partner, Michael Newman, for overseeing architectural details, describes the design goal as "understanding the whole relationship between privacy and community."
He added: "Modern subdivisions aim everything at the big spaces inside -- fancy kitchens, bigger bathrooms -- and the private backyard. The sequence of arriving at a modern subdivision home is to drive into the garage and walk directly into the house. There is very little chance of connecting with your neighbor. 
"What we're trying to do here is to educate ourselves and others to understand what you really need to live well in a country setting."
Even though homes are close together, Mr. Noonan ensured privacy by designing the windows of Tryon Farm's homes to overlook the open fields and not the neighbors. Most houses have terraces and gardens enclosed by fences. 
But to encourage neighbors to get to know each other, Tryon Farm established a community garden, and cars are parked in a common area near a row of mailboxes. That means neighbors coming and going will have the chance to run into each other. 
There are also features of the development that the most ardent environmentalist would admire. One of the most ambitious is that waste water from homes is treated not in septic systems or carried away in a city sewer but cleansed in a series of constructed wetlands that also serve as habitat for wading birds that flock to the farm. 
The well-understood technology, which deploys plants to absorb nutrients, has been used successfully to treat waste water in Arcata, Calif., and many other communities. There is no smell at all, and water emerges thoroughly cleaned of contaminants and is used to irrigate the alfalfa. By developing the natural system, the Noonans also avoided thousands of dollars annually in the cost of financing an expensive city sewer connection.

HEADLINE: The Slide Begins 

BYLINE:  By VIVIAN S. TOY 

 BODY:
MORE than 10 weeks after terrorists leveled the World Trade Center, statisticians have begun to measure the shock waves from the attack as they reverberate through Long Island's economy.
 There were big jolts like the $27.1 million drop in sales tax revenues collected in Nassau County for September and October compared with last year's receipts for the same time, and the $45 million loss in hotel receipts across the Island for the two months. There were smaller bumps too, like a real estate market that came to a virtual standstill immediately after Sept. 11 before rebounding, and an unemployment rate that grew from 2.9 percent in October 2000 to 3.5 percent last month. 
 The news was not all bad, though. The Long Island jobless rate was still well below the nation's 5 percent rate and New York City's 6.2 percent. And some sectors shone. Many hotels on the East End stayed busier than usual, thanks to a warm fall but also to more people deciding to put off air travel and opting to stay closer to home. Many restaurants also reported booming business as Long Islanders filled neighborhood haunts rather than heading into the city for a show and dinner. And as the nation continued its war on terrorism, companies in the Island's vestigial defense industry sought to fill dozens of new jobs and anticipated more openings to come. 
Like the national and regional economies, Long Island had started to see signs of a downturn even before Sept. 11, and the decline seemed to accelerate in the immediate aftermath of the attacks. But while the city lost some 79,000 jobs after Sept. 11, the Island actually saw an increase of 10,900 jobs between October 2000 and last month.
Though the pace of job creation declined by a third from pre-Sept. 11 levels, economists and business leaders expressed a cautious optimism, saying the Island had been buffered from the more severe downturn experienced by New York City and the rest of the nation. They said they believed Long Island's economy would recover significantly by year's end.
"Long Islanders were clearly frozen in their tracks in the days immediately after Sept. 11," said Irwin Kellner, an economics professor at Hofstra University and the chief economist for North Fork Bank and CBS MarketWatch. "But there are a lot of signs that things returned to normal in October."
Pearl M. Kamer, chief economist for the Long Island Association, said Long Island's economy "is slowing, but not dramatically so." She said that while the sales tax revenues reflect a big blow to consumer confidence after the World Trade Center attack, "the fact that the labor market has held up as well as it has is a good sign."
Housing values on Long Island have also held up, she said, "and that creates a wealth effect that means people will be inclined to spend, and once the shock of the attack has worn off, consumer spending will rebound to normal levels."
The sales tax revenues for September and October, as provided by the state Department of Taxation and Finance, were the biggest indicators of an economic slowdown on the Island. In Nassau County, sales tax receipts plunged 16.9 percent in September compared to September 2000 and dropped 8.8 percent in October. In Suffolk County, the sales tax revenues edged down less than one percent in September, but then fell 10.1 percent in October.
The drop in sales tax receipts could translate into additional budget cuts or tax increases in both counties, where sales taxes are a major revenue source. The 2002 spending plan that Suffolk legislators approved earlier this month included a 13 percent county property tax increase, prompted in part by an estimated loss of as much as $57 million in sales tax revenues from Sept. 11 through the end of next year. In order to close a potential budget gap of $38 million, the Suffolk legislators also approved a controversial 1.5 percent increase on the sales tax for home heating fuels, a move that will generate about $14 million in additional revenues next year.
Suffolk's approved budget also included $10 million in fee increases that still face public hearings and must be formally approved by the Legislature before January. The increases include a rise in bus fare from $1.50 to $1.75, an increase in vehicle registration fees from $4 to $5, and increases for park services such as beach parking and camping, greens fees and marina dock fees.
Nassau County legislators face an even more onerous task, as they must meet a Nov. 28 deadline to erase up to $45 million in gaps that state monitors found in the budget originally proposed by the retiring county executive, Thomas S. Gulotta, and revised by the county Legislature. Members of the Nassau Interim Finance Authority, the state-appointed board that stands poised to take over the county's finances if the legislators fail to come up with a balanced budget, have voiced concerns that recent losses in sales tax revenues could significantly worsen the county's financial outlook.
The budget currently calls for a 5 percent property tax increase. Thomas R. Suozzi, the county executive-elect, has floated the notion of an additional 10 percent tax increase, and members of the Democratic majority in the Legislature have pushed for a combination of spending cuts and additional revenue increases. But the Republican minority opposes any more tax increases.
But even though the sales tax figures for September and October signal a slowing economy, Dr. Kamer said the relatively strong sales tax revenues for the earlier part of the year would help soften the blow. She predicted that the Island would see an overall sales tax revenue increase of about 2 percent for the entire year -- a figure that is much lower than the 6.2 percent growth experienced in 2000 and the 6.7 percent growth in 1999, but growth nonetheless.
"I think we'll see a gradual recovery in consumer spending, but people will probably be more careful and postpone big-ticket items." she said. "The go-go days of the last several years won't be returning anytime soon."
Rebecca Demicell, a Garden City resident, personified that caution last week as she shopped at the Nordstrom's at Roosevelt Field. Like many other Long Islanders, she stayed away from the malls for weeks after the tragedy. "You just re-evaluate your priorities after something like that," she said, adding that she would probably spend much more conservatively this holiday season because of the uncertainty of the times. "It's also just really hard to get back in the Christmas spirit," she said.
Michael Hollander, president of the Long Island Convention and Visitors Bureau and Sports Commission, said that with hundreds of businesses canceling meetings and conventions scheduled to be held on Long Island, the Island's hotel industry lost $30 million in anticipated revenue in September and another $15 million in October.
"We expect the rest of the year is going to be slow as well," he said. "We're still dealing with the fact that even though we didn't have the attack here, a lot of the people that got hurt are from here. As they continue to recover bodies, Long Island will still be holding funerals and memorials. So it's hard to stop thinking about it and to move on."
The Hampton Inn in Commack, for example, fielded scores of calls from people canceling their hotel reservations in the first few weeks after the attack. "Every time the phone rang, it was another cancellation," said Bill Mullaney, the general manager. Most were from business travelers who instead were opting for conference calls, but there also were wedding guests who canceled because they just didn't want to fly.
Angelo Auricchio, president of the Long Island Restaurant Association, said catering halls across the Island lost 10 to 12 percent of their business as the number of out-of-town wedding guests diminished. "We usually hold people to a minimum guaranteed number of guests, but you can't do that under these circumstances," he said. "Everybody's got to take it on the chin a little bit."
Restaurants, on the other hand, have seen an increase in business after an initial lull right after Sept. 11. At Waterzooi in Garden City and its sister restaurant, the Victory Oyster Bar and Smokehouse, for example, Saturday night waits have increased from an average 45 minutes to an hour and a half. "I guess it's that people have to move on with their lives," said Ed Davis, one of the co-owners. "But they're still hard pressed to make it into the city."
Tom Neeley, chairman of the Hamptons Visitors Council, said interest in the Hampton Jitney's day trips into the city for Broadway shows and museums has plunged. "People just aren't taking the casual trips to New York City they might have taken," he said.
At the same time, East End hotels have filled many more rooms long beyond the usual summer season and local attractions have enjoyed record turnouts as people have headed east to get away from the city. The Southampton Inn has even booked some business conferences, as well as rooms for crews doing fashion photo shoots that had originally been planned for more distant locales like Hawaii and California.
Employment figures for Nassau and Suffolk Counties show another area where the Island has fared better than the city. Although the seasonally adjusted unemployment rate grew to 3.5 percent, the total number of jobs from October 2000 to October 2001 still grew by 10,900. The previous month's job growth was stronger, registering 16,300 more jobs from September to September using a survey taken before Sept. 11.
Gary E. Huth, a labor market analyst with the state Department of Labor, said much of the decline could be attributed to commuters who lost jobs in lower Manhattan, but also to cutbacks at LaGuardia and Kennedy Airports, which employ many Nassau County residents. "We certainly have been affected by Sept. 11," he said. "But we've done better than the rest of the country."
Mr. Huth said Long Island held relatively steady because other parts of the nation suffered heavy losses in manufacturing jobs, the kinds of jobs Long Island lost in the earlier downturn of the 1980's and early 1990's. "The diversification of the economy after that protected Long Island a little this time around," he said. "A lot of the companies that made it through that painful period also became much more competitive, leaner and meaner than before."
LIA Staffing, a subsidiary of the Long Island Association, the island's largest business organization, has scheduled workshops in response to the rising unemployment rate. "Things have changed so significantly in the last six months, people need a little help figuring out where to go," said Scott Passeser, president of LIA Staffing. The defense industry, for example, is going strong right now. "Long Island may not make the fighter planes anymore, but it's still supplying the communications systems and making new electronics for them," he said.
Telephonics Corp., in Huntington, makes radio and radar equipment for some military airplanes and has about 50 job openings, mainly for engineers. Northrop Grumman Integrated Systems in Bethpage, which produces computer systems for military planes, expects to hire up to 500 more people over the next three to five years. 
A renewed emphasis on the defense industry, along with other areas where Long Island has shown growth in recent years, such as the biomedical and health care industries, are all good signs for the Island, said Dr. Kellner, the Hofstra economics professor.
"The truth is we were slowing down long before Sept. 11, just like the rest of the country," he said. "But building on these industries where we're strong is going to lead us out of the recession and we'll start to see signs of recovery by early next year."

HEADLINE: FILM; 
The City Of Our Dreams

BYLINE:  By NANCY RAMSEY; Nancy Ramsey's most recent article for Arts & Leisure was about Eisenstein's "Que Viva Mexico" on DVD.

 BODY:
ON a clear, crisp November morning, Betty Comden and Adolph Green are seated side by side in Ms. Comden's sunny apartment near Lincoln Center, high above the Hudson River. Finishing each other's sentences, adding a gentle correction here, a quick clarification there, the two 80-something writers, who have been collaborating for more than 60 years and still meet daily, moved easily through fond remembrances of their days working with Leonard Bernstein, Rosalind Russell, Judy Holliday, Gene Kelly.
 Three of the films Ms. Comden and Mr. Green wrote -- "On the Town" (1949), "The Band Wagon" (1953) and "Auntie Mame" (1958) -- will be featured in "A Wonderful Town: New York in Film," a series beginning on Saturday at the Museum of Modern Art. The series is made up of 13 films produced over 70 years, from Buster Keaton's "The Cameraman" (1928) to Jim Fall's "Trick" (1999), and includes "42nd Street" (1933), "It Should Happen to You" (1954) and "Manhattan" (1979). 
 A conversation with Ms. Comden and Mr. Green about "On the Town," which was a Broadway musical before it was a film, naturally led to talk of the team's days and nights as part of the Revuers, a five-person cabaret and comedy act at Max Gordon's Village Vanguard in the late 1930's. 
"I was surprised at how it took off," said Mr. Green, who still merits the description dapper.
"But you remember, Adolph," said Ms. Comden, petite and elegant. "We didn't play well out of town."
Well of course not. Theirs was a witty and wry commentary on the events of the day; they assumed in their audiences a certain urbanity, a knowledge of literature and the arts, and a willingness to join them in sending up characters who needed sending up.
The story of Comden and Green is a quintessential New York tale fit for the movies -- she came from Brooklyn and he from the Bronx, and with talent, perseverance and luck, they saw their work move to Broadway and the movies. Laurence Kardish, senior curator in the department of film and media at the Museum of Modern Art, said that Comden and Green "helped define New York for the rest of the country with their lyrics and imagery, their perennial youthfulness, their intelligence, their humor."
The "Wonderful Town" series was conceived in response to the events of Sept. 11, and there will be no "Sweet Smell of Success," no "Mean Streets," no "Taxi Driver." (The darkest film in the series is "All About Eve," which, Mr. Kardish said, he couldn't resist including because "the wit is so New York.") Instead, the films present the New York of E. B. White, who in his 1948 essay "Here Is New York" wrote of three cities: those of the commuter, the native and the settler. The greatest was the last, he wrote, "the city of final destination, the city that is a goal. . . . Commuters give the city its tidal restlessness; natives give it solidity and continuity; but the settlers give it passion."
It is the city of "42nd Street," where Ruby Keeler is plucked from obscurity to fill the tap shoes of a leading lady -- "You're going out a youngster, but you've got to come back a star"; of "On the Town," where three sailors pack a year's worth of romance and adventure into 24 hours; and of "The Cameraman," where Buster Keaton lives out a fantasy of playing ball at Yankee Stadium -- hitting, pitching and scoring a run, all solo. It is a place of serendipity and possibility, where a kindly elderly gentleman who takes a seasonal job at Macy's does turn out to be Santa Claus (the 1947 "Miracle on 34th Street"); where the working girl played by Jean Arthur rides an open-air double-decker bus one morning along Fifth Avenue and a fur coat falls on top of her ("Easy Living," 1937); where Judy Holliday sees her name above Columbus Circle and finds true love with an earnest young Jack Lemmon ("It Should Happen to You"). In a town of consummate elegance, Rosalind Russell ("Auntie Mame") descends a grand circular staircase and dazzles her young nephew with her banter and eccentricities, and one evening in Central Park, Fred Astaire and Cyd Charisse step out of a hansom cab and into one of the most graceful dances ever performed on film ("The Band Wagon").
When filmmaking left the back lots and sound stages of Hollywood for the actual streets of New York, the effect was just as magical. Mention early independent filmmaking in New York and the name Morris Engel immediately comes up; Francois Truffaut, in fact, said that France's New Wave "would never have come into being if it hadn't been for the young American Morris Engel, who showed us the way to independent production with his fine movie 'Little Fugitive.' " While "Little Fugitive" is not included in the series -- there is more tension and anxiety than the curators thought appropriate for "A Wonderful Town" -- his "Lovers and Lollipops" (1955) is. (Mr. Engel collaborated on both films with his late wife, the photographer Ruth Orkin.) "We wanted to do 'Lovers and Lollipops' as simply and economically as possible," Mr. Engel recalled recently, in his Central Park West apartment. "I didn't believe in tripods or lights, and I had limited experience dealing with actors." The story is spare, the dialogue minimal -- a little girl resists her widowed mother's new romance -- and New York, in intimate mini-portraits of Central Park, Chinatown and the Bronx Zoo, is a central character.
For the director Ang Lee, "New York is a city of endless angles. You could make 100 movies in New York and still find 100 more angles," he said by telephone from Los Angeles. In "Pushing Hands" (1992), also included in the series, a retired tai chi master from Beijing comes to live with his son and daughter-in-law in a suburb north of Manhattan and rediscovers his identity not in his family circle but in New York's Chinatown. At New York University in the early 1980's, Mr. Lee recalled, he made student films by first scouting locations, deciding which places he wanted to film, and then writing a narrative. Now working on an adaptation of "The Incredible Hulk" in Hollywood, he said he still feels "like a New York filmmaker, independent in spirit and youthful cooperation," and he plans to return to New York for post-production. "Mixing, sound, editing -- it's all along the No. 1 train." 
Location, location, location, and who needs color? In the late 1970's, New York was emerging from a fiscal crisis, but Woody Allen's neurotic writer, Isaac, in "Manhattan" opened his narration with a love letter to the city, "still a town that existed in black-and-white and pulsated to the great tunes of George Gershwin." In the film, Isaac writes: "He adored New York City. He romanticized it all out of proportion. . . . He thrived on the hustle and bustle of the crowds and the traffic. To him, New York meant beautiful women and street-smart guys who seemed to know all the angles. . . . New York was his town. And it always would be."
Just as New York will always be a town of aspiring Broadway composers and stars, of small towns within the larger metropolis, of intimate clubs in one neighborhood, then another, then still another. Mr. Fall's "Trick" is an updated, boy-meets-boy romantic comedy set in the West Village: an aspiring songwriter and a go-go dancer spend a night trying to find a place to sleep together.
"Even though I was way beyond romanticizing the city when I made my movie, it was still a magical place for me," Mr. Fall said by telephone from Los Angeles, where he now lives and works. "I very much wanted to make a movie that represented how I felt about the city and that specific niche, the piano-bar cabaret scene in the 1990's."
It's a scene that doesn't exist in the same way in Los Angeles, and for Mr. Fall it's difficult to pinpoint just how the cabaret scene there comes up short. More integrity in the New York performances, he wondered? More real wit?
Hard to say, but then, Comden and Green's revue didn't play well in Los Angeles, Chicago, Cincinnati, Pittsburgh. "You need the right spot, the right audience," said Mr. Green.
"At nightclubs people are talking, drinking, playing footsy," Ms. Comden said. "Or maybe it was the material, Adolph. It was rather sophisticated." 
"Oh, Betty," said Mr. Green, "you know it was sophisticated."

HEADLINE: Going From Surplus to Deficit in One Year 

BYLINE:  By STACEY STOWE

 BODY:
LAST June, the state had a surplus of $644.8 million, left over from fiscal year 2001. The General Assembly held a special session to decide what to do with the money as they approved the 2002 budget.
 Yet in a sobering turn of events, legislators earlier this month were back in special session, buried in bitter partisan debate over how to fill a projected $300 million hole in the state's general fund $12 billion budget this year. 
 After three days of debate between legislative leaders and Gov. John G. Rowland, a compromise was reached on Nov. 16 when the General Assembly sent a bill to the governor that would reduce $200 million of the deficit. The remainder is to be addressed in February when the General Assembly convenes. 
Yet Mr. Rowland, who can reduce up to 5 percent of the budget without legislative approval, warned that he might need to make additional cuts if forthcoming economic data reveal a worsening deficit.
How did it happen? Blame it on the poor economy, state budget analysts said. Connecticut, like most of the country, has been hit hard by an economic downturn that began as early as last March and gathered steam following Sept. 11.
For each month since June, revenue from sales, income and business taxes has dropped off or not met projections, resulting in a projected $300 million deficit. In addition, the $644.8 million surplus legislators toyed with in June, turned out to be $612.9 million in September when the budget books were closed out.
"There were indications as early as March that revenue was not as robust," said Thomas Fiore, revenue chief for the State Office of Policy and Management. "Sept. 11 exacerbated trends already under way. There was slower revenue growth, but it was nothing like we experienced in the early 1990's."
Between May and September, residents lost 15,900 jobs, contributing to a slowdown in revenue from withholding tax.. An anticipated revenue growth of 6 percent from withholding tax was instead 1.1 percent between March and September. Sales tax revenue from June to September is down 2 percent from the same period last year. 
Gloomy though it seems, Connecticut doesn't have it as bad as other states. New Jersey, for example, is facing a deficit of almost $2 billion. In Connecticut, the projected deficit represents about 2.5 percent of the overall budget. In the recession of fiscal 1991 referred to by Mr. Fiore, the state faced a 14 percent deficit, or was $965 million in the red. By that time, the state had spent the entire budget reserve fund, also known as the Rainy Day Fund. By law, the state must maintain a budget reserve fund equal to 5 percent of its general fund appropriations each year. The governor has made it clear that the $594.7 million Rainy Day Fund was off limits for the current crisis. Instead, he pressed for cuts.
"It's drizzling, it's not pouring," Mr. Rowland said at a news conference in October where he nonetheless made the case for a special session of the legislature. Democratic leaders resisted the idea.
Democrat Kevin B. Sullivan, president pro tempore of the State Senate, proclaimed a special session "would be a disaster" and urged the governor to leave the topic of revenue shortfall for February, the regular session of the legislature. Yet there was no denying the numbers. The Democrats conceded that when State Comptroller Nancy Wyman, a Democrat, sent a letter to the governor saying she too believed the deficit should be addressed sooner rather than later.
The governor urged the legislative leadership of both parties to create a deficit reduction package in preparation for the special session on Nov. 13. He had already cut about $30 million under his authority. When the leadership hadn't reached a compromise by Nov. 12, Mr. Rowland threatened to lay off state employees if an acceptable plan were not reached by Nov. 16, the end of the special session. Some Democratic legislators criticized him for the remark.
"We don't think it's a great idea in a time of economic crisis to tell people they're going to lose their jobs," Mr. Sullivan said.
The finger pointing was just beginning. Over the course of four days, the budget battle was waged strictly along party lines. The Republicans lobbied for steep cuts across the board following the governor's lead to put "everything on the table."
"The pain should be shared," said Robert M. Ward, Republican Senate minority leader.
Meanwhile, the Democrats hatched their own plan, one that Mr. Sullivan said, "pinches more than pains." It called for the long-term borrowing of about $107 million for various projects, including $50 million to make interest payments on local school projects, projects that would have been paid for in cash out of the surplus prior to the deficit. The plan also proposed about $133 million in cuts, skimming from programs and finding savings in energy accounts where actual costs turned out to be less than projected.
The Republicans balked. Mr. Rowland called the budget a "scam full of gimmicks." The real savings amounted to about $84 million; other cuts were for one-time rather than on-going programs costs or to departments already operating at a deficit, said the governor's budget chief, Marc S. Ryan.
The Democrats, who control both houses of the General Assembly, nevertheless drafted a bill of the plan at midnight on Nov. 14 and vowed to pass it. Dean Pagani, the governor's spokesman, mentioned the word veto and countered that the governor had a veto-safe margin in the House.
"It's a fiscally prudent plan that found savings with the minimum of damage to programs," said Moira K. Lyons, speaker of the House. Mr. Ryan lambasted the Democrat's plan.
The next day, moments before a House vote, Mr. Rowland requested a meeting with his budget director, Republican leaders, Ms. Lyons and Mr. Sullivan. What emerged was a compromise that reduced long-term borrowing to $63.6 million and made deeper, across-the-board cuts totaling $136.5 million. The rest of the deficit would be addressed, legislators said, in February. The bill passed by 121-17 in the House and 24-11 in the Senate. Several Republicans couldn't bring themselves to sign it.
"Only in government can you leave a $100 million hole in your finances and call it a solution," said Senator Louis C. DeLuca, a Republican from Woodbury and Senate minority leader. "Where I come from, when you don't have enough money to cover your expenses, you reduce your spending; you don't turn around and put everything on a credit card."
The Democrats said programs were safe and what's more, Mr. Rowland guaranteed no layoffs.
The session fell short by $100 million in addressing the deficit, but Mr. Rowland said, "I'll take two-thirds of a loaf any day."

 BODY:
Jugglers as Idiots
 Gyro, Pyro and Walter, jugglers known as the Flaming Idiots, will give two performances today at 1 p.m. and 3 p.m. at Fairfield University's Quick Center for the Arts. 
 Rather than keeping plates, clubs and balls aloft as most jugglers do, they toss swords, fire and each other with abandon. Some of the gags will be appreciated by adults more than the children (from 4 to 10 years old) for whom the show is recommended. Tickets are $10, children $8. 
"The Mystery of King Tut," a colorfully mounted performance by Theatreworks/USA about Howard Carter, discoverer of the boy king's tomb, is scheduled tomorrow at 10 a.m., suitable for children in grades 2 through 7. Tickets are $5.
Reservations and directions: (203) 254-4010.

Bushnell Expansion
The Bushnell in Hartford, one of New England's largest and best known performing arts centers, has completed a $45 million expansion, which opens tomorrow.
Adjacent to the existing 2,800-seat William H. Mortensen Theater, a new 90,000-square-foot addition has been built, containing the 907-seat Maxwell and Ruth Belding Theater, a cafe, a gift shop, classrooms, restrooms, private dining and public reception space.
An open house is scheduled on Saturday from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. when the public may take free guided tours of the building and attend performances by more than 60 arts groups.
Celebratory events scheduled throughout the week begin tomorrow with an exhibition of archival photographs and posters tracing the history of the building and its extraordinary contribution to Connecticut's cultural life.
Since 1930, the Bushnell has housed a myriad of programs from lectures to P.T.A. meetings, from children's theater to political conventions and cooking classes. But its role in playing host to world-class concerts, theater, grand opera, dance and comedy has been its forte.
On Thursday at 8 p.m., the Connecticut Forum will present "The Power of Music," a panel discussion with Beverly Sills, coloratura soprano of the Metropolitan and New York City Opera Companies and current chairman of Lincoln Center; Bob Weir, co-founder of the Grateful Dead; Nicholas Payton, the award-winning trumpeter, and Trey Anastasio, the lead vocalist, guitarist and composer for Phish. Call (860) 509-0909 for tickets priced from $25 to $50.

HEADLINE: Commercial Property/New Jersey; 
Waterfront Projects Planned North of Jersey City

BYLINE:  By JOHN HOLUSHA 

 BODY:
TIMES may be uncertain, but Steven J. Pozycki says he is sure. His company, SJP Properties, is going to build a 550,000-square-foot office building on the Hoboken waterfront on speculation that the property and location will attract corporate clients.
 He has reason for his optimism. The new building will be the twin to one nearing completion at the site that leased up rapidly, luring the venerable publisher John Wiley & Sons from Manhattan. 
 Meanwhile, Emanuel Stern, president of Hartz Mountain Industries, is moving forward with plans to build five office buildings of various sizes, a parking deck and a hotel at its Lincoln Harbor development on the waterfront in Weehawken by the entrance to the Lincoln Tunnel. While Mr. Stern is not ready to put a shovel in the ground without an anchor tenant for each building, all he needs is to lease 40,000 square feet of space to get the smallest of his office projects under way. 
Although Jersey City remains the largest location for office buildings on the west bank of the Hudson River, the 14-story buildings in Hoboken and the plans in Weehawken, where Hartz already has 1.8 million square feet of office, retail and residential space, indicate that locations to the north are attracting attention as well.
TRANSPORTATION problems between Jersey City and Lower Manhattan as a result of the attack on the World Trade Center may help to make projects farther up the coast more attractive, observed Donald Eisen, executive managing director of Cushman & Wakefield of New Jersey, a part of the brokerage and services company. The attack closed the direct connection between Jersey City and the Trade Center via the PATH tubes, forcing commuters to take ferries or roundabout routes on the remaining PATH route and city subways.
"Those projects may benefit from the closing of the last PATH station in Jersey City," Mr. Eisen said.
But he added that the great rush to find space since Sept. 11 has passed and that companies are thinking further into the future before making commitments to occupy space. "We are in a more thoughtful time," he said. "If people can delay making a decision, they will delay."
Given the location of Waterfront Corporate Park -- a short walk from the Hoboken rail, PATH and bus terminal -- Mr. Pozycki likes to talk about transportation. Rail lines from across northern New Jersey converge at the Hoboken terminal, with the remaining PATH lines providing access to Midtown Manhattan and a ferry available for trips to downtown. 
The project also sits near the Hudson-Bergen light rail line, which is scheduled to reach Hoboken from Jersey City next summer, adding north-south transportation of the existing east-west infrastructure. SJP Properties executives say they expect New York Waterway, the operator of existing ferries across the Hudson River, including one to Lincoln Harbor, to add to its service from Hoboken to Midtown once the new office buildings are occupied in the winter of 2002. Construction of the second building is already under way.
Mr. Pozycki argues that transportation on the surface of the Hudson is a better answer to the region's commuting problems than trying to find billions of dollars to build an underwater tunnel. "Water transportation can be added to quickly in response to need," he said. "You add bigger boats or faster boats as the demand grows."
The renewed emphasis on ferry service is also an indication of how New Jersey has reconnected with the river along a stretch where decaying docks formerly separated people from the water. In the compact city of Hoboken, the waterfront revival has transformed a drab industrial ruin to an attractive residential area, replete with restored houses, shops and restaurants.
Decades ago, River Street on the waterfront was lined with bars where dockworkers and others met, drank and fought. "This place was the Barbary Coast in the 1950's," Mr. Pozycki said.
Now, the two office buildings will be at 111 and 121 River Street and will be connected to the river by a tree-lined pedestrian walkway. Jutting far out into the river is a pier that has been rebuilt by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey as an urban park. Another pier to the north is being dismantled and will be replaced by a second park. "The city is rediscovering its waterfront as a result of the quality of the investments by the Port Authority," Mr. Pozycki said.
The two piers and the waterfront walkway total 15 acres of parkland in front of the building and, not incidentally, assure tenants excellent views of Midtown Manhattan. The attractiveness of the site and the transportation links are reasons Mr. Pozycki and his partner on the project, the Newark-based Prudential Insurance, are willing to build on speculation, at a time when the economy is clearly slowing. "There is no place else in the region where I and my partners at Prudential would be willing to spec a 500,000-square-foot office building," Mr. Pozycki said.
As Mr. Stern of Hartz Mountain likes to point out, it was his company that started redeveloping the New Jersey waterfront when it began Lincoln Harbor in 1982. He said he is prepared to move forward on the final phase of the project as soon as he signs some tenants. 
Those plans call for two connected office towers totaling 855,000 square feet, a separate 200,000-square-foot building and another that will have 90,000 square feet of space. Also part of package are a 135-room all-suites hotel that is positioned so that it will not interfere with the view of Manhattan that is available to motorists on the highway that twists down from the high bluffs of Weehawken to the Lincoln Tunnel.
Mr. Stern said two of the proposed buildings -- one of 450,000 square feet and another of 405,000 -- have been granted final approvals and could be ready for occupancy in a year. "Lincoln Harbor's new phase can be delivered within 12 months of lease signing because the buildings have been designed, engineered and approved, whereas a project of this nature would normally take up to two years to complete," he said.
"Lincoln Harbor is a seven-minute trip from Midtown Manhattan by ferry and it is a refreshing trip," said Michael T. Cohen, president of the Williams Real Estate Company, which has been hired to market the project. He said he expected the riverside buildings to be a lower cost alternative to Manhattan tenants who have been squeezed by rising rents in recent years.
He said tenants faced with rates between $50 and $70 a square foot in Midtown could expect to save 10 to 15 percent by crossing the river.
Midtown was the relevant market to look at because of its proximity to Weehawken, he said. "Our site is for overflow from Midtown, just as Jersey City was for the overflow from the financial district downtown."
BECAUSE many of the tenants displaced from downtown have resettled -- often as subtenants -- in Midtown, the New Jersey office building may not find tenants until normal growth resumes, Mr. Eisen said.
"A lot of people from downtown went to Midtown, which buoyed the Midtown market but does not leave much room for growth," he said. "If growth resumes, it favors the waterfront."
Mr. Stern describes Lincoln Harbor, which has office space, residential buildings, an existing hotel, restaurants and other retail space, as a "mixed use, low rise, urban campus." He said the ferry link between the development and Midtown Manhattan had grown in importance since Sept. 11, given restrictions on tunnel traffic. 
"The ferry works," he said. "They have become a permanent part of life since Sept. 11."
And, although no one wants to appear to be profiting from the attack and its aftermath, said Mr. Stern, whose company has investments in New York City as well as in New York, it was almost inevitable that many workers who had been downtown will not want to return because of frightening memories and fears of further attacks.
"Many of the people who worked there on Sept. 11 do not want to go back," he said. "That is a problem and an opportunity for the city of New York."

HEADLINE: The Smart Set Wastes Brainpower on Socializing 

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Viewed from my 25 years as a Mensa member, "Hanging Out With the Smart Set" (Nov. 18) is an apropos title for the New Jersey chapter, or indeed of the national organization. "Hanging out" indicates that our predominant interest is in social gatherings. 
"Smart" applies to our cleverness in games and puzzles. 
 What has been disappointing to me and a very small minority of members is what seems to be a lack ofwhat we had expected to be a forum for intelligent and constructive debates about the tough problems facing the nation and the world.
The Times article ends with a Mensan saying "we have our priorities straight. We're searching for happiness." Fine, but just as as individuals and as a nation, we feel impelled to divert a small portion of our wealth to the welfare of the less fortunate, should not Mensans divert some small portion of their brainpower to working on solutions to the many serious problems facing the nation and the world in this century? Is there a way to avert the predictable ill effects of global warming without damaging our economy as our politicians fear? Are there measures in addition to our military actions that we should be taking to address the root causes of the terrorism that is a hazard to our well-being? With a finite planet can we continue with an never ending growth of population and utilization of natural resources? It is regretful that Mensan brain power is dormant on such matters.

HEADLINE: NEIGHBORHOOD REPORT: WILLIAMSBURG; 
A Shelter Plan Wins in Court, But Residents Aren't Swayed

BYLINE:  By ERIKA KINETZ 

 BODY:
Pigeons roost in rows along the yellow brick building at 89-111 Porter Avenue in eastern Williamsburg, Brooklyn. Sea gulls murmur. But this is a deceptive calm.
 Last fall, the Doe Fund won a 22-year, $176 million city contract to transform the building, an abandoned knitting factory, into a 400-bed shelter for homeless men. The plans have been tangled in legal and political turmoil since. But now, the Doe Fund, a nonprofit organization for helping the homeless, is finally free to start building. 
 On Nov. 14, State Supreme Court in Brooklyn dismissed a case brought by a coalition of residents, politicians and businesses to block the development on the ground that the impact on the neighborhood had not been adequately assessed.
George T. McDonald, founder and president of the fund, said he expected to start construction in two months and to open the shelter in early 2003.
But Martin S. Needelman, a lawyer representing the coalition, said his clients were considering an appeal. Residents say their neighborhood has little to offer the homeless. "There's no place for them to come out and have a snack," said Douglas McKinnon, who has lived in the area since 1990.
The site is surrounded by large, low buildings that belong to candy makers, bakeries, tortilla factories and import-export companies. The nearest shopping strip is about a mile away. "Can you imagine 400 men down on their luck coming to an area like this and thinking life would get any better?" said Donna Hoffman, an owner of a soft drink bottler that has been in the neighborhood since 1946. 
Mr. McDonald, however, said the shelter would not depend on local amenities. "We have everything that everybody needs inside of the facility," he said.
Residents of this largely low-income, Latino area also worry about protecting what to them is a fragile peace. "We have enough problems keeping the prostitutes from around here," said Mr. McKinnon, who has three sons.
Local business owners said the shelter would hinder the economic progress of the area, which the state designated as an economic development zone in 1998. They are mainly concerned about a lack of parking spaces and increased foot traffic that could disrupt the careful choreography of trucks and forklifts that currently dominates the sidewalks.
Since the court spurned their claims, both Ms. Hoffman and Sanford Wiener, an owner of a candy maker that employs 75 people, said they were considering leaving.
"We hear their concerns," Mr. McDonald said. "We are very willing to work with them."
He maintained that the shelter would be a boon to the neighborhood. 
"We'll help clean it up," he said. "There are prostitution and drugs there now. That won't be there when we get there."
It will also help the city. The shelter would replace roughly half the beds at the 30th Street Men's Shelter near Bellevue Hospital, which the city needs to relocate before New York University can use the land for its planned East River Science Park.

HEADLINE: NEIGHBORHOOD REPORT: EAST VILLAGE; 
A Raised Voice by a Noted Feminist, This Time Over Rental Politics

BYLINE:  By DENNY LEE 

 BODY:
Kate Millett, the feminist author and artist, is not a creature of the night by choice. She believes that city agents are stationed outside her door, ready to boot her from her outsized loft at 295 Bowery.
 "The city dogs are waiting for me," Ms. Millett said last week in her fifth-floor walk-up, between Houston and East First Streets, decorated very much like the bohemian womb one would expect. "But they don't work after-hours, so I only go out at night." 
 For three years, housing officials have been trying to evict Ms. Millett from her 2,400-square-foot home, where the city moved her some 30 years ago after condemning her rental across the street. Her rent, about $600 a month, covers both her loft and a third-floor art studio, which also has 2,400 square feet.
"This is about comparable space," Ms. Millett said between drags of cigarettes, her mood alternating between warm laughter and cold rage.
Once the darling of women's studies programs, Ms. Millett, whose books include "Sexual Politics" and "Mother Millett," eludes the spotlight these days. But at 67, she remains as strident as ever -- this time as the last holdout against the city's effort to raze her home in the name of urban renewal.
The two other artists who live in the building have accepted the city's offer to relocate to nearby lofts. Ms. Millett is fixing up her studio for coming gallery shows. "The day they wreck it, I'll be swinging on the wrecking ball," she said.
Plans to develop the largely vacant area have been on the drawing board for decades. With support from community activists, the city is on the verge of making final the Cooper Square Urban Renewal Project.
The project, approved this month by the City Planning Commission, calls for building about 700 market-rate and low-income apartments, ground-floor stores, and a community center with a pool and gymnasium. Final approval by the City Council is expected by the end of the year.
But before any demolition can begin, Ms. Millett must first be evicted. The city has offered her a 1,700-square-foot loft at 59 East Fourth Street, less than three-eighths the size of her current space. The rent would remain roughly the same.
"That's nothing to sneeze at, when you consider that there are many people moving into 400 square feet for $1,700," said Steve Herrick, executive director of the Cooper Square Committee, an advocacy group formed by residents in 1959.
But Ms. Millett said her books alone could probably fill a small East Village apartment. She has also amassed a large archive of artwork and personal papers, including an unpublished manuscript about 295 Bowery, a former brothel where a half-dozen demimondaines are said to have committed suicide more than a century ago. 
"It's really impossible to fit everything into that space," said Ms. Millett, who has hired a lawyer to fight the eviction. "We're going to hold out." DENNY LEE

HEADLINE: NEIGHBORHOOD REPORT: HARLEM; 
A Neighborhood Beacon Gets a Last-Minute Rescue

BYLINE:  By JUDITH MATLOFF 

 BODY:
For the people of West Harlem, the Hamilton Grange Library, at 145th Street and Amsterdam Avenue is not just a place to borrow books.
 For a neighborhood with many illegal drugs and few bookshops, the imposing 96-year-old limestone building is more like a safe haven. Parents know that their children will stay out of trouble there. Lonely elderly residents know that there they escape from unheated apartments. Students use the computers for research. It is an oasis for avid readers who cannot afford books. 
 On Dec. 14, the library will close its doors for much-needed renovations, which could last up to two years. Money for a temporary site had been in the city budget. But a month ago, residents learned that the money was eliminated because of budget cuts after the Sept. 11 attack. City officials said they could not even afford to put a trailer on an empty lot as an interim measure or provide a shuttle bus to take residents to another branch.
"Losing the library was of serious concern," said Daryl G. Bloodsaw, president of the 146th Street Block Association. "It would have been terrible for people here."
Led by Community Board 9, local leaders quickly swung into action to find an 11th-hour solution. They organized a search in which local residents went door-to-door, canvassing churches and landlords in pursuit of an affordable spot. Some residents even offered floors in their brownstones.
An unlikely solution finally came on Monday: an empty storefront on the ground floor of a co-op apartment building, 704 St. Nicholas Avenue, at 145th Street.
The space is a tiny 700 square feet, one-third what was originally sought. But as a favor to the community, the co-op that owns the building reduced the monthly rent to below the market rate. (The exact figure is still being negotiated.)
Members of Community Board 9 credit City Councilman Stanley Michels with saving the day by exerting considerable pressure on the city library administration to accept the deal. The city was reluctant to accept the plan because it did not want to spend additional money.
"We're ecstatic," said George W. Goodwill, chairman of Community Board 9. "The library provides a vital service due to the deep economic inequalities here. People don't want their children to fall through the cracks. The library gives them self-esteem and a safe place to do homework with some type of supervision."
The library is scheduled to move into its temporary space in January. The spot requires little work beyond the installation of shelves and lines for computers and telephones.
The renovation of the permanent structure, the first in 30 years, includes installing bathrooms for the disabled, building a new community room with performance space and improving computers and elevators.

HEADLINE: NEIGHBORHOOD REPORT: WILLIAMSBURG; 
A Brief Appearance by a SoHo Star Draws Mixed Reviews

BYLINE:  By HANNAH M. WALLACE 

 BODY:
When Joe Amrhein, a Conceptual painter, moved to Williamsburg 13 years ago, the neighborhood was teeming with artists but there were few galleries. A handful of alternative spaces like Brand Name Damages, Minor Injury and Test-Site, came and went. Other galleries like Pierogi, which Mr. Amrhein opened in 1994, stuck around. Today, Williamsburg has about 30 galleries, many of them artist-run. 
 But no one expected a major Manhattan gallery to set up shop. Then, on Sept. 7, the dealer Jeffrey Deitch, who has shown such high-profile artists as Vanessa Beecroft, Damian Loeb and Cecily Brown at his SoHo gallery, Deitch Projects, opened a 4,000-square-foot space on North 11th Street. 
 The opening work, a multimedia installation by the online collective Fakeshop, attracted a large crowd and created a buzz in the New York art world. But before Deitch Brooklyn could make much of an impression, it abruptly closed its doors three weeks after it opened. 
Mr. Deitch said he closed the gallery because of what he described as "problems with the leaseholder" and uncertainty after the Sept. 11 attack.
"I was planning an experimental program that I would've had to subsidize," he said. "After the 11th, I said, 'Let's try this again when we're more confident about the economic environment.' "
Jeff Gompertz, the founder of Fakeshop and the former tenant, said the original plan was for Deitch to rent most of the space. "We had a gentleman's agreement that Deitch would eventually take over the lease," said Mr. Gompertz. "It's still very open for him to do that." 
Deitch's brief star turn in Williamsburg highlights an important local divide. Some artists, proud of Williamsburg's reputation as an alternative art community, saw his arrival as the start of the neighborhood's "Chelseafication," a reference to the sleek galleries that have transformed western Chelsea. Others welcomed Deitch, knowing it would attract important collectors and dealers to smaller, lesser-known spaces.
"Williamsburg galleries serve as cultural centers where artists come to exchange ideas," said Gregory Volk, a critic for Art in America who has lived in Williamsburg since 1987. "The blue-chip Chelsea galleries -- and galleries like Deitch -- use a completely different model. They're focused on selling the art. If that model were to come here, it would be a disaster for Williamsburg."
Others expressed less concern about the arrival of Manhattan galleries. Christian Viveros-Faune, an owner of the Williamsburg gallery Roebling Hall, said he hoped Deitch returned to the neighborhood. 
"The more serious galleries around, the better," Mr. Viveros-Faune said. "The neighborhood is changing, but I'd much rather Jeffrey Deitch than Warsaw," he added, referring to a new local nightclub.
And some artists suggested that Deitch Brooklyn did, at least briefly, bring a new audience to the neighborhood. "It was much more the Chelsea crowd," said Eric Heist, a founder of Momenta Art, another Williamsburg gallery. "People we didn't recognize."

Their Demeanors Don't Betray The Desperation

BYLINE:  By FELICIA R. LEE

 BODY:
IN her worst weeks, Wai Chun Ng at least had a $50 paycheck. After 40 years of sewing in Chinatown factories, job cuts had reduced Ms. Ng to working as a finisher, earning a penny for every two buttons she cut the thread on. Last month, when Ms. Ng finally lost her job, she turned to the Red Cross to help put food on the table for herself and her retired husband.
 Ms. Ng, a small, soft-spoken 61-year-old woman, told her story as she sat in the Chinatown office of Local 23-25, the union of Needletrades, Industrial and Textile Employees. Her words were interpreted by Lana Cheung, the local's education director. 
 Ms. Cheung has spent the last two months trying to reassure her local's laid-off workers, trying to teach them about labor law and unemployment benefits. They are mostly Chinese women with children who speak no English, have no formal education and few marketable skills. Or, like Ms. Ng, they face age discrimination after years of low-wage jobs and lives confined to Chinatown.
But Ms. Ng said she was grateful that those years let her and her husband support four children in a government-subsidized Chinatown apartment. "I pay the rent," she said. "I buy the food. Not a luxury life."
Ms. Ng is among the 79,000 people whose jobs have disappeared from the city in the wake of Sept. 11, government officials say, a number higher than almost anyone anticipated.
Many New Yorkers have been noble since Sept. 11. But on Dec. 2, 32,800 families in the city will face the five-year federal welfare limit, even as thousands of twin tower victims scramble emotionally and financially, and yet untold numbers succumb to a faltering economy, creating the possible danger of competing victimhood. Still, possibly, the stories and the faces behind the losses can be a guide, practically and spiritually.
In Chinatown, to pick one place, the garment industry has been severely damaged since Sept. 11, because stores have canceled or postponed orders, workers are unable to endure the foul air, trucks are unable to get through. As many as 7,000 of the 12,000 Chinatown garment workers have lost their jobs, and most of the factories there are running at less than 50 percent capacity, the workers' union says. The average Chinatown garment worker is losing $943 in wages each month. Most of the city's garment workers are immigrants who earn less than $16,000 a year. 
Some qualify for disaster aid, some do not, Ms. Cheung said. Those who qualify must live in Manhattan and have worked in factories south of Canal Street, like Ms. Ng. "Asian people are very shy," said Ms. Cheung, a social worker by training. "We don't want to let our problems out. But we are having a terrible time. The tourists want to see Chinatown, but we need help." 
Ms. Cheung sat with Ms. Ng and Waichee Tang, another laid-off worker, at 193 Centre Street. The bustling sidewalks outside the door were superficially cheerful, stands bursting with fruit, vegetables, fresh fish. Children's silk outfits and toys dangled from the doorways of tiny shops. But the women walking in the door, carrying babies or stooped from years of grueling work, have few prospects. As union members and American citizens, Ms. Tang and Ms. Ng are relatively lucky.
Ms. Tang, 54, said 2 of her 30 co-workers at the textile factory Zoom Zoom in Chinatown who lost their jobs have found work. In her last year of work, as a seamstress and an inspector, she made $400 a week.
Her husband is in bad health and has no medical insurance, and her 25-year-old son, who lives with them in Brooklyn, had lost his computer job even before Sept. 11. 
"It's difficult," Ms. Tang said. "I worry. I am scared."
She, Ms. Cheung and Ms. Ng said they liked the garment industry campaign started last month by business executives and union officials to promote clothing made in New York. A red, white and blue logo saying "Proudly Made in New York" can now be found on tens of thousands of garments sold by the Bill Blass Collection, Nicole Miller, Elie Tahari, Brooks Brothers, Leslie Fay and Lafayette 148. 
Those names are easier to remember than those of Wai Chun Ng, Waichee Tang and Lana Cheung.

HEADLINE: ECONOMIC VIEW; 
What the Fed Can't Do About This Recession

BYLINE:  By LOUIS UCHITELLE 

 BODY:
MONETARY policy could not be better. The Federal Reserve has reduced interest rates so aggressively that lenders are almost giving away money. The economy should be rising again in response to so much easy credit. It is not rising, but there is some response, which helps to explain why the current, potentially severe recession is still a mild one. 
 This is an uncommon recession. It has arrived after a period of great plenty and excessive investment; surfeit seems to reign and indebtedness surely does. People turn away from the marketplace unless the offer is truly tempting. Car sales, the most glaring example, would not be booming today, or even above water, without zero-interest loans, which the Fed makes possible. Without its rate cuts, the car companies could not borrow cheaply enough to bear the losses from zero-interest lending for as long as they have. 
 Similar dynamics show up elsewhere, in each case helping to prevent the recession that started last spring from producing more hardship and unemployment. Because of the rate cuts, for example, consumer confidence held up until September, when layoffs finally unnerved the public, according to Richard Curtin, director of the University of Michigan's monthly consumer surveys. 
Home sales and home construction owe their persistent strength to 30-year mortgages at 6 percent interest, unimaginable last fall. As mortgage rates fell, families that already owned homes refinanced them and pocketed the savings from the lower monthly payments. Or they took out low-interest home equity loans and paid off high-interest credit card debt, again freeing money that they either saved or used for another stab at spending -- perhaps the last stab.
Some economists have tried to quantify the benefit to the economy from the Fed's 10 rate cuts since Jan. 1. The gross domestic product, the standard measure of economic activity, contracted in the third quarter at an annual rate of 0.4 percent. Once all the data is collected for that quarter, the rate of decline will probably turn out to be 1 to 2 percent, according to Peter Hooper, chief domestic economist at Deutsche Bank North America.
"That 1 to 2 percent would have been 3 to 4 percent" without the cuts, he said.
The rate cuts have helped in other ways to keep the economy from coming apart. The dollar, for example, has been rising against other currencies, making American products more expensive overseas and thus less competitive. But the rise would have been even greater without the sharp decline in interest rates. Low rates make dollar investments less desirable, so presumably fewer people buy dollars, although in these uncertain times there is still plenty of demand for the safety of America's currency.
Then there is the spread, which provides what may be the most important stimulus from the Fed's aggressive rate-cutting. The Fed manipulates the so-called federal funds rate, the interest that banks and other financial institutions pay to borrow money from each other for the short term. These borrowings are then lent to companies and individuals. With the federal funds rate now at 2 percent, down from 6.5 percent on Jan. 1, the nation's lenders have plenty of incentive to borrow short term at 2 percent and to lend long term at 4.5 percent or higher.
Mortgages offer a particularly juicy spread, and if potential customers hesitate -- because they are nervous about their jobs and about home prices -- then lenders can lure them by lowering mortgage rates a few more notches while still reaping an adequate spread. With the federal funds rate at its current level, the 30-year mortgage can go as low as 4 or 4.5 percent, in the view of Albert Wojnilower, a Wall Street economist.
LIKE many forecasters, Mr. Wojnilower expects the economy to rebound by next summer. The Fed's rate-cutting will help to make that happen, he and others say. But there are two areas where monetary policy normally works to lift the economy out of hard times, yet is not working now. 
Businesses usually take advantage of falling rates to step up investment. That spending normally gives the economy a powerful lift. But in this recession, there is so much excess capacity, thanks to the excesses of the 1990's, that companies resist. They fail to see a gain in profits from new investment, no matter how cheap credit gets. And the shock from the bursting of the high-tech bubble makes everyone a wary and reluctant borrower.
The Federal Reserve, in sum, lacks the power this time to lift America out of recession. Help is essential -- from government spending or lower oil prices or some wondrous new technology or economic revival abroad. And soon, before the federal funds rate gets to zero.

Land Rover Franchise Opens With a Gift to Red Cross

BYLINE:  By Marek Fuchs

 BODY:
Though the economy is retrenching, Thomas Coughlin is not. Already an owner of nine auto franchises, he just opened a 10th: Land Rover Larchmont/New Rochelle, at 1 East Main Street. 
"All of our projects are moving forward," said Mr. Coughlin, who explained that the opening had been in the works for years and, besides, his conviction is to build in slow times to reap the full benefits of the recovery.
 "There is an old concept on Wall Street about weak hands and strong hands," said Howard Mosher, the president of Land Rover North America. "Weak hands give up in hard times, but strong hands don't and it's the strong hands that do better long-term." 
 At the showroom's grand opening, Mr. Coughlin presented the American Red Cross of Westchester with a new Land Rover. 
Mr. Coughlin said that to promote the opening of the showroom, he wanted to donate a vehicle. "For decades and decades the Red Cross has been there for us," he said. "Why not be there for them?" Marek Fuchs

 New Jersey Transit has been diverting money intended for capital improvements to pay daily operating costs for at least the last decade, creating a financial crisis, according to a Rutgers study. 
The agency has not increased fares for 11 years and has not received enough money from the state to cover operating expenses, the study said. New Jersey Transit does not plan fare increases for now, Jeffrey Warsh, its executive director, said, but would ask the state for more money. Karen DeMasters

CAMDEN TAKEOVER

BYLINE:  By Karen DeMasters 

 BODY:
 A Senate committee last week took the first step toward the state's assuming control of Camden, with its financial problems and high crime rate. 
The Senate Economic Growth, Agriculture and Tourism Committee unanimously passed a bill that would provide $173 million for Camden in exchange for granting a court-appointed master to control some aspects of city operations for at least five years. If the bill, which has bipartisan sponsorship, is to pass, it must be before the end of the current session Jan. 8. Acting Governor Donald T. DiFrancesco, who also leaves office that day, has said he supported the bill. Karen DeMasters

A Parents' Party? Make a Wish

BYLINE:  By Bob Morris 

 BODY:
Thanksgiving has come and gone, but I'm still getting over Veterans Day. Two of the most stoic veterans I know, my parents, who have endured marriage despite the odds, got hitched on Nov. 11, 1951. For their 50th wedding anniversary, something elaborate was in order. But what? A surprise party at the Rainbow Room? Nope. We already did that for my mom's 70th birthday -- for 75 guests -- three years ago, when we felt flush with the economy.
 A big festive dinner for 50? Nope. All their best friends have migrated to Florida. Go somewhere warm? Well, Mom's fragile health doesn't allow her to fly, and my dad feels he eats too much on cruises. The old school Greenbrier resort in West Virginia? Too far. The Equinox in Vermont? Too cold. 
 The milestone had become a millstone. 
Who isn't in the middle of something like this these days? Never mind the immense logistics of holiday planning. Anyone with aging parents now has arrived at a place where milestones to be marked are coming up more frequently than jury duty. First, it's a 60th birthday, then a 25th anniversary, and it just keeps going from there into eternity, it seems. 
For the first half of our lives, parents gave us the parties, and now it's time for us to give them back, even if nobody is actually feeling up to it. "I often ask myself, who are these events really for?" said Sonya Friedman, a psychologist who offers advice as "The Party Doctor" on Party 411, a Web site. "Very often, the person you're honoring has a completely different idea of the ideal occasion. You give them a big party and suddenly they're stuck worrying if everyone's having a good time." She suggests thinking more "out of the box" when planning.
It seems like good advice, except for the fact that there are often strident siblings involved, and they might not see it the way you do. I have one friend who thought that renting a house on Cape Cod for the whole family was enough of a way to mark his parents' 50th anniversary. But his sister thought he and his brother also needed to plan a huge dinner party for friends of the family and buy Mom a diamond necklace.
"And my sister's the one who doesn't have a job," he said. 
Another friend has an "extremist" older sister who is tyrannical about family events. "Three years before my parents' 25th anniversary, when I was totally broke," she said, "my sister made all the siblings contribute to a fund in the bank for a surprise party, which wasn't exactly a success, since my mother arrived in a house dress."
Next week, in between shuttling around for all the holidays, her entire family is required to attend the 40th birthday party the extremist sister is giving for her husband in Palo Alto, Calif. "I volunteered to make the centerpieces and got two florists involved," said my friend, a former caterer. "But my sister didn't like what we were planning and fired me."
She's in charge of doing a cheer with pompoms instead. 
Novelty, of course, is always part of the proceedings. Magazines are filled with bossy, time-consuming ideas -- producing a video documentary, for instance, or making a memory quilt or digging up the budget and menu from the original wedding to display.
My favorite "out of the box" option is a comedy cruise departing from Sydney, Australia, which puts the anniversary celebrants through a ceremony in which they are "sentenced" to 50 more years of marriage as padlocks are placed on their fingers and "Yesterday" is played instead of a hymn. 
In her role as party doctor, Dr. Friedman, who used to have a show on CNN called "Sonya Live," and now has a private practice in Birmingham, Mich., monitors a good deal of pre-traumatic stress for families planning anniversary parties. Should there be a Money Tree for guests to help pay for the party? (No.) If one sibling is doing all the organizing, should he or she be allowed to contribute less? (Maybe.) For anniversary couples who don't get along? Invite as many guests as possible to keep spirits high. 
The whole thing really scratches her blackboard. "Give me a facelift instead of a party any time," Dr. Friedman said. 
But what if your unassuming parents would actually like a party? 
A few weeks before the date, after many plans had been scrapped, I booked us a banquet table at Sammy's Roumanian restaurant on the Lower East Side. It isn't the Greenbrier, but it has its own old-school character, with seltzer bottles and chopped liver made with real chicken fat (schmaltz) placed, like a threat to public health, at each table. 
Nothing went right that night. President Bush was in town (not for us) so traffic was horrendous. My brother showed up so late with the elaborate place cards made by my niece that our 20 guests were already seated.
My parents were an hour late, but the Israeli keyboard player didn't know it, and I couldn't get to him in time to make him stop wishing them a happy anniversary, and playing their wedding song. He wasn't playing klezmer music on his accordion, either, though I had negotiated for it at length in advance. And the additional musician I booked to add more old-fashioned flavor to the evening wasn't playing clarinet as promised, although it's my dad's favorite instrument. 
"He'll like the saxophone just as much," he assured me. I almost killed him.
The place was noisy, the food dodgy, the decor totally unacceptable.
Yet halfway through my second vodka and third mini-stroke, I looked up from my plate and saw my parents dancing in the middle of the crowded restaurant, between tables, like two kids slow-dancing at a prom. And despite the fact that my mother struggles to get in and out of a car, she and my dad were totally tickled by the stretch limo we packed too full of guests and Champagne. Later, at my brother's uptown apartment, while I accompanied them on the piano, my little niece and nephew performed a tribute I had written, set, appropriately enough, to "The Battle Hymn of the Republic."
Indeed, the marriage marches on, and the night was a success, mostly because we made it our business to be there and bear witness. No, we didn't rent a castle or have any royals there, but the thing about parents is that their kids are usually royalty enough. 
"The most important thing to remember if you give a party," said Dr. Friedman, "is to let it have heart." Despite the odds, ours did, I guess. 
And that isn't chopped liver. Although we had that, too.

A Corporate Believer's Turnabout

BYLINE:  By J. SUZANNE McCOY 

 BODY:
YOUNG David C. Korten would be shocked to see himself now.
 He can still remember how, as a politically conservative undergraduate at Stanford in the 1950's, he believed that American capitalism would save the world from poverty. Now he organizes protests and seminars against what he calls the evils of global corporate expansion. 
 Dr. Korten, 64, has become a leading figure in the antiglobalization movement, the diverse groups who first grabbed the public's attention in a big way when they disrupted world trade talks in Seattle two years ago. 
But he is no bomb thrower. (In fact, during most of the Seattle protest, he said, he was ill in bed and never marched in the streets.) What distinguishes him among the movement's thinkers, friends and critics say, is that he has an extensive background in how business is done in the developing world.
For three decades, after receiving his M.B.A. and a doctoral degree in business from Stanford, he taught at Harvard Business School, trained business managers in Africa and Central America and helped dispense financial aid in Asia.
His metamorphosis into a globalization opponent, he said in an interview, came gradually. But even he is startled by the before-and-after contrast. At Stanford, he said, "I was an active Young Republican." 
Critics call Dr. Korten a misguided idealist whose view of how companies should operate is unfair and outdated. His 1995 book, "When Corporations Rule the World," contends that multinational companies behave with little accountability and hold tyrannical power over the future of undeveloped countries. 
The book has become a bible of the movement -- protesters at a World Bank meeting in Washington last year carried a banner urging people to read it. More than 100,000 copies have been sold, and it is required reading in many college business and political economy courses.
Largely because of that book, Worth magazine listed Dr. Korten in its October 2001 issue as one of the "100 people who have changed the way Americans think about money."
Dr. Korten now devotes much of his time to the International Forum on Globalization, a group that helped to organize the Seattle protest. He also founded two groups, the Positive Futures Network and the People-Centered Development Forum, that advocate changes in global trade policy and corporate conduct. Dr. Korten spoke about his proposals at a conference in New York's Rutgers Presbyterian Church a few weeks ago, as global trade talks were under way in Qatar.
As a psychology major at Stanford, Dr. Korten said the subject of economics interested him because it influenced people's behavior. As a senior, he enrolled in a seminar called "Modern Revolutions" and decided that poverty, not political ideology, caused rebellions.
"I concluded that the best thing I could do was go to business school and bring the secrets of modern American management to the third world," he said. "And from there unfolded a compulsive need to ask questions." 
He established a management school in Ethiopia while he earned his Ph.D., then joined the Harvard Business School faculty to work at the Harvard-backed Central American Management Institute in Nicaragua. In 1978, he and his wife, Frances F. Korten, whom he had met at Stanford, moved to Southeast Asia and administered aid programs for the Ford Foundation and the United States Agency for International Development.
He said the aggressive expansion of American corporations into impoverished countries, going wherever labor was cheapest, increasingly troubled him. He recalled looking out his office window in Manila, where he worked from 1988 to 1992, watching as enclaves of executives flew in helicopters and clogged the streets with cars while the air filled with diesel exhaust. Outside that same window, he could watch people living in shacks atop a garbage dump.
Those disparities were the catalyst for a life change. In 1992, he decided to move to New York, where he thought he could more directly influence industry leaders. He devoted himself to writing his book, giving speeches and encouraging the nascent antiglobalization movement.
His speeches, mostly to environmental groups and antiglobalization teach-ins, drew increasingly large audiences, including representatives of businesses. After a speech in St. Louis in 1997, he was invited to visit Monsanto, a developer of genetically modified foods and a prime target of globalization critics. Dr. Korten began corresponding with Robert Shapiro, then Monsanto's chief executive. They even sent books to each other. But the friendship ended there.
Dr. Korten said that he still regarded Monsanto as "one of the most evil corporations" and that Mr. Shapiro, pressured for profits and a strong stock price, had deluded himself into thinking that genetically modified foods would help the world's poor.
Asked for his opinion of Dr. Korten, Mr. Shapiro said in an e-mail message, "I think he's a thoughtful man with fine intentions and values, but I continue to disagree with some of his premises and most of his conclusions." 
John Cavanagh, a friend of Dr. Korten's and director of the Institute for Policy Studies, a research center in Washington, said Dr. Korten had helped to blunt a major criticism of the movement -- that it lacks a clear analysis of globalization's consequences.
"Amongst economists the line was, 'Globalization is inevitable, get with the program,' " Mr. Cavanagh said. "David has helped change the debate with the argument that this version of globalization isn't inevitable."
But many economists reject Dr. Korten's view that globalization is self-destructive and is incapable of paying attention to side effects like environmental damage. 
"People were talking in the early 19th century about the collapse of capitalism," Dr. Alice H. Amsden, professor of political economy at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. "But during these periods, changes are made, institutional rules are amended and new organizations appear that, in a sense, strengthen capitalism for the next period of economic growth and development." 
Dr. Korten describes his vision of the future as a network of locally and cooperatively owned businesses. The Kortens live on Bainbridge Island, Wash., a spot in the Puget Sound near Seattle that Dr. Korten calls the "land of ecotopia." He can practice some of his suggestions here, he said, like buying wine from producers he knows personally.
He acknowledged his need for some accouterments of the American economy -- flying in airplanes and using computers and e-mail. He thinks a scaled-down economy won't be so dependent on them. "I have no illusion about any of the change process being easy," he said.

It'sNot Grandma's Clearance Sale. It's Online and Worth Billions.

BYLINE:  By DAVID J. WALLACE 

 BODY:
"EVEN our mistakes are edible" is the slogan at Johnny's Po Boys, a New Orleans sandwich shop. Other retailers make mistakes, too, and they hope to make them more palatable to consumers by using the Internet to unload their returned, refurbished, damaged or overstocked merchandise.
 Clearance sales have moved online, with more rapid sales at better prices and with fewer middlemen, allowing retailers and manufacturers to recoup more on such goods than they could a decade ago. And with the economy weak, consumers who are short of cash may prefer returned goods in plain brown cardboard boxes over brand new, more expensive merchandise in shiny packages. 
 Billions of dollars in returned goods, close outs, overstocks and other orphaned merchandise are now for sale on the Internet. Consumers benefit from low prices and their computers' ability to sort through piles of merchandise quickly. Although some products retain their manufacturer's warranties, others do not, so a "buyer beware" caution is important.
The options are many, for both retailers and consumers. An online retailer may sell returned goods that have been tested for quality. Some sites offer auction areas, generally for merchandise that is in good condition, often carrying a warranty.
At the other end of the spectrum, dissatisfied consumers can use eBay or Yahoo auctions as their returns desk of last resort, where caveat emptor is the rule.
Then there are the online sellers of equipment that is slightly used but still serviceable and new merchandise that is past its season.
Computer equipment and consumer electronics are among the most popular goods rejected by their first buyers. For consumers seeking the latest merchandise, returned goods often sell at discounts.
Retailers, manufacturers and even liquidators have set up Web sites to reach consumers. One Web site, ReturnBuy.com, relieves the retailer and the manufacturer of the trouble of dealing with returns. The company's warehouse in South Carolina accepts returned products on behalf of the seller or manufacturer, and sells on consignment through online auctions. "No one wants these goods back," said Jeffrey Rogers, co-founder and chief financial officer of ReturnBuy. "It's a marketing, sales and logistics problem all rolled into one."
ReturnBuy currently sells its merchandise via eBay and Yahoo auctions. Employees rate goods from one star to five stars -- on appearance, packaging condition and other criteria -- so shoppers have an idea of what they are buying. Products are tested for performance, but all sales are final, unless the consumer receives the wrong shipment. Mr. Rogers would not disclose revenue or profitability for the company, which is privately held, but he said computers made up 60 percent of its sales.
"Electronics are commodity items and there aren't enough of them on eBay," he said. "For a Sony Vaio laptop with certain specifications, we know what words to put in the description, when to start the auction, when to end it. We can post something in one day and sell it within three days. For hot items, we'll get close to retail."
Returns are rare for flawed large appliances, because the manufacturer often finds it less expensive to send a repair technician than to pay to have the product sent back. Consumer electronics average single-digit return rates, while up to half of apparel may bounce back because of fast-moving fashion trends and seasonal timing.
Televisions are particularly popular clearance items, said Walt Mulvey, the chief executive of goodguys.com, an online electronics seller. Their specifications or prices can be compared quickly and easily.
"It's a great opportunity for consumers," he said. "There's so much information about products that a search engine makes it simple. Consumers can accomplish a search for a clearance item in a half-hour online, what might have taken a week in bricks-and-mortar stores."
THE overall market size of returned retail goods is unknown, but Mr. Rogers estimates that $62 billion in consumer goods are turned back annually. Definitions of returns vary widely across industries, depending on merchandise and consumer protection laws. Some products might be in sealed boxes. Others might be opened but unused or cosmetically flawed, so they might not be sold as new.
On the other hand, consumers may be buying a proverbial lemon that no one else wants. Buyers are advised to look closely at a product's details. Some people might sell merchandise like car seats or toys online despite a manufacturer's recall. 
Still, the Internet is likely to make returns more crucial to shoppers and sellers, said Randy Covill, the senior retail analyst at AMR Research in Boston. "It's a change in mind-set," he said. "This used to be a loss -- a cost of doing business. But in the multichannel world, maybe a good result can come of it."

It showed that the need for relief is not limited to the area below Canal Street. 
 The devastating effects of Sept. 11 on working-poor families are seen and felt daily in the Chinatown community and do not magically disappear north of Canal Street. To heal the community as a whole, it is simply insufficient to define those in need based on their geographic location; we must examine the suffering on the ground.

HEADLINE: INVESTING WITH/Peter F. Spano; 
Preferred International Value Fund

BYLINE:  By CAROLE GOULD 

 BODY:
PETER F. SPANO named his firm, Mercator Asset Management, for Gerardus Mercator, the 16th-century cartographer whose world map helped sailors navigate the globe.
 "Our business is making global projections as well, in terms of companies' earnings growth rates, which drives our investment process," said Mr. Spano, who also manages the $166 million Preferred International Value fund. 
 The fund returned 4.1 percent a year, on average, for the three years ended Thursday, compared with a 1.1 percent loss for its foreign stock group, according to Morningstar Inc. It lost 7.9 percent in the last 12 months, versus a 21.7 percent decline for its group, Morningstar said. 
Mr. Spano, 58, is founder and general partner of Mercator, which manages about $2.5 billion for institutions and is based in Fort Lauderdale, Fla. Mercator runs the fund for Caterpillar Investment Management, a subsidiary of Caterpillar Inc., the heavy equipment maker. The subsidiary provides investment advisory services for the Preferred Group of Mutual Funds.
Mr. Spano describes himself as a "relative value" investor. "We're willing to pay a little more than deep-value investors when we see good earnings growth going forward and catalysts for change," he said.
He works with five analysts to pick about 50 stocks from among roughly 2,500 companies outside the United States with market capitalizations of at least $800 million.
Every three months, they rank the stocks based on multiples of price to earnings, cash flow and book value over the last three to five years, and on projected five-year earnings growth. After this screening, Mr. Spano does further research, reviewing the company's prospects, industry and economic environment. He also prefers companies with little debt. On average, the companies in the portfolio have projected earnings growth of 11 to 12 percent for the next three to five years.
He trims a holding when it exceeds 5 percent of the fund's assets or if the earnings outlook deteriorates.
To control risk, Mr. Spano aims for a diversified portfolio spanning about 15 countries and 25 industries. Emerging-markets investments are limited to 10 percent; they are at 5 percent, all in South Korea, where, he said, the government is stable, the currency is strong and there are undervalued blue-chip companies.
Mr. Spano bought shares of Samsung Electronics, the South Korean electronics giant, in January at an average price of 195,550 won, worth $154 at the time, including transaction costs. They closed on Friday at 216,000 won, or $169.08. Samsung, which offers a broad range of products, including memory chips, televisions, and microwave ovens, "has technological leadership and joint ventures with other electronics companies that hopefully will ensure strong demand" for years, he said. Its strong balance sheet will provide a cushion during the economic slowdown, he added, projecting earnings growth of more than 20 percent a year for the next three to five years.
The ebbing fortunes of the automobile industry prompted him to buy shares of DaimlerChrysler in July at 55.56 euros, then worth $44.82, including transaction costs. On Friday they closed at 47 euros, which he valued at $41.32, including costs.. He expects long-term annual earnings growth of 16 percent based on factors like cost-cutting at Chrysler in the United States and new, lower-priced automobiles from Mercedes in Germany. "The way the market is valuing the company," he said, "you can buy Daimler-Benz and get Chrysler for nothing."
In August, he bought shares of Abitibi-Consolidated, a newsprint producer based in Montreal, at $11.54 (Canadian), or $7.20 at the time. They now trade at $10.76 (Canadian), or $6.72. The stock price is depressed, he said, because of reduced demand as a result of the economic slowdown. But he expects long-term earnings growth to average 18 percent a year for the next three to five years. The company has closed higher-cost production sites, decreasing its capacity, he said, adding, "We think the company will be well placed to benefit from the future upturn in advertising volume and demand."

HEADLINE: Dot-Com Is Dot-Gone, And the Dream With It 

BYLINE:  By JOHN SCHWARTZ 

 BODY:
MARK LEIBOVICH recalled the day in 1999 when he showed up early for an appointment at a Washington dot-com. Mr. Leibovich, a reporter for The Washington Post, was there to interview the company's executives. "I got there just in time to see the C.E.O. himself wheeling a foosball table into the lobby" to give the impression that the high-tech firm possessed the desired quantum of wackiness that its Silicon Valley counterparts are famous for.
 That is so over, and so much more over, even, than before. The popular obsession with the dot-com revolution, fading for more than a year, seems to have simply winked out since mid-September, as firemen and warriors have become the new heroes, and e-commerce's whiz kids are consigned to the cultural boneyard. 
 Not much more than a year ago, boosters of the New Economy and their true believers in the press were claiming to have changed all the rules. Not just in tech-fetish magazines like Wired, but in self-styled cultural arbiters like New York magazine, which declared the 1990's the "e-Decade." In a 1999 cover story, the essayist Michael Wolff -- himself a failed dot-com executive -- announced a brave new world. "There is, at the elusive center of the e-experience, the fantasy that we might become free of economic laws," he wrote. "All it takes to make otherworldly riches is the will and desire." It wasn't enough to make money. They had to make history.
Now they themselves are history. Each day, the old idols seem to fade further into the dim past, barely recollected in a country where the languages of "revolution" and "warfare" are no longer just business metaphors. This is the next step after the bursting of the dot-com economic bubble -- the bursting of the cultural bubble, the end of the nerd as a crossover hit, of the I.P.O. zillionaire as role model to college students.
The changing of the guard can be seen in little things. Like Henry Blodget, the industry analyst who became famous for predicting early that Amazon.com would reach $400 a share, announcing that he is taking a buyout and leaving Merrill Lynch at the grand old age of 35. 
Like the growing wave of books that focus not on the dot-com path to riches but on the wild plunge into the abyss. Having failed to sell their dreams, they are now attempting to sell their failure. A documentary of the rise and fall of a Silicon Alley company was chronicled in "Startup.Com" by Sebastian Nokes, released last winter. Books by former dot-com executives are arriving in stores. Two of the first are "A Very Public Offering: A Rebel's Story of Business Excess, Success, and Reckoning" by Stephan Paternot, founder of Theglobe.com, and "Dot.bomb: My Days and Nights at an Internet Goliath," by J. David Kuo. Another is coming soon: "Boo Hoo," the chronicle of the spectacular failure of Boo.com, the luxury fashion site that burned through $185 million of its investors' cash and had an online life of just six months, told by its profligate founders.
Did we mention that Mr. Blodget is writing a book?
For the most part, however, the flood of dot-com failure stories is being met with a national yawn. The tell-all books have bounced around the Amazon.com rankings without making inroads into best-seller territory. And why not? Because former idols have feet of clay. In "A Very Public Offering," a book written as amateurishly as the company was run, did we need the image of Mr. Paternot dancing the night away in plastic pants? 
Ellen DeGeneres's new sitcom, "The Ellen Show," is built around the notion of an executive returning to her hometown after the collapse of her dot-com, but the show sits at the miserable ranking of 93rd for the season -- behind "Emeril," the celebrity chef comedy -- despite Ms. DeGeneres's own considerable appeal.
To Amitai Etzioni, a sociologist at George Washington University, the country is experiencing an abrupt cultural shift away from the libertarian, individualistic values that were expressed in the celebration of the New Economy and toward more old-fashioned values in the wake of the terrorist attacks, when government is not The Problem and people are not The Market. "There's been a sea change," he said. The surge in charitable giving and blood donations after Sept. 11, he said, underscores "the sense that you're willing to give priority to the common good, to public safety and public health." 
Paulina Borsook, the author of "Cyberselfish," a critical look at dot-com values published last year, said: "People really crave a reminder of human bonds that have to do with sacrifice and fellowship and getting to know each other over time. It's not about changing jobs every six months and getting stock options."
In the 90's, college students hoping to emulate Marc Andreessen of Netscape and other geek stars migrated to Silicon Valley or New York's Silicon Alley with thin resumes and visions of Testarossas dancing in their heads. That's all changing, said Thomas T. Field, director of the Center for the Humanities at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County. "Many of the young adults that I see coming to campus now say they want fulfilling jobs, not just ways of earning money," he said. "Sounds awfully familiar, when you come from the 60's generation." 
Professor Field suggested that protests over globalism, and the sense of security that flourished during the boom, made young people more willing to question the status quo and to take chances. During the I.P.O. frenzy, he said, students could not wait to get out of school and begin earning. This year, many of his students have chosen to study abroad in China, Nepal, India and Egypt. 
The country is in dot-com denial, Ms. Borsook said, adding, "No one wants to admit that they were caught up in it," an attitude she calls "I don't want to think that I drank the Kool-Aid."
Good riddance, said Thomas Frank, the author of "One Market Under God: Extreme Capitalism, Market Populism and the End of Economic Democracy." The book is a withering attack on the ideas underlying the selling of the New Economy, which he says co-opted hipness and the language of populism to serve greed and gain. The book has come out in paperback with a new afterword. "It's going to take some time for it to sink in," Mr. Frank said. "The Dow isn't going to go to 36,000, and the dot-coms aren't going to come back -- and a lot of people lost a lot of money."
Though dot-com executives might seem irrelevant these days, the technologies they sold, by and large, are not, pointed out Paul Saffo, an analyst at the Institute for the Future in Menlo Park, Calif. "People haven't stopped using the Internet," he said. "The fact is that it is changing the world, and it has changed the world." People now expect to be able to buy a book or make an airline reservation in the middle of the night, "and it's washed into the rest of their lives."
Kevin Kelly, who as a longtime editor of Wired magazine helped create the heroic ethos surrounding dot-com entrepreneurs, acknowledged "it came tumbling down with the towers." But Mr. Kelly insisted that these people would rise again. The generation of tyro executives who crashed and burned "got better business education than they could if they had gotten a Harvard M.B.A.," he said. "They didn't set out to learn, but, boy, they are much smarter now." He predicts that the last decade has been the "layup" for a true cultural revolution to come -- he could not be specific, and his words may strike many as more dot-com hyperbole.
It takes a special kind of gall for the same people who argued that the "long boom" suspended the laws of economics, and even unraveled the cycles of history, to fall back now on analysis of historical cycles to support their arguments. 
But to believe any less goes against the American grain, argued Jason McCabe Calacanis, the editor of the now-defunct Silicon Alley Reporter. The dot-commer, seen today as a scam artist, will be reborn, he said, smarter and tougher, because he represents optimism itself. "It's the belief that the future -- the individual's future and the future of the economy -- are going to be better in five years than they are today."
But still. Take a look at the book "Radical E" by Glenn Rifkin and Joel Kurtzman, which offers "Lessons on How to Rule the Web" after the bust. It extols companies that truly understand how to marry the World Wide Web to business. "After five tumultuous years of hype and hysteria," the authors promise, "the real advent of the Web and e-business is now."
One of the book's chief examples of a company that does it right, Enron, has been in the news a lot lately, though not because of astute exploitation of e-commerce. No, Enron -- which trades energy via the Web -- has seen its stock collapse 90 percent.

CORRECTION-DATE: December 2, 2001

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, an article last Sunday about the end of the cultural fascination for the dot-com revolution referred incorrectly to "Startup.com," a documentary film on the rise and fall of a Silicon Alley company. It was directed by Jehane Noujaim and Chris Hegedus, not Sebastian Nokes. Mr. Nokes is the author of a similarly titled book, "Startup.Com," whose subtitle is "Everything You Need to Know About Starting Up an Internet Company." The book and film are unrelated.

Re "Mrs. Bush Cites Women's Plight Under Taliban" (news article, Nov. 18): 
 Laura Bush hopes to ensure dignity and opportunity for the women and children of Afghanistan. 
That is commendable. But it would be a tragedy if our zeal to improve the situation in Afghanistan led us to overlook equally needy women and children in other parts of the world. 
 An important first step to help these women and children would be to increase the amount of money that the United States allots for foreign aid: only 0.1 percent of gross national product, of which an infinitesimal amount goes to the health and education programs that directly benefit women and children. A second step would be for the United States to abandon its conservative positions on women's reproductive rights in foreign policy and United Nations negotiations.

HEADLINE: A Boom Built Upon Sand, Gone Bust 

BYLINE:  By ALEX BERENSON 

DATELINE: LAURENS, S.C. 

 BODY:
THE trailer is white and narrow, a starter model with black shutters. It sits off a wooded road outside this rundown town, which missed most of the last decade's boom but is catching every bit of this year's bust.
 The trailer is deserted but not empty. Dirty pans fill the sink. Trash overflows a blue plastic bin. Tiny shoes, a broken stroller and a small book titled "God's Gift to Mothers" are strewn across the stained green carpet. A baby doll lies lost on the floor. 
 The trailer was financed by Conseco in 1998 and repossessed by Conseco in 2001. This is how easy money looks, three years later. 
Most of America never noticed, but the 1990's were good times for trailer homes, a k a manufactured housing. From 1991 to 1998, annual sales of manufactured homes more than doubled, to 374,000 from 174,000.
One company, one man and one accounting rule drove that growth.
Green Tree Financial, a Minnesota lender, financed more than 40 percent of all manufactured homes sold in the United States during the industry's peak. Lawrence M. Coss ran Green Tree as chairman and chief executive, taking home $200 million in pay during the boom.
The rule, a rarely used accounting convention called "gain on sale," encouraged Green Tree to make as many loans as possible and allowed it to report more than $2 billion in profits that never existed.
To meet the surge in demand created by Green Tree, home manufacturers opened scores of factories. Thousands of dealers, who sold the homes, set up lots nationwide. In the South in particular, manufactured homes proliferated, and in South Carolina, the epicenter of the boom, they made up more than half of all new homes sold in 1997 and 1998.
In their rush to lend, Green Tree and its rivals made loans to borrowers who had little chance of paying them back. Tens of thousands of those people have already defaulted and have been evicted. Conseco alone has repossessed 25,000 homes so far this year, after a record 28,466 in 2000. By the time the industry's hangover ends later this decade, hundreds of thousands more low-income borrowers will lose their homes. They will wind up with huge debts and ruined credit because their homes are worth far less than what they owe.
Green Tree is now Conseco Finance, the lending arm of Conseco, the financial company based in Carmel, Ind. Mr. Coss, who did not return calls seeking comment, retired in 1998 and owns a ranch in River Falls, Wis. Gain-on-sale accounting has been relegated to the dustbin of finance.
The manufactured housing industry, meanwhile, is foundering. Only about 180,000 new homes will be sold this year. Factories are closing as quickly as they opened during the fat years, and tens of thousands of jobs are gone. Dealers are shuttering, too. In South Carolina alone, the number has fallen to less than 400 from a peak of 620 in 1998.
"Greed overcame logic," said Walter R. Young Jr., chairman of Champion Enterprises, the largest maker of manufactured homes, a publicly traded company based in Auburn Hills, Mich. Builders and dealers share the blame for expanding too quickly, Mr. Young said, but without Green Tree and other finance companies, the boom would not have been possible.
"You always have to follow the cash," he said. "Loose money fans it, and everything got carried away."
THE future of Conseco, which makes loans and sells insurance mainly to middle- and low-income consumers, is also in doubt. After buying Green Tree in 1998, the company went on its own binge under Stephen C. Hilbert, its well-paid chairman. Conseco's spree peaked in 1999, when it financed $6.3 billion in new manufactured homes, 41 percent of the national total. But facing mounting losses from bad loans and a plunging stock price, Conseco's board forced out Mr. Hilbert in April 2000 and soon replaced him with Gary C. Wendt, the former chairman of GE Capital. Mr. Hilbert did not return calls.
This year, Conseco has cut back sharply on manufactured-home lending. But Conseco is still saddled with $26 billion in loans on trailer homes, including more than $20 billion from the days of Mr. Hilbert and Mr. Coss.
Many top Wall Street investors, including Carl C. Icahn, the onetime corporate raider, have sold Conseco's stock short, betting that it will fall. Losses on the trailer loans, along with problems at Conseco's insurance business, will bankrupt the company by the middle of next year, the short-sellers say.
"June of 2002 looks to be very hairy," said M. W. Montgomery of Rocker Partners, a hedge fund that has sold Conseco's shares short since the fall of 1999, when they traded above $20. "It's becoming clear to everybody that this game stops then, if not sooner."
According to Conseco's own projections, it will produce only about $800 million in cash from its operations next year -- yet it has $1.4 billion in debt and interest payments and dividends coming due. The bears say that the cash flow estimate is optimistic. Even if it proves accurate, Conseco, which already has more than $6 billion in debt and preferred stock, may have a hard time finding enough money to make up the difference. On Wednesday, Fitch, a bond rating agency, lowered its rating on Conseco Finance's debt to CCC, indicating "that default is a real possibility."
In an interview on Tuesday, Mr. Wendt said the company could easily meet its debt payments next year, by selling assets if necessary.
"These short-sellers have one thing in mind -- the destruction of the company," Mr. Wendt said. "We have a company that employs 13,500 people, and we want to continue to have a company that employs 13,500 people."
Mr. Wendt received a $45 million bonus and stock options for 10 million shares at $5.88 each when he joined Conseco in June 2000, and will receive 3.2 million shares if he remains chairman through June.
Last week, to bolster its case, Conseco presented investors in New York with a four-hour discussion of the company's finance business, focusing on its manufactured-home loans, which make up 60 percent of the loans on the company's books. The company said it had toughened its standards for new loans and had increased its reserves to cover potential losses on defaults.
Bruce Crittenden, chief executive of Conseco Finance, said the trailer home business was becoming more profitable. The interest rates that Conseco pays are falling, while the rates it charges borrowers have remained high, increasing the profit on each loan it makes.
"I believe in our model," Mr. Crittenden said.
But investors are unconvinced. Conseco's stock closed on Friday at $4.48. That is down 92 percent since Mr. Hilbert agreed to buy Green Tree in April 1998, costing the company's shareholders $18 billion.
FOR much of the last decade, Green Tree appeared to be one of Wall Street's great growth stocks. Its profits jumped sixfold, to $301 million, from 1991 to 1997. Its stock soared thirtyfold.
But Green Tree's profits were a mirage, made possible because of gain-on-sale accounting.
Like many other banks and finance companies, Green Tree used a process called securitization to resell its home loans to outside investors. Green Tree grouped thousands of these small loans into a pool worth hundreds of millions of dollars. It then divided that pool into a series of bonds and sold them, promising to pay interest on the bonds from the interest it collected on the loans.
Green Tree typically charged borrowers 12 percent to 13 percent interest and promised to pay its bondholders about 7 percent. The company, in the middle, made a profit on the difference. 
Trailer home borrowers, mostly near the bottom of the economic ladder, often default on their loans. It might seem odd that bond investors, who generally value safety, would buy bonds backed by such risky collateral as trailers. But in a securitization, losses from defaulted loans are not spread equally. Instead, the bonds are divided into "tranches," and one tranche must be repaid before payment on the next can begin. The bottom tranches are risky and pay higher interest, while the tranches that are repaid first are very safe.
Securitization provided Green Tree with ready access to capital from the bond buyers, and that enabled it to finance as many loans as it wanted. At the same time, gain-on-sale accounting allowed Green Tree to record income from every loan that it made.
Normally, banks record profits on loans only as they are repaid, whether they securitize the loans or hold them on their books. But when Green Tree finished a securitization, it calculated how much money it expected to make as the loans were paid back in the future. Then the company recorded that amount as profit, even though it would not be paid for many years. Essentially, Green Tree decreed that its loans would be profitable and put off worrying whether its forecasts had been right until later. Other financial companies that specialize in subprime lending also used such gain-on-sale accounting, but not to the extent that Green Tree did.
The combination of gain-on-sale and securitization meant that as long as Green Tree could find more borrowers, it could report higher profits, said Mr. Crittenden, the president of Conseco Finance.
"When you're running a gain-on-sale shop, it's based on volume," he said.
Mr. Crittenden joined Green Tree at the end of 1995, as the company expanded into home equity and credit card loans. He took over manufactured-housing loans in January 1999, after Mr. Coss retired. In September 1999, in response to pressure from investors, Conseco stopped using gain-on-sale accounting, switching to the more traditional method of booking profits only as the company is repaid.
SEEKING new borrowers under Mr. Coss, Green Tree went to places like Pensacola, Fla., where it opened an office in 1995 to service trailer home dealers in southern Alabama. Employees had a difficult time finding enough loans to make, said Tammy Weakley, who worked as a loan processor in the Pensacola office from 1995 to 1999.
To meet monthly targets set at Green Tree's headquarters, Ms. Weakley said the office would accept loans whose borrowers did not meet the company's credit criteria, especially near the end of each month.
"There was pressure," Ms. Weakley said. "The whole office was pushed to the maximum." (Ms. Weakley and two other employees in Pensacola have sued Green Tree, asserting that they were sexually harassed by a manager there.)
The loan situation was similar here in South Carolina, where dealers knew that Green Tree and other lenders would approve almost anyone who applied, according to dealers and people in the industry here. Many lenders made loans with as little as 5 percent down, say, $2,500 on a $50,000 home. Some financed loans with only $1,000 down.
"It was easy," said G. Mitchell Gault, a dealer in Mauldin, S.C. "The lenders were greedy as hell."
Mr. Gault said he thought that lenders "cared more about quotas than the quality of the loan."
Dealers, who could make $10,000 or more in profit on a $50,000 home, were not shy about signing up borrowers. If a would-be buyer could not come up with a down payment, the dealer might tell him to bring in a used gun worth $200 and buy it for $2,000, according to dealers and people in the industry. That money would then become the down payment.
"Some of these people didn't deserve to be a homeowner, and they were put in homes," Mr. Gault said.
William Ryan, an analyst at Ventana Capital in New York who covers financial companies, said Green Tree cut loan standards beginning in 1995. It made bigger loans, allowed lower down payments and accepted buyers with spotty credit histories, he said.
"These companies have a way of creating loan volume where none exists," Mr. Ryan said.
Other lenders lowered their standards, too. But Green Tree expanded faster than any of them. In 1992, it lent $1.2 billion to 43,000 borrowers for manufactured homes, accounting for about one in five trailer loans made that year, according to Securities and Exchange Commission filings and industry statistics. In 1996, Green Tree lent $4.8 billion to 143,000 borrowers. Three years later, Green Tree, at that point owned by Conseco, made $6.6 billion in loans, including $300 million on homes it had already repossessed.
Gain-on-sale accounting enabled Green Tree to book profits every time it securitized a basket of loans, and the company's earnings soared alongside its loans during the mid-1990's.
But those profits were not based on actual cash the company had taken in. They were an accounting fiction based on Green Tree's projections of the payments it would eventually receive, less its operating costs and its losses on repossessions.
In 1997, the fiction began to unravel. In calculating its future profits on a loan, Green Tree needed to estimate two crucial variables: the odds that borrowers would default and the odds that they would refinance and pay off loans in advance. Either would make the loans less profitable.
During Green Tree's expansion, short-sellers had argued that the company had underestimated the risks of prepayment and default. They were right. In November 1997, Green Tree began a long process of erasing most of the profits it had ever earned with a $190 million pretax write-off. A $200 million write-off followed in January 1998.
"We think at this time our assumptions are appropriate," Dale Redman, Green Tree's chief financial officer, said at the time of the second write-off.
Three months later, Green Tree sold itself to Conseco in a deal then valued at $7.6 billion in Conseco stock. Conseco's shares fell $8.63, to $49.13, after the deal was announced, as investors worried that Conseco did not understand the risks of buying Green Tree. During a conference call discussing the deal, Mr. Hilbert, Conseco's chairman, dismissed that possibility. "Wall Street sometimes takes a day or two to be fully enlightened," he said. The stock never regained its loss.
CONSECO quickly discovered that many of Green Tree's borrowers could not repay their loans. In July 1998, the company took a $549 million pretax write-off on Green Tree, which was renamed Conseco Finance.
Hoping to prove that the new acquisition could work, Conseco continued to use gain-on-sale accounting and actually increased the number of loans it made. But as the quality of the company's loans fell, borrowers defaulted even more quickly, forcing Conseco to write off profits almost as soon as it booked them.
Even after Conseco cut back last year on lending, the losses continued. Write-offs became an annual event, totaling $554 million in 1999, $516 million in 2000 and $315 million so far this year.
Between them, Green Tree and Conseco have written down Green Tree's pretax profits by $2.3 billion over the last four years. Add $500 million in other "special charges" related to Green Tree that Conseco has taken, and the write-downs wipe out all the pretax profits Green Tree and Conseco Finance earned over the last seven years.
"It's amazing to me how the shareholders of these companies actually believe the earnings per share, and they don't understand how that's accounted for," said Mr. Montgomery of Rocker Partners. "The overwhelming majority of the income which is being booked is a definite maybe sometime."
As the losses mounted in the first two years after the acquisition, Conseco's stock plunged almost 90 percent. On April 28, 2000, with the company's shares at $5.63, Mr. Hilbert quit. He received a $72 million severance package, including the right to use Conseco's private jet up to 20 times a year. All told, Mr. Hilbert's pay from 1993 to 2000 was $530 million.
Mr. Coss did not do quite as well. His pay, tied to Green Tree's reported profits, totaled about $200 million from 1993 to 1998, including a $30 million severance package.
IF those write-offs seem ugly, the reality on the ground is worse. In their rush to win borrowers, Green Tree and other lenders began offering 30-year mortgages instead of the 15-year terms that had been standard at the beginning of the 1990's. By 1997, the average Green Tree loan had a term of about 25 years, up from 13 years in 1987.
The longer mortgages lowered monthly payments slightly, enabling lenders to make more loans. But they greatly increased overall interest costs. On a typical $50,000 mortgage with a 13 percent interest rate, the monthly payment on a 15-year loan is $633, compared with $553 for a 30-year loan. But the longer loan costs a borrower an extra $85,000 in interest over the loan's life.
In addition, the principal balance on a high-interest 30-year loan shrinks very slowly during the first few years. After five years of payments on a $50,000, 30-year mortgage at 13 percent interest, the borrower has paid more than $32,000 in interest but still owes $49,000 in principal.
Yet unlike conventional houses, which often appreciate, manufactured homes quickly lose their value. After three years, the wholesale value of a manufactured home is about half its retail price.
As a result, borrowers face a difficult squeeze. They are not building equity, and if they sell their homes, they will probably find that they receive less than the amount they owe on their loans. 
Mr. Gault, the dealer, said demand for new homes had collapsed partly because homeowners who would like to move to larger trailers could not. "They started going 30 years on these single-wide homes," he said. "Once you live in a home two or three or four or five years, you want to upgrade and you can't upgrade. You're upside-down in it big time."
Because their homes are worth less than they owe, the owners have few options if they lose their jobs or face unexpected expenses, said Mark Tesh, credit counseling director for a nonprofit family counseling center in Greenville, S.C.
"A lot of times," Mr. Tesh said, "those folks are better off just filing for bankruptcy, so they can just start fresh."
He said his clients were often financially unsophisticated and focused only on their monthly payment, not the risks of signing a 30-year note on a wasting asset.
"A lot of folks that get into the mobile home scenario, they get into it initially because it's more affordable," he said. "They honestly don't realize that a mobile home is going to depreciate. Most of them learn the hard way."
MR. CRITTENDEN of Conseco said the move to 30-year mortgages made sense because the quality of manufactured housing had improved in the last decade. Trailers and conventional houses now share many materials and construction techniques. "This asset has a 50-year life minimum," he said. "The manufacturers have done an outstanding job with the quality of these homes."
Conseco, Mr. Crittenden said, also works closely with borrowers who face financial difficulty, including regularly granting loan extensions and sometimes even accepting reduced monthly payments. Tighter loan standards may also reduce defaults.
Still, Conseco projects that it will eventually repossess about one in five of the new manufactured homes it finances. On loans made on repossessed homes, which are aimed at even less creditworthy borrowers and can carry interest rates of 18 percent, Conseco figures on default rates of 50 percent, Mr. Crittenden said.
Those projections may comfort Wall Street, reducing investors' concerns that Conseco is underestimating its risks. But they offer little comfort for borrowers struggling to make their monthly payments.
Bonnie and Mitchell Turner, who live near Laurens, have given up struggling. In August 1999, the Turners bought a repossessed double-wide trailer with financing from Conseco. They wound up with mortgage and insurance payments of $618 and additional lot rent of $250.
The extra payments seemed manageable with Mrs. Turner working as a waitress and Mr. Turner as a carpenter. "I just wanted a house, my house," she said. "A place to retire in, hopefully."
But within months, the furnace failed, costing $1,500 to repair. Now Mrs. Turner has lost her job, and Mr. Turner's monthly take-home pay has fallen to about $2,000. With four children, the family has food and clothing costs, car payments and electricity bills that total almost $1,500. Even with their old rent of $380, the Turners' finances would be stretched to the breaking point. "The $618 is killing us," Mrs. Turner said. "We just can't do it."
The Turners, who stopped paying their mortgage in August, are waiting for Conseco to repossess their home. Mrs. Turner said she hopes the company won't foreclose until after Christmas.
"If my hindsight was my foresight," she added, "I would never have purchased it at all."

Will New York Be Told, Once Again, to Drop Dead?

BYLINE:  By ALEX BERENSON 

 BODY:
NEARLY 11 weeks after the worst terrorist attack in history, New York is discovering just how much the rest of the United States cares about the nation's business and financial center.
 Not much. 
 Early hopes that the nation would rally to help the city overcome the devastating economic impact of Sept. 11 appear to have been misplaced. Not only is Gov. George E. Pataki's ill-advised pitch for $54 billion in federal aid all but dead, apparently the city will struggle to get the $20 billion that President Bush promised. 
Yes, many of the city's economic problems are self-inflicted. With a municipal work force of 250,000, New York employs one-seventh as many people as the federal government, excluding the armed forces. To support that bureaucracy, the city has the highest taxes of any local government in America. Development is absurdly difficult, even outside Manhattan. Roads and bridges are a mess.
But all of that was true before Sept. 11, and New York somehow made do. In fact, a record number of new jobs were created here in 2000, according to Steven Malanga, senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute, a conservative policy group. "In the last seven or eight years, the city's economy has rebounded in a way that's very encouraging," he said.
The attacks changed all that. By discouraging people from coming to crowded places like Times Square, terrorism strikes at the heart of New York, said Mitchell Moss, director of the Taub Urban Research Center at New York University. "New York's economy is built on interaction," he said. The industries that have suffered most severely are New York's most important employers: tourism, media, advertising and financial services, which was due for cuts even before the attacks.
Last month, the city lost 79,000 jobs, a record. The slowdown has blown a hole in city and state budgets, which are precariously balanced at the best of times. The Citizens Budget Commission, a nonpartisan fiscal watchdog organization, predicts that the city will face a budget deficit of $4 billion next year.
Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani has asked city agencies to cut their budgets by 15 percent. More cuts are coming. Libraries will close earlier. Parks will be dirtier. And city workers, who had been asking for big raises, will have to accept layoffs or pay cuts.
Even so, the city cannot get out of this hole alone. With taxes already too high, it cannot reach much deeper into its citizens' pockets. And there are limits to how much it can cut services. A little federal help would go a long way toward righting the city's budget gap and restoring confidence in New York.
Mr. Moss suggests the federal government take two steps to show its commitment to the city. First, it should help create a hub in Lower Manhattan that would connect transit lines from New Jersey and Long Island with the subway. Second, it should support "security zones" where high-profile securities firms and media companies could congregate if they wished.
For now, at least, it appears that Washington will let New York sink or swim on its own. That decision is foolish for both economic and symbolic reasons.
If New York cannot right itself, the securities firms that are among its most important employers are as likely to move jobs to London or Hong Kong as Chicago or Atlanta. And if New York's streets grow dirty and its crime rate soars, other countries may question Washington's promises of aid to those that try to deter terrorism. Will a government that does not bother to aid its largest city in the wake of the worst terror attack in history really do much for Islamabad or Cairo?
"What do we have a federal government for if it's not to give aid to state and local governments, at the level people live and get most of their government services?" asks James A. Parrot, an economist at the Fiscal Policy Institute, a labor-backed research organization.
It is worse than unseemly that lawmakers are offering to pass a tax bill that will give billions of dollars to companies like Enron and I.B.M. while refusing to send New York money that that city has already been promised. It is (whisper this word) unpatriotic.

An Alternate Reality

BYLINE:  By PAUL KRUGMAN 

 BODY:
Most Americans get their news from TV. And what they see is heartwarming -- a picture of a nation behaving well in a time of crisis. Indeed, the vast majority of Americans have been both resolute and generous.
 But that's not the whole story, and the images TV doesn't show are anything but heartwarming. A full picture would show politicians and businessmen behaving badly, with this bad behavior made possible -- and made worse -- by the fact that these days selfishness comes tightly wrapped in the flag. If you pay attention to the whole picture, you start to feel that you are living in a different reality from the one on TV. 
 The alternate reality isn't deeply hidden. It's available to anyone with a modem, and some of it makes it into quality newspapers. Often you can find the best reporting on what's really going on in the business section, because business reporters and commentators are not expected to view the world through rose-colored glasses. 
From an economist's point of view, the most revealing indicator of what's really happening is the post-Sept. 11 fondness of politicians for "lump-sum transfers." That's economese for payments that aren't contingent on the recipient's actions, and which therefore give no incentive for changed behavior. That's good if the transfer is meant to help someone in need, without reducing his motivation to work. It's bad if the alleged purpose of the transfer is to get the recipient to do something useful, like invest or hire more workers. 
So it tells you something when Congress votes $15 billion in aid and loan guarantees for airline companies but not a penny for laid-off airline workers. It tells you even more when the House passes a "stimulus" bill that contains almost nothing for the unemployed but includes $25 billion in retroactive corporate tax cuts -- that is, pure lump-sum transfers to corporations, most of them highly profitable. 
Most political reporting about the stimulus debate describes it as a conflict of ideologies. But ideology has nothing to do with it. No economic doctrine I'm aware of, right or left, says that an $800 million lump-sum transfer to General Motors will lead to more investment when the company is already sitting on $8 billion in cash.
As Jonathan Chait points out, there used to be some question about the true motives of people like Dick Armey and Tom DeLay. Did they really believe in free markets, or did they just want to take from the poor and give to the rich? Now we know.
Of course, it's not all about lump-sum transfers. Since Sept. 11 there has also been a sustained effort, under cover of the national emergency, to open public lands to oil companies and logging interests. Administration officials claim that it's all for the sake of national security, but when you discover that they also intend to reverse rules excluding snowmobiles from Yellowstone, the truth becomes clear.
So what's the real state of the nation? On TV this looks like World War II. But though our cause is just, for 99.9 percent of Americans this war, waged by a small cadre of highly trained professionals, is a spectator event. And the home front looks not like wartime but like a postwar aftermath, in which the normal instincts of a nation at war -- to rally round the flag and place trust in our leaders -- are all too easily exploited. 
Indeed, current events bear an almost eerie resemblance to the period just after World War I. John Ashcroft is re-enacting the Palmer raids, which swept up thousands of immigrants suspected of radicalism; the vast majority turned out to be innocent of any wrongdoing, and some turned out to be U.S. citizens. Executives at Enron seem to have been channeling the spirit of Charles Ponzi. And the push to open public lands to private exploitation sounds like Teapot Dome, which also involved oil drilling on public land. Presumably this time there have been no outright bribes, but the giveaways to corporations are actually much larger. 
What this country needs is a return to normalcy. And I don't mean the selective normalcy the Bush administration wants, in which everyone goes shopping but the media continue to report only inspiring stories and war news. It's time to give the American people the whole picture.

How To Put a Nation Back Together Again

BYLINE:  By BARBARA CROSSETTE 

 BODY:
THE assignment is Afghanistan. But even after a decade or more of rescuing imploded countries, the United Nations and its members have never faced anything like this. A quarter century of war and repression in the name of Islam has left Afghanistan less a country than a drought-stricken shambles of a battlefield with up to a fifth of its 27 million people huddled in refugee tents or makeshift hovels with scant food and no medicine. And, yet again, they are at the mercy of narrow-minded warlords.
 The Bush administration, which once scorned "nation building," now pins its hopes on the United Nations to rebuild Afghanistan. A planning meeting is scheduled in Bonn this week. Fortunately -- after a decade of trial and error in Cambodia, the Balkans, Somalia, Haiti and East Timor -- there is a corps of experts and a formidable body of expertise to draw on this time. 
 Many lessons have been learned, often painfully, about what works or does not. Somalia was a disaster. Ethnic cleansing raged in Bosnia until NATO stepped in, and Rwanda endured genocide. Haiti seemed to defy most good efforts. More successful have been recent moves into Kosovo and into East Timor, where a United Nations administration is building new political, judicial and economic institutions. Meanwhile, an instinctively undemocratic government in Cambodia finds it can't quite rid itself of the rule of law, which a United Nations mission introduced, nor silence dissenters who have gathered strength under international tutelage.
Officials who have played a role as the United Nations has tried to untangle the ruins of failed states have refined similar lists of rules to go by. In conversations, they suggested a few cardinal principles:

1. Neither the U.N. nor any one country can perform miracles; a new way of living, however humane, should not be forced on people who don't want it.
"The world has learned a degree of humility in the last decade," said David Malone, a Canadian diplomat who is president of the International Peace Academy, a United Nations agency that tracks conflict resolution. "Ideal social engineering projects devised in the United Nations Security Council or in regional organizations cannot be imposed on populations."
"This was particularly true in Somalia," he said. The United Nations' vision of a state strong enough to displace clan rule "was simply not shared, and ultimately was resisted by the Somalis with incredible loss of life -- and loss of heart by the international community, leading to our abdication of responsibility in Rwanda."
Mr. Malone sees warning signs in Afghanistan -- "a fractious and fractured country beset by warlordism, where war in many ways is sport as well as livelihood to many of the men. To wean them from the only life they know is going to be extremely difficult." What the United Nations does well, he added, "is peace-building in the right conditions when the parties are actually interested in stability and economic growth, which are taken for granted by us. But they are not taken for granted in many parts of the world where clan honor, ethnic survival or religion may be more important."

2. Don't wait for the peacekeepers. Or count on blue helmets to restore order.
Faster-moving armies are necessary. The Australians in East Timor, the Nigerians in Sierra Leone, NATO in Bosnia and Kosovo, all conducted operations led (with or without United Nations blessing) by national armies, and their quick action made a difference.
Nancy Soderberg, a member of President Bill Clinton's National Security Council who later represented Washington at the United Nations Security Council, saidthe debacle in Somalia, where warlords had reduced the country to violent fiefs, occurred because the international presence was weak and miscast. "The U.N. didn't have an international force occupying Somalia to keep the peace," she said. "Our troops were there to provide humanitarian assistance." When that proved impossible, the mission collapsed and Americans died.
Ms. Soderberg is now vice president of the International Crisis Group, an organization that issues rapid-fire reports on areas of unrest and conflict. In Bosnia, she said, the troops sent by the Security Council were inadequate to handle the murderous rivalries. "In the early days of Bosnia, you had a bunch of U.N. guys who weren't there to fight a war and it was disastrous -- U.N. people chained to lampposts watching ethnic cleansing going on," she said.
The key to peace and reconstruction in Afghanistan will be the quick introduction of an outside force to provide enough safety for work to begin, she said. 
"It's entirely possible that the Afghans will reject an outside force," Ms. Soderberg said. "If you can't get an international force in there, then the U.N.'s ability to help the Afghans would be severely hampered."

3. Set the table for talks and leave the room.
Richard Goldstone, the South African judge who was the first prosecutor for United Nations tribunals on war crimes in the Balkans and Rwanda, said South Africa's transition to majority rule and the hunt for Balkan war criminals taught him that "clearly the first priority -- not always attainable -- is getting local people talking to each other, preferably on their own."
"The key to South Africa's success," he said, "was that negotiations were handled by South Africans themselves but with crucial input, support and encouragement from the international community." In the Balkans he sees still-unfinished business. He said he has seen people there "consumed by their own history, a very selective history." The sense of victimization still runs high and could be addressed by a truth commission like those in South Africa and Central America.

4. Make the talks all-inclusive.
Sir Brian Urquhart, a former under secretary general of the United Nations who worked on early peacekeeping missions in the Congo and the Middle East, said that excluding anyone associated with the Taliban from the meetings in Bonn is a mistake reminiscent of early Mideast policy errors involving the Palestine Liberation Organization. The Taliban, after all, spring from the country's largest ethnic group, the Pashtuns. "You can't have a Middle East peace conference without the P.L.O.," he said. "But that's what we tried to do for 40 years and got into a hell of a mess. It's an old, old story: we don't deal with somebody for supposedly moral reasons, and then we get something infinitely worse. We wouldn't deal with the P.L.O., and now we've got Hamas and Islamic Jihad. Some element of the Taliban should be there in these talks. They were the previous government, after all."
Representatives of Mohammed Zahir Shah, the last Afghan king, will be present, although he has not been in the country since his overthrow in 1973. The Taliban are out because the Northern Alliance, fighting in support of the United States, refuses to entertain their presence. Pakistan, which once supported the Taliban, still argues that the Northern Alliance, which wrecked Afghanistan by infighting and looting after the Soviet Union withdrew and its puppet Afghan government collapsed, should not dictate the country's future. But Pakistan lost this round.

5. Whatever the lessons, they will mean little unless applied by leaders with skill, creativity and wisdom.
The people in any nation being built need to trust the builders. Mr. Goldstone said his own country, South Africa, was fortunate to have had its own political and judicial leadership and institutions that people could trust at a critical moment. For Afghanistan, Secretary General Kofi Annan has chosen two talented and experienced international troubleshooters, Lakhdar Brahimi of Algeria and Francesc Vendrell of Spain. The Bush administration has also sent in pros: Richard N. Haass, the State Department's policy planner, and James F. Dobbins, a career foreign service officer with experience in Haiti and the Balkans.
But there have to be local counterparts, and in Afghanistan, Mr. Goldstone warned, towering symbols of wisdom and strong institutions have been noticeably absent.

Most Parties Will Go On, Even If They're Quieter

BYLINE:  By Vivian Marino 

 BODY:
Still reeling from the terrorist attacks and from the weak economy, which has squeezed profits and produced layoffs, corporate America may hardly be in the mood for merriment. Yet many companies plan to hold some type of holiday celebration, though maybe on a less lavish scale, two surveys show. 
 Eighty-three percent of the 150 large companies surveyed recently by Battalia Winston International, an executive search firm based in New York, say they will have traditional parties or other festivities, down from 92 percent last year. Among those having parties, 41 percent plan to spend less this year, compared with only 3 percent last year. And 73 percent said they would not be giving holiday gifts, versus 60 percent in 2000. The results were released this month. 
 In a survey by HRnext, a human resources consultant in Old Saybrook, Conn., about half the 227 executives responding to its online poll last month said their holiday parties would be "same as always." Thirty percent said they would be holding scaled-down events, while 2 percent indicated that their parties would be "more somber and/ or patriotic." The remaining 19 percent were not having parties.

HEADLINE: More Budget Games in Nassau County 

 BODY:
All the suburban counties around New York City are facing tough times, with falling revenues and a slowing economy. Only one still shies from making the hard choices needed to deal with its problems. In Nassau County, incumbent officials remain locked in the same old avoidance games that plunged this wealthy county into its ongoing fiscal crisis. 
 The oversight board monitoring the county's finances rejected as unbalanced the four-year budget plan submitted in September by Thomas Gulotta, the lame-duck Republican county executive. Earlier this month, it also rejected the one-year budget plan from the County Legislature, finding it still left a gap of more than $33 million. The board has given the county a new deadline of Nov. 28 to come up with a plausible 2002 budget or risk a takeover of the county's finances. 
 Nassau's Democratic county executive-elect, Thomas Suozzi, was on the right track when he privately suggested that the Legislature cover the anticipated deficit by consolidating the 5 percent property tax increases planned for each of the next three years into one year. Republican opposition to any further tax increases cannot be justified in light of the big mandate just given to Mr. Suozzi by voters to clean up Nassau County's mess. 
Mr. Suozzi needs the impasse over next year's budget resolved promptly. When he takes office in January, he must be able to focus on implementing the major reorganization of Nassau's patronage-bloated government that he promised during his campaign, presumably sparing county residents another tax increase in the 2003 budget. 
Time is running short. For the Nov. 28 budget deadline to be met, two things need to happen. Democrats in the Nassau Legislature must muster the courage to pass a budget that includes a sizable property tax increase and Mr. Gulotta, whose reckless budgeting brought Nassau to the edge of bankruptcy, must become convinced that signing such a budget will help the county, and his own sagging reputation as he prepares to exit government.

HEADLINE: Liberties; 
Uncivil Liberties?

BYLINE:  By MAUREEN DOWD 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
A friend of mine, a liberal editor at a magazine, has been trying to get some of his staffers interested in writing about whether the Bush team's anti-terrorism measures are scorching our civil liberties.
 It's the sort of topic they'd usually jump at. But not this time. 
 "As good liberals, we feel we ought to be upset but somehow we're not," my friend mused. "But why not? In part because we were really attacked this time. Before, when the president talked about national security, it was in the abstract. Now, you say, 'Oh, this is national security.' 
"We're all in this haze of indifference. I don't want to get into it enough to have to make a decision about how bad it is. What if I reached the conclusion that this is all terrible? Would I have to start protesting in the streets? I'm not in the mood for a big civil libertarian crisis."
With supreme ambivalence, we are embarking on the Ashcroft era in American justice. The Economist writes that the attorney general's assault on evil has "a Cromwellian feel," noting dryly: "England's Lord Protector also disapproved of drinking, dancing and smoking."
The evangelical barbershop singer, whose nomination was opposed by every liberal special interest, has now become the big man in town.
It's weird what tricks fate plays. The great hope of the Christian right who was toppled by a dead man and his widow has re-emerged as a colossus bestriding the country.
A true sectarian in religion and politics, who said at Bob Jones University that in America "we have no king but Jesus," will leave a huge mark on the way Americans live their lives.
Mr. Ashcroft's contentious nomination fight was not over whether he had a fine legal mind. Senators fought over whether or not he was too riddled by prejudice and narrowness to serve, as they examined his opposition to a black judicial nominee, a gay ambassadorial nominee, abortion rights and his odd defense of slaveowners and Confederate generals.
Now, stunned by terrorists, abroad and in our midst, the country is seized by contradictory impulses.
On the one hand, we have to trust Mr. Ashcroft. Four thousand people are dead. We are at war with anthrax. There is no question that the attorney general inherited a Justice Department and an F.B.I. that were grossly delinquent on domestic security. The terrorists had been planning the encore attack in New York for at least two years. The F.B.I. has revealed that all 19 hijackers came in legally, and only three of their visas had expired. How does that happen?
But even as we cut the guy some slack, we have to be really skeptical about his assertions of power. It was telling that the first resistance to his edict to interview 5,000 Middle Eastern men came from police chiefs objecting to racial profiling. We're trying to trust someone whose instincts once did not inspire universal trust to rethink the way civil liberties will be treated for a generation.
In the middle of our terrorism war, Mr. Ashcroft did, after all, find time to meddle with the right of the terminally ill in Oregon to take advantage of the state's assisted suicide law. 
The A.G. started his job in a polarized capital. A Newsweek cover declared that his ascent had started a new Holy War here, a culture clash between liberals and conservatives.
Before they were startled by a real demon, left-wing groups had planned to demonize Mr. Ashcroft as the Teddy and Hillary of the right, a fund-raising hot-button character.
But now Nadine Strossen, president of the A.C.L.U., is careful to say she does not think the president and attorney general are infringing on civil liberties in a "cynical, 'we'll take advantage of this to multiply our powers' " sort of way. But, she says, we still must be on guard when the Bushies simply ask us to trust them.
"People are very concerned, at least in the abstract," she said. "They say they are willing to give up their freedoms for national security if they are getting something in return. But they are not sure they are getting something in return."
Since Sept. 11, the attorney general has discovered that liberals are not a monolith, that one can believe in the A.C.L.U. and national security, that one can want privacy protected and still be a patriot. 
If we have to complicate our view of John Ashcroft, then John Ashcroft has to complicate his view of us.

HEADLINE: The Health Care Spark 

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re "Health Care as Main Engine: Is That So Bad?" (Nov. 11), which described how health-related industries would be sources of growth in an otherwise reeling economy: 
 The article cites a "gap between Americans who can afford the world's best health care and the 40 million others who have no insurance to help them pay their bills." 
That is hardly the extent of it. People in most employers' health plans are being asked to pay more and more of their costs. Since their insurance now covers too little, most middle-class working people risk personal bankruptcy if they become seriously ill. The "gap" is thus between the wealthiest few and everybody else.
Our nation spends more on health, both as a share of G.D.P. and per capita, than many countries that provide high-quality, affordable care to every resident. It's time to use some good old American know-how to figure out how we can do the same.

To the Editor:
 The article overlooked the highly decentralized, free-market nature of our nation's health care industry. 
This contrasts with centralized, government-run health care systems of many industrialized nations. 
 America's health care system comprises thousands of companies. This highly competitive, entrepreneurial environment places a premium on innovation. As a result, most high-tech innovations in health care, from the artificial heart to advanced disease management software programs, were developed by entrepreneurial American companies. This gives our nation and its work force an invaluable advantage in competing in a knowledge-driven global economy.

HEADLINE: Bartlesville Journal; 
Oil Company Town Has a Sudden Identity Crisis

BYLINE:  By JIM YARDLEY 

DATELINE: BARTLESVILLE, Okla., Nov. 23 

 BODY:
The phrase "significant presence" -- tends to stick in the throat like a diagnosis from a doctor. Except that the people in this small Oklahoma town who are bracing for the unexpected loss of the Phillips Petroleum Company after more than eight decades still do not know if it means life or death.
 "Well, it's bittersweet," said Donna Copeland, a self-proclaimed "Phillips brat," after hearing this week's surprise announcement that Phillips plans to merge with Conoco Inc. to create the world's sixth-largest oil and gas company. "I think it will be better for the company, but I don't think it will be better for Bartlesville." 
 Until now, what was good for Phillips was always good for Bartlesville, and vice versa. But if the merger is approved, as expected, the new company, ConocoPhillips, would have headquarters in Houston while maintaining, in the words of company officials, a "significant presence" in Bartlesville. No one doubts that this means job cuts are coming, a point confirmed by officials. The question is how many, and when, and whom.
And so the celebrations at Thanksgiving tables have been muted in this town of 35,000 people where about 2,400 work for Phillips and where nearly every other business has benefited from the presence of the petroleum giant. 
"We all had a talk, and we all just shook our heads and said this is sad," said Ms. Copeland, 48, whose father and father-in-law worked for Phillips.
Ms. Copeland and her husband run an appliance store across from the Phillips headquarters on a street named for the company's founder, Frank Phillips. She recalled a childhood in which Phillips Petroleum was essentially a member of her family.
"The cars always had Phillips tires," Ms. Copeland said. "You didn't go on a vacation and not buy Phillips gas. Anything Phillips made, we bought, and that was pretty common. That's what people thought was the right thing to do."
Founded in 1917 by Mr. Phillips, who had started out as an Iowa barber, the company expanded beyond oil drilling to refining and then to retail sales with the Phillips 66 service stations. In turn, Bartlesville benefited from Phillips's success; today, the town has museums, a civic ballet association, a symphony, a downtown concert hall and an annual Mozart festival. Another landmark of the town -- a 19-story skyscraper designed by Frank Lloyd Wright and completed in 1956 -- is the legacy of another hometown oil tycoon, H. C. Price.
Pam Dunlap, president of the Bartlesville Area Chamber of Commerce, said the town had gained immeasurably from Phillips. This year, the United Way has established a fund-raising goal of $900,000. So far, Ms. Dunlap said, 115 Phillips employees are "pacesetters," donating a total of $155,000. Company executives populate the boards of local charities, civic associations and churches.
But Bartlesville has also stood steadfastly behind Phillips. When the corporate raider T. Boone Pickens, and later Carl Icahn, tried hostile takeovers of the company, townsfolk rallied. There were rallies, and T-shirts were printed with a picture of Mr. Pickens stamped with a circle and a line through it. 
"The town really stood up and helped us," said a Phillips spokeswoman, Kristi DesJarlais. The company fought off the takeovers but took on huge debt that would force a steady downsizing after oil prices collapsed in the mid-1980's. In 1981, Phillips employed a high of 9,100 people in Bartlesville, a number that had dropped to 3,200 by 1995 before falling to the current 2,400.
In fact, some residents say the reductions at Phillips in the past 15 years have taken some of the edge off the merger announcement. "If you had called me 10 years ago," said Barbara Hopper, 44, a local real estate broker, "it would have been panic city. People were running scared. Now, you're seeing some people say, 'Whatever is going to happen, let it happen.' "
From a business standpoint, analysts say the merger makes sense and should help Phillips and Conoco fend off any takeover attempts at a time when low oil prices have lowered both their stock prices. Long-time residents in nearby Ponca City still recall when the homegrown Conoco uprooted nearly five decades ago. Conoco still has a refinery in Ponca City, which is as much a company town as Bartlesville.
"It's going to put a whole new perspective on the Ponca City-Bartlesville football game next year," said Mayor Tom Leonard of Ponca City. "It's a little unusual to think it's now the same company. We've been friendly rivals for years and years."
The challenge before Bartlesville officials is familiar to countless small towns that have lost textile mills or other huge manufacturers after an era of downsizing. Ms. Dunlap, the chamber president, said a task force had been formed to begin plotting the town's future and how to attract companies that will bring new jobs. But she agrees that a more intangible challenge in the future will be grappling with the civic self-esteem of a small town that is no longer home to a big company.
"We've identified ourselves as the headquarters town of Phillips," Ms. Dunlap said. "If we are no longer that town, then who are we? How do we identify ourselves now?"

HEADLINE: Australia Wants More People, but Without More Immigration 

BYLINE:  By JOHN SHAW 

DATELINE: SYDNEY, Australia, Nov. 24 

 BODY:
Australians recently made it clear in a national election that they want to limit immigration, but they also recognize that they need more people for their country.
 Australia, as large as the United States, minus Alaska, has only 19.3 million people. The United States has more than 280 million. 
 Many experts, lobbyists and opinion makers in business, politics, research centers and the news media here are advocating more inviting policies and programs for both migration and parenthood to counter a long decline in the national birthrate, and to avoid the demographic black hole of zero population growth.
As in similar debates elsewhere about falling fertility rates, which reduce the labor supply and result in a greater ratio of retirees to working-age adults, the demographic issues in Australia result from slow change and do not lend themselves well to quick action.
But Australia is not alone in facing this problem. Such themes are also emerging on the political and economic agendas of developed nations elsewhere, particularly in Western Europe and Japan.
In the Nov. 10 election here, in which governing conservatives won a third three-year term, the government and the rival union-backed Labor Party agreed on forcibly rejecting about 2,000 asylum seekers -- refugees escaping conflicts and poverty in the Middle East and other parts of Asia -- who had been ferried into Australian waters by smugglers. 
Both political parties want to offer tax breaks to new mothers, but neither side offered voters a coherent immigration or population policy.
The scope for demographic debate here remains wide, with some ecologists saying that by 2050 the population should be cut in half to preserve the environment, while some developers and strategists want to double it by midcentury for defense and economic reasons.
Those taking the middle ground project growth to about 25 million over 30 years, and say that achieving even that modest expansion requires significant policy reforms intended to recruit skilled migrants and to maintain or lift birthrates.
Australia's immigration minister, Philip Ruddock, is seeking to bring in 85,000 settlers next year, half of them English-speaking skilled workers, a difficult goal. "We have to compete with increasing global demand for skilled migrants," he said.
Australia also faces a "brain drain" of its own educated young people, with about 6 percent of its college graduates leaving this year, mainly lured by jobs overseas.
"Australia is becoming a small player in the international migration market," said Peter McDonald, a professor of demography at the Australian National University. "It is not easy to recruit." He cited the European Union's recent moves to coordinate immigration among its 15 member nations.
The latest United Nations Population Fund report forecasts that if present trends continue, the population of Europe, now 726.3 million, will be 603.3 million by 2050. Japan's population, now 127.3 million, is expected to drop to 109.2 million.
Fertility is falling across the developed world. Australia's 1.7 births per woman is above Spain's 1.2 and Italy's 1.4, but well below the "replacement rate" of 2.1, last reached here in 1975. The rate in the United States is 2.06. 
Dr. McDonald said it was likely that the birthrate would fall to the current Canadian level of 1.65.

HEADLINE: Big Issues, Petty Debate in Taiwan 

BYLINE:  By MARK LANDLER 

DATELINE: TAIPEI, Taiwan, Nov. 23 

 BODY:
By any conventional political yardstick, President Chen Shui-bian ought to be in deep trouble.
 Little has gone right since Mr. Chen was elected president in March 2000, shooing out the Nationalist Party after its 55 years of rule. Taiwan's economy is on life support, relations with China are paralyzed and Mr. Chen has been throttled by a Legislature still dominated by the Nationalists. 
 Yet as voters here prepare for a legislative election on Saturday, Mr. Chen's allies say the opposition is in such disarray that he may actually emerge in a marginally stronger position. His Democratic Progressive Party hopes to capture 20 additional seats, which would give it 85 of the 225 seats in the Legislature, and put it within striking distance of the Nationalists.
"This election will redraw Taiwan's political map," said Shen Fu-hsiung, a Democratic Progressive lawmaker from Taipei.
Dr. Shen seems unenthusiastic about the prediction, though. Partly it is because he knows that elections here are fluid, with last-minute swings that can make accurate handicapping difficult. Beyond that, he is discouraged by the tone of this campaign, which has been mean-spirited and picayune.
Politics in Taiwan is a contact sport, but the nastiness this time around has upset people. They say the squabbling over petty issues has blocked a badly needed debate over Taiwan's economic future.
"When you're sailing through a storm, the two parties should sit in the middle of the boat, rather than arguing over who sits in the bow and who sits in the stern," Dr. Shen said, shaking his head.
It is a sorry contrast to the 2000 campaign, which, while bitter at times, ushered in the island's first peaceful transfer of power. Twenty months later, that plucky exercise in democracy has faded in the face of an ascendant China. 
Taiwan's problems, and the apparent unwillingness of politicians to address them, have drawn some unorthodox candidates into the race. David Chou, a former toymaker, is running on a platform advocating that Taiwan should petition Washington to be admitted as the 51st state of the United States.
Mr. Chou, 52, has been peddling this idea since 1994 to a mostly bemused audience. But he contends that Taiwan's economic deterioration, coupled with China's rise, has given his proposal new credibility.
"Taiwan is so weak that we cannot survive without U.S. protection," said Mr. Chou, who went to school in the United States. "If we don't solve this problem in our generation, the next generation will be in big trouble."
A more serious candidacy is that of Sisy Chen, one of Taiwan's best-known television commentators. Ms. Chen, 43, said she hoped to raise the level of the debate in the Legislature. With her keen intellect and flashy image -- she wears rhinestone-studded jeans and dresses her aides in fairy-tale costumes -- she has at least added color to the otherwise pallid proceedings.
A member of the opposition party for two decades, Ms. Chen quit in 1998 out of disgust at its bias toward native Taiwanese. She said ethnic prejudices were once again driving politics here.
Ms. Chen puts the blame squarely on Lee Teng-hui, a former president who emerged from retirement in June to break with his old comrades in the Nationalist Party and to form a stridently pro-Taiwan party. The Nationalists are supported largely by people born on the mainland who fled to Taiwan after 1949.
"Lee has completely changed the terms of the debate to Taiwanese versus mainlanders," Ms. Chen said.
Mr. Lee's party is likely to pick up only a few seats, but the former president has been a volatile presence. He has ridiculed the Nationalists as handmaidens of Beijing, which prompted the party to expel him. Analysts say he has also goaded Mr. Chen to pump up his anti-China statements.
"Ethnic politics is a cheap shot, and you can always use it to distract people from real-world issues," said Chu Yuan-han, a professor of political science at National Taiwan University.
Taiwan has no shortage of real-world issues. The island is in its deepest recession on record, drained by the slump in demand for its technology exports. Unemployment rose above 5 percent in October, a traumatic level for a place used to years of torrid growth.
Adding to the sense of decline, Taiwan's computer industry is relocating en masse to China, where labor is cheap and abundant. With China and Taiwan soon to be members of the World Trade Organization, farmers and others here fear a flood of cheap goods from across the Taiwan Strait.
For a place that built a technology industry from scratch in two decades, the lack of fresh ideas about Taiwan's future is striking. Under pressure from businesses, Mr. Chen lifted restrictions on investments in China. But that seemed less a bold stroke than a recognition of reality.
"By giving up its competitiveness, Taiwan will lose its last bargaining chip vis-a-vis China," Sisy Chen said.
That matters little for now, since relations between the two are in a deep freeze. China regards Taiwan as a breakaway province; it distrusts Mr. Chen because his party supports independence. His recent remarks -- in which he distanced himself from the concept of a single China -- have not helped.
Political analysts say Beijing will keep rebuffing Mr. Chen unless his party gains a majority. Because that prospect is unlikely, even with an improved showing, the chill in relations may persist until the next election in 2004.
If Mr. Chen faces an uncertain future, he can take comfort from the fact that his opponents are on even shakier ground. Still reeling from their defeat last year, the Nationalists are resigned to losing seats in the Legislature. Their hope is to cling to a margin of about 10 seats over Mr. Chen's party.
For some analysts here, the chaos in Taiwanese politics is neither unusual nor hard to explain. As in two other young Asian democracies, Indonesia and the Philippines, disorder is a natural result of the abrupt shift in power from a long-ruling government to an untested opposition.
"We have a ruling party that cannot rule and an opposition party that does not know how to effectively oppose the government," Ms. Chen said. "That is the tragedy of Taiwanese democracy."

HEADLINE: The World's Economies Slide Together Into Recession 

BYLINE:  By JOSEPH KAHN 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 22 

 BODY:
With American economic malaise spreading as seamlessly as the technology-driven surge that preceded it, many economists now agree that the world is suffering its first recession in two decades and that recovery may come more slowly than once expected.
 The common slump may be revealing a dark side to the increasing economic integration of the last decade. The gyrations in cross-border trade and investment -- even in business and consumer confidence -- show that nations are responding in like fashion in times of trouble, just as they responded in the same way to the boom years of the late 1990's. 
 By almost all estimates, the world has entered a recession, meaning that growth this year will fall below the 2.5 percent annual rate that the International Monetary Fund defines as the breaking point between economic progress and slippage.
While the vast majority of economic activity still takes place within national borders, the world has become a more cohesive place in recent years. European reinsurance companies, which provide insurance to insurers, suffered heavily from the Sept. 11 attacks in New York, for example. The German conglomerate DaimlerChrysler is at least as sensitive to swings in auto sales in the American market as those at home. Taiwanese semiconductor makers shed jobs the moment computer sales decline in the United States. 
The United States economy has shown tentative signs of stabilizing, as the number of people filing for unemployment insurance declined for the fourth straight week and consumer confidence inched ahead. But weakness among America's major trading partners could help delay a full recovery until the middle of next year, some economists say.
East Asian economies are shrinking in the second half of this year, led by Japan's deepening economic crisis. Mexico and Canada followed the United States into recession, and their woes have spread to Argentina and Brazil. Some economists say Germany's worsening performance -- its economy slipped into reverse in the third quarter, the latest statistics show -- could drag most of Europe into negative territory.
"One by one, every major country is tipping into a rare and possibly lethal recession," said Stephen Roach, chief global economist at Morgan Stanley in New York, who has been predicting a worldwide slump since early in the year. "It is far-reaching and deep, and much of that has to do with the fact that we've become much more interconnected."
If the trend holds, the United States, Japan and Europe -- considered the three main engines of growth -- are likely to see their first collective contraction since the oil price shock of the mid-1970's. Many forecasters now say they see problems continuing until the second half of 2002, then a relatively modest rebound.
Global trade increased rapidly throughout the 1990's, as multinational companies shipped products through a global supply chain that minimized costs and maximized efficiency with little regard for national borders. Trade accounted for about 17 percent of economic activity 20 years ago compared with about 26 percent today, according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, the Paris-based organization of the world's most developed countries. 
But while cross-border commerce grew by nearly 13 percent in 2000, a record increase, it has declined so far this year, the first such drop since the deep recession of the early 1980's. Trade has gone from fueling global prosperity to detracting from growth everywhere.
"It's clear that the global trade has become an extremely powerful transmission channel" for economic trends, said Val Koromzay, director of country studies for the O.E.C.D. "We are only beginning to understand the degree to which economies have become synchronized."
The behavior of multinational companies may offer some answers. Large corporations tend to coordinate their operations, however far-flung, based on the company's overall financial health. 
Executives say that companies often react to a change in fortunes in a leading market -- say, the United States -- by cutting investment and employment in Germany and Hong Kong, often ignoring differences in economic performance in the three places.
The statistics back up the idea that companies are quick to react globally. Led by a steep decline in capital flows to emerging markets, businesses appear to be cutting investments abroad faster than at home.
They have also become far less eager to buy one another. Mergers and acquisitions around the world are off 55 percent so far this year compared with 2000, according to Morgan Stanley. That is a sharp contrast to the milder recession of the early 1990's, when Japanese companies were still expanding rapidly in the United States, Europe and Southeast Asia.
Partly because no major economy has managed to stay vibrant, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development reported this week that its 30 member nations would probably experience reduced output in the second half of this year. It also reduced its growth forecast for next year by two-thirds, to 1 percent from almost 3 percent .
The worldwide downturn gives some ammunition to critics of global integration, many of whom have argued that the trend toward corporate expansion and unfettered flow of goods and money will not foster sustained prosperity.
Nations that enthusiastically courted foreign multinational investment and followed American advice to keep their markets open and their currencies freely convertible have suffered most. Singapore, Taiwan, Mexico and Argentina are among the nations that were considered economic models in the late 1990's that are now experiencing deep recessions.
China, Russia and India have tended to move more slowly toward integrating themselves into the global economy, and they have suffered much less in recent months.
On the other hand, the fact that a decline in trade and investment appears to have had a pronounced drag on global growth suggests that the above-average expansion of the late 1990's had more to do with rapid integration than critics acknowledged at the time.
"There is an underlying trend toward more synchronization" that accounts, at least in part, for today's broad downturn, said Kenneth Rogoff, chief economist of the International Monetary Fund. But he said that the same forces would raise average growth rates over the long haul.
"There's no question that we would be worse off without it," Mr. Rogoff said.
While most economists agree that that nations should integrate more, many say the risks are also becoming clearer. Investors who bought surging Internet stocks a few years ago thought they had the potential to earn extraordinary returns, but they suffered unusually steep losses. Nations can also follow the herd.
The clearest sign of that is the technology boom, which gripped Finland, Israel, Hong Kong and Chile with the same fervor it excited in the United States. The collapse of the Nasdaq became a common shock -- not unlike the oil shock of the 1970's -- that punished risk-takers everywhere.
Porous borders and open competition have also proven to be a double-edged sword. Prices of the most highly traded goods have been in general decline for several years. That has generally been good news for consumers. But it has left businesses struggling to earn reliable profits on both commodities and manufactured goods.
With the notable exception of oil, which does not respond freely to market forces, prices of commodities like coffee and copper, as well as simple manufactured goods like clothing and shoes, and some highly traded industrial goods like steel, have been slipping steadily. This deflation has already overtaken Japan and other Asian nations. It is lapping the shores of the United States and Europe.
While few expect lasting deflation in this country, the United States has begun to see at least a temporary fall in prices. The American producer price index declined at a 1.6 percent rate last month, its steepest drop in many years. Consumer prices also slipped in October.
Falling prices tend to discourage economic activity because businesses see less likelihood of earning high returns if they have to cut prices. Consumers defer purchases if they think they may be able to buy the same item for less in the future.
Ultimately, economics can be a self-fulfilling prophecy. The world is unlikely to fall into a deflationary spiral unless people believe that will happen. But even psychology can be borderless.
While the Bush administration is worried about how Americans and Arabs are getting divergent information about the war in Afghanistan, economists are more focused on the fact that the vast majority of people around the world get roughly the same take on events. French, Spanish, Thai and Korean people have reacted in much the same way to the attacks of Sept. 11. Air travel and tourism are down everywhere.
Mr. Rogoff said he saw a high correlation between business and consumer sentiment across the world that might sway economic performance even more than other common links, like trade and finance.
"One reason we have become more synchronized," he said, "is because we're all watching CNN."

HEADLINE: The Neediest Cases; 
Children's Long-Term Illnesses Mean a Strain on Families' Resources

BYLINE:  By AARON DONOVAN

 BODY:
A Washington Heights boy hospitalized with lupus a few days shy of his graduation from fifth grade.
 A boy and girl from Brooklyn limited physically by a rare disease that causes a weakening of the heart. 
 An energetic Queens toddler who looks healthy, but is fed through a tube and will need a kidney transplant one day.
Two little boys in a Bronx tenement apartment, with sickle cell anemia so severe that they miss school every month to go to the hospital.
Across the city, children with chronic illnesses fill hospital wards and their parents' names are found throughout the rosters of those who need help from charities. 
Arlene Goldsmith, executive director of New Alternatives for Children, said that parents of chronically ill children face increased rates of divorce and separation, depression and substance abuse. But they also face financial burdens for expenses not covered by Medicaid.
New Alternatives is a nonprofit organization that aids the families of chronically ill children. It is a member of the Federation of Protestant Welfare Agencies, which receives money from The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund. "The money that we have received is extraordinarily significant in the lives of these children and these families," Ms. Goldsmith said. "It's helped not only to improve the quality of life for the disabled child and their family, but has made a difference in the ability of the family to get back on their feet."
Last Sunday afternoon in Chelsea, the Avenue of the Americas near West 17th Street bustled with the activities of leisure in a New York returning to normal. But unknown to anyone on the busy avenue, upstairs at the New York Foundling Hospital, in a gray room with a polished tile floor, were three young children with chronic illnesses. It is where they sleep, where they are treated and tutored and where they entertain themselves during their hospital stay.
Two of the children have cerebral palsy; the other, Christopher Jimenez, has severe lupus. He was looking forward to returning home to Washington Heights for a few days.
Christopher was first hospitalized in June, after his urine turned red with blood. Days before, he had won a basketball tournament in a league run by the Children's Aid Society at Public School 152 in Washington Heights.
Christopher's mother, Jasmine Tolentino, came in and said hello. He jumped up and let her sit in his rocking chair, then promptly sat back down in her lap. "Ay, so pretty," she said, rubbing her son's belly.
His mother's presence reminded Christopher, 12, of his family's crowded apartment. "Sometimes I feel depressed because I'm not at home," Christopher said. "My sisters and my family are with each other and I'm here alone."
At his hospital bedside, Christopher has space enough for a poster of Daunte Culpepper, the Minnesota Vikings quarterback, and some imitation World Wrestling Federation victory belts that he made out of construction paper. But when he returns home in what he hopes will be a few weeks, he'll go back to a room too crowded for posters of his own.
He shares his bedroom with his brother, Alex, 15; his three sisters, Beatrice Mezon, 21, Rubilania, 11, and Jessica, 9; and Ms. Mezon's son, Amorphis Vrito, 3. The six sleep in two bunk beds while Ms. Tolentino, 42, sleeps in the kitchen, the only other room in the apartment.
Ms. Tolentino works at odd jobs cleaning offices or stores around the neighborhood and her family receives $754 a month in welfare and $400 a month in food stamps. "I go to church to get food," she said. "I'm not going to take a chance to not eat."
When a social worker from the Children's Aid Society, Aleida Suarez, came to see Ms. Tolentino's apartment, she found that the children were sleeping on bare mattresses. She immediately bought sheets, pillows and blankets for them. In all, she spent $300 that day. The agency also spent $782 on a dresser and dining table, and about $1,200 for new bunk beds for the children and for a professional cleaning service to go over the apartment. 
The Children's Aid Society is one of the seven local charities supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund. "They were in serious need of furniture and clothing and housing supplies," Ms. Suarez said. "The only way we could have helped them was with Neediest Cases funds."
Things were tough enough for Ms. Tolentino when she had one child in the hospital. But they became worse when she had two.
In October, her other son, Alex, was stabbed on a subway train on his ride home from school. Last week, Alex recalled the terrifying afternoon attack. Six young men started hitting and kicking him, he said. By the time the train doors opened at the next stop, his face was swollen and bloody, and someone had stabbed him in the lower back, not far from his spine.
"If that knife hadn't missed," Alex said, "I could have been paralyzed."
The police arrested three of the attackers, the family said, but that was little consolation for a woman struggling to raise five children without the support of their fathers. "Both my sons were in the hospital," she said, her weary head resting on her pillow in the kitchen as her daughter Rubilania rested in her arms. "It's too many things together."

As they did for Ms. Tolentino, difficulties often come in pairs for the neediest of families. In the Salmoni family of Starrett City, Brooklyn, two of the three children were affected by a disease called cardiomyopathy, which weakens the heart's ability to pump blood. The couple's elder son, Elior, 15, had a heart transplant a year ago that saved his life. Their daughter, Judy, 12, can no longer walk without assistance. 
In January 1998, Elior complained of difficulty walking up the stairs at school. "One day I take him to the doctor in the morning, and in the night they tell me he needs a heart transplant," said Vered Salmoni, Elior's mother, who immigrated from Israel in 1984. 
"They told me, 'Listen, your son is very, very sick,' " Mrs. Salmoni said. Elior returned home, but began vomiting one evening shortly after. 
"They said, 'You have to come back, he has to stay in the hospital,' " Mrs. Salmoni recalled. "He couldn't even go home waiting for the heart."
Fortunately, Elior received a heart transplant in March 1999. After going through so much, Elior said he is not afraid of hospitals. He wants to be a doctor. "I want to cure diseases," he said. "Maybe I could find out that you won't have to take medications after a transplant."
Elior's little sister began to show signs of the heart disease around the same time he did. At first, she complained of general fatigue, but her illness has progressed. She has lost the ability to move her hands higher than shoulder level, and when she tries to walk, she needs someone to help hold her head up.
Most of the time, Judy's tiny body sits slumped to her left in her wheelchair, a result of scoliosis brought on by weakened back muscles. "I can't do most of the stuff that I used to be able to do," she said. "It doesn't hurt, but it's harder for me." She receives physical therapy four days a week and wears a back brace at night.
Lifting her daughter's wheelchair into the car was always a struggle for Mrs. Salmoni, who is 41. One day, the strain caused her to bleed internally. 
To help her, the Metropolitan Council on Jewish Poverty paid for a used 1999 Dodge minivan that her husband, Ofer, bought at an auction for $7,000. With the new minivan, which is equipped with a lift, it is much easier for Mrs. Salmoni to take Judy to school or to appointments, she said. 
"Vered always does all she can for the kids," said Lisa Gribetz, a social worker with the council who works with the family. "She's nurturing, she's caring, she's loving. Unfortunately because of her children's illnesses, she's had to become an expert on their illness. We're really just trying to support her in that role."
Mrs. Salmoni is studying at Toro College to become a certified public accountant. Her husband works part time as a mechanic. The family has no health insurance, but Medicaid pays for much of the children's medical treatments.
The council is a beneficiary agency of UJA-Federation of New York, another charity supported by the Neediest Cases Fund. Though the council used money from other sources for the van, it used $500 from the Neediest Cases Fund to help Judy get treatment to improve her overall muscle strength from a specialized physical therapy clinic in Israel. The only clinic in the United States that could have provided such services would have been more expensive, Mrs. Salmoni said.
The clinic's fees totaled $4,250, and the council sought help from a variety of sources, said Jackie Ebron, director of the council's crisis intervention program. "I tapped into everything that was available," Ms. Ebron said. "When we left that family we left them in a better place than when we found them, and that's what we're here for."
Judy tries to put her illness in perspective. "I'm mad, but I have to go on," she said. "I can't be mad my whole life."
She wants to grow up to be an actress. "I like acting," she said. "It's fun being someone else."

A Need for Special Care
Energetic 2-Year-Old Under Strict Regimen
Unlike Judy Salmoni, Justin Sayroo, 2, has an abundance of energy that simply pours out of him. But he also has malfunctioning -- polycystic -- kidneys, and one day will need either weekly dialysis treatments or a transplant, his mother, Sandra Sayroo, said.
Each day, two home health aides come to the family's home in Ozone Park, Queens, to give Justin his medication and food, adhering to a strict regimen. But Ms. Sayroo and her daughter, Jeneve Ali, 16, have their hands full during the eight hours the aides are not there to help. 
Ms. Sayroo, 39, is a dental assistant in Downtown Brooklyn, earning $9 an hour for the 10 1/2-hour days that she works. The health aides work from 11 p.m. to 3 p.m. each day, but it falls on Jeneve to care for her brother when she comes home from school. "It's too much for her," Ms. Sayroo said. "But if she doesn't do it, there's no other way we could care for him."
Justin's food must be pureed and slowly fed through a tube to his stomach. He receives medication through the tube about every three hours, even at nighttime, when he must be awakened. 
Because treatment for the illness requires that Justin's temperature be well regulated, a social worker for Ms. Sayroo asked the Federation of Protestant Welfare Agencies last June for an air-conditioner. It cost $360 from the Neediest Cases Fund, and helped Justin sleep better. 
Ms. Sayroo, who is divorced from Jeneve's father, had dreamed of moving back to her native Trinidad, but decided to stay in New York when Justin was born in 1999. When he was 2 days old, his lung collapsed and he was placed in intensive care. "He was born sick," she said. "There's no way he could get the treatment he's getting in Trinidad."
Fortunately for Justin, his father, Wayne Mohammed, who lives in Trinidad, has volunteered to come to the United States and donate one of his kidneys as soon as his son is old enough to accept it. 

Struggling With Sickle Cell
Couple Sacrifice Jobs To Care for Two Sons
With money from the Neediest Cases Fund, the Community Service Society was able to help a family that lives on the fourth floor of an aging Bronx tenement, where an unshaded light bulb illuminates a warm kitchen cluttered with baby bottles and cans of formula.
There, one recent day, two pots filled with beef stew and white rice simmered on a stove top. But the boy in the kitchen was not yet hungry for his dinner. He wanted his mother to make him a blue Kool-Aid slushie.
To fix it for him, she needed a free hand, and she asked the boy to take the infant who was in her arms. "Hold your brother," said the boy's mother, Yvonne Mercado-Pena, 35.
The boy, Charlie Pena, 8, began to spin the baby around. "Wheee, wheee," Charlie said.
Mrs. Mercado-Pena looked into her freezer, retrieved some ice and put it into the blender. "My kids are into slushies now," she explained.
By that time, the 8-year-old and the 8-month-old had had all the fun they could, and stopped to watch their mother. 
It was a joy-filled evening for the family. Charlie and his brother Michael, 5, were not at the hospital. Both boys have a severe form of sickle cell anemia, and are hospitalized about once a month.
It is a perplexing disease that leaves their parents constantly concerned. "They could be fine, and 15 minutes later they could be running a fever and you don't know why," Mrs. Mercado-Pena said.
The boys take penicillin and folic acid supplements every day. Every few days they need aspirin for pain and fever. Charlie said he disliked taking the pills but preferred it to going to the hospital, a place he called "Columbus-Presbyterian." (The boys are seen in the pediatric hematology department at the Columbia-Presbyterian Center of New York Presbyterian Hospital in Washington Heights.)
"When I go there, I have some fun," Charlie said, "but I already know that I'm going to get a shot. It feels like getting pinched by a horn from a bull."
Because of their sickle cell anemia, the boys' immune systems are less able to attack and kill foreign bacteria. Their mother has to take special care not to let them get too cold when they go swimming or play in the snow. She fears for the day that she says doctors have told her is inevitable -- when the boys will receive their first blood transfusion. After that, they will have to have transfusions for the rest of their lives.
Like many other parents of seriously ill children, Mrs. Mercado-Pena finds she does not have time to hold down a job -- that is, outside of caring for her children. 
She used to work as an administrative assistant in the public relations department of Salomon Smith Barney. But by 1997, as her two sons required more care and she began coming in late more often, her boss told her that she had to make more of a commitment to the job. "I was put between a rock and a hard place," Mrs. Mercado-Pena recalled. "I told her, 'My kids come first.' "
She was asked to resign, she said. Two days later, Michael was hospitalized for four days with swelling of his joints and the flu, and Mrs. Mercado-Pena knew she had made the only decision she could.
The family still had the salary of her husband, Carlos Pena, a jewelry maker. But in February 2000, Mr. Pena lost his job when the company he worked for moved from Midtown Manhattan to Mineola, on Long Island. He told the company he did not want to be so far away in case his sons had an emergency.
Mr. Pena went on unemployment, but the family did not have enough money to pay the $950 rent on their fourth-floor walk-up apartment. After six months, they owed $5,700 and were being threatened with eviction.
They raised $3,800 from savings and family members, but still needed $1,900 to prevent an eviction. Mrs. Mercado-Pena called the Community Service Society for help, and the agency paid the remaining balance from the Neediest Cases Fund.
Mr. Pena is now employed full time at a small jewelry shop half a block away from the Grand Concourse in the Bronx, four subway stops from the family's apartment.
"They definitely were in a position where our services could be of use to them," said Natasha Baptiste, the social worker from the agency who had applied for the grant to help the family. "I saw a need and a way to fix it."

HEADLINE: Collateral Damage In Lower Manhattan 

BYLINE:  By TERRY PRISTIN 

 BODY:
For many people trying to make a living in Lower Manhattan, the weeks since Sept. 11 have been devastating. Shops were closed or inaccessible, and so no money came in, putting business owners behind in their rent. Once these businesses did reopen, they discovered that their customer base had largely vanished.
 As if that were not hardship enough, some business owners say, they have also had to contend with unsympathetic landlords and the threat of eviction. 
 As many as three dozen downtown business owners have complained to the Association of the Bar of the City of New York that their landlords are trying to get rid of them, said Akira Arroyo, a lawyer at the bar association who refers commercial tenants to lawyers willing to represent them pro bono.
"We're getting a lot of these in now," Ms. Arroyo said. "I don't know what's motivating these landlords. You'd think that they would want to keep the tenants they have."
Many of these commercial tenants were suffering from the economic downturn even before the World Trade Center attack. Most did not have insurance that would have protected them from an interruption in their business, and they realize that the law is not on their side. They say they are simply asking landlords to be sensitive to their situation. Landlords say they have to pay their mortgages, taxes and other expenses and cannot afford to serve as a crutch for struggling businesses.
"Nobody's coming to the landlord and saying, 'Let's help you out,' " said Dan Forrester, an owner of Transworld Equities, which has seven buildings in Lower Manhattan.
Some landlords in Lower Manhattan are nonprofit organizations, which use their rent income to finance social programs. For example, the Collegiate Church, headquartered at 45 John Street, owns six commercial properties in Lower Manhattan, including the once-bustling subway arcade at 150 Fulton Street, a block from the World Trade Center, which is now practically deserted. 
Yuriy Davidov operates a tiny shoe repair shop in the arcade. Since the Sept. 11 attacks, he said, his revenue has dropped to as little as $40 a day from $200. "Normally, I work all day, and I cannot pick my head up," said Mr. Davidov, an immigrant from Uzbekistan. "Now, I'm all day reading newspapers and smoking cigarettes."
His neighbors have not fared any better. Most of the hangers in the dry cleaner next door are holding unclaimed garments left there before Sept. 11, and two of the other half-dozen arcade tenants, a framing store and a coffee shop, have folded.
Rubin Shin, who owns Alex's Barber Shop and pays $3,000 a month for his arcade space, said his business was down by about 85 percent. "Before we were paying for prime retail space," he said. "Now it's just the subway, not the subway near the World Trade Center."
Mr. Davidov and Mr. Shin have asked the church for a rent reduction, but have succeeded only in buying some time. "I called them up and said, 'Please don't squeeze me,' " said Mr. Davidov, who pays $1,140 in rent a month. 
Casey R. Kemper, the portfolio manager for the church's real estate, said he could not comment on individual cases. "In general," he said, "we've only been able to go so far." He said the church was trying to resolve differences with its insurance carrier about whether it could collect for the period when the building was closed.
Mr. Kemper said the church empathized with the tenants' plight and was trying to behave responsibly. At the same time, he said, the institution cannot allow its social programs to suffer. "The purpose of our being landlords is to support our four churches -- their programs and their benevolences for the community," he said. "That's why we're in the real estate business."
The Collegiate Church has not issued any eviction notices, but other landlords have been more aggressive.
At Golden Island, a five-year-old jewelry store on Chambers Street, Danny Pehzman, the owner, recently received a three-day notice, the first step in an eviction proceeding.
Mr. Pehzman said he had asked for a break on his monthly rent of $8,000 because he lost five weeks' worth of business, in part because the street was often closed to traffic after the attack. He said he was stuck with unclaimed merchandise ordered by customers who no longer want to travel to Lower Manhattan. The state's grant program for small businesses was not much help because he was eligible for just 1.2 percent of his gross receipts, which last year amounted to only $115,000. Like many store owners in Lower Manhattan, he was unable to get a loan from the federal Small Business Administration.
His landlord, Mr. Forrester, said other tenants were managing to pay their rent, though. The jewelry store, which is near the corner of Chambers and Church Streets, is about eight blocks from ground zero and thus too far away to have drawn its customers from the World Trade Center, he said. "They're using this awful tragedy, the fact that people have lost their lives, as a way to posture for rent reduction," Mr. Forrester said.
For 23 years, the Shasho family has sold everything from electronics to jewelry in a storefront at the corner of Nassau and Fulton Streets, but for the last two years, the store has been called Vitamins R Us. The current owner, Harry Shasho, who said he was six weeks behind in his $5,600-a-month rent, has received an eviction notice but hopes that the landlord can be talked out of further steps. "It's stupid for a landlord to evict a tenant that's been around for three years or more," Mr. Shasho said.
Mr. Shasho's landlord, a company called Small Commercial Property Owners Group, has sued the Shashos before. "He really needs a push to get him to come up with the rent," said a spokesman for the landlord, who refused to give his name. "We've not evicted him in the past. We're not going to put him out."

HEADLINE: Hold the Mayo, and the Sandwich: Exchange Bans Deliveries 

BYLINE:  By EDWARD WYATT 

 BODY:
In embattled Lower Manhattan, major corporations have fled, businesses have folded, and now, even lunch is under siege. 
 The New York Stock Exchange, arguably the largest downtown employer of people with incentives to eat at their desks, outlawed food deliveries to the floor of the exchange last month. Stock exchange traders, who previously waited patiently each day for delivery of their salami and Snapple, now must go outside themselves or send a clerk to pick up their food and bring it back, pausing to pass their sandwiches through an X-ray machine on the street behind the exchange as they return to the building. 
 This might seem to be an insignificant event, but the delicatessens, diners and sandwich shops of Lower Manhattan, many of them dependent almost exclusively on lunch revenue, had already been suffering from a loss of customers as a result of the World Trade Center disaster. Now the delivery ban has dealt what, for some, might be the final blow. 
"Half of my lunch business went to the floor of the New York Stock Exchange," said Richard Weiner, the owner of Wolf's Delicatessen, in the basement of the former Equitable building at 120 Broadway.
Though the deli is barely more than a block from the exchange, business has now fallen by 50 percent, he said, adding, "You can't lose $3,000 a week in business when you're struggling to begin with and really make a go of it."
Mr. Weiner is not alone. For the owners of many restaurants and delis in the financial district, the traders on the floor -- the foot soldiers on the front lines of capitalism -- were their biggest customers. The proceeds from those daily rations sent the lunch suppliers' sons and daughters to college and paid for vacations from the 12-hour days of running a small business.
Few institutions dominate the financial and psychological health of their neighborhoods like the New York Stock Exchange does that of Lower Manhattan. When stock prices are up and traders are making money, the effects trickle down to the boot blacks and the cigar salesmen. When stocks are struggling and traders dour, fruit vendors and, most certainly, restaurant owners, suffer, too.
A spokeswoman for the exchange said that she could not comment on the exchange's lunch delivery policy because "it is a security issue." Many traders who work on the floor, asked about the matter as they returned from picking up their lunches last week, also declined to comment.
But a New York Stock Exchange official and an executive of a large trading firm, both of whom spoke on the condition of anonymity, each confirmed details of the new policy. They said the change was made because of concerns that a delivery person could easily slip a bomb into a sandwich bag that could elude the X-ray machines and bomb-sniffing dogs that already surround the stock exchange building, which is considered by many law-enforcement officials as one of the main terrorist targets in Manhattan.
The trading firm official noted that with volume down on the stock exchange, most firms have no trouble finding clerks to send out to pick up lunch. But stock traders, perhaps more so than most people, are creatures of habit, and it was more convenient to be able to send a clerk out to the sidewalk in front of the building to pick up an order from a delivery person -- as was allowed under the former rules -- than it is to dispatch a clerk several blocks to a restaurant or deli. 
And with a cafeteria and a formal dining room in the building, far more traders are now staying inside for lunch.
It is not just the stock traders' deliveries that have changed in the lunch landscape of Lower Manhattan, which has lost more than 100,000 workers since Sept. 11. Workers who remain downtown said they have only recently started to venture out at lunchtime.
Fred Aaron, a lawyer for an insurance company, said he regularly used to walk the six blocks from his office on Pine Street to J & R Music World on Park Row to browse among the compact discs at lunchtime, often stopping to eat a sandwich or, at least, pick one up to take back to his desk. Now, he said: "It's too depressing. If I go out, I stay closer to the office."
Jason Bilanin, who works at Chase Manhattan Plaza, said that before Sept. 11, he often strolled several blocks to the South Street Seaport at lunchtime to take in the fresh air and, along the way, get a bite to eat. On Tuesday, he was eating at Zeytuna, a restaurant on Maiden Lane, barely a block from his office.
"It was three weeks before I started going out at all," Mr. Bilanin said. "Now, I don't venture as far as I used to. I don't know when it will get back to normal."
Some upscale restaurants are finding that business has picked up, and they say they are looking forward to the holiday season. Corrado Goglia, a manager at Delmonico's, the landmark restaurant on Beaver Street, said that its lunch and dinner business was back to 75 percent of normal and bookings for December were nearly 90 percent full.
But restaurants that are more dependent on lunch -- many of which do not serve dinner -- are feeling a far tighter pinch.
"Like all of the restaurants down here, the stock exchange was really the backbone of our business," said Peter M. Semetis, the owner of Sale & Pepe, a restaurant and catering business at the intersection of Broadway and Exchange Place.
Mr. Semetis said his deliveries to the exchange have dropped from about 55 to 10 a day. "The traders make their money by watching the screens, watching the stocks on the Big Board," he said. "A lot of them are just not going to go out to pick something up."
Tighter security is affecting restaurants in other ways as well. In mid-August, Mr. Weiner moved Wolf's Delicatessen to the basement concourse of the Equitable building from its longtime location on Trinity Place at Edgar Street. Though the new site does not have frontage on the street, Mr. Weiner said he was encouraged by the chance to more than double the restaurant's seating capacity, to 200. 
In addition, an exit from the Wall Street Station of the No. 4 and 5 subway lines emptied into the Equitable concourse in front of his door. With thousands of potential customers striding by each morning, at least a few were certain to stop for an egg sandwich and coffee, he said.
Since Sept. 11, however, heightened security at the building has left the subway entrance closed. Moreover, anyone who wants to visit the restaurant has to provide a photo ID and sign in to get into the building, arguably a disincentive for someone out for a quick bite for lunch. 
Add to that the fact that phone service was out for weeks, certainly a drawback for a business heavily dependent on call-in orders.
"My wife and I borrowed a ton of money to move into this place," Mr. Weiner said.
The restaurant space had been empty for nearly 12 years, he said, and needed substantial renovation as well as new furniture.
Mr. Semetis, of Sale & Pepe, has similar woes. Express buses from Brooklyn and Queens used to stop directly outside his shop on Trinity Place. Now, they have been rerouted elsewhere, and his morning walk-in traffic has dropped by 80 percent. 
"People are not going to walk out of their way for coffee and a muffin," Mr. Semetis said. In the meantime, he added, corporations as well as individuals are watching their spending, on catering as well as other expenses.
Both Mr. Semetis and Mr. Weiner are taking advantage of aid programs being offered to downtown businesses. Sale & Pepe was one of the recipients of an award from the grant, loan and wage subsidy program sponsored by the Alliance for Downtown Manhattan and Seedco, a community development organization. And Wolf's Delicatessen was chosen to receive free consulting services by Stern Rebuilds, a program organized by New York University's Stern School of Business. 
Neither of them knows, however, if that help will be enough. "We've been down here forever," Mr. Weiner said. "For Wall Street to be without Wolf's would be a crying shame. But that's a real possibility."

HEADLINE: Bargains for Buyers May Also Hold Risk Of Slower Recovery 

BYLINE:  By DAVID LEONHARDT 

 BODY:
Attention, shoppers: America is now on sale.
 Airlines and hotels are offering deep discounts. Carmakers are extending interest-free loans. Department stores have already marked many items down sharply. The price of computers continues to plummet. 
 Commercial rents are falling for the first time in a decade. Businesses are paying less for many basic materials than they were a few months ago. And a gallon of gasoline costs 25 percent less than it did in June. 
In industry after industry, companies find themselves with too many products in their warehouses and too much machinery on their factory floors, even after a year of economic weakness and corporate cost-cutting. One result, in many parts of the economy, is a lingering glut of goods and accompanying price cuts.
For all the benefits that the nationwide sale has brought to consumers, it also carries a darker side: that the United States could suffer an extended period of declining prices, known as deflation, which could deepen the first recession in 10 years.
Over all, even though the cost of services is still rising, consumer prices have remained flat over the last six months, the first time in 15 years they have failed to rise over a sustained period. The prices that businesses pay for crude materials have fallen for six consecutive months, and, in October, dropped 9.1 percent. Since the government began keeping such statistics in 1947, the only larger monthly decline came in February this year.
For now, the absence of inflation is one of the few bright spots for consumers, whose holiday spending will go a long way toward determining how quickly the economy emerges from its downturn.
The fall in energy prices alone has given households an additional $10 billion in spending money, or $100 a household, over the last five months, according to Economy.com, a consulting firm in West Chester, Pa. The average price for a gallon of gas -- $1.20 -- is back where it was in 1985.
Should the price declines spread further, many businesses would be forced to begin yet another round of job cuts. In a deflationary economy, such as now prevails in Japan, wages drop as well, and people and businesses struggle to pay off debts, which effectively become larger as the value of money declines.
Most economists consider that unlikely in the United States, saying aggressive steps by the Federal Reserve have pumped billions of dollars into the economy, helping to stabilize prices and lift demand next year.
Still, the extent of the price decreases, and the oversupply of products causing them, suggest that the economic recovery is unlikely to be a robust one, many analysts say. In October, companies used only 74.8 percent of their industrial capacity, the lowest level since 1983, as many continued to suffer a hangover from their overly optimistic purchasing of new equipment in the late 90's.
Even if demand for their products begins to rise soon, businesses will not increase their investments again until they are using more of their existing capacity, economists say. "Inventories are still excessive, and companies are suffering a squeeze on profit margins," said John Lonski, chief economist at Moody's Investors Service, the credit rating agency. "That tells me that at best the recovery is going to be modest."
The recent price declines follow years of mild inflation that, according to many economic models, should have gradually picked up steam as the economy boomed in the second half of the 1990's. Instead, a strong dollar and a flood of imports helped keep inflation low, forcing businesses to increase profits primarily by becoming more efficient rather than raising prices.
Between 1992 and 1999, inflation on consumer goods never exceeded 3.5 percent over a 12-month period. In previous booms, it sometimes reached 6 percent or more.
When the United States economy seemed to fall into recession this year, inflation all but disappeared. The one exception was oil prices, because producers found themselves without enough supply to meet the surge of demand as Asian countries recovered from their financial crisis of the late 90's. But by the summer, the economic slowdown -- which had spread to nearly every large country in the world -- depressed energy prices, too.
After energy, the biggest recent price declines have come in industries that are operating far below capacity.
The starkest case is technology. Prices for computers and semiconductors have been falling for years, as advances have cut costs and manufacturers have become far more efficient. Throughout the 90's, though, profits continued to rise as both consumers and businesses quickly replaced old equipment with the latest innovations.
But businesses sharply reduced their technology budgets at the end of last year, deciding, at least temporarily, that they already owned all the equipment they needed. Computer manufacturers were forced to curtail production; their output fell last month to 61.3 percent of capacity -- a record low -- down from 80 percent a year ago.
Price cuts have accelerated over the same period, and computers are about 30 percent less expensive than they were a year ago, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
But there is a price to pay for too much of a good thing. Widespread price declines "are a double-edged sword for U.S. companies," said Edward McKelvey, a senior economist at Goldman, Sachs & Company. "One company's cost is another company's output price."
Even some industries that have been shrinking in recent years find themselves with excess production capacity. The United States textile industry, under relentless pressure from overseas, has become smaller in each of the last five years. But the industry still finds itself bloated and forced to cut prices. A flood of imports from Asian countries that had devalued their currencies in the late 90's was already restraining inflation. The worldwide slowdown in demand has caused the price of many fabrics to decline in recent months.
David Link, chief economist for the American Textile Manufacturers Institute, said that more than twice as many plants had closed in 2001 as in any previous year. Even Malden Mills, the well-known maker of Polartec fleece, is flirting with bankruptcy.
In recent weeks, expectations have shifted as well. Next year, consumers, on average, think inflation will be only 0.4 percent, according to a survey released last week by the University of Michigan. That is the lowest expectation since the 1950's.
"It's stunning," said Richard T. Curtin, the university's director of consumer surveys. 
If those expectations continue to decline, they will aggravate fears of a deflationary spiral, in which people begin to save money because they are worried about layoffs, salary cuts and debt payments and because they expect the prices of many products to fall in the months ahead.
But economists said the recession would have to deepen significantly, and perhaps drag on for years, before deflation became a genuine threat. 
"I'm not worried we're going to have a Great Depression," Olivier Blanchard, an economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said. "And if we don't have a Great Depression, we're not going to have deflation."
Analysts note the prices for many goods and services are still increasing. Supermarket and restaurant food, residential rent and health care have all become more expensive in each of the last three months, according to government statistics.
The economy should also benefit from the lack of the kind of real estate bubble that hampered the United States in the 1980's and Japan throughout the 1990's. Although vacancy rates for commercial office space have spiked -- sending rents lower than they were 12 months ago for the first time since 1993 -- they are unlikely to approach the levels they reached in the early 90's, according to Torto Wheaton Research.
A broad fall in real estate prices creates acute problems for many people and businesses because they must continue to meet the payments on their mortgages, even as their investments lose value.
But perhaps the strongest sign that deflation remains unlikely, analysts say, is consumers' predictions about how long inflation will remain completely absent. Over the next five years, according to the Michigan survey, consumers expect prices to rise by an average of 2.8 percent a year.
"Hardly anyone is concerned about rising prices," Mr. Curtin said. "But even fewer people think it's better to wait to buy."

HEADLINE: A NATION CHALLENGED: THE ARAB-AMERICANS; 
After Sept. 11, Complaints of Job Bias Mount

BYLINE:  By PAM BELLUCK 

 BODY:
The complaints are coming from all corners of the country and from people in all types of industries -- from an airplane mechanic in Texas to a Wal-Mart greeter in Virginia.
 Since Sept. 11, Arab-American groups say, hundreds of people have said they are experiencing discrimination in the workplace because of their nationality or religion. 
 Nearly 100 people have filed complaints with the Federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, and others have decided to sue over what they perceive as a backlash against people of Arab descent. Their advocates say that the number of complaints to the commission would be higher but that many Arabs and Arab-Americans are suspicious of the federal government. 
Of the complaints that have been filed, Reginald Welch, a spokesman for the commission, said: "These people say they were singled out for mistreatment, they were harassed, or they were fired. Something happened on the job that they believe would not have happened if it were not for Sept. 11 and if they were not perceived to be of Middle Eastern descent." 
But a look at a handful of complaints suggests the circumstances may be murkier than that. Companies forcefully deny any discrimination. Some said the crippled economy was the culprit, forcing them to lay off many people, not only those of Middle Eastern descent. Others said workers were fired because of behavior or performance problems.
In at least a couple of cases, it appears that tensions arising from the terrorist attacks might have led to an employee being fired, but the employees and employers tell different stories. 
Fatmah Anabtawi of Island Park, N.Y., said she was fired from the Island Park Laundromat because she is a Muslim. Ms. Anabtawi, 44, a Jordanian-born American citizen, said the owner of the self-service laundromat told her on Sept. 14 that customers were scared of her.
"He said, 'They are scared you want to put a bomb in my store,' " said Ms. Anabtawi, who worked part time at the laundry, washing, drying and folding. 
The owner, John Weber, said that he fired Ms. Anabtawi because of comments she made after the Sept. 11 attacks that he said caused some customers to threaten to boycott the store. 
"She said to me, 'America had it coming,' " Mr. Weber said. "I said: 'You know, Fatmah, not for nothing, but that comment offended me. I don't want you saying anything to any of our customers.' That week I got complaints from my customers, customers' husbands, local merchants. She's in my store, my place of business and she's constantly praising Saddam Hussein. She got fired because of her own actions." 
In Ashburn, Va., Ossama Elkoshairi, 66, said discrimination had cost him his job as a greeter at a Wal-Mart in Fairfax. Mr. Elkoshairi said that he was teased and harassed by two employees who pointed at him and said, " 'He did it,' " and that one held up a picture of Osama bin Laden.
Mr. Elkoshairi, an Egyptian-born American citizen, said that wanting to ensure the employees knew he condemned Mr. bin Laden, he replied that if Mr. bin Laden was responsible, he himself would slaughter him.
Several days later, Mr. Elkoshairi said, he was called into the manager's office and questioned for two hours by Wal-Mart officials and an F.B.I. agent about his behavior and views on Afghanistan and American bombing. He was then fired and, he said, told he was not permitted to enter any Wal-Mart or Sam's Club stores. 
Tom Williams, a Wal-Mart spokesman, would not discuss the case, but said the termination had been for "inappropriate conduct." 
In several other cases, companies said the firings of people of Arab descent were unrelated to Sept. 11.
Mamdouh Bayoumy, a 47-year-old Egyptian, has filed a complaint with the commission against an Amarillo, Tex., aircraft service company, where he had started work as a mechanic on Sept. 10. Mr. Bayoumy said he was fired on Sept. 17 and given no explanation, so he said he concluded that it was because of his nationality and religion.
Mike Manclark, president of the company, Leading Edge Aviation, disputes that. 
"He was flat-out fired because he's a terrible mechanic," Mr. Manclark said. "He was awful. A task that should take an hour, this gentleman would take eight to do."
Mr. Manclark made a point of saying that one of his managers has a Middle Eastern background, and that Mr. Bayoumy was told why he was fired. "I don't care where he's from," Mr. Manclark said. "I don't care if he's purple if the guy can turn a wrench. He is using this event as a tool. He's trying to get money out of it."
Mr. Bayoumy has filed another complaint in a different case. He said a San Antonio recruitment office promised him a job on a Boeing contract, but then turned him away, saying that Boeing was not comfortable with his background. 
The recruitment concern, On Site Companies, referred calls to Boeing. A Boeing spokesman, Paul Guse, would not comment on specific cases, but said the company has strict hiring procedures to avoid discrimination.
Leaders of Arab-American groups say some complaints involve treatment by co-workers or bosses. 
"People who used to joke with them didn't return hellos," said Hodan Hassan, a civil rights coordinator for the Council on American-Islamic Relations, an Islamic advocacy group. "Some say e-mails would go unanswered. Co-workers have anti-Muslim and anti-Islam conversations that were loud enough for them to hear, saying things like all Muslims should be deported." 
The advocates say they believe there is more discrimination than is being reported to the commission because of suspicion of the federal government among some Arabs and Arab-Americans. Adele Rapport, regional attorney for the commission in Detroit, said she believed that was why only nine complaints had been filed through her office, including that of a man who claimed a co-worker followed him everywhere, even to the bathroom. 
Still, in several cases where employees complained of discriminatory firing, the companies blame the economy. Sofy Moussa, an Egyptian-American from Ashburn, Va., said she lost her job with the BDM Corporation., which provides logistics and training to the military, because of her ethnicity. 
Tom Fintel, the chief executive of BDM, a subsidiary of TRW, said the contract Ms. Moussa was working on ended and virtually all the employees in her section were laid off.
Arsalaan Siddiqi, a 27-year-old Pakistani living in Herndon, Va., said his employer, Veres Consulting, reneged on a promise to sponsor him for a work visa, saying he was told "their patriotic duty demanded they hire an American." 
John Burnham, a senior manager at Veres, which conducts surveys for nonprofit associations, said the reason was economic. He said companies can sponsor visa applicants only if they cannot find a qualified American, and the softening economy made that claim unsupportable.
"I wouldn't be surprised if he felt that way," Mr. Burnham said of Mr. Siddiqi. "Arsalaan's a good guy. I felt bad that this happened to him."

HEADLINE: A NATION CHALLENGED: HOMELAND SECURITY; 
Security Quest Also Offers Opportunities

BYLINE:  By ALISON MITCHELL 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 24 

 BODY:
Tom Ridge, the director of homeland security, likes to say the home-front battle against terrorism is not just the business of government but of business. Business agrees.
 Ever since Mr. Ridge stepped into the West Wing of the White House early last month, corporate executives, start-up companies and industry trade groups have been clamoring for his attention. Already he and his aides have huddled with dozens of corporate representatives. 
 And after the Pentagon asked entrepreneurs last month to come forward with proposals to combat terrorism and counter weapons of mass destruction, thousands of ideas were submitted.
"We were somewhat surprised by the response," said Maj. Mike Halbig, a Pentagon spokesman.
Some companies contact Mr. Ridge's office only to find out that he does not actually award contracts.
One company, PointSource Technologies in California, has hired a premier Washington lobbying firm -- Akin Gump, Strauss, Heuer & Feld -- to find out how to get financing.
"We're trying to feel our way right now, where to go, who to talk to," said Dr. Gregory M. Quist, the company's president, who thinks his firm's research into detecting naturally occurring pathogens in water could be modified to fight bioterrorism.
"It's a confusion," Dr. Quist said. "It's a big maze and we're a new company."
Mr. Ridge says security "will tap the creative genius and resources of both the public and private sector." But others fear that homeland defense could become a special-interest boondoggle with the potential to grow into an industry akin to the military-industrial complex spurred by World War II. 
"In response to an immediate crisis, this is all an appropriate unification for the national good," said Gene Kimmelman, the Washington co-director for Consumers Union, speaking of the cooperation between government and industry.
"It starts smacking of the military-industrial complex if it goes on for too long and spreads beyond the immediate national need in responding to a crisis," Mr. Kimmelman added.
Already, the troubled airline industry received a $15 billion bailout from Congress after Sept. 11. The insurance industry is seeking assistance. And in the name of strengthening the economy, some industries are seeking special deals in the economic stimulus legislation that is pending on Capitol Hill.
Mr. Kimmelman said he was concerned about industries using the crisis to seek overly broad relief from regulation or antitrust laws and said it was already happening.
He points to a section of a $3.2 billion bioterrorism bill sponsored by Senators Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts, and Bill Frist, Republican of Tennessee, that gives government the power for three years to pre-empt antitrust laws for companies like drug makers.
The drug companies say they need such protection to allow them to share information with the federal government and plot a strategy to produce vaccines against agents of bioterrorism.
Mr. Ridge says he knows the government must be careful not to repeat the 1980's, when the Pentagon was pilloried for the $600 toilet seat. But he is also welcoming to entrepreneurs who want to help develop high-tech security measures.
"Look, part of that entrepreneurial spirit is, 'Hey, we make a product; we might make a buck,' " he said in a recent interview, laughing. "We look to American creativity to help solve our problems and to help make a profit in the process. That's what drives them. That's what really drives the research. That's what pays for the research."
He is even considering hiring "special employees" from the private sector to work on homeland defense in 60- to 90-day spurts. Such employees are usually not subject to the same kind of stringent financial disclosure rules and postgovernment employment restrictions as full-time White House officials.
By its very nature, homeland defense requires close cooperation between government and industry because much of the nation's vital infrastructure -- from telecommunications networks to power plants to water supplies -- is in private hands. And Mr. Ridge likens his drive to spur technological innovation to the government-industry effort that led to the national production boom after the attack on Pearl Harbor.
"It will be an American response to a challenge just like we responded to things in World War II," he said.
Franklin D. Roosevelt brought business leaders into policy-making positions and set up boards that developed manpower policy, controlled distribution of resources and worked with business and labor to bring about an enormous industrial mobilization.
But two decades later, as he was leaving the White House, Dwight D. Eisenhower felt the need to warn of the "acquisition of unwarranted influence" by the arms industry.
Some officials and consumer groups are already expressing concerns that the partnership between government and industry could become too close.
Representative Henry A. Waxman, Democrat of California, who has tangled with the Bush administration over its refusal to reveal the names of industry officials who advised a White House energy task force, raised some concerns about the potential for abuse in Mr. Ridge's idea for special employees.
"I would want some kind of Congressional oversight to be sure the relationships are not getting too mixed up so that without thinking about it government policy becomes the policy that is in the interest of the private companies rather than the public," Mr. Waxman said.
Many industries used to put their lobbying might into battling against big government. But after Sept. 11, with security measures likely to mean delays in commerce, many companies are suddenly seeking a larger government.
William J. Canary, the head of the American Trucking Associations, has written to Mr. Ridge calling for a "proper infrastructure" to be developed at the nation's ports of entry in order to speed truck traffic.
"This included not only bricks and mortar, but more importantly adequate levels of human resources and investment in systems and technologies that can ensure the efficient movement of legitimate cargo across our borders," Mr. Canary wrote.
In testimony before the Senate, the chemical industry recently called for the Department of Justice to get financing to speed a comprehensive assessment of the industry's vulnerabilities as well as for "significant federal funding" to increase the security of rail transportation.
Frederick L. Webber, the president of the American Chemistry Council, even said in that testimony that the industry's security should come under the jurisdiction of Mr. Ridge.
At a White House meeting last month, about a dozen executives in the pharmaceutical industry offered to send industry scientists to join the government effort to battle bioterrorism and to follow government direction, in exchange for liability and antitrust protections.
Richard J. Markham, the chief executive of Aventis Pharma, according to participants, told Mr. Ridge that the industry needed a road map from federal officials about what the threat is, what vaccines the government was likely to need, and what antibiotics should be made and by when. 
"In very general terms, we were discussing a major research initiative," said Alan F. Holmer, the president of the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America. "We need to be advised by the government what the threat is and what the priority is."

HEADLINE: Closure? A Buzzword Becomes a Quest 

BYLINE:  By SHAILA K. DEWAN 

 BODY:
A legal secretary who lives in Brooklyn returned to the site of the twin towers on Oct. 11 in search of it. A Bronx businessman designed an itinerary so his relatives, visiting from Nigeria for their daughter's funeral, could get it. The mayor has sought to give it to bereaved families in the form of urns filled with ashes. A woman whose husband's body was identified does not mention that she has it, because other widows do not.
 Virtually everyone, it seems, is looking for closure. 
 In the aftermath of Sept. 11, the term has gone from a buzzword to a commonplace, used as frequently by families and firefighters as by politicians and newscasters.
When Mark Green patched things up with his opponent, Fernando Ferrer, after the Democratic mayoral runoff, he cited the need for it. So did an emergency medical technician from Queens who was asked why he was getting a 9-11 memorial tattoo on his arm. "I don't know," he shrugged. "Closure?"
Despite its ring of authority, closure, in the popular sense of the word, is generally not to be found in psychology textbooks. In self-help meetings, courtrooms and politics, it has become shorthand for which the longhand is unclear. And not only is it not a clinical term, mental health professionals say, it represents a flawed concept whose overuse could do more harm than good.
In a time of war, terrorist alerts, anthrax scares and plane crashes, grief specialists and counselors worry that the notion of closure, which implies that emotions conform to a preordained agenda, is premature. It is, they say, symptomatic of a society that believes in getting on with things at all costs. ("The city has to keep going forward," Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani said the day that Flight 587 crashed.)
"It's associated with another phrase, which is a very strange one: 'Put it behind us,' " said Dennis Klass, editor of the book "Continuing Bonds: New Understandings of Grief" (Taylor & Francis, 1996) and a professor of religious studies at Webster University in St. Louis. "Maybe we put a contested election behind us. But we do not put death behind us. We do not put disaster -- or call it trauma -- behind us. We put either behind us at our own peril."
Even as the steppingstones that are supposed to lead to closure, from expedited death certificates to memorial services at ground zero, are carefully laid out for families to follow, some counselors are banning the concept altogether.
"We usually avoid that word because I don't think there really is a true closure," said Dr. Kerry J. Kelly, chief medical officer for the New York Fire Department. "The grieving continues, but in different ways."
Dr. Neal L. Cohen, the city's commissioner of health, said that fewer families than expected have taken the proffered, streamlined route to closure. (He called the term itself simplistic.) His office said just over 2,000 death certificates had been requested. 
The rest of the families, it appears, are moving at their own pace. "I have one client that was given a little container of dirt from the site, and it was like, 'Here, now go forth and be comforted,' " said Sandra Owens, a trauma and grief counselor who has worked with victims' families. "He was horrified. He was horrified."
The word closure implies an ending, Ms. Owens said, even as Americans are just beginning to adjust to a new reality. She sees the rush to closure as wishful thinking that things will return to normal. "Those who are looking so desperately for it, or who think they've found it, are just trying to anesthetize themselves to what's going on," she said.
Many grief experts see danger in denial. "We 'closed' the Oklahoma City bombing by killing Timothy McVeigh and then acting as if the disaffection that McVeigh represented isn't there," Dr. Klass said. "When we put things behind us and don't learn from them -- don't change our lives because now we know that -- that's not healthy."
But the chimera of closure holds out some alluring promises: an end to the pain of grief and a return to normalcy or even prosperity. The sooner, of course, the better. For companies dealing with a traumatized work force, there are economic reasons to encourage moving on. "Closure is a euphemism for: 'We've lost a hell of a lot of money, we can't lose any more, so if you value your job, get back on that computer screen,' " Ms. Owens said.
John R. Aiello, a professor at Rutgers who focuses on social and organizational psychology and has counseled employees at several companies since Sept. 11, agreed. "That's the bottom line," he said, cautioning, "I think it's shortsighted when companies go in that direction." Workers who fear losing their jobs may develop post-traumatic stress syndrome and other problems that impair productivity.
Closure is not a word with an easy definition. It means, well, you know, closure. Samuel J. Tenenbaum, a retired businessman and philanthropist in Columbia, S.C., helped lead an effort to raise enough money to buy a fire engine for New York, in return for a hose carriage that New York firefighters sent to Columbia when the city was devastated by fire after the Civil War. What, exactly, does he mean when he says the gesture will bring closure? "It brings closure to that era of conflict but also helps bring closure to this moment of contemporary disaster," Mr. Tenenbaum explained, adding, "It's a difficult concept to talk about."
Some date the widespread use of the term to the Oklahoma City bombing, others to the Monica Lewinsky debacle. From South Africa, with its Truth and Reconciliation Commission, to the Deep South, with its long-delayed trials of Klansmen, communities have dealt with closure. But typically, justice, or at least legal resolution, has been a component. With the World Trade Center, that aspect has fallen away, at least for now. 
"In my mind I'm thinking, going out to war, is that going to make everything all right?" said Minerva Mentor-Portillo, who buried her husband last month. With skepticism in her voice, she added, "Is that going to make my husband's death not in vain?"
For those closest to the tragedy, like Ms. Mentor-Portillo, closure means one thing: finding their loved ones' remains. In this new, upside-down world, that has come to be viewed as a blessing. And even counselors agree that if closure means confronting reality so it can begin to be assimilated, then it is all right.
For Kathleen Wik, whose husband worked for the Aon Corporation, the receipt of his body and his wedding ring has made his death something more real than a horrific event she watched on the news. But that does not mean her mourning is over. "Oh God, no. I think I've only just begun," she said. But there are few ways to put a name to her experience. "I got closure because I got his body. Is that the truest sense of the word? I don't know."

HEADLINE: A NATION CHALLENGED: THE LAW; 
Bush's New Rules to Fight Terror Transform the Legal Landscape

BYLINE:  By MATTHEW PURDY; This article was reported and written by Richard L. Berke, Christopher Drew, Steven Greenhouse, Steven Lee Myers, Robert Pear and Benjamin Weiser, with Mr. Purdy.

 BODY:
As Pentagon officials begin designing military tribunals for suspected terrorists, they are considering the possibility of trials on ships at sea or on United States installations, like the naval base in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. The proceedings promise to be swift and largely secret, with one military officer saying that the release of information might be limited to the barest facts, like the defendant's name and sentence. Transcripts of the proceedings, this officer said, could be kept from public view for years, perhaps decades.
 The military tribunals are the boldest initiative in a series of laws and rewritten federal regulations that, taken together, have created an alternate system of justice in the aftermath of Sept. 11, giving the government far greater power to detain, investigate and prosecute people suspected of involvement in terrorism. 
 Those changes, described by legal experts and government and law enforcement officials, are likely to affect mostly residents of the country who are not citizens but who, until now, have had many of the constitutional rights and protections of citizens. 
The Bush administration says its agenda commands strong public support, a view bolstered by recent polls. Even most critics acknowledge the need for enhanced security measures, but the administration's new approach has stirred unease both inside and outside government, as well as overseas. 
Some senior law enforcement officials believe that the military tribunals are unnecessary and that the government's record in prosecuting terrorists in federal court over the last decade justifies continuing that approach. Spanish officials told the United States last week that they would not extradite eight men suspected of involvement in the Sept. 11 attacks without assurances that their cases would be kept in civilian court. 
Although it remains unclear how widely these new powers will ultimately be applied, the provisions alter some basic principles of the American judicial system -- like the right to a jury trial, the privacy of the attorney-client relationship and strong protections against the use of preventive detention.
The steps taken by the administration reflect outrage that the Sept. 11 terrorists were foreigners who lived freely and undetected in the United States, even though some had violated their visas, and the fear that potential terrorists or people with information about terrorist acts are among the millions of immigrants in the country.
"We're an open society, we give people access to the American dream," said Dan Bartlett, the White House communications director. "With that privilege there is a responsibility. That responsibility has not always been lived up to, and it's not always been asked that they live up to it, either."
President Bush's authorization of secret military tribunals for noncitizens accused of terrorism and the systematic interviewing of 5,000 young Middle Eastern men in the country on temporary visas is well known. But broad new powers are also contained in more obscure provisions.
A recent rule change published without announcement in the Federal Register gives the government wide latitude to keep noncitizens in detention even when an immigration judge has ordered them freed.
And under new laws, the attorney general can detain for deportation any noncitizen who he has "reasonable grounds to believe" is "engaged in any activity that endangers the national security of the United States," according to a recent internal Immigration and Naturalization Service memorandum.
Critics have said that the administration's measures often mean singling out people on the basis of nationality or ethnicity.
"We have decided to trade off the liberty of immigrants -- particularly Arabs and Muslims -- for the purported security of the majority," said David Cole, a law professor at Georgetown University who often represents detained foreigners.
In the guidelines for carrying out the 5,000 interviews with young Middle Eastern men, Attorney General John Ashcroft wrote to federal prosecutors that the selection of the men was not meant to imply "that one ethnic group or religious group is more prone to terrorism than another." Yet local law enforcement officials in several cities have balked at carrying out the interviews because of the impression of profiling.
Secrecy is a hallmark of the wartime judicial system, just as the free flow of information is a signature of the nation's normal criminal procedures. The names of about a dozen people being detained for months as material witnesses in the Sept. 11 investigation have been kept confidential because, officials explain, they are witnesses in grand jury proceedings. In ordinary cases, while grand jury proceedings are closed to the public, witnesses are rarely held in jail.
A full accounting of law enforcement activity related to the Sept. 11 investigation has not been made public. The Justice Department has not said precisely how many people are being detained, how many have been questioned and released and where people are being held and on what charges.
The new administration powers, amassed during wartime, have made the normally delicate balance between individual rights and collective security that much more precarious.
"My view on the military tribunals will be formed by how they're used," said Warren B. Rudman, the former Republican senator from New Hampshire and the chairman of the president's foreign intelligence advisory board. "If they're done carefully and with deliberation -- and I really expect they will be -- I don't have a problem with it.
"As far as ethnic profiling; it's very troubling. It pains me to say this, but some of it may have to be done. We just have to recognize that we cannot bend over backwards in our innate American fairness to overlook that there are some people trying to hurt us."

The Act
Bill With Long Name, And Longer Reach
The biggest changes in the government's power over residents who are not citizens were spelled out in a law known as the U.S.A. Patriot Act, hastily passed after the attacks. The measure's potential reach is summarized in the full name that was needed to create that acronym -- the Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001.
Besides providing more money to strengthen border security, the act greatly expands the notion of who should be considered a terrorist and provides the attorney general with remarkable personal powers to detain such people.
In the past, entry into the United States was denied only to members of 28 groups that were formally designated as terrorist organizations by the State Department. But under the new law, any foreigner who publicly endorses terrorist activity, or belongs to a group that does, can be turned away at the border or deported.
The term "terrorist activity" has also been broadened to include any foreigner who uses "dangerous devices" or raises money for a terrorist group, whether or not he or she knows the group is engaged in terrorism. And perhaps most strikingly, the law allows the government to detain any foreigners whom the attorney general certifies as endangering national security.
The attorney general can order such detention if he simply has "reasonable grounds to believe" that the foreigner might be a threat. The Justice Department has to bring criminal or deportation charges against such people within seven days, but it can hold them indefinitely.
Mr. Ashcroft has said that such aggressive detention policies are "vital to preventing, disrupting or delaying new attacks. It is difficult for a person in jail or under detention to murder innocent people or to aid or abet in terrorism." 
The administration has also changed rules to make it easier for officials to keep watch on both citizens and noncitizens while they are in federal custody. In one change, it has eased officials' ability to eavesdrop on communications between lawyers and their clients in federal custody when it would "deter future acts of violence or terrorism."
Defense lawyers say that new rule erodes a basic right of the accused to confer privately with their lawyers. But civil liberties lawyers have found more to object to in the wide provisions of the Patriot Act. 
Noel Saleh, an immigration lawyer and vice president of the Arab Community Center for Economic and Social Services in Detroit, called the act "an extremely dangerous law in terms of the very expansive definition of the concept of terrorism. The consequences of being labeled a terrorist are extreme in that one can be detained indefinitely."
Mr. Saleh added, "That could theoretically happen to someone who at the end of Ramadan does their charitable tithing to an orphanage in South Lebanon that was established by Hezbollah." 
Law enforcement officials have said they have not used the new powers yet because they already have enough authority to detain material witnesses and visa violators who have been picked up in the investigations.
The officials also said that many arrests of Middle Eastern men have been made not as a result of profiling but from a flood of tips pouring in about suspicious activities. And in many cases, the focus on Arabs and Muslims simply reflects the public's perception of where the current dangers lie.
Mr. Saleh said that since Sept. 11, the immigration service has held some of the detainees longer than usual by opposing their release on bail, forcing them to appeal to judges for bonds, a process that can add three to four weeks to their time in jail.
"I obviously think that this is improper," said Mr. Saleh, who represents six Middle Eastern clients detained in the recent investigations. "It's an abuse of discretion." Still, Mr. Saleh said he would not complain about what others see as selective enforcement, because clamping down on visa violators is what the immigration service is "supposed to do." 
And if anything, some law enforcement officials say, the agency has been too timid. Conscious of the concerns about racial profiling, the agency has been reluctant to cull its files for people who have overstayed their visas, and it has generally detained only those Middle Easterners who have been of interest to the F.B.I.
It also has begun to turn back some visitors who once would have passed easily into the country.
At the F.B.I.'s prodding, in mid-October, the immigration service refused entry at Kennedy International Airport in New York to a Jordanian who is an official of the Palestine Liberation Organization, law enforcement officials said. They said the man was on his way from Cairo to Los Angeles to do something that suddenly seemed a little worrisome: he was planning to attend flight school. He was put back on a plane to Cairo.

The Tribunals
Swift, Secret Justice, And No Appeals
At the Pentagon, very little has been disclosed regarding the shape of the military tribunals that President Bush has ordered, but one thing is clear: they will be unlike any judicial proceedings in this country since the end of World War II.
Suspected terrorists will be tried not before a jury but rather a commission made up primarily -- though not necessarily exclusively -- of military officers. The suspects and their lawyers, who may also be military officers appointed to represent them, will be tried without the same access to the evidence against them that defendants in civilian trials have. The evidence of their guilt does not have to meet the familiar standard "beyond reasonable doubt" but must simply "have probative value to a reasonable person."
There will be no appeals.
"The commission itself is going to be unique," said one military officer involved in the discussions. "It will be separate and distinct from a civilian criminal trial. It will be separate and distinct from a court-martial."
Mr. Bush's order establishing the tribunals -- issued on Nov. 13 not as an executive order but rather as a military order by the president in his constitutional capacity as commander in chief of the armed forces -- set only broad guidelines for the tribunals. It said, for example, that convictions and sentences could be reached by only a two-thirds vote of the commission's members. It also left to Mr. Bush himself the decision on who would face prosecution in the tribunals.
The rest of the details -- the rules of evidence, the composition of the tribunals, the forums to be used -- are now being debated inside the Pentagon.
Secretary of Defense Donald H. Rumsfeld said that he had ordered the Pentagon's civilian general counsel, William J. Haynes 2nd, to begin drafting the procedures.
"The president's order is not terribly specific," one senior officer said. "Who prosecutes? Who defends? All of those things are up for grabs right now."
So far no one has been brought up before a tribunal, though some administration and Pentagon officials said it could happen soon. Officials are debating whether to prosecute Zacarias Moussaoui, 33, a French citizen of Moroccan descent being held in New York, through the tribunal process.
Mr. Bush's aides justified his decision by citing similar tribunals held throughout American history, from the Revolution through the Civil War and international tribunals in Nuremberg after World War II.
Mr. Bush's decision has provoked criticism from across the political spectrum, but legal experts are divided over the tribunals.
Phillip Allen Lacovara, a former deputy solicitor general, said military tribunals promised a more proportional prosecution of what, in the case of the attacks of Sept. 11, amounted to crimes of war than any criminal trial in a civilian court could.
Some federal law enforcement officials questioned the need for tribunals, given the government's success at convicting terrorists in civilian courts. But Mr. Lacovara noted the length of those prosecutions, including the trials of some of those charged in the 1993 World Trade Center bombing. He said the Bush administration was almost certainly considering the greater feasibility in a military tribunal of imposing the death penalty.
"People charged with violations of the laws of war are not entitled to the same level of guarantees as civilians charged with crimes," he said, citing Supreme Court rulings that have upheld the tribunals in the past, "as long as the proceedings are fundamentally fair."

The Reasoning
Trails Lead To Middle Easterners
The White House insists that the new emphasis on preventing terrorist attacks has not led to racial profiling -- a practice that has become increasingly discredited in recent years with disclosures that the state police in New Jersey and elsewhere had pulled over disproportionate numbers of black men.
In the weeks since Sept. 11, said Mr. Bartlett, the White House communications director, investigators have simply followed the tips and evidence they had. "The idea was not that we were going to find all visa violators from the Middle East," he said. "That may have been the result."
But some law enforcement officials acknowledge that they have focused extra attention on young men whose last names suggest Middle Eastern origins. Just last month, detectives in New York City's warrants division culled through the police department's computers for people with Middle Eastern names for whom there were outstanding arrest warrants for petty crimes. Nearly 100 people were picked up and questioned about terrorism, an investigator said, with the warrants used to encourage full cooperation.
The federal government has conducted its own, wide-ranging interview program. In recent days, investigators have begun conducting "voluntary" interviews with 5,000 young Middle Eastern men who have entered the United States in the past two years from countries with links to terrorism.
The interviews are voluntary because under the Fourth Amendment, an involuntary detention for questioning might well be a "seizure" requiring justification, at a minimum, on the basis of some reason to suspect a particular individual of a particular crime.
The federal investigators are looking for evidence that they do not yet have, evidence that might shed light on the terrorist network that planned the Sept. 11 attacks or that might still be in the process of planning others.
On more than 200 college campuses federal investigators have contacted administrators to collect information about students from Middle Eastern countries: what they are studying, where they are living, how they are doing. The investigators are also paying unannounced visits on the students themselves, asking anything from their views on Osama bin Laden to their educational plans.
Unlike the actual detention of hundreds of Arab men, these investigatory sweeps have aroused little public controversy or criticism -- with one exception. Some police chiefs, having worked hard to put racial profiling to rest, have said they would not cooperate with the F.B.I. because the sweep appears to violate departmental policy or state or local laws against racial profiling or intelligence gathering for political purposes.
Walter E. Dellinger, acting solicitor general in the Clinton administration, said he had qualms about measures that applied to select groups of people.
"I am more willing to entertain restrictions that affect all of us -- like identity cards and more intrusive X-ray procedures at airports -- and somewhat more skeptical of restrictions that only affect some of us, like those that focus on immigrants or single out people by nationality," he said.
But Mr. Dellinger said infiltration and surveillance were necessary to combat terrorists. "We're going to find it impossible to physically protect every location," he said, "so we have to take significant steps that lead to a new level of intrusion."

 CORRECTION:
A front-page article on Sunday about the potential use of military tribunals and other special methods to investigate and prosecute terrorism misstated the given name of a former deputy solicitor general who supported the use of tribunals. He is Philip Allen Lacovara, not Phillip.

PEOPLE DETAINED AS PART OF INVESTIGATION, CUMULATIVEAccording to the Department of Justice Eight in 10 Americans say they will have to forfeit some of their personal freedoms to make the country safer. New York Times/CBS News Poll 1,147 Detainees reported on Nov. 3. Soon after, the Department of Justice stopped providing the number of people detained in the investigation. OF THOSE STILL BEING HELD ...Material witnesses -- Officials say that about two dozen are believed to have such important information about the terrorists that they are being formally held as material witnesses. Some may testify before a grand jury; some are suspected of having ties to Al Qaeda.Immigration violations -- Some 500 others still are being held on immigration charges.Others -- Many of the remaining detainees have been arrested on local, state or federal charges unrelated to the Sept. 11 attacks. . . . And Actions Taken in Washington Attorney General John Ashcroft and Congressional leaders open talks on an emergency package of anti-terrorism legislation that would expand the ability to use wiretaps. Administration sends to Congress a broad package of anti-terrorism legislation, including a provision that seemingly allows for the indefinite detention of immigrants suspected of terrorism. Gov. Tom Ridge of Pennsylvania chosen to head the Office of Homeland Security. Congress debates provision to detain immigrants indefinitely. Senate aides say the administration has agreed to omit that proposal or significantly modify it. Democrats and Republicans in the House agree on bill to give law enforcement expanded authority to monitor suspected terrorists and share intelligence information. But compromise omits or scales back authority to detain immigrants indefinitely without charges. Bill passes House Judiciary Committee. Senate votes 96 to 1 to approve a bill changing the laws on wiretapping, money laundering and conducting computer surveillance. House, 337 to 79, approves its own anti-terrorism bill. House, with a 412-to-1 vote, requires American banks to assist in effort to fight money laundering by terrorists. House and Senate negotiators hammer out the details of final anti-terrorist legislation. House votes 357 to 66 to adopt the compromise anti-terrorism bill. Senate votes 96 to 1 to adopt the same bill. President Bush signs anti-terrorism bill into law. Ashcroft issues an order to allow federal prison authorities to eavesdrop on attorney-client conversations involving people suspected of posing a direct threat to national security. State Department says it will slow the process for granting visas to young men from Arab and Muslim nations in an effort to prevent terrorist attacks. President Bush signs an order allowing military tribunals to try foreigners charged with terrorism. Justice Department asks law-enforcement authorities across the country to pick up and question 5,000 men, most from the Middle East, who entered the country legally in the last two years. Ashcroft says that the Immigration and Naturalization Service will be split into two bureaus to streamline its border enforcement and service responsibilities.(pg. B4); (pg. B5)

 Gov. Jeb Bush of Florida has described the economics of baseball as bleak. Let us ignore, for the moment, the $252 million salary of merely one of its practitioners and focus on ownership. Only two numbers matter to baseball owners: how much did they pay for the franchise and how much did they sell it for? Recent sales figures have been anything but bleak and pending sales figures are even less so. The bidding for the Boston Red Sox has been reported to reach $400 million. The cost basis is probably something just north of $24 and some barrels of tea.

 Since Sept. 11, New Yorkers have been grumpy, or so psychologists say. Sure, we're trying to carry on with our lives, but we're in horrible moods; at least I am. 
One of the things that especially irks me is that Barry Bonds expects to sign with some team for about $20 million a year for the next five years. While we New Yorkers are mourning thousands of victims, steeling ourselves for a recession, sympathizing with workers who have lost their jobs, and worrying about new terrorist attacks, the thought of paying ballplayers as if nothing has changed makes me sick. 
 No one is a bigger Mets fan than I am. No one cried harder when Hampton and A-Rod rejected Queens. But that was last year. Last year I laughed when people said pitchers shouldn't earn more than police officers and firefighters, laughed when they called our country's priorities messed up. 
Ah, last year. . . .

Is it Clammy in Here?

BYLINE:  By SAM ROBERTS 

 BODY:
GLENDO, Wyo., bought a potato cellar to house all of the town's 294 residents. The Rand Corporation proposed a $150 billion complex of tunnels with 91 convenient entrances into which four million New Yorkers could flee in case of atomic attack. The notion of retreating underground for days or weeks to wait out nuclear war even became the stuff of fiction (remember the sex scene in Robert Henlein's "Farnham's Freehold" and the inevitable hierarchal order of death in Mordecai Roshwald's "Level 7"?). 
 Americans were scared witless by the Soviet threats on Berlin and the Cuban missile crisis, so that by 1965 they had built as many as 200,000 fallout shelters. They came in all shapes and sizes. Cheapskates made do by digging holes and shielding them with old doors. And those willing to spend $5,000 or more could afford to bury family-sized, steel-reinforced cylindrical chambers in their backyards. 
 The government's relentlessly upbeat advice was just as loopy. 
 One 1950 study recommended dropping to the ground in a fetal position for 10 seconds after seeing a sudden flash of light, "after which . . . it is permissible to stand up and look around to see what action appears advisable." Parents, who doled out dog tags to their kids and reinforced the advice of the government-created character Bert the Turtle (he advised children to duck and cover), were reassured that although shelter life could get monotonous, participants in dry runs had survived. "Children," one guidebook advised cheerfully, "were no more restless in shelter than they normally are on long automobile trips." 
 Still, most Americans eventually shunned shelters as elitist and anti-urban, and as posing divisive moral dilemmas. (Should you let your neighbor in, for instance, when there were only enough supplies for your own family?). Robert Moses, the prolific builder of public projects who rarely turned down a development idea, characterized shelter-builders as believing that "abandoning our way of life and crawling into cellars will terrify the enemy and thus prevent war" -- a claim he called stupid. 
 The yellow and black fallout signs survive, but most shelters have been transformed into game rooms and museum pieces. In 1994, one was installed as an exhibit in the National Museum of American History. And a recent Federal Emergency Management Agency handbook suggests shelters as protection against hurricanes and tornadoes, but doesn't mention nuclear war or radioactive fallout -- in part because the immediate threat has evaporated, but also because the practical value of shelters was never proved. 
 Skepticism about bomb-proofing was expressed as early as 1945 by Gen. Leslie R. Groves, who became commander of the Manhattan Project after building the world's largest -- and ostensibly bomb-proof -- office fortress. Witnessing the first test of an atomic weapon, he declared: "I no longer consider the Pentagon a safe shelter from such a bomb."

HEADLINE: The World; 
After the Taliban, Who? Don't Forget North Korea.

BYLINE:  By DAVID E. SANGER 

 BODY:
WITH the Taliban badly battered in Afghanistan, and Osama bin Laden on the run, the biggest parlor game in Washington has now boiled down to one question: What will Phase II of the war look like?
 Theories abound. The Bush administration may not have decided. But one scenario beginning to gain credence goes something like this: In coming months, while it steps up pressure on Al Qaeda's haunts, the United States also gives countries long suspected of hiding their nuclear, chemical or biological weapons programs short deadlines to open up to intensive international inspection. If they refuse, as they have in the past, Washington will quickly raise the pressure, apply sanctions through the United Nations, and vaguely threaten that at some point diplomacy will give way to bombs. 
 Or, as one high-ranking hawk in the Bush administration said Friday, "they might be urged to consult the Taliban" about the risks of stiff-arming Washington.
At the very top of the list would sit Iraq, of course. Conservatives in and out of the administration have been talking about making Saddam Hussein a target almost from the first week of the war. But there is a hint of talk about another secretive, totalitarian nation with a troublesome history of nuclear and germ warfare: North Korea.
For two months, the odd regime in Pyongyang had rarely been mentioned, even though the C.I.A. has long suspected that it has amassed enough nuclear material for two or three atomic weapons. The silence ended last week. John R. Bolton, the under secretary of state for arms control and international security affairs, named Iraq and North Korea as the two nations the United States has concluded are actively developing germ weapons, in violation of a global treaty. He added Iran, Libya and Syria as countries strongly suspected of following suit. "The purpose of naming the names today was to put the international spotlight on them," Mr. Bolton said. "Prior to Sept. 11, some would have avoided this approach. The world has changed, however, and so must our business-as-usual approach."
It would be easy to read too much into Mr. Bolton's statement. Naming names is quite different from demanding inspections and punishing those who play shell games or refuse to open their doors. It could be a feint. "Why not get everyone we dislike on notice?" asked Ashton B. Carter, the Harvard professor who was in the midst of negotiations with the North during the Clinton administration. He said that since Sept. 11, "the North Koreans have been laying as low as they can."
But this is an administration that never put much faith in the Clinton-era negotiations, and stopped such talks dead when it took office. So it was notable that Mr. Bolton said the Bush administration would no longer wait for "slow-moving multilateral mechanisms that are oblivious to what is happening in the real world."
Still, North Korea is an immensely complicated case, and it poses perhaps the most interesting test of how far Mr. Bush is willing to push his war on terrorism and his vow to make sure that weapons of mass destruction do not threaten America or its allies.
North Korea has mixed weapons production and intimidating tests of its medium-range missiles with peace gestures, including negotiations that nearly brought President Clinton to Pyongyang a year ago. President Kim Jong Il abandoned his father's habit of sponsoring terrorism, but he still makes his money by trading in missile technology, notably with America's newest friend, Pakistan. It wants Western aid and trade, but believes its fearsome stockpile of weapons is the only way to hold Washington's attention.
So from the Bush team's first days in Washington, North Korea has divided the administration's "engagement" camp (led by Secretary of State Colin L. Powell) from hard liners who urge that the country must be isolated and, if possible, pushed to the brink of collapse. Mr. Powell lost round one of that debate, and prevailed in round two. Then came Sept. 11, which may change everything.
No one doubts that the North has behaved badly. The 1994 nuclear crisis on the Korean Peninsula was set off by Pyongyong's refusal to allow international inspectors into its huge nuclear reprocessing site at Yongbyon, north of the capital. The Air Force floated a proposal to take out the nuclear facility in an air strike (it insisted that the resulting nuclear contamination would be minimal), but William J. Perry, then the secretary of defense, warned President Clinton that the approach "was highly likely to start a general war."
THEN, just when Mr. Clinton was on the verge of imposing what amounted to an economic embargo on the country, and reinforcing the 40,000 American troops on the Korean Peninsula in case things turned ugly along the DMZ, a partial deal was reached.
Ultimately, North Korea allowed inspectors into Yongbyon, and froze the fuel production from a reactor that the C.I.A. believes had already yielded enough weapons-grade material to produce a few nuclear weapons. (Whether they have been assembled is anyone's guess.) In return, the Western allies agreed to help North Korea build a new generation of "proliferation resistant" nuclear power plants. But construction has proceeded at a dead slow pace, the country is starving, and after 11 months in office the Bush team has yet to hold a serious meeting with North Korean officials.
Now comes the hard part.
Does Mr. Bush try to revive the talks, and with it the Clinton-era offer that North Korea could get itself off the State Department's terrorist list, opening up the possibility of economic aid? Or does he heed conservative advisers who see in North Korea a chance to make an example of a non-Islamic country that poses a threat to two close allies, South Korea and Japan? After all, the intelligence community has a long list of suspect sites it would love to see north of the DMZ.
It's a tough call," said one senior administration official. "There is no link to Al Qaeda," he said, and no evidence of active proliferation of weapons since Sept. 11. South Korea, intent on reviving its own rapprochement with the North, would resist any effort to make its menacing neighbor the next target of the war on terrorism. China and Japan are equally uninterested in creating a crisis. But, the official said, "you can't say you are serious about neutralizing weapons of mass destruction and ignore Kim Jong Il."

HEADLINE: A NATION CHALLENGED: COOPERATION; 
Long at Odds With the U.S., Yemen Is Now Cooperating to Fight Terror

BYLINE:  By RAYMOND BONNER 

DATELINE: SANA, Yemen, Nov. 24 

 BODY:
American intelligence officials and Yemeni authorities, putting aside the diplomatic strains of the last 10 years, including friction over the inquiry into the bombing of the destroyer Cole, have begun to work more closely on tracking terrorists here, Yemeni officials and Western diplomats said this week. 
 "Sept. 11 was a shock, and since then there has been a new cooperation, a genuine one, to combat terrorism," the interior minister, Rashid M. al-Alimi, said in an interview. 
 Acting on information from the Central Intelligence Agency, the Yemeni security police have begun to pick up suspects for interrogation in what the interior minister calls an "ongoing operation." Although authorities here would not be more specific, they said that at least one known member of Al Qaeda, the terrorist network headed by Osama bin Laden, had been among those identified by the C.I.A. and arrested. 
It is hoped the man will provide information to help close down a large Al Qaeda cell that the Yemenis say is still operating in this impoverished country, where Mr. bin Laden's father was born and where Al Qaeda, along with other armed militant Islamic groups, operated with relative impunity during the last decade.
At the same time, the Yemenis have been providing the C.I.A. with phone records and dossiers on suspected terrorists who have been operating from here. The Yemeni government has also begun to cooperate more fully in the investigation of the suicide attack on the Cole, allowing the F.B.I. to interview at least some of the individuals who, until now, had been kept off limits by the Yemeni government, a Western diplomat said this week. The Cole was severely damaged in port in Aden in October 2000, with the loss of 17 American sailors.
American-Yemeni relations have been rocky since the Persian Gulf war, when Yemen did not support the anti-Iraq coalition. But now the Yemeni government, led by President Ali Abdullah Saleh, who is scheduled to begin an official visit to Washington on Tuesday, has made a "fundamental choice," as one Western official here put it, to move closer to the United States, and the West, at least in the war on terrorism. 
It is unclear how far the cooperation will go, diplomats here say. Despite Mr. Saleh's stated commitment to wiping out terrorist organizations, it is by no means certain he can deliver. To some degree he is in their debt because they have helped sustain him in power over the years. Within the Yemeni security services and the military, Mr. bin Laden still has loyal supporters who receive money from him, a senior government official and diplomats said this week. Earlier this month, the Americans gave the Yemenis a list of suspected Al Qaeda members whom they wanted seized. Within 24 hours, at least a dozen had been notified, and had fled the country, said a senior government official. 
During his visit to Washington, Mr. Saleh will hear more "requests and demands" for help on the Cole investigation, a senior Western diplomat here said.
In moving closer to the United States, Mr. Saleh, who has ruled since 1978, will also be bucking a strong anti-American current in this traditional society, where many women still cover themselves from head to toe in black -- by choice, rather than by government decree -- and men carry curved daggers in wide belts. Much of the resentment stems from the United States policy in Israel, officials and ordinary Yemenis said this week.
Secretary of State Colin L. Powell's speech earlier this week on taking steps to resolve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict will go far toward improving America's standing here, a newspaper publisher said.
American economic aid was terminated after the gulf war, except for recent food aid. And while the United States may want to provide economic assistance now, it will have to swallow an unpleasant reality. Corruption here is rampant, and much of the aid goes into officials' pockets. Of every dollar of foreign aid that comes into Yemen, whether from governments or international financial institutions like the World Bank, 40 cents is wasted, a senior Western official said this week. 
To demonstrate their commitment to the war against terrorism, government officials here made themselves available for interviews this week. Among them was the interior minister, who rarely talks to journalists. He agreed to meet near midnight, when a lot of work gets done during Ramadan, the Muslim holy month. 
A former professor of law, Mr. Alimi politely declined to give any specific information about suspected terrorists here, but sought to stress the policies adopted by his government to combat terrorism. 
His government has done even more than the United States has requested, he said. When the Bush administration asked the Yemeni government to freeze the assets of two honey shops, which were said to be sources of income for Al Qaeda, he said the government not only did that but also interrogated the owners of every honey shop in the country. One owner was so incensed that he refused to answer any questions and is still in jail, Mr. Alimi said. He added that the government found no evidence that the honey shops had any links to Mr. bin Laden, not even the two whose assets have been frozen.
Thousands of Arab men who had fought against the Soviet Union in Afghanistan found a welcome here after the war, operating training camps and religious schools. Over the years, pleas from American officials to Yemeni authorities to crack down on the terrorists were largely ignored. Three major Al Qaeda camps were closed down three years ago, but there are still a few smaller ones operating in the country, a security official said this week.
This month, the Yemeni government adopted strict new visa requirements, intended to restrict terrorists. It will no longer be possible to get a visa at the airport, or border crossing, for a modest fee. Now, the interior ministry will run a background check on all visa applicants, Mr. Alimi said. People coming in from countries near Afghanistan, like Pakistan, will be questioned upon their arrival, even if they have a visa.

HEADLINE: The World According To Powell 

BYLINE:  By Bill Keller; Bill Keller is a columnist for The New York Times and a senior writer for the magazine.

 BODY:
The night of Oct. 15 found Colin Powell inside the heavily fortified residence of the American ambassador in Islamabad, dining with his improbable new best friend, the president of Pakistan. Just a few months earlier, when the Bush administration was beginning to compose its tableau of friends and foes, a Powell deputy was sent to court India, a democracy and possible counterweight to China, as America's darling in South Asia. Pakistan was passed over as a terrorist-cradling rogue nation. But war changes everything, and Gen. Pervez Musharraf was now our partner against the terrorists in neighboring Afghanistan. This was Powell's first face-to-face meeting with the Pakistani strongman, and he was impressed with what he found. Like Powell himself, Musharraf was a pragmatic military man, brimming with self-assurance, equally at ease talking tactical soldiery or political strategy, a man given to thinking three or four steps ahead. 
 Powell was in Islamabad to reassure the Pakistanis that the United States would not, as it had in the past, abandon Pakistan once the war was over and to proffer some tangible rewards, including an end to sanctions imposed to punish Pakistan's nuclear testing and help in rescheduling a staggering national debt. This was a gamble for Musharraf, enlisting with America against a viral Islamic hatred incubated, among other places, in Pakistan. The streets were simmering with angry protests. As a precaution against a stray shoulder-fired missile, Powell had ended his 17-hour flight with a lights-out, banking dive into the Islamabad airport. And for security reasons, the dinner was not listed on the schedule handed out to his traveling press entourage. 
 The Secret Service bodyguards were not the only ones feeling twitchy about the visit. Twice, as the two business-suited generals huddled over their meal, cellphones trilled -- first in the pocket of the Pakistani head of intelligence, then in that of the C.I.A. station chief -- with news that India was firing artillery in the disputed border province of Kashmir. Now India was feeling jilted. "It's a way of saying, 'What about us?"' said one member of the Islamabad dinner party.
Such is the volatile, expedient new world of American foreign policy in which Colin Powell presides. And for now at least, he does preside, his comforting charisma, his ally-charming skills and his experience of war all placed at a premium by the terror attacks of Sept. 11.
When I interviewed Powell in a more innocent time, four days before the hijack kamikazes hit the World Trade Center and the Pentagon, I asked him to describe his vision of the world. (Powell has compiled a list of maxims he likes. No. 11 is "Have a vision.") The answer he gave was an articulate and utterly uncontroversial discourse on an America that would lead by the power of its example -- a riff that paid effusive homage to Ronald Reagan's "shining city on a hill." Except for a somewhat heavier foot on the pedal of free markets than you might have heard from a Democratic administration, it was uplifting, nonpartisan boilerplate and seemed to confirm what just about everyone who has worked with Powell says about him, that he is a problem solver, not a visionary.
Six weeks later, when we talked over Diet Cokes on his plane home from his swing through southern Asia, the world had delivered up a whopper of a problem, and he was in his element. Wars, even this "war," relieve you of the quest for a great organizing principle and direct your attention to the practical business of strategy and tactics. And so Powell had been working the world, mustering a coalition of old friends, fair-weather friends and former denizens of the Bush doghouse, amassing real and moral support for a campaign against terror. This time when I asked Powell for the big picture, the issue that demanded his most careful attention in the rearranged world, he plunged into a discussion of the uncertain stability of nuclear-armed Pakistan, a country about as far downhill from Reagan's shining city as you can get.
The campaign against terror has created the kind of crisis-management world in which Powell thrives. Before Sept. 11, Powell was the lonely hope of European allies, Congressional centrists, global business and most of the media commentariat to the left of The Weekly Standard, who viewed him as the adult in a mosh pit of moralists and America-firsters. "In the land of the blind, he's the one-eyed king," said a prominent Democrat shortly before the terror attacks. Since the dawn of a common international cause, though, the Bush administration has been sounding more like Colin Powell than like anyone else. The terrorists have, for now, disarmed the lone-superpower ideologues within the Republican Party and created a sense of global common purpose in which trust among competitive nations seems a little more plausible. The way Powell puts it is that the attack on America "hit the reset button" on foreign policy. Tense American relationships with Russia and China and even in the intractable Middle East, he says, now seem more amenable to breakthroughs. He contends that America has not only moved, at long last, beyond the cold war but has also vaulted past the "post-cold-war period," that confusing interim search for purpose in a world without a center of gravity.
With the rout of the Taliban from Kabul and other cities and, in the same week, halting steps toward a new strategic bargain with Russia, the new Powell doctrine of diplomatic opportunity seems all the more plausible. Whether it survives the frustrations of imposing stability in Afghanistan -- which could mean, among other things, winning a guerrilla war -- or the ultimate test of our allies' competing self-interests remains to be seen. You can find many within the administration and outside it who believe that the Powell view is naive or amoral in a dangerous world. But one man who appears to share Powell's fresh sense of opportunity, who talks about the world with the same tone of bright promise, is President Bush.
On Sept. 11, Powell was sitting down to breakfast in Lima with Alejandro Toledo, the president of Peru, when an aide handed him a note saying that a plane had hit the World Trade Center. "Oh, my God," he said to his host. "Something terrible has happened." It would be 10 hours before he could get through to President Bush, who was being ferried around the country by a nervous Secret Service.
Until that point, the conventional wisdom about Powell was reflected in an end-of-summer Time magazine cover that asked, "Where Have You Gone, Colin Powell?" The new secretary of state had endured a series of minor humiliations -- over North Korea, over the Kyoto Protocol on global warming, over the American peacekeeping commitment in the Balkans. Moreover, he seemed invisible, which in Washington is taken to mean impotent. "We've had our little hiccups," he said a couple of days after that issue of Time appeared. 
Even by then, however, Powell's influence had been steadily growing. He had negotiated a relatively unacrimonious end to the administration's first international crisis, the collision of an EP-3 spy plane with a Chinese fighter, opening the way for a less prickly relationship with China, which President Bush has now embraced. He had reassured the Europeans that despite the Bush camp's belittling talk of nation-building in Bosnia and Kosovo, the Americans who went in with the allies would not leave without them. Bush had, almost impetuously, abandoned his campaign suspicion of Russia. And despite the administration's scorn for Bill Clinton's personal diplomacy in the Middle East, the president had agreed in a National Security Council meeting, the conclusions of which were later artfully leaked, to reaffirm American support for Palestinian statehood and authorize a more active American role in the region. In all of this, the president was following the instincts of his secretary of state.
By Friday, Sept. 14, when Powell helicoptered to Camp David for dinner with Vice President Cheney, Defense Secretary Rumsfeld and Condoleezza Rice, the national security adviser, crucial preparations for war were already under way. Powell's most trusted deputy, Richard Armitage, had already called in the Pakistani intelligence chief to lay the foundations of a military squeeze on Afghanistan. Armitage, a Vietnam vet with a bodybuilder's imposing bulk, was once decorated by the government of Pakistan for helping arm Afghan rebels in their insurgency against Soviet control. Now he delivered a seven-point, with-us-or-against-us ultimatum calling on the Pakistanis to close their border with Afghanistan, open their intelligence files and provide access for American forces. The Pakistani diplomat left and returned the next day with Musharraf's unqualified concurrence, and Powell cinched it in a phone call to the Pakistani leader. The bombing was still three weeks away, but the group that gathered at Camp David quickly came to the conclusion that the American response would be military and that it would be careful and methodical.
"There is always the pressure to go back and smack somebody right away," Powell, who likes to quote Thucydides on the military virtue of restraint, told me the following week. But, Powell went on to say, the question was "who that somebody was, one, and how to do it so that you were hitting that someone or some group and not just hitting for the sake of hitting."
Over dinner, the foursome kept the conversation light, but the next morning they were joined by the president, George Tenet, the C.I.A. director, and an array of deputies in a Camp David conference room. For four hours they turned over the options, the risks, how to make the declared war more than a figure of speech. They ran through the Soviet experience in Afghanistan, the genesis of the Taliban, the question of how far to trust Pakistan. They talked about whether the initial phase of the war should extend beyond Al Qaeda to target terrorist groups with popular backing in the Middle East, like Hamas and Hezbollah, and whether it should encompass sponsoring states -- Syria, Iran and especially Iraq.
"What was kicked around at Camp David was, You have a lot of other countries in the world that support terrorism," said one participant. "What are we going to do about them? Obviously there's Al Qaeda and there's Afghanistan, but we don't want to send a message that there's good terrorism and bad terrorism. You know, you can't be against Al Qaeda and then support Hezbollah."
Powell pointed out that there was no evidence connecting Iraq to the Sept. 11 attacks. Others said that that was irrelevant, that the administration came to power promising to do more to bring about an end to Saddam Hussein. Powell said the coalition would not hold if the United States targeted Iraq, and without the coalition there could be no shutting off of terrorist finances, no intelligence sharing, no international arrests.
After a lunch break, when Bush asked the cabinet principals to sum up their views of the discussion, there was general agreement that Afghanistan and Al Qaeda would be plenty for the first stage. The next day, back at the White House, the president called in Rice and said that he had made up his mind. Iraq was left for the future.
"Iraq will be sitting there after this campaign is well along," Powell told me a few days later. "Iraq isn't going anywhere. It's in a fairly weakened state. It's doing some things we don't like. We'll continue to contain it. But there really was no need at this point, unless there was really quite a smoking gun, to put Iraq at the top of the list.
"With respect to what is sometimes characterized as taking out Saddam," he added, "I never saw a plan that was going to take him out. It was just some ideas coming from various quarters about, Let's go bomb." He said raining bombs on Iraq would be no more effective now than it was when President Clinton did it in December 1998. "What was the result of the bombing? He's still there, except you put him back on Page 1. 'Here I am!' And you've spent a billion dollars. So, we'll take that in stride, in sequence. He'll be there, unfortunately, a week, a month, two months from now."
For Powell's Republican critics inside and outside the administration, Iraq remains the nagging test of whether this war should or will be fought on his terms, and it is a battle postponed rather than resolved. When and if President Bush becomes convinced that he should attack Iraq, Powell will hew loyally to the policy, but so far he doesn't see the point.
On the plane back from Asia last month, I asked if he had seen anything to change his mind about targeting Iraq. He said he had not. 
I asked about the mission that James Woolsey, the former director of central intelligence, had recently undertaken to gather evidence of an Iraqi role in the twin towers attack. Powell was clearly irritated. Woolsey "wasn't working for me," he said. "All I know is what I read in the newspapers. And I assume he's doing something for the Pentagon." 
Powell's most vociferous critics trace his reluctance to go after Iraq now to his role in the gulf war, when he was chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. It is, they contend, a continuation of an earlier mistake that Powell refuses to admit.
It is true that the advice Powell gave the first President Bush after Iraq invaded Kuwait was consistently cautious. As documented by Michael R. Gordon and Gen. Bernard E. Trainor in their meticulous account of the war, "The Generals' War: The Inside Story of the Conflict in the Gulf," Powell opposed using ship movements to send Saddam a signal of American resolve, a reluctance some say emboldened the Iraqi leader to move against Kuwait. (The man who advocated moving ships toward the Persian Gulf to deter an invasion was Paul Wolfowitz, then under secretary of defense.) Powell advocated a longer period of economic and political sanctions before sending troops. He at first wanted the focus to be on defending Saudi Arabia rather than on liberating Kuwait. Based on what proved to be overgenerous Pentagon estimates of Iraqi strength, he insisted that the war could be undertaken only with half a million troops. And in the end, after the Iraqi Army had fled home, he recommended ending the war after five days, although (as intelligence would later show) half of Saddam's lethal Republican Guard had escaped with its tanks back into Iraq, where they would help crush Shiite and Kurdish uprisings and assure Saddam's hold on power. Powell feared that bombarding the retreating Iraqis along the so-called Highway of Death would make America seem brutal, and President Bush agreed.
This record persuades conservatives that Powell was too fainthearted. William Kristol, editor of the conservative Weekly Standard, wrote in late September in The Washington Post that the first President Bush went to war against Iraq over the resistance of Powell, and he challenged the current president to do likewise.
I put this complaint to former President Bush, who sent back a furious written reply.
"Kristol said Powell opposed the use of force," he wrote. "That is a vicious slander, totally untrue. I valued Colin's opinion that when force was needed we'd use sufficient force to keep our casualties to a bare minimum. . . . That Colin did not want to use force is a grossly unfair, insupportable lie."
As for the contention that Powell persuaded the president to stop short of neutering Saddam Hussein, the former president wrote: "Our mission was to end the aggression and kick Saddam out of Kuwait. My commanders told me, 'Mission accomplished.' I ended the fighting. For the reasons I have often stated, I have no regrets that we avoided changing the mission. I admit that based upon the opinion of all our coalition partners I did feel Saddam would flee Iraq or be killed given the magnitude of his defeat. All of us underestimated Saddam's cruelty and brutality to his own people, which keeps him in office."
Powell himself concedes a little bit of ground. "You can reasonably argue that we should have gone for another day or two," he told me. "We would have destroyed more tanks, we would have killed more people, we would have lost more lives, there would have been more destruction along the Highway of Death. But we weren't going to Baghdad. And so when you read things, as I read in an article not too long ago, that Powell insisted on keeping Saddam Hussein in place in Baghdad, that gets my dander up. It's like I'm some Rasputin figure that was all alone causing all this to happen or not to happen." 
Administration officials will tell you that the philosophical differences between Powell and his colleagues are exaggerated. One White House official scoffed at what he called the MTV "Celebrity Death Match" version of policy-making that comes across in news accounts. Rice, whose job is to protect against internecine conflict, insists, "It's actually a very collegial national security team, and it's rare that we even go to the president with some split decisions." It is true that since Sept. 11, differences have been muted, and with the National Security Council meeting often and the cabinet principals gathering every evening, Bush's advisers seem to have grown quite comfortable with one another.
But while the division has been bridged for now, relegated to the sniping of deputies and surrogates in the press, it is a real fault line that runs through the administration, and it could open again.
On one side is a neoconservative school that flowered in President Reagan's first term, before he fell in love with arms control. Those in this group tend to see the world in darker tones. They are suspicious of treaties and alliances that constrain American power and generally unsentimental about humanitarian interventions where explicit American interests are not at stake. But they harbor a pronounced sense of America's moral obligations, reflected most powerfully in a devotion to beleaguered democracies like Israel and Taiwan (and for some of them during previous administrations, Bosnia). This group includes Defense Secretary Rumsfeld and his deputy, Paul Wolfowitz -- who half-joked around the time he accepted the job that the reason he enlisted in the new administration was to keep an eye on Powell -- and a number of outside advisers they have assembled at the Pentagon. The group includes Vice President Cheney, who has been an important sponsor of Powell but who as defense secretary during the gulf war sometimes jousted with Powell over what he saw as the general's foot-dragging. Rice, while she has settled rather successfully into the national security adviser role of honest policy broker, is at heart more impatient with make-nice diplomacy than Powell.
The second group reflects a more traditional Republican foreign policy of the kind that prevailed under the first President Bush -- comfortable with alliances, treaties and international institutions, less assertive in the promotion of American values abroad, more Realpolitik in its judgments, more "sandpapered" in its language, as one aide put it. Powell is the standard-bearer for this camp, which includes most of the upper ranks of the State Department and some sympathizers in the White House, along with an outside chorus that notably includes the president's father.
Since Sept. 11, any frictions have tended to occur at the margins of policy, and they have been played out through deputies putting their spin into briefing papers and whispering to sympathizers in the press. Powell says that the cabinet is "in full accord" on the conduct of the antiterror campaign. He is particularly sensitive about any suggestion that he imposes himself in the Pentagon's business; aides say that he confines his advice to occasions when the president or vice president ask for it. Powell slapped down as "absolute nonsense" reports by Rumsfeld sympathizers in the press that he had dictated a go-slow approach to the early bombing in Afghanistan. "I know enough not to do something I used to do for a living when there's somebody else better qualified than me to now do it," he told me last week. 
Powell himself has not spent all those years in the executive branch without becoming adept at close bureaucratic combat. His in-fighting style is patient and discreet. He gives his interviews on the record, so he cannot be accused of badmouthing rivals, except implicitly. (Asked about reports of some jostling with Rice for influence, Powell firmly denied it, then added that he regarded the national security adviser "like a daughter," which was probably not meant to sound condescending but left no doubt about who was the alpha dog.) Powell has plenty of loyalists in the government and Congress who are willing to get more personal. A recent flurry of press reports that characterized Wolfowitz, the Pentagon deputy, as a right-wing zealot -- shrewdly not aiming at Rumsfeld himself -- was helped along by Powell supporters in the administration and on Capitol Hill.
Powell is careful not to undercut a presidential decision, but he is willing to put forward spin on a policy before the president has formally staked a position. When the first Bush administration was wrestling with the question of whether to intervene in Bosnia, Powell gave an impassioned interview to this newspaper on the folly of intervention, which those who favored air strikes viewed as bordering on insubordination. Last month in Shanghai, he gave a speech to business leaders that was, by several degrees, more optimistic about the benign direction of China's leadership than President Bush has been.
Those who have worked with him say that Powell is usually the best-prepared person in any meeting and has anticipated the arguments several steps out. He can draw on experience of every war since Vietnam. There are seven seats on the National Security Council, including the president and vice president; Powell has held three of them.
"He's a smart linear thinker, with iron self-control, tremendous pride and self-confidence, great leadership skills, great presentational skills, limited analytical skills and a commanding presence," said a diplomat who has sparred with Powell. "It's an amazing package."
Plus, there is the aura. The decorated warrior. The intimate of, now, four presidents. The man many felt could become the first African-American president. His story of accomplishment is the subject of more than 20 books, including his own best-selling memoir. None of this is likely to awe men of comparable experience, like Cheney and Rumsfeld, but it cannot fail to impress a president with none of those credentials.
At some level, generally obscured by Powell's competence and charm, the fact that he is black contributes something to the chemistry. There is the crude fact that a popular black war hero is politically invincible in a Republican administration that won without a majority. And there is a more subtle sense that his achievements make white Americans feel a little better about themselves, and a bit more open to Powell.
Those who work with him tend to shy away from the subject of his race, but Powell has thought about it a good deal. He has said that his descent from blacks of the West Indies, where slavery ended earlier than in the United States and where the mixing of African and European bloodlines was more common, gave his people a greater self-assurance than descendants of American slaves. That was reinforced in the comparatively meritocratic world of the Army. He is light-skinned, with the ethnically neutral voice of a television anchor and an inviting face, which the writer Henry Louis Gates Jr. described as having "a sort of yearbook openness." This makes him an easy man to be around. As he told Gates in a remarkably candid series of interviews for The New Yorker: "One, I don't shove it in their face, you know? I don't bring any stereotypes or threatening visage to their presence. Some black people do. Two, I can overcome any stereotypes or reservations they have, because I perform well. Third thing is, I ain't that black." 
Rice, who as a black woman may know even more than Powell about the sting of stereotypes, said that the one time "others tried to energize" the issue of race against Powell was when the administration chose to spurn the United Nations conference on racism in South Africa. Articles appeared speculating that Powell, who has a fascination with Africa, wanted to go. In fact, Rice said, the president left the decision to Powell, who saw the conference dissolving into an Israel-bashing session and chose not to attend. Both Powell and Rice were said to be disturbed by the significance race took on in the matter. 
"Still got your voice, Andrea?"
A dozen reporters dragged themselves onto the State Department plane home from Shanghai to find Powell presiding over the press seats, tending his entourage. Andrea Koppel, the ailing CNN correspondent, nodded that she was still fit to file.
"That's too bad," Powell said, smiling, and ducked forward into his cabin. He would be back after a few hours' sleep, changed into his traveling uniform of crisp white T-shirt and blue-and-green windbreaker, for a stand-up briefing that would range from the details of China's nuclear deterrent to developments in Israel, managing the seasoned briefer's trick of breaking no news while not sounding canned.
For a man who decided, after a long and public introspection in 1995, that he did not have the stomach for campaign politics, Powell is nimble at the parts of his job that resemble campaign politics -- the flattering wisecrack, the command of detail, the much-repeated answer that sounds fresh and the ability to be alert when everyone else is fall-down tired.
All of this has served him during the accelerated diplomacy of assembling a war coalition, which is a little like playing chess on 20 boards at once against challengers with wildly differing opening gambits. There are the Europeans, who came to the antiterror campaign as volunteers and require consulting but no persuading. One thing the Europeans want from Powell, though, is assurance that the United States is doing what it can to defuse the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and Powell calls regularly with reports on his conversations with Prime Minister Sharon, Foreign Minister Peres and Yasir Arafat. He does the same with Saudi Arabia, one of the few countries where Powell's contacts from the gulf war are still in power. Japan is another story. The Japanese are being courted to help in the reconstruction of Afghanistan after the war, but they also want to be talked to about the military aspects because they see themselves emerging as more than just a one-dimensional economic power. Powell obliges. 
He has met the Russian foreign minister, Igor Ivanov, 13 times and speaks with him routinely to discuss counterterrorism and the full menu of issues. More delicately, using his policy-planning deputy, Richard N. Haass, and working through multilateral committees, Powell has tried to draw Iran into the antiterrorism effort. The Iranians have been helpful in the distribution of food to refugees and have agreed to provide search-and-rescue help if American war planes run into serious trouble in Afghanistan. The United States wants them to use their influence to help assemble a broad alternative government in Afghanistan.
To support him in all of this, Powell has brought back to life a neglected and demoralized instrument: the State Department. Under previous administrations, the State Department has watched its power be siphoned off to political operatives in the White House and places like the Treasury Department, its network of trained diplomats eroded, its facilities starved and mismanaged. From Powell's first day at the State Department, his reliance on the career Foreign Service has been a rejuvenating tonic to an institution that had felt marginalized. Powell has filled many of his key assistant-secretary jobs, the people who oversee the six regions of the globe, with career Foreign Service officers, to whom he has delegated the kind of authority a general gives to his division commanders. Whether by design or not (Powell's people insist not), this has had the additional effect of assuring that those jobs would not go to White House political appointees whose views were to the right of his own. 
The business of management rarely engages secretaries of state, but it is an obsession in the modern American military -- developing and motivating talent, delegating authority while holding subordinates to account, dispensing praise and trust in exchange for loyalty and hard work, tending to morale. One retired general who worked closely with Powell recalled his arrival as chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. He inherited a "Joint Staff" of two-star and three-star generals assigned by -- and loyal to -- the individual services. They reported to him through a tightknit outfit called the Chairman's Staff Group, which filtered and homogenized the conflicting advice of Air Force and Army. His first day on the job, Powell called in the Staff Group and said: "Here's the drill: You're out of it." Thereafter, he took his information directly from the bright officers assigned by the services, bolstering their loyalty to him and assuring a flow of unvarnished information.
State Department insiders say that Powell operates much the same way with dissenters inside his department. A notable example is John Bolton, the under secretary of state for arms control and international security, who is an ardent hawk whose appointment Cheney lobbied for. Rather than isolate Bolton, whose views on Russia and arms treaties are considerably to the right of his own, Powell uses the under secretary to test and sharpen his own thinking.
"Washington players can be divided into those who know how to work the institution and those who don't," said the retired general. "Madeleine Albright didn't. Rumsfeld, in his first months, didn't. Powell plays the institution like a damn orchestra."
The restoration of the State Department has, of course, only elevated the alarm of hawks, who see the career Foreign Service as a bastion of overpolite cookie-pushers and status-quo pragmatists.
For all his towering reputation and managerial gifts, Powell started in his job with two serious operational handicaps. He was not an intimate of the new president, and he was viewed with mistrust by the unilateralists who seemed to have custody of the unschooled president's worldview.
New presidencies often start out as extensions of the campaign war room, driven by the glib convictions of the debate briefing book and powered by the loyalties tested in the heat of political combat. Compared, for example, with Condoleezza Rice, who had been the candidate's foreign-policy tutor and spent her weekends grafted to the president's side, or to Dick Cheney, Powell had not really been there. Powell spent the campaign year giving speeches at $75,000 apiece, promoting his program for poor kids, America's Promise, and savoring a life beyond his official duties -- a wife he reveres, a hobbyist's devotion to tinkering with old Volvos, a reading list that extends beyond the daily intelligence digest. His most conspicuous role in the Bush campaign had been a speech at the Republican convention in Philadelphia, in which he scolded the party for being insensitive to the condition of minorities. The speech played well at a gathering designed as a showcase of inclusiveness, but it compounded the doubts of party zealots that Powell was a Republican in his soul.
Powell's son, Michael, a free-market Republican who is chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, said his liberal friends find it hard to believe that his father, an African-American centrist who supports affirmative 
action and abortion rights, could feel at home in the Republican Party. "They say, 'He's not really one of you, right?"' And a fair number of Republicans undoubtedly feel the same way, that he's not really "one of us."
"For the bulk of his career he did the kind of things that are relatively politically agnostic," said Michael, whose own Army career was cut short by a near-fatal car crash. "Even when there was contemplation he'd run for president, the biggest speculation was, As what? I mean, what greater accolade to a soldier than, You don't even know his politics?"
For Powell, membership in the Republican Party is less a matter of theology than of style and loyalty to the political mentors who promoted him, beginning in the Reagan administration. He likes the discipline, the respect for authority and tradition -- and, of course, the party's support of the military -- more than the conservative social agenda, the chest-beating unilateral streak or the distaste for government. "What we both are, is moderates," his son said.
Powell's temperance in affairs of state matches an instinctive caution honed in a meteoric military career that depended heavily on the patronage of admiring, mostly Republican, civilians. He has never been a boat-rocker, although along the way he has occupied some boats that wanted rocking. As military assistant to Reagan's defense secretary, Caspar Weinberger, for example, he acquiesced in a White House scheme to sell missiles to Iran in the hope of liberating American hostages; his conduct brought him a mild rebuke from the independent counsel -- and a promotion. His old mentor Weinberger sums up Powell this way: "Colin is quintessentially a good soldier. He does his duty and carries out orders."
Like many soldiers of his generation, Powell took from Vietnam, along with two wounds and a chestful of decorations, a disillusioning lesson in the politics of war, a determination not to agree to what he called "halfhearted warfare for half-baked reasons." In 1984, when he was Weinberger's military aide, he was impressed by a speech the defense secretary gave articulating a series of tests a commander in chief should apply before using military force. During the Balkan conflict, when Powell was chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, a reporter for this newspaper compiled these guidelines and labeled them the "Powell Doctrine." In brief, it calls for the use of force to be clearly synchronized with political ends and for force to be applied decisively. (Powell has used the word "overwhelming," though he now disavows it.) The doctrine does not specify that wars should be quick, low-casualty and popular, but it certainly smiles on such wars. Powell says that he has always regarded his rules as guidelines, not dogma -- a safeguard against wars, like Vietnam, that demoralize the country and damage American prestige. He argues that the people he calls "Kmart parents" -- working-class Americans who tend to be the parents of soldiers -- should understand why their children are being put at risk and should never doubt that the country will back them to the hilt.
His rules for the application of force have been maligned by more interventionist critics, liberal and conservative, as an excuse for inaction.
"He is exceedingly cautious," said an official who, like everyone with aspirations of influence, refused to criticize Powell for the record. "Cautious to the point where he will reject audacious options, even well-considered ones." When asked about this, Powell retorted: "Caution is not a vice. I think it's a virtue. I know when to act. And if caution is such a terrible vice, then I'm sure the various people I've worked for over the years probably would not have hired me."
The most controversial application of the Powell Doctrine was in Bosnia, where Powell's aversion to committing American force was outspoken and adamant, verging on coldhearted. Powell worried at each step that ostensibly limited American involvement -- airdrops of food and medicine for Bosnian Muslims, air strikes against Serbs -- would lead inexorably to a deep and bloody American involvement. He seemed to sense something ordained by history in the war of Muslims and Serbs. He approvingly quoted Bismarck's remark that all the Balkans were not worth the life of one of his soldiers.
Powell's reluctance matched the sentiment in the first Bush White House, where President Bush was running a difficult re-election campaign against a public sense that he was too preoccupied with foreign policy. Powell still had eight months to serve as chairman when President Clinton came to office, fresh from a campaign in which he excoriated Bush for sitting by while Serbs slaughtered Muslims in Bosnia. But the new president's attention was on health care and the economy, and his national security team was haunted by ghosts of the Vietnam entanglement. Madeleine Albright, then the ambassador to the United Nations, and James Woolsey, the C.I.A. director, argued for intervention, but they were outnumbered, and overshadowed by the impressive figure of Powell.
There is a famous encounter between Powell and the Clintonites that gets recounted with different emphasis depending on who is doing the telling. The president's foreign policy advisers were agonizing over Bosnia, Powell arguing as usual that only a large ground force could change the behavior of the Serbs and that it was hard to envision a political goal for which the public would support the risk of American lives.
Those who favored intervention recount with relish Albright's outburst: "What's the point of having this superb military that you're always talking about if we can't use it?"
Supporters of Powell are more likely to recall his reaction, unvoiced but noted in his autobiography: "I thought I would have an aneurysm. American G.I.'s were not toy soldiers to be moved around on some sort of global game board."
But the revealing contribution came from Anthony Lake, the national security adviser, reflecting the disposition of an administration cowed by history: "You know, Madeleine, the kinds of questions Colin is asking about goals are exactly the ones the military never asked during Vietnam."
Powell left the government at the end of September 1993, but he continued to argue that Bosnia was "baffling," insoluble and in any case not worth the risk of American lives. Although Bosnia today is, by virtue of NATO intervention, at peace, Powell says that he has no regrets about opposing military involvement.
President Clinton declined to be interviewed for this article, and several officials in his administration would not be quoted by name on the subject, but there is a lingering bitterness that Powell is not held more accountable for the Clinton administration's retreat from its campaign promises on Bosnia.
Clinton has also long fumed that Powell did not share the blame for the fiasco of Somalia, where 18 American commandos were killed in a misguided mission in 1993. Powell had reluctantly advised Clinton to order in commandos to help hunt down a warlord bedeviling an American-led humanitarian effort. Their deaths and desecration became a paralyzing symbol of the folly of well-intentioned foreign entanglements.
The angriest I have seen Powell was when I broached the subject of Somalia as we flew back from Asia. He surged forward in his seat, and I thought of what Michael Powell had told me about growing up with his father: "I don't think I have any memory of ever being spanked or hit, but he could scare the bejesus out of you. He just had to be mad. It was enough."
"I know what he says," Powell snapped, referring to Clinton, and then he began a smoldering account of how the situation in Somalia, almost inevitably, unraveled. The details of the sad climax are arguable, but they are peripheral compared with the bigger blunder, which was not Powell's doing: allowing an effort to feed starving Somalis to evolve into a campaign to introduce democracy where there was nothing but clan warfare.
As Powell is well aware, the war on terrorism strains his ideal of clear objectives and decisive commitments. The war is unconventional and likely to become more so as the Taliban retreat into the mountains. The broader declared purpose of making the world inhospitable for terrorists is murky and open-ended. But as one administration official put it: "If you deconstruct the so-called doctrine into a set of questions, they are still important questions, and they're the questions Powell will keep asking: What, exactly, is the objective? Have we brought the right resources to bear? What happens next?"
That Powell now seems to be in tune with the president should not be so surprising. Apart from his more ideologically ardent handlers, Bush has always seemed to have an essentially optimistic temperament and an instinctive trust in personal relationships and in the ability of reasonable people to work things out. The issue on which Powell has worked hardest to close a gulf between himself and the president is Bush's apparently devout belief in missile defense. Before the antiterror campaign, the issue of missile defense was the single most important test of how the Bush administration would balance the new primacy of unfettered American self-interest against a pragmatic respect for the rest of the civilized world. The intramural debate on that issue continues, and it is as good a window as you can find into how Powell thinks and how he operates. 
In the months of deliberations leading up to Vladimir Putin's inconclusive visit to the president's ranch in Crawford, Tex., Powell was the most forceful voice for a compromise on missile defense that would allow American testing to proceed without demolishing the scaffolding of arms-control agreements. Like many career soldiers, Powell has always been a skeptic about wizard weapons that promise to make warfare antiseptic, simple and safe. He likes his advances in military technology incremental and tested. In his view, civilian leaders who put their faith in smart bombs and high-altitude air power usually end up sending divisions of soldiers to die finishing the job.
Powell's suspicion of missile defense was nourished at its genesis, President Reagan's Strategic Defense Initiative, which the young Pentagon aide watched with a kind of amused horror.
"Reagan, God bless him, was forever talking about this shield and, you know, We're just going to make all offensive weapons useless," Powell recalled, rolling his eyes. Powell saw antimissile technology at the time not as a utopian dream but as a useful way of throwing a scare into the war planners of the Soviet Union. Once U.S. negotiators had placed missile defense on a back burner as part of a deal cutting nuclear arsenals on both sides, Powell was happy to let it revert to a low-priority research project.
Fifteen years later, Powell says that the technology is more plausible and well worth advanced testing. What he has in mind is not a missile-tight umbrella of defenses in space, but sea-based rockets that might intercept a nuclear missile soon after launch and installations on American territory that might stop a missile as it descends. Powell invariably refers to "limited" missile defense, a phrase the president has now adopted. Powell is wary, though, of making missile defense the tail that wags the dog of foreign policy.
"One can argue whether you should give it this amount of attention, this amount of passion, and give it the foremost position on your agenda," Powell told me in September. If the United States can calculate a way around the A.B.M. treaty, which prohibits advanced testing, then "it's just another defense program that will go into a more routine level of development without the kind of attention it's now getting."
The argument within the administration has focused on exactly how to get around the A.B.M. treaty constraints. Rice and others at the Pentagon and in the White House wanted to drop the A.B.M. treaty altogether as a demonstration that America accepts no artificial limits on its national interest. They have argued that amending the treaty would entail a time-consuming ratification battle in the Senate and that even something less than a formal amendment -- a Russian side letter promising not to challenge certain tests -- would give the Russians too much leverage.
Powell's first preference is for an amendment to the treaty, which would assure the full blessing of Congress and avoid controversy he said the president didn't need. Failing that, he said he would be content with a less-formal understanding that certain specific tests were O.K. -- an agreement the Russians have so far balked at providing. The important thing, he said, was to avoid abandoning the treaty altogether, with the probable high price in Russian, European and Congressional good will. He argued that a concession to the Russians on the formalities of the A.B.M. treaty would be more than repaid in other ways -- their acquiescence in the expansion of NATO, the continued reform of their economy and, of course, their cooperation in the war against terror.
Powell is sympathetic to their anxieties.
"The one thing that scares them -- and I'd be scared if I were them, and we've got to figure out a way to deal with this: 'Powell, we love you like a brother. We don't care what the magazines in Washington say, we think you're great. But you'll be gone one day. Putin will be gone. Bush will be gone. Igor will be gone. And we will have made some kind of a deal now, and, great, it's a limited defense. Well, one day another president comes in, and he decides: "I'll replicate it. I'll clone it. I'll geneticize it." And it goes from being a limited defense to: POW! Reagan's back. How do you persuade us that's not going to happen? We can't do this on the basis of personal relations. It has to be on the basis of our national interest over time."' Which means, Powell said, "You codify it somehow.
"A good argument you get on the other side, probably from Condi, is: 'Let's just do what we think is right. We really don't have to be bound up in the legal documents like we used to be with the Soviet Union.' We will see."
Powell paused and pursed his lips in a grim smile.
Referring to the Russians, he said: "You could just say, 'The heck with you.' I would rather not."
Won't the Russians get over it if we decide to go it alone? 
"They may get over it," he replied. "But they also will be under no constraints as to what they might do in the future." 
Given Powell's stature -- Senator John McCain calls him "the most popular person in America" -- and the uncertain state of the vice president's health, there's considerable curiosity about whether Powell would ever revisit the question of higher office. What if, for example, Cheney's heart troubles were to recur and President Bush invited Powell to become vice president -- meaning a campaign role in 2004 and considerable pressure to run for president in 2008, when he would be 71?
I asked this question of everyone I interviewed who was close to Powell, and the reaction was almost universally dismissive. The attacks of Sept. 11 have certainly not diminished the powerful fears of his wife, Alma, that as a candidate Powell would be a target for every kind of madman. And Powell seems to have come to terms with his own visceral reluctance.
"Absolutely not," said Richard Armitage, probably Powell's closest friend in government. "He's slept soundly from the time he made the decision on it. He said at the time: 'On mornings when I woke up and thought, I'm going to run, I felt terrible, it was a terrible day. On mornings I got up and said, I'm not going to, I had a wonderful day. And I finally came to realize, with all these people telling me, You have to run, they were looking for a shortcut, they wanted someone on a white horse. That's not the way our system works."'
Powell's son, Michael, said it was "very, very doubtful" that his father would revisit the question, having "resolved it in a pretty fundamental way."
"But, and I guess this is an important but, he does have a sort of consummate commitment and love of service and serving the country," he continued. "In the extreme, if the country was at war, if there were the kind of challenges with which he could come to grips, if there was some reason he was the right person for the right time -- I do think it would have to be some element that rose to that level in his mind to entice him to do it." That was the week before we declared ourselves at war. 
If Powell wants a larger job, though, he need only stay put. Because now, with the rapid advances of anti-Taliban forces in Afghanistan, it gets really complicated. 
In a phone conversation last week, with the Taliban collapsing, Powell cited his own scripture: "By Powell Doctrine standards, you keep your eye on the political objective, which is Osama bin Laden and the Al Qaeda network."
But among the things Powell has committed America's diplomats to do, even before the military work is fully accomplished: help assemble a Muslim-led peacekeeping force in Afghanistan and then a reasonably stable, polyglot government without precedent; repay and reassure the government of Pakistan; try to defuse the explosive border dispute in Kashmir; and calculate a new relationship with the highly problematic government of Iran. He also appears set to inject himself, and possibly President Bush, in the cynics' nest of what America now freely calls Palestine. Powell will probably be spending a lot more time with yet another longtime coddler of terrorists, Yasir Arafat, and with yet another problematic general, Ariel Sharon. 
And the minute the Afghan phase of the war on terror seems near an end, he may again have his hands full maintaining that other troublesome coalition, the Bush administration.

An Expert in the Neglected History of Food

BYLINE:  By MARCELLE S. FISCHLER

 BODY:
STANDING by the open fire, Alice Ross stirred the pot of chicken and dumpling stew. With a hook, she lifted the lid on a Dutch oven to check on her ginger cake, then rustled the glowing embers on the lid to add a little more heat. On the far edge of the crackling fire, potato croquettes sizzled in a pan of lard.
 Ms. Ross was not on a camping trip. Setting kettles and pots on an open hearth and whipping up vats of homemade tomato relish based on recipes from early Long Island church fund-raising cookbooks is her culinary forte. 
 "For me, cooking is a way of understanding the social history of a time, of a place, of a particular group," Ms. Ross said, ticking off the relish ingredients: sweet red pepper, tomatoes, onion and celery cooked two to three hours with vinegar, sugar, cloves, allspice and ginger. 
Ms. Ross is Long Island's only Ph.D. food historian. To earn her doctorate at the State University of New York at Stony Brook in 1996, she studied the foods of Suffolk County and the role women played in food in the days when fishing and farming, not McDonalds, provided sustenance.
"It all gets tied into their lifestyle, their ethnicity, their religion, economics, all the things that feed into the way people's cultures evolved," said Ms. Ross, recalling that the thesis committee snickered when she proposed culling old recipes when she started her research 20 years ago.
At the Fall Festival at Deepwells Farms in St. James recently, Ms. Ross was preparing the foods of its former owner, William J. Gaynor, a farmer and the mayor of New York from 1910 to 1913. He grew potatoes and kept prize chickens on his 60-acre spread.
"They were mainly for laying eggs," said Ms. Ross, regretting she hadn't been allowed to slaughter the birds but had to buy the chickens at the supermarket. "At this time of year you would butcher the chickens which aren't going to produce a lot of eggs for you anymore. They are old, tough birds and they have fabulous flavor, not like the young ones that we broil or fry. You kept the good laying hens to provide you with eggs for next year's flock."
The chickens in the soup pot bubbled. Ms. Ross sampled the brew. "They have the best flavor but they take a long cooking time," Ms. Ross said, patting flour, baking powder and salt and wetting them with milk to roll into dumplings. She apologized for a major gaffe in authenticity since it wasn't possible to get a wood stove for the two-day event. 
But in the converted carriage house behind Ms. Ross's 1885 Victorian in Smithtown, Ms. Ross tries to be historically correct. The food scholar gives Victorian cooking lessons on a wood stove. Hobbyists, curators, graduate students and teachers learn to make kettle chowder and Dutch-oven cornbread in her 10-foot colonial brick hearth. 
"Novelists will come and do a day of cooking around their subjects so that when they write the details into their novels, they get them right, so they understand how it felt, how it worked, how it tasted," Ms. Ross said. "A substantial effort is made to help people do a little time travel and adjust to a different way of handling technology. The hardest thing is to manage the heat. You don't just set an oven and walk away."
Among Ms. Ross's extensive collection of antique pots, pans and utensils is an assortment of toasters for browning bread on an open flame, a Victorian pancake maker, a noodle cutter and working water pump. 
(To prepare her own gourmet meals, Ms. Ross doesn't hesitate to use modern appliances. She has two sinks, a restaurant stove, a huge commercial refrigerator and freezer, a commercial 20-quart mixer and a brand-new extra-deep stainless steel sink in her inside kitchen.)
Ms. Ross, 71, grew up in Brooklyn but often spent summers on a farm picking berries to make jam. During a 10-year-stint in Wisconsin, where her husband, a veterinarian, had a farm practice, she learned about canning and freezing, baking bread and pies, butchering pigs and making her own sausage.
After returning to Long Island and raising her four children, Ms. Ross worked as a kindergarten teacher, then took up painting and photography. When her marriage ended suddenly, she found work as a home economics teacher in the Sachem school district. That led to an adjunct position at Queens College and the pursuit of a doctorate. 
By the time she earned her degree in American social and cultural history, Ms. Ross said, women's studies, folklorists, sociologists and anthropologists were all studying food.
"Certainly the men who were writing history 100 years ago or 200 years ago didn't think that there was anything to know," she said. "They were looking at public history, which was largely men's history. It's something that we have recently acknowledged as an equally important part of understanding our past."
Besides cooking demonstrations at festivals, Ms. Ross designs and is a curator of museum exhibits. She recently did a warming kitchen display from a plantation-style Georgian manor for the Rock Hall Museum in Lawrence and is working on a cellar display that includes butchering, dairying and winemaking. She is working with Raynham Hall in Oyster Bay and Mulford Farm in East Hampton.
"Most old houses have beautiful furnishings, gorgeous old fabrics, the right wallpapers," Ms. Ross said. "We are really making a connection between all these farmlands and all the work that we've done and the food that people are eating. It brings to life the rest of the story." 
And she weaves cooking into history lessons at local schools.
"Food is such a universal," Ms. Ross said. "There is something about food that is very reassuring. Everybody digs in. If you say we are going to have a history lesson, it's more likely they'll go eeewwww."

Art of the Cowboy
Practicing the arts of the Wild West is not easy on Long Island. But Chris McDaniel is not your usual cowboy. He has no horse. His ranch is a painted backdrop. And he's more likely to crack his bullwhips at a bar mitzvah or do some fancy roping at a wedding than at a rodeo.
Three years ago, Mr. McDaniel, 46, was hired to play Buffalo Bill for a Wild West show at Deep Hollow Ranch in Montauk celebrating the 100th anniversary of the Rough Riders' stay there. With his long blond hair, mustache, goatee and 10-gallon hat, he needed no makeup. There he met Nina Bataller, a picture framer from East Hampton, who was a re-enactor playing a nurse treating Teddy Roosevelt's quarantined men. It was love at first sight, Mr. McDaniel said. He decided to settle in Springs. The couple was married in June.
Mr. McDaniel spent the past three summers headlining the evening show at Deep Hollow Ranch and doing his cowboy aerobics act at summer camps. Recently, he snagged the role of Buffalo Bill in the coming national tour of "Annie Get Your Gun." He will appear in the production at the Tilles Center on Jan. 20.
"The more that I turn it on and play the hick come to town, the more people eat it up," Mr. McDaniel drawled after a recent performance at the Fall Festival at Deepwells in St. James that included snapping spray-painted noodles with a bullwhip.
"It's different," he said. "It's novel. They've seen magicians. They've seen jugglers. They haven't seen people like me, at least not that often."
Mr. McDaniel was born and raised in southwest Louisiana -- not cow country, but closer to it than Long Island is. He frequented rodeo shows, but found his passion for belting out country tunes while twirling a rope on television.
"Watching Roy Rogers on Saturday afternoon made me fall in love with the cowboy style of life," Mr. McDaniel said. "I never missed a show when I was growing up."
After studying voice in college, Mr. McDaniel appeared in a country music revue show at the Opryland theme park in Nashville and had a touring country rock band. While working as a sound engineer for the country and western star Larry Gatlin, Mr. McDaniel accompanied the singer to the trick-roping lessons he needed for his role as Will Rogers in the "Will Rogers Follies" on Broadway.
"I guess to my love of rodeo and cattle and horses, I really got hooked," Mr. McDaniel said. "It was discovering a passion I never knew I had at all." 
He created his own act, combining cowboy-themed magic with trick roping and bullwhips. He is a regular on the "Monday Night Magic" show at the Sullivan Street Playhouse in Manhattan and is working on a one-man show that he hopes to produce at a theater in the Hamptons next summer. 
"Art is art," Mr. McDaniel said. "The only thing that separates high art from the circuses and sideshows is the wealth of the patron. The circus and sideshow and the freak show and the Wild West show have always been like the common people's entertainment as opposed to ballet or opera. We work as hard on our art as ballerinas or opera singers do."
As a cowboy performer, Mr. McDaniel said he was trying to spread the spirit of independence and common sense of the cowboy experience.
"I kind of want to be a cowboy Captain Kangaroo," he said.

HEADLINE: Ideas & Trends: Getting What You Pay For; 
Now, Uncle Sam Wants You

BYLINE:  By LOUIS UCHITELLE 

 BODY:
FOR the first time since the Reagan years, a president has formally recognized that the federal government is a more appropriate employer than the private sector in a host of areas where the public good is the primary consideration.
 That may not have been President Bush's intention in signing the airport security bill last week, but in nationalizing luggage screening he signaled that some jobs should be protected from market forces -- and even removed from the private sector if necessary. 
 "The principle seems to be that if the service you are concerned about is not going to be profitable to private business, then private business is not going to hire the best people to do the job," said Alan S. Blinder, a Princeton University economist.
That failure to hire the right people for airport security has economists scrambling to sort out who should work for government and who for the private sector -- or who should work for the private sector but with government rather than market forces setting standards and pay levels. While they differ on the details, nearly every economist embraces the notion that higher pay buys skill and dedication in workers, and that these are often necessary attributes in public service. 
Recent research has confirmed that correlation, and the airport security act, embracing these findings, arbitrarily sets pay for security personnel at $17 an hour and up -- double what most of the 28,000 privately employed workers earn to screen passengers and luggage. 
"We don't have much experience in successfully mandating the right wage for a job," said Jared Bernstein, an economist at the Economic Policy Institute. "What we do know is that the market sets too low a wage for quality for child care and teaching, to cite two examples, and for airport security, which helps to explain why there is so much turnover in these occupations."
Before Sept. 11, most executives and some economists insisted that the private sector was the more effective employer in every field. That was the justification for privatizing prisons in several states, and for outsourcing other services once performed by higher-paid government employees. 
THE pressure from customers for quality never seemed to be sufficient to keep school bus or ambulance drivers, for instance, on public payrolls. In the case of airport security, the airlines did not reap profits from paying private contractors to screen luggage. So they paid as little as possible. And until Sept. 11, airline customers did not demand greater quality or were not willing to pay much for it in airfares.
Apart from pay, the fear of terrorism is forcing a debate over who should work for government. Soldiers, police, fire fighters, prison guards -- all these should be government employees, many economists agree. All these jobs require heroism, the use of force and a culture of sacrifice. "We know from the past that mercenaries switch sides or walk away," said James J. Heckman, a University of Chicago economist and a Nobel laureate.
What's more, government is perceived to be more likely than the private sector to spend whatever is necessary to get the job done during crises, which explains why the airport security act sailed through Congress and was quickly signed by the president, although he had expressed a preference for private employment, with government as supervisor and regulator.
That is Mr. Heckman's preference, too. Narrowly focused tasks like screening luggage or driving school buses are best left to the private sector, he argues. The government would let the contracts, not the airlines or some other intermediary. Government would set standards and pay -- as it now does for construction workers on federal projects -- and it would monitor performance. The private employer, meanwhile, has greater incentive to fire poor performers and cut labor costs through automation. 
"I am not saying that government employment will fail," Mr. Heckman said. "I am saying that it is not needed and it is probably counter-productive."
But it is needed, says Joseph E. Stiglitz, a Columbia University economist and also a Nobel laureate. In airport security, government employment is more likely to achieve uniform standards in all the nation's airports, he says, and avoids tensions with private contractors who have an incentive to cut costs in, say, worker training, and thus fatten profits. 
"There is also an intrinsic reward in government employment," Mr. Stiglitz said. "People are often more highly motivated because they believe they are performing a public good. You see this in the National Park Service, which some people have wanted to privatize."

HEADLINE: A NATION CHALLENGED: THE FALLOUT; 
Pakistan's Anxiety Grows as Taliban Collapse

BYLINE:  By JOHN F. BURNS 

DATELINE: ISLAMABAD, Pakistan, Nov. 24 

 BODY:
A senior Pakistani official watched in dismay today as the television in his office showed Taliban fighters, streaming out of Kunduz, Afghanistan, to surrender to the Northern Alliance. 
 "I am sorry to put it in this way," he said, switching off the set, "but Rumsfeld's been extremely callous." 
 For two weeks, Pakistan has been mesmerized by the situation at Kunduz. There were reports that as many as 1,500 Pakistanis were with the Taliban garrison at Kunduz, and that extremists in the Taliban were threatening to execute any who tried to surrender. People across Pakistan feared a blood bath that would reverberate in every mosque in this nation of 140 million Muslims. 
Pakistan's worst fears appear to have receded with the news tonight that many of the fighters surrendering were Pakistanis. Now, the concern will shift to the safety of prisoners in the hands of the alliance, which Pakistan has never trusted.
Still, few here seem likely to forget that when Pakistan appealed for American intervention to work out an arrangement in Kunduz, Secretary of Defense Donald H. Rumsfeld responded, in effect, that the Pakistanis would face the choice of all defeated soldiers in war, surrender or death.
The Kunduz drama has captured the frustration and anger of many Pakistani officials who entrusted their interests in Afghanistan to the United States after Sept. 11, when the Bush administration demanded that Pakistan join in the war against terrorism.
The corollary, as stated and repeated by President Pervez Musharraf, was that Washington would see to it that all of Pakistan's essential interests in Afghanistan were protected.
From the American perspective, the war has gone a long way toward achieving its objectives, with the Taliban driven from power in all but one city, Kandahar, and Al Qaeda terrorists on the run. But from the Pakistani perspective, things have gone badly wrong, and the Americans have not delivered.
Only 10 weeks after General Musharraf pledged his "full support" to the United States, enraging Islamic militants in Pakistan and Islamic hard-liners in the army, the sense that the United States has failed to keep its side of the deal is rife, from the bazaars of cities to the offices where senior aides to General Musharraf ponder how to extricate Pakistan from the problems the war has caused. 
Pakistan's gains have been substantial, especially financially, with the removal of American economic sanctions and the giving of fresh aid and help in debt payments. But strategically, the war has been a disaster in the minds of most Pakistanis. 
Two weeks ago, when President Bush and General Musharraf met in New York, Mr. Bush pressed the Northern Alliance not to capture Kabul. But when the general returned home days later, he arrived just in time to see alliance troops pouring into the Afghan capital. 
Northern Alliance leaders are contemptuous of Pakistan for supporting the Taliban before the Sept. 11 attacks. Another division is that the alliance draws its support, including its arms and much of its financing, from three countries regarded as potentially hostile to Pakistan: India, Russia and Iran.
Next Tuesday, the United Nations will convene a conference in Germany at which Northern Alliance leaders will sit down with opposition leaders from the Pashtun tribal group that dominates southern and eastern Afghanistan. The Pakistanis have low hopes for that meeting, believing that alliance leaders will begin a process of endless negotiation that will leave the alliance as the de facto government in Kabul. 
Ever since Pakistan came into being in 1947, a primary goal has been to ensure that it keeps a friendly government to the west, in Afghanistan, since it already faced the unfriendly state of India, to the east. With the alliance in Kabul, the risk of having unfriendly governments on either side look real. 
With the German meeting coming up, General Musharraf has said little about the situation, other than repeating his "expectation" that the talks will begin the process of establishing a provisional government with strong Pashtun representation that would be friendly to Pakistan. But privately, Pakistani officials say, the general is deeply skeptical that alliance leaders will keep their promise, especially to cede military control of Kabul to a force comprising Pashtun units.
General Musharraf has bitten his tongue, hoping that the Bonn meeting will prove his worst fears wrong, Pakistani officials suggest. He does so knowing that his own standing in Pakistan would be seriously undermined if he were to say that the United States has broken a promise to him.
"But the fact that he's not saying anything right now does not mean that he's calm," one official said. "Privately, he's telling people that if the alliance hold on Kabul is not broken, his position could become untenable."
President Musharraf took a considerable risk supporting the Americans, letting them use Pakistan's airspace, providing them with intelligence and leasing several airfields for use by American spacial operations troops.
President Bush's emissary to the rival Afghan political groups, James F. Dobbins, met with alliance leaders this week and later said he had told them that the West would withhold billions of dollars in reconstruction aid for Afghanistan until a "broad-based government" was set up. "It's a big carrot," he said.
But many Pakistanis with experience of dealing with Afghanistan have concluded that American policy is naive, or else cynical. Those holding the latter view contend that the Bush administration sees itself within reach of accomplishing its goals in Afghanistan and cares little about accomplishing Pakistan's.
In this view, the United States will accept a Northern Alliance government in Kabul if it has to, because the only means of removing it would be to go to war with the alliance. But if the alliance is left in control of Kabul and other cities, these Pakistanis say, the United States will have set the stage for a new civil war.
"If Sept. 11 was a tragedy, there is a bigger tragedy ahead,", said Lt. Gen. Hamid Gul, who was director-general of Pakistan's military intelligence agency, Inter-Services Intelligence, when the withdrawal of Soviet troops in Afghanistan gave way to a civil war and who is regarded in Pakistan as having strong sympathies for Islamic militants. 
Even among aides to General Musharraf, there are officials who agree, and one senior policy maker said Washington could witness a devil's choice of a new civil war against Pashtuns or taking back the capital from the alliance. 
"If the Americans are not very careful with that ambitious little lot, they will find themselves in an unholy mess," he said. "Right now, peace in Afghanistan hangs by a thread."

HEADLINE: MARKET INSIGHT; 
How Much Of a Surge For Security Stocks?

BYLINE:  By KENNETH N. GILPIN 

 BODY:
AMERICANS spend a lot on protection. David Hale, chief economist at Zurich Financial Services, estimates public and private sector spending on security at $250 billion a year. That excludes the Pentagon. 
 In the aftermath of Sept. 11, those numbers are likely to rise. Mr. Hale, for one, figures that the spending could increase 10 percent to 20 percent over the next two years. Prices of some security products and service company stocks have soared since the attacks. 
 Jeffrey Kessler, a business services analyst at Lehman Brothers, took some time last week to discuss the prospects for the companies he covers. Following are excerpts from the conversation.

Q. Historically, what has been the growth rate of the security industry?

A. The entire industry is a mid-single-digit grower, somewhere between 5 percent and 7 percent.
 That includes a mix of very low-growth businesses like locks and fences, a more stable monitoring alarm business and a guard business that grows about 3 percent to 5 percent a year. Then there are a whole host of areas like radio frequency identification, electronic article surveillance, closed-circuit television access control systems and biometrics. 
Depending on the technology, those businesses are growing anywhere from 10 percent to 50 percent annually.

Q. In a recent presentation to analysts, Tyco International said that there were more than 13,000 independent alarm companies. How many security companies do you cover?

A. Among the first companies I covered on Wall Street in 1983 were ADT and Sensormatic Electronics. Tyco now owns them both. Of the 16 companies I cover, about one-third are security companies. It used to be two-thirds. That is all because of consolidation in the business.

Q. Are events stemming from Sept. 11 likely to change the growth outlook for security companies?

A. There are parts that have changed dramatically since Sept. 11. The consulting business, for instance, has begun to boom. Companies like Kroll Inc. and Armor Holdings Inc. have seen a huge pickup in inquiries. We won't know for a little while whether this will produce lasting revenues.
On the biometrics side, we have seen a surge in inquiries for secure area access for high-profile facilities like airports and sensitive corporate facilities. Companies like Identix Inc. and Visionics Corporation are getting lots of calls. So are bomb-protection companies like InVision Technologies. 
But in the past, interest in these companies goes up every time there has been an incident. We won't know until January or February, when these companies release their fourth-quarter results, if the most recent events are going to translate into sustainable revenue events.

Q. Some very big companies, like Tyco International and Honeywell, have sizable security service businesses. Are those stocks a more prudent way to invest in the industry?

A. It is fair to say that security has become about one-third of Tyco's business, so there is enough in there to make it a proxy for a safe method of investing in the industry. Honeywell's security business is much smaller. In the case of smaller alarm and alarm monitoring businesses like Pittston Brinks Group, which is in the process of selling its coal assets, security represents just about all of the operating income.

Q. You seem skeptical that attitudes have changed about spending on security. How, if at all, does the airport security bill that President Bush signed into law alter that view?

A. You have to realize that security is a negative sell. It is very similar to insurance.
Up until Sept. 11, I had completely given up on this society being willing to pay up to $2.50 per ticket for airport security equal to that provided in Israel and Europe. Now we have that. Eventually, we will also pay more for more ubiquitous technology as well, be it bomb detection or biometrics. 
We can find the money to pay for more security. But it may take longer to shift attitudes toward greater security and less privacy than merely paying for it. The immediate runup in the price of some of these security stocks, which in some cases more than tripled in price, indicates we are not going back to the state of grace we had before Sept. 11.

Q. Which stocks are you recommending?

A. Our most speculative stock, either boom or bust, is Identix. We would buy Armor Holdings and Pittston on weakness. We have an outperform rating on Checkpoint Systems, another antitheft provider. And we have an outperform ranking on Symbol Technologies Inc., the leading provider of bar code and data gathering systems through bar codes.

HEADLINE: Near Ground Zero, A Medical Gap 

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re "For Downtown, Vacant Offices and Lost Vigor" (news article, Nov. 19):
 As a family physician practicing four blocks from the site of the World Trade Center, I can attest to the fact that people are not only conducting far less business downtown, but they are also forgoing routine and preventive health care. 
This is a consequence of several factors: relocation of families and workers from the vicinity, a reluctance of people to travel near the scene of the disaster for doctor visits, and, sadly, extensive layoffs that have hit downtown businesses. 
 With a further deterioration in the economy and additional layoffs, the city may face a health care crisis: a large population of uninsured individuals who are unable to afford medical treatment.

Hucksters or patriots? You be the judge. It's again time for 20 questions on Madison Avenue.

BYLINE:  By Stuart Elliott

 BODY:
IT'S time again to ask 20 questions about advertising, marketing and the media, in this instance a special edition that could be called "The selling of Sept. 11."
 *Will more consumers clip coupons found in Sunday newspaper inserts distributed by Valassis Communications now that they carry abstract versions of the American flag and the words "Liberty and justice for all"? 
 *Will it put off patriotic shoppers to find that the "America the Beautiful pave compact" that is part of the Holiday Compact Collection sold by the Estee Lauder Companies is decorated with "Austrian crystals"?
*After the loss of business suffered by many retailers after Sept. 11, is it still necessary to promote "Customer Appreciation Day" sales because every day now ought to be customer appreciation day? 
*How many consumers will be wooed to shop on the Staples Web site by a banner ad promising free "American Flag Post-it Notes" with every order of $150 or more?
*Will the Democratic National Committee attract more contributions after sending appeals in envelopes with American flags above the words "Printed and mailed with pride from the heartland of America Green Bay, Wis. U.S.A."?
*Was it necessary for the Fox Broadcasting Company division of the News Corporation to run promotional spots for the series "Dark Angel" promising that it "takes fear to a whole new level"?
*If so many marketing experts predicted that after Sept. 11 advertisers would avoid making claims that assail competitors by name because consumers would consider them unseemly, why are there so many ads lately like the one for Swanson Chicken Broth, sold by the Campbell Soup Company, carrying this aggressive headline: "Swanson gives you more chicken flavor. College Inn chickens out"?
*Is it a coincidence that the Bradford Exchange, a company known for so-called collectible products, is suddenly selling a figurine called "Angel of Protection" showing a firefighter standing behind a winged angel, and another figurine called "Heroes at Work," showing two firefighters posed next to a Maltese cross, the traditional symbol of American firefighters?
*Is anyone surprised that the ads for the figurines make no mention of donations of any portion of the $39.95 price of either -- plus an additional $5.99 for postage and handling for each figurine ordered -- to any charities on behalf of firefighters?
*Did ads for USA Today, published by the Gannett Company, carrying the headline "One nation. One newspaper" not complete that thought by including the phrase "indivisible, with liberty and justice for all" because USA Today is usually divisible into four sections?
*Is anyone ordering from newspaper ads run by a California company named Heavy Hitter Industries a 36-inch baseball bat with "a deep-carved U.S.A. red, white and blue logo," which is being sold for $79.95 ("plus an additional $10 for shipping and handling") under the headline "Going to Bat for America"?
*Did the editors of The Ladies' Home Journal, published by the Meredith Corporation, consult with a soothsayer, a palm-reader or a crystal-ball gazer in deciding to wait until April to publish a special issue called "The Best of America"?
*Will tourists be more or less willing to visit vacation spots like the United States Virgin Islands that play up their American roots and heritage in ads?
*How many buyers of the "American Freedom Flag Collection" ($14.95, "plus $4.95 postage and handling") from a company called Publishers Choice or the "America Unites" flag collection ($39.95, "and $5.95 shipping and handling") from a company named the American Historical Society will actually ever fly, display or hang any of the flags for which they are (over)paying?
*Of all the collections of patriotic music being sold after Sept. 11, how many could match "American Spirit," a compilation of "35 timeless American classics" being sold through television commercials by a company called Razor and Tie Direct, which includes a version of "God Bless America" sung by the King himself, Elvis Presley?
*With all the tributes to firefighters that have appeared in the last two months, was it counterproductive for Diamond Brands to run a newspaper ad urging shoppers to buy American-made goods that was illustrated with samples of its best-known product, Diamond Strike On Box Large Kitchen Matches?
*How come Frederick's of Hollywood could donate to charities all the profits from the sale of the "limited edition Patriotic (Thong) Panty," which was decorated with an American flag and the words "America the Beautiful," and many other ostensibly more respectable retailers gave little or nothing?
*How many people will rush to buy a collectible product called "Proud and Free," a sculpted eagle's head being sold for $39.95 ("add $4.99 for shipping and handling") by a firm called Hamilton Collection once they learn from the fine print of the ads that it is "beautifully crafted of sparkling crystalline"?
*Will a print ad for travelers checks sold by the American Express Company, which shows a check torn in half next to the word "Indestructible," make readers uncomfortable because it may evoke images of the torn papers found in Lower Manhattan after the World Trade Center towers fell?
*Will Henry Kissinger pause as he runs the bases at Yankee Stadium or Woody Allen stop making figure eights at the Rockefeller Center skating rink or Yogi Berra take five from conducting the "Phil Harmonic" to tell an advertising columnist, "You ask a lot of questions for someone from Brooklyn"?

The time may have come for a national corps of technology experts to protect and repair vital information systems.

BYLINE:  By Amy Cortese

 BODY:
IN the aftermath of Sept. 11, a new spirit of civil service is sweeping the country. Volunteers and donors have swamped the Red Cross, the Salvation Army and other agencies with offers of help. Seizing on the national mood, President Bush has called for the creation of a civil defense service that would supplement security efforts by the police, fire departments and public health agencies. That call to civic duty mirrors a bipartisan Senate proposal that would quintuple the size of AmeriCorps, the domestic Peace Corps initiated by President Bill Clinton.
 But even with those efforts, there is a sense that something more is needed. National security is no longer just about patrolling borders and securing airports, bridges and ports; it is also about protecting the nation's information infrastructure. 
 "There is a big hole to be filled in an expanding national service system," said Will Marshall, president of the Progressive Policy Institute, a Democratic research center in Washington. "The more we become dependent on the information backbone, the more we need to be prepared." 
To be sure, the nation is increasingly reliant on technology -- communication systems like cellphones, e-mail and broadcast television, and computer networks that run everything from bond trades to hospitals to the power grid.
Yet, as the terrorist attacks showed, a physical attack can have wide-ranging reverberations: the obliteration of the antenna on top of the World Trade Center left hundreds of thousands of New Yorkers without television broadcasts, and the damage to Verizon telephone switches took out much of the city's phone network. Cellular phone networks, though undamaged, were overloaded. 
Though overshadowed by the rescue mission, volunteers, large and small, have come forward to aid the technological relief effort. Companies like Accenture, AOL Time Warner, I.B.M., and Cisco donated personnel, equipment and money to help restore business operations and to cobble together databases, communications networks and support systems for victims and relief agencies. Local organizations pitched in, too: Webgrrls, a group of 4,000 women in new media, volunteered its services to the Red Cross. Group members worked around the clock building databases to help manage the influx of offers of help and creating a Web-based system to collect and organize volunteer applications.
Yet some people are asking if these ad hoc efforts could have been handled better. Could an organized group of professional volunteers culled from the nation's high-technology companies help aid the recovery of future disasters -- or even prevent them? Is there a need for the technology equivalent of a National Guard?
These questions have been floated in high-technology circles and on Capitol Hill. Senator Ron Wyden, Democrat of Oregon, is championing a proposal for a National Emergency Technology Guard, or NetGuard, and plans to hold hearings on the issue in December. "Technology and science is the one area that has not yet been mobilized to achieve its maximum potential," said Senator Wyden, who is chairman of the Senate Commerce Subcommittee on Science and Technology. 
At issue is how best to use the nation's technology sector, with its approximately 14.5 million workers. 
The idea behind NetGuard is to create a national volunteer force, drawn initially from the nation's top high-technology concerns, that could mobilize quickly in the case of an emergency. Its role would be to repair downed communications systems, restore computer operations and create new systems to aid support and recovery efforts. These volunteers would receive training periodically, as do members of the National Guard, and would have a clear chain of command to coordinate efforts. In addition, NetGuard would be responsible for maintaining a strategic reserve of equipment -- like cellphones, switches, computers and satellite dishes -- that could be deployed on short notice.
Many officials warn that areas of the country without New York's density, leadership and access to the resources of so many large corporations could have faced an even more daunting recovery. "You wonder how other areas would be able to handle something like this without that technology and expertise and preparedness in place," said David Moskovitz, a partner at Accenture. 
A technology volunteer corps could also help with prevention. It has become clear that better sharing of information is needed, whether among local and federal agencies or the private sector and the government. A technology corps could help build and maintain a database that tracks volunteers and their expertise -- doctors with knowledge of smallpox, say, or technology professionals who are experts on computer viruses, said Andrew Rasiej, a New York entrepreneur and chief architect behind NetGuard. 
Perhaps most important, a technology corps could help bridge the gap between the high-technology sector and the new mission of domestic security. America's high-technology prowess and creativity are unmatched in the world, yet many government agencies are lacking in technological skill and knowledge. "The information-technology community needs to lead the way," Mr. Rasiej said. 
NetGuard is just an idea at this point, and many issues must be resolved, including how such a corps would be organized. But perhaps the biggest obstacle is persuading members of the technology community to work together. 
"The key requirement here is leadership to inspire people to put aside their parochial day-to-day differences and realize that this is in the national interest," said Scott Cook, chairman of Intuit, a maker of accounting, tax and small-business software, which is based in Menlo Park, Calif. For an idea like NetGuard to succeed, he said, it must be driven by the highest levels of government, much the way President John F. Kennedy pushed forward the Peace Corps. 
The first step will be Senator Wyden's hearing, scheduled for Dec. 5, which is expected to include relief agencies and technology concerns. Senator Wyden says he has discussed the issue with and received encouragement from technology leaders like Intel's chairman, Andrew S. Grove, and McCaw Cellular's founder, Craig O. McCaw. 
"There is a tremendous array of talent and energy in the private sector that would like to help here," Senator Wyden said. "We're going to look at how private sector companies can make the most useful contribution in a crisis situation."
No matter the outcome of the hearing, it is clear that the ingenuity of the country's high-technology talent is sorely needed. "The real power and creativity lies out there in the private sector and in the community," said Mr. Marshall of the Progressive Policy Institute. "We're in an era now where we have to respond as a society."

Professors Study Method for Doing Well on EBay

BYLINE:  By STEVE LOHR 

 BODY:
Trying to put markets for everything under the sun -- think groceries and pet food -- on the Internet was a demonstrably bad idea. But clearly, there are some markets made for the online medium, like the virtual auctions managed by eBay. Price discovery, in economic terms, is easy and open, a wealth of data can be presented, and transaction costs are low. 
 Those very characteristics work to the advantage of researchers, especially those like Charles Wood, an assistant professor of management at the University of Notre Dame, who was a software developer before joining academia. Mr. Wood wrote a nifty little Java program, called eDrill, to automate the collection of data off the Web. He and Robert Kauffman, an associate professor at the University of Minnesota's graduate school of management, then embarked on a study of coin auctions on eBay, from 1999 to 2001. 
 The pair chose auctions of mostly 19th century coins because there is a brisk trade in them, and the coins have a standard price-list value -- a good market, they figured, for valid comparisons of buying and selling behavior online. Besides, Mr. Wood said, "I'm a coin collector."
Their conclusions? It is said that a picture is worth a thousand words, but in Internet auctions it is worth about 12 percent, according to the professors. That is, if two coins of the same type, age and condition were auctioned on eBay, the one accompanied by a picture sold for 12 percent more than a text-only offering.
Equivalent coins sold for 2 percent more on weekends that during weekdays. The effect held up for the same bidders and the same items. The weekend effect, Mr. Wood said, was a little surprising. But he speculated there was a "comfort factor" when people had time to consider a purchase over the weekend. "No matter what economists might think, not everyone is a calculating machine," Mr. Wood said.
Next month, Mr. Wood will present a paper on online shilling, the practice of pumping up the price of your own merchandise, either yourself or through an intermediary. Mostly, he said, "they run up the bid early, and they drop out," rather than risk being left holding the final bid. STEVE LOHR

Europe Plans a Constellation of Satellites

BYLINE:  By JENNIFER 8. LEE 

 BODY:
Around the world, countries are mobilizing to build independent satellite navigation networks, troubled that the Global Positioning System, the only functioning worldwide network, is run by the United States military and controlled by the government.
 In the last decade or so, the continuous signals emitted by a constellation of orbiting satellites have allowed users to compute time, location and speed with high accuracy, calculations that play an increasing role in everything from firing missiles in Afghanistan to guiding ships at sea to flashing directions in rental cars. As the American technology becomes a worldwide standard, foreign governments are wary that that dependence raises issues of strategic and economic security. 
 The United States government sees its Global Positioning System, or G.P.S., as a resource freely available to the world. Even foreign militaries use it. It is managed by an interagency board, but is operated by the Defense Department, a fact that raises qualms around the world. 
But other countries see the system as an American monopoly, intent on reinforcing its dominion. "Europe cannot accept reliance on a military system which has the possibility of being cut off," said Rene Oosterlinck, head of the navigation department at the European Space Agency, fairly summing up the emotions G.P.S. elicits abroad.
In response, Europe will spend billions assembling a civil satellite system called Galileo, scheduled to be in operation by 2008. By the end of this year, Europe is expected to have allocated 1.1 billion euros ($966 million) to Galileo, with another 450 million euros expected to be approved by the European Transport Commission next week.
China, which hopes to build an independent satellite navigation system within the next decade, launched two experimental positioning satellites last year. The Beidou navigation satellites, named after the Northern Ladle, or Big Dipper in Chinese, sit in an orbit over China. The government uses the systems for things like urban traffic control and earthquake monitoring.
Russia has said it will launch three satellites before the end of the year to resuscitate its ailing Global Navigation Satellite System, a military-operated system known as Glonass. It was first designed with 24 satellites when it went into operation in 1993, but aging satellites dropped out of service as Russia's economic health declined. Only six satellites are now running; new satellites would bring the total up to nine.
Galileo has the most momentum of the alternative satellite projects, and has sparked interest in countries outside Europe. Canada has been financially involved in the early stages of the project. Russia has lent technical expertise and is looking for a bigger role. China has shown a strong desire to participate. And other countries, including Israel, India, South Africa and Australia, have expressed interest.
The United States has promoted G.P.S. as a global standard. In addition to its military and transportation applications, G.P.S. is used because it provides a relatively inexpensive and highly accurate time signal for synchronization. The time synchronization is used in networks like power grids, telecommunications and banking. Disruption in G.P.S. would cause those networks to slow down, but not necessarily fail.
Galileo arose from Europe's concerns about falling behind the United States technologically. At an estimated cost of 3.6 billion euros (about $3.16 billion) for design and deployment, Galileo would be the most significant infrastructure project by the European Union to date.
In the long run, the European Union envisions Galileo as a private-public partnership. But some question the economic wisdom of spending billions of euros, expecting private support and then charging for a certified signal when the G.P.S. signal is free, reliable and a worldwide standard. 
"Galileo is a very confusing system, at least to my American mind," said Pete Brumbaugh, a spokesman for Garmin International, which makes G.P.S. receiving equipment. "There is already this really equitable system. There are already receivers that provide incredible accuracy to users worldwide."
An independent study released by PricewaterhouseCoopers last week, however, predicted that Galileo would have considerable economic benefits. Europe also wants a larger share of the billions of dollars made in maintaining and making satellite navigation equipment. Right now that business is dominated by the United States and Japan.
The European Union says that the United States cannot guarantee the reliability and availability of the G.P.S. civilian signal, as United States national security needs could potentially trump any other needs. In contrast, Galileo proposals describe a free public signal as well as certified services available for governments or paying subscribers.
Analysts see an advantage to having a system separate for G.P.S. in case of any sort of disruption. "It provides a lot more accessibility, redundancy, robustness," said Glen Gibbons, editor of GPS World, a satellite navigation trade publication. 
The emphasis on homeland defense since Sept. 11 has increased support for redundant satellite systems, Mr. Oosterlinck said.
The G.P.S. system, which gained prominence during the Gulf War, was originally developed for the United States military. The system was made available for public use in 1993, with a separate, intentionally degraded civilian signal that provided less accurate positioning as a built-in obstacle to anyone using the system for criminal or rogue purposes.
Last year, however, the United States stopped degrading the civilian signal because advances in technologies -- like jamming -- now allow the military to selectively interfere with signals wherever it wants to -- for instance, in arenas of armed combat like Kosovo or Afghanistan. On Sept. 17, the United States reiterated that it had no future intention of degrading the public signal. But these statements have only slightly soothed international concerns.
Minor friction has emerged between the United States and Europe over the development of Galileo, and American officials have expressed skepticism about the relative costs and benefits of the project.
As Galileo continues to move forward, the United States has voiced concerns about trade, security and technology standards. The last diplomatic meeting on Galileo and G.P.S. took place in late October. At the meeting, the two sides began serious discussions about the text of fundamental principles for Galileo, said Ralph Braibanti, head of the Galileo and G.P.S. negotiating team for the State Department.
Some officials in the Defense Department are concerned about an independent satellite system that could erode their military advantage. While it is cooperating in creating shared standards, the United States has insisted that Galileo not interfere with the parts of the spectrum used for American military signals.
In addition, the United States government fears Europe may impose regulatory restrictions that give European industry technological advantages over its American counterpart. As an example of such past regulations, American officials point to a proposed restriction on jet engine mufflers, called hushkits, which was seen as an attempt to protect European aviation industries by disproportionately affecting American aircraft and equipment manufacturers.
Another technology developed under the American military which has since passed into wide international use is the Internet. But whereas G.P.S. is strictly under American control, the Internet was intentionally designed with no central authority. 
The ultimate implications of Galileo will only be sorted out in the minutiae of negotiations. Politicians, industry executives and trade representatives are wrangling over what type of institutions and structures should manage a dual-use technology that transcends borders and oceans. 
"It really is a global utility and it's a new one," said Mr. Gibbons, of GPS World. "People are still trying to get their minds around what it all means."

HEADLINE: Telecommunications Entrepreneur With a Colorful Resume 

BYLINE:  By SIMON ROMERO

DATELINE: HACKETTSTOWN, N.J. 

 BODY:
From the living room of his home in a gated community here, Gary Breshinsky is plotting his return to Afghanistan.
 Spread on the floor are political and physical maps he acquired from the Shah M. Book Company in Kabul. Entered into speed-dial on his telephone are the cellular numbers of Northern Alliance representatives. Hanging in the closet is traditional Afghan garb ready to be donned at a moment's notice. 
 "My aspiration is to be part of Afghanistan's reconstruction," said Mr. Breshinsky, a tall, burly 53-year-old with a nasal inflection that reveals his Long Island upbringing. "I would like to put my skills to use." 
Defining those skills more precisely, Mr. Breshinsky lets loose a torrent of autobiographical detail, describing an odyssey that took him from the suburbs of New York to hot spots in the Middle East, Africa and Central Asia before returning to the United States with his wife, who is Swedish, and their triplet daughters to settle down in New Jersey.
At the top of Mr. Breshinsky's resume-cum-life story is his experience setting up a telecommunications network in Afghanistan in the late 1990's. Together with investors from the United States, Britain and Sweden, Mr. Breshinsky struck a deal with the Taliban to establish the Afghan Wireless Communication Company, whose network has emerged largely unscathed from bombing raids in recent weeks.
Mr. Breshinsky said he left the venture after the United States imposed trade sanctions against Afghanistan in 1999, but Afghan Wireless, with about 9,000 customers, remains afloat. That number of customers not may sound like a lot, but in a country with only about 40,000 telephone lines for a population of 26 million, it is one of Afghanistan's most important links with the rest of the world.
Now, with the nation's power structure in flux, Mr. Breshinsky is hoping to return as an executive at the company or in another capacity to help manage Afghanistan's telecommunications system. 
Mr. Breshinsky's ambition of returning to Afghanistan could be viewed as a reflection of a midlife crisis or a yearning to make money in a far-flung foreign venture. But the explanation of his interest in Afghanistan is derived from something more fantastical, if not entirely absurd.
According to Mr. Breshinsky's own account, he first became interested in Afghanistan when he went there as "a concerned private citizen" in the early 1980's to fight with mujahedeen against the Soviet Army. His involvement there came after forays to other flash points in the 1970's.
After graduating from Fairleigh Dickinson University in New Jersey with a degree in psychology, Mr. Breshinsky said, he moved to Europe, where he developed an interest in the psychology of kidnappers and terrorists after a spate of hijackings and bombings occurred.
It is at this stage that Mr. Breshinsky's story becomes murky. Through contacts at the Central Intelligence Agency, he said, he began advising European officials on how to negotiate with terrorists. 
With the C.I.A.'s support, Mr. Breshinsky said, he formed an organization whose mandate was to work against terrorists and their supporters through blackmail, depletion of funds through offshore banking operations and, at times, assassination.
Mr. Breshinsky said he had coordinated the group from a small base in Cyprus. The work was grueling, however, and it took its toll, he said. After suffering an injury in an operation, he said, he felt burned out, so he took a break and moved to southern Spain. He lived a playboy's existence there, he said, complete with a red Maserati and several beautiful girlfriends. 
According to Mr. Breshinsky, the jet-setting life did not last long, and work soon took him to places like Angola and Afghanistan. But by the mid-1980's, after the birth of his daughters, Mr. Breshinsky decided to retire as an antiterrorist operative. 
Mr. Breshinsky acknowledges that the tale of his experiences before he became a New Jersey satellite telephone salesman in the 1990's and then, in 1997, became involved in the Afghan venture, sounds outlandish. 
But he said he could not provide proof of his activities because photographs and written documents related to his time as an antiterrorist operative had either been lost or stolen in burglaries.
Without such evidence, it would seem that Mr. Breshinsky's account is the product of a vivid imagination. The C.I.A. declined to comment on his claims, and the F.B.I., which Mr. Breshinsky said he had briefed about his recent business dealings in Afghanistan, also declined to comment.
He has his detractors, including Lord Michael Cecil, one of the investors in Telephone Systems International, the New Jersey company that carried out the investment in Afghanistan. 
"Mr. Breshinsky was an employee of T.S.I. and not an investor," Lord Michael said. "It would be quite amazing if any intelligence agency had ever employed or worked with Mr. Breshinsky or anyone remotely like him." Others have a different view.
"Gary is one of the most fascinating people I have ever met," said Len Sherman, whose company, ECG Films of Phoenix, has acquired the movie rights to Mr. Breshinsky's life story. "I honestly don't know if every detail of what he says is the truth. What I do know is that this guy has been through a lot in his life."
Relatively little can be easily confirmed about Mr. Breshinsky, aside from information in real estate, court and voting records. Fairleigh Dickinson does not have any records of his attendance or graduation. 
His only living relative, he said, is his brother, Jeff, also of Hacketts town. The brothers went into business together in the early 1990's with a venture to sell satellite telephones and other telecommunications products; that was shut down earlier this year. Jeff Breshinsky declined to be interviewed.
Nearly all of the available public information on Mr. Breshinsky is the result of a bankruptcy filing he made in 1988. 
He was born on Dec. 23, 1947, and is registered as an independent voter. He has owned the comfortable, if sparsely furnished home where he lives with his family since 1995. His Social Security number was also used by a man named John Canepa who died in 1990. He is fairly litigious, having been involved in nearly a dozen lawsuits in the last decade as a debtor or a plaintiff.
Some outlandish-sounding accounts from Mr. Breshinsky have been verified. For example, in Kabul, he said, he stumbled upon evidence of trade, or perhaps contraband, between the Taliban and Iran, in the form of telephone switching equipment designed by Siemens, the German electronics company, with writing on it in Persian. 
Siemens confirmed Mr. Breshinsky's claim. Through its office in Tehran, Siemens sold the equipment to Iran's national telephone company, only to have the customer report it missing after a few months.
When a team of Siemens officials from neighboring Pakistan went to Afghanistan in 1998, they saw the missing equipment in Kabul being used as part of the Taliban-controlled telephone system.
"We cannot tell you how it got there, but it was there," said Bud Grebey, a Siemens spokesman. "Breshinsky's information was correct."
Other claims are harder to confirm, like the meeting Mr. Breshinsky said he had in Kandahar, Afghanistan, in early 1998 with Mullah Wakil Ahmed Muttawakil, a Taliban official, and Osama bin Laden. At that meeting, Mr. Breshinsky said, Mr. bin Laden gave the telecommunications project his blessing.
"Bin Laden was a weird guy with a facial twitch," Mr. Breshinsky said. "His presence was less than impressive."
Mr. Breshinsky said he was talking openly about his life of international intrigue in the hope that he could improve Afghanistan's infrastructure while collecting a steady salary. 
He needs the job. Aside from some part-time marketing work for Federal Goose Control, a Flanders, N.J., company that rids corporate campuses of Canada geese, he has been unemployed since leaving Telephone Systems International more than two years ago. Since then, his wife has been supporting the family.
So far, it seems, his strategy for generating publicity seems to be working. His exploits have been described in Talk magazine and he has been interviewed by the Fox television network. But it is not clear whether Mr. Breshinsky's career will be helped. He said his negotiations with Northern Alliance representatives were proceeding slowly. 
"Gary is a vivid example of the extremes of international business," said Ted Rose, a New York-based writer who has researched Mr. Breshinsky's life. "If he was once a player in Afghanistan, there's no reason why he couldn't become one again."

HEADLINE: Patents; 
Using a seaweed to counteract a fungus that can harm cattle but is needed to help the grass grow.

BYLINE:  By Teresa Riordan; Patents may be viewed on the Web at www.uspto.gov or may be ordered through the mail, by patent number, for $3 from the Patent and Trademark Office, Washington, D.C. 20231.

 BODY:
VIVIEN GORE ALLEN and her colleague Korinn E. Saker have come up with a novel way to keep cattle healthy: just sprinkle a pasture with seaweed.
 According to Professor Allen and Dr. Saker, cattle are often afflicted by a disease called fescue toxicosis. That is because tall-grass fescue, the predominant grazing grass in the United States, is widely infected with a microscopic fungus. Cattle that eat the fungus are inclined to loll about in shady mud holes at a time when cattle ranchers would prefer them to be out grazing, fattening themselves up. 
 The main reason the diseased cattle prefer to cool themselves rather than eat, says Dr. Saker, a veterinary nutritional immunologist at Virginia Tech, is that, inexplicably, they never shed their winter coats. So in the middle of summer, when they are supposed to have a shiny, thin coat of hair, they have a thick, dirty, shaggy coat that causes a persistently high body temperature. 
"It's a major economic problem in the livestock industry," said Ms. Allen, the Thornton distinguished professor in plant cell science at Texas Tech. Indeed, it costs at least $600 million a year in lost cattle or low carcass weight. 
But getting rid of the fungus is not an option. The fungus protects the fescue against all manner of disease; in exchange, the fungus -- which grows between the plant's cells and which is not visible to the naked eye -- gets food and shelter from the plant. Try to break up this cozy friendship, and it "opens up a Pandora's box for the plant," Professor Allen said. "If you get rid of the fungus, the fescue is exposed to a lot of stress," she said. 
In researching the disease, Dr. Saker and her colleagues discovered that the animals were deficient in copper. Speculating that a copper deficiency might trigger the toxicosis, they first tried administering a copper bolus. "Essentially it's a big old capsule that you shove down their throat and it sits in their stomach and breaks down over time," she said. Copper supplements did perk up the cows, she said. 
But then they simply tried fertilizing the grass with Ascophylum nodosum, a brown seaweed found off the coast of Nova Scotia.
Professor Allen and Dr. Saker, working with several colleagues, discovered that animals fed the seaweed-fertilized fescue were protected against toxicosis even though the grasses they grazed upon harbored the fungus. "We got a more long-lasting effect when we used seaweed," she said. Moreover, it was cheaper and less labor-intensive than the copper bolus.
The fortified forage, it turns out, is full of antioxidants like copper, vitamins C and E, superoxide dismutase, and glutathione reductase. "The turf work has shown repeatedly that we're getting this increased antioxidant activity and our suspicion -- we don't have direct proof of this -- is that this is what is affecting the animals' immunity," Professor Allen said.
The research, which was based on a study of about 250 cattle over three years, was published earlier this year in the Journal of Animal Science. According to that research, the blood samples taken at different periods showed increased immunity for seaweed-nourished cattle. The cattle also gained more weight than other cattle and, once they were slaughtered, the meat from their carcasses had a longer shelf life.
These findings may have big commercial repercussions. This month, Professor Allen and Dr. Saker and colleagues received patent 6,312,709, which is the third patent to be issued covering this seaweed supplementation. Several more patents are pending and the entire patent portfolio has been licensed to Acadian Sea Plants Ltd., based in Dartmouth, Nova Scotia.
"They have been field-testing this extensively in two large commercial feedlot operations and we're very close to getting a significant market for this," said Walter Haeussler, director of technology transfer and intellectual property for Texas Tech, which along with Virginia Tech owns the technology. "We've had to do a lot of research to determine the correct dosage and timing of feeding of seaweed to cattle to get certain effects. If you give too much you can actually get less than maximum benefit. It's not a matter of 'if a little bit works then a lot works better.' "
Dr. Saker speculated that the seaweed would not only make the cattle healthier but might also result in beef that is rich in antioxidants and thus more healthful for consumers. "We're making the assumption that if it can happen in cattle it can happen in poultry, in swine, in eggs and in milk," she said.
Does this research mean that health-conscious Americans should themselves start bingeing on seaweed, which is a common ingredient in Asian diets?
"This has very potent physiological effects, whether it's a plant or an animal," Professor Allen said. "But we've got to know more about the long-term impact before we recommend it to a human being. There are many different types of seaweeds -- brown, red and green seaweeds -- just as there are many different kinds of dogs or trees. Will other seaweeds do it? We don't know, because we haven't had the opportunity to test them."

HEADLINE: Canada's Global City (Not Toronto) 

BYLINE:  By BARBARA CROSSETTE 

DATELINE: VANCOUVER 

 BODY:
Call it the un-Toronto.
 Vancouver, Canada's third-largest city, is giving the country a new international face, and anyone asked about it seems eager to explain why it will be nothing like Toronto's. 
 Toronto may have the largest proportion of what Canadians call "visible minorities," mostly immigrants from Asia, Africa and the Caribbean, but Vancouver has the more cosmopolitan look, an Asian-Pacific look to be exact.
A quarter of metropolitan Vancouver's people list Chinese -- usually Cantonese or Mandarin -- as their mother tongue. South Asians, speaking Punjabi, Hindi and Urdu, are close behind. Any number of European nationalities and Brazilians, among others, are also in the mix. 
Toronto is establishment. Vancouver is hipper, looser, livelier and more relaxed. 
Ian Hanomansing, the anchor of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation's main evening news program -- which, significantly, was moved to Vancouver last year -- said he remembered going to hockey games in Toronto and finding the stadium full of "a lot of middle-aged men, a lot of suits."
When Mr. Hanomansing , who grew up and went to school and college in New Brunswick and Nova Scotia, moved to Vancouver more than a decade ago, he was stunned by the difference in the ambiance at the hockey arena.
"It was a shock to see such a different crowd: young people, and much more ethnically diverse," he said. Mr. Hanomansing, whose family is of Caribbean-South Asian descent, also noted that unlike Toronto, this town certainly does not die at the end of office hours.
Heir to a West Coast hippie culture shared with California -- there is a still a neighborhood known as Hemp Town -- Vancouver is more like Seattle than any place in Canada, said Kerry Gold, who writes on pop culture and the night scene for The Vancouver Sun.
"Out here, being a workaholic is not cool," she said. Toronto is full of them, she added. She once lived there, and fled. "Like Seattle, we have a real appreciation of underground amusements and we like little art galleries and speakeasies. Big things tend to fail more."
Gay, straight or neither, people of all kinds seem to find the climate good and the atmosphere tolerant, residents say. Ms. Gold tells the story of an Indian who spends part of the year on traditional fishing grounds with his tribe and the rest of the time performing as a well-known drag queen.
And then there is absinthe. The drink that addled the brains of 19th-century European intellectuals is enjoying a revival here. "Absinthe is very big in Vancouver," said Ms. Gold, the city's unofficial night owl. "It's been big for a year."
Among the places to find the drink in abundance is an underground restaurant called the Hunger Hut, which technically does not exist -- no license -- but where it takes six months to get a reservation.
Toronto has banks. Vancouver has money. Real estate prices are the highest in Canada, in part because of the influx of money from Taiwan and then Hong Kong in the mid-1990's, when that former British colony was facing a return to Chinese rule and people felt uncertain about the future. But affluence, or at least a love of spending, seems to cut across ethnic lines.
The downside is that clubs catering to this spoiled crowd are pushing old bistros out of existence.
Ms. Gold, in an interview in a coffeehouse where the chairs are still upside down on the table tops at noon and nobody was moving much, said that when she ventured out in daylight, she saw many of what she called "a mean generation" tooling around fashionable neighborhoods in S.U.V.'s.
"Who are all these people?" she asked. "Don't they have jobs?"
No, actually.
James Ho, who owns a predominantly Chinese-language radio station, CHMB, and is bidding to open Vancouver's first multiethnic television channel, said in an interview in his boardroom that certainly among Asian-Canadians, many rich people merely use the city, framed by snow-covered mountains and blue Pacific straits, as a part time suburban residence.
They are not the working-class Chinese of Toronto or other Canadian cities, or even of Vancouver's older, economically depressed downtown Chinatown.
"We have a lot of people who really don't have to work -- literally," he said. "There are a lot of self-made millionaires. A lot of them spend their summers in Vancouver and the winter in the Far East."
They are, he added, big consumers. They buy luxury goods. They travel a lot. They invest.
Some families from Hong Kong, feeling more confident of that city's future, have been returning there, often leaving their children in schools here, and in big houses with little supervision and a lot of money to spend.
"Kids are much more internationalized," said Mr. Ho, who came here from Taiwan for schooling while still in his teens and never left. Interest in Asian cultures is strong among the young, often born in Canada -- stronger than among older immigrants, who felt the need to conform to a Europeanized Canadian mainstream, he said.
"But they're not just studying their own culture," he said. "They're also comparing, accepting, exploring."
Mr. Hanomansing, the CBC news anchor, said that, unique in Canada, Vancouver's immigrants over a decade or more have been arriving "with money and with the ability to go right into the mainstream." He calls Vancouver "nonchalantly diverse" as a result.
Charlie Cho, a radio producer and editor of an Asian-Canadian cultural magazine, Rice Paper, said a confident younger generation in Vancouver could reject the old, earnest credos of multiculturalism.
"At this stage it's all this big exciting thing," he said, "in which we're less interested in preserving culture or talking about heritage and all that sort of stuff. What we find really interesting is that contemporary culture is a hybrid." 
Mr. Cho was among those who last year turned Rice Paper from a magazine with academic overtones to an irreverent, pan-Pacific publication that now bears as its subtitle "A Slanted Point of View."
Another Vancouver magazine, a new Asian-inspired publication called Banana, says it chose its name to signify something yellow on the outside and white inside.
This year Mr. Cho, who was born in British Columbia, teamed up with Alexis Mazurin, an Afro-Canadian, and J. J. Lee, whose background is Asian, to create a CBC radio program called "Pass the Mike." 
"We wanted to move diverse programming beyond the standard multicultural feel-good kind of stuff to something with a bit more contemporary edge," Mr. Cho said. "So we created a program that looked at interesting contact points between different cultures."
They ride city buses. They set up their mikes at places like the Lion's Den, a Caribbean-Japanese restaurant. They scorn traditional ethnicity. "We can't have a chopsticks motif," Mr. Lee said. "We're not going to start with dim sum."
They are now putting together an ambitious show about ethnic humor, "Schtick, Spiel and Spin," which will feature three wildly different comedians: a black woman, an indigenous Canadian and a Chinese comic. They're going to record it at a gay cafe with attitude, and an appropriate name. It's called Elbow Room.

HEADLINE: Economy Puts Schools in Tough Position 

BYLINE:  By JACQUES STEINBERG 

DATELINE: SANTA ANA, Calif., Nov. 19 

 BODY:
Nearly all 600 students at Carl Harvey Elementary School arrive for class for the first time speaking Spanish, not English, which is why the school's three-hour after-school literacy classes have been so critical.
 But with substantial budget cuts coming from the state and the local district, and the prospects of federal help uncertain, Harvey Elementary's principal has already projected that after-school enrollment will have to be cut in half, if not more, by next fall. 
 "There was a window of opportunity here," the principal, Christine J. Anderson, said of the classes, which the school has given for the last two years, "and that is closing."
Having capitalized on a swelling economy to initiate new programs aimed at improving student performance, schools across the country like Harvey Elementary are now being asked to curtail those very efforts because of the nation's shrinking economy. In response to budget cuts, schools from New York to California are undertaking such measures as increasing class sizes, trimming bonuses for good teachers, putting off purchases of faster computers, postponing monetary rewards for high test scores and, as is the case here, scaling back after-school classes. 
For the schools, the timing could not be worse: at the very moment that states and school districts are demanding greater academic performance, particularly by insisting that students make the grade on an array of new standardized tests, the states are asking students and teachers to make do with less. 
In New York City, where a substantial part of a $400 million school budget shortfall is a result of tax losses since Sept. 11, administrators have pared Saturday sessions for struggling students, extra training for thousands of new teachers and art classes.
In Las Vegas, which has one of the nation's fastest-growing school systems, district officials have cut alternative education programs for elementary school students with disciplinary problems. 
School administrators in Fairfax County, Va., have delayed some textbook purchases and placed limits on teachers' salary increases, all to help the state absorb an estimated $80 million in education budget cuts. In Memphis, schools have been told to prepare to delay all but the most pressing classroom repairs, as the state government tries to wean itself from dependence on dwindling sales tax revenues.
In California, which was already experiencing a costly electrical power shortage before the economy turned downward, Gov. Gray Davis on Nov. 14 announced plans to delay support for poorly performing schools, cut assistance for novice teachers and reduce after-school programs like those here in Santa Ana, which is among the poorest districts in the nation. Those cuts are expected to exceed $800 million.
All told, the Education Commission of the States, a nonpartisan research organization, has identified education cuts of more than $3 billion in at least 15 states. Those are among the cuts detailed in another report, by the Council of Great City Schools, a coalition of the 60 biggest districts. 
"It's the poor schools that are so badly hit," said Delaine Eastin, the superintendent of education in California. "They were starved for a quarter-century. They were just starting to come back."
If there is a silver lining for the schools, it is that Senate Democrats have taken note of the states' retrenchment on education spending, and are trying to use the schools' plight to wring more money from the Bush administration and the Republicans who control the House of Representatives.
Senate and House leaders have been deadlocked for months over how much to spend on elementary and secondary schools in the next year. House leaders have agreed to spend nearly $30 billion, an increase of about $5 billion over the current year. But Senator Edward M. Kennedy, the Massachusetts Democrat who is chairman of the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, has called that figure at least $10 billion too low.
To buttress his argument, Mr. Kennedy's aides released their own study of state education budgets on Nov. 16, which predicted that states will spend $11 billion less on schools this academic year than is needed, when inflation and enrollment growth are taken into account. 
Representative George Miller, a California Democrat whose staff worked with Mr. Kennedy's, said, "The faltering economy is putting at risk the advancements that many states are making to improve the quality of their educational systems."
Given the realities of the economy, few districts have sought to challenge the state and local governments that are often ordering the cuts.
"What are we going to say?" said Anthony Shorris, the deputy chancellor of the New York City Board of Education. "This is a terrible catastrophe that hit New York. Our goal is to live with what we've got, and still help our students meet these new demands."
In California, the more than $800 million in school budget cuts identified by Governor Davis have jolted systems that had grown accustomed to receiving more money from Sacramento each of the last few years.
Ms. Anderson, the principal of Harvey Elementary, a wood-beam-and-stucco building that is crammed to four times its intended capacity, said she was sometimes inclined to agree with those researchers who have found that more money does not necessarily lead to improved student achievement. But, she said, the $300,000 the school spent on its afternoon literacy program in each of the last two years -- it now serves 150 students, most of them Mexican-American -- was followed by a relatively steep rise in reading scores. 
Last year, the school's students, who are among the most disadvantaged in the state, exceeded the overall scoring target set for them by state officials by a factor of five. Driving that improvement were the school's fourth graders, 25 percent of whom were found to be reading above grade level last year, compared with 7 percent three years ago.
Amy McDonald, a third-grade teacher who sends 16 of her 19 students to the intensive after-school program, said that the impact on their English in just three months this year had been remarkable. She said that her students arrive in class in the morning eager to discuss what they learned the previous afternoon.
Lizbett Mejia, 9, whose mother was born in Mexico and can barely communicate in English, said she had become hooked by her after-school teachers on a popular collection of books known as the "Little Sister" series.
"I didn't know that much of reading," Lizbett said. "Now I know how to read more."
By replacing certified teachers with local college students, Ms. Anderson said, she believes she can keep this year's after-school program running at full capacity. But when the proposed state cuts, including those to badly needed subsidies for school electrical payments, are combined with anticipated reductions in public and privately financed grants, Ms. Anderson estimates that she will have no more than $90,000 to spend next year on the program, which would probably cut enrollment in half.
"These last few years have been heaven," she said. "Hopefully we've learned enough to be able to sustain what we think works, without having the money we thought we needed to pay for it."

HEADLINE: Parking Garages Suffering From Manhattan's Single-Driver Restrictions 

BYLINE:  By CHARLES V. BAGLI 

 BODY:
Although it is unlikely there is a celebrity telethon in the works to support them, parking garage operators in Manhattan say that in the aftermath of the World Trade Center attack they, too, are suffering. 
 Business is off by as much as 40 percent in Midtown since Sept. 11, and 80 percent in Lower Manhattan, according to a spokesman for the industry. The operators say their woes are related not so much to terrorists or the economy as they are to the measures imposed after the attack, namely the ban on cars with only one occupant. 
 For security reasons, the city has banned driving alone into Manhattan at the Lincoln, Holland and Queens-Midtown Tunnels during the morning rush, from 6 a.m. to 10 a.m.
"The effect has been disastrous," lamented Jerry Gottesman, chairman of Edison Properties, which operates 30 garages and parking lots in Manhattan. 
As a result of the ban, Mr. Gottesman said, many people are forgoing trips to Manhattan altogether. Revenue at his garages has fallen by a third, mostly because of a drop-off in drivers who park before 10 a.m. At the Hippodrome, a prime garage at West 43rd Street and the Avenue of the Americas, he said, daily parking volume is off by 44 percent over all, and he has had to close the third floor of the building.
Joel Stahl, executive director of the Metropolitan Parking Association, which represents the owners of nearly 900 parking garages and lots, acknowledged that there might not be much sympathy for an industry that routinely charges $25 to park in a 200-square-foot space for two and a half hours. But he tried to put the situation into context, saying that if people are not using parking garages it means they are not going to the city's restaurants, theaters, hotels and department stores.
"Garages are only one part of the economy," Mr. Stahl said, "and let's be honest, not always a sympathetic part of it, but it's indicative of what's happening all over. We know theaters and retailers are down. The people who come and park are big spenders."
The operators want the traffic restrictions ended. 
Mr. Stahl acknowledged that it is difficult to separate the effects of a slowdown in the economy from those of the ban. But, he said, when suburban drivers give up on Manhattan the ban becomes another roadblock to an improving economy.
"We're not crying as we go to the bank," said Monroe Carell, chairman of Central Parking Corporation, the largest garage operator in New York. "We still have to meet payrolls and pay rent. We're going to take some licks this year. But some people are probably going to fail as a result of it."
Not everyone finds the argument convincing. The anticar lobby, as the garage operators refer to it, likes what it describes as the "car pool rule," a more positive-sounding description of a policy that it says encourages drivers to round up passengers.
"It's working well to reduce congestion in the city," said John Kaehny, executive director of Transportation Alternatives, a lobbying group. "Until we come up with an alternative, like putting tolls on the East River bridges and variable pricing for on-street parking, the car pool rule has to stay in effect."
Besides, Mr. Kaehny said, the rule affects "only a very small number of people." And it does nothing to prevent drivers from coming into Manhattan after 10 a.m.
Iris Weinshall, the city's transportation commissioner, said that she expected the traffic limits to remain in place at least through the end of the year, if not longer. The restrictions on solo drivers were imposed by Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani after Sept. 11 because of intense traffic congestion south of 62nd Street and the emergency conditions at the World Trade Center site in Lower Manhattan, where a number of the surrounding streets had been closed.
In recent weeks, Ms. Weinshall said, the city has reduced the number of hours that the ban is in effect.
"We're beginning to slowly open things up," she said. "Still, not all the traffic is moving ideally. If you open the floodgates, you are going to create more gridlock in light of the construction on the streets. I would love to see as many people as possible come back to the city. I'm just worried about bringing them back into a situation where they'll complain even more."
She said that the number of vehicles coming into the city between 6 a.m. and 10 a.m. is down 38 percent, although it is up before and after the restricted hours.
Garage operators, however, say there is a net loss in traffic volume, largely because of the ban and confusion about the evolving restrictions. Like Ms. Weinshall, they point to the traffic flow on the city's bridges and tunnels.
At the Queens-Midtown Tunnel on Nov. 14, 11,180 vehicles flowed into Manhattan between 6 a.m. and 10 a.m., down 3,357 vehicles, or 23 percent, from the same day a year earlier, according to the Metropolitan Transportation Authority. But there was no corresponding surge in volume on the alternative route for solo drivers crossing the East River: the Triborough Bridge, which does not have any restrictions. The number of vehicles there was up by only 891 vehicles between 6 a.m. and 10 a.m. Meaning, Mr. Stahl said, there has been a net loss of thousands of drivers.
On Nov. 14, the number of vehicles traveling west through the Midtown Tunnel was also down for the entire day. At the Lincoln Tunnel, 9,778 vehicles passed from New Jersey to Manhattan during the restricted hours on Nov. 14, down 9,759 from a year earlier, according to the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. But traffic was up only slightly on the George Washington Bridge, which does not have the ban on cars with only one occupant.
At the same time, New Jersey Transit reports that the number of bus and train riders going to Manhattan during the restricted hours is up by 3 percent, or 800 people, since Sept. 11. 
"The ban's a big problem," said Raj Pamnani, an investment banker who commutes from West Orange, N.J., to Midtown, where he parks at the Hippodrome garage. "If the ban's not lifted, I'm thinking of relocating my office to New Jersey."
Mr. Stahl pointed out that the garage industry employs thousands and accounts for $200 million a year in revenue for the city from the 18.25 percent tax on parking. 
Jose Rojas, secretary of Teamsters Local 272, which represents 5,000 garage workers, said 300 members of the union lost their jobs downtown because of the attack, while thousands of others have had their schedules cut to 32 hours a week.
Mitchell Moss, director of the Urban Research Center at New York University, said: "The suburbs need to be able to get into Manhattan to fill our hospital beds, restaurants, Broadway shows, hotels, and most of all, to shop. Yet we've created a set of impediments, starting with signs on suburban highways warning motorists to avoid Manhattan and the uncertainty of the rules about getting into and out of Manhattan."
For Greg Susick, senior vice president of Central Parking, which operates 230 garages in Manhattan, the car ban is an attack on something as American as apple pie. The restrictions have had little effect on garages in residential neighborhoods on the Upper East Side and the Upper West Side, but there was a 25 percent drop in revenue at his Midtown garages and a 70 percent drop downtown.
"I think it's destroying the fabric of New York." Mr. Susick said. "People don't drive into New York because they like to. They come here to work and shop. I think it's hurting a lot of people who are trying to make a living."

HEADLINE: On Campuses, Seeing the Military With New Eyes; 
After Sept. 11 Attack, Students Reconsider Old Perceptions

BYLINE:  By DAVID W. CHEN 

 BODY:
At Seton Hall University, some students who previously ignored the R.O.T.C. cadets roaming around campus now regard their uniformed classmates as -- of all things -- cool. Some have been so inspired that they say they may join the military, too.
 At Bronx Community College, where military service has always been an attractive avenue to win a scholarship, some students who had previously thought of joining the military now say they won't. They are too scared. 
 At Columbia University, where students have for decades shared a liberal disdain for all things military, some students say they have had a change of heart. A small group has even formed a new, pro-military organization. 
In ways large and small, the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11 have altered how college students regard the military, the prospect of military service and their peers who decide to join. The reaction varies from campus to campus, but what emerges from interviews on three distinctly different campuses in the New York area is a complex and sometimes surprising portrait of students who are rethinking their views of the military -- or for the first time thinking about the role of the military in American life.
Even with the war effort seemingly going well, few students believe that the military buildup will suddenly subside. Most say they would serve if asked, though some say they are afraid to die. Few challenge the reasons of those who do join. And while some students, particularly at Columbia, oppose the war in Afghanistan, few question whether one should be loyal or patriotic.
"Growing up, I was very anti-establishment, anti-American government," said Margot Schulman, a Columbia junior and premed student. "But since Sept. 11, I have softened my views about everything."
Of the three campuses, Seton Hall, a private Catholic university in South Orange, N.J., has witnessed the greatest display of patriotism among its students, who are generally conservative.
After the attacks, dozens of students either called military recruiters or talked to resident advisers about joining the military. When R.O.T.C. students conduct their exercises on campus, more classmates seem to notice.
"People come up to me and are extremely interested in the military," said Colin Kelly, a Seton Hall senior and economics major who is the student leader, or battalion commander, of the campus R.O.T.C. "Usually they'll say that it's cool that you do it."
Aubrey Carpe, a sophomore journalism major, reflects the changes.
Mr. Carpe said he used to worship anti-establishment punk-rock groups like Anti-Flag, "but I feel totally weird listening to that now." A fan of Neil Young, Bob Dylan and other icons from the 1960's, he finds the lyrics of protest, suddenly, to be off-key.
"It's cool what they're saying, but this is not Vietnam at all," he said. "This is terrorism." Now he says he admires the patriotism of his friends in R.O.T.C. 
Even dovish students said they were not opposed to the military, per se. Jonathan Ernesto, a sophomore business major at Seton Hall who participated in a recent event promoting tolerance called Circle of Unity, said that he hoped civilians would not be hurt in Afghanistan, and that he had developed an interest in joining either the Navy or the F.B.I. 
After one recent late-afternoon Mass on campus, Junno Arocho, a freshman from Newark, said that he was now contemplating a stint in the Army.
"With everything that's happened, it's made me think," said Mr. Arocho, who is studying diplomacy. "What am I going to do with my life? Being part of the U.S. is not just being a citizen, it's being able to defend life and defend the existence of mankind as we know it."
That gung-ho enthusiasm is less evident at Bronx Community College, part of the City College of New York. Sure, there is an Army Reserve site opposite the campus entrance. Sure, many students have long considered the military because of its scholarships.
But for many students, joining the military has usually meant exchanging the hazards of a tough neighborhood for the economic benefits of a relatively safe military life.
"I don't want to fight in a war; I'd rather go to jail," said Paul Brown, 21, a Bronx native and radiology major. "I might have a chance in jail, but if I go to war, I might be dead in 0.5 seconds."
Randy Rampersaud, 19, said that he once thought about joining the military. But because his family is of Indian descent, via Guyana, he worries that he might be viewed with suspicion. As a result, he said would serve only if there was a draft or a great need for enlisted men.
More than half of the student body at Bronx Community College is foreign-born, including 32 percent from the Dominican Republic alone. And generally, immigrants volunteer for military service more readily than the natives, partly because they are eager to prove their patriotism.
But most students sound like Edward Polanco, 26, who came from the Dominican Republic six years ago. At first, he wanted to join the American military to emulate his older brother, who was an army sergeant in the Dominican Republic. But then came Sept. 11.
"Before, I was thinking that it would be good for my resume, because anywhere you go, you say, 'I was in the Army,' they give you a job easily," said Mr. Polanco, a computer science major who works part time as a security guard. "But now it's scary. Everyone I see, they are scared. They don't want to go. My family doesn't want me to go."
For decades, antipathy toward the military has never been in short supply at Columbia, where students protesting the Vietnam War once occupied campus buildings. And in response to the current crisis, some students, particularly those active in recent antiglobalization protests, have formed a new antiwar group called People for Peace.
One member, Yvonne Liu, a junior who is a neuroscience major, said: "It's definitely something that I'm not comfortable with. It's like sending the poorest and most marginalized people in our nation to be killed in the name of corporate interests."
But Columbia is also the birthplace of another student group, Students United for Victory, founded after the attacks to support the military.
"I was expecting people to confront me and try to provoke me, because this is a college campus in a liberal city, and Columbia has a history of antiwar protests," said Lovinsky Joseph, a freshman from Linden, N.J., who is the group's spokesman."But I've never received anything like that. In fact, I would say that two-thirds of the students have been supportive."
One student who once considered joining the Navy, Carly Burton, a junior from Austin, Tex., said that a few friends had considered volunteering after Sept. 11 because "they don't want to sit back, 10 years, 20 years from now, and say, 'I wasn't a part of it.' " But she decided against it. Ms. Burton says she believes that she could contribute more to society by becoming an investment banker.
Some students acknowledge that they feel somewhat removed from the military, because they have the luxury of cocooning themselves in academia. Even so, most say that they no longer view the military as something alien and distant from their lives, and they expect that the military will be a looming presence for some time to come.
"Before, the military was like the little place in Times Square where you could sign up, and I never knew anyone who did it," said Jennifer Lynn Stermer, a junior and an English major from Manhattan. "Now, I feel -- I don't know if respect is the right word -- but I'm thankful that there are people willing to do that."

Mideast Killings Continue; U.S. Presses for Cease-Fire
Two American envoys are to arrive in Jerusalem today to try to secure a cease-fire and promote a resumption of peace negotiations. The Bush administration is trying to end more than 14 months of Israeli-Palestinian violence, concerned that the spiraling conflict could erode the support of Muslim nations for the American-led war in Afghanistan.

Macedonia Seeks Rebel Land
President Boris Trajkovski of Macedonia said that the former Yugoslav republic wanted to regain control of territory dominated by former ethnic Albanian rebels by mid-January, but would work with Western peace brokers. A recent deployment by government forces into a rebel area was intended to safeguard evidence at a suspected mass grave, not to forcibly reoccupy terrain in violation of the August peace deal, he said.

Vote Against Crime in Honduras
A businessman pledging "zero tolerance" for criminals appeared headed for victory in Honduras in presidential elections over a former teacher who promised better education. The first official tallies showed Ricardo Maduro, the businessman and the Nationalist Party candidate, leading 52.2 percent to 44.4 percent for his rival, Rafael Pineda of the ruling Liberal Party. Mr. Maduro declared victory, saying "the people voted for a profound reform." A5

A small, privately financed biotechnology company said it had created the first human embryos ever produced by cloning. But the embryos died before they had even eight cells, and most died long before that. Cloning experts outside the company said the experiment was a failure.

3 Boys Accused of Plotting Massacre at a High School
Three teenage boys have been charged with plotting a murderous attack at a high school in New Bedford, Mass., and the police said that a massacre may have been averted by their use of techniques developed after the 1999 killings at Columbine High School. The methods -- placing officers in schools, encouraging students to trust adults and disclose information, and being aware that assailants nearly always talk of their plans with other students -- were put to use this fall at New Bedford High, the authorities said.

Schools across America, having capitalized on a swelling economy to initiate new programs aimed at improving student performance, are now being asked to curtail those very efforts because of the nation's shrinking economy.

Throughout most of his 59 years, there have been two distinct sides to Michael R. Bloomberg, the mayor-elect of New York. Those who know him well say the city should expect to see plenty of both. There has been a jocular, brash and egocentric Mr. Bloomberg. There has also been a thoughtful, earnest and selfless Mr. Bloomberg. Interviews with his friends, relatives and business associates suggest that each version is authentic and irrepressible and that one is never too far removed from the other.

HEADLINE: Opposition Candidate Is Leading in Honduran Presidential Vote 

BYLINE:  AP 

DATELINE: TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras, Nov. 25 

 BODY:
A businessman touting a "zero tolerance" anticrime plan appeared headed to victory today in presidential elections in Honduras, where he opposed a former teacher who promised better education.
 The first official voting results showed the Nationalist Party candidate, Ricardo Maduro, a businessman, winning with 52.2 percent over 44.4 percent for his rival, Rafael Pineda of the ruling Liberal Party, with 23 percent of votes counted. 
 Surveys of voters leaving the polls also showed Mr. Maduro winning. 
Cheering, horn-honking caravans of Mr. Maduro's supporters celebrated in the streets of the capital, Tegucigalpa, waving blue Nationalist banners. Mr. Maduro declared victory, saying "The people voted for a profound reform."
Violence leading up to the elections -- a congressional candidate was killed Friday and gunmen shot at a political party headquarters on Saturday -- underscored the central issue: what to do with a generation of young Hondurans who have grown up with crime and poverty.
A team of international observers reported after the polls closed that the voting had been peaceful and without major incidents.
The ruling Liberal Party, led by President Carlos Flores, has had to govern through some of the roughest times in the history of this Central American country of 6.5 million. 
A devastating hurricane hit the country in 1998, killing thousands and causing billions of dollars in damage.
Mr. Pineda, 71, a former teacher and current head of the country's Congress, said he wanted "to make Honduras one big school," and offered to improve public services with money gained by cracking down on tax evaders.
But many Hondurans said they were voting for Mr. Maduro because of his anticrime program. 
If early results hold, Mr. Maduro is expected to target, in part, the tens of thousands of gang members who frequently stage turf battles and deal drugs. 
But his tough approach has voters like Cinthia Baldin, 25, worried. "A lot of innocent people may get hurt," said Ms. Baldin, a Pineda supporter. "Some young people are in the gangs because they've got no other option."
Mr. Pineda said, "I do believe that education can fight crime, and the problems like social injustice, unemployment and poor public services that give rise to crime." 
Mr. Maduro, 54, whose own son was killed by gunmen in 1997, had built a comfortable lead in polls with his campaign slogan "A Safe Future" and promises to implement a New York City-style "zero tolerance" program on crime. He has cited Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's anticrime measures as an inspiration.
Mr. Maduro mourned another death after unidentified gunmen killed Angel Pacheco, 44, a congressional candidate from his Nationalist Party, near the El Salvador border on Friday. The police had no immediate information on motives in the killing.
On Saturday, Mr. Pineda's Liberal Party said gunmen fired from a passing car on its headquarters in the northern city of San Pedro Sula, though no one was injured.
Three other candidates from minor parties were also vying for the presidency, but were expected to garner few votes.
The 3.4 million registered voters in the country -- where minimum wages are around $100 a month -- were also voting for all 128 seats in Congress and nearly 300 mayoral positions.

HEADLINE: MEDIA; 
Bear Market for Personal Finance Magazines

BYLINE:  By DAVID HANDELMAN 

 BODY:
On Sept. 11, the staff of Money magazine was two days away from finishing a special issue recommending 100 mutual funds. When the twin towers fell, the managing editor, Robert Safian, knew the monthly magazine, a publication of Time Inc., did not have the resources to remake the issue completely.
 So Mr. Safian left Money's fund report intact but prefaced it with a 12-page section answering the most pressing questions about investing, the economy and historical lessons. He wrapped it with a new black cover that asked: "What Now?" 
 That question was haunting personal finance magazines like Money even before Sept. 11. During the 1990's, the field was booming, and the distinctions among the publications were blurring. They all cheerfully advised on strategies for investment, tuition and retirement.
But the bear market brought carnage to the field. In 2001, three boom-era publications folded: the Meredith Corporation's Family Money, Consumer's Digest Inc.'s Your Money and the Individual Investor Group's Individual Investor. Advertising is plummeting and newsstand sales are faltering -- even though the editors argue that their publications are more essential in a bust.
"The late 90's was really the rise of stupid stock picking," said John Curran, managing editor of Mutual Funds, another magazine. "The environment has changed, and people have to get smarter."
The attacks on the symbols of American finance only deepened the recession among personal finance magazines. "People tell me their monthly broker statement comes, and they don't want to look at it," said Knight Kiplinger, editor in chief and publisher of the granddaddy of personal finance magazines, Kiplinger's Personal Finance, which has existed in various incarnations since 1947. "They stick it in a drawer."
As 2001 ends, according to Media Industry Newsletter, the four largest personal finance magazines -- Money (1.9 million circulation, according to the Audit Bureau of Circulations), Kiplinger's (1.03 million), SmartMoney (809,000) and Mutual Funds (800,000) -- are down in annual advertising pages, by 17.1 percent at Money to 32.8 percent at Smart Money. For December's issues alone, the declines from last year range from 24.9 percent (Money) to 56.7 percent (Mutual Funds). (Other magazines in the category include Worth, at 507,000, and Bloomberg Personal Finance, 340,000.) 
Meanwhile, even before Sept. 11, newsstand sales were hurting, the circulation bureau reports: through June, compared with the first six months of 2000, Money was down 25 percent; Smart Money, 30 percent; Kiplinger's, 42 percent; and Mutual Funds, 43 percent. Mr. Kiplinger says that many of his sales come from business travelers in airports, an audience that has fallen off.
A number of the magazines are redesigning themselves, raising circulation by buying subscriber lists of the defunct publications and trying to distinguish themselves in how they deal with the post-attack world.
The most extensive visual overhaul is at Time Inc.'s Mutual Funds, the driest and most narrowly focused of the four top publications, with no consumer or shopping articles.
The redesigned January 2002 issue has a livelier feel. It has revamped, graphically streamlined front and back sections (on investing and financial planning, respectively) and a new cover and logo by Walter Bernard and Milton Glaser; the cover line "Pick Your Spots" is illustrated with a photo of a Dalmatian.
The first post-Sept. 11 cover of SmartMoney, which is more consumer-oriented, departed from its signature typeface covers with a photo of the World Trade Center with the headline "Our Spirit Will Stand."
The point was, life goes on. "We're still going to think about Christmas, buying new cars, making travel plans, and I wanted the magazine to reflect that," said Peter Finch, the editor in chief. It is owned by Dow Jones and Hearst Communications.
In January, a redesigned cover will carry SmartMoney's rejiggered logo, which puts greater emphasis on its kinship with The Wall Street Journal, and permits more cover lines. The idea is to play up the magazine's spunkiness and its reporting. "What's worked for us in the past has been things like 'Buy These Tech Stocks,' " Mr. Finch said.
Money's January issue will have heavier paper stock, but the real shift is its aggressive response to Sept. 11. After the mutual funds issue closed, Mr. Safian tore up the next issue completely.
"We had things scheduled like best places to vacation and how the Backstreet Boys manage their money," he said, "things people don't care about" now.
Instead, he assembled an issue called "Keep the Faith: Investing in America." The December issue's headline is "Get Back on Track." Its annual "Best Places to Live" feature, forgoing the usual scientific method, puts New York City at No. 1. It also examines the new landscapes of travel, housing and investing. 
Mr. Safian says that Money's main role is to calm people and give perspective. "When things are turbulent or unsettling, you don't rush and make bad decisions," he said.
Kiplinger's has tried to reflect the same even-keel outlook by staying relatively unchanged. Its first post-Sept. 11 cover, for the November issue, was a cheerful "Time to Rebuild" with a hammer and tools. 
"I think if we were in New York City like SmartMoney and Money, we might have taken a more funereal approach," said Mr. Kiplinger, whose magazine is based in Washington. By the December issue, the cover was back to its annual car-buying guide, although there were several newsier articles.
"I'm getting calls from people saying the media is overdoing the gloom," Mr. Kiplinger said.
He feels the same way about his niche's downturn. There is more personal finance guidance in the market now than readers and advertisers can support, he said. But Long-term prospects are strong, he said, citing the retirement of the baby boomers over the next 10 to 15 years.
"I'm very bullish on the outlook of financial publishing," he said.

Nature Made The Perfect Hiding Place

BYLINE:  By KENNETH CHANG 

 BODY:
If Osama bin Laden is hiding in a cave in Afghanistan, as American officials suspect, he has plenty to choose from. The country's varied landscape and geology make it ideal for caves.
 The area that is now Afghanistan started to take shape hundreds of millions of years ago, when gigantic rocks, propelled by the immense geological forces that continuously rearrange the earth's landforms, slammed into the landmass that is now Asia. Much of the rest of today's Afghanistan was still under water, yet to be formed. 
 Rocks deep inside the earth, heated to thousands of degrees and crushed under tremendous pressures, flow like taffy. Just like the air masses in thunderstorms, the warmer rocks rise and the cooler ones sink, setting up Ferris wheel-shaped circulations of magma that drag along the crust above them.
Over time, these forces broke off several pieces off the southern supercontinent of Gondwanaland -- the ancient conglomeration of South America and Africa -- and carried them north toward Asia.
"All that stuff got rafted in and stitched together in Afghanistan," said Dr. John F. Shroder, a professor of geology at the University of Nebraska at Omaha who is an expert on Afghanistan's complex geology.
The limestones of Afghanistan's natural caves were once part of a shallow tropical ocean known as the Tethys. Organisms in the sea -- corals, clams, plankton -- were compressed into limestone. "All those limestones were produced in an oceanic environment somewhere south of present-day Afghanistan," Dr. Shroder said.
In a last mighty collision of tectonic plates 45 million years ago, India, sliding north from Antarctica, jammed into Asia. The ocean floor in front of India slid beneath the Eurasian plate.
"India is the last piece that rafted in and pushed up the Himalayas," Dr. Shroder said.
Minerals from the ocean floor, melted by the heat of the interior, then flowed back up near the surface, forming rich deposits of copper and iron (minerals that could someday finance an economic boom in Afghanistan). The limestone along the coasts of Asia and India buckled upward, like two cars in a head-on collision. 
Water then ate away at the limestone to form the caves. Though arid today, Afghanistan was once warm and wet. Carbon dioxide from decaying plants dissolves into water to form carbonic acid, and in water-saturated underground areas, the acid hollowed out the limestone to form the caves, some several miles long.
Afghanistan's fighters find shelter in the natural caves. They also make their own, often in the mountains of crystalline rock made of minerals like quartz and feldspar, the pieces of Afghanistan that were carried in by plate tectonics. Dr. Shroder says those rocks are twice as hard as limestone. 
"This kind of rock is extremely resistant," Dr. Shroder said. "It's a good place to build bunkers, and bin Laden knows that." Dr. Shroder said he believed that Mr. bin Laden's video in October was taken in a region with crystalline rocks like those south of Jalalabad.

HEADLINE: Shoppers' Solid Start Makes Retailers Cautiously Hopeful 

BYLINE:  By LESLIE KAUFMAN 

 BODY:
Deep discounts on things like CD's and turtleneck sweaters lured shoppers back to the malls over the Thanksgiving weekend, but consumers did not swell the crowds the way they did last year, and it is still unclear whether they will spend robustly enough to pull the economy from its downturn.
 Even this tepid start to the season gave analysts and investors cause for cautious optimism, however, because in the wake of the Sept. 11 attacks, industry analysts had worried that this holiday selling season could be a debacle. Stocks of retailers rallied on Friday. 
 While plenty of Americans rose at dawn on the Friday after Thanksgiving to snap up hot items like electronics and Harry Potter products, the number of visitors to shopping malls was down 8.1 percent compared with the figure on that day a year earlier, according to the RCT National Retail Traffic Index. 
The decline, while sharp, put foot traffic at malls this year just slightly behind traffic levels in 1999, which, along with 2000, was a particularly strong season. "Put in perspective, these numbers look relatively strong," said Jim Martin, vice president of RCT Systems, in a written statement.
For Saturday, traffic was down 6.8 percent compared with the day a year earlier, which was also seen as a good sign.
"Though traffic was down versus 2000, the traffic trends show shoppers continue to return to the malls in 2001 -- and their numbers are increasing at a faster rate than in 2000," Mr. Martin said.
On another cautiously positive note, sales in stores open at least a year rose 2.4 percent on Friday compared with sales on that day a year earlier, according to TeleCheck Services, the world's leading check acceptance company. The TeleCheck Retail Index is based on a comparison of the dollar volume of checks written by consumers at 27,000 stores, comparing the amounts at each outlet with those a year earlier.
When the sales are adjusted for inflation, however, unit sales would be flat, said William Ford, a senior economic adviser at TeleCheck, a subsidiary of the First Data Corporation. "It is certainly not what retailers as a group would like to see," Mr. Ford said. "It is also not a doomsday start at all. It is better than a lot of analysts had expected. Retailers should be pleased."
Although the initial sales numbers for the season were more optimistic than expected, there were plenty of reasons for merchants and malls to be wary of how the rest of the season would shape up. For starters, a strong day after Thanksgiving does not ensure a strong season over all. Last year, for example, the season began heartily enough and collapsed suddenly, as if shoppers had run their course in five days.
Another cause for concern was that retailers were practically giving away merchandise to lure consumers from their recent tightfistedness. Although pre-Christmas bargains have become as much a part of the holiday landscape as reindeer and pine wreaths in recent years, this year's desperation caused retailers to cut particularly deep. Whether it was a computer and color printer for $400 or CD's for $7.99 each, deals abounded. It remains to be seen whether the stores can make up in volume what they are losing in profit margins, but most analysts are doubtful.
As has been the trend for some years, the outlook for department stores seemed particularly bleak. They suffered a disproportionate share of the drop in the number of mall visitors, according to RCT. Shopper traffic for department stores dropped 12.4 percent on Friday compared with the figure for the day a year earlier and 11.6 percent on Saturday, according to RCT, and 5.2 percent compared with 1999.
If anyone was set to do more than survive this holiday season, it was the giant discount stores like Wal-Mart and Target. Their stores were noticeably the most crowded this weekend, and Wal-Mart reported sales for Friday of more than $1.25 billion, a single-day record.
"People definitely came and shopped," Peggy Palter, a spokeswoman for Sears, Roebuck said late Friday, sounding almost surprised.
Internet merchants also reported good sales over the weekend, something that could be a side effect of having fewer shoppers at the mall. Yahoo reported that the number of shoppers coming through its Web portal was up 60 percent compared with last year. Amazon.com, America Online and Bluelight.com, the Internet arm of Kmart, also reported healthy increases in sales.

HEADLINE: Treasury Chief Sees an Economic Brightening 

BYLINE:  By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 25 

 BODY:
Faced with the likelihood that the United States is about to be declared officially in a recession, Treasury Secretary Paul H. O'Neill said today that the economy was "poised for recovery" and that the outlook for Wall Street remained bright.
 His relatively upbeat comments reflected the Bush administration's public forecast that the slowdown was likely to be brief and mild. But with economists divided over the projected length and severity of the economy's troubles -- and with much dependent on unknowable factors like the course of the war against terrorism -- they also represented a gamble that reassuring words now would not come to be seen as out of touch if the downturn deepened or endured. 
 The National Bureau of Economic Research, the academic body that is widely accepted as the authority on the timing of business cycles, is expected to announce as early as Monday that a recession is under way. Members of the bureau have considered dating the beginning of the downturn to March, 10 years after the start of what became the longest business expansion on record.
Even as it has pressed for a new round of tax cuts to get the economy going, the administration has been careful not to say that the nation is in recession. Administration officials, including Mr. O'Neill, have frequently suggested that an official recession, the first since President Bush's father was in the White House, could still be avoided. Still, most private economists have concluded that a downturn began this summer and is likely to last well into next year.
Asked about the state of the economy today on the ABC program "This Week," Mr. O'Neill hedged, saying it had not met the traditional definition of recession, or two consecutive quarters in which total output of goods and services declines.
In the third quarter, which ended Sept. 30, economic growth declined at a 0.4 percent annual rate. Earlier in the fall, Mr. O'Neill publicly held out hope that the fourth quarter could still be positive, something that few economists now expect. 
The National Bureau of Economic Research does not lock its assessment into quarterly growth figures -- instead using a more flexible definition of recession.
Mr. O'Neill said the bureau "may make the declaration" that a recession has started. But he said that the economy seemed already to have recovered from the shock of the terrorist attacks on Sept. 11, and that recent data, including strong post-Thanksgiving retail sales, suggested that the worst may be past.
"I think if you look at the data on Sept. 10, we were in the beginning of a recovery phase, and I think we've moved back there," he said. 
"I think there's no doubt we've had a slowdown," he said, "but I think we will see a recovery in the U.S. economy beginning early next year and growing as we move through the rest of the year."
Asked about the prospects for investors, Mr. O'Neill said he was sticking by the forecast he made in mid-September that in 18 months the stock market "would be showing comparisons that were better than the record we achieved in the past."
An official declaration that a recession has started would increase the pressure on Congress and the administration to come to agreement on an economic stimulus package. Negotiations between the parties on Capitol Hill and the White House have stalled.

Chasing Aid: $20 Billion Is Just a Start

BYLINE:  By JOYCE PURNICK 

 BODY:
THE $20 billion riddle is hereby solved. Well, at least explained:
 The noisy but confusing argument about what New York City deserves in federal aid is not about the $20 billion that President Bush so emotionally promised. No, it is really about the $30 or $35 billion or maybe more that New York's legislators believe the city needs and deserves. 
 The riddle unraveled may sound like just semantics, but definitions in the murky world of Washington turn into real dollars.
The $20 billion swiftly promised by the president at the behest of Senators Charles E. Schumer and Hillary Rodham Clinton was to be half of the $40 billion he requested from Congress for the war effort. But only about $9 billion has been earmarked for New York -- $11 billion if the White House's compromise with Republican lawmakers from upstate wins Congressional approval. 
What is really going on? Based on interviews with many budget players over the last 10 days, this:
The White House wants to hold the total payout to New York to $20 billion or less, appropriated over time, perhaps years. And it is trying to include in that total the federal aid that the city and state hope to get from a variety of federal programs.
New York's Democratic legislators want that other aid to come on top of the promised $20 billion, which can happen only if most of the president's promise is paid with new money from the Federal Emergency Management Agency. FEMA is traditionally generous to disaster-struck regions, and in candid moments, some members of New York's Congressional delegation concede that the city could eventually get up to $20 billion from FEMA.
But here is the key to the puzzling argument: the city plainly suffered much more than $20 billion in damage, scores of elected officials and economists have said. So lawmakers adept at the Washington budget game are pressing to get a clean $20 billion FEMA commitment, plus the right to lobby for much more assistance from other federal programs. Not easy, in part because the White House never specified the source of the $20 billion.
"When people say we are not going to get the $20 billion, they sort of miss the point," said one Democratic lawmaker. "The real danger here is not getting other things that we know we will need."
LET'S call those other things Package B and the $20 billion Package A. New York cannot get both if the White House counts Package B as part of Package A. Nor can New Yorkers lobby in Washington for Package B in the coming months if they are still preoccupied with lobbying for the $20 billion they thought was already theirs. 
Package B would include grants to businesses to stay downtown; a 26-week extension of unemployment benefits (13 weeks more than for other states); an expansion of health benefits for the unemployed, and special items in the national stimulus package being sought by Senators Clinton and Schumer, including tax cuts and credits and other incentives for Lower Manhattan. 
If hunks of Package B count as part of Package A, the White House could claim to have kept its commitment. But New York would wind up with much less than it needs. 
Complicating matters are the Balkanized politics of New York. As usual, elected officials are not speaking with one voice, which is hurting even in the Democratic-controlled United States Senate, which is currently considering a stimulus package. "When the Senate sees the governor and mayor not clamoring for money, it gives them plenty of excuses not to be supportive," explained one Democratic aide. 
Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, who is surely desirous of friends in Washington as he leaves City Hall, admonishes New Yorkers to respect the president; he says the city cannot spend $20 billion now anyway. True. But critics say the mayor's uncharacteristic placidity undermines the strategy of getting a FEMA commitment now.
Mayor-elect Michael R. Bloomberg wants that commitment, as do Senators Clinton and Schumer, without whom the $20 billion request to Congress would not even exist. But Gov. George E. Pataki, in need of White House support for his re-election next year, has been silent since he was slapped down for asking Washington for $54 billion in aid. His advisers say vaguely that he is working behind the scenes.
So whither the $20 billion? New York may well, in time, get $20 billion, but not necessarily the disaster relief from FEMA that the president seemed to have promised. Call the money FEMA aid, and Congress will be free to appropriate much more. Call it the limit, and New York will have suffered yet another body blow.

HEADLINE: Congressional Countdown 

 BODY:
Congress has only a few weeks left before adjourning for the year. Yet there is still no legislative agreement on measures to boost the economy and improve protections against terrorist attacks. President Bush needs to help break the impasse on both issues, or legislators will go home covered with failure.
 Ideally, Congress should quickly pass a balanced fiscal stimulus bill aiding those who need help most without widening deficits in the years ahead. An appropriate homeland security measure would spend more than the $8 billion the administration wants and give New York City the money to speed its recovery from Sept. 11. 
 Right now there are two competing stimulus bills, and the one supported by most senators is by far the better. It would channel tax breaks and spending to those most hurt by the economic downturn, whereas the bill pushed by House Republicans would cut taxes disproportionately for the rich and for big corporations. But there is also some common ground in the two approaches. 
Congress could reach a financially responsible compromise if Republicans dropped their worst ideas -- a speed-up of the tax cuts enacted earlier this year for the wealthiest Americans and a separate measure to make it easier for big corporations to pay no taxes at all. The final bill could then focus on tax breaks, tax refunds and health benefits for the poor and the working poor, while helping small and medium-sized businesses with adjustments in write-offs for depreciation and expenses.
As for homeland defense spending, Tom Ridge told The Times last week that the nation's law enforcement and public health authorities needed more money to combat terrorism at home. Inexplicably, however, Mr. Ridge, the director of homeland security, argued that Congress can wait until next year to appropriate the money. But if more resources are needed, they should be mobilized now.
Before Thanksgiving, Senate Democrats tried without success to add $15 billion of spending for homeland defense needs. A separate proposal pending in the House is freer of pork-barrel spending than the Senate version. Sponsored by David Obey, the ranking Democrat on the House Appropriations Committee, it would spend $7 billion on health facilities, ports, borders and infrastructure to protect against terrorist attacks. The plan will have to overcome some parliamentary obstacles before it is voted on, but legislators from states with ports or international borders would be wise to support it. 
In a separate fight, New Yorkers want to add another $9 billion in spending this year for Lower Manhattan. In September, President Bush promised that at least $20 billion would be made available to help the city recover from the terrorist attacks. But only about $9.5 billion for direct cleanup costs is estimated as likely to be spent this year. As a result, New York legislators are asking for the balance to be spent on other measures that would help the area around ground zero. Senators Charles Schumer and Hillary Rodham Clinton have proposed setting aside about $5 billion for tax breaks to keep businesses in Lower Manhattan. Another $5 billion could be spent on grants to businesses, reconstruction and help for those displaced by the terrorist attacks.
Bush officials correctly point out that over the next several years the government will probably be spending more than $20 billion for emergency recovery efforts in the ground zero vicinity alone. But every day's economic data reinforces the fact that the city's needs are enormous and immediate. It would be best for an initial $20 billion to be spent this year. Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and Gov. George Pataki should get behind the New York delegation's efforts to lock up the money now.

HEADLINE: A Hunger Emergency in New York 

 BODY:
One of the first big challenges the Bloomberg administration will face is dealing with the crowds of people who are surging into food pantries and soup kitchens. The lines of hungry New Yorkers were already growing noticeably longer before Sept. 11, when terrorist attacks combined with the already faltering economy, costing the city nearly 80,000 mainly low-income jobs in the month of October alone. 
 The next statistical snapshot of the welfare rolls is due out early next month. However, recent figures from the city's two most important food-pantry groups suggest that the news will not be good. Food-distribution groups have seen a dramatic increase in the number of New Yorkers who seem to be putting what money they have toward the rent and relying on charity to feed their families. In a startling report issued earlier this month, Food for Survival, the city's largest supplier of emergency food, estimated that more than a million New Yorkers were relying on soup kitchens, food pantries and shelters to avoid going hungry. The New York City Coalition Against Hunger, which represents about 1,000 kitchens and pantries, reported a similar upsurge in demand. Unless more food becomes available, the coalition's members say they will be forced to turn away hundreds of thousands of hungry people. 
 Dealing with this crisis will require an about-face at City Hall, which actively discouraged people from applying for food stamps and welfare benefits during the Giuliani years. Food stamps, which are paid for solely out of federal funds, are a crucial tool in fighting hunger among the working poor. For starters, Mayor-elect Michael Bloomberg should work to ensure that every New Yorker who is eligible for food stamps actually gets them. Beyond that, City Hall needs to encourage individuals and businesses that have the means to replenish the shelves of the charity organizations that feed the poor.

HEADLINE: The Wrong Time to Fight Iraq 

 BODY:
The surprisingly swift successes of the American military campaign in Afghanistan have spurred talk about military action to oust Saddam Hussein from power in Iraq. The world would be a safer place with Mr. Hussein's cruel dictatorship removed. At this point, however, there are no good short-term options for getting rid of him. The Bush administration would make a serious mistake by moving to wage war in Iraq. 
 One reason is that America's mission in Afghanistan is far from accomplished. Osama bin Laden and many top aides remain at large, Taliban fighters still hold out in the countryside and a few urban redoubts, and the creation of a stable post-Taliban government has barely begun. Until these basic objectives are achieved, Afghanistan will remain a potential base for international terrorism. 
 Finishing the job in Afghanistan requires holding together the international coalition Washington has skillfully assembled. War in Iraq at this juncture would almost certainly shatter that coalition. While some Arab leaders have no love for Mr. Hussein, public opinion in the Arab world would not allow them to support American military action against him, at least in the absence of clear evidence linking Baghdad to the events of Sept. 11 or subsequent bioterrorism. The American and British governments could quickly find themselves alone in any military campaign against Iraq.
War in Iraq would also undermine whatever possibility now exists for damping violence between Israelis and Palestinians and restarting efforts toward a lasting peace. Progress in the new peace initiative announced by Secretary of State Colin Powell last week might make it easier to ratchet up the pressure on Baghdad at a later date. Moving militarily against Iraq now would hobble America's power as a Mideast peacemaker.
Diplomacy aside, the military challenges of war in Iraq are far more formidable than anything yet seen in Afghanistan. Mr. Hussein can count on the loyalty of a large army, equipped with more modern and lethal weapons than the Taliban ever had. The center of his power, Baghdad, is a sprawling metropolitan area unsuitable to the kind of special operations American troops have conducted in Afghanistan. In another crucial difference, the United States would be operating without any effective local allies like the Northern Alliance in Afghanistan. The Iraqi National Congress, the umbrella opposition group supported by Washington, is a feud-ridden collection of exiled politicians who command no combat forces.
Without ground fighters, American air power cannot prevail. The only military option with any realistic promise of success would be sending in an overwhelmingly large American ground force. It takes months to transport and build up such forces, and, unlike the situation prior to the Persian Gulf war, Washington could not count on the use of staging bases in Saudi Arabia. 
Even if these military obstacles could somehow be overcome, Washington would still be faced with the problem of putting together a new Iraqi government. The country is sharply divided between Sunni and Shiite Muslims and between Arabs and Kurds, and there is a real risk of its disintegrating into weakened fragments, easily manipulated by more powerful neighbors like Iran. 
What Washington should do now is intensify its efforts to build up a more serious internal Iraqi opposition. While Mr. Hussein's security forces are fearsomely effective, there are hundreds of thousands of discontented Iraqis. Many can be found among the southern Shiite and northern Kurdish minorities that took up arms against Baghdad in 1991, only to be abandoned by Washington, and probably also among the ruling Sunni Arab group of central Iraq. An effective internal opposition could develop into a potential fighting force and perhaps the nucleus of a future government.
Meanwhile, Washington should put maximum diplomatic and military pressure on Baghdad. It can use its improved ties with Russia to enact more sustainable United Nations economic sanctions and to press for an early resumption of international weapons inspections. More than two decades of experience suggests that Saddam Hussein is unlikely ever to become a respectable international citizen. The challenge of removing him is best left for a day when the United States can count on the strong and effective support of opposition forces in Iraq.

 BODY:
 The Manhunt

ON THE GROUND -- Hundreds of marines landed at a makeshift airfield near the southern city of Kandahar in the first major infusion of American ground troops into Afghanistan. Their arrival began what Pentagon officials said would be a period of sustained assaults against Taliban and Al Qaeda forces. A1

THE DIE-HARDS -- The deputy defense minister of the Northern Alliance, Atiqullah Baryalai, said his men had captured the city of Kunduz, overrunning the last Taliban stronghold in northern Afghanistan. While the claim could not be verified, the situation in and around Kunduz clearly has worsened for the Taliban, after days of mass defections and intense American bombings. A1

A P.O.W. REVOLT -- Surrendered Taliban troops staged a revolt at a prison where hundreds of them were being held under the control of the Northern Alliance. American warplanes bombed the prison, outside Mazar-i-Sharif, to help quell the uprising. An unknown number of people died; at least one was reported to be an American. If true, that would be the first known American combat death in Afghanistan since the attack on Taliban forces began on Oct. 7. A1

So Many Hiding Places

THE CAVES -- If Osama bin Laden is hiding in a cave in Afghanistan, as American officials suspect, he has plenty to choose from. The country's varied landscape and geology make it ideal for caves. B4

OUT OF SIGHT -- The caves, tunnels and bunkers that worm their way under Afghan soil are devilishly complex and easy to hide within. As even the Pentagon admits, the most heavily fortified parts, where Osama bin Laden may be concealed, could well be invulnerable to the most powerful conventional bombs known. B4

After the Taliban

OPIUM FIELDS -- Now that the Taliban are gone, so is their ban on growing opium poppies. Barring an unexpected turn of events, Afghanistan can be expected to regain its status as the world's leading source of heroin in a year or two. B1

BONN CONFERENCE -- For Afghans, talks in Germany this week sponsored by the United Nations could determine whether their country reverts to civil war or unites for a new era of stability. For the rest of the world, it will take longer to determine whether the American commitment to stabilize Afghanistan is real, and whether the United Nations has become more adept at peacekeeping after a series of failures in the 1990's. B1

A DIPLOMATIC WOMAN -- Amina Safi Afzali, the only woman among the 11 Northern Alliance delegates who will attend the talks in Bonn, said she hoped women would play a more prominent role in Afghan society in the post-Taliban era. For two decades, Ms. Afzali has been a leading figure in the Afghanistan Women's Islamic Movement. The talks start Tuesday. B5

AT THE MOVIES -- For the first time in six years, hundreds of teenage boys enjoyed an afternoon at the movies in Kabul. The print of the movie, "Elan," an Indian action movie, was outdated, blurry and damaged, and none of the boys understood the dialogue. No one cared. B5

REFUGEES -- Near the border with Iran, at least 150,000 Afghans, and possibly as many as 300,000, live in a refugee camp that has no hospital, no schools and no roads. They were pushed from their homes not by war but by a drought heading into its fourth year. B5

Atrocities Recalled

MAYHEM -- In the summer of 1999, in the strategically important Shamali Plains north of Kabul, the Taliban went on a rampage meant to forever drive off tens of thousands of villagers they deemed sympathetic to the Northern Alliance. The few survivors who have ventured back have been stunned by the devastation. B2

The Nation's Mood

CHURCHGOING -- After the terror attacks, stunned Americans flocked for prayer and comfort not only to their local houses of worship, but also to sports stadiums, public plazas and convention centers. But now the evidence from churches and synagogues, combined with several polls, indicates that for most people, the spiritual storm has passed -- except perhaps in New York, where the pain of the attack is most intense. A1

FULL CIRCLE -- A flag covered with tributes to the police officers who died on Sept. 11 is being sent to Afghanistan as an inspirational and emotional memento to American troops. B1

THE MILITARY ON CAMPUS -- In ways large and small, the terror attacks have altered how the current generation of college students regards the military, the prospect of military service and their peers who decide to join. What emerges from dozens of interviews on three campuses in the New York area is a complex and sometimes surprising portrait of students who are rethinking their views of the military -- or for the first time thinking seriously about the role of the military in American life. F1

The Biological Threat

THE C.D.C. -- In trying to manage what may be the most complex disease outbreak in its history, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has drawn praise for devising a treatment plan that has greatly reduced the fatality rate from inhalation anthrax. But the agency has also been caught short, critics say, by a failure to prepare adequately for bioterrorism. B6

A White House View

DISAPPEARING ACT -- While most vice presidents stay in the shadows, Dick Cheney seems to live there, especially since the terror attacks. Yet the more invisible he becomes, the more powerful he seems. B2

Business

AFGHAN WIRELESS -- A New Jersey businessman who helped set up a telecommunications network in Afghanistan in the late 1990's wants to return to be part of the country's reconstruction. C1

SATELLITE NAVIGATION -- Countries around the world are mobilizing to build independent satellite navigation networks, troubled that the Global Positioning System, the only functioning worldwide network, is run by the United States military and controlled by the government. C4

NETGUARD -- The Senate plans to hold hearings next month on a proposal to create a National Emergency Technology Guard, a force of volunteers that could mobilize quickly in the case of an emergency that threatened the nation's information infrastructure. C4

MAGAZINES -- The attacks on World Trade Center -- the symbols of American finance -- only deepened the recession among personal finance magazines. C10

PARKING GARAGES -- Parking garage operators in Manhattan say business is off sharply since Sept. 11, and they blame the ban on driving alone through three tunnels during the morning commute. F1

HEADLINE: A NATION CHALLENGED: THE FUTURE; 
Afghans Wait For Portents In Bonn Talks

BYLINE:  By DAVID ROHDE 

DATELINE: KABUL, Afghanistan, Nov. 25 

 BODY:
With the Northern Alliance suddenly dominating much of Afghanistan, the effort to define the country's future is beginning to turn from a military phase to a political one. 
 While the Taliban home base of Kandahar and the hunt for Osama bin Laden will continue to be the focus of American attention, a vast majority of Afghans will be watching negotiations that start in Germany on Tuesday and that could determine whether their country reverts to civil war or unites in a new era of stability. 
 For the United States and its allies, the rest of the year will show whether the American commitment to stabilize Afghanistan is real, and whether the United Nations has become more adept at peacekeeping after a series of failures in the 1990's.
Afghanistan today, on one level, resembles Somalia at the onset of the United Nations intervention there in 1992, a point that pessimists often point out. United Nations diplomats, armed with peace proposals and backed by peacekeepers, tried to get the country's warring clans to agree to a settlement. The failed mission eventually ended after 18 American peacekeepers were killed and dragged through the streets of Mogadishu. Similarly, in Afghanistan, the rivalries, feuds and grudges left after 23 years of conflict, when many factions changed sides repeatedly, could lead to a resurgence of civil war. 
But United Nations officials said that the amount of international attention to the country now, and the proposed multibillion-dollar reconstruction effort, is unprecedented. If attention remains focused on Afghanistan, they argue, the country can heal.
"The difference now," said Francesc Vendrell, the United Nations deputy envoy to Afghanistan, "is that there is a great deal of international commitment -- far more than there was in the early 90's here or in Somalia -- to really address these problems."
On the streets of Kabul, the people are remarkably unified about what they want. In almost pleading voices, they express an utter exhaustion with war here. People from all major ethnic groups recite the same wishes for peace, a multiethnic government and, finally, economic development.
"What people here want is a broad-based government," said Jamakhan, an ethnic Tajik, referring to one that would represent many ethnic groups -- something quite different than the current situation. "Speaking frankly, we hate these people with guns," he said.
The first stage of the political process that could generate such a government begins on Tuesday in meetings outside Bonn. 
Delegates from four different Afghan opposition groups will meet with United Nations and American diplomats for the first round of talks on forming a provisional council that could rule the country.
The council would rule until a Loya Jerga, or grand council, could choose an interim head of state and government. 
With the aid of the United Nations, the interim government will administer the country for two to three years. Then elections would be held.
One of the interim government's main duties would be to create new, ethnically diverse police and military forces.
The Northern Alliance, which consists of eight different political groups and is dominated by ethnic Tajiks, Uzbeks, Hazaras and other minorities from the north, will be one of the two largest delegations at the meeting. 
The other will be a group of Pakistan-based opposition leaders who are ethnic Pashtuns, known as the Peshawar group. Smaller delegations will represent the deposed king, Mohammad Zahir Shah, who lives in Rome, and a group of exiled intellectuals known as the Cyprus group.
The meeting will be an early indication of the various groups' ability to reach a compromise. The provisional council's members will have early power and influence in the country. The council's members will enter the grand council, for example, in a strong political position. 
Whether the Bonn meeting devolves into deadlock or quickly agrees on its membership will be an early sign of what is to come. No strong leaders exist among the many factions. Younger leaders, like the head of the Northern Alliance delegation, Interior Minister Yunis Qanooni, insist that a new generation that has learned from the infighting of the past is ready to take power. Diplomats say an agreement must come quickly.
"We have a window of opportunity that the 11th of September opened," Mr. Vendrell said. "It's narrow, and it's not going to last forever."
But the same forces that pulled Afghanistan apart in the early 1990's remain in place here. The crushing poverty that turned political competitions into desperate scrambles for power and resources still exists. Thousands of armed men who helped fuel lawlessness a decade ago still roam the countryside.
In addition, neighboring Pakistan, Iran, Russia and Uzbekistan, which all backed different Afghan political factions and helped fuel the civil war, remain eager to exert their influence. "No one has given up their traditional values and interests," one Western diplomat said, referring to Afghanistan's neighbors.
But a large difference between the current situation and the past one is the incentive being offered to Afghan political leaders and warlords. Last week, the United States and other countries agreed to spend billions of dollars to reconstruct Afghanistan. Officials privately put the figure at $10 billion, a number that dwarfs the United Nations efforts to rebuild Kosovo and East Timor. 
The government that emerges from the grand council will also be the first chosen in a quasi-democratic method in the last 20 years, Mr. Vendrell said. That popular support should bolster its power and discourage those thinking of challenging it.
"The root cause of the conflict in Afghanistan over the last 20 years is the lack of popular legitimacy of successive Afghan governments," Mr. Vendrell said. "The lack of legitimacy raises challenges, which leads to conflict." 
Western diplomats arriving here said that focused American and European diplomatic pressure should be enough to persuade Pakistan and other countries not to interfere in Afghanistan. There is also a far larger international commitment to deploy an effective peacekeeping force in Afghanistan, they said, than in the failed United Nations missions in Rwanda, Bosnia and Somalia. Diplomats said they would prefer a force similar to the ones that intervened in Sierra Leone and East Timor, but the security council has issued no clear plan yet.
United Nations officials acknowledged that if a Northern Alliance commander, for instance, refuses to respect the authority of the provisional council, there would be few mechanisms for bringing him under control. But Mr. Vendrell said the combination of funding, popular opinion and diplomatic pressure should be enough to win cooperation.
"There should be enough incentives for the Afghans to move forward and not repeat the mistakes of the past," he said. "If this is not enough, I don't know what it's going to take."

HEADLINE: Robots Learn Soccer (and the Game of Life) 

BYLINE:  By YUDHIJIT BHATTACHARJEE 

 BODY:
Tucker Balch is an unusual kind of soccer coach.
 He rarely cheers from the sidelines, and he never gets angry with his players. Instead of shouting or pummeling the air, he leans forward every once in a while to punch commands into a computer. 
 But then, his team is unusual too. The players are all robots. And while Dr. Balch, a robotics researcher at the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta, sees no great future for robotic soccer stars, his experiments could provide surprising insights into the workings of human society. 
The robots in Dr. Balch's experiments are nothing more than a few lines of software code, gradually taught to play soccer on a computer screen. They are computer simulations of physical robots built by Dr. Balch -- shoe-box-size machines that he has entered in robot soccer tournaments.
Dr. Balch plans to reproduce his experiments using the real robots, work that he says will bring his findings closer to the realm of social reality.
On the computer, the robots learn to play soccer by executing a random sequence of basic moves -- running toward the ball, kicking it, moving behind the ball, blocking it. For every sequence, a computer program either rewards or punishes the robot with a digital signal telling it whether the sequence made sense and whether it should be repeated. 
Dr. Balch divides his robots into two teams, represented by little circles on the computer screen. Robots on a control team are able to pass the ball, defend and attack from the starting whistle; the test team must learn by trial and error as the game progresses. And it turns out that the test team behaves much differently depending on whether its members are rewarded as individuals or as a group.
Under the first scheme, a reward signal is sent only to robots that score a goal. As the match progresses, every team member ends up learning the same sequence of behaviors -- going after the ball in a solo effort to score. As a result, the circles on the screen bunch around a single point -- wherever the ball is -- leaving the rest of the field open to attack. 
Under the group-based reward scheme, all members in the learning team receive a reward whenever any of them scores a goal. After several learning loops, some of the robots ended up with behavioral sequences that made them good defenders. Others in the team evolved into forwards. "Group rewarding produced greater diversity," Dr. Balch said, "and that made the team a winning combination." 
The results may be surprising to those who believe that the pursuit of individual rewards -- as in capitalism -- encourages people to develop a diversity of ideas, points of view, goals and strategies to achieve them.
Dr. Balch is not rushing to extend his findings to human societies, and he acknowledges that human complexities -- including traits like motivation and jealousy -- are hard or impossible to reproduce in robotic systems. But he says the experiments show that robot studies can serve as a window for understanding human behavior. 
"Robots can learn and plan and communicate," he said. "They are probably the best model we have right now for controlled experiments on social systems." 
Dr. Ross Burkhart, a political science professor at Boise State University in Idaho, who has studied the relationship between economic freedom and democracy, says there are interesting parallels between the robot studies and the way economies work. 
"The goal in capitalism is for individuals to make as much money as they can," he said. "Whatever strategy brings one person a lot of wealth will inevitably become the strategy used by most people." 
Would a group-based reward system in a corporation make its employees specialize in different roles like the soccer-playing robots did under the socialist scheme? Dr. Andrew Schotter, an economist at New York University, laughs at the comparison. 
"Some employees would probably stop working," he said. "You can't eliminate free riding among office colleagues like you can in a team of robots. There will always be some people who will take advantage of the fact that their individual performance does not really matter." 
If employees are rewarded individually, Dr. Schotter argues, they can maximize their rewards by specializing in a certain role and carving a niche in the organization. 
Dr. Roger T. Johnson, who studies cooperative learning at the University of Minnesota, believes that competition for rewards pressures people to become similar.
"Cooperative reward systems often encourage diversity," Dr. Johnson said, "because a group can be more productive if its members have different perspectives. They offer a wider choice of ideas for problem-solving and doing things efficiently." 
Still, Dr. Schotter said there were too many differences between robots and human beings to justify any parallels. For one thing, people don't just work for money; they also work for fun.
"Also, people don't care only about what they are making individually," Dr. Schotter said. "They also worry about how much the person in the next cubicle is making."

Sunshine for Windy Dreamscapes

BYLINE:  By MARK DERR

DATELINE: FORT PIERCE, Fla. 

 BODY:
Wind-bent palm trees, sand, surf, billowing clouds and vivid sunsets were the essentials of Florida landscape painting that emerged following World War II. Occasionally moss-draped cypress trees in the still water of a marsh presented a more contemplative view, while a royal poinciana in full, flaming red bloom or a storm-tossed shore provided dramatic relief. 
 From the late 1950's into the early 80's these colorful landscapes were ubiquitous decorations in Florida homes, offices, restaurants and motel rooms. They shaped the state's popular image as much as oranges and alligators. 
 Little known, however, is that such paintings were largely the creations of a loose-knit group of self-taught, African-American artists from what was called Blacktown in the little east coast city of Fort Pierce, about 55 miles north of Miami, said Gary Monroe, professor of visual arts at Daytona Beach Community College. (The writer and folklorist Zora Neale Hurston died in poverty in Fort Pierce in 1960.) 
During those three decades, this group of friends, relatives and neighbors produced and sold an estimated 50,000 to 200,000 landscape paintings for $10 to $35 a piece, so the paintings were readily affordable to the average middle-class white worker.
Mr. Monroe said that by the early 80's their work went out of fashion because of changes in the tourist industry and new trends in interior design, among other factors. Many of the artists continued to work, but few were able to make a living at it. Now, however, there is a revival of interest in them because of the current popularity of self-taught or outsider artists. The best of those paintings, especially works from the 50's and 60's, are collectibles whose prices now range from $1,000 to $10,000. Works by others among the artists fetch $500 to $1,000 apiece. Though several members of the group have died and others have drifted away from art, a few are trying to take advantage of this new interest. 
Mr. Monroe discusses the history and artistic contributions of the painters in his new book, "The Highwaymen: Florida's African-American Landscape Painters," published last month by the University Press of Florida. 
He identifies 25 men and 1 woman as Highwaymen, explaining that the name was first applied to the Fort Pierce painters in 1994 by James Fitch, a collector of regional art and founder of the Florida Museum of Art and Culture at South Florida Community College in Avon Park. Mr. Fitch, who was buying regional art, came up with the name from the painters' practice of traveling up and down U.S. 1 and Highway A1A, selling their work mainly to white residents as well as tourists, hotels and restaurants. Despite some objections because of the name's outlaw connotations, the painters have largely embraced it as a valuable marketing tool.
The group owes its inspiration to Albert Ernest Backus of Fort Pierce, known as Bean, considered the dean of Florida landscape painting by the time of his death in 1990, Mr. Monroe said. 
The story is that in 1954, Backus, who was white, persuaded a black 19-year-old, Harold Newton, to stop painting religious scenes and take up landscapes, which he quickly taught himself to do. Gallery representation was out of the question for black painters at that time in South Florida, and so Newton began selling his paintings directly out of his car, a practice all the painters would follow. For these young black painters it was basically a choice between work in the orange groves or another menial job, or if they had any talent at all, making art. 
A year later Backus began giving lessons to 14-year-old Alfred Hair, the only one of the group to receive such formal training, although many of the others had received some art lessons in public school. Hair struck out on his own three years later, ready to be an artist, Mr. Monroe writes. This charismatic young dreamer planned to be a millionaire by the time he was 35.
Newton and Hair are generally considered the two best Highwaymen artists, with Newton the more formal and technical of the two and Hair the more lyrical and spontaneous.
Newton inspired a number of artists, including Mary Ann Carroll, 60, the sole woman in the group. In a recent interview she recalled deciding to try landscapes after seeing a painting of a red poinciana under an oak tree in Newton's yard.
But it was Hair who set the tone for the group through the 1960's. He would tack up 20 boards at a time outdoors, then quickly lay down the color without sketches, as fast as he could, going from board to board, painting parts of sky, a tree or some other element. The essence of his paintings was spontaneity, bold colors, palm trees, surf, sand and incredible skies. 
"Painting fast was a prerequisite, not a deterrent to Hair's art," Mr. Monroe writes. "He simply 'threw paint' on his boards to miraculously achieve images that are more about being alive than about the manipulation of plastic values."
Hair drew into his orbit a small circle of friends who were similarly young, energetic and ambitious for wealth. Largely ignorant of artistic tradition, they learned from one another and spurred one another to paint rapidly and abundantly, often producing scores of oil paintings at a stretch, usually on Upson board, a common roofing material.
"Alfred was a competitive guy and lived for competition," said James Gibson, 63, one of the few members of that circle to have made his living solely through art for more than 40 years. 
The landscapes they created in their backyards or utility rooms were illusions that bore only an imagined resemblance to what existed in nature. "We improvised from something in our mind," said Hezekiah Baker, 61, during an interview in his Fort Pierce home.
Weekly they loaded their paintings into their cars and peddled them from Miami to Daytona Beach and inland to Lake Okeechobee and Orlando. They sold whatever they produced without difficulty.
Then Hair was killed during an argument over a woman in a local juke joint on Aug. 9, 1970, and much of the creative energy that held the group together died with him, Mr. Monroe said. 
The group continued to produce and sell paintings despite the recession in the mid-70's, but by the early 80's changing tastes and factors like the creation of Disney World and other corporate attractions helped reduce demand for the paintings. Mr. Gibson and Newton, who died in 1994, continued to paint and enhance their reputations throughout the period. 
Of the 23 remaining Highwaymen some stopped painting to raise families or pursue other interests. A few became addicted to drugs and alcohol. There were also financial irregularities involving their top salesman, Al Black, who was also an artist. He was sentenced to prison for fraud for action unrelated to the Highwaymen, and remains there, still painting. 
Mr. Fitch said that when he began collecting Highwaymen paintings in the 1990's, he would find them in flea markets, garage sales and garbage cans for anywhere from $1 to $450. Now the price for an Alfred Hair landscape approaches $10,000, Mr. Monroe said. 
Because the earlier paintings from the 50's and 60's are the most sought after, art dealers are primarily the ones who profit from the increased prices. Nonetheless the artists who continue to paint are gaining higher prices for their new work. With the current revival a number of the Highwaymen are attempting to resurrect their artistic careers and deal with a celebrity they never expected.
"I never thought of myself as being famous," said Ms. Carroll, who raised seven children while supporting herself as a carpenter, house painter, church musician and landscape artist. "I just give God the praise for what I got in my life."

HEADLINE: Airline Sees Sept. 11 as a Turning Point 

BYLINE:  By MARK LANDLER 

DATELINE: TAIPEI, Taiwan, Nov. 21 

 BODY:
How could Sept. 11 have been anything but a calamity for the world's airlines?
 Passengers canceled reservations, airlines were forced to cut dozens of routes and lay off thousands of employees, and strict new security measures at airports turned routine trips into marathon ordeals. 
 Yet here in Taiwan, the state-controlled carrier, China Airlines, views the near collapse of the industry as an opportunity. Its reputation has improved at a time when those of other airlines are suffering. In the cold calculus of risk, it helps that China Airlines is not American. 
"People believe United Airlines is still a target," the chief executive of China Airlines, Christine T. Y. Tsung, said. "They can also see that we've improved our performance and safety; 9/11 could be a turning point for us."
Ms. Tsung said China Airlines had lured away some passengers who might otherwise have chosen United to fly between Taiwan and the United States. She hopes these jittery converts will become permanent customers.
When Ms. Tsung took over the airline in July 2000, the situation was almost the reverse. The major United States airlines were riding high, and China Airlines suffered with a dismal safety reputation. Three of its planes had crashed in six years in the 1990's, killing more than 450 people.
Two crashes were attributed to pilot error, which raised questions about the culture of China Airlines. Founded in 1959 by retired Taiwan Air Force officers, the airline was run like an old boy's club, and co-pilots rarely questioned the actions of their captains.
"I told them, 'You don't communicate well enough,' " Ms. Tsung said in an interview. "Sometimes first officers need to speak up."
Ms. Tsung, 52, was perhaps perfectly suited to shake up the airline's culture: she is a woman, had no previous experience in aviation and had not even lived in Taiwan for most of the last three decades. Born in mainland China and raised in Taiwan, Ms. Tsung left to attend business school in the United States in 1972 and did not move back until 1999.
After graduating, she held various financial jobs, including one at Columbia Pictures, and then became the finance director of Poway, Calif., a city of 32,000 that was carved out of San Diego in 1982. The job that brought her back to Taiwan two years ago was advising its second-largest city, Kaohsiung, on its mass transit system.
While in California, Ms. Tsung kept a hand in Taiwan's politics. After the main opposition leader, Chen Shui-bian, was elected president in March 2000, ending a half-century of Nationalist rule, he ousted the top executives of China Airlines and installed Ms. Tsung.
"At the time, I asked myself, 'Why do I always get the tough job?' " she said. "It's the story of my life."
Beyond the hidebound pilot culture, China Airlines is hobbled by the China Aviation Development Foundation, a quasi-government organization that owns 71 percent. Taiwan wants to privatize the airline, but its plans have been delayed because of the global downturn and investor antipathy toward airline stocks.
While Ms. Tsung cannot change her owners, she is trying to change the mind-set of employees. She is hiring fewer pilots with military backgrounds and sending more of them to be trained in the United States and Australia. She has culled the management ranks and encouraged rank-and-file employees to send her e-mail messages.
"Putting a woman in that position was the best thing they could have done," said Jim Eckes, a consultant at Indoswiss Aviation in Hong Kong. "It was a male-dominated culture, and the guys weren't doing a good job."
Industry executives say Ms. Tsung met resistance from the pilots and the officials at the China Aviation Development Foundation. But by all accounts, she has been undaunted. And as the airline's performance has improved, her management style has won more supporters in the ranks.
With a clean safety record since 1998, China Airlines is gradually regaining the trust of travelers. Passenger traffic and cargo tonnage reached new levels in 2000, before the Taiwanese economy began to sour.
The airline lost $2.3 million in the third quarter of 2001, largely because of the falloff in traffic after Sept. 11. Ms. Tsung expects the total number of passengers for the year to decline about 5 percent.
Still, China Airlines will earn about $40 million in pretax profit in 2001 -- no mean feat for an Asian airline in the current climate. Ms. Tsung has nudged profit up by aggressive foreign currency hedging; she also hedged against rising fuel prices by buying futures contracts.
But no amount of financial engineering can protect China Airlines from the troubled American market. Thirty-two percent of its passengers and 58 percent of its cargo go to or come from the United States. Ms. Tsung said the terrorist attacks would have a lingering effect on that business.
"This was the first time airplanes were used as weapons," she said, "which was truly devastating to the industry."
Given the troubles with trans-Pacific service, Ms. Tsung considers the future of China Airlines to be to the west, in mainland China. Beijing and Taipei were recently admitted to the World Trade Organization, which some analysts say will open the door for direct flights across the Taiwan Strait.
To prepare, China Airlines bought 25 percent of the cargo operation of China Eastern Airlines, a carrier based in Shanghai, and invested in a cargo terminal at Xiamen airport, in the coastal province of Fujian.
But direct flights are a more distant prospect, since they raise issues of sovereignty. Beijing insists that Taiwan is a breakaway province, not a separate country, and a recent proposal for Taiwan's airlines to avoid flying over Afghanistan by crossing Chinese territory foundered because of political concerns.
"You have to respect your government and the issue of eminent domain," Ms. Tsung said. Once the political issues are worked out, she said, she would be eager to take China Airlines to China, noting, "We have always had a policy of following Taiwan's merchants around the world."

HEADLINE: Catching the Urban Wave 

BYLINE:  By D. J. Waldie; D. J. Waldie lives in Lakewood, on the margin of Los Angeles. He is the author of "Holy Land: A Suburban Memoir."

DATELINE: LAKEWOOD, Calif. 

 BODY:
The words "urban" and "Los Angeles" look uncomfortable in each other's presence, in the same way most Angelenos look uncomfortable in the shoulder-rubbing crowds that other cities take for granted. The region's anti-urban domesticity is its 100-year-old sales pitch, and the success of the pitch to waves of exiles from elsewhere has depended until now on maintaining the carefully planned suburban distances that separate me from my neighbors here. Even 800 square miles of cityscape have failed to evoke the loyalties that real cities demand of their residents.
 My father worked for the Southern California Gas Company at its downtown headquarters. When I was a boy in the 1950's, my father's city seemed as remote as any back East. I never felt his downtown was the center of anything, except in the noir films of the era, where Los Angeles looked like the capital city of regret. 
 Regret for the city that might have been still hangs over downtown, more durable than the layer of smog overhead that seems to begin just where the few tall buildings end. And yet, after 50 years of discarded opportunities, there are now new and hopeful signs that city life in Los Angeles has a chance of being revived.
Frank Gehry's stainless steel hall for the Los Angeles Philharmonic is warping into completion one block south of Jose Rafael Moneo's modernist cathedral complex for the Los Angeles Archdiocese. A 27-acre hotel and retail expansion of the Los Angeles Convention Center/Staples Center sports arena at the southwest corner of downtown has won City Council approval. The Los Angeles Center Studios, on downtown's western edge, has plans to add more movie sound stages to the six already completed. The Southern California Institute of Architecture will celebrate on Friday its relocation to a former freight depot along the gritty concrete channel of the Los Angeles River, 10 blocks east. The California state government and the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy are completing purchase of 38 acres of riverside land (called the Cornfield) to create downtown's only large park. New plans for Broadway, already the thriving mercado of Latino downtown, would renovate the street's pre-World War II movie houses to encourage night life.
Within the crooked square bounded by freeways and the river that broadly defines downtown, another 35 public and private projects -- some completed, others in active development -- are changing the expectations Angelenos have about their city. Three forces are driving change. Los Angeles is built out (experts here say that "sprawl has hit the wall"), and the suburbs resist more intensive development in neighborhoods elsewhere in the region: those two forces leave downtown almost the last place left to build in. The third force is the presence downtown of a new kind of developer/entrepreneur. The most passionate of them is Tom Gilmore.
Mr. Gilmore, a former New Yorker, wants to be a city maker for Los Angeles in the grand manner of William Mulholland, Abbott Kinney and Gaylord Wilshire. His sales pitch isn't freedom in the suburban sunshine, however. Instead, it's a loft in a renovated bank building and a chance encounter on a busy sidewalk after dark. This is what our urbanity will be like, appealingly noir but without the despair.
In the city's historic core -- the 200 acres of virtually abandoned office buildings from the turn of the 20th century that cluster near Pershing Square -- Mr. Gilmore and other developers hope to create hundreds of loft units to bring residential life to a downtown that has been dark for decades.
So far, the sales pitch has been most successful with singles in their 20's and 30's who are proud of living a block from Skid Row. If the economy climbs out of recession quickly, if state and federal redevelopment programs don't dry up and if the isolated dots of loft buildings become connected at street level by new businesses, it may be possible to support 8,000 new housing units by the end of 2005.
That downtown's residential population might grow by 50,000 seems minor by the standards of Manhattan. But the modest numbers don't really show the ambitions being worked out here. For the first time in 50 years, we have a chance to recreate truly urban residential neighborhoods, something that half a century of demolition and rebuilding downtown had all but erased. The challenge for developers and city officials is creating a sense that this downtown might actually be central to something -- though it won't ever be the center of Los Angeles.
It never was. But downtown can become a specialized, hipsterized district. And in time, its reinvented urbanness may set a different example of city life in this vast geography that has seemed to those who live here more fluid and hopeful and possibly better tuned to freedom than other places.

HEADLINE: Oil Prices Decline on Pessimism Over Russian Production Cuts 

BYLINE:  By Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
Crude oil prices fell yesterday on speculation that Russia would not reduce its output beyond the 50,000 barrels a day it has already set for this year, a 0.7 percent decline that is about a quarter of what OPEC wants to help counteract slowing demand.
 Chekib Khelil, the president of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, said prices "will collapse" without help from the Russians and other producers. 
 Russia said on Friday that it would establish 2002 production levels by Dec. 10. OPEC members agreed on Nov. 15 to cut back their output by 1.5 million barrels a day beginning in January, but only if nonmembers made equivalent reductions. So far, most producers outside OPEC have not made commitments on such a scale. 
Moscow "doesn't seem to want to insist on a bigger cut," said Ed Silliere, vice president for risk management at Energy Merchant L.L.C. in New York. "We have to see if OPEC goes ahead and makes its cuts without the full cooperation of other producers."
In New York, crude oil for January delivery fell 27 cents, or 1.4 percent, yesterday to $18.69 a barrel. Commodity oil prices are down 47 percent from this time last year. The United States markets were closed on Thursday and Friday for Thanksgiving. In London, Brent crude oil for January delivery fell 92 cents, or 4.8 percent, to $18.36 a barrel.
"On Thursday, you saw a big rise in London on signs that Russia would make a substantial move," said Chester Irvin, a broker at ABN Amro in New York. "That was followed by the 50,000-barrel announcement, which has us moving lower."
Crude oil prices in New York have dropped 32 percent since the attacks on Sept. 11 as traders became more concerned about weakening demand than a possible disruption in Middle East supplies because of American military action in Afghanistan.
The demand for crude oil from the United States, the world's largest consuming nation, has slowed this year along with the economy. "If the economy starts to recover just as the OPEC cuts take effect early next year," said Aaron Kildow, an energy analyst at Prudential Securities in New York, "we could see prices jump. The cheap oil and gasoline we are witnessing now would be a major reason for the increase in economic activity."
The 11 OPEC countries, counting Iraq, pump 35 to 40 percent of the world's oil. Norway, the No. 2 non-OPEC exporter, has offered to reduce its output by as much as 200,000 barrels a day, while Mexico said it might contribute half that much. Oman has offered to cut production by 25,000 barrels a day, or about 3 percent of its total.

HEADLINE: The Name of Recession 

 BODY:
For most of us, economics is an experiential fact, not a matter of science or data or even market performance. We tend, at best, to know only what we feel, and this is never truer than when the national economy is troughing or peaking. The National Bureau of Economic Research in Cambridge, Mass., acts as the semiofficial cartographer of those peaks and troughs. Yesterday it announced that the country was "officially" in a recession that began in March. That news is a little like going to the doctor and being told that the mild flu-like symptoms you've been feeling are actually the flu. The recession is real. Now we know why it feels as if we're in a recession. 
 There are genuine numbers and continuing trends behind the judgment that the economy has turned downward enough to give the downturn a name. But most Americans recognized the recession simply by the claims that were being made on their economic empathy. Even before Sept. 11, the news was full of job losses numbering in the thousands and tens of thousands. It was, and is, impossible to read those business articles, even if your own job is secure, without thinking of the individual stories they conceal, the lives and families turned upside down by the sudden disappearance of gainful employment at a time when the social safety net is considerably attenuated. 
 Certainly, this recession is just as perceptible as any of the 10 other American recessions since World War II. In a way, it should be even more keenly noticeable, because it measures a fall from what were truly dizzying heights. In normal times this would be the big news, the lead story. But these days there is bigger news, and the lead story is one that is not -- or not necessarily -- economic. According to the National Bureau of Economic Research, Sept. 11 may have worsened the economy enough to tip us into recession, sharpening existing downward trends. And yet knowing that this recession was brought about partly by causes extrinsic to ordinary business cycles seems to offset its psychological effect. That, and the fact that Sept. 11 gave Americans something else to think about, something to stiffen their spines.
Calling the current state of the economy by its proper name gives a concreteness to the felt mood, which was discernible even in the hectic flourish of post-Thanksgiving Christmas shopping -- a leading economic indicator for retailers and regular people alike. Every day the news tugs at us, implicating our reason and emotions in ways that are often contradictory. The thought of recession is only one strain in the intricate harmony, or dissonance, that each day produces. It's reassuring to know that most recent recessions have lasted a little less than a year, which means that we're well along in this one. We can only look forward to the next announcement from the economists in Cambridge, confirming the good news we will already have been feeling.

Technology shares helped drive the market to post-Sept. 11 highs yesterday as anticipation of an economic rebound next year took the sting out of word that the United States has been in a recession for most of 2001.
 "The market is clearly looking forward on the assumption of the return of the economy in 2002," said Barry Hyman, chief investment strategist at Ehrenkrantz King Nussbaum. "But the near-term news still leaves a little to be desired. It's not the clearest picture of an oncoming bull market." 
 The economy slid into recession in March, snapping a record 10-year-long expansion on its anniversary month, according to a panel of economists that dates the nation's business cycles.
That panel, the National Bureau of Economic Research, said the Sept. 11 attacks only made an already ailing economy worse.
 Hopes for an economic rebound next year have pulled stocks well above the Sept. 21 lows reached in the wake of the assault on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon.
Chip stocks like Intel kept up their two-month rally yesterday, but oil stocks slumped on a fall in crude oil prices, and the retailer Home Depot fell on fears of slowing growth in sales. 
Intel rose 81 cents, to $31.87. Home Depot closed at $45.52, down $1.06.
All three major stock indexes ended the day at their highest levels since Sept. 11.
The technology-laden Nasdaq composite index climbed 38.03 points, or 2 percent, to 1,941.23. 
The Dow Jones industrial average rose 23.04 points, or 0.2 percent, to 9,982.75, inching closer to the crucial 10,000-point level.
The broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index gained 7.08 points, or 0.6 percent, to 1,157.42.
 The Nasdaq has surged more than 36 percent since its late September lows, while the Dow has rallied more than 21 percent and the S.& P. 500 has climbed almost 20 percent.
Rapid-fire gains in the market have left many investors wondering if stocks are ready to pull back.
 "It's very possible things are getting a little too far ahead," said Edgar Peters, chief investment officer at PanAgora Asset Management, which manages $13 billion. "We have come an awful long way in a very short period."
 At least one of the six members of the National Bureau of Economic Research panel suggested that a recovery would be possible by mid-2002. That member, Ben Bernanke, a professor at Princeton University, said that based on patterns of recessions lasting 6 to 18 months, "we would expect a trough, beginning a recovery, by July next year."
Robert Baur, head of trading at Invista Capital Management, which oversees $24 billion, said: "I think, frankly, the market has already priced in a recession. It was shortly after the Sept. 11 attacks that almost all economists on Wall Street declared the U.S. in a recession."
The official declaration on a recession could add urgency to Washington's debate over a stimulus package for the economy, analysts said. Investor sentiment was also bolstered by more progress in the military campaign in Afghanistan. --------------------

Prices of Treasuries Mixed
By Bloomberg News
 Treasury bond prices were mixed yesterday as a rise in stocks pointed to an economic recovery, dimming expectations that the Federal Reserve would cut interest rates for an 11th time this year.
 "The Fed is nearing the end -- how much further can rates fall?" said David Brownlee, who helps manage $7 billion at the National Life Investment Management Company in Montpelier, Vt. "If the economy does turn around," the rise in yields "could continue -- that's why the stock market is at these levels."
The 10-year Treasury note fell 3/32, to a price of 99 29/32. The note's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 5.01 percent from 5 percent on Friday.
The price of the 30-year Treasury bond was unchanged at 99 31/32. The bond's yield remained 5.38 percent.

HEADLINE: But for the Young and Brave, Love Conquers Fear 

BYLINE:  By WINNIE HU 

 BODY:
In countless ways, New York City is not the same place that it was before Sept. 11. But that has not kept some people away from the city that they have loved from afar.
 These newcomers are the hardy souls -- or the foolhardy ones, their relatives and friends might say -- who have moved here despite the terrorist attacks, the anthrax scares, and now, the recession. 
 Unlike native New Yorkers, they were not already bound to the city by longtime jobs, families, schools or real estate. They had a choice about where to go, and they came anyway. For them, the rigors of daily life have become both a challenge and a source of immeasurable pride. 
A few are transplanted New Yorkers who are returning when they feel most needed. Fran and Kaz Kuzui, executive producers of the television shows "Buffy the Vampire Slayer" and "Angel," headed for the Hollywood Hills in 1991, but remained staunch New Yorkers in their hearts. Since the terrorist attacks, Mrs. Kuzui said, she has become more homesick than ever. She sold their house last month and has been looking at two-bedroom apartments near Central Park with her broker, Robby Browne of Insignia Douglas Elliman. 
"Physically, I don't know what I can do," said Mrs. Kuzui, who is in her 50's. "But certainly, I want to be part of it, and add my love of the city to the effort it's going to take to heal it."
Many others, though, had no connection to the city other than in their dreams and ambitions.
Damon Booth arrived here from Los Angeles on Sept. 15 to take his dream job as a talent scout for Warner Brothers Records. His wife, Angela, and their 2-month-old son, Wyatt, flew out on Sept. 10, but Mr. Booth was delayed by business and booked a flight for the next day. After the airports were closed, he drove across the country.
From his office in Rockefeller Center, Mr. Booth, 32, looks down upon the funeral processions entering St. Patrick's Cathedral to honor the victims. He hears the wails of the bagpipes. Every so often, he scans the sky for planes that seem to be flying too close to the Empire State Building.
"I feel like I've been baptized a New Yorker sooner than normal," he said. "Because of the intensity of the circumstances."
The Booths have rented a two-bedroom apartment in Murray Hill that they found through their broker, Scott Stewart of the Corcoran Group.
"I haven't had a single deal fall apart because of Sept. 11," Mr. Stewart said. "It has been really busy. People need a place to live."
In the old New York, calling oneself a New Yorker was often a sign that one had left behind small-town roots and arrived in a glamorous world celebrated in novels, movies and television shows. But now, it also means other things. For those who were already here on Sept. 11, it means being a survivor of one of the worst tragedies in history. For those who come afterward, it means not giving up on a city even when the good times are over.
"It's relatively clear that the fizz is off the Champagne," said Michael Schill, director of the Center for Real Estate and Urban Policy at the New York University School of Law. "People are much more serious and determined, and I think that is to be expected. We had a terrible tragedy and the economy is changing."
More than ever, Mr. Schill said, New Yorkers and others are realizing just how much the city needs them, and how much they need the city. "There are enough ambitious people reaching to find the best in themselves that this city will never have a shortage of people wanting to be part of it," he said. "I hope I'm not sounding hokey, but I truly believe it."
Some aspiring New Yorkers, like Margaret Crisostomo, an events coordinator from Los Angeles, have closely followed the city's recovery. A week after the terrorist attacks, Ms. Crisostomo, 29, accepted a job with the Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation in Manhattan, because she had wanted to live here for a long time. "When you read books and watch movies, it just seems like a cool, cool, cool place to be," she said. "It seems like the hub of everything."
Ms. Crisostomo, who moved to the city last Friday, said she was not sure what she would find now. "It's never going to be the same as it was," she said. "And that part really bums me out. But I feel it would still be a good time to be here and see the city rejuvenate and reinvent itself."
Just the logistics of moving to the city now can seem extra daunting. 
Stephen Collier, 30, had planned to fly out on Sept. 30 from Berkeley, Calif., to take a position as a research fellow at Columbia University. After the hijackings, though, he no longer wanted to get on a plane. He decided to drive instead, but his mother still worried about terrorists attacking the tunnels and bridges into Manhattan and tried to find a safer route for him.
"Her big plan was the Staten Island Ferry," said Mr. Collier, who eventually drove to Staten Island and then to Brooklyn.
But once here, many newcomers say they are finding a city that seems kinder somehow, and less intimidating, than what they had come to expect.
Dan James, 35, a computer engineer for International Business Machines, who is moving to the Upper West Side from Bloomfield, N.J., said he was recently invited to a party in Chinatown. Though he knew only one person when he arrived, he had made a dozen friends by the time he left. To his surprise, he said, people seemed to make an effort to mingle and dance with strangers. 
"There's more of a sense of kinship in the city," he said. "People seem to feel that they can't not speak to you, that they have to put on a friendly face."
Some newcomers like Jane Hart, a marketing executive for a pharmaceutical company, have even changed their minds about the city. Ms. Hart, who moved from Denver in late August, used to pull down the blinds and turn on the air-conditioner in her temporary housing in Chelsea to block out the city at night. On weekends, she looked at places in Hoboken, N.J., and in Westchester County.
Ms. Hart, 49, said she had been so impressed by the strength and spirit of New Yorkers in the aftermath of the terrorist attacks that now she would not mind being one of them. After making an offer on a two-bedroom apartment on the Upper West Side last month, she flew back to Denver and loaded her two cats, two dogs and two horses into a trailer to drive to her new home (the horses will be boarded at a stable in Pennsylvania for now).
"What you hear when you don't live in New York is that people don't care about anything here," she said. "That has not been my experience. I found out that they care a lot about their city, and they're proud of it."

HEADLINE: Hamamatsu Journal; 
Sons and Daughters of Japan, Back From Brazil

BYLINE:  By JAMES BROOKE 

DATELINE: HAMAMATSU, Japan 

 BODY:
Joining a flood of Brazilians lured here a decade ago to fill vacancies on Japan's assembly lines, Benedito Vilela Garcia came planning to make some quick yen then to go back home, hoping to open a pharmacy in his native country. 
 Now, after failing with his pharmacy venture, he is back with a permanent visa. No longer a temporary "aventureiro," he has opened two Brazilian schools, part of a move among 11,000 Brazilians to put down roots in this boxy gray industrial city, sandwiched between the Pacific Ocean and the Japanese Alps. 
 Japan, an insular nation that prizes ethnic and cultural homogeneity, has long kept its foreign workers at arm's length. 
But with a daunting demographic hump on the horizon -- by 2025 a quarter of the population will be over 65 -- it is changing its approach to the quarter-million Brazilians, largely of Japanese descent, who have moved here. 
Ten years from now Japan's baby boomers will start retiring, and the United Nations has recommended that Japan import 600,000 workers a year to keep the world's second-largest economy on track and its pension systems from collapsing. 
While Japan shows no intention of meeting that goal, last year the government began offering permanent visas to Brazilian migrants, turning them into immigrants and giving this country a foretaste of cultural diversity. 
"Japan has to come out of its shell," said Ivan Cannabrava, Brazil's ambassador. In contrast to the bitter colonial origins of Korean and Chinese populations in Japan, he said, "There are no historic resentments with Brazil."
"There is no desire among the Brazilians to isolate themselves," he added. "For Japan this is the unique experiment of a foreign community trying to integrate itself."
Japanese began arriving in Brazil in 1908 to work on coffee plantations. With the United States imposing anti-Asian immigration controls in the 1920's, the numbers grew faster in Brazil. 
Brazil now has 1.3 million people of Japanese ancestry, the largest such population outside Japan. The reverse migration began in 1990, when Japan liberalized its immigration laws to allow Brazilians of Japanese descent and their spouses to come to Japan on temporary work visas.
Until four or five years ago, Brazilians were here just to put together money to go home, Mr. Garcia said during a tour of his school here, a hilltop establishment echoing with the singsong of Brazilian Portuguese. Now many have come back, planning to stay.
In the last five years, the number of private Brazilian schools in Japan has mushroomed, from 4 to 41. There are two Brazilian television channels and four Brazilian weekly newspapers. 
Although Japan's Brazilian population has stabilized at 254,000, the amount of money sent home has dropped 60 percent since 1997, falling to $294 million last year, according to Brazil's Central Bank. Spending their salaries here, immigrants now tap into a network of Portuguese-speaking real estate agents and car salesmen.
"Before, they used to go by bicycle or buy a minicar -- now they all want a one-million-yen car," Mr. Garcia said, contrasting his sensible 1980's Toyota with newer $8,000 models.
But all is not smooth for new immigrants in a society that prizes conformity. At a meeting here recently for mayors of 13 Japanese cities with large Brazilian minorities, talk ranged over social problems, from cultural clashes to school absenteeism to crime.
Hidefumi Tanaka, mayor of Iida, home to 1,700 Brazilians, who make up 1.5 percent of its population, complained that foreigners failed to take seriously a municipal recycling system and a ban on picking apples from trees on the city's showcase boulevard.
There was also concern among the mayors about the crime rates among the Brazilians. Adelson Brito, a Brazilian who works for this city as a crime prevention coordinator, says there is some delinquency by the children of immigrants who fail to study Japan's language, laws or customs while working long hours in factories. "The Brazilian schools prepare people for their past in Brazil, not their future in Japan," he said. 
The new schools may ease alienation, though. Of Japan's 35,000 school-age Brazilians, only 7,000 attend public schools. Some of the mayors gathered here estimated that as many as half of the Brazilian children in their cities were not in school. Mandatory education and universal health coverage do not apply to foreigners.
"They treat you differently," Henrique Toshio, 14, a student at the Brazilian school here, responded when asked why he dropped out of Japanese school. "The Japanese don't like to hang out with Brazilians."
There are success stories, though, like Edson M. Tamada, who recalls how he dropped out of high school in Sao Paulo, moving here at 17 to work in an auto parts factory. 
Today he runs I. B. Fox, a multinational food company with a binational staff of 70 and revenues of $16 million. The key to success, he said, is for immigrants to embrace Japanese "culture, customs, language -- to integrate into the community, to create a new generation."
But for now the cultural gap is deep. 
To entertain the mayors, the Brazilian school here presented a show, starting off with a roll of drums and the shimmy of samba dancers.
"There is a tremendous cultural difference," observed Jacques Jobin, a visiting Canadian urban government expert, standing in a sea of black-suited Japanese city officials. "In that first dance, when the young girls came out in the bikinis and feathers, the majority of the men stared at their feet."

HEADLINE: Public Feuding At Pension Fund; 
Dirty Laundry Keeps Flying At Calpers, No. 1 Plan in U.S.

BYLINE:  By LAURA M. HOLSON 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Nov. 23 

 BODY:
If the governing board of the nation's largest and most influential public pension plan were being judged by the standards it sets for the companies it invests in, it might be calling for a shake-up.
 For two years running, the members of the board of the California Public Employees' Retirement System, the roughly $150 billion pension plan commonly called Calpers, have been at one another's throats. 
 The state controller, an elected official who serves on the board, successfully sued Calpers to limit its investment managers' pay -- a policy that recently helped prompt the fund's chief investment officer to quit. Another member backed a separate suit challenging the board's election procedures; earlier, he had been forced to apologize for a remark about the ethnic background of yet another board member, the state treasurer.
Relations are so strained that the 13-member board ordered an internal review of its practices. After 10 months of study, the members last month adopted a "document of collegiality" that commits them, among other things, to following Robert's Rules of Order and trying to resolve disputes informally before taking the fund to court. 
"They were almost throwing things at each other," said Richard Koppes, a corporate lawyer in Sacramento who was the fund's general counsel from 1986 to 1996 and was called in to advise the board this spring.
The bickering has sullied the reputation of Calpers, which manages retirement money on behalf of 1.3 million state and county employees, including 370,000 retirees.
In the 1980's and 90's, the fund was one of the most influential investors on Wall Street, taking sides in takeover battles and demanding more involved, independent boards at companies like General Motors; Sears, Roebuck; and Time Warner.
But the boom years of the last decade gave Calpers less to complain about, its principles became more widely accepted in boardrooms and the fund focused more of its attention on private investments, including real estate and venture capital, as well as on activism abroad. Calpers executives took to offering their advice to American corporate executives in private.
The latter shift was one more cause for disagreement among board members, some of whom worried that Calpers appeared to be losing its edge.
"We don't seem as aggressive in the press," said William Dale Crist, an economics professor at California State University at Stanislaus who is president of the Calpers board. "Our decision to be more soft spoken, more quiet -- perhaps it's been a mistake."
So far, Calpers has managed to meet its investment benchmarks despite the turmoil. But some people worry that if the infighting continues, plan participants and pensioners will suffer.
"They are too busy fighting to take care of the people in these plans," said Perry Kenny, president of the California State Employees Association, a union that represents 140,000 workers.
Mr. Kenny said that he had told board members to shape up. "I tell them it is not about your personalities," he said. "Go fight outside."
The latest sign of trouble at Calpers came two weeks ago, when Daniel Szentes, the chief investment officer, quit after only 15 months. He told the board that his resignation was prompted in part by a recent court ruling that would force Calpers to trim the salaries and bonuses of some of its investment managers, making it harder to recruit talent. Salaries range from $88,000 to $105,000, according to Calpers, a fraction of what many money managers make in private industry. Calpers officials said that Mr. Szentes also simply found the board too difficult to deal with.
The state controller, Kathleen Connell, said she started the lawsuit over the Calpers pay practices because the fund's board had not followed state-prescribed procedures for giving pay increases.
"I am a fiscal watchdog as controller," Ms. Connell said in a telephone interview. When she was asked if some compromise could have been reached, her general counsel, Rick Chivaro, who was also on the call, jumped in to answer. "There is no amicable way," he said.
Therein lies one of the board's main problems, according to staff members, board executives and outside critics. Some of the elected officials on the board are more interested, they say, in pleasing voters than in the people who rely on Calpers for retirement income, and the board members who are elected by the plan participants pursue personal agendas, too. 
"They want to make a mark," Mr. Perry said.
Dr. Crist, who has been board president for 10 years, said that Ms. Connell was a special case. "Compromise is not a word she understands," he said. "She is pretty interested in her own image."
Ms. Connell dismisses the criticisms as "gender-based statements." The board, she said, is "cordial." 
Well, not exactly. Ms. Connell is barely on speaking terms with the state treasurer, Phil Angelides, a political rival with whom she has feuded over fiscal management of California's energy crisis.
For his part, Mr. Angelides, who declined to comment on Calpers, was the target two years ago of harsh words from Charles Valdes, a board member since 1984 who is a senior lawyer for the state Department of Transportation.
In October 1999, in a discussion of investments in emerging markets, Mr. Valdes, according to a published transcript, snapped at Mr. Angelides, "What we have here is a Greek treasurer who doesn't like Turkey."
Mr. Valdes rejected a call from several legislators that he resign from the board, but he did apologize to Mr. Angelides, a Greek-American.
More recently, Mr. Valdes endorsed a lawsuit that blocked the board's plan to follow new election rules for the six board members who, like himself, are chosen by plan participants. (The remainder of the board consists of four ex officio members -- the controller, the treasurer, and two state personnel officials; two members appointed by the governor, including a local elected official, currently the San Francisco mayor, Willie Brown; and a public representative appointed by the state legislature.)
Challengers had complained for years that the voting system, which gives board seats to the candidates with the most votes, favored incumbents. Over the summer, the board proposed requiring a majority vote, not just a plurality. At the urging of Mr. Valdes, its former president, the state employees union went to court and succeeded in blocking the proposal.
"I objected to the idea because I did not think it would accomplish anything," Mr. Valdes said.
But he also had the most to lose. Mr. Valdes is up for re-election in December, and there are 19 candidates running for two seats. Besides the Angelides episode, he has been tarred by the disclosure that he accepted gifts, including tickets to sporting events. A few years ago, when he was chairman of the fund's investment committee, he filed for personal bankruptcy reorganization.
Mr. Valdes said that his critics at Calpers had no grounds for being embarrassed by his conduct. "They have their own skeletons in their closets," he said.
Last December, matters got so bad that Dr. Crist appointed Sean Harrigan, a board newcomer, to lead a committee examining the way the board governed itself. It was just the kind of move that Calpers has often demanded of the companies in which it invests.
"What it really boiled down to was there were poor lines of communication and open expressions of hostility," said Mr. Harrigan, an official of the United Food and Commercial Workers International Union.
Mr. Harrigan's committee came up with several initiatives. A protocol was established for board communication with Calpers staff members so that employees would no longer be whipsawed by the board members' competing interests. The board now gets together socially every month, part of an effort to address conflicts informally, rather than in courtrooms. Members and observers describe all this as just a start.
"It is probably not as big a mess as it looks," Dr. Crist said. "But maybe I'm just used to it."

HEADLINE: Massachusetts School Opens After Bomb-Plot Arrests 

BYLINE:  By PAM BELLUCK 

DATELINE: NEW BEDFORD, Mass., Nov. 26 

 BODY:
Classes resumed today at New Bedford High School after a holiday weekend in which three students were charged with plotting an attack on the school that the police said was intended to be bloodier than the 1999 killings at Columbine High School. 
 But even though the authorities said the plotters had all been caught, and the school was searched locker by locker for explosives on Sunday, things were not entirely back to normal. 
 About 40 percent of the school's 3,300 students stayed home, said Joseph Oliver, the headmaster. About 40 met with guidance counselors and six students, who were especially troubled or concerned about safety, met with crisis counselors. Police cars and officers guarded the sprawling, mud-brown school complex and inside, between classes, teachers manned the hallways. 
"I still feel that it is not safe at all," said Kelly Oliveira, 16, a junior who did not go to school today. 
The police and school officials took pains today to assure parents and students that the school was safe. But as parents and friends of those arrested painted the charges as a drastic overreaction, the authorities cautioned a jumpy community that they had not exaggerated the potential scale of the killing spree they believed was planned.
"In all likelihood, they would have done what they said they were going to do," Chief Arthur J. Kelly III of the New Bedford Police said at a news conference. In threats overheard by a student, he said, "they talked about how they were going to outdo Columbine, detonate an explosive, shoot students and faculty and eventually commit suicide." 
Chief Kelly said summonses had been issued today for two additional teenagers, a 17-year-old girl and a 15-year-old boy, who were expected to turn themselves in this week. The authorities, who would not release the older teenager's name until she was formally arrested, believed the two knew about the plot. 
The three boys charged with plotting the attack, Eric McKeehan, 17, and two 15-year-olds whose names were withheld because of their age, pleaded not guilty to conspiracy to commit murder, conspiracy to commit assault and battery and illegal possession of ammunition in arraignments today. All three were held without bail, pending what is called a dangerousness hearing, at which a judge would determine if they posed a threat to themselves and others and should therefore continue to be denied bail. 
The authorities in this gritty seacoast town 58 miles south of Boston began investigating the possibility of an attack plot in early October when a girl in school told a teacher she had overheard boys scheming to bomb the school and shoot students. At that time, two students were charged with making threats; charges were dismissed against one student, but the other was among those charged this weekend in the attack plot. 
Later in October, a landlord of a building where one of the boys lives reported a suspicious box in the attic. The police said they found a nearly completed bomb, but because a crucial part was missing they could not file charges. 
Then, last week, a school janitor found a note outside a science room that referred to plans for an attack. The authorities said that after executing search warrants at the boys' homes and finding shotgun shells, knives, a notebook with bomb-making instructions and photographs of the boys holding handguns, the police arrested Mr. McKeehan and the two 15-year-olds on Saturday. 
Today, parents of the three boys defended their sons and portrayed them as harmless teenagers, somewhat troubled perhaps, but not capable of the violence they were accused of plotting.
"These kids wouldn't hurt any living thing, they just wouldn't," said Susan St. Hilaire, the mother of one of the 15-year-old boys and a kind of surrogate mother to Eric and several other teenagers. Eric had been living in Ms. St. Hilaire's third-floor apartment near downtown since August. The other 15-year-old, Eric's brother, had apparently been living with his mother in south New Bedford. 
Ms. St. Hilaire said her son had been going through a tough time in recent months. Last year, Ms. St. Hilaire, a former nurse who is now unemployed and on disability, called the Department of Social Services seeking help handling her son's pattern of taking her car and staying out at night. 
She said he failed at a vocational school last year and switched to New Bedford High School, where his grades were "horrible." She said he had gotten "in trouble at school for silly stuff." The hardest thing for her son, she said, was the unexpected death of his father from pancreatic cancer in September. 
Harold McKeehan, the father of Eric and the other 15-year-old, said today that the shotgun shells and the photographs with weapons were souvenirs from a family vacation in Ohio. 
"Neither one of my children has had any problems," Mr. McKeehan said. "This is way blown out of proportion."
Mr. McKeehan said that Eric's only difficulty was that he had learning disabilities, "and he was wanting to get out in the working world." He said he had ordered Eric to stay in school and graduate. 
"He's not a monster," he said. "He's a little kid in a big guy's body."
Mr. McKeehan, who is divorced from the boys' mother and lives in the Boston area, where he is a carpenter, declined to talk about his younger son. Ms. St. Hilaire said he was an honor roll student, and she said Eric worked four nights a week at an Italian restaurant. 
Teenagers and adults who were acquainted with the three boys said some or all of them listened to Metallica and other heavy metal music. Eric liked to skateboard, and sometimes brought his skateboard to school. At least one of the 15-year-olds wore a mohawk, black fingernail polish in the Gothic style and sported numerous body piercings. But in interviews today, the boys were not branded as outcasts.
"Everybody wears Gothic clothes," said Trisha Boucher, 14, a freshman at the high school, who showed up at the courthouse, saying she was curious about Eric's arraignment. "He looks like a normal kid every day when I walk by him."

HEADLINE: Sprawl Seen to Hurt South's Forests 

BYLINE:  By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 26 

 BODY:
The Forest Service has concluded in a study released today that the biggest threat to Southern forests is urban sprawl, a finding that to some degree absolves the timber industry for the effects of a logging boom that has transformed the South in recent decades.
 "Among forces of change, urbanization will have the most direct, immediate and permanent effects on the extent, condition and health of forests," the study found. 
 The study, an assessment of Southern forests conducted over the last two years, forecasts that 31 million acres of forests in the region will be lost to urbanization from 1992 to 2040. But it estimates that the 13 states of the South will experience an overall decline of only 2 percent in forests because it expects much of what is now farmland to be converted to forests. 
Those new forests would largely be tree farms, which environmentalists say come at the expense of true forests and wetlands. And conservation groups said the way the Forest Service report was written masked the drastic shifts occurring in the Southern landscape.
Most of the urbanization is expected to take place along the South's coastline, while the new forests are expected to be grown in its western regions.
The report grew out of the increasing clash between environmentalists and the timber industry over land management and was meant to serve as a basis of information for future policy debates. It was conducted by the Forest Service, the Environmental Protection Agency, the Tennessee Valley Authority, the Fish and Wildlife Service and several universities.
"Urbanization is the most immediate threat," said David N. Wear, a forest economics researcher for the Forest Service based in Research Triangle Park, N.C., and an author of the report.
The report also cited other factors, including pine beetle infestation and ozone pollution. Given the magnitude of the tree harvesting and changes in the environment, Mr. Wear said, "sustainability is not a foregone conclusion. It's not just going to happen; we need to make it happen."
Timber industry officials greeted the report as a vindication. They said it confirmed that they were managing forests carefully and showed that environmentalists had exaggerated problems caused by the industry as opposed to those caused by sprawl.
"The findings echo what our knowledge and experience has told us: that urbanization is a problem for forests," said Michael Klein, a spokesman for the American Forest and Paper Association.
He said the industry planted more than a billion new trees in the South each year. "We harvest trees, but it's in our best interest to make sure we replant them," he said. "Our livelihood is in the South. If there's a problem with sustainability, we need to know about it. We're pleased to see that there aren't a lot of problems."
But Lark Hayes, a lawyer for the Southern Environmental Law Center, based in Chapel Hill, N.C., said that while urbanization was clearly a factor in the destruction of forests, there were other major threats as well, particularly by what she called the "massive conversion" of forestland to pine tree plantations.
Such plantations, Ms. Hayes said, often involved the use of herbicides to reduce competing vegetation and supported less diverse species.
The industry likes the plantations because they grow quickly and generate quick revenue. Pine plantations in the South grew to 32 million acres in 1999 from 2 million acres in 1953. The study forecasts that pine plantations will keep expanding, to 54 million acres in 2040, while all other forest types decline.
The land expected to become pine plantations by 2040, Ms. Hayes said, is equivalent to the size of North and South Carolina combined. She said the report failed to discuss why tree farms were detrimental.
"It talks about imperiled critters, but it stops short of connecting the dots between the levels of timber harvest and tree farms and the declines in those species," she said.
Jon Evans, a professor of biology at the University of the South, in Sewanee, Tenn., said, "The report raises a number of red flags about the future of Southern forests."
He said the South was home to the highest number of endangered ecosystems and was experiencing the sharpest shifts in land use of any region in the country.
The South is now the nation's leading paper producer, providing nearly 60 percent of the wood supply.
Timber companies say the shift from the Pacific Northwest to the South occurred because of better growing conditions; environmentalists say that Southern landowners have encouraged the expansion by allowing the timber industry to use their forests, which, unlike those West, are primarily on private land.
In the last 50 years, the South's timber production has more than doubled and its share of world production has climbed from 6.3 percent to 15.8 percent. Timber is a major underpinning of the once-agrarian South, accounting for 6 percent of the jobs and 8 percent of the income. The South now produces more timber than any country in the world.
The study said the presence of imperiled animal species were cause for concern. And because nonfragmented swaths of forest are increasingly rare, it said, they have a disproportionately high ecological value.
As the South's population continues to rise, so will urbanization, the report noted, threatening the habitats of the 1,208 vertebrate species known to exist in the South, 132 of which are already of conservation concern and 28 of which are classified as imperiled.

HEADLINE: Nassau Democrats Form Plan to Cut Spending and Raise Taxes 

BYLINE:  By BRUCE LAMBERT 

DATELINE: GARDEN CITY, N.Y., Nov. 26 

 BODY:
Facing a Wednesday deadline to balance Nassau County's budget or risk a state fiscal takeover, the County Legislature's Democratic majority agreed tonight on a package of spending cuts and a 15 percent increase in the county property tax. The increase would cost homeowners about $150 a year.
 But the budget for 2002 faces two more major hurdles: approvals by County Executive Thomas S. Gulotta and by the special state monitoring agency that oversees Nassau's finances. 
 A spokesman for Mr. Gulotta, a Republican who is retiring at the end of the year, said, "The county executive will review every aspect of the County Legislature's tax increase budget with the goal of cutting spending before consideration of additional tax increase." 
The size of the increase heightened the chance that he would veto it, as he did a 15.4 percent increase last fall. If he does, the Democrats do not have enough votes to override him, and such a stalemate could trigger a state takeover. 
Democrats say they hope to persuade Mr. Gulotta to support the tax increase to avoid what they say would be an even worse end to his career: giving control of the county to the state fiscal agency. 
For years Mr. Gulotta has resisted tax increases. That practice, coupled with his reluctance to curb spending, helped plunge Nassau into large deficits. The deficits in turn forced the county to seek a state bailout and accept the imposition of the state oversight agency, the Nassau County Interim Finance Authority, known as NIFA.
Mr. Gulotta and the legislators had already agreed to a 5 percent increase in the county portion of the property tax -- equal to about $1 a week for the average homeowner -- for each of the next three years.
But the next county executive, Thomas R. Suozzi, a Democrat, has lobbied behind the scenes to accelerate the three annual tax increases into the first year. That was the same ploy he used in rectifying a deficit in the small city of Glen Cove when he took over as mayor there in 1994. 
"So this is the Suozzi plan!" the legislature's Republican minority leader, Peter Schmitt, said. "You're imposing a larger tax increase than NIFA would require. This is ridiculous."
But the presiding officer, Judith A. Jacobs, a Democrat, said the plan would give the county "a stronger foundation" so that it "would not be on the verge of bankruptcy every time we turn around."
The state oversight agency, which set the Wednesday deadline, is planning its own meeting around Dec. 7. When Mr. Gulotta proposed his $2.2 billion budget for 2002, the state monitors found it out of balance by $55 million. The legislature then made revisions, but the monitors said the changes still fell short by about $45 million.
The Democrats say they believe their latest plan will win the agency's approval. Although they outlined the plan at a public meeting tonight, the formal paperwork was not ready for a vote until after midnight.
The new plan cuts sales tax estimates by $10 million because of the shaky economy, lowers estimated savings from job attrition by $8 million and reduces police spending by $7 million, mostly by eliminating a class of recruits. The plan also adds $1 million to pay county workers called up in the reserves and $1.2 million to give volunteer firefighters a partial tax break.
Mr. Suozzi issued a statement saying, "Nassau County is in the worst financial crisis of its history."
Furthermore, he said, "There is a looming recession and we still don't know the full impact on the economy of the September terrorist attacks.
"It's imperative that the legislature approves a solidly balanced budget that meets NIFA's scrutiny and is passed by the current county executive."
A spokesman for Mr. Gulotta, John Zaher, issued a comment on the budget that concluded, "Due to the fact the county executive will review the budget with the fiscal integrity of the county and the interest of the taxpayers foremost in mind, he cannot comment until he has received the final budget adopted by the legislature."

To the Editor:
Re "A Hunger Emergency in New York" (editorial, Nov. 26):
Food pantries are indeed overflowing with pleas for help. 
Unemployment in New York City has dramatically increased over the last year. And the city's homeless shelters are beyond capacity, with more than 12,000 children languishing in often squalid and overcrowded conditions.
 These problems -- worsened by the attacks of Sept. 11 and a serious economic downturn -- will surely continue until we find ways to address the root causes of poverty and homelessness. 
 We still cannot ignore our affordable-housing crisis, or our serious need to ensure access to high-quality health care, education and real job training and skill building. But it requires government to be a partner in the larger antipoverty struggle, something that's been absent in the past.

HEADLINE: Gas-Guzzling in a Patriotic Age 

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Robert F. Kennedy Jr. ("Better Gas Mileage, Greater Security," Op-Ed, Nov. 24) may be right that reduced gasoline consumption should be a national goal. 
But I disagree with his proposal for how to achieve it.
 Command-and-control solutions like the corporate average fuel economy, or CAFE, standards are rarely the best approach to correcting decisions made in a free market. Such regulation not only is intrusive but also gives insufficient incentive to car makers once the standard is met and gives no incentive for car owners to drive less. 
 It would be better to use a corrective tax, like the tax on gasoline. A higher gasoline tax could be coupled with lower income taxes. Politically this should be a win-win proposition, for it would appeal to Democratic environmentalists and Republican supply-siders, as well as those who believe that dependence on foreign oil is a threat to national security.

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Robert F. Kennedy Jr. (Op-Ed, Nov. 24) presents a convincing argument for legislation holding sport utility vehicles and minivans to the fuel economy standard for cars. 
He proposes that Congress raise the standards for all cars to 40 miles a gallon by 2012.
 But why do we need Congressional action? Why aren't American automakers meeting these standards now, or at least in the next two or three years? The technology already exists, as the Toyota Prius hybrid family-size car demonstrates, with 48 miles per gallon according to the Environmental Protection Agency. 
 Congress deserves criticism for its lack of action. But American auto companies deserve even greater criticism. And the news media, by not pushing our automakers to find out why they are ignoring their environmental and patriotic duties, disappoint all of us interested in an active and free press.

To the Editor:
Robert F. Kennedy Jr. (Op-Ed, Nov. 24) notes the threat to our national security caused by our reliance on fossil fuels. 
This vulnerability cannot be solved by more domestic production. That's why any credible energy plan must steadily reduce our fossil fuel consumption. Increasing the fuel economy standard would be a useful initial step.
 Beneficial energy plans would include measures to nurture energy resource diversity, promote energy efficiency and conservation, and ensure that the full social and environmental costs of energy use are included in its cost. 
 The alternative is a future featuring increased price shocks, greater reliance on foreign energy sources, mounting social inequality and more severe impacts from climate change.

 BODY:
 On the Ground

THE MARINES -- Just hours after establishing a base southwest of Kandahar, the Taliban stronghold, American marines helped direct air attacks on an armored column, inaugurating a new phase in the war that the Pentagon said would deploy 1,000 ground troops. A1

MILITARY ANALYSIS -- The dispatch of hundreds of American marines to an airfield near Kandahar is a calculated gamble intended to take the fight to southern Afghanistan, where the Taliban's support is greatest. B1

IN KUNDUZ -- As Taliban soldiers fled this northern city, they left behind several mysteries, among them the nature of several flights into the airport before the city fell. A1

TRIBAL GAINS -- As United States marines secured their position near Kandahar, anti-Taliban tribal groups made gains that deepened the Taliban's isolation in southern Afghanistan and cut off their main access points to Pakistan. B3

WILD HIGHWAYMEN -- Bus drivers traveling in southern Afghanistan describe the region as being ruled by wayward gunmen and local rulers beholden to no one. B3

The Fortress Battle

P.O.W. REVOLT -- Surrendered Taliban soldiers being held in a fort outside Mazar-i-Sharif were engaged in a fierce battle with the American-backed troops of the Northern Alliance. Five Americans were wounded trying to quell the uprising after they called in a bombing mission and the bomb exploded too close to them.. A1

PAKISTAN REACTS -- The spokesman for the Pakistan Foreign Ministry, Aziz Ahmed Khan, said the government would seek a complete report on the prison revolt that was believed to have killed many Pakistanis who had fought with the Taliban. B4

The Coalition

RUSSIA RETURNS -- Twelve Russian military cargo planes carrying equipment and troops landed at an airbase outside Kabul, in what President Vladimir V. Putin called a new stage in Russia's cooperation with the American-led anti-Taliban coalition. B3

IN LONDON -- Defense Secretary Geoff Hoon told Parliament that there was "absolutely no truth" to accounts of differences between Britain and the United States over how the war in Afghanistan was being conducted. B4

IN GERMANY -- The president of the Northern Alliance, Burhanuddin Rabbani, played down hopes of a breakthrough at a conference aimed at organizing a broadly based and representative government to replace the Taliban. He called the conference, which starts in Bonn today, a preliminary meeting of most of the key Afghan factions. B2

Questions of Security

FOREIGN PASSENGERS -- The United States has told Saudi, Russian, Chinese and other foreign airlines that their passengers arriving in this country will be put through extremely rigorous, lengthy searches, starting Thursday, if the airlines do not provide information needed to identify potential terrorists. A1

THE INTERVIEWS -- Instead of knocking on doors, Michigan authorities will send letters today to hundreds of young Middle Eastern men who have come to the United States on temporary visas in the last two years, inviting them to make appointments for interviews regarding the terror attacks. Critics have said the Department of Justice order to canvass 5,000 such visitors unfairly targets people based on religion or nationality and is too time-consuming for many local police departments. A1

DETAINED -- A Palestinian professor, Mazen Al-Najjar, who was held in custody for more than three and a half years on secret evidence, was jailed again this weekend in Florida after an appeals court ruled that the government could deport him. B7

SMALLPOX -- Should smallpox occur in the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will recommend isolating victims and vaccinating a "containment ring" of people exposed to an infected patient rather than mass vaccinations. B7

LEAHY LETTER -- Forensic scientists and F.B.I. agents in full protective gear and in a sealed laboratory will open the anthrax-contaminated letter addressed to Senator Patrick J. Leahy. They do not expect to open the letter before Thursday, because of fears of losing or damaging evidence. B8

IN CONNECTICUT -- Dozens of additional samples taken near the home of Ottilie W. Lundgren, the 94-year-old woman who died of inhalation anthrax last week, all tested negative for the bacteria. B8

Warning Iraq

WEAPONS INSPECTIONS -- President Bush warned Saddam Hussein that if he did not allow United Nations inspectors into Iraq to determine if the country was developing nuclear, chemical or biological weapons, he would face consequences. When asked what those might be, Mr. Bush said, "He'll find out." A1

Suspicions and Suspects

STRAINED RELATIONS -- Saudi Arabia is balking at American requests to freeze the bank accounts of those the United States says are linked to terrorism, saying the Americans have not offered proof that the individuals and businesses named are linked to terrorism. The Bush administration is sending a delegation to Riyadh to discuss the standoff. B1

DEFENDING THE TALIBAN -- Before Sept. 11, the most vocal advocate in the United States for the Taliban was Laili Helms, a 38-year-old Afghan-American. Since the attacks, Ms. Helms has lived under siege in her house in New Jersey. B6

IN SPAIN -- Police officers carrying out surveillance of two Islamic terror cells tied to Osama bin Laden saw the groups' leaders talking on a Madrid street two weeks before Sept. 11. The police believe the meeting was a furtive attempt to coordinate the groups' actions. B6

IN BRUSSELS -- Belgian and French police detained 14 people suspected of being involved in the plot to assassinate Ahmed Shah Massoud, the leader of Afghanistan's Northern Alliance who was killed Sept. 9. B6

The Aftermath in New York

COMPENSATION FUND -- Kenneth R. Feinberg, a Democratic lawyer, was appointed to run the federal fund set up to compensate the families of victims in the terror attacks. B1

COMINGS -- The terror attacks, the anthrax scares, the recession -- none have kept some people from moving to New York. D1

GOINGS -- Plenty of anecdotal reports suggest that many people, particularly with young children, are leaving the city or at least began considering it after Sept. 11. D1

Science Times

BIOTERROR -- Government officials, ethicists and scientists are grappling with whether the nation's biologists and biotechnology companies should be regulated to restrict access to information and materials that might be used for biological weapons. F1

SMALLPOX VIRUS -- Some biological weapons experts fear that terrorists have already gotten hold of the smallpox virus, while others say a sophisticated adversary could make it from scratch. F6

HEADLINE: National Briefing West: Hawaii: Tourism Suffers After Attacks 

BYLINE:  By Michele Kayal (NYT) 

 BODY:
 The number of visitors to Hawaii fell more than 30 percent in the first full month after Sept. 11, putting the state's year-to-date figures 7 percent behind those of last year. 
Visitors from Japan were the scarcest, with 54 percent fewer than in the previous October. Tourism accounts for a quarter of Hawaii's economy, and analysts estimate that a 30 percent drop for the fourth quarter could cost the state 25,000 jobs and $1 billion. The state will spend an additional $10 million on marketing through March to try to stem the drop. Michele Kayal (NYT)

HEADLINE: Top Companies Issuing Debt At a Fast Pace 

BYLINE:  By STEPHANIE STROM 

 BODY:
In the weeks since the attack on the World Trade Center, blue-chip corporations have issued a torrent of debt.
 Ford, General Electric, I.B.M., Kraft, AT&T, General Motors and other companies have doubled and even trebled their initial plans for bond offerings as investors, disenchanted with the stock market, have all but begged to buy their debt. In all, companies have issued 31.5 percent more debt in the last 11 weeks than they did in the period a year earlier. 
 The companies are taking advantage of the chance to raise cash at bargain basement prices, thanks to low interest rates, and to retire more expensive debt.
But they may also have little-discussed concerns that money will be scarce in the future, particularly if the economic downturn persists and the recovery is less vigorous than economists now hope. Bank lending is at a 30-year low, according to the Conference Board, and buyers are hard to find for commercial paper, the short-term, cheap debt that corporate purebreds rely on. Standard & Poor's says the amount of commercial paper issued by nonfinancial companies has shrunk roughly 30 percent this year. 
"Companies now can lock in substantially lower overall borrowing costs," said William Cunningham, director of credit strategy at J. P. Morgan. "They have an opportunity to build a war chest to help them get through the hard times, and they're taking advantage of it."
Before the terrorist attacks, analysts were expecting the issuing of debt to slow late this year after a tremendous first half.
So much for expectations. Ford originally planned to raise $3 billion; it was able to raise $9.4 billion and is said to be thinking about trying to raise $7 billion more.
Kraft Foods, part of the Philip Morris Companies, had planned to issue $2 billion worth of bonds. Instead, it offered $4 billion.
AT&T raised $10.1 billion, twice as much as it originally planned. AT&T's and Ford's issues rank as the second- and third-largest ever.
All told, 573 corporations have issued $181 billion of debt since Sept. 11, compared with 692 companies that raised $138 billion in the period last year, according to Thomson Financial/First Call.
"When you look at other asset classes, the corporate bond market offers some of the better values," said Bob LoBue, head of the investment-grade fixed-income syndicate at J. P. Morgan, which has underwritten roughly half the issues that have come to market since Sept. 11. "There's still a lack of confidence in stock valuations based on the weakness we're seeing in earnings."
Issuers and their underwriters most often cite the low interest rates on Treasury bills as the reason for the surge in corporate debt. Corporate bonds are often priced in relation to United States government debt, and thanks to a cascade of interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve this year, well-heeled companies can borrow at extremely attractive rates.
International Business Machines, for instance, recently sold $1.5 billion worth of five-year notes with the lowest coupon it has ever issued, 4.875 percent.
Others, though, read the stampede of premier companies to issue debt as a sign that credit is getting tight. Investment-grade companies typically juggle a smorgasbord of debt -- short, intermediate and long term -- but they are definitely skewing the mixture toward the long end these days. No doubt, that is because debt is cheap -- but it also suggests that they may foresee a time when money will be more scarce and are accumulating the war chests Mr. Cunningham referred to.
It was not so long ago, after all, that companies experienced a credit shortage. "A credit crunch was brewing last year," Mr. Cunningham said, "until the Fed stepped in and started aggressively lowering interest rates, which averted it."
But a cash problem persists in some ways despite the Federal Reserve's series of interest rate cuts. "We are in a cash crisis like none we have experienced in recent memory," said James Padilla, a Ford executive, in a recent memorandum to his staff.
Many companies with less-than-pristine credit ratings have trouble raising money and may be having more because of the stampede by blue-chip companies.
"When companies like Ford or General Electric come into the market, they squeeze a lot of other, somewhat riskier credits out," said Gail D. Fosler, the chief economist at the Conference Board. 
Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at the Harris Trust and Savings Bank, said that the economic recovery depended on companies' being able to get credit.
"My primary concern is the lack of available credit across the spectrum," he said. "We are forecasting an economic recovery in the middle of next year, but the one thing that could go wrong with that forecast is if the availability of credit stays where it is or gets worse."
Another concern is that debt is piling up with negative consequences. "The Fed is trying to prevent the bubble from bursting by keeping the forces of credit exuberance alive," Barton M. Biggs, chief global strategist at Morgan Stanley, wrote to investors earlier this month. "The trouble is, although it may work in the short run, in the long run the debt burden will be bigger and the adjustment process more painful."
The automakers, for example, are using the money they have raised in part to support the customer incentive programs that offer zero-interest financing. They are paying as much as 7.25 percent, in other words, to lend money to car buyers for nothing. 
Some of the new debt is being used to retire commercial paper. But companies are taking on more than they need to accomplish that goal.
The longer-term money they are borrowing is more expensive than the commercial paper, even if it is cheaper than it has been in a long time. The spread -- the difference in interest rates between Treasuries and corporate bonds -- has generally widened since Sept. 11, although not across the board.
"There is a cost factor involved, but we try to minimize that," said David Moore, manager of fixed-income investor relations at Ford Credit, which accounted for the bulk of the $9.4 billion that Ford borrowed last month. "We're mindful of our liquidity, and want to make sure we ensure it."
Like many of the companies issuing debt, Ford is curbing its dependence on the commercial paper market. For the year through Oct. 16, Ford had cut the amount of paper it had outstanding by almost 60 percent, to $17 billion. "That puts us in a very good position, given our rating," said Mr. Moore, who was one of the few executives willing to discuss his company's strategy.
Ford, like a host of other companies, has had its credit ratings cut. Many buyers of commercial paper, like money market funds, lend to only the highest-rated companies. So far this year, Standard & Poor's has knocked 57 companies out of the top ratings for commercial paper, compared with 49 last year.
The total amount of outstanding commercial paper has fallen 30 percent this year, according to Diane Vazza, head of global financial investment research at Standard & Poor's, thanks to that downgrading and to great caution among investors. "We've seen some issuers driven out of the market," Ms. Vazza said. 
According to several credit analysts, DaimlerChrysler was scheduled to roll over $7 billion of commercial paper in June but decided to take the offering to Europe, where investors are less particular about ratings quality.
Similarly, Enron careered into its crisis when it was forced to redeem commercial paper as its credit ratings fell.
The decline in AT&T's commercial paper ratings was one reason for its big issue last week.
But underwriters of corporate debt insist that the decline in the commercial paper market has more to do with companies' ability to borrow for the long term cheaply than with their inability to issue short-term debt. "Short-term financing does come with a maturity risk in that you constantly have to roll it over in order to maintain liquidity," said Mr. LoBue of J. P. Morgan.
The underwriters concede, however, that lending by banks has all but dried up, falling to its lowest level in three decades. Bank lending has been curtailed at the behest of Federal regulators like the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency at the Treasury Department, putting them seemingly at cross-purposes with the Fed.
The chief executive of EchoStar, Charles W. Ergen, had to put up $2.75 billion of his own money to complete the purchase of the Hughes Electronic Corporation. The bankers at UBS Warburg, EchoStar's adviser on the deal, had offered to provide the financing, but only with a proviso that would have let the bank back out of the deal under certain conditions.
Although the company later got financing from Credit Suisse First Boston and Deutsche Bank, many other bankers have privately applauded UBS Warburg's caution.

HEADLINE: Ailey Troupe Goes in Search Of Big Money 

BYLINE:  By JENNIFER DUNNING 

 BODY:
With the economy in decline and contributions flooding into charities related to the terrorist attacks, now is a tough time to ask people to think about donating money to cultural institutions. But the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater is optimistic. The company plans to start asking the public to contribute to its $60 million capital campaign tomorrow, when it opens its five-week season at City Center. 
 Sharon Gersten Luckman, executive director of the Ailey troupe, said $47.5 million had already been raised, including $12.5 million from the city and a gift of $15 million from Joan and Sanford I. Weill. Ms. Weill is the chairwoman of the Ailey board; Mr. Weill is the chairman of Citigroup. The campaign seeks to raise $47.5 million for a new headquarters on the northwest corner of Ninth Avenue and 55th Street in Manhattan, to be called the Joan Weill Center for Dance, and $12.5 million for an endowment. 
 Ms. Luckman said that donors had been surprisingly generous given the bleak economic forecast. "They knew this would be one time only," she said. "We wouldn't be coming back again and again for the next building."
The Ailey company has not been alone in its quest for a new home base. The Mark Morris Group opened a new headquarters in Brooklyn in September. 
In Manhattan, George Faison, the Tony Award-winning choreographer of "The Wiz," has turned a former firehouse on West 124th Street into a dance studio and office building that will begin operations next month. Plans will be announced early next year for a newly renovated building to be opened by Mikhail Baryshnikov in the West 30's. And the Joyce Theater recently completed a study on the feasibility of creating a large dance theater. But the planned Ailey headquarters is said to be the biggest building in the nation devoted exclusively to dance. It is scheduled to open in June 2004. 
The new headquarters, designed by Natan Bibliowicz and Carolyn Iu, is to have 12 studios, two of which would open out to form a black box theater, and space for offices, a library, a physical therapy room and the company's archives. Other companies would be able to rent rehearsal studios, a dwindling commodity in New York dance today, at reduced rates. Passers-by would get a glimpse of classes and rehearsals through huge windows in several studios on upper floors and at street level, where scrims decorated with photographs of Ailey performers would offer dancers some measure of privacy. A huge banner of a dancer in the white skirts of Ailey's "Cry" is to hang on the 55th Street side. 
"We are trying to create a canvas for dancers to express themselves," Mr. Bibliowicz said. "A simple environment with all the amenities they need." Designs for the building will be on exhibit at City Center and at an open house on Jan. 16 at the troupe's current home at 211 West 61st Street. 
Two years ago the Ailey company planned to move into two more floors in the West 61st Street building that were expected to be vacated by the Postal Service, which had a post office branch there. At the time Ms. Weill told the board that Mr. Bibliowicz, her son-in-law, would be willing to join others who had volunteered to help the company with expansion plans. The search for a new space began after plans to move the post office branch fell through.
"We were very excited about Natan's work," Ms. Luckman said when asked why Mr. Bibliowicz was the only architect considered by the company. "It would have been disingenuous to open up the process."
The designs provide for 77,000 square feet of space, more than doubling the company's rental on West 61st Street. Judith Jamison, the artistic director of the Ailey company, said she began to see the need for more space several years ago. "There was Mickey Bord, our archivist, working in a closet with 40-some years of history around her," Ms. Jamison said. "Our second company was having to rent space because all our studios were rented."
Ms. Jamison said that having a new company home had a strong personal meaning for her. "This really means something about survival and about where I've come from," she said. "Along the way, there was this genius man, and I became a part of his life. I can't wait to see the astonishment of all the people who loved Alvin when they walk through the door."

HEADLINE: McCall to Stress Education and Recall His Roots in Speech Ratcheting Up Campaign 

BYLINE:  By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA 

DATELINE: ALBANY, Nov. 26 

 BODY:
Harking back to his own poor-child-made-good life story, H. Carl McCall, in the first major speech of his run for governor, will promise to make education the centerpiece of his campaign.
 "Education was my salvation," says a text of the speech, which Mr. McCall, the state comptroller, plans to deliver Tuesday at New York University and again here in Albany. "Without it, I would not be standing before you today." 
 It goes on to make some bold pledges. "I guarantee that within four years of my taking office, 75 percent of the students in this state will pass the standardized tests in English and math," the speech says. It also vows that Mr. McCall, on his "first day in office," will abolish the state's arcane and politically charged way of distributing school aid.
Mr. McCall's speech also promises to demand accountability from teachers and administrators, and it blames the Republican incumbent, Gov. George E. Pataki, for some of the public schools' woes.
The speech assails the governor for a flagging upstate economy, an issue used to great effect by Senators Charles E. Schumer and Hillary Rodham Clinton, a pair of Democrats who fared well with upstate voters, once the state's most reliable Republican bloc.
Mr. McCall will also accuse Mr. Pataki of lacking fiscal discipline, citing chronically late state budgets, rising debt and a current budget that all involved have described as a train wreck. 
But perhaps the most striking aspect of the speech is its use of a compelling and varied personal history that McCall partisans have long called his greatest political asset. The child of a single mother on welfare, he became an ordained minister, an ambassador to the United Nations, a vice president of Citicorp and the first black person to hold statewide office in New York. It is a history he has been reluctant to trumpet at times; Mr. McCall's own advisers joke that when he was elected comptroller in 1994, many of those who voted for him did not know he was black.
"My mother raised me and my five sisters all by herself," the speech says. "Times were tough. We didn't have a lot. But she told me that if I studied hard and worked hard, education would open doors of opportunity and make just about anything possible. My mother was right."
For much of this year, Mr. McCall's allies worried that his campaigning was too subdued, as his Democratic primary rival, Andrew M. Cuomo, the former housing secretary, and Mr. Pataki consistently drew more attention to themselves. Polls have shown Mr. McCall trailing in the primary, and both Democrats have run behind Mr. Pataki.
Mr. McCall's strategists counseled patience, insisting that the race would not really begin until attention shifted from the New York City mayoral contest. Mr. McCall stepped up the pace of his campaign in late summer, but he was largely ignored in the aftermath of the Sept. 11 attacks.
Tuesday's speech, his advisers say, reflects the start of a more intensive effort by Mr. McCall to put himself in the spotlight, and to draw contrasts with Mr. Pataki.
"The Pataki administration has allowed a huge educational canyon to form in this state," it says, between have and have-not districts. And, it adds, "New York has the most inequitable school aid distribution in America."
The speech attacks the governor for fighting a lawsuit charging that the state did not adequately finance New York City schools.
That is a potentially powerful issue, but it carries the risk that Mr. McCall will be seen as the city's standard-bearer, traditionally the kiss of death upstate.
His remarks could also be heard as an echo of Fernando Ferrer's theme, in the mayoral race, of standing up for "the other New York" -- a stance that was criticized as racially and economically divisive.
Mr. McCall's speech cites his experience as the former president of New York City's Board of Education, but Mr. Pataki's team is prepared to turn that on the comptroller, blaming him for the city schools' failings.
The pledge to have 75 percent of students pass standardized tests is also likely to raise eyebrows.
On the assessment tests that all New York fourth graders take, 60 percent passed the English portion this year, and 69 percent passed in math.

HEADLINE: Economists Make It Official: U.S. Is inRecession 

BYLINE:  By RICHARD W. STEVENSON

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 26 

 BODY:
The group of economists that tracks business cycles made official today what has been apparent to laid-off workers and struggling businesses for months: the longest economic expansion on record gave way earlier this year to the first recession in a decade and the 10th since World War II.
 The group, the National Bureau of Economic Research's business-cycle dating committee, said the recession began in March, months before the terrorist attacks on Sept. 11 or the sharp rise in unemployment. 
 The group's statement put a headstone on a remarkable period of economic vibrancy. The last decade included the emergence of the stock market as a national sport, the appearance (and subsequent disappearance) of huge federal budget surpluses, a heated debate about the merits of globalization and a surge of optimism about the potential of a technology-driven "new economy." 
It is unclear how much of the 1990's boom will survive this recession and the pressures of war, and economists are divided about how strong the rebound will be once the recession ends, which the consensus of experts holds will be in the first half of next year.
While today's announcement contained no news about the current state of the economy or any forecast of how long the downturn would last, it is sure to increase the pressure on both parties in Congress to break their impasse over the shape of a proposed economic stimulus bill. 
It could also force President Bush -- ever mindful that his father was defeated for re-election in 1992 because many thought he had neglected the economy for foreign policy -- to spend more time tending to domestic issues even as he focuses on the struggle against terrorism. 
After the business-cycle committee's announcement this morning, Mr. Bush called on Congress to complete work on the stimulus package by Christmas, setting aside his previous deadline of Nov. 30.
Republicans are pressing for a bill that is heavy on tax breaks for businesses. Democrats want a plan that would expand unemployment benefits and subsidize health insurance premiums for laid-off workers.
The president said the country had "the framework for economic recovery in place," including low interest rates, declining oil prices and the benefits of the tax cut measure he signed in June.
"But I am obviously aware that our economy is slow," Mr. Bush told reporters in the White House Rose Garden. "And we will do everything we can to enhance recovery."
By some measures, the economy was still growing as winter turned to spring, and some analysts had expected the recession's official start to be placed in late spring or early summer.
But the committee, made up of six prominent academic and business economists, said March was the month when employment reached a peak and began declining, a turning point it said it considered the most crucial in determining when an expansion has run its course.
Among the other factors that the committee said it considered most important in determining when the expansion had ended, industrial production has been declining since September 2000 and a broad measure of sales reached a peak late last year. Only one measure that the group said was important -- personal income minus welfare payments and other transfers from the government to individuals -- has continued to increase throughout 2001.
"The committee is satisfied that the total contraction in the economy is sufficient to merit the determination that a recession is under way," it said.
The committee said the terrorist attacks did not cause the nation's economic problems, but might have been enough to make the difference between a pronounced slowdown and a formal recession.
In particular, the group said, the rise in unemployment in October to 5.4 percent from 4.9 percent in September provided compelling evidence that employment was in sharp decline.
"Before the attacks," it said, "it is possible that the decline in the economy would have been too mild to qualify as a recession. The attacks clearly deepened the contraction and may have been an important factor in turning the episode into a recession."
The economists on the committee are Robert Hall of Stanford University, the group's chairman; Martin Feldstein of Harvard University, who is president of the National Bureau of Economic Research; Ben S. Bernanke of Princeton University; Jeffrey Frankel of Harvard; Robert Gordon of Northwestern University; and Victor Zarnowitz of the Conference Board, a business research group.
Just as in the last downturn cycle -- from July 1990 to March 1991, a period in which Iraq invaded Kuwait and the United States and its allies responded with military action -- the nation confronts the challenge of dealing simultaneously with war and recession.
Barring any new terrorist attacks, economists expect this downturn to be over in the first half of 2002. Recent signs that the rise in unemployment may be leveling off, plus generally positive reports about retail sales after Thanksgiving and a revival on Wall Street, have led some economists to predict a bounce back early next year.
But there is considerable disagreement about how robust a rebound can be expected, with some analysts predicting that growth will remain lackluster for a year or two after the recession officially ends.
Merrill Lynch, the investment house, forecast today that the recession would end by March. It said the combination of aggressive interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve, tax cuts and government spending would lead economic growth to reach a red-hot annual rate of 5 percent in the second half of next year.
Some economists elsewhere said it could take much longer for the United States to get back to a semblance of the good times that it enjoyed through much of the 1990's.
"The official recession could be pretty short," said James W. Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Wells Capital Management, an investment firm. "But the real issue isn't when the recession ends. It's when do you get back to a sustainable growth rate of 3 to 4 percent, and on that count I think there's going to be disappointment."
Consumers have sated themselves on big-ticket purchases and pushed their savings rates to almost zero, leaving them an unlikely engine of economic recovery, Mr. Paulsen said.
The Federal Reserve's campaign of interest rate cuts may not be as effective as expected, he said, with long-term rates not falling as much as anticipated this year and the strong dollar making it difficult for manufacturers to sell products abroad.
Mr. Paulsen said it could be well into 2003 before the economy was really back on track.
If the recovery this time around is anemic, it would match the experience of the early 90's. The last recession formally ended in March 1991, but the recovery proceeded in fits and starts over the next two years. The economy contracted slightly in the first quarter of 1993 before returning to a sustained pattern of healthy growth.

HEADLINE: Hudson's Bay Reports 3rd-Quarter Loss 

BYLINE:  Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: TORONTO, Nov. 26 

 BODY:
The Hudson's Bay Company, Canada's largest department store chain by sales, had a loss of 2 million Canadian dollars ($1.3 million) after excluding the benefits of an accounting rule change in its most recent quarter, as shoppers bought less clothing. 
 The retailer's loss was 7 cents a share for the quarter, in contrast to net income of 19.7 million Canadian dollars, or 23 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue in the period, which ended Oct. 31 and was the third quarter of Hudson's Bay's fiscal year, fell to 1.76 billion from 1.77 billion Canadian dollars. 
 The retailer, which is based in Toronto, has cut prices because of growing competition and a slowing economy. Its Zellers discount chain is fighting to keep customers from shopping at Wal-Mart Stores Inc. The company's upmarket Bay department stores offered discounts on most items to compete with Sears Canada Inc., a unit of Sears, Roebuck & Company; Sears Canada is the nation's second-largest department store chain by sales. 
Hudson's Bay's chief executive, George Heller, also cited "intense" competition from stores owned by the San Francisco-based retailers Williams-Sonoma Inc. and Gap Inc. Specialty stores are able to identify and obtain trendy merchandise more quickly, said Sean Mason, who analyzes retailers for Dominion Bond Rating Service Ltd. 
Mr. Mason said weather that was warmer than usual in the quarter also kept people from buying new fall and winter clothes. 
"They've got bad weather; the competition is discounting; they're looking at a soft economy; they're going into the most competitive time of the year," he said. "It's not going to be a good Christmas, for profits or sales." 
Hudson's Bay has said that fourth-quarter sales will be little changed from last year's 2.42 billion Canadian dollars.

HEADLINE: The Neediest Cases; 
After Losing High Hopes, A Chance to Hope Again

BYLINE:  By AARON DONOVAN 

 BODY:
There was a time when things looked promising for Gavin Dutchin. It was the early 90's, he had recently graduated from Massachusetts Institute of Technology and had landed his first job on Wall Street, at Cowen & Company, an investment banking firm.
 "I saw great potential for myself," he recalled recently. "I just wanted to work for someone who would at least give me a chance to exhibit my talent, and that seemed like the ideal place to do it." 
 Four years later, far from his dream of making a name for himself on Wall Street, Mr. Dutchin was homeless, and shortly thereafter, he was taken to a psychiatric ward at Bellevue Hospital Center. His downward spiral had begun in December 1994, when he was laid off from his job as an assistant managing director, he said.
By now, he has an apartment and medication to control his mental illnesses, and his life is improving with the help of a psychiatric treatment program run by FEGS, formerly the Federation Employment and Guidance Service.
At the program, he attends classes that help him improve his organizational skills, memory and concentration. FEGS is a beneficiary agency of UJA-Federation of New York, one of the seven local charities supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund.
After he lost his job, Mr. Dutchin worked from his parents' house in Jamaica, Queens, for two years, trying to set up a company, Mlishi, to foster development in his native Guyana. He supported himself mostly by tapping into his 401(k) retirement fund, and by tutoring high school and college students who needed help in algebra or calculus. But the company never prospered.
Then came 1998 -- the year, he said, that "things started to fall apart for me." Mr. Dutchin's father, Carlyle, died of prostate cancer at 70. "He was the cornerstone of the family," Mr. Dutchin said. 
So his mother, Carmen, then 68, moved back to Guyana, and he moved in with his older sister Loraine Dutchin, who was raising two children on her own in Flatbush, Brooklyn. In exchange for a spot on his sister's couch, Mr. Dutchin helped her two teenagers with their math homework. But eventually, she began to feel that it was an uneven trade, he said, and he had to leave.
He spent two years homeless. At night, he rode the F train back and forth between Jamaica, Queens, and Coney Island, learning that by the time a train made two complete circuits, it would be late morning, time for him to help a food salesman on Canal Street attach his food cart to his car. For his services, Mr. Dutchin would get three or four bagels that had not been sold that day, and would take them to eat in Washington Square.
After finishing his breakfast, Mr. Dutchin would walk to the Barnes & Noble bookstore at Union Square, where he read books about advanced mathematical theory in the fourth-floor reading lounge.
A quiet man who says he keeps to himself, Mr. Dutchin maintained a low profile. Nobody seemed to notice that he never bought any books. "All that I can remember thinking was that somebody would see me and tell my mother so that at least she could come and get me," he recalled.
Minnie Berman, director of the FEGS program in Manhattan, said his symptoms were consistent with someone with a history of psychosis and depression. "Since he came to us he's been very stable," she said.
One day on a crowded downtown street, someone stepped on the back of Mr. Dutchin's foot. He declined to discuss details of the incident, other than to say, "We had an exchange of words."
Whatever happened, it was serious enough to cause a bystander to call an ambulance, and Mr. Dutchin was taken to Bellevue, where he was placed in a psychiatric ward for three months. There he was treated for tuberculosis and began taking a mood stabilizing drug and an anti-psychotic, he said, both of which he still takes daily. 
Mr. Dutchin wants to become an economist. Staff members at FEGS are helping him apply for graduate school. "My short-term goal is to get my Ph.D.," Mr. Dutchin said, "and to complete my involvement with taking medication."

HEADLINE: A NATION CHALLENGED: THE SPECIAL MASTER; 
Mediator Named to Run Sept. 11 Fund

BYLINE:  By DIANA B. HENRIQUES and DAVID BARSTOW 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 26 

 BODY:
Attorney General John Ashcroft today appointed Kenneth R. Feinberg, a Democratic lawyer with extensive experience in mediating complex and emotionally charged disputes, to run the multibillion-dollar federal fund set up to compensate the families of those killed or physically injured in the September terrorist attacks.
 In making the appointment, which is not subject to Congressional review, Mr. Ashcroft also directed Mr. Feinberg, who has offices both here and in New York City, to begin making at least partial payments to families by the end of the year or sooner. 
 As special master of the Sept. 11 Victims Compensation Fund, Mr. Feinberg will be the final arbiter of how to distribute at least $11 billion in victim compensation, and possibly much more -- money that will be the single most important source of long-term financial support for thousands of families who lost a breadwinner in the attacks. The awards, based in large part on a victim's lost earning power, could well exceed $1 million per family.
Mr. Feinberg's powers are sweeping: he will help draft the fund's rules and procedures, will oversee its operations, and will personally sign off on all the awards made to claimants, who must waive their right to sue over the attacks and who cannot appeal the fund's decisions to any court.
The attorney general, to whom the special master reports, and Mr. Feinberg signaled that the fund should put victims' needs ahead of the ultimate expense to taxpayers.
Mr. Feinberg's political pedigree -- he was formerly chief of staff for Senator Edward M. Kennedy and was considered for the post of White House counsel in the Clinton administration -- makes him seem like an unlikely choice for the fund, which was created in September as part of the airline industry bailout bill.
But he has extensive experience in mediating complicated compensation disputes, including those that arose over the Agent Orange defoliant used in Vietnam and the Dalkon Shield birth control device.
Mr. Ashcroft called him a seasoned "legal counselor, prosecutor, manager and arbitrator" who has had extensive experience handling other cases involving mass casualties. "It's that experience and expertise which we anticipate will provide the basis for good decision-making on his part here," Mr. Ashcroft said.
Mr. Feinberg's candidacy was supported by both Democrats and Republicans, from Senator Charles E. Schumer, the New York Democrat, to Senator Chuck Hagel, a Republican from Nebraska. Mr. Hagel first worked with Mr. Feinberg on behalf of Vietnam veterans in the Agent Orange case.
"I went to the White House and said, 'I'm going to say as forcefully as I can that there is one guy out there you need to take a look at -- he was Ted Kennedy's chief of staff, but as you pick yourself up off the floor from that, let me tell you this guy is as fair and honest as anybody I've ever seen,' " said Mr. Hagel.
Although the fund is open-ended and must be financed by taxpayers -- some of whom have written to the Department of Justice in recent weeks to caution against using the United States Treasury to enrich victims and their families -- neither Mr. Ashcroft nor Mr. Feinberg cited the interests of taxpayers today.
Instead, each stressed the importance of ministering to the financial needs of victims and their families. Mr. Ashcroft said his "first instruction" to Mr. Feinberg was to provide partial "advance payments" to victims and their families to help them meet immediate financial needs.
"For those victims struggling to pay bills and make payments," Mr. Ashcroft said, "our message should be today: 'You are not alone. Help is on the way."'
Some fiscal conservatives have been extremely nervous about the ultimate cost of the victims compensation fund. Congress set no caps on either the total size of the fund or how much any one victim's family could get.
Today, some vowed to closely scrutinize awards made by Mr. Feinberg.
"All tax dollars come with some strings attached, and that string is Congressional oversight," said Jill Gerber, a spokeswoman for Senator Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, the ranking Republican on the Senate Finance Committee. "Any time Congress is doling out billions of dollars, it expects a full accounting of that expenditure, and Senator Grassley is certainly in that category."
By law, the fund must be up and operating by Dec. 21, and Mr. Feinberg said that he hoped to issue preliminary rules within 10 days. But first, he said, he plans to review the hundreds of written public comments about the fund and meet with victims' rights groups, plaintiffs' lawyers and officials from the leading charities.
"This is not an adversarial process at all," he said.
Mr. Feinberg, in a subsequent interview at his Washington law office, said his goal would be to create a program that would be "simple, efficient and clear." 
He also pledged to meet with as many claimants as possible. "I am, in a sense, a fiduciary for them," he said. "My role is to help them."
Some lawyers have cautioned that certain victim families may be better served going to court rather than seeking a quicker award from the fund, which might be less generous.
Mr. Feinberg, who said that he and several members of his law firm would be working for the fund without pay, said that he faced a formidable to-do list before he could start making awards.
He must determine whether the fund's awards should be reduced by any charity a family has received, which he called "a very big issue." He also must clarify, with greater precision than the statute does, who is eligible for the fund. And he must determine how to handle claims from fragmented families, and how to cope with the inequities that are sure to emerge in awards made to victims of such widely disparate economic circumstances.
His appointment was greeted with some surprise but general applause within the legal profession.
"Ken Feinberg has become the most important person on earth to thousands of devastated families, and he has exactly the right resume for this job," said Leo V. Boyle, president of the Association of Trial Lawyers of America, which is providing free legal counsel to every family that files a claim with the fund.

HEADLINE: A Surfing Firefighter, a Thrill-Riding Hunter, a Mormon Composer

BYLINE: These sketches were written by Carla Baranauckas, Nichole M. Christian, Jane Gross, Constance L. Hays, Jan Hoffman, N. R. Kleinfield, Barbara Stewart and Robert F. Worth.

 BODY:
Here are glimpses of some of the victims of the Sept. 11 attack on the World Trade Center.

PAUL BRISTOW
A Cheeky Blithe Spirit
 Blithe spirits come in all sizes: this one was about 5 feet 6, skinny, with a smile that asserts itself in Cathy Bruneau's snapshots. There he is, Paul Bristow, cocking his head, compelling you to cast off the grumps, wearing a fright wig, kicking up a leg. 
 The British-born Mr. Bristow, 27 -- ''a little cheeky person,'' says Ms. Bruneau, his fiance and companion for seven years, first in London and then in Brooklyn -- made sure that he never worked more than he needed to, which is not to say that he slacked off at the Risk Waters Group, where he helped organize conferences. It's just that he preserved time for the important things: shopping, friends, shooting pool, getting lost on a country road and savoring its beauty.
 Funny, endearing, he could charm even the crustiest. Here is Mr. Bristow, surrounded by Ms. Bruneau's non-English-speaking relatives, rolling in their seats at a wedding in France as he repeatedly tries out his one sentence in French: ''Another bottle of white wine, please?''
 Like a child, he would dance impatiently around Ms. Bruneau when he wanted attention. But he reciprocated in spades when she was blue, with giant hugs to help her ''get the cry out,'' as he would put it.

EMERIC HARVEY
A Memorable Voice
 As a young man, Emeric (Ric) Harvey sold truck rides to children with his friend Ray in Sheepshead Bay, Brooklyn, where he grew up. ''Come swing and sway with Rick and Ray!'' he'd bellow. Eventually, that voice was heard on the trading floor of the American Stock Exchange, where he became a force as founder and president of Harvey Young Yurman Inc.
 His relentless energy made him a natural leader, though at times it was hard to keep up, said his daughter Jennifer Castelano. Part of it came from having lived through some close calls: as a young man in Texas, he nearly boarded an Air Force plane that crashed, killing everyone on board. And he narrowly missed being in the World Trade Center when it was bombed in 1993. On Sept. 11, Mr. Harvey, 56, of Montclair, N.J., was at a weekly breakfast meeting at Windows on the World.
 His drive and generosity remain an inspiration, a loud one. ''That's how I get out of bed every morning, because I can hear him yelling, 'What are you doing lying there crying?' '' said his wife, Jennifer Harvey.

ROBERT TWOMEY
A History and Science Buff
 There were no limits to Robert Twomey's love for history and science. Botany, entomology, viniculture, the Civil War: he was always reading something and loved talking about it. ''He retained everything,'' said his wife, Marie Twomey.
 Mr. Twomey, 48, did graduate work in biology in his 20's, but never finished his dissertation and got into finance when he and his wife had the first of their two boys 18 years ago. He worked as a trader on the American Stock Exchange with Ric Harvey, his brother-in-law, at Harvey Young Yurman, and dreamed of retiring to teach in public school. On Sept. 11, he was at a weekly breakfast meeting at Windows on the World.
 When he was not reading, he loved to ride his bike from his home in Sheepshead Bay, Brooklyn, to Breezy Point, Queens. He knew a lot about Sheepshead Bay, where his family had lived for more than a century. It was one of the many things he shared with his wife, whom he married when they were both 19. ''I'm living in the house my grandparents bought in 1905,'' Mrs. Twomey said. ''Bob's father played in the construction site of this house.''

THOMAS HASKELL
Creating Tiny Wonderlands
 In some ways, Thomas Haskell seemed like everyone's idea of a firefighter. The battalion chief for Ladder Company 132 in Brooklyn, he loved football -- ''God help you if you got in the way of the TV'' on Sundays, said Dawn Haskell-Carbone, his sister -- and he played on the Fire Department team, like his brothers, Kenneth and Timothy. Timothy Haskell also died in the World Trade Center attack.
 But he had another side. Every year just before Thanksgiving, Mr. Haskell, 37, would start disappearing into the basement of his home in Massapequa, N.Y., for hours, forbidding anyone else to come down. ''He'd stay up till 3 a.m.,'' said his wife, Barbara Haskell. Then, about two weeks before Christmas, his wife, daughters, friends and other relatives would be invited downstairs to see an elaborate winter landscape with hundreds of tiny ceramic figures, surrounded by ski chalets, with three separate train sets running through it all.
 Last year he built three miniature towns -- Meaghanville, Erinburg and Taratown, named for his daughters -- along with Barbara's Garden, for his wife. Behind them all was a dark blue night sky, lit up with electric stars.

LORENZO RAMZEY
King of Chess, Not Golf
 His nickname was Grandmaster. For anyone who dared to move a pawn against him, the reason was obvious. Lorenzo Ramzey played a daunting game of chess.
 Every day during his lunch hour, he challenged anyone to play. If no one was willing, that did not stop him. He dragooned an opponent into a game. Could you beat him? Forget it.
 When he went home to East Northport, N.Y., where he lived with his wife, Volteen, it was often back to the chessboard. He would log on to the Internet and play against cyberspace opponents, sometimes until 3 in the morning. Relatives would call, and the phone line would be busy for hours. Mrs. Ramzey's grown children were planning to get her a second phone line.
 Last summer, two relatives in Florida played an epic game against Mr. Ramzey on the Internet and, for the first time, beat him. ''They never let him forget that,'' said Jennifer Fontus, his stepdaughter. ''They said they had dethroned the Grandmaster.'' He was supposed to visit them for Thanksgiving for a rematch. 
 Mr. Ramzey, 48, came to America from Panama when he was in his late teens, and worked his way up in the insurance business, eventually becoming a casualty broker at Aon. He also loved golf, but was less proficient with woods and irons than with knights and bishops; friends who had been humbled at chess were quick to remark, ''Did he tell you about his golf game?''

GARY H. LEE
The Incurable Collector
 Bayonets. Eagles. Baseball cards. Hess trucks. Vinyl records. Matchbooks. Coins. Stamps. Old record players.
 These were some of the things Gary H. Lee collected. Just about anything might meet his criteria and turn into a full-blown collection.
 Mr. Lee, 62, and known variously as Uncle Dude, Big Gary or Pop Pop, lived with his wife, Eileen, in Lindenhurst, on Long Island, where the attic was very full. There is all this World War II gear up there -- helmets, uniforms, bayonets. He had something like 150 bayonets and swords, 40,000 baseball cards, dozens of statues and pictures of eagles, every birthday and anniversary card he ever received. ''He was collecting his whole life,'' said Gary A. Lee, his son. ''And he never sold anything.''
 Mr. Lee, a senior vice president at Cantor Fitzgerald, did not collect cars, but he always wanted a Studebaker. About 15 years ago, he bought a 1948 model that he lovingly restored and took to car shows, winning several first- and second-place trophies. 
 His wife and son are trying to sort through his myriad collections. Some of the bayonets are being donated to a new World War II museum that the town of Babylon is opening in Lindenhurst. As for the baseball cards, the eagles and the Hess trucks, his son is going to continue those collections. ''I think he would want me to,'' he said.

JOHN ERNST EICHLER
Magician and Joker
 John Ernst Eichler believed in bringing the world some comic relief -- not in a clownish way, but with his own brand of dry wit. ''He had one of the greatest senses of humor on the face of the earth,'' said his friend Edmund Redsecker. ''He could brighten your day.''
 Mr. Eichler, 69, of Cedar Grove, N.J., retired several years ago as director of administration for Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft. He was at a breakfast at Windows on the World on Sept. 11.
 He was a man of multiple avocations. He joined the New York Academy of Sciences, attending lectures with rapt attention. (''But you don't understand what they're saying,'' his friend Gene Bloch would say. ''Yes, but I look like I understand it, don't I?'' Mr. Eichler would reply.) He was also a member of the Society of American Magicians, performing sleight-of-hand for friends, said Rod Eichler, his son.
 And he was known for his practical jokes. Once, he walked into a men's clothing store owned by a friend in Montclair, N.J. He took out a handful of black plastic ants and scattered them over the sweater table. ''He started making a commotion,'' his son recalled, ''saying, 'I can't believe it, there's an insect problem here, they're all over the sweaters.' ''

VINCENT A. PRINCIOTTA
The Essence of Cool
 First there was the blue van with the surfboard strapped to the roof. Then there were the bright Hawaiian shirts, the flowing hair, the perpetual tan. Soon there was no doubt: Vincent A. Princiotta was cool. 
 Starting in the late 1970's, Mr. Princiotta, a firefighter with Ladder Company 7 in Manhattan, led a band of surfers from their landlocked Bronxwood Avenue neighborhood into the big waves off Gilgo Beach. ''I think he watched too much Don Ho,'' said Dave Breiner, a Connecticut firefighter who knew him as Vinny Van. When he visited his sister Bernadette at college in Hawaii, her friends were amazed, she said, that a non-Hawaiian, ''this haoli from the Bronx,'' was so able on the longboard. 
 Even as the years rolled by, and he married the lovely Karen and became the adoring father of Christina, now 16 months old, Mr. Princiotta, 39, who lived in Orangeburg, N.Y., maintained his profile. He invested in phony winning lottery tickets, which he would distribute to his fellow firefighters and watch while they shrieked and kissed the firehouse floor. But he also helped the younger ones get familiar with firefighting tools, said Patty Boylan, a friend and colleague at Ladder 7, and cooked heaps of Italian food for the entire company. And he kept on surfing. ''He was just supercool,'' Mr. Boylan said. ''We called him the Vin Man.''

STEPHEN P. DIMINO
Generous From the Start
 When Stephen P. Dimino turned 9, his parents organized a special birthday trip into Manhattan from their home in Bensonhurst, Brooklyn. They took Stephen and his sister to see ''My Fair Lady,'' and then they all stuck nickels and dimes into the slots at an automat to get their lunch. 
 But then the boy spotted an old man sitting by himself who looked hungry. He brought his sandwich over to him. Then the rest of the Dimino family followed suit, said Gigi Ebert, Mr. Dimino's sister. ''We ended up giving him all of our food,'' she said.
 Mr. Dimino, 48, who was a partner at Cantor Fitzgerald, continued to be generous. ''He was someone you'd want as your neighbor,'' said his cousin Robert Messina. He loved to give people presents, like venison steaks from the deer he shot and souvenirs from his travels abroad. At home in Basking Ridge, N.J., he showered his daughter, Sabrina, 15, with time, too, ''hunting together, playing video games together, riding roller coasters together,'' Mrs. Ebert said. ''He started taking her to Disneyland as soon as she was old enough to remember it. He really took delight in her and in her accomplishments. I thought he was going to burst the day she was born.''

GEORGE DiPASQUALE
Practiced What He Preached
 Melissa DiPasquale has told enough stories about her firefighter husband, cried enough tears before strangers. Now, she wants peace and privacy. Another article about George DiPasquale? His wife begs a reporter to use what has already been said about him in his local newspaper, The Staten Island Advance:
 His nickname at Ladder Company 2 in Manhattan was Holy Man, more respectful than many in the rough-and-tumble world of a firehouse. The 33-year-old firefighter, one of 10 from the company who raced to duty at 9:09 a.m. on Sept. 11 and never returned, was known for his faith.
 Mr. DiPasquale, an imposing 6-foot-5, was an elder at the Kingdom Hall of Jehovah's Witnesses in the Mariners Harbor neighborhood, and shared his thoughts on religion and hope with his colleagues. He was a man who ''practiced what he preached,'' said his father-in-law, Michael Mattei. ''What he said, he meant.''
 Mr. DiPasquale and his wife celebrated their ninth wedding anniversary in Cape May, N.J., just days before the attack. ''A perfect weekend,'' Mrs. DiPasquale said. The couple have a daughter, Georgia Rose, who is 22 months old.

MICHAEL EMMETT BRENNAN
Mikey B. the Prankster
 His birth certificate said Michael Emmett Brennan, but everyone knew him as Mikey B. And if there was fun to be had, he would find it.
 Growing up in a large Irish family in Queens, Mikey Brennan, 27, would delight in throwing a bucket of cold water on his brother Brian when he was in the shower. When his brother retaliated by smearing Vaseline in his hair, he could see the humor just as easily. ''He looked like the Fonz for about three weeks,'' Mr. Brennan recalled. And he could keep a secret. ''I found out about all these little pranks after the fact,'' said his mother, Eileen Walsh. ''And I said, 'That's my Mike?' ''
 As a child he was fascinated with police officers and firefighters; his favorite television show was ''CHiPs.'' So it was no surprise to his family when he left college in 1995 to become a firefighter. ''He had a passion for it,'' Ms. Walsh said, adding that he was continually working to improve his skills. He answered the call on Sept. 11 with Ladder Company 4.
 ''I've never been in a fire,'' Mr. Brennan said, ''but if I were, I would want Mikey to bring me out.''
 Yet his hard work never took the twinkle out of the eye of Mikey Brennan, an avid snowboarder and surfer who lived in Woodside, Queens. About a year ago at a family gathering, Ms. Walsh said, one of her daughters was talking about body piercing. ''Oh, please, don't get your tongue pierced,'' Ms. Walsh pleaded. With that, everyone started laughing as Mikey Brennan stuck out his tongue to show off his brand-new stud.
 ''While living,'' Mr. Brennan said, ''he lived.''

OLIVER BENNETT
Attentive and Quick-Witted
 Oliver Bennett, the younger and taller of the two Bennett sons, was a passionate listener. Joy Bennett, his mother, remembers him at gatherings: his head slightly lowered and his eyes intent on the person talking to him. In his quiet way, he drew attention. ''You were always aware of Oli,'' a friend told Mrs. Bennett. ''He was a very, very vital presence.''
 And, sometimes, a rather intimidating one. His withering one-liners, Mrs. Bennett said, ''could take your breath away.''
 ''You didn't cross Oli lightly. He let you know just what he thought. At 13, he'd say, 'I don't agree with you, Mom, but let's don't argue about it.' '' His decisions, she said, were absolute.
 He loved to draw, she said. The Bennett home in London, where he lived, is ''littered'' with his portraits. But he studied economics and psychology and became a financial writer for the Risk Water Group. On Sept. 11, he was at its conference at Windows on the World. He planned to quit journalism in a year, at 30, and open a restaurant and bar where conversation would flow easily. He saw himself as his own boss, the quiet center of the bar's hubbub, with an ever-changing parade of people to watch and listen to.

SEAMUS ONEAL
Many Names, Many Faces
 For Seamus Oneal, the idea of having one career and one name was much too timid. By 52, he had worked in five widely different professions, using three different names. As James, he studied drama at the University of Oklahoma, and as Seam, he acted, danced and sang in Off Broadway shows. ''It would be fair,'' said John Oneal, his brother, ''to call him a hippie.''
 Seam Oneal the hippie joined the Army, became Captain Oneal and won medals for his work in hospital administration. Nevertheless, after converting to Mormonism, he and Janet Kaye, his wife, and their three children moved into a bed and breakfast by a big Maryland temple and ran it together. Eventually, though, he returned to college to study advanced computer science, moved to Manhattan and took a job with eSpeed, a division of Cantor Fitzgerald.
 Along the way, he composed liturgical choral works that were played by the Mormon temple's orchestra. And he dropped Seam and became Seamus. ''He said, 'There might be other Jameses,' '' said his brother, '' 'but there won't be other Seamuses.' He was something. A piece of art.''

JOHN PATRICK TIERNEY
Dedicated to Firefighting
 On Father's Day, as Helen Tierney heard the news that three firefighters in Queens had been killed on the job, her heart broke. For the men who died, she cried. For her son John Patrick Tierney, 27, a probationary firefighter training in Queens at the time, she rejoiced that he had had that day off. ''He always said, 'Don't worry, Ma. Everything will be fine.' And it was.''
 So, on Sept. 11, when his unit, Ladder Company 9 in Manhattan, was called to the World Trade Center, she clung once again to her youngest son's words. Her prayer was that he had headed home to Staten Island that morning. But Mr. Tierney had hopped a fire truck so crowded that he was forced to sit in a colleague's lap. ''The other guys told him he didn't have to come,'' Mrs. Tierney said. ''But from the first day he went to probie school, he worked hard, he really wanted to be part of the Fire Department.''
 And he was, for six weeks.

The Confirmed Dead
 Following are the names of the people most recently confirmed to have died in the World Trade Center disaster, according to the New York City medical examiner's office, which said the victims' families had been notified.

HEADLINE: TASTINGS; 
Vouvray, Going to Extremes

BYLINE:  By Eric Asimov 

 BODY:
APART from its mellifluous name, Vouvray is a white wine with big marketing problems. First of all, it is not made from chardonnay, the world's most popular grape, or even from riesling, which has its devotees, or sauvignon blanc, which at least is well known. It is 100 percent chenin blanc, a versatile, fascinating grape that deserves to be thought of as among the world's elite, but instead is neglected. 
 There's a clear economic reason for this. Chenin blanc is more difficult than chardonnay or sauvignon blanc to grow and to make into wine. It seems to need a more precise combination of soil and weather than chardonnay, and is less easy for winemakers to manipulate with oak and other flavor-modifying tools. Though it is often used in California for jug wines and makes serviceable whites in South Africa, it reaches its full potential only in the Loire Valley, where in appellations like Vouvray it can range from steely to lusciously sweet. 
 Even so, the name Vouvray is no guarantee of a good chenin blanc. A lot of bad Vouvray is around, so chenin blanc lovers must find the best producers. Beyond that, while dry Vouvray, at times labeled sec, can be very good, I find off-dry, or demi-sec, Vouvrays to be better. Yet calling a wine off-dry can be a kiss of death in a country where people believe they like only dry wines.
If you feel this way, try an experiment. Next time you have a spicy dinner, say a Thai curry, try a demi-sec Vouvray like the Domaine du Clos Naudin from Foreau. The balance of refreshing acidity and moderate sweetness will stand up to those dishes.
The demi-secs also go well with creamy sauces, while dry Vouvrays are superb with light fish and shellfish dishes. Even sweet Vouvrays, labeled moelleux, can go well with food, though in certain vintages, like 1997, the grapes may have been subjected to botrytis, the noble rot, which renders them so lush and honeyed they are fit only for dessert.

FOREAU DOMAINE DU CLOS NAUDIN, DEMI-SEC 1997: $22
Deep gold with an almost oily texture; luscious and refreshing.

S. A. HUET, CLOS DU BOURG PREMIERE TRIE, MOELLEUX 1995: $60
Sweet, lively and well balanced, with a long finish.

THIERRY NERISSON 1998: $17
Floral and anise aromas; supple and pliant; honeyed yet acidic.

DOMAINE BOURILLON-DORLEANS, LA COULEE D'OR, MOELLEUX 1996: $37
Bright apple and anise flavors; surprisingly light.

FRANCOIS PINON, CUVEE TRADITION 1999: $17
Honey, apple and citrus flavors, well balanced.

LA VALLEE COQUETTE, DEMI-SEC 1999: $8
Pear, anise and honey aromas; fresh and balanced.

To the Editor:
 Re "A's Soar at Harvard, Nearing a Majority" (news article, Nov. 22): 
 Harvard is not the only university grappling with grade inflation. 
The trend is national and longstanding. Part of the problem is the unstable equilibrium: it takes just one professor, department or college to relax grading standards for everyone to experience pressure to inflate grades to maintain teaching evaluations and student enrollments and to keep graduates competitive against other campuses in the job market.
To help employers evaluate the effects of grade inflation, every graduate's transcript should include not only the student's grade point average but also the average G.P.A. of all graduates, broken down by department, college and campus. These averages should become part of departmental and college evaluations.

HEADLINE: In Chinatown, A Taste of Revival 

BYLINE:  By REGINA SCHRAMBLING 

 BODY:
IF every day were the Sunday after Thanksgiving, Chinatown would almost feel like its old self again. But the bustling streets, crowded markets and long lines at so many restaurants last weekend were unlike what the area has generally experienced since Sept. 11, when the attacks less than half a mile away left the neighborhood sealed off and without phone service.
 For two months, Chinatown was the forgotten downtown as concerned diners headed to struggling but trendier places in TriBeCa. In addition to their empty dining rooms, restaurants were left with no way for customers to call in orders or make reservations, no system to process credit cards, no cash to buy fresh fish and produce. The road to recovery has been so rough that many restaurateurs in Chinatown still count themselves lucky if business is off only 50 percent. 
 But the restaurant business still appears to be the brightest spot in the neighborhood's economy, which has lost 6,000 jobs, according to the Manhattan borough president, C. Virginia Fields. Garment factories are struggling, and gift shops are often so empty that salesclerks can be spotted sleeping on their stools in midafternoon. Yet enterprises founded on food are surviving and, more than other types of business, showing signs of slowly coming back to life. 
Phone service has been partially restored, and most streets are open, with state troopers helping to direct traffic as best they can in unfamiliar terrain. Distress signals like "For Rent" signs and boarded-up storefronts are few below Canal Street.
Things do move a little slower -- soup dumplings at Goody's arrive in 20 minutes instead of 5, the cook hacking up ducks at NY Noodletown is languid at best -- but the compensations are everywhere for the few patrons. One recent afternoon a street vendor actually greeted me when I stopped to examine his greens. Waiters were unfailingly patient, even solicitous. With streets less clogged, I could walk on the sidewalk instead of in traffic and get close enough to the open-front seafood markets to see that one big barrel was full of squirming frogs, that a tank was slithering with eels, and that nearly all the fish gleamed with freshness.
Most restaurants have cut back in various ways. Dim Sum Go Go in Chatham Square has let go half its employees, and some days Sweet-n-Tart Cafe closes at 11 p.m. instead of midnight. Others are offering discounts, like the 10 percent reduction given weekdays at New Wonton Garden on Mott Street. A group of restaurateurs has banded with local and city organizations to run flashy campaigns in windows, newspapers and tourist literature to lure patrons back around the lazy susans.
Ms. Fields is organizing a "Manhattan Night Out" tomorrow to bring 300 to 400 business and civic leaders into Chinatown "to visit the shops and eat in the restaurants to boost the businesses that are still not coming back as quickly as the owners need." They in turn, she hopes, will spread the word that Chinatown is open. 
Unlike Little Italy, which it abuts and partially surrounds, Chinatown has evolved over the last 20 years, particularly as new immigrants from Hong Kong have invested in the neighborhood. A better name for the area, in fact, would be Asia City now that so many Malaysian, Thai and Vietnamese restaurants have opened in the congested blocks north and south of Canal Street. Many are lavishly designed, and they have been joined by sleek tea salons catering to a hip young crowd with pearl tea jazzed up with tapioca, and by very modern bakeries that would be at home on upper Madison Avenue if not for the steamed pork buns sold along with the French-inspired pastries.
Chinatown is now being promoted with Little Italy and Harlem in a get-out-the- diners campaign by NYC & Company, the city's convention and visitors bureau. Business in those other neighborhoods is also off by 45 to 50 percent, according to the bureau, but Chinatown is easily the most competitive restaurant environment.
That handy gazetteer the Zagat Survey lists 36 restaurants in the area bounded by Hester Street on the north, Lafayette Street on the west and Allen and Pike Streets on the east. But on Sunday I counted 26 restaurants open and one closed just on the four blocks of Mott Street between Canal and Chatham Square. And that did not include all the bakeries and tea salons on that stretch, or the Hong Kong cake stall with the long line at Mosco Street.
Even before Sept. 11, the ground had started shifting under Chinatown. Already more and more immigrants -- and restaurateurs -- were settling in Sunset Park in Brooklyn or in Elmhurst and Flushing in Queens, where rents are lower. The closing of the Grand Street subway stop last summer had slowed pedestrian traffic. And increasingly there was competition closer in, from trendy Asian spots in NoLIta like Funky Broome and Clay.
After Sept. 11, things got radically worse with restrictions on traffic and telephone service for weeks. The smell from the wreckage still lingers on some days.
Cooks and busboys had difficulty getting to work when the neighborhood was sealed off, and only those with identification were allowed in. "These workers don't have ID," said Eileen Leong, the manager of Canton on Division Street. Her restaurant had to close for two days after the attacks because it had no staff in place.
Worse, the courthouses were shut down initially. Most places in Chinatown operate on margins so tight that any drop in business is brutal. On a good day it's hard to make a profit on $3.50 beef. Lose a few days of jurors' lunches and things get scary. 
E. Charles Hunt, president of the local chapter of the New York Restaurant Association, said a drop of just 20 percent in sales could put a restaurant at risk, even if it laid off staff and cut purchases. The last quarter of the year is especially important, he added, because restaurants do 40 percent of their business then.
Many workers in Chinatown indicated that cutbacks had already begun. On the afternoon I stopped into NY Noodletown to buy a couple of roast ducks the place was so weirdly quiet that I could ask the usually swamped cashier how business had been. She gestured: down, down. "I work only four days now," she said.
Kenny Wong, the manager of Ping's, the acclaimed seafood restaurant on Mott Street, said he had had to lay off workers, especially while the phone service was out. "If no one knows you're open," he said, "you close."
Colette Rossant, a partner in Dim Sum Go Go, said that her sales had dropped from $4,000 a day to $1,500, which is not enough to pay the rent.
At Joe's Shanghai on Pell Street, Raymond Wong, the manager, said business was starting to build on weekends but was still down 30 percent overall. And so he had had to lay off 6 of his 30 waiters and cooks and cut hours for those still working.
While he, Kenny Wong and Ms. Leong all said business was virtually back to normal last weekend, they each attributed the rebound to the holiday and the resulting influx of visitors. "If hotels don't get full, I don't," Ms. Leong said.
Many Chinatown workers, Raymond Wong said, are relying on emergency cash from private groups like Safe Horizon. Immigration issues apparently keep some workers from trying to file for government benefits. Others were paid in cash, off the books, and are not eligible for help, according to John Wang, president of the Asian American Business Development Center. And their empty pockets have a ripple effect throughout Chinatown, in the butcher shops and fish stores as well as the restaurants.
Some restaurateurs have turned the disaster to advantage, though. Bo Ky, a Vietnamese place on Bayard Street that shut down for lack of business after losing its phone service, is now undergoing a complete renovation thanks to a $60,000 loan from the Small Business Administration. Chi Vy Ngo, an owner, said the restaurant had been heavily dependent on business from the World Trade Center, and on takeout orders picked up by car. After the streets closed, so did he. Meantime, he has asked his 11 full-time employees to hang on until he reopens.
Some of the biggest restaurants seem to be bouncing back fastest. Golden Unicorn on East Broadway has 600 seats, yet the general manager, Peter Yau, said sales are now down a mere 10 percent. At their worst, in September, they dropped only 30 percent, he said.
What made the difference was the restaurant's focus on wedding banquets. After Sept. 11, Mr. Yau said, "they didn't cancel, they postponed." Most of the guests come from the metropolitan area, he said, so he is not feeling the drop in tourism and travel.
For Thanksgiving, in fact, Golden Unicorn was fully booked, Mr. Yau said, since the holiday has become a popular occasion for Asian weddings. At 2 in the afternoon on the Sunday after the big day, every table on two floors of the restaurant was occupied, and lines of people waited to be seated.
My own experience at dim sum best brought home why so many in Chinatown are optimistic, even insistent that, as Paul Lee, an assistant to the president of the Chinese Consolidated Benevolent Association, put it: "Business is going to come back, but whether it's sooner or later we can't figure out."
The places that live by the tourists may die by the absence of tourists. But those like Triple Eight Palace that depend on New Yorkers may be able to keep the woks fired for the long term. Even on the Sunday before Thanksgiving, the four people in my party were among the few Caucasians waiting to be seated while the M.C. at a big Chinese wedding shouted through a microphone in the sprawling restaurant, in the Broadway Mall under the Manhattan Bridge.
Considering the noise, the absence of English and the surfeit of tripe, chicken feet and pork balls, we could have been on an eating expedition to another continent. It felt as far from Manhattan -- and ground zero -- as we could possibly get without braving a river or an airport. And the credit card machines were working.

HEADLINE: Egypt Puts Up Vacancy Signs 

BYLINE:  By ABEER ALLAM

DATELINE: CAIRO, Nov. 27 

 BODY:
The developers who initially conceived of building Egypt's first private airport three years ago had visions of tourists by the thousands whisked every week from Europe's cold, gray winter directly to the warm sunshine and azure waters of a $1.2 billion resort on Egypt's southern Red Sea coast.
 But when the Marsa Alam International Airport opened earlier this month, it attracted just one weekly flight, from Germany. 
 Egypt's tourism and aviation industries are reeling from the aftershocks of the Sept. 11 terror attacks. Foreign tourists are shunning the country, afraid of flying and of any possible spillover from the fighting in Afghanistan. Hotels are closed, international airlines are scratching Egypt as a destination, and sales are eroding markedly even in tangential industries like alcoholic beverages. 
Tourism is crucial to Egypt's economy. The country drew 5.4 million visitors in 2000 despite tensions and violence elsewhere in the Middle East, and with a number of luxury projects under construction, including the development at Marsa Alam, the government had hopes of bettering that figure by 400,000 this year. Tourism is the government's largest source of revenue -- $4.3 billion in 2000 -- and it accounts for 10 percent of Egypt's gross domestic product. About 2.2 million Egyptians have jobs related to tourism.
But the signs are grim. "Tourist activity in October dropped 40 to 45 percent," the tourism minister, Mamdou el-Beltagi, told the state-owned Middle East News Agency. "The coming months will witness a larger drop in reservations due to cancellations by a number of tourist companies."
Egyptian hotels and travel agencies are reporting thousands of group cancellations. Even the most famous hotels, once considered immune to recession, are reporting occupancy rates of 50 percent or less and laying off workers. Some beach hotels have closed entirely.
"It is the worst crisis since the gulf war in 1991," said Osman Abaza, public relations manager for Mena House Oberoi, a century-old five-star hotel at the base of the Giza Pyramids. "We have only 40 percent occupancy, although the hotel was fully booked until January."
So far, the hotel has closed 200 rooms, four of its eight restaurants, one of its bars and a nightclub, and it has laid off all part-time employees.
Mr. Abaza is at a loss to say how the cancellations might be reversed.
"We cannot do anything about it," he said. "Lowering prices or launching promotion campaigns will not help. People are simply afraid of taking airplanes -- they are not coming in the first place."
Aside from some of the wonders of the ancient world, the main tourist attractions in Egypt are the beaches and coral reefs of the Red Sea and Sinai Peninsula. Nearly 80 percent of the foreign visitors to Egypt have been Europeans; Americans make up only 4 percent.
Trouble started for the Sinai resorts in September 2000, when an outbreak of violent clashes between Israelis and Palestinians severely crimped the flow of the resorts' mainstay visitors, tourists from Israel; 430,000 came in the first half of 2000, but fewer than 37,000 showed up in the comparable period this year.
"Forty percent of our clients are Israelis," said Roger Tabet, managing director of Orascom Hotel Holdings, the owners of a plush Sinai resort at Taba Heights near the Israeli border. "We were hit badly after the Palestinian uprising had broken out."
The events of Sept. 11 have spread the pain to the rest of the country, with airlines and other transportation companies suffering heavy losses and Egyptian travel agencies and tour packagers reporting inbound trade down by at least half compared with a year ago.
"We spent the first 10 days after the attack doing nothing but refunding to clients," said Hisham Hassan, an agent at Star of Egypt Travel in Cairo. "In two days, 60 percent of the airplane tickets were canceled."
Both Orascom and the Kharafi Group, the Kuwaiti company that is developing Marsa Alam, say they are pressing ahead with construction despite the slump. They hope that by the time their projects are completed in a few years, tourism will have picked up again. Plans at Marsa Alam include the biggest marina in the Middle East.
Meanwhile, though, air service to Egypt remains profoundly disrupted. Delta Air Lines, which had been set to replace Trans World Airlines by January 2002 as the sole American carrier flying nonstop between New York and Cairo, now says it will not fly the route before March 15. Malaysia Airlines announced that it would stop flying to Cairo on Jan. 1.
The damage has also been severe at EgyptAir, the national airline, which employs more than 20,000 people. "Our passengers dropped by 40 percent, and our operations have been cut by 15 percent since the attack," said Abdel Azim Sedqi, a spokesman for the airline.
In early November the minister of transportation, Ibrahim al-Dumeiri, put the aviation sector's total losses since Sept. 11 at $82 million, with three-quarters of those losses at EgyptAir.
EgyptAir has cut the domestic fares charged to foreign tourists by 40 percent and fares for Egyptians by 15 percent. Scheduled flights to Karachi, Pakistan; Osaka, Japan; and Sana and Aden in Yemen have been dropped, and the airline's two weekly flights to Los Angeles have also been suspended temporarily.

 CORRECTION:
A picture caption in World Business on Nov. 28 about a decline in visitors to Egypt and its attractions referred incorrectly to the history of the Luxor Temple. It was not the site of a massacre of 58 tourists in 1997; that was the Hatshepsut Temple.

Statistics, a Tool for Life, Is Getting Short Shrift

BYLINE:  By Richard Rothstein; E-mail: rrothstein@nytimes.com

DATELINE: BOGART, Ga. 

 BODY:
MANY educators want all high school seniors prepared for calculus. That means taking algebra in the eighth grade and covering geometry, intermediate algebra and trigonometry by the junior year. This leaves too little room for study of statistics and probability.
 Yet students need grounding in data analysis. The push for universal calculus has relied on a false belief that colleges and future jobs would demand it. Yet while calculus is important for college students who major in science and for the scientific literacy of others, only a few jobs, mostly in technical fields, actually use it. 
 Nationwide, educators who recognize this imbalance are trying to get more statistics into the math curriculum. 
One place this is happening is Malcom Bridge Middle School, about 60 miles east of Atlanta. There, Jamie Parker recently taught seventh graders to make graphs called scatterplots in which an X depicted the relationship between two aspects of body size the students had measured. The graphs showed each student's wrist and ankle circumference, or height and arm span, or length of pointer finger and longest toe.
Mrs. Parker showed the 12-year-olds how someone (at a newspaper, for example) could report data accurately but display them deceptively -- for example, by changing the scale on one side of a graph to make an apparent correlation seem less important.
Meanwhile, down the road at Oconee County High School, Steven Messig's advanced placement statistics class used a list of random numbers to select five students from each of 20 math and science classes. The 100 subjects came to Mr. Messig's room for a double-blind taste test of Pepsi and Coke. Two students poured drinks in random order. Others gave out cups, not knowing in which order they did so and then recording the taste each subject preferred.
Wouldn't it have been easier to test a few complete classes rather than randomly select from many? Kelly Blount, a senior, explained that socially similar students might take the same classes, so each room might not be representative. For example, Kelly explained, students from wealthier families tend to value education more and might take more difficult classes. If those people also tend to have common tastes in what they drink, preferences of students in some rooms might differ from those of students chosen randomly.
Later, as these students analyze their data, Kelly may learn to say a "convenience sample" could be "biased" if drawn from a homogeneous subgroup. Students may be able to explain their "confidence" in the generalizability of results from a sample of the school's 1,800 students -- what the "interval," or range of results, might be if other groups were randomly selected. Using computers and graphing calculators, Mr. Messig's students will design several ways to display their findings.
In 2006, when Mrs. Parker's seventh graders are ready for an advanced placement class in statistics, they could already know much of this math. This knowledge will be important because common debates about health, justice, economic and legal policy all assume familiarity with statistics. It is no longer possible to serve competently on some juries without more data skills than most college graduates have.
Clifford Konold, a professor at the University of Massachusetts, counted data displays in The New York Times. Dr. Konold found that in 1972 there were four graphs or tables in 10 consecutive weekday editions of The Times, excluding the sports and business sections. There were 8 in 1982 and 44 in 1992. Next year, he could find more than 100.
Interpreting these requires not only different skills from conventional mathematics, but a different way of thinking. Geometry and calculus concern proof. Statistics describe uncertainty. This change in orientation makes it hard to expand statistics instruction. Math teachers often resist placing it in the regular course of study because, despite having math degrees, they do not know how to teach statistics. Parents and counselors also balk, wanting no time taken from calculus.
Mr. Messig's elective statistics course this year enrolled only nine students. Because their statistical backgrounds are weak, Mr. Messig is taking twice the typical time to cover the material.
But his students never benefited from Mrs. Parker's middle school instruction. Her math class includes data analysis because the State of Georgia, influenced by standards of the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics, now tests if seventh graders are learning it. Mrs. Parker's textbook this year includes more statistics than the old one.
If the trend continues nationwide, this newspaper could someday report that an apparently alarming cluster of cancer cases has arisen in an innocuous normal distribution, and students will be able to explain to their parents what that means.

HEADLINE: What New York Will Have to Give Up 

BYLINE:  By Steven Rattner; Steven Rattner is managing principal of the Quadrangle Group, an investment firm.

 BODY:
By now, only the most inattentive New Yorker could be unaware of the multibillion-dollar budget deficit awaiting the new mayor. Add to that well-known financial worry another, less visible one: an onerous $40 billion debt load.
 The city's quick flip from surplus to deficit -- exacerbated by the economic fallout from Sept. 11 -- may deserve the headlines, but the debt load limits what the city can do to address that deficit. 
 According to the city comptroller, Alan G. Hevesi, New York has 50 percent more debt per resident than any other major American city and nearly double what it had a decade ago. That's not even counting another mountain of debt used to finance activities like transit and the water system. 
Most confining, 15 cents of every dollar of city tax revenue must now go to make payments on the city's debts, almost as much as the combined cost of police, fire and sanitation. According to city budget projections, that debt service figure is headed for 20 cents in 2004, a level not seen since the early 80's, when the city was emerging from its worst fiscal crisis.
In the 1990's the city's leaders seem to have believed that unending prosperity would provide the resources to absorb the costs of the borrowing. That proved to be a bad bet.
In a period of growth, when the city should have been giving itself breathing room to prepare for the inevitable rainy day, the cost of its debt was growing faster than its sources of revenue, like citizens' incomes and the market value of its taxable properties. Well before the economic downturn and the Sept. 11 attacks, New York City's debt exceeded what Standard and Poor's considers to be high by several different measures -- even though the city continues to carry A ratings.
To be fair, the money went for an important purpose -- trying to address an infrastructure still creaking from the draconian cuts of the 1970's. While New York may still seem like an old city, billions have been spent on fixing roads and bridges, building schools and water treatment plants and the like. Using debt also provided room to pare back the city's maze of suffocating taxes. All of this helped improve the city's quality of life. But even in the late 90's, when the Wall Street boom brought a windfall in tax collections, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani resisted calls from fiscal watchdogs to pay some of the infrastructure costs out of current revenue rather than by borrowing.
Today's fiscal circumstances remain less worrisome than those in the 70's, when New York was near bankruptcy. So far, at least the city is not borrowing to pay its day-to-day bills. Its accounting practices -- once a grab bag of gimmicks and obfuscations -- now get deservedly high marks for clarity. And pension funds for city workers have healthy balances.
But building the debt to its current level has involved some maneuvering. In 1997 the city reached its debt limit under the New York State Constitution; to avoid being shut out from borrowing, it got the state to agree to the creation of a new financing authority to circumvent the limit. Two years later, another new legal entity was created to allow the city to borrow against its share of proceeds from a settlement of a federal lawsuit against tobacco companies.
What to expect now? Unfortunately, even more pain than the looming budget deficit implies. Convinced that further improvements to New York's infrastructure are urgent, the Giuliani administration this year reaffirmed long-term capital planning that raises spending on pressing infrastructure needs, particularly school construction and repair. This spending would be financed largely with debt, creating obligations that would, in turn, impose imprudent burdens on the city in a weakening economy.
The temptation to go forward with the capital spending will be high, but as we search for solutions to our problems, we must be careful not to exacerbate them. Even transitional borrowing must be repaid. And clever ideas for financial engineering, like financing infrastructure projects by selling new city bonds to the pension funds of municipal unions, will just add more debt, compounding the problem of how to pay all the interest and principal.
We can get some help from refinancing debt at today's low interest rates, as well as from tough discipline on spending. Even so, the city will need federal assistance -- in the form of grants, not loans or even loan guarantees.
New York's vibrancy, unique among American cities, must be maintained. But preserving it won't avert the necessity of another period of austerity and sacrifice. And we must be careful not to saddle future generations with unsustainable burdens.

Shares Fall on Unexpected Drop in Consumer Confidence

BYLINE:  By Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
Stocks fell yesterday, sending the Dow Jones industrial average to its biggest loss this month, after consumer confidence slid to its lowest level in seven and a half years.
 The Conference Board reported that its index of consumer confidence fell to 82.2 this month, as Americans' assessment of current conditions declined. 
 "We got blindsided by the consumer confidence number," said Michael Lyons, a trader at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter. "It was orderly selling after a good run," he said. 
The Dow has gained 20 percent and the Nasdaq composite index has jumped 36 percent from the post-attack lows of Sept. 21 on optimism that the economy will recover because of lower interest rates combined with the spending increases and tax cuts Congress is considering.
The Dow Jones industrial average fell 110.15 points yesterday, or 1.1 percent, to 9,872.60. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index declined 7.92 points, or 0.7 percent, to 1,149.50. The Nasdaq composite index dropped 5.26 points, or 0.3 percent, to 1,935.97.
Analysts had forecast that the consumer confidence index from the Conference Board, an economic research group, would rise this month.
"We may be entering a period of a few weeks where companies will say that their fourth-quarter profits are lousy," said Stanley Nabi, who manages $1 billion at Credit Suisse Asset Management. While benchmark indexes may fall a few percentage points in reaction, "it's not a big new down leg," he said.
Home Depot, the home-improvement retailer, declined for a second day, falling $2.17, to $43.35. It accounted for the biggest share of the Dow's loss as investors and analysts expect its chief executive, Robert L. Nardelli, to lower the forecast of profit growth for next year.
Bristol-Myers Squibb fell $1.35, to $54, amid expectations that it might soon lose its bid to persuade lawmakers to extend its exclusive rights to the diabetes medicine Glucophage, prompting some analysts to cut 2002 earnings projections.
Rambus, which licenses patented memory chip technology, slid 68 cents, to $9.41. Lawyers for the German chip maker Infineon Technologies said Rambus would be barred from filing patent infringement suits against Infineon under a judge's order.
Intel gained 44 cents, to $32.31, limiting declines in the Nasdaq after the company's chief financial officer said demand for semiconductors was meeting expectations at the company, the No. 1 chip maker. --------------------

Treasury Prices Rise
By Reuters
Treasury bond prices rose yesterday after a Federal Reserve governor, Laurence H. Meyer, signaled that the Fed had more room to cut interest rates.
Mr. Meyer, known as one of the Fed's hawkish members on inflation, said that holding back on monetary easing because of low rates was a "misguided strategy."
The 10-year Treasury note rose 23/32, to a price of 100 20/32. The note's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, fell to 4.92 percent from 5.01 percent on Monday.
The price of the 30-year Treasury bond rose 22/32, to 100 21/32. The bond's yield fell to 5.33 percent from 5.38 percent on Monday.

HEADLINE: Kmart's Adjusted Loss Almost Doubles but Is Less Than Forecast 

BYLINE:  By CONSTANCE L. HAYS 

 BODY:
The Kmart Corporation posted a wider quarterly loss yesterday as it struggled to reinvent itself in a shriveling economy, and its credit rating was lowered further below investment grade.
 The loss was $224 million, or 45 cents a share, in the quarter ended Oct. 31, compared with a loss of $67 million, or 14 cents a share, in the period a year earlier. Sales fell 2.2 percent, to $8.02 billion. 
 Adjusted for one-time charges, the loss was $127 million, or 25 cents a share, nearly twice as large as the loss in the quarter a year earlier. On that basis, the loss was less than the 27 cents a share expected by analysts, according to Thomson Financial/First Call.
Standard & Poor's lowered the company's credit rating another notch below investment grade, to BB from BB+. "We had expected to see good improvement in operations as well as in credit measures," said Mary Lou Burde, a director of corporate ratings for the agency. Kmart was last at the BB rating in March 1999, Ms. Burde said. 
Shares of Kmart, which is based in Troy, Mich., fell 47 cents yesterday, to $6.38. The shares are down 53 percent from Aug. 8, when the price reached a high of $13.55. 
The chief executive, Charles C. Conaway, who was hired in May 2000, has promised investors a turnaround. In September last year, he set a two-year timetable for himself, but many analysts think he will be hard pressed to meet that.
Mr. Conaway spent $94 million to replace two distribution centers and to install inventory software. He also added self-checkout registers in more than 1,000 stores. 
A contract with the Fleming Companies, a distributor, that makes it the sole supplier of food and other products allowed Kmart to reduce the cost of stocking food. As a result, gross profit, or sales minus the cost of goods sold, widened to 20.6 percent from 20.5 percent a year earlier.

HEADLINE: How Secure Is Pakistan's Plutonium? 

BYLINE:  By Mansoor Ijaz and R. James Woolsey; Mansoor Ijaz, a nuclear scientist, is chairman of Crescent Investment Management in New York; his father was a pioneer in Pakistan's nuclear program. R. James Woolsey, an attorney, was director of central intelligence from 1993 to 1995.

 BODY:
A deeply disturbing picture of terrorist intent has emerged in recent weeks as blueprints for building nuclear weapons have been discovered in the wreckage of abandoned Al Qaeda safe houses. These blueprints and other documents, while largely available in the public domain, sharpen the need for a vigorous American policy to deal with unsecured nuclear, chemical and biological materials. Even if terrorist manufacture of nuclear bombs is unlikely, substantial dangers remain of terrorists using radioactive material in low-tech "dirty" bombs. 
 The main nuclear security problem posed by Al Qaeda today is access to radioactive materials in Pakistan. However, for a decade we have focused on the former Soviet Union. Since the end of the cold war, approximately 175 incidents of smuggling or attempted theft of nuclear materials there have been thwarted. But the threat remains, as the Russian Defense Ministry reported on Nov. 6, when the last attempt at theft was made. 
 For Russia, a sensible solution is available -- the Nunn-Lugar "cooperative threat reduction" program to improve the security of Russia's nuclear materials, technology and expertise. This week, the House Republican leadership will decide whether to finance the next phase. The program is only 40 percent complete; finishing it will take another quarter of a century at the current rate of funding. It is past time to fully implement and finance this important legislation.
The Nunn-Lugar initiative can serve as a valuable precedent in addressing security problems in Pakistan. Neither Pakistan nor India has signed the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty or the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. Nor has either country engaged in negotiations, under the auspices of the United Nations Conference on Disarmament, to protect against theft of fissile materials. This reluctance in India and Pakistan to recognize international norms, however, should not alter our resolve to improve the security of nuclear materials in South Asia.
While Islamabad is widely believed to have the material for 25 to 40 medium-yield bombs, most of its nuclear devices are kept in component parts, not as assembled warheads. The storage procedures, quite elaborate prior to Sept. 11, were altered again on Oct. 7 when the American bombing of Afghanistan began. Separately stored uranium and plutonium cores and their detonation assemblies were moved to six new secret locations around the country.
The new storage patterns were designed to allow for rapid assembly and deployment, but attackers will nonetheless find it much more difficult to confiscate Pakistan's nuclear weapons. Even if Al Qaeda obtained radioactive materials from a sympathizer at one of Pakistan's plants for making weapons-grade nuclear materials, as some reports have suggested, the material would still have to be shaped into a fissionable core with detonation switches and delivery housings.
Such a complex effort would be difficult to carry out in an Afghan cave. But we can hardly count on terrorists always being under bombardment in caves.
Pakistan's nuclear command hierarchy, overhauled in 2000, was also revamped on Oct. 7 in the wake of a broad military-intelligence shake-up. Pakistan's president and army chief, Pervez Musharraf, created the strategic planning division and appointed a moderate general, Khalid Kidwai, to oversee Pakistani nuclear assets.
Self-policing, however, is not enough. Since 1990, American sanctions have blocked sale or transfer of any technology that might have a military use -- including technologies that would improve nuclear security. American export license controls -- and, where necessary, Non-Proliferation Treaty and Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty compliance rules preventing United States exports -- should be waived to transfer the technology needed to protect Pakistan's nuclear arsenals and materials from unauthorized use.
The Bush administration should make available American vaults, sensors, alarms, tamper-proof seals, closed-circuit cameras and labels to identify, track and secure Islamabad's nuclear materials.
Such precautions would dramatically reduce the probability that even the most devoted bin Laden supporter inside a Pakistani nuclear enrichment facility would get very far in trying to deliver stolen uranium or plutonium to terrorists.
There is a real risk that Pakistan's fanatics might collaborate with Al Qaeda; the plans, recently discovered in Kabul, for a helium balloon armed with anthrax have been attributed to a Pakistani nuclear scientist turned Taliban philanthropist. But the risk is manageable if we can help the Musharraf government focus on this threat, as Russia has done in the Nunn-Lugar cooperative threat reduction program.
Unless we follow such a course, we face the very real possibility of terrorist militias obtaining not just blueprints but the materials to fashion and detonate weapons of mass destruction. We also risk sharpening the debate in Pakistani military and political circles about whether its nuclear expertise should be shared with other Muslim countries. It is hard to think of two developments that are less in our interest.

HEADLINE: The Neediest Cases; 
Jobs Lost, Found and Lost, But a Life Still to Be Led

BYLINE:  By VINCENT M. MALLOZZI 

 BODY:
David Johnson's Sunday morning routine was two-thirds complete. he had already phoned his two daughters to say "I love you," and he had already delivered an I-love-you in person to his mother, who lives near his South Bronx apartment. "And now," Mr. Johnson said, his fingers dancing in anticipation on his computer keyboard as he spoke, "it's time for The Times." Reaching beneath his keyboard for the classified section of The New York Times, Mr. Johnson began the third phase of his routine: looking for a job. As he held the section in his hands, Mr. Johnson's eyebrows went north. He lifted it into the air, then bounced it lightly as if he were weighing it on an imaginary scale. 
 "It's so light this week, there really aren't that many pages," Mr. Johnson said, a short smile running away from his face. 
 "I'd like to think that the people who post these jobs were all away for Thanksgiving," he said, "but I'm sure that the reality has more to do with the shape of the economy."
Mr. Johnson, 33, has been working at temporary jobs and looking for steady work since February of last year, when budget restrictions forced him out of a permanent job at the United Nations. He had worked there for three years as a video-imaging operator, processing passports for United Nations employees who traveled abroad.
Since he lost that job, Mr. Johnson has lost a lot more.
"I broke up with Lynette in May of last year," said Mr. Johnson, referring to his wife and childhood sweetheart, with whom he has been involved for the past 17 years. "And my house is a lot lonelier without my two little girls."
Separated but not divorced, Mr. Johnson still sees his daughters every day, but getting there is a little more difficult than it used to be. What was once a five-minute car ride to visit his girls -- Lyndaiza, 9, and Lyndae, 1, who live with their mother and maternal grandmother a few neighborhoods away -- has become at least a half-hour walk. 
"My 1987 Maxima is still in my mother's driveway," Mr. Johnson said. "When it broke down, I just couldn't afford to get it fixed."
By the time his car broke down in August, so had Mr. Johnson's financial state. His credit cards were canceled, and he had fallen two months behind in his rent. Though he had been getting an unemployment check of $353 each week since May, it was not enough to cover his bills.
"I was just juggling money, trying to pay one bill here and one bill there," he said. "I was doing the best I could, but then everything just sort of collapsed on me."
Mr. Johnson reached out to the Federation of Protestant Welfare Agencies, one of the seven charities supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund. 
The agency wrote Mr. Johnson's landlord a check for $998.27, which covered the rent for July and August. "It really helped," Mr. Johnson said. "It gave me a little chance to regroup."
In July, Mr. Johnson had taken a temporary job as a word processor for a law firm on the 89th floor of 1 World Trade Center. He had hoped the job would become permanent. Fortunately for him, that job ended before Sept. 11. 
"Eight morning people I knew, people who were 8:30 on-the-dotters," said Mr. Johnson, his voice trailing off into a whisper, "are all dead." And when Mr. Johnson realized he would lose his job at the United Nations, he applied for another one there that he really wanted -- to be part of an observation mission in Georgia, the former Soviet Republic. But shortly before that mission got under way, Mr. Johnson was informed that he lost out to another candidate. 
As it turned out, two members of that mission were kidnapped by armed men. (Marie Okabe, a United Nations spokeswoman, said this week that the two men were eventually released unharmed.) 
"With all the hard luck I've had, I look back at those two potential jobs and realize how lucky I was not to get either one of them," said Mr. Johnson, who was sending resumes out by e-mail as he spoke. "It makes you wonder if in this lifetime, God really does have a special plan for each and every one of us."

HEADLINE: Business Travel; 
Private charters, although languishing this year, are expected to fill a future air travel niche.

BYLINE:  By Joe Sharkey; The Business Travel column appears each Wednesday. E-mail: jsharkey@nytimes.com.

 BODY:
AIR fares dropped 19.2 percent last month compared with October 2000, according to the Air Transport Association's Office of Economics.
 Cheaper fares didn't put more customers in the seats, though. Domestic passenger traffic was off 22 percent, and the number of people flying internationally on domestic airlines fell 31 percent in October, the airline trade association said. 
 Yet this sharp numerical drop in passengers occurred on an air transportation system that has about 20 percent fewer seats available than it did just a few months ago. "The airlines have basically taken a meat ax to capacity," said Jim Altschul, the president of Aviation Advisory Services, an airline financial consulting firm. 
So it's probably not the best of times to be laying down any heavy bets on any segment of the air travel market. Still, some industry experts are looking a bit farther down the road than this year or next and seeing signs of what could be a fundamental shift in business travel, which has long been the most profitable market for commercial airlines.
Here's one speculative observation worth considering, from Michael Dyment, a partner in Andersen, the financial consulting firm: "In my view, 10 years from now business travelers, generally speaking, are not going to be flying commercial. There will be alternatives that will be much more cost-effective," he said in a recent interview.
Mr. Dyment predicts that significant numbers of business travelers are eventually going to end up on private aircraft. They'll be transported on planes owned in whole or in part by their companies, or on charter flights, including some on fixed schedules, he said.
The reason, he said, is pure economics, underscored by a sharper front-office appreciation of efficient mobility and good employee morale as important components of shareholder value.
"One of the things we were working on prior to Sept. 11 was the issue of business-traveler productivity and the sort of anger that was becoming a real groundswell in corporate America" over deteriorating commercial airline service that routinely sentenced increasingly frustrated business travelers to spend many wasted hours getting to, and getting out of, airports.
"This had become utterly deleterious for business travelers," Mr. Dyment said. Since delays and frustrations began mounting in 1999 and 2000, he added, "people have been looking for alternatives."
"And they still are," he continued. "That's why this business aviation boom we've been seeing in recent years is not just a blip on the radar screen."
Currently, with the aviation system still reeling from the terrorist attacks, there are no firm data supporting any idea of an imminent major shift in the way people travel.
For example, recent surveys suggest that business travel has rebounded to near-normal levels, while leisure travel remains sharply off. But it's more difficult to identify the business travel dollar these days, because earlier this year corporations angry about high fares began sending many corporate travelers out on the less convenient, lower-fare advance-purchase tickets typically used by leisure travelers.
In recent years, the corporate jet industry grew about 30 percent annually, spurred by the increasing popularity of programs that allow corporations to buy fractional shares in private jets.
The airlines have been paying attention to that. Earlier this year, UAL, the corporate parent of United Airlines, set up a subsidiary called Avolar that plans to market private jets through fractional leases and also to operate charter and shuttle services for corporate and private clients. In a sign of the vitality of that market, Avolar, which plans to begin flight operations next year, announced last week an agreement with Airbus Industrie, the European aircraft manufacturer, to add 15 high-end, large-cabin Airbus Corporate Jetliner models to its fleet.
And Air Charter Guide, the publisher of a major directory for the air-charter industry, did a survey in late October that found charter bookings were up significantly among many operators after Sept. 11.
Jet Aviation Inc., a private-aviation services company that also describes itself as the largest supplier of charter flights in the United States, expects eventually to see a bigger shift to charter flights and other uses of corporate aircraft, once the terrorism emergency and the current recession wane.
"Are we seeing it right now? No," said Jamie Barrett, the senior vice president for charter services. "After the events of Sept. 11, we saw a spike in demand" partly attributable to getting stranded travelers back home, he said. "We had a quick boost there for about a 10-day or a two-week period." But Jet Aviation's charter business will probably be off 30 percent this year, he said.
"The unknown quantity is what the airlines are going to do" after the holidays, he said. "How much more are they going to trim to try to get to profitable levels?"
Along with regional carriers, the charter industry expects to be able to "take up the slack" if, as expected, money-losing airlines eliminate more routes and services even after robust travel resumes, Mr. Barrett said, adding that charters can offer prices that compete with premium airline fares.
"You take a corporate business jet and put 8 to 10 people in the airplane and, depending on the route structure, and it gets very, very close" to the cost of a first-class ticket on a commercial flight, and with better scheduling efficiency and fewer security problems, he said.
However the system finally shakes out, Mr. Dyment of Andersen says that the new era in air transport will have to be considerably different from the old one, where many business travelers were in open revolt in their companies about the travails of the air over the last two years.
At Andersen, "we have 85,000 people and on any given day in the U.S. and Canada, we have between 2,000 and 3,000 people on airlines," he said. "That's a large number of people. So we been examining very closely the productivity problems of our travelers."
Before the economy tightened up, Andersen, like other companies that do a lot of travel, found that "the No. 1 or No. 2 reason" that valued executives who left the firm cited for their departure "was always the travel, how terrible it was, and how nonproductive and frustrating."
He added, "Business travel is going to continue to grow in leaps and bounds" in years ahead. As companies assess future travel, "I think there's already a large new movement toward business aviation, though it's not public because companies aren't flaunting it now."

HEADLINE: Aquarium Bonds Worth 25 Cents on Dollar 

BYLINE:  Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: MARINELAND, Fla., Nov. 27 

 BODY:
Bondholders in the oceanside aquarium in Marineland, Florida's smallest town, are getting 25 cents on the dollar for their investment. 
 The Marineland Foundation Inc., a nonprofit corporation that the City of Marineland set up in 1996 to buy the vintage-1937 attraction, began paying investors $245 for every $1,000 invested on Nov. 9, according to a letter sent to investors this week by the bond trustee, the State Street Bank and Trust Company. 
 The Florida tourist attraction was refurbished with the proceeds of an unrated high-yield municipal bond. Sold during the 1990's to build everything from recycling operations to racetracks and theme parks, so-called economic development bonds have defaulted at a rate of more than 15 percent, compared with a rate of less than 1 percent for traditional municipal bonds, according to a study by Fitch Investors Service. 
The $9.7 million Marineland bonds were first sold in 1995 at yields of 8 1/2 percent in minimum denominations of $100,000. 
The feasibility study attached to the bond issue said that Marineland needed 150,000 visitors a year to break even. In 1997, the park brought in 118,000, and the prices of the bonds began their long slide. 
The agreement reached among bondholders, the bond trustee and Marine Park of Flagler, a company owned by the Atlanta real estate developer James F. Jacoby, allowed the park to stay open.

Fire Could Not Stop A Mill, but Debts May

BYLINE:  By LYNNLEY BROWNING 

 BODY:
It is another unhappy holiday season for Aaron M. Feuerstein, the widely admired New England mill owner whose textile company, Malden Mills, is again in crisis.
 After a December fire six years ago ravaged much of his factory in Lawrence, Mass., Mr. Feuerstein won plaudits for rebuilding the mill from top to bottom and for paying his idled workers for months. By the time the new factory -- which makes Polartec and Polarfleece, the warm, synthetic fabrics popular in outdoor clothing -- reopened nearly two years later, he had rehired most of his 2,700 employees. In an era of widespread corporate downsizing, his actions made Mr. Feuerstein a national icon of corporate sensitivity. 
 Now the private company, founded by Mr. Feuerstein's grandfather in 1906, is mired in debt and facing bankruptcy amid questions about whether Mr. Feuerstein's past benevolence helped bring the company to its present precarious state. 
"It may have been that the desire to take a principled action somehow blinded him to thinking long term," said Barbara Lee Toffler, an adjunct professor at Columbia University's Graduate School of Business and an expert on corporate responsibility.
Mr. Feuerstein could have retired with around $300 million in insurance payouts after the fire in 1995 or moved his company to a source of cheaper labor in the South or in Mexico.
But Malden Mills is the largest employer in one of Massachusetts' poorest towns, and instead he chose to spend a total of $430 million to build a gleaming updated textile mill next to the fire-damaged site. When the factory reopened, President Bill Clinton hailed Mr. Feuerstein as a model corporate citizen. Newspapers, magazines and television programs sang his praises.
Mr. Feuerstein, who owns Malden Mills with several other members of his family, also spent nearly $25 million paying tide-me-over salaries to idled workers. That is the size of an emergency loan he is now seeking.
"It is kind of ironic," Mr. Feuerstein said.
Malden Mills has debts of $140 million, held by nine lenders, including GE Capital, the financing arm of General Electric. The lenders are asking Malden Mills to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy before they will provide an emergency loan to pay salaries and finance operations in coming months.
A Chapter 11 filing would not necessarily be the death knell for Malden Mills, which went through bankruptcy proceedings in the early 1980's. But it would nonetheless be a savage blow to Mr. Feuerstein, 75, who as president and chief executive, is hoping that support from state politicians and the local community will help him rescue the company.
In the light of Malden's current distress, some are asking whether Mr. Feuerstein's moves after the fire made good business sense.
The rebuilding included reconstruction of a furniture upholstery unit which accounted for half the company's $400 million in revenue in 1995, the year of the fire, and employed 1,500 people. But impatient upholstery customers bolted to other suppliers and never came back. The upholstery unit was later closed, cutting the company's revenue sharply and forcing layoffs anyway. Malden Mills now employs around 1,200 workers, and takes on several hundred more during its peak manufacturing season in the spring.
There were other missteps. As Mr. Feuerstein focused on bringing workers back into the new plant, he and his top managers neglected the threat of inexpensive fleece imported from Asia and elsewhere that generally sells for only about half as much as Malden's products. "We weren't creative and aggressive enough," Mr. Feuerstein said.
An ill-timed reshuffling of the marketing team in late 2000 came too late in the season to promote the company's new electric fabrics, in which heatable wires, powered by batteries, are embedded in fleece.
Some experts contend, however, Mr. Feuerstein's humanitarianism may ultimately prove far-sighted.
"There was a lot of business savvy to his decision" to rebuild and pay idled workers, said David Weil, a professor at Boston University's School of Management and an investigator at Harvard's Center for Textile and Apparel Research.
Professor Weil said that Mr. Feuerstein's employees were highly skilled producers of top-quality products and would not have been easy to replace had they been permanently laid off. He said that Malden Mills' problems -- a weak economy and stiff competition in the textile industry -- were unrelated to Mr. Feuerstein's deep-pocketed spending.
The company also faces a downturn in the British market, where foot-and-mouth disease has stalled purchases of fleece outerwear for hiking in rural areas. Malden Mills sells about a third of its fleece to British and European suppliers.
Financially, Malden Mills is suffering. Its revenue for fiscal 2001, ended Oct. 30, was about $180 million, flat compared with the previous year and far below the $400 million of 1995. More serious, its earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization -- a crucial measure of profitability -- plunged to nearly zero this year from $35 million in the previous fiscal year. Mr. Feuerstein declined to state net profits or losses. In 1995, the company earned about $30 million.
Much-loved Malden Mills has plenty of admirers. Local residents have organized a Web-based "Buy Fleece" campaign to support the company's customers, which include Patagonia, Lands' End, L. L. Bean and the United States military, whose Special Forces soldiers in Afghanistan wear fleece jackets.
Townspeople recently sent in checks, some as small as $10, as a token of support, said David Costello, a spokesman for Malden Mills. Senators Edward M. Kennedy and John Kerry, Democrats of Massachusetts, have lobbied G.E. in recent weeks not to force a Chapter 11 filing.
GE Capital holds about one-quarter of Malden Mills' total debt, including a chunk of $30 million in subordinate debt, Mr. Feuerstein said. In addition to GE Capital, the creditors include SAI Investment of Los Angeles; Firstar of Milwaukee; Finova Capital and Pilgrim Investments, both in Scottsdale, Ariz.; LaSalle Bank of Chicago; PNC Bank of Pittsburgh; and Van Kampen Investments of Oakbrook Terrace, Ill.
Peter S. Stack, a spokesman for GE Capital, declined to comment on Malden Mills.
Mr. Feuerstein, who speaks in dramatic tones, says he has no regrets about his past actions -- and no doubts about his factory's future. "There are times in business when you don't think of the financial consequences but of the human consequences," said Mr. Feuerstein, whose determination recently earned him the nickname "Old Aaronsides" in the local newspaper. "There is no doubt that this company will survive."
Malden Mills, he said, is moving into fast-growing markets for specialty products like electric fleece blankets and clothing for hunting and golfing. 
But survival under bankruptcy would undoubtedly mean that its finances, not its employees, come first. "When you are on the verge of bankruptcy, you have first duties to your creditors, and you lose a lot of freedom to act," said Ira Millstein, a professor at Yale University's School of Management.
Mr. Feuerstein may already have lost some leeway. On the advice of GE Capital, he recently installed an executive from Zolfo Cooper, a management consulting firm, as acting chief operating officer. The executive, Frank Budetti, declined to make himself available for comment, but he has been the principal negotiator for Malden Mills in its talks with its creditors, which began last month. The previous chief operating officer, Gerald Bowe, was sent to Gorlitz, Germany, to run a small Malden Mills factory there.
A test of whether Mr. Feuerstein's big heart will prove a financial boon is coming now, as 900 mill workers who are union members negotiate a new labor contract. The current three-year agreement is due to expire on Nov. 30, and Mr. Feuerstein said he had asked employees "to find ways to make materially significant contributions" to Malden.
Joseph Melo, who heads the mill's chapter of the Union of Needletrades, Industrial and Textile Employees, declined to comment on what sacrifices union members might make. But Ginette Gauvin, 48, who has worked at the mill for 24 years, said Mr. Feuerstein had asked employees not to bargain for a raise and to pay higher health insurance premiums.
"We're ready to make sacrifices for a little while," Ms. Gauvin said. "Whatever he asks us to do to keep the place going."

HEADLINE: Fed Official Backs Aggressive Rate Cuts 

BYLINE:  By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 27 

 BODY:
An influential member of the Federal Reserve said today that it should not shy away from continuing to ease monetary policy aggressively just because its benchmark interest rate is beginning to approach zero.
 Laurence H. Meyer, a Fed governor whose expertise in economic forecasting often helps shape the debate within the central bank, said the economy should "gradually strengthen" next year, and he did not say whether the Fed would cut rates for an 11th time this year at its next scheduled meeting on Dec. 11. 
 But Mr. Meyer said it would be a mistake to rule out further rate cuts in an effort to preserve the flexibility to reduce rates should the economy not recover or encounter an unexpected shock like another terrorist attack. Among other things, he said, the Fed had to keep in mind the possibility of deflation, or a general decline in prices, a development that would require rapid rate reductions. 
Speaking to the National Association of Business Economics in St. Louis, Mr. Meyer said the Fed's aggressive campaign of interest rate cuts this year had not rippled through the economy and the financial markets as much as traditional economic theory would have predicted. As a result, he said, the Fed had been forced to cut rates more deeply than past experience would have suggested was necessary.
Mr. Meyer also said the outlook for a quick recovery would be tempered somewhat if Congress and the Bush administration cannot agree on a fiscal stimulus package in coming weeks. The long-term forecast, he said, was being dimmed a bit by the likelihood that federal budget surpluses would be smaller than previously projected, a development likely to push up interest rates. 
The Fed has already cut its benchmark federal funds target rate 10 times this year, by a total of 4.5 percentage points, leaving it at a 40-year low of 2 percent. Some economists have expressed concern that further rate cuts in coming months could lead the Fed to shoot off the last of its ammunition before the recession has run its course, leaving the central bank largely powerless should the downturn prove to be longer or deeper than anticipated.
"Does this mean the Fed should 'keep its powder dry,' as some have argued, holding back on further easing in case the downturn turns out to be more serious or in case there are additional adverse shocks?" Mr. Meyer said. "I believe such a strategy would be misguided -- indeed the reverse of what would be appropriate."
The issue has been of concern to economists because of the experience of Japan, which has pushed official short-term rates almost to zero, and now has few monetary policy tools to battle its stubborn, decade-long economic downturn.
Mr. Meyer, who has said he will not seek reappointment to his Fed seat when his term expires in January, said the right strategy for the Fed would be to continue moving quickly to cut rates if the economy required it, "substituting speed of the move for the cumulative size of the easing."
As one of the Fed's most aggressive inflation fighters, Mr. Meyer has never been known for advocating rapid-fire rate cuts. But he said the central bank had to keep in mind the possibility that inflation might drift lower, or even turn to deflation, making it harder for the Fed to push the "real" federal funds rate -- the nominal rate minus the inflation rate -- into negative territory. The Fed typically seeks a negative real fed funds rate in trying to nurse the economy out of recession.
"In the worst case, as in Japan today, inflation might turn to deflation, limiting the ability to lower the real policy rate even to zero," he said.

HEADLINE: Confidence Index Drops, but Housing Sales Rise 

BYLINE:  Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 27 

 BODY:
Consumer confidence unexpectedly slumped this month, but housing was a surprise bright spot in the economy in October, reports showed today.
 The Conference Board reported that its index of consumer confidence fell to 82.2 this month from 85.3 in October as Americans' assessment of current conditions declined. It was the lowest level in seven and a half years. 
 In housing, sales of existing homes surged a larger-than-expected 5.5 percent in October, to an annual pace of 5.17 million units from a 4.9 million rate in September, the National Association of Realtors said.
Brian Bruce, who manages $4 billion as director of global investments at PanAgora Asset Management in Boston, struck a somewhat optimistic note, noting that home and auto sales are up. "Consumers are most glum before the economy turns around," he said. "Things aren't as bad as the consumer confidence index suggests."
Moreover, consumer expectations for the next six months rose, the Conference Board reported. Retailers like Kmart said sales improved last week. And the 30-year mortgage rate is close to a record low. That is setting the stage for a gradual rebound from the first recession in a decade.
Federal Reserve policy makers "expect the recovery to improve next year, although the timing is uncertain," Michael Moskow, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, said today. "Confidence will be an important factor."
Measures of sentiment have been mixed. The Conference Board's index of current conditions fell to 93.5, in November from 107.2. The index measuring consumers' six-month outlook rose to 74.6, from 70.7.
Most economists were surprised in the decline in the overall index. They had expected an increase to 86.5.
Home sales have been supported by falling mortgage rates. The average rate on a 30-year fixed mortgage has stayed below 7 percent for three months, the longest stretch on record below that level.
The 30-year rate fell to a record 6.45 percent this month, according to Freddie Mac, which buys mortgages. The average principal and interest payment on a $100,000 mortgage at that rate would be $628.78 a month. That compared with an average $778.86 in May 2000. 
The National Association of Realtors said it expected 5.19 million existing homes would be sold this year, second only to 1999, when 5.21 million homes were sold.

HEADLINE: Census Said to Misplace Many Prisons and Dorms 

BYLINE:  By JANNY SCOTT 

 BODY:
There are two basic mistakes you can make in a census: You can miscount people, and you can put them in the wrong place.
 The Census Bureau appears to have done the counting part pretty well in 2000. But the putting-them-in-the-right-place part, some demographers say, is something else again. 
 Across the country, demographers and planners say the Census Bureau appears to have misplaced entire populations of dozens of prisons and college dormitories. They say the bureau inexplicably removed those populations from census tracts or blocks where the facilities had sat for decades, and deposited them somewhere else. 
In New York State, for example, 2,192 inmates at Green Haven Correctional Facility, a maximum-security prison in the town of Beekman, landed mysteriously in Milan, a smaller town some 27 miles to the north, said Warren A. Brown, a professor of sociology at Cornell University.
In California, the inmates of Pelican Bay State Prison in Crescent City turned up outside the city limits, the city manager said. The city discovered the problem, he said, when a quarterly payment it receives from the state plummeted because the 2000 census showed the city's population had shrunk.
In Minnesota, the inhabitants of the Federal Correctional Institution in Sandstone turned up down the road "in a tract that should have almost no one in it," said Tom Gillaspy, the state demographer. And the tract that houses a state prison in St. Cloud was listed as having no population at all, he said.
"I think this is the tip of the iceberg," said Robert Scardamalia, chief demographer for the New York Department of Economic Development. "I think if they did a nationwide analysis, they'd find an unacceptably high number of errors. That's my speculation."
"The supreme irony," said Professor Brown, "is the census did a really good job on the hard-to-count population this time around. And they fumbled the ball on the easy-to-count. What could be easier than counting somebody in a prison?"
Census Bureau officials say any problems are few and relatively insignificant. They note that the bureau did not miss the people; it simply placed some on the wrong side of the street, for example. One official, Preston Jay Waite, said the number of these complaints from communities -- 85 so far -- was no surprise.
"All I'm saying is I'm not shocked at the level of appeals," Mr. Waite, the bureau's associate director for the decennial census, said of the official challenges filed with the bureau concerning prison and other institutional populations. "If anything, I'm surprised that it's not higher than it is. But it's still early."
The population in question is the so-called group-quarters population, the 7.778 million people who were living in prisons, dormitories and similar facilities at the time the census was taken. The bureau counts people in group quarters separately from the rest of the population.
When in March the bureau began releasing data from the 2000 census, planners started noticing unexpected shifts in the population counts in a number of places. When they looked to see what might explain surprise increases or drops, some began to suspect problems in the allocation of group quarters.
Lindsay Carille, a junior planner for the Department of Planning and Development in Dutchess County, N.Y., said the official count for one census block in the town of Milan had leaped implausibly to more than 2,000, from zero in 1990. She and others say they believe the Green Haven prison population ended up there.
In Ithaca, N.Y., where Cornell University and Ithaca College have dormitories, the population count for one census block jumped to 5,882, from only 110 in 1990, said Thomas Mank of the Tompkins County Planning Department. The count for another block, he said, dropped to 2 from 1,100.
In Crescent City, Calif., David Wells, the city manager, said the city's quarterly allocation of state revenue shrunk after the 2000 census. With the Pelican Bay prison population misplaced, he said, the city's official population count was down. So the city was supposedly entitled to less state money. It took special state legislation to restore the full sum, he said.
"A number of federal and state formulas are based on total population," said Mr. Gillaspy, the Minnesota demographer. "So when you have 500 or 1,000 people who are misallocated, it's a fairly substantial issue. For the nation as a whole, it might not be that big of a deal. But for that community, it's a huge issue."
It is unclear how many such problems exist. Since July 1, when it began accepting challenges under its new "count question resolution" program, the Census Bureau has received 161 challenges, Mr. Waite said. Eighty-five involve group quarters, and nearly all have yet to be processed.
In New York, Mr. Scardamalia, the state demographer there, said there were so many questions about the counts that he and others had begun looking more closely. Randomly examining areas with colleges and prisons, he said, they quickly found several dozen anomalies, including "what appeared to be some pretty gross errors."
Concerned, he asked the bureau to delay the release of other census data scheduled to be made public, a suggestion the bureau did not follow. He said the bureau should plan to correct and reissue not just the population counts but related data on race, age and the like. 
Mr. Waite, the Census Bureau official, said the bureau would investigate every challenge. If a population was misplaced, the agency will correct the counts and notify the communities in writing, he said. Those letters, he said, can be shown to other government agencies as proof of the corrected counts.
But he said the bureau did not have the resources to change all the other census data attached to those population numbers -- the data on age, race, household composition, income and so on. "The only thing we will send back is that 47 people were added," he said. "We will not show them detailed characteristics about those people."
As for how mistakes might have occurred, he said agencies might have given the bureau incorrect addresses -- the address of an administrative office, say, rather than that of a particular institution. Or census workers may have failed to go out and verify the address, or may have made clerical errors.
"The unfortunate aspect of it is that it does raise a lot of quality issues," Mr. Gillaspy said. "Rightly or wrongly, it's not a confidence builder. It sort of lowers your confidence in the whole thing. And that's sad. Because a great deal of effort went into the rest of the census."

HEADLINE: A NATION CHALLENGED: THE RECOVERY PACKAGE; 
$38 Billion Tax Hiatus Proposed

BYLINE:  By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 27 

 BODY:
Republicans in the Senate said today that they would support a new idea for giving the economy an immediate boost -- freeing employers and employees from paying Social Security payroll taxes for one month -- in an effort to break a partisan impasse over the proposed economic stimulus package.
 The plan would amount to a tax cut, split evenly between workers and employers, worth $38 billion if it were enacted in December, or about $43 billion if put in place early next year. For a worker earning $40,000 a year, the payroll tax holiday would mean an extra $207. The worker's employer would save the same amount. 
 Republicans put the plan forward as part of a revised package of tax cuts to help the economy recover from the first recession in a decade. The new package would cut taxes by about $100 billion in 2002.
It includes an immediate reduction in the current 27 percent personal income tax rate to 25 percent, a reduction that under current law would not happen until 2006. It would also provide tax breaks for business, a 13-week extension of unemployment benefits beyond the current 26-week limit and $5 billion that states could use for assistance programs, like helping laid-off workers get health insurance.
Democrats said they were open to the payroll tax holiday, which was first proposed by Senator Pete V. Domenici, Republican of New Mexico. But they insisted they would not negotiate a deal until Republicans agreed to consider additional spending for domestic security needs, like bioterrorism readiness, in conjunction with the proposed tax cuts.
"That's something that we would certainly be willing to consider, but again, not at the expense of giving up all of our commitment to homeland security," said Senator Tom Daschle of South Dakota, the Democratic majority leader.
The two parties have been deadlocked over the economic recovery bill for weeks. Mr. Daschle and other Congressional leaders are expected to discuss the issue with President Bush over breakfast at the White House on Wednesday morning. 
But neither side has shown much inclination to budge from its basic principles. For Republicans, that means a bill primarily composed of tax cuts. For Democrats, it means that most of the help go to laid-off workers and low-income people and that the package be considered alongside their plan for additional spending on security.
In the package put forward by Senate Republicans today, the payroll tax holiday would replace an idea that both parties had agreed on, sending $300-per-person checks to low-income workers who had not qualified for the rebate checks sent out this summer under the tax cut Mr. Bush signed into law in June.

HEADLINE: BASEBALL; 
Lead Bidder for Red Sox Has The Times as Investor

BYLINE:  By MURRAY CHASS

DATELINE: CHICAGO, Nov. 27 

 BODY:
One of the most intriguing sales of a team in baseball history is scheduled to reach its climax Thursday when prospective buyers submit their final bids for a majority interest in the Boston Red Sox.
 Not even the Red Sox can be sure how many bids they will receive, but half a dozen or so potential buyers have either identified themselves or been identified by others. A potential sale price of $350 million to $400 million has been widely talked about. If the price reaches that level, it will be the highest paid for a baseball team. Larry Dolan bought the Cleveland Indians for $323 million in February 2000. 
 The leading contender for the 53 percent that is owned by the Jean R. Yawkey Trust is a group that is headed by Tom Werner, former managing owner of the San Diego Padres, and includes, as a minority investor, The New York Times Company, owner of The Boston Globe as well as The Times.
Although the outcome could depend on the bids, especially if one bid is significantly higher than the others, the Werner group is considered the leading contender because of the people who are in it, many of whom are held in high regard by Commissioner Bud Selig and other baseball officials and owners.
First is Werner himself. He was close to Selig when he operated the Padres. Werner is joined by, among others, George Mitchell, the former United States senator from Maine, who was a member of the blue ribbon panel that Selig named to study the game's economics, and Larry Lucchino, former president of the Padres (not under Werner) and the Baltimore Orioles.
Lucchino, who left the Padres earlier this year, has been working with Selig on various economic matters and has developed a close working relationship with him. If the group is the successful bidder, Lucchino will be the Red Sox president.
According to a person close to the group, it also hopes to add John Henry, owner of the Florida Marlins. Henry has been negotiating to sell the Marlins to Jeffrey Loria, who owns the Montreal Expos, one of the two teams expected to be eliminated under baseball's contraction plan, whenever that happens.
Some reports have said that Henry has completed a deal with Loria, but Selig said today, "Mr. Henry does not have a buyer for his team." Henry would not be permitted to join a group bidding for the Red Sox as long as he owns the Marlins, although he did not sell his 1 percent share of the Yankees before buying the Marlins.
Others that may submit final bids are a Boston group that includes Joe O'Donnell, a Boston concessionaire, and Steve Karp, a mall developer; Charles Dolan of Cablevision, whose brother owns the Cleveland Indians; Frank McCourt, a South Boston waterfront land owner; Miles Prentice, a New York lawyer, who made an unsuccessful bid to buy the Kansas City Royals; and two concessions companies, Delaware North and the Aramark Corporation.
The Times Company's share in the Werner group is subject to final negotiations and acceptance of the group's bid, said Janet L. Robinson, the company's senior vice president for newspaper operations. "Neither The Globe nor The New York Times Company will be involved in operating the ball club," she said today.
Asked if even minority ownership of the Red Sox would represent a conflict of interest, Robinson said: "This minority investment would present a conflict of interest only if Globe or Times reporters and editors were required or encouraged to give the team favored treatment. This will not be the case."
The Times would not be the first newspaper company to be an owner of a baseball team. For example, The Tribune Company owns the Chicago Cubs. 
Robinson said the investment in the Red Sox was also attractive to the Times Company because it includes the New England sports cable network, which the Red Sox own. 
"This investment bid is being made as part of The Boston Globe's long-term strategic plan to solidify its position as the leading news and advertising media in New England," she said. "This investment in the Red Sox franchise, and specifically the New England Sports Network, would allow us to bring Boston Globe journalism from print to television by creating and producing Globe-branded sports programming. 
"The New England Sports Network would enable The Globe to extend its nationally recognized sports reporting franchise to the television medium, as well as allow it to better serve advertisers with combined print, television and Internet advertising sales."
The Times Company, Robinson added, also likes the plan the Werner group has for preserving Fenway Park as the Red Sox' home. The team, she noted, was once owned by Gen. Charles Taylor, whose son built Fenway Park in 1912. The Taylor family also once owned The Globe.

Fordham's Hill Says He Is Feeling Well

BYLINE:  By RAFAEL HERMOSO

 BODY:
When Coach BOB HILL missed Fordham's first game, the university announced that he was having minor surgery. He has not missed either of the Rams' games since, but Hill announced yesterday that the surgery was anything but small.
 On Nov. 12, the night Fordham opened at DePaul, Hill had a melanoma removed from his back, a mole that doctors discovered was malignant. Hill pronounced himself cancer-free yesterday, saying he was not receiving any further treatment and that the only complication arose when the incision opened after stitches were removed. 
 "It was scary for a few days," Hill said. "It's under control. Everything is clear. It's slowed me a little bit, not a lot."
 Fordham (1-2) plays at Iona tonight and against St. John's on Saturday at Madison Square Garden in the second game of the inaugural Marty Glickman Classic. The doubleheader begins with Hofstra against Iona at noon.

FIGHT FOR THE GARDEN
 One of Bob Hill's goals has been to make Fordham a regular at the Garden. To that end, Fordham plays four games there this season, including Saturday's game against St. John's. Hill wanted to play three Atlantic-10 games at the Garden.
 "There's a problem with it right now," Hill said of the Garden. "They said St. John's doesn't want us to be part of doubleheaders. I don't really know."
 JOEL FISHER, the Garden's senior vice president for sports properties, said difficulties in scheduling, not St. John's resistance, prevented Fordham from playing more games at the Garden. Fisher notes that Fordham plays in next month's Holiday Festival with Manhattan, Iona and Seton Hall but not with St. John's.
 "It doesn't only have to be with St. John's," Fisher said, before adding, "There's no question St. John's is our main college basketball talent and we want to do everything possible to keep them happy."
 St. John's Athletic Director DAVE WEGRZYN said he had not asked not to be matched with Fordham, and that Big East rules affect when St. John's plays.

ST. JOHN'S
 St. John's returned from a long, dark and cold trip to Alaska with a 2-1 record in the Great Alaska Shootout in Anchorage and a new point guard. Coach MIKE JARVIS's experiment with the junior-college transfer MARCUS HATTEN at point guard appears over, for now. Jarvis started the freshman TRISTAN SMITH at the point in the team's third game in Alaska, against Tennessee, moving Hatten back to his natural shooting-guard position.
 The result was impressive. Smith had 9 points and 3 assists, and Hatten had 21 points, 7 assists and 8 steals as St. John's defeated the Volunteers, 69-55. The Red Storm (3-1) led by as many as 21 points in the first half. St. John's had lost to Gonzaga and then beaten Oregon State in the tournament.

SETON HALL
 Seton Hall (2-2) returned from Hawaii after producing one of the most talked-about performances of the early season. The Pirates led No. 1 Duke for much of their game last week before losing, 80-79, in the Maui Classic. Seton Hall followed that with a victory over Chaminade and a loss to Kansas, which had been upset by Ball State and was ranked No. 4. Some were not surprised by the Pirates' performance.
 "I thought they completely outplayed Duke, and Duke got lucky," Syracuse Coach JIM BOEHEIM said. Of Seton Hall's low expectations after losing forward EDDIE GRIFFIN, center SAMUEL DALEMBERT and Coach TOMMY AMAKER, Boeheim said, "I knew that was a mistake where they were picked because they have the best guard play in the league, by far." The Pirates are led in the backcourt by the sophomore ANDRE BARRETT, the junior DESMOND HEROD and the seniors TY SHINE and DARIUS LANE.

PRESEASON N.I.T.
 The Preseason National Invitation Tournament may have produced a final between Syracuse and Wake Forest worthy of the postseason, but it had few spectators. The event last week at the Garden drew announced crowds of 6,837 for the semifinals Wednesday night and 7,891 for the championship and consolation game on Friday.
 Three of the four teams were ranked in the top 25 (Syracuse, Michigan State and Fresno State), but the field lacked a name player, with Syracuse's PRESTON SHUMPERT the closest thing to one.
 That was not the problem, said Joel Fisher the Garden's senior vice president for sports properties. Fisher cited the ailing economy and the Sept. 11 attacks for keeping tourists out of New York and said Syracuse did not bring as many fans as it normally does. Fisher said scheduling the games around Thanksgiving was not the problem, since the Garden has historically done so and drawn well. RAFAEL HERMOSO

HEADLINE: For the Big Canadian Banks, Profit Is Retail and Domestic 

BYLINE:  By BERNARD SIMON 

DATELINE: TORONTO, Nov. 27 

 BODY:
After a decade of spreading their wings into investment banking and across the border into the United States, Canada's big five banks are growing to appreciate their own backyard.
 A common thread through the recent earnings reports from Royal Bank of Canada, Toronto-Dominion Bank, Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce and Bank of Montreal is the relatively robust performance of their retail and small-business operations in Canada, where they dominate the financial services industry. The fifth big bank, Bank of Nova Scotia, reports next week. 
 James Keating, an analyst with Merrill Lynch Canada, said that "a combination of falling interest rates and pretty good pricing discipline" had helped the banks' retail operations. He said that the slide in interest rates had enabled the banks to borrow more cheaply and offer competitive loan rates.
Today, the Bank of Canada cut its bellwether overnight rate by half a percentage point, to 2.25 percent, the ninth reduction this year. 
Over all, the banks' earnings for the fiscal year that ended on Oct. 31 have contained few surprises. The returns on equity of all four that have reported so far have fallen over the last year.
Royal's return for fiscal 2001 was 17.1 percent, down from 20.2 percent in 2000. Canadian Imperial fell to 19.8 percent from 22.5 percent, and Bank of Montreal to 14.8 percent from 18.8 percent. Toronto-Dominion's return was unchanged at 18 percent for the year, but slipped to 16.8 percent in the fourth quarter. All figures exclude unusual items.
In most cases, the declines are a result of restructuring costs and significantly higher provisions for loan losses, especially in investment banking. Even before the release of the fourth-quarter earnings, four of the five banks had announced increases in these provisions.
In the case of Bank of Montreal, 60 percent of the 430 million Canadian dollars ($269 million) in extra provisions stemmed from business in the United States, and almost three-quarters was from investment banking activities. Several of the Canadian banks have a sizable exposure to the beleaguered North American telecommunications industry.
The retail business presents a brighter picture. Peter Godsoe, chairman of the Bank of Nova Scotia, said in a recent presentation that revenue growth in Canada had held up "reasonably well" since Sept 11. "It may be unexciting, but it's highly effective and, I might add, highly profitable," Mr. Godsoe said.
Royal Bank, the biggest of the five, said net income from personal and commercial banking grew 8 percent in the final quarter, compared with a year earlier. By contrast, Royal lost $8.75 million on investment and corporate banking in the quarter, in contrast to earnings of $70 million in August-October 2000.
Jacek Dzierwa, an analyst with Salomon Smith Barney in Toronto, said that in spite of lackluster profitability, Canadian banking was "quite healthy" with one of the strongest capital bases of banks anywhere in the world.

HEADLINE: Vehicle Sales Stayed Robust In November 

BYLINE:  By DANNY HAKIM 

DATELINE: DETROIT, Nov. 27 

 BODY:
Auto sales have remained surprisingly strong this month easing the recession, economists say, and possibly shortening it, with automakers beginning to announce plans to increase production more than initially expected early next year to rebuild inventories. 
 November's robust sales, after October's record pace, have been driven by a wave of interest-free financing offers from the Big Three, which have been good news for car buyers with good credit and have attracted many others to dealerships. And the incentives, by increasing consumer spending, have brought hopeful tidings to a bleak economy. 
 On Monday, the National Bureau of Economic Research said the country was indeed in a recession -- and had been since March. But many economists say the auto price war, regardless of its implications in Detroit, will help the broader economy. 
"It's going to be one of the key factors getting us out of the recession," said Diane C. Swonk, chief economist at Bank One in Chicago, noting that the auto industry accounts for 3 to 5 percent of the gross domestic product. "There's no single industry that's a bigger swing factor, quarter to quarter." 
What is good for the economy, though, is not necessarily good for the Big Three. Incentives have increased automakers' losses and drawn criticism from analysts, investors and even from top executives at Ford and Chrysler, which have followed the lead of General Motors in using interest-free financing. And much of the cost will be dumped onto auto suppliers, whose profit margins are narrowing. 
G.M. spurred the zero percent deals when sales stagnated after the terror attacks, but the company also saw a chance to gain market share after years of declines, because it had one of the newest crops of pickups and S.U.V.'s on the market. G.M. has started to ratchet down the incentives by excluding some vehicles and offering interest-free financing only on three-year deals. 
Ford officials said in their third fiscal-quarter report that incentive costs had risen from 11 percent of revenue last year to 16 percent this year. Each percentage point increase costs $1 billion in pretax profits, a chief reason Ford is expected to have its first year of net losses since 1992. 
"The industry did need a jump-start post Sept. 11, so that was good," said Martin Inglis, chief financial officer of Ford Motor, in an interview on Monday. "My only question is, Was this the way to jump-start it?" 
"Whereas October was ridiculous, now it's only horrific," he added, referring to the incentive costs.
Rick Wagoner, G.M.'s chief executive, said in an interview this month that his company was weighing both the broad economic implications and its own self-preservation in leading makers into interest-free deals. 
"We thought it was good for us, but we thought it was good for the economy," he said. "We saw that we could get people to come in and buy when it seemed like there was no way to cross that bridge, so that's why we really feel strongly that the right kind of stimulus package would add a lot of value to the whole economy." 
A positive for the economic outlook next year is that the financing deals have greatly reduced inventories on car lots, meaning that production may increase in the first quarter. Officials at Ford, which cut production after the attacks, said this week that they had recently increased their projections for first-quarter production because inventories of cars and trucks were at their lowest level since March of 1992. 
"Having cut back sharply, now they have to start rebuilding those inventories," said David A. Wyss, chief economist of Standard & Poor's DRI. "It helps us come out of the recession sooner, and it shows that the consumer is not as scared to spend as some had thought." 
Analysts project that November's annual sales rate, seasonally adjusted, will be 17.5 million to 18.5 million vehicles, compared with 16.4 million in November 2000. The official results will be reported by the industry on Monday. November's strong sales follow a 21.3 million rate in October, the biggest sales month in the industry's history. 
At the same time, analysts have been pessimistic about next year. Scott Sprinzen, managing director for corporate and government bond ratings for Standard & Poor's, said today that the big sales in October and November are "a direct trade-off" that will steal sales from 2002. 
"We are even more cautious about next year" as a result, he said. Standard & Poor's has downgraded the credit of G.M., Ford and DaimlerChrysler recently, as have other ratings agencies. Equities analysts have also been critical of the fiscal wisdom of incentives. But the overall wisdom of Detroit's strategy depends on whom one asks. Analysts see the bottom line. Economists see the economy.
"They have been highly criticized because they are losing money, but I think that's shortsighted," said Richard J. DeKaser, chief economist of National City Bank in Cleveland. 
"Had they not cleared out the inventory, they would have had to clear 2001 inventory in 2002, and you can't do that at full price," he said, adding that the interest-free financing plans were a "short-term positive" for the economy and "in the long term, close to neutral."

Microsoft Move May Hasten Settlement of European Case

BYLINE:  By STEVE LOHR with PAUL MELLER 

 BODY:
Offering a strong signal that it wants to settle its antitrust case in Europe, Microsoft has told the European Commission that it will forgo its right to a hearing next month, company officials and European regulators said yesterday.
 The move is procedural, but it could hasten the path toward settlement in Europe by allowing talks to begin earlier and avoid a possibly confrontational hearing. 
 "We asked the commission to withdraw our request for a hearing," said John Frank, a legal counsel for Microsoft in Paris.
The Microsoft gesture follows two major settlement deals in the last month that went a long way to resolving the company's longstanding antitrust problems. The company agreed to a settlement with the Justice Department and 9 of the 18 states that had sued Microsoft in federal court, and it agreed to settle more than 100 private class-action antitrust suits. 
Though the Microsoft decision helps open the door to an agreement in Europe, there is no assurance that a deal will be reached. "This doesn't mean a settlement is automatically the next juncture," noted a government official close to the commission investigation.
The European case has a different emphasis from the antitrust suit brought in the United States, though they overlap. In a "statement of objections" presented to Microsoft in August, the commission said that the company had abused its monopoly power by withholding technical information that rivals needed to allow their software to run smoothly with Microsoft's industry-standard Windows operating system.
The issue of "interoperability," in industry parlance, is particularly important in the market for software used on big data-serving computers, which are connected to desktop machines running Windows. In the market for server software, Microsoft competes against Sun Microsystems and others.
The European Commission's statement of objections, issued in August, also contended that Microsoft had illegally bundled its media-playing software with Windows to undermine competition in the fast-growing new market for online music and video software.
A European statement of objections is not a final decision in a case. But it is a kind of final warning for a defendant company, strongly indicating where the commission is headed.
In the United States, the federal suit focused on an array of anticompetitive acts by Microsoft to protect its Windows monopoly and the practice of bundling its Internet browsing software with its operating system. Yet the proposed settlement with the Justice Department and nine states does include a provision requiring Microsoft to disclose more technical information to software rivals. And the nine states that did not join the settlement say they think that is one provision that needs to be stronger.
"The interoperability issues are significant, and it is an area that needs to be improved," said Richard Blumenthal, the Connecticut attorney general.
Mr. Blumenthal, like other state attorneys general who did not join the settlement earlier this month, had still been reviewing the agreement. But he decided definitively yesterday to fight for stronger sanctions. "We've made our review, and we've decided to pursue this in court," he said.
The dissenting states will propose their own set of remedies to the court on Dec. 7.
Those states, in theory, could get some help from Europe. Microsoft's software offerings are global products. As a practical matter, any concession made to suit European regulators will be made worldwide, company officials acknowledge.
Indeed, the previous antitrust settlement Microsoft agreed to in 1994 -- a "consent decree" in the United States, and an "undertaking" in Europe -- was negotiated simultaneously in Washington and Brussels. But in the current round, the timing is not as coordinated and the antitrust climate may be different in Europe and America.
As an example, antitrust experts point to the European resistance earlier this year that derailed the merger of General Electric and Honeywell, even though Washington had approved. "We're not operating in as close harmony with Europe as we have at times in the past," said Herbert Hovenkamp, a law professor at the University of Iowa.
Still, the Microsoft decision in the European case to withdraw its request for a two-day hearing, which would have begun on Dec. 20, is another clear example that the company is moving aggressively to try to put its antitrust troubles behind it. The recent settlement-mindedness is in marked contrast to the rigid posture of denial and litigation that Microsoft held for years.
In an interview last week, Brad Smith, who was tapped to become Microsoft's new general counsel, said he was hopeful that a settlement could be reached in Europe. "The commission is concerned about interoperability issues, and we're committed to interoperability," Mr. Smith said.
Whether the details of Microsoft's commitment will satisfy the commission remains to be seen. The company filed its reply to the commission's statement of objections on Nov. 16. The commission staff is now studying the Microsoft document, which runs to 100 pages and is supplemented by reports from economic and technical experts hired by Microsoft. It also includes the testimony of 46 Microsoft customers, saying that in their experience Windows works fine with the server software of other companies.
In keeping with commission practice, the Microsoft filing, which is not released to the public, is nonetheless released to "third parties" to the investigation -- mainly rivals like Sun Microsystems that brought complaints against Microsoft.
In Europe, the third parties can also ask for a hearing. It is rare for a defendant to forgo its right to a hearing, said Amelia Torres, a commission spokeswoman on competition matters. But Ms. Torres added, "The right to a hearing applies both to defendants and complainants."
A spokeswoman for Sun Microsystems had no comment on Microsoft's move or whether it would seek a hearing.

HEADLINE: World Business Briefing Europe: The Netherlands: Grocer's Profit Is Up 

BYLINE:  By Suzanne Kapner (NYT) 

 BODY:
 Royal Ahold, the large Dutch supermarket operator and food distributor, reported a 17 percent increase in third-quarter profit. Third-quarter net income climbed to 304.2 million euros ($268.5 million), or 34 cents a share, from 259.6 million euros, or 33 cents a share, a year earlier. With the United States economy in a recession and people tending to eat more at home, sales at Ahold's Giant and Stop & Shop chains along the Eastern Seaboard are benefiting, analysts said.

HEADLINE: Landmarks Group Approves Bold Plan for Hearst Tower 

BYLINE:  By DAVID W. DUNLAP 

 BODY:
The Landmarks Preservation Commission gave its blessing yesterday to a remarkable architectural union that would permit the Hearst Corporation to complete the mid-Manhattan headquarters it began building 74 years ago. 
 Under the plan approved by the commission, Hearst would construct 36 floors atop its landmark six-story headquarters at 959 Eighth Avenue, between 56th and 57th Streets. The architect, Norman Foster of Foster & Partners in London, is renowned for his daring additions to the Reichstag in Berlin and the British Museum in London. 
 At first glance, the Hearst tower differs strikingly from the landmark through which it would rise to a height of 597 feet. The original is a sturdy cast-stone mesa entered by a grand archway, adorned by allegorical statues and pierced by fluted columns with urns on top. Its high-rise companion would be a faceted, dimple-edged, stainless-steel grid of cascading, colossal diamonds. 
But Sherida E. Paulsen, chairwoman of the landmarks commission, discerned a strong spiritual relation between the addition and the exuberant original, by Joseph Urban, whose early fame was as a set designer for the impresario Florenz Ziegfeld. 
"It really does complete the building," Ms. Paulsen said. "The very theatrical aspects of Urban's design are realized."
She was joined in supporting the plan by every member of the commission but Deborah S. Gardner, who abstained out of concern that the landmark would come to be seen as merely a screenlike facade around the base of the new tower. She also said the commission had not heard enough about how Hearst planned to restore the original architectural details, which is part of the project.
Hearst also needs approval from the City Planning Commission to take advantage of a zoning bonus that would permit a building of 720,000 square feet, 20 percent larger than would usually be allowed. In exchange, it would make improvements to the adjoining Columbus Circle subway station.
The base of the building would be turned into an atrium up to 70 feet high, with views through skylights to the tower above, though the question of how much of this would be open to the public has yet to be resolved.
Even with city approvals in hand, Hearst will consider the state of the economy before making a final decision to go forward with the tower, in which it would consolidate operations that are now scattered around Columbus Circle. In no event does it expect to begin building until 2003.
Nonetheless, the Rev. Dr. Thomas F. Pike, a member of the commission, said the timing of the proposal so soon after the attack on New York would send a hopeful sign that "the creative process goes on" in the city.
His enthusiasm was shared by the Municipal Art Society, the New York Landmarks Conservancy, the New York chapter of the American Institute of Architects and Community Board 4 in mid-Manhattan.
The Hearst Corporation and Lord Foster had so carefully cultivated support for the project that the entire formal review lasted only 2 hours and 40 minutes, from the opening statement by Frank A. Bennack Jr., president and chief executive of Hearst, through Lord Foster's presentation, public testimony, questions and answers, commissioners' remarks and the vote.
As such, this project represents the most striking evidence yet of a change in New York's aesthetic landscape, in which contextualism has long been the watchword when it comes to historic buildings and districts.
"Here comes somebody who's doing something that -- thank heavens -- doesn't look like everything else," said Frederic S. Papert, president of the 42nd Street Development Corporation and a board member of the New York Landmarks Conservancy, in an interview before the meeting. "Isn't that what we want?"
Not exactly, some preservationists answered.
" 'Isn't it a neat building?' is not the question," said Simeon Bankoff, executive director of the Historic Districts Council, which did not support the plan. "The question is whether it's appropriate. We feel it's not an appropriate building. It does not respond to, respect or even speak to its landmark base."
Supporters made it plain that their endorsement rested in part on the premise that the Hearst Building was envisioned from the first as the base of a larger structure. But no record exists of Urban's intentions for the tower.
That gave Lord Foster freer reign to devise his own composition. Working with the New York engineer Ysrael A. Seinuk, he devised a structural system of nine tiers of interlocking four-story triangles that resolve into larger diamond patterns; even stylized H's, looked at a certain way.

HEADLINE: A Saudi Prince With an Unconventional Idea: Elections 

BYLINE:  By DOUGLAS JEHL

DATELINE: RIYADH, Saudi Arabia, Nov. 27 

 BODY:
A prominent member of Saudi Arabia's royal family called today for a transformation that would bring elections, "the faster the better," to a kingdom whose only bow to democracy has been the establishment of an appointed advisory council.
 Prince Walid bin Talal, a billionaire investor, said in an interview here that he was addressing the politically taboo subject to augment what he called intensive discussions within the royal family about what Saudi Arabia could be doing better to address domestic discontent -- particularly in the wake of the Sept. 11 attacks, in which 15 of 19 hijackers were Saudis. 
 "If people speak more freely and get involved more in the political process, you can really contain them and make them part of the process," Prince Walid said.
The remarks were unusually candid in a kingdom that almost always maintains a guarded public face, particularly on questions of internal decisions and any kind of political liberalization. 
They echoed loud but private calls by Saudi liberals, who have begun to speculate that the widespread Saudi participation in the Sept. 11 attacks was at least in part a consequence of a closed political system that allows little room for political expression.
For most of his career, Prince Walid, 47, has shunned a political role, focusing on a career in investing that has made him one of the world's richest businessmen. But he waded into political controversy last month, when he offered $10 million to the City of New York for victims of the World Trade Center disaster but also issued a press release saying American policy in the Middle East had helped to fan extremism.
The suggestion that United States policy might have been partly to blame for the attack inflamed anger among some Americans, including Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, who rejected Prince Walid's gift.
In the interview, Prince Walid defended Saudi Arabia's monarchy as popular and resilient, and said he had quietly favored an eventual shift toward some democracy long before Sept. 11. But he also made clear his view that terrorism and its roots remained a subject of deep concern within the ruling Saud family.
"What I'm saying could be too much for Saudi Arabia," he said, "but I'm speaking my mind."
As laid down by King Fahd and his predecessors, the official Saudi line has long shunned democracy as an unwelcome imposition. It was not until 1992 that King Fahd even formed the consultative council, whose members are appointed in a mechanism that its chairman, Sheik Muhammad al-Jubeir, defended in an interview this week as far superior to popular elections.
In calling for change, Prince Walid made clear that what he had in mind was limited. He said the 120-member council should be chosen in elections that would be open, at least at first, to men only. The approach would be roughly similar to the one in place in Kuwait, which has had an elected Parliament since 1961.
Two of Saudi Arabia's other neighbors, Bahrain and Qatar, have also promised to hold elections by the end of next year. It is a sign of growing democratic experimentation in the Persian Gulf region, in which almost all power still lies in the hands of kings, emirs, sheiks and sultans.
But Prince Walid's remarks were extraordinarily bold by the standards of Saudi Arabia, where criticism of the royal family is prohibited -- and where some officials have continued to dismiss as unproven the idea of Saudi involvement in the Sept. 11 attacks, for which the United States holds the Saudi dissident Osama bin Laden responsible.
"We should not take this matter for granted, the loyalty of our people," Prince Walid said. "People are very loyal as Saudis, very loyal. For sure they don't want bin Laden and the Taliban types to rule here, because they see how backward they are in Afghanistan.
"But we should really let them talk more freely. We should not be worried about that at all."
Advocates of greater political openness have argued that it would force Saudi Arabia to deal more quickly with internal problems, including a high rate of unemployment, while allowing moderates to drown out extremist voices like those of Mr. bin Laden, which they say thrive in a closed society.
Prince Walid has defended the remarks in his news release accompanying the offer of a donation to New York, which accused the United States of a lack of evenhandedness in the Middle East peace efforts. Spurned by Mr. Giuliani, he said he had divided the $10 million into donations in equal parts to Afghan refugees and "the Palestinian cause."
At the same time, he said his calls for changes in Saudi Arabia were a second step in trying to call attention to what both countries might do better.
A nephew of King Fahd, and also of Crown Prince Abdullah, the country's day-to-day ruler, Prince Walid is one of scores of grandsons of Saudi Arabia's founder, King Abdel Aziz. His own father, Prince Talal, who is widely regarded as one of the family's more liberal members, has long been sidelined from any role in government, but he has said that Prince Walid ought not to be excluded from the line of royal succession.
In the interview today, Prince Walid sounded another populist note by saying he favored an end to the system of royal allowances that provide even the youngest newborn prince with thousands of dollars a month. He said he donates his family's own relatively modest allowance of $180,000 a year to charity.
He said the idea of moving toward limited democracy was being "openly discussed" within the royal family, even though it was almost never mentioned in Saudi Arabia's government-owned or monitored newspapers and television.
"We're still in the process of saying yes or no," he said. He did not say what positions were being taken by other members of the family. The orthodox view was expressed this week by Sheik Jubeir, the chairman of the appointive council, in a separate interview. "In our opinion the people who would elect the members would not choose the right people," he said. "So therefore we prefer to appoint and to choose, but within certain specifications and the rules."
In a conversation, another grandson of King Abdel Aziz also referred to intense discussions about what if any changes within the royal family Saudi Arabia ought to consider in the aftermath of the Sept. 11 attacks. 
"You'd be surprised at the issues that are discussed," said Prince Bandar bin Khalid, 36, an investment manager, "and obviously debate increases in times of crisis, like now and the gulf war."
But Prince Bandar told a visitor to his home late one recent evening, "It's something for us, the leadership, to discuss and for society to discuss, but it is not something for outsiders to impose on us or to tell us what we should be thinking."

HEADLINE: U.S. and Russia Reach Deal To Keep Sanctions on Iraq 

BYLINE:  By SERGE SCHMEMANN 

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Nov. 27 

 BODY:
After an agreement between the United States and Russia, other major members of the United Nations Security Council agreed today to postpone changing the rules for sanctions on trade with Iraq for another six months, diplomats said, keeping the existing "oil for food" program in force until then.
 The decision was dictated by the fact that the current sanctions regime expires on Friday, and not by any developments in Iraq or in the debate within the Bush administration on whether to expand its current campaign against terrorism to include a new assault on Saddam Hussein. 
 On Monday, President Bush broadly threatened that if Mr. Hussein did not re-admit United Nations weapons inspectors to Iraq, there would be unspecified consequences. 
In saying that, Mr. Bush appeared to broaden his definition of terrorism to include the development of weapons that could "terrorize nations." Today Mr. Hussein, who has refused to admit inspectors since 1998, rejected the call.
The United States has been trying for many months now to introduce new rules that would remove bans on almost all civilian exports to Iraq, while establishing a list of goods that would have to be inspected for potential military use and tightening controls on oil smuggled out of Iraq. 
Five months ago, the United States and Britain abandoned efforts to introduce the "goods review list" after Russia threatened to use its veto, and extended the existing program. That extension expires on Friday. 
This time, diplomats said the Bush administration negotiated a compromise with Russia that would extend the existing regime for six months, but on the understanding that the new rules will go into effect on June 1, 2002, with a "goods review list" that remained open to negotiations.
The compromise reflected the new mood of cooperation between the United States and Russia, and part of the deal was reportedly struck at the recent meetings between Mr. Bush and President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia. The approach also reflected a reluctance by the United States to provoke countries like Jordan, Syria and Turkey, which all have lively illegal trade with Iraq, but whose support the United States needs in the war on terrorism.
The Security Council imposed the sanctions on Iraq after it invaded Kuwait in 1990. When the sanctions threatened to create a catastrophe for Iraqi civilians, Iraq was offered a program that would allow it to sell oil. The profits go into an escrow account under United Nations control, from which they are disbursed to buy food and other civilian supplies. This "oil for food" program has been in force since 1996.
But Iraq has been using the sanctions with increasing effectiveness as a propaganda tool, accusing the United States and its allies of impoverishing its people. The new rules were intended to rob Iraq of any excuse for not supplying its people by lifting almost all restrictions on civilian imports and issuing a specific list of goods that had to be controlled.
The reasons for Russia's resistance to the idea have not been entirely clear. But as a major economic partner of Iraq, Moscow has been seeking a plan that would lead to the lifting of all sanctions. 
The greater resistance came from Turkey, Syria and Jordan, whose considerable illegal trade with Iraq has been tacitly tolerated by the United States because of the considerable trade they lost to the sanctions.
There was also some speculation among diplomats at the United Nations that the readiness of the United States to put off the new rules might reflect the debate in the administration on whether to go after Mr. Hussein. The thinking was that it would be somewhat strange to create new, more flexible sanctions rules and then to attack Iraq soon after.
Since Sept. 11, hard-line members of the administration have argued for aggressive action against Iraq. But Secretary of State Colin L. Powell has said there is no evidence linking Mr. Hussein to the terror attacks. He has also warned that an attack on Iraq would not have much support from many of the allies who support the United States' current campaign in Afghanistan.

HEADLINE: Giuliani Reproaches Teachers For Insisting on a 22% Raise 

BYLINE:  By STEVEN GREENHOUSE 

 BODY:
Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani ripped into the teachers' union yesterday, accusing it of risking grave damage to the city for continuing to seek a 22 percent wage increase even after the city's budget has plunged into deficit following the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.
 In response, Randi Weingarten, president of the United Federation of Teachers, accused Mr. Giuliani of exploiting the attacks to avoid dealing with the call for higher wages. 
 The union filed papers yesterday with a fact-finding panel assigned to make a nonbinding contract recommendation, arguing that the city needed to grant a 22 percent raise to attract the thousands of certified teachers the system needs.
Estimating that such a raise would cost $1.8 billion, Mr. Giuliani said, "That's just unrealistic. The city couldn't sustain it. It would do tremendous damage to the economy of New York City and, with all deference to the teachers' union, everybody has to show some respect to the city for what it's going through in terms of the terrible attack on the city."
Ms. Weingarten responded angrily, insisting the union was merely making the same demands it had made before the September attacks. She said, "When somebody caustically says that my members are not concerned about the city because we have the temerity to take the same position as we did before Sept. 11 -- which is what we're doing -- that's exploiting the tragedy."
The union, which represents 80,000 teachers, argued in its legal papers that teachers deserved a 22.7 percent raise to narrow the gap with their suburban peers, whose higher salaries have lured many city teachers away. Ms. Weingarten said such a raise would cost the city no more than $500 million more than the 8 percent raise that Mr. Giuliani has already budgeted for a raise for teachers', whose salaries range from $31,170 to $70,000. She accused Mr. Giuliani of refusing to negotiate seriously last year, when the city had a large budget surplus.
Mr. Giuliani ruled out negotiating an agreement with the teachers, whose contract expired 12 months ago. "There are times in negotiations when people are so far apart that you just can't reach agreement," he said. "I refuse to reach any agreement with a union -- I always have -- that would put the city's fiscal health in grave jeopardy."
In its legal papers, the union argued that educating the city's children remained a top priority and that to provide a good education the city had to raise salaries to recruit and retain enough qualified teachers. The union said the city had to think long term about improving its educational system and should not let the attacks prevent it from doing what was needed to achieve that goal.
Officials in the teachers union said they had considered dropping the fact-finding process, which often involves contentious hearings, in favor of negotiating with Mayor-elect Michael Bloomberg. But they decided to proceed with the fact-finding to avoid getting off to a bad start with Mr. Bloomberg by immediately jumping into tense negotiations.

HEADLINE: In San Juan, Bloomberg Promises Closer Ties 

BYLINE:  By JENNIFER STEINHAUER 

DATELINE: SAN JUAN, P.R., Nov. 27 

 BODY:
He stopped short of calling Puerto Rico the sixth borough, but Mayor-elect Michael R. Bloomberg today proclaimed his commitment to working closely with its government to meet business and education goals on the island and in New York City, where almost 800,000 Puerto Ricans live. 
 "I will be on Jan. 1 the mayor of the city with the largest Puerto Rican population in the world," Mr. Bloomberg said after a formal meeting with Puerto Rico's governor, Sila M. Calderon. "I think you will see her in New York," Mr. Bloomberg said of Governor Calderon, adding that he planned to visit the island often. "You'll find a lot of collaboration between the two of us." 
 Puerto Rican New Yorkers played an important role in Mr. Bloomberg's mayoral campaign, in which he took slightly less than half of the Hispanic vote. 
Mr. Bloomberg's aides said that Governor Calderon had invited the mayor-elect to San Juan; she said that Mr. Bloomberg had initiated the visit. Either way, his visit to the Dominican Republic on Monday and to Puerto Rico was the first all-business call on the two islands by a mayor-elect of New York City.
Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani took a vacation in Puerto Rico in 1993 after winning his mayoral bid, and later visited the island and the Dominican Republic when they were hammered by a hurricane in 1998. David N. Dinkins favored Puerto Rico for tennis, and other mayors in the last part of the 20th century visited the island.
But Mr. Bloomberg's agenda appears to be far broader than good-will building and vote-gathering. He said on several occasions while on both Caribbean islands that he planned numerous visits, that he would be sure to include Puerto Ricans and other members of minorities in his administration, that he planned to consult with the Puerto Rican government while forming policy that would affect Puerto Rican New Yorkers, and that he would collaborate on educational and other projects.
"There is going to be much more cooperation between these two governments that you have seen in the past," said Jerry Russo, a Bloomberg campaign spokesman.
These visits also underscore the important demographic shifts in New York City in the last decade, which left Hispanic voters in a position to sway elections.
"I was pleasantly surprised by his visit," Fernando Ferrer, the Bronx borough president, said in a telephone interview. "He makes a large statement to communities that turned out for him in unprecedented numbers." 
Ms. Calderon, whom Mr. Bloomberg has met several times, said she welcomed an invigorated relationship between New York and Puerto Rico. "In the commonwealth of Puerto Rico, you will have an ally, a collaborator and a friend," she told Mr. Bloomberg.
Mr. Bloomberg and Ms. Calderon declined to say specifically how their two governments would collaborate, but an aide to Mr. Bloomberg said that the two would confer on policy decisions and perhaps form a teacher exchange program to close the language gap for bilingual students in both places. "Ceremony will not stand in the way of a continuous dialogue," he said.
Saying that the economy in Puerto Rico directly affected New York, Mr. Bloomberg also said that he would support the Puerto Rican government's proposal to the federal government to give tax incentives to businesses that set up shop on the island. "I certainly will do whatever I can to help," Mr. Bloomberg said, though he stopped short of saying that he would directly lobby federal officials on the issue.
Mr. Bloomberg, who will need the Bush administration's financial help in getting through the city's budget woes next year, has been careful in other instances to avoid promises to directly lobby the White House.
Mr. Bloomberg said today that improving education was among his main goals, after making streets safe and employing people, and said that he wanted to see how Puerto Rico achieved its educational goals. The governor took the mayor-elect to visit a school in Santurce, an area of San Juan. At that school, Escuela Bilingue Padre Rufo, Mr. Bloomberg was met by a band playing traditional Puerto Rican music and danced a bit. This was not a good thing.
On issues talked about most on this island, Mr. Bloomberg hewed closely to safe opinions. He said that he believed that the United States should end firing exercises on the Puerto Rican island of Vieques in 2003 as planned but expressed support for the American military's presence on the island before that date. That was a slight departure from Ms. Calderon, who accepts the date offered by the Bush administration but would like to see the Navy leave the island earlier.

HEADLINE: A NATION CHALLENGED: POLICY; 
U.S. Sees Limited Mission In Postwar Afghanistan

BYLINE:  By PATRICK E. TYLER and ELAINE SCIOLINO 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 27 

 BODY:
The United States is seeking to avoid future military obligations in Afghanistan once its mission to defeat the Taliban government and destroy Al Qaeda's terrorist network is over, a senior administration official said today.
 The official, briefing reporters at the State Department, said the United States expects to be a "partner" in shaping the political and economic future of the country, but has no intention of participating in an international security force that would face the task of bringing stability to a country where warlord rivalry is a perennial challenge. 
 The official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, also said that United States had done enough on the military front by prosecuting the war against the Taliban regime in Afghanistan. And he made clear that once the Taliban was defeated and Al Qaeda rooted out, the American military role would end. 
"There's no need at that point for the coalition to still be present," the official said. He added that if an international force was necessary, "I would not imagine that the United States would be a participant in that."
At another point the official spoke of "some sharing of the burden or division of labor," with other countries taking responsibility for security.
Another senior official said that an international force could be organized with troops from countries like Germany, Jordan and Bangladesh.
Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld has indicated that it was unlikely that the United States would be part of a formal peacemaking or peacekeeping force after Osama bin Laden and Al Qaeda, his terrorist organization, were defeated.
"In terms of taking U.S. forces and having them become a part of a semipermanent peacekeeping activity in the country, I think that's highly unlikely," he said on Nov. 15. 
Deputy Defense Secretary Paul Wolfowitz has said that the Afghan habit of changing alliances makes it a dangerous place for foreigners.
"One lesson of Afghanistan that we have seen and people have seen in the past is alliances shift from month to month and year to year, and the one thing that seems to unite Afghans over long periods of time is they don't much like foreigners," Mr. Wolfowitz said on Nov. 18.
But the statements by the senior official today represented the clearest articulation of the administration's intention to shift the postwar security burden to others even as it increases its activity on the political and economic fronts. It also served as a signal to the rival anti-Taliban Afghan factions that began United Nations-sponsored talks today in Bonn intended to establish an interim government and a security structure.
Among the options is Turkey's proposal that a security force be created from Muslim countries, the senior official said in the briefing. A classic United Nations peacekeeping force is not attractive because "there's an understanding at the U.N. and elsewhere that U.N. forces don't do well" when the security situation is "messy," the official said. 
Both Secretary General Kofi Annan and Lakhdar Brahimi, the special United Nations envoy to Afghanistan, have publicly expressed their opposition to the creation of a United Nations peacekeeping force for Afghanistan because it would be too vulnerable to attack. They believe that the best approach is the eventual creation of an all-Afghan security force but that an international force will be needed in the short run.
Under the original United Nations plan for the peace talks, they were to have taken place only after an international peacekeeping force had entered Afghanistan. But the Northern Alliance, which has control of the capital of Kabul, has opposed such a deployment aHnd blocked an attempt by Britain to deploy troops near the capital.
The Bush administration sees its role as a partner with Afghanistan as it creates a new government and is committed to a vast reconstruction effort that will last "for years," the senior official said. 
On the political front the arrival of a Russian diplomatic and aid mission in Kabul prompted high level warnings from the Bush administration today that Moscow refrain from taking actions that confer legitimacy on the Northern Alliance and its president, Burhanuddin Rabbani, which is not seen as a "viable successor to the Taliban," as the senior official put it today.
A dozen Russian cargo planes carrying medical and food aid flew to Kabul on Monday after the Russian president, Vladimir V. Putin, announced that Moscow was responding to urgent pleas from the "Islamic State of Afghanistan," meaning the Rabbani government, which has been recognized by the United Nations during the Taliban's rule. 
The Russians also dispatched diplomats for what appeared to be the beginnings of a new diplomatic mission to Kabul, prompting today's warning by one United States official, who said there were concerns about countries "rushing to establish diplomatic relations with the Rabbani government, which is not seen as viable."
