HEADLINE: Union at Modern Museum To Meet Over Strike Vote

BYLINE: By GRACE GLUECK

 BODY:
The professional employees' union at the Museum of Modern Art will meet tomorrow evening to seek a strike authorization vote against the museum. The three-year contract between the museum and the union, the Professional and Administrative Staff Association, known by its acronym of Pasta, expired Oct. 31.
The open-shop union, which has 220 members, cites wages and proposed cutbacks in health insurance as its chief grievances. But museum spokesmen say their wage offering agrees with comparable salaries in the field, and they insist that escalating costs of health insurance force a reduction in what they can pay for benefits. 
 The union's members range from bookstore and information clerks to editors and associate curators and conservators. At the present time, full curators do not belong. Union spokesmen say that, despite what they view as a healthy economic outlook for the museum, the average salary for the group is $20,000 a year, with some earnings as low as $11,500 annually.
 
Givebacks in Health Insurance
 "We're asking for a 12 percent across-the-board increase in the first year of a two-year contract, with a raise of 10 percent the second year," said Mikki Carpenter, a photo archivist at the museum and the union's treasurer. "But they've only offered us 3 percent. They've also asked for givebacks in the health insurance plan that would amount to a 5 percent reduction in salary."
Ms. Carpenter also said that at the last negotiating session on Oct. 31, the museum had told the union there would be nothing in the way of further discussions "until we are ready to give back health benefits."
But Robert Batterman, outside counsel for the museum and its spokesman in labor negotiations, said the museum's health care program was "out of control," that the premiums paid for hospital and major medical insurance had risen 108 percent in the last three years.
"Compared with our sister institutions, such as the Metropolitan Museum and the Whitney, we are way out of line in terms of the scope of benefits and premiums paid," he said. And he added that the reductions sought by the museum would apply not only to the staff but to management officials as well.
 
'An Opening Proposal'
 Mr. Batterman also said that the museum's offer of a 3 percent wage increase was not intended to be final. "We have characterized that as an opening proposal," he said. "We are hoping that negotiations proceed so that we may increase that offer. But we cannot meet a demand for double-digit increases."
He added that while the average salary for the bargaining unit -- that is, the unionized employees -- was $20,500, the figure included a "significant number of bookstore clerks and visitor-desk attendants who are working at comparatively low but nevertheless market wages."
The average for professional positions was "significantly higher," Mr. Batterman said, citing figures of $35,700 as the average for incumbent associate curators, $28,600 for curatorial assistants, and $22,900 for entry-level curatorial assistants. He said that the museum was proposing "major increases" in the minimums for these three categories, but that the union itself had put lower caps on the proposals.
 
'A Red Herring'
 But Daniel Starr, associate librarian at the museum and president of the union, said the argument about minimums was "a red herring, because adjusting the minimums would not affect the salaries of anyone currently here."
"Besides," he added, "we represent people who work in many titles throughout the museum, both professional and administrative, and the average salary when you look at the whole picture means that those at the lower end of the scale are living in near-poverty conditions in New York City."
While the union painted a prosperous picture for the museum's future, Mr. Batterman said, the truth was that it faced a deficit for fiscal 1991, and that the recession had cut into its endowment and investment programs. But he added, "Since the one Pasta strike in 1973, we've had a very good relationship with the union, and no one in management is looking to damage that relationship."
Mr. Starr said, "We've managed in those years to settle our contracts without a strike, but the situation this time is quite different. We've never been faced with a proposal for such drastic cutbacks with the museum in sound financial shape. We've always had the bad salaries justified by the good benefits, but now they're trying to eliminate the benefits and leave the salaries back where they've been all along."

HEADLINE: Toss the Rascals Out; Just the Rascals

 BODY:
California, Colorado and Kansas City vote today on proposals to limit terms of elected officials. Indeed, Californians are voting on two such proposals, one stricter than the other, and both are expected to carry. The very idea is a bad omen.
Public frustration with entrenched politicians who don't perform is understandable. But arbitrarily throwing out the good with the bad is simplistic and, worse, undemocratic. It is far more important that voters be free to make choices. 
 According to a Gallup poll last winter, the term-limitation idea is popular nationwide. The driving premise is that long-term incumbents lose touch with their constituents but are virtually unbeatable. So the answer is to force them all out after a specified time; the maximum term most commonly proposed is 12 years.
The premise itself is faulty. While it's true that some 98 percent of incumbent Congressmen who seek re-election have been successful in recent years, it's also true that, over time, there is substantial turnover. Two-thirds of the House's members in 1990 weren't there in 1980.
Proponents of term limitation claim to be politically neutral, but the most active tend to be Republican, conservative and anti-tax. President Bush, reflecting his own problems with the Democrats' seemingly unbreakable control of Congress, has endorsed the stricter of the two California proposals, which would impose a lifetime limit of eight years for state legislators.
The advocates of limitation have clearly touched a sensitive nerve. The budget gridlock in Washington this year is one good reason for public unhappiness. But rising taxes, shrinking public services and the spreading pain of a slack economy create discontent with all levels of government.
So why don't dissatisfied voters cast the ins out? Because incumbents have enormous advantages -- abundant campaign funds to overwhelm underfinanced challengers, large staffs that tend to constituents' problems no matter how trivial, free-mail franking privileges for self-promoting newsletters that pretend to be "official business," and carefully gerrymandered districts that insure solid blocs of support on Re-Election Day.
The proper answer to these built-in advantages is reform, starting with the disgraceful gusher of political action committee contributions and special-interest honorariums. Alas, despite growing public pressure for a healthy cleansing of campaign finance laws, there is little evidence that legislators are interested. As long as they resist reform they invite the public attitude that's embodied in term limitation.
But term limitation is the wrong response. At every level, the nation needs good men and women in government. Term limits make no distinction between the worthy and the undeserving. They deny America its right to the continued service of experienced leaders. And they deny Americans the right to make up their own minds.

HEADLINE: Japanese Challenge Will Increase

 BODY:
To the Editor:
In "Japan, Land of the Setting Sun" (Op-Ed, Oct. 24), Roy Smith contends that Japan has peaked as a financial superpower. Many American corporate leaders and policy makers may find solace in this assertion, but they would be better served instead by gearing up for an increasing Japanese economic challenge.
Mr. Smith focuses on declining Japanese trade surpluses and stock markets as evidence that Japan's financial superpower days are over. While imports have decreased the trade surplus of Japan, the trend has been to the benefit of Japanese producers, who have increased competitiveness by using lower priced inputs. Japan's trade surplus with the United States is stuck at $50 billion and shows no signs of further significant decline.
Mr. Smith contends that growing overseas production by Japan is breaking up the "monolithic Japanese manufacturing system." Rather, Japanese overseas investment is expanding the manufacturing system to take better advantage of the enormous American and European markets. Japan is also exporting its Keiretsu system, the intercompany relationships that bind producers and suppliers, spelling serious trouble for United States suppliers in numerous industries.
No one would argue with Mr. Smith that the Japanese have bought high during the last few years -- in art and real estate and corporate securities -- and have also suffered enormous foreign-exchange losses. But given the long-term perspective of these increasingly global investors, their paper losses seem less important.
Mr. Smith states that the "strategic content of Japan's enormous foreign investments has been especially thin." However, that Toyota and Nomura neglected to buy a controlling interest in Chrysler or Merrill Lynch might say more about the undesirability of those American companies than about a lack of strategic planning by the Japanese. The Japanese have made enormous strategic investments in the United States: semiconductor and biotechnology companies, investment banks such as the Blackstone Group and Shearson Lehman Hutton. Mr. Smith need not be reminded of Sumitomo Bank's 12.5 percent equity stake in his own Goldman, Sachs & Company.
The term superpower has absolute and relative implications. In an absolute sense, Japan does not seem as financially invincible today as it did before its stock market decline and rise in interest rates. But in relative terms, its economy is still awe inspiring. Its growth rate this year, in excess of 5 percent, can only be the envy of a United States sliding into recession. Japan's savings rate is still one of the highest in the world. Its Government is looking at a budget surplus this year, and its reduction of debt in the last few years leaves it able to manage future recessions. Corporations are only beginning to reap the benefits of massive productive investments that have outstripped United States competitors.
With the yen near a record high in relation to the dollar, and with an
economy more energy-efficient than ever, Japan seems set to weather these turbulent times with fewer dislocations than any other economy. By almost any measure, Japan remains a financial superpower in its own right, but certainly so when compared with the troubled United States economy.

HEADLINE: Young, Successful But Between Jobs

BYLINE: By JON NORDHEIMER

 BODY:
IT was the ideal pairing of young urban professionals: two careers on Wall Street, a wedding, a slice of cake, a short honeymoon and back to the office grind.
He paid the mortgage out of his bank account and she made the auto and Bloomingdale's payments out of hers. Each kept credit cards from the bachelor days. 
 Then the roof fell in. His job was terminated this summer. Hers was in jeopardy. Their investments in stocks and real estate, which still looked golden in the spring, had turned to dross by autumn.
This is not a screenplay. It is straight from the current files of Budget and Credit Counseling Services of New York, which helps its clients to rein in binge spending. Luther R. Gatling, the service's president, says the case is far from unusual these days.
In New York and other Northeastern cities, where 50,000 jobs in the securities business have vanished since the 1987 stock market collapse and tens of thousands of additional white collar positions were cut this year, economic adversity is shoving many people under the age of 35 out of extended adolescence and into something like a midlife crisis, questioning their self-worth and values.
"He's been jolted into reality but she's still on her fantasy trip -- she still believes in the tooth fairy," Mr. Gatling said of the newlyweds. The man was a banker and the woman a marketing analyst and the marriage remained threatened unless she accepted the new limits on their lives.
"The panic is on, and it's happening this time in upper-middle-class neighborhoods and high-income brackets where the 1987 stock market crash hardly made a dent," said Mr. Gatling, who serves clients referred to the service by American Express and other creditors seeking payment on delinquent accounts.
The panic comes just as many members of the younger half of the generation born after 1955 have been deepening their social and financial commitments: -- forming families and taking on mortgages. For those who thought they had bought the ultimate insurance when they chose to study business administration -- or law, in anticipation of tough competition from their peers -- the pain of diminished professional prospects is almost too great to bear, especially when the value of investments like real estate is also crumbling.
"If they lose their job, they lose their center of gravity," said Dr. Mari Terzaghi, a midtown Manhattan clinical psychologist with a number of patients who have lost ousted from powerful positions in the financial industry. "Everything in their lives has been a quick fix and they are bewildered by the world closing in on them," she said.
For women, changing assumptions about careers may reinforce doubts about trade-offs between work and family.
"My friends say if my career's not working out, maybe I should settle down and have kids," said 30-year-old Carolyn Fielding of White Plains, who lost her job as a marketing and sales representative last spring. "But I don't want to wake up five years down the line,." she went on, "and say I took the easy way out and the only reason I'm married is that I lost my job in 1990."
In these times, many decisions have, it turns out, rested on shaky foundations. Mel Rottkov, who is single and, 37 and lives in Manhattan, left a $50,000 public-relations position last year to earn a graduate degree that would move his career in another direction. In the spring, nervously watching the economic slide, he decided to go back to work, to discover that jobs paying $50,000 were no longer available to him. He took up driving a cab to tide him over until the right offer came along.
"I was the only guy in my taxi school whose first language was English," said Mr. Rottkov. Now, he said, he is looking for positions paying $25,000 and is still stuck behind the wheel 12 hours a day.
"I used to be a yuppie," he said., "Nnow I am a puppy: -- a poor urban professional."
That prospect is still unreal for the legions of well-paid young people who are unencumbered by children and mortgages, though they may not have to look farther than the nearest T-shirt to see that the mood has shifted to the "underachiever" of Bart Simpson from such 80's statements as "When the going gets tough, the tough go shopping."
"The yuppie image of being self-centered and somewhat arrogant is not something I am proud of, but it did seem that hard work produced a lot of money and good times," said Mark Santino, a single 28-year-old Pittsburgh stockbroker. Rumblings of bad times ahead caused him to curtail some spending, like "going into a bar and buying rounds for your buddies," but not much, he said. commented. Mr. Santino said he earned a six-figure income last year.
Said his friend, Nori Passavino, a 30-year-old marketing officer for a Pittsburgh bank, also single: "If worse came to worst and I lost my job I'd just jump in my car and head to Aspen, ski all winter and wait on tables,"
And what if there were still no jobs when the snow melted?
A note of surprise filled her voice at the prospect. "My attitude is to roll with what happens," she responded.
"There's no question our attitude was we were put on this earth to have fun," said Susan Lamoureaux, a 31-year-old job recruiter with D. J. Hertz employment service in New York. "A lot of people looked at us like we were spoiled brats and deserved a comeuppance. But the boom was just normal for us; -- we never knew anything different.
Now she is married and expecting a baby next year. "I'm getting used to carrying lunch to work and treating vacations like a luxury instead of a routine," she saiId.
Older and more battered by the shrinking economy is Charles Goodgal, a 36-year-old New York options trader who has a master's degree in business administration from the Wharton School of Finance of the University of Pennsylvania. "In 1986 and '87 it was a gravy train; -- they were giving money away on Wall Street," Mr. Goodgal recalled.
The 1987 market crash put him out of business for five months but he resumed trading "and made a few dollars -- not in Fat City, but luckier than most."
Feeling financially secure again, he and his wife, Nita Silverman, a successful businesswoman who said she earned a six-figure income as president of marketing for a large cosmetics concern, decided to have a baby. Last January she quit to devote herself to raising her son, Matthew, now 2. In June they sold their Greenwich Village apartment and bought a house in Ridgewood, N.J.
"Emotionally it was the right thing, because we wanted to get away from the city and all its problems, but we went into it blindly," said Ms. Silverman, who is also 36. Four weeks into their new home, they find found a new word in their vocabulary: budget.
"When I was working, we never bothered to consult each other about a purchase of $500 or so," she said. "Now we do. We are also postponing purchases like new furniture for our bedroom and putting things we thought we had earned -- a baby grand piano for me and a Porsche sports car for Chuck -- on the back burner.,"
And they are discussing whether to have a second child or whether Ms. Silverman should return to work, though she has no assurance she can could re-enter the job market at her previous income figure.
The sweeping layoffs, especially in the financial and retail industries, have dealt a disproportionate blow to managers of Ms. Silverman's age or younger, not just by eliminating jobs but by reining in the ambitions of those still employed.
"People of high caliber are not risking going to another firm that wants them," said Adele Ribolow-Berk, head of a Manhattan job-recruitment firm specializing in the publishing field. "They stick with the security of the old company."
That means channels within a corporation or firm may be clogged by executives in their 40's and 50's, creating additional agitation among junior members.
"My patients are very bitter," said Brian McDonald, a psychoanalyst to whom patients are referred from employee assistance programs in troubled Wall Street organizations. "Many of them came from upper-middle-income families and went to all the correct schools and felt they had a passport to success. Now they're 30 years old and making $30,000 a year and they'll never do as well as their parents. The only benefit they see is now they can get a seat on the subway at rush hour because there've been so many layoffs below Chambers Street."
If the economy remains stagnant for an extended length of time, these new limits may hasten the process of re-evaluation and cultural change, market researchers and other analysts say.
"It becomes a good excuse to get out of the rat race and focus on more solid concerns," said Hy Mariampolski, president of QualiData Research, a New York market research concern.
"We are already seeing a turning toward more conservative and practical spending," he said. "In gift-giving the trend is toward more useful items for the home than throw-away stuff that was the hallmark of the 80's."
Clinton Sanders, a University of Connecticut sociologist who specializes in popular culture, says he hopes that young professionals, notorious known as they are for lack of interest in social or political issues, activism, will use the recession to reassess their own lives and tackle larger social issues, a trend -- something he says he already sees in growing concern for the environment. He said,
"A group so singlemindedly focused and habituated by work would be a potent leadership force," he said, "if it turned away from success and acquisition and put itself to work on the more problematic issues out there."
Dr. Douglas LaBier, a Washington psychologist who is working on a book he calls "Reclaiming the Promise: Growing Up at Mid-life," says he believes the generation is yearning for deeper moral values.
"The young men and women I see as patients and in my research want to mix career competency with vision and purpose but are absolutely lacking models," he said. "This generation has to create its own."
Marilee Hartley, co-author with Marissa Piesman of the satirical appraisal of the baby-boom generation's love affair with materialism and trends, "The Yuppie Handbook" (Long Shadow Books, 1984), said she believed the coincidental move of people in their late 20's and 30's into marriage and child-rearing will provide them with the grit to survive hard times.
"They're already scaling back, devoting less time to brunching and finding the celebrity chefs," said Ms. Hartley, 45, who writes a newsletter for the office of Mayor David N. Dinkins of New York City. "Maybe it's about time we started calling the baby boomers 'adults'; -- their long adolescence is over."

HEADLINE: A Move to Define Teaching A Cut Above the Average

BYLINE: By SUZANNE DALEY

 BODY:
What does it take to make a great teacher? And once you have one, how do you know?
The National Board for Professional Teaching Standards will announce tomorrow that it has hired a research team to design the first of 34 tests to measure excellence in teaching. 
 The board, an independent group that has been trying for four years to toughen the standards of the teaching profession, wants to create the first national system for identifying the best teachers in various fields. It plans to begin its certification system by 1993.
The research team, headed by a University of Pittsburgh professor, is expected to come up with a test for English teachers that will include the use of videotaped classroom activity and exercises in which teachers would face simulated problems, a spokesman for the board said.
"Nobody is going to get board-certified with a No. 2 pencil in their hand," said Joan Baratz-Snowden, the board's vice president for assessment and research. "We've got to break the idea that assessment is a row of five bubbles."
 
 Raising Status and Salaries
 The aim of the project is to eventually form a distinguished cadre of board-certified professionals who will enhance the status of teaching, raise salaries and by their example attract more talented people into the field.
The research team, headed by Prof. Anthony R. Petrosky of the University of Pittsburgh, a poet who is also a leading researcher in assessment models, has been awarded a $1.5 million contract to develop a test for English teachers who work primarily with students from the ages to 11 to 15, the board said. Around the country there are about 100,000 such teachers.
Professor Petrosky will be working in conjunction with Connecticut's Department of Education, which has been in the forefront of state efforts to overhaul licensing practices by using assessments based on performance. The team will also have several teachers as participants throughout the research.
"I'm particularly interested in a videotape portfolio," Professor Petrosky said, "in seeing a seqence of lessons, so that you could get a sense of the narrative or story that the lessons would tell."
The use of videotapes instead of observations by a local principal, for instance, would allow the board to use a team of very experienced teachers to review large numbers of candidates for certification. The team would have established and uniform criteria for judging the work.
 
 Supplement to a License
 Professor Petrosky said teachers might be able to choose their own tapes and to include a written statement explaining what the tapes were meant to show.
The 63-member board, created in 1986 by the Carnegie Forum on Education and the Economy, intends to use its certification procedures to supplement, not replace, teacher certification tests that are administered by individual states.
State education departments now grant teaching licenses to graduates of an accredited teacher training program, in most cases after they have passed tests of general knowledge and knowledge of teaching.
The new credential, by contrast, is to be voluntary and will be designed to set a standard of excellence for experienced teachers. A teacher will need at least three years' experience before he or she can take the test. The board hopes teachers who gain certification will be paid more.

The Push to Recycle Newsprint

BYLINE: By JOHN HOLUSHA

 BODY:
With environmental concerns rising and a growing number of governments requiring publishers to use recycled paper, makers of newsprint in North America are rushing into recycling. After showing little interest for years, they are investing $1.5 billion to $2 billion in equipment that will allow them to use scrap paper as well as trees as raw material.
"At the begining of 1989, of the 43 newsprint mills in North America, only 9 used recycled fibers," said John Ruston, a solid-waste specialist at the Environmental Defense Fund. "With the announcements that have been made since then, there will be at least 26 mills with that capability." 
 Many suppliers of newsprint had been reluctant to get involved in recycling because of the difficulty and expense of collecting old newspapers in cities and shipping them to mills in remote locations.
But with seven states having adopted laws requiring recycled paper in newspapers and legislation pending in other places, newspaper publishers have been pushing their suppliers to act. In the last year close to two dozen newsprint recycling projects have been announced or declared under consideration in the United States and Canada.
For example, Atlantic Packaging Ltd., is scheduled to open a mill later this year in Whitby, Ontario, that will produce 135,000 tons of newsprint a year, solely from old newspapers.
Industry officials say the number of announced projects understates the level of interest. "From the number of inquiries we get, we know there are a lot more feasibility studies under way," said J. Rodney Edwards, a vice president of the American Paper Institute. "We are going to see a lot more recycling of newspapers, corregated board and pre-sorted office white papers."
Carl C. Landegger, chairman of the Black Clawson Company, an equipment supplier, said, "The chief executive of every newsprint company in North America, without exception, has quotations for recycling equipment sitting on his desk."
 
Too Much Paper
 Newspapers represent 8 percent of all solid waste, and have become an early focus of many programs in which homeowners separate their trash. But last year recycling programs, particularly in the Northeast, ran into a jam. The amount of paper collected overwhelmed the plants available to process it.
As a result, warehouses were filled and the value of used paper plunged. Homeowners who had faithfully separated their newspapers for recycling were dismayed to learn that their communities were paying upward of $100 a ton to have it hauled to landfills. Since then, the glut has eased because of increased exports.
Prices paid for old newspapers vary greatly by region. A ton of old newspapers brings $25 to $35 in California while in the New York City area recently a ton brought $3, and in some cases cost $7 to haul away.
Despite the problem, many paper companies hesitated about making investments in new plants and equipment because new production capacity already planned, largely for virgin newsprint, was expected to saturate the market and hold down prices.
To force the pace of recycling, state legislatures in Connecticut, California, Florida, Minnesota, Maryland, Wisconsin and North Carolina adopted laws requiring newspaper publishers to use recycled paper and imposed fines and taxes if they did not. And some local governments, including Suffolk County's on Long Island, have mandated that newsprint have a 40 percent content of recycled fiber by 1996. Federal legislation has also been introduced, but Congress adjourned without taking action.
 
Voluntary Agreements
 In other states, including New York, publishers and state officials reached voluntary agreements to use more paper with recycled content. The goal is to increase the use of recycled newsprint to 40 percent of all newsprint by the end of the decade, provided the material is available.
With the New York agreement assuring a ready market for its product, the Jefferson Smurfit Corporation announced in September that it would build a mill in upstate New York to produce 250,000 tons of newsprint a year from 330,000 tons of waste paper that would come from the New York City and Boston areas, among others. Jefferson Smurfit, which is based in St. Louis, is already the nation's largest producer of recycled newsprint.
But most of the newsprint industry is taking a more conservative approach -- adding recycling machinery to existing mills. Known as de-inking equipment, it reduces old newspapers to a pulp of wood fibers in a large vat of water and removes the particles of ink. The cleaned fiber can be formed into new paper that is 100 percent recycled or combined with virgin fibers.
This is the technology in use at the Garden State Paper Company's plant in Garfield, N.J., the only newspaper-recycling plant in the New York area.
According to the Canadian Pulp and Paper Association, the new equipment will increase the North American demand for waste paper in newsprint production from 1.55 million metric tons in 1989 to 3.07 million by 1992. About 60 percent of the 13 million tons of newsprint consumed in the United States annually is imported from Canada.
 
Jump in Market Share Seen
 "By last April we could see that the market share for recycled newsprint would increase from 14 percent to 28 percent by 1992," said Tonda F. Rush, vice president for industry affairs at the American Newspaper Publishers Association. Since then the announcement of new mills and equipment "makes it clear that the share will go as high as 35 percent, as long as the economy is O.K. and the collection systems do not collapse," he said.
Industry officials say that adding de-inking equipment to an existing mill costs $60 million to $80 million, compared with $400 million to $450 million for a new mill. But new recycling mills can be placed close to urban areas, as they do not need vast expanses of trees for raw material, and so transportation costs are lowered. Industry people said the new Jefferson Smurfit mill would probably be along the Hudson River north of Albany.
Transportation will still present a problem for distant mills, but Canadian producers are counting on the fact that Canada ships more bulk commodities, like paper, to the United States than is shipped back. "If railroad cars and trucks are being backhauled empty, then you can fill them with with waste paper," said Mr. Edwards of the paper institute.
 
A Concern About Supply
 Newsprint producers contemplating investments in recycling equipment are concerned about insuring a steady supply of old newspapers and the quality of the waste they receive. Mr. Ruston of the environmental fund said some are negotiating with city sanitation commissioners who will have large amounts of material available as trash separation programs take hold across the country.
But the quality of municipal collection is often not good, Mr. Edwards said. "People tend to interleaf the newspapers with mail and magazines as a way to get rid of them," he said. These other paper products can act as contaminants in the recycling process, forcing mills to add costly operations to separate them.

Precious Metals Advance On Heightened War Fears

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Heightened fears of war in the Middle East spurred a rally in the precious metal markets yesterday.
Gold futures settled $7 to $7.40 higher on New York's Commodity Exchange, with the active contract for delivery in December at $388.10 an ounce. The November contract climbed $7.10, to $386.60. Silver was 3 cents to 3.2 cents higher, with December at $4.257 an ounce. 
 Platinum futures finished $6.10 to $10.20 higher on the New York Mercantile Exchange, with November at $426.80 an ounce.
Analysts said speculation was mounting that the United States-led military force in Saudi Arabia would soon attack Iraqi troops in occupied Kuwait. Randolph Donney, chief commodities analyst with the Pegasus Econometric Group in Hoboken, N.J., said some analysts expected an offensive as early as this weekend.
He said the rally was fueled by signs that the Soviet Union might send troops to the region to bolster the United Nations force and by perceptions that Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d was "laying down the ground rules" for an attack during his visit to allies in the Middle East.
Other analysts cited the views of some military strategists that a strike would best be started in November, before the desert winter sets in.
"There are lot of things coming into play and I think you're getting a little bit of a war scare there," Mr. Donney said. Gold is often viewed as an investment haven in times of international crisis.
Bernard Savaiko, senior metals analyst with Paine Webber Inc., linked further buying to signs of firming demand for gold at the recent low prices and to evening of positions in advance of Friday's expiration of December gold options on the Commodity Exchange.
Pork futures rallied strongly on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, helping to lift the cattle markets. Near-term hog futures rose the permitted daily limit of 1.5 cents a pound and all pork belly contracts soared the 2 cents-a-pound limit on signs of slow slaughter rates and ideas that the markets have reached a seasonal bottom.
Prices of soybean futures prices fell to their lowest levels in eight months on the Chicago Board of Trade as signs of slack demand and large yields prompted selling and profit taking. Wheat futures ended slightly higher. Corn was slightly lower.
A survey of grain analysts disclosed that most experts expect the Agriculture Department to raise its 1990 soybean crop estimate tomorrow from last month's projection of 1.82 billion bushels.

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
Simulating Competition

BYLINE: By Peter Passell

 BODY:
DO consumers still benefit from the regulation of long-distance phone rates? Not so long ago the American Telephone and Telegraph Company was almost universally regarded as a puma amidst newborn kittens -- a powerful beast, whose predatory instincts made it untrustworthy out of sight of its Government keepers.
But in the last few years A.T.&T.'s rivals, notably the MCI Communications Corporation and U S Sprint, have grown claws of their own. And with the support of the Bush Administration, the Federal Communications Commission is proposing to lengthen A.T.&T.'s leash, with the thought of one day letting free markets rather than regulation protect consumers' interests. 
That would suit A.T.&T., which would like to move aggressively to shore up its 60 percent-plus share of the lucrative large-customer business market. But the proposal is drawing howls of protest from competitors that have only recently grown comfortably profitable.
A.T.&T.'s rivals score a few points in the resulting war of words between distinguished economic consultants. But to the degree that the hired guns succeed in raising doubts about the potential for healthy competition in long-distance phones, a larger, unspoken question becomes more difficult to ignore: How does the simulated rivalry between a handful of phone companies that apparently cannot be allowed to fail better serve the public better than a plain old-fashioned regulated monopoly?
Under current rules, all long-distance phone companies are free to set rates, offer new services and negotiate special deals for valued customers. Check that: all but one. As a "dominant carrier"A.T.&T. cannot raise or lower rates by 5 percent or more without permission from regulators. And it must provide plenty of notice to its rivals in case they want to match the offer.
The commission argues that the rationale for this discrimination against A.T.&T. is losing its force. A.T.&T.'s rivals are now big enough, rich enough and competent enough to deter a predatory price-cutting attack.
What is more, the commission says, U S Sprint and MCI's enormous investments in excess capacity make it unlikely that A.T.&T. would be able to gouge customers. If the phone giant raised prices, competitors would be well positioned to take away their business.
Three consultants for U S Sprint, Steven Salop, Steven Brenner and Gary Roberts of Charles River Associates demur. The costs of transforming the smaller phone companies' maze of fiber-optic cable into a functioning network would exceed the commission's estimate by billions of dollars. Moreover, for some A.T.&T. customers -- notably those with 800 numbers that would have to be changed --leaving the A.T.&T. family would be expensive.
But it is not rate increases that U S Sprint fears. Just the opposite: A.T.&T.'s rivals worry about price cuts that would force them to sacrifice profits in order to hang onto valued customers. And here the Charles River trio offer a novel argument in defense of their client.
Many potential customers, they assert, including some who were burned after Ma Bell's breakup, incorrectly believe that non-A.T.&T. service is inferior. Thus if A.T.&T. were free to price as it wished, it would discriminate, lowering rates to gain savvy price-sensitive customers and raising rates for customers who believed A.T.&T's advertisements. At the very least, Steven Salop argues, deregulation should be delayed until customers are given time to see how good non-A.T.&T. service can be.
The best guess now, analysts argue, is that the F.C.C. will find a politically acceptable compromise, deregulating at a sufficiently cautious pace to keep U S Sprint and MCI from taking their case to their friends in Congress. Indeed, the one near certainty in the not-so-brave new world of long-distance telephone regulation is that, once established, every company will be given sufficient support by regulators to stay in business.
Therein lies the rub. As the architects of telephone divestiture in the early 1980's understood, it takes competitors to create and maintain a competitive market. But the addition of profitable service providers was a means of insuring competition, not an end in itself. The F.C.C. now finds itself running a cartel, favoring smaller companies over the larger one in the expectation that the market will someday be self-sustaining.
But what happens if, as seems increasingly likely, that someday never comes? Is America really better off with a telephone cartel regulated in the interests of its weaker members than with a monopoly that must justify its pricing policies to the Government?

HEADLINE: Productivity on the Increase But Hours Worked Decline

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 6

 BODY:
The productivity of American workers climbed at the fastest pace in two years during the July-September quarter, but hours worked fell, the Government said today, in a sign that the economic slowdown is forcing businesses to make do with fewer employees.
"The good news is that productivity is up; the bad news is we're in a recession," said Michael K. Evans, a Washington-based economic consultant. 
 In the third quarter, non-farm productivity -- output per hour of work -- advanced at a 1.6 percent seasonally adjusted annual rate compared with the previous three-month period. It was the third consecutive improvement and the best pace since the July-September quarter of 1988.
Productivity rose three-tenths of a percent in the second quarter, fell 1.3 percent in the first quarter and dropped 2.5 percent in the fourth quarter of last year.
However, the number of hours worked edged down one-tenth of 1 percent in the third quarter, the first decline in more than four years. Economists say this shows that employers are coping with economic sluggishness with layoffs, hiring freezes and limits on overtime.
 
'Better, but Subpar'
 "What's happened here is that in 1989 the economy was very weak, but business optimism was still strong and businesses didn't lay off people," Mr. Evans said. "Productivity has picked up because they are laying off people who should have been laid off last year."
Despite the improvement, productivity is still well below the level needed to increase Americans' living standard significantly, according to most economists.
"It's better, but subpar," said Allen Sinai, an economist with the Boston Company.
Increased productivity, or getting each worker to produce more during each hour of work, is vital to increasing the nation's standard of living without inflation.
Non-farm productivity is increasing at an average annual pace of two-tenths of 1 percent so far this year, compared with a seven-tenths of 1percent decline for all of last year.
Since 1982, productivity growth has averaged 1.6 percent a year -- better than the 1.2 percent average in the 1970's but far worse than the 2.5 percent annual gain posted from 1947 to 1967.
Mr. Sinai said manufacturing, where productivity leaped at a 5.6 percent annual rate in the third quarter, compared with 2.6 percent for all of last year, is making impressive gains. However, productivity growth in the service sector, which accounts for a much larger share of the economy, remains dismal, he said.
Meanwhile, hourly labor costs, a major indication of inflation for businesses, shot up 4.5 percent in the third quarter. That was an improvement over the 5 percent rate in the second quarter but still worse than the 3.2 percent increase for all of 1989.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Treasury Auction Starts Off Well

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
The largest auctions of Treasury debt ever started off well yesterday, as a wide spectrum of investors easily absorbed a record $12.5 billion in three-year notes.
But traders said strong demand for the first leg of the Treasury's quarterly refunding auctions did not necessarily mean that sales of 10-year notes and 30-year bonds today and tomorrow would be as successful. A total of $34.25 billion in new notes and bonds will be sold this week. 
 With the forthcoming debt sales, the prices of long-term bonds and notes dipped slightly in the secondary market for Treasury securities, nudging interest rates higher.
 
Traders Are Confident
 Recession fears and the short maturity of the notes sold yesterday made traders confident that the three-year auction would go well.
At the auction, just under $47 billion worth of bids were placed for the securities, which were sold at an average yield of 7.78 percent.
The rate is down from the average yield of 8.10 percent at the last three-year note auction on Aug. 7, and is the lowest yield on a three-year note since Nov. 9 of last year, when three-year notes were sold at an average yield of 7.77 percent.
Market participants said yesterday that demand for the securities came from a broad range of investors, including banks, insurance companies and foreign investors, particularly Middle Eastern accounts.
But demand from Japanese investors, who have bought large chunks of Treasury securities at past auctions, was minuscule, traders said, with the four largest Japanese securities houses purchasing only 5 percent of the notes sold yesterday.
"The three-year was the easy one," said Ward McCarthy, a managing director at Stone & McCarthy Research Associates, a firm in Princeton, N.J., that provides research and commentary on developments in the foreign exchange and credit markets.
"Interest rates may have to rise a bit to sell the 10-year and the 30-year, but not a lot," he added. "There is plenty of cash available to finance these auctions if investors are in the right mood, and I think they are."
 
Looking to Fed Action
 Weak economic conditions are encouraging investors to buy Treasury securities. Most analysts are forecasting that the Federal Reserve Board will move quickly to push down interest rates to prevent a prolonged recession. Such conditions tend to favor fixed-income securities.
"In the wrong environment, new supply can be terrible for the market," a Government bond trader said.
"But right now, it is great. The consensus view is that the Fed will move to ease policy again in the next 10 days, and perhaps once more after that before the end of the year. From that perspective, that means that while current yield levels are not a value now, they will be soon."
Late yesterday, the $11 billion worth of 10-year notes to be auctioned today were offered on a when-issued basis at a price to yield 8.51 percent, up from 8.48 percent late on Monday. The $10.75 billion in 30-year bonds to be sold tomorrow were offered at a price to yield 8.64 percent, compared to 8.62 percent late on Monday.
 
Secondary Rates Down
 Profit taking and preparations for the remaining two auctions depressed note and bond prices in the secondary market for Treasury securities. Some market analysts said prices had reached unrealistically high levels even if a recession was on the horizon.
"Recession does not equal a bond rally," said Joel Marver, chief fixed-income analyst at Thomson Financial Networks Bond Data Technical Service in Boston.
"In seven out of the last nine years, the bond market has rallied in October and November," Mr. Marver added. "But I wouldn't expect this rally to persist through the end of the month, and would convince clients to get much more defensive."
In the secondary market for Treasury securities, the 8 3/4 percent 30-year bonds of 2020 were offered at a price of 101 7/32 late yesterday, down by 5/ 32, to yield 8.63 percent. Late Monday, the benchmark issue was offered at a price to yield 8.61 percent. Since mid-October, bond yields have fallen by more than 40 basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point.
Among note issues, the 8 1/2 percent five-year notes were offered at 101 19/32, down by 2/32, to yield 8.09 percent. And the 7 3/4 percent two-year notes were offered at 100 6/32, down by 2/32, to yield 7.64 percent.
 
Short-Term Rates Up
 Short-term Treasury bill rates rose.
In late trading, three-month bills were offered at a discount rate of 7.07 percent, up by 3 basis points. Six-month bill rates rose by a like amount, to a late offered rate of 7.06 percent. And one-year bill rates rose by 4 basis points, to a late offered rate of 6.88 percent.
Following are the results of yesterday's auction of three-year Treasury notes:

HEADLINE: A Risky Business for State Farm

BYLINE: By ERIC N. BERG, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BLOOMINGTON, Ill.

 BODY:
In normal times, Edward B. Rust Jr., chairman and chief executive of State Farm, would be euphoric about taking policyholders away from rival insurance companies. But times are far from normal in the car insurance business.
Competitors ranging from Aetna to Travelers to Cigna are curtailing or abandoning their auto coverage in many states, but Mr. Rust is anything but euphoric. The reason, as he is all too aware, is that the companies believe that state-mandated rate cuts, rapidly escalating car repair bills and skyrocketing injury awards by juries are making it hard for them to make much money on auto policies. 
 That puts the State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company, the nation's largest auto insurer, with more than 33.6 million policies in force, at a crossroads. As many companies retrench, tens of thousands of new customers will be coming State Farm's way in the next few years. But many of the motorists will either have poor driving records or live in states like California and New Jersey, which insurers consider the most regulated and least profitable in which to do business.
If State Farm declines the new business, the company risks losing market share to other big insurers like No. 2 Allstate and No. 3 Farmers Group, which it strongly wants to avoid. But if State Farm pursues the business aggressively, it could find itself stuck with a large number of high-risk, money-losing policies. Still, the company plans to forge ahead, counting on its 17,500 agents to make the new business profitable by taking in enough money from premiums to outweigh any added losses.
To be sure, State Farm is not alone. Farmers, Geico, Allstate, the Nationwide group and the USAA group are among other large insurers that remain committed to writing automobile policies. They, too, could also face mounting claims if they rush too fast to add new business.
But Mr. Rust has more reason than most of his counterparts to be worried. The auto insurance business has been a big loser of late, and State Farm, which was founded here in 1922 to provide low-cost auto coverage to farmers, has done worse than the average. It also has some of the lowest rates of any major insurer, typically 10 percent to 15 percent below its competititon. That makes the company, with its longtime "Just Like a Good Neighbor" marketing theme, attractive to consumers, but leaves it with less room for mistakes.
 
'Worried by the Turmoil'
 Finally, State Farm is accustomed to dealing with a broad cross-section of drivers and culling out the worst. This time the available pool of new business will consist heavily of drivers with blemished records, because independent insurance brokers not paid by State Farm will place many of the better ones with other companies. That leaves the company facing the higher risk of picking the least bad from the bad.
"'m just not saying, 'Hot dog, let the business come!' Mr. Rust said in a recent interview at his Bloomington office. "I'm worried by the turmoil out there."
On State Farm's side is that its agents have excelled historically at separating out poor risks. But this time they are heading into mostly uncharted waters.
While in most cases the agents will have access to the driving records of potential customers, it still typically takes a year or longer for a new insurer to really know how well a motorist drives.
And some states require insurance companies to write automobile policies if they also want to offer more lucrative homeowners and business insurance.
Last year, companies selling auto-liability policies to individuals paid $1.17 in claims, agent commissions and other selling expenses for every dollar in premium revenue they took in, according to the A .M. Best Company, the big research firm based in Oldwick, N.J. While 10 cents earned on the dollar in investment income helped reduce the losses, most auto insurers still had a net loss of about 7 cents on every dollar of premium revenue.
While many of State Farm's private-passenger auto liability policies were profitable, over all the company lost 17.9 cents on these policies for every dollar in premium revenue it took in. Investment income restored 10.5 cents, making State Farm's net losses on these policies 7.4 cents on every dollar.
 
More Business, More Losses?
 "It does not take much imagination to see that more business could mean more losses, particularly in places like California," said Barbara Stewart, a partner in Stewart Economics, a leading industry consulting firm based in Chapel Hill, N.C.
Automobile insurers often point to California and New Jersey as emblematic of states in which it is tough to operate because of sharp rate reductions and strict state regulations on coverage. Consumer advocates note that many of the rules were made because of motorists' outrage over high premiums and what they saw as other corporate abuses.
The industry has also faced similar actions in Pennsylvania, Virginia, Michigan, Massachusetts and Arizona.
As a result, some insurance experts are saying there is another important issue: What will happen if companies like Aetna give up on auto insurance and others like State Farm balk at picking up this freed-up business?
"Long term, if insurers continue abandoning the market, the capacity simply won't be there to serve individuals," predicted Edward Young, a group vice president at Allstate.
State Farm, Allstate and Nationwide are among the leading direct writers, companies that sell policies directly to the public by mail, telephone, or a field sales force that works exclusively for that insurer. By contrast, independent-agency companies like Travelers, Cigna and the Hartford group sell through freelance brokers.
Because direct-writer companies pay sales commissions that are a fourth to a third less than those paid by independent agencies, they have been able to undercut the prices of the Aetnas of the world and gain market share. In 1985, according to A. M. Best, the direct writers took in 52.6 percent of auto-insurance premiums, with the agency companies' generating the remaining 47.4 percent. By the end of 1989, the direct writers' share of the market had grown to 56.3 percent. State Farm's share during this period rose to 16.9 percent from less than 15 percent.
"It does appear that the direct writers are positioned to take an even bigger portion of the personal lines of insurance," said Robin Campaniano, the insurance commissioner in Hawaii and the chairman of the personal-lines committee of the National Association of Insurance Commissioners.
This new business would normally be a bonanza for the direct writers, allowing them to streamline operations to reduce costs and to charge less. And a larger policyholder base generally yields actual results closer to what actuarial tables predict. In the insurance industry, this is known as the law of large numbers.
But in this case, executives industrywide say that to make sure the new business is not more trouble than it is worth, they are working overtime to try to minimize the losses that could result.
Their main approach so far has been to try to control internal expenses. Insurance companies say that with the costs of car repairs and hospitalization still climbing, holding down their own expenses may be the best way to control overall costs.
 
State Farm Prepares
 Nowhere is this more true than at State Farm. Benefiting from its lower sales commissions, State Farm's administrative costs for handling auto policies are already about a third less than the industry average. But to keep from losing ground if claims rise as expected, State Farm will have to widen that gap further. It is already cutting back on awards, trips and certain cash bonuses for employees. And new offices are built with an eye toward saving on costs.
"We are building functional offices, not palaces," said Mr. Rust, who became State Farm's chairman in 1987 and whose father, Edward B. Rust Sr., also headed the company.
State Farm is also trying to curry favor with its agents, apparently in the hope that happy agents are more likely to identify and root out bad risks.
State Farm's latest push is to hook up about 2,500 agents not already linked to State Farm's computer system. The system provides each agent with an up-to-date electronic record on policyholders, including policy provisions, claim histories and property inventories. This way, for example, the computer system might reveal that a motorist insured by State Farm might also need boat insurance.
But before long, the computer system's biggest benefit could be to help State Farm reduce its claims rate by prompting agents to obtain information that is sometimes overlooked but important to assess coverage and premium rates.
The question remains whether even State Farm's computers will prove to be enough to hold down or offset claims expenses. Many of the company's future expenses, like paying for car repairs and hospitalization of accident victims, will be out of the company's control. That makes it hard to say anything beyond that State Farm could end up being a big winner or a big loser.

HEADLINE: 4 Exchanges Spurn Moving To New Jersey

BYLINE: By RICHARD LEVINE

 BODY:
Spurning an offer to cross the Hudson to New Jersey, leaders of New York's commodities exchanges said yesterday that they would recommend that their new headquarters be built in lower Manhattan, home to the exchanges for more than a century.
To keep the exchanges, the hub of an industry that generates $1.3 billion a year in goods, services and salaries, New York City and the state offered what was described as an unprecedented array of incentives, including a construction grant of $82 million, tax and rent subsidies worth $56 million and energy savings of nearly $7 million. 
 The package would bring the exchanges' operating costs to a little less than $23 million a year in the early years of the 25-year deal, officials said. That is about $7 million less than under New York's initial offer but slightly higher than the exchanges' costs would have been if they moved to the Harborside Financial Center in Jersey City.
 
'The Deciding Factor'
 Still, exchange leaders said the higher costs of remaining in New York were offset by what they saw as the advantages of doing business in the city.
"The deciding factor is that New York is the financial capital of the world," said Martin Greenberg, chairman of the Commodity Exchange. "We belong here."
Yesterday's decision by the exchanges' chairmen requires approval by a majority of their boards and a majority of their members. If, as officials expect, the recommendation is adopted, construction could begin by 1992 at the site, bounded by Murray, Greenwich, Warren and West Streets. If not, the exchanges would remain where they are, at least for the time being.
Exchange officials had received final offers from New York and Jersey City last Thursday, analyzed them over the weekend and met from late Monday afternoon until 2 A.M. yesterday.
At one point, people close to the process said, the exchanges, which share a trading floor and had decided to relocate as a group, were split, with the New York Cotton Exchange and the New York Mercantile Exchange favoring moving and the Commodity Exchange and the Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange favoring staying in New York.
The New York Futures Exchange, in the same building as the others, has not made a formal commitment to move.
 
'Pretty Touch and Go"
 "Last night was pretty touch and go," said Vincent Tese, a former commodities trader who, as chairman of the State Urban Development Corporation, was credited with a crucial role in the negotiations.
The decision was a rare bit of encouragement for a city enduring its worst year economically since the late 1970's and for its Mayor, David N. Dinkins.
Before the Mayor arrived for the announcement at the exchanges' headquarters at 4 World Trade Center, he attended a meeting called by the New York City Partnership at the headquarters of The New York Times, where a group of city and state officials and business and civic leaders met with officials of Morgan Stanley, which, with 4,200 employees in New York, is also considering leaving the city.
The exchanges' decision was a setback for Mayor Gerald McCann of Jersey City. In in terviews over the last week, however, he confidently predicted that, with corporate profits under pressure and costs on his side of the Hudson so much lower, Jersey City would be more and more attractive to companies seeking to save money.
New Jersey's Commerce Commissioner, George R. Zoffinger, said, "We knew all along that the exchanges were really using New Jersey as leverage to get a better deal out of New York."
 
Extraordinary Incentives
 The incentives provided to the exchanges -- $95 million from the city and $43 million from the state -- were the most ever awarded for a relocation in Manhattan and involved an extraordinarily large grant, city officials said, though the deal was not as large as the one that accompanied the Chase Manhattan Bank's shifting of 5,000 back-office workers to Brooklyn, where tax abatements are higher to begin with.
The commodities exchanges employ 11,700 people, a figure expected to grow, and generate $84 million in city tax revenues and $80 million in state tax revenues annually.
Sally B. Hernandez-Pinero, the city's deputy mayor for finance and economic development, said the city and the state could recoup their investment in three and a half years.
Borough President Ruth W. Messinger of Manhattan, who has opposed some tax-incentive deals, said she liked this one. "The number of jobs, the time in the city's economic cycle and most importantly the fact that this is a tax break for an entire industry is what makes the difference," she said.
 
Tunnel Plan Dropped
 In 1985, the commodities exchanges negotiated a deal with the city to build a new headquarters atop the Manhattan entrance to the Brooklyn-Battery Tunnel, but the project was dropped after the stock market's plunge in 1987.
The Jersey City site would have allowed the exchanges to have a 100,000-square-foot trading floor. At the Manhattan site, a few blocks north of the Trade Center, the trading floor can only be as large as 75,000 square feet. But that is still three times the size of area traders must squeeze into now.
As traders streamed onto the floor at the start of business yesterday, the Mercantile Exchange chairman, Z. Lou Guttman, announced the decision over a public-address system, though his words were barely audible over the din.
Interviewed later, several brokers said they were relieved that they would finally be moving to bigger quarters.
"I think the reaction is very positive," said Robert Fink, a floor broker near the gold futures ring. "People are very happy to be staying in the city."

HEADLINE: MIDEAST TENSIONS;
Saudi Women Take Driver's Seat in a Rare Protest for the Right to Travel

BYLINE: By YOUSSEF M. IBRAHIM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: RIYADH, Saudi Arabia, Wednesday, Nov. 7

 BODY:
In daring defiance of the Saudi tradition against women driving, about 70 veiled Saudi women gathered on Tuesday in front of a supermarket in Riyadh, dismissed their drivers and drove in a convoy of cars before being stopped and and detained by the police a short time later.
Saudis said the demonstration for the right to drive was the first known open protest by Saudi women and an exceedingly rare manifestation of public sentiment in this conservative Islamic nation. 
 Equally startling was that virtually all of the women received the support of their husbands or close male relatives before undertaking the action, several organizers said.
 
Plush Sedans
 The cars -- about 40 dark, plush Lincoln Continentals, Mercedes-Benzes, Buicks and Japanese luxury sedans -- were intercepted by the Saudi police at intersections after the convoy had broken into smaller groups, about a half-hour after the protest began. Some of the women in the cars refused to lower their windows or communicate with the police before they were taken away.
Saudi officials said early this morning that the women had been released after signing a pledge that they would not repeat their action elsewhere.
The demonstration came at a time when the presence of American and other Western forces is stirring considerable debate here about whether to bring this country more in tune with the modern world. But many of the women involved in the demonstration were eager to emphasize that it had nothing to do with the large presence of Westerners here since the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait on Aug. 2. The protest was not publicized in advance to Western news organizations.
 
Barred by Tradition
 Although some Saudi women have pressed for a wider array of rights, organizers said the protest was focused narrowly on the right to drive as a matter of convenience and household economics.
Although there is no written law that prevents women from driving here, they are barred by tradition from doing so and must use a paid driver or a relative to go anywhere. Under severe Islamic strictures, Saudi women are veiled and robed from head to toe, forbidden from appearing in public with men and from traveling anywhere without permission from husbands or male relatives.
Organizers of the demonstration said many of the women had gotten driver's licenses while in the United States or Europe. They said that many were highly educated and came from prominent families, a factor that may have figured in their treatment by the authorities.
It was doubtful, however, that the Saudi authorities would react more harshly because the status of women here, while inferior to men, is also highly protected by tradition and paternalism.
 
No Official Mention
 The protest became the talk of this the country Tuesday evening, evidently through word of mouth. In phone interviews from places around the country, Saudis used words like "amazing" and "astounding" to describe the incident. There was no mention of it on any Saudi news reports, however, and many Saudis were certain that the Saudi authorities would suppress any information about it.
The organizers said they sent dozens of telegrams to senior Saudi officials explaining that their intention was for the greater good of Saudi Arabia.
The incident began late Tuesday afternoon with women, some accompanied by daughters, converging on the Al Tamimi Safeway supermarket parking lot, driven there by their chauffeurs. There, the drivers were left behind as some of the women got into the driver's seats and the rest occupied passenger seats. At least one woman's husband followed in another car from a distance -- for "moral support," he said.
 
'Couldn't Believe My Ears'
 "I couldn't believe my ears when madame asked me for the car keys and told me to get out and then drove away with the others," said a Sri Lankan driver who identified himself as T. R. Zein.
Another chauffeur, an Indonesian who said his name was Asmara, said his employer brought her 15-year-old daughter along and left the house while her husband was present and presumably informed about her intentions. "I think he knows," the Indonesian man said of the husband.
Mr. Zein, who sat on the sidewalk next with about 25 other, mostly Asian drivers, said he drove his employer, whom he described as a 35-year-old schoolteacher, along with her teen-age daughter.
"There were about 40 cars here and they left us all here," he said as other drivers nodded. "They drove together. I think the police caught them later."
 
'We Wanted to Be Heard'
 The Saudi religious police known as the Committee for Commendation of Virtue and Prevention of Vice rounded up all of the cars and the women at intersections. They prevented curious onlookers from approaching an area where they were stopped on King Abdel Aziz Road.
The police could be seen asking women to get out from driver's seats and to sit in back seats, as more police cars converged on one site where the women's cars were stopped.
The women were deliberately trying to draw attention and fully expected to be arrested, one of the organizers said. "We wanted to be heard by the authorities, loudly and clearly," she said in a telephone interview a few hours later.
Later, in separate telephone interviews, two of the women who helped organize the demonstration and who insisted on not being identified explained that they spent a week planning the event.
They all agreed that a leading figure behind the protest was Aisha al-Maneh, a sociology professor who received her doctorate from the University of Colorado in Boulder. They described her as an outspoken advocate among hundreds of other educated women in Saudi Arabia who have argued that there were no edicts in Islam that ban women from driving.
 
'Patriotic' Protest
 Mrs. Aisha, who taught for some time at the university here before she reportedly quit in frustration over other restrictions imposed on women, could not be reached for comment.
The two women who participated in the organization of the demonstration said they meant no harm to Saudi Arabia and strongly defended their action as "patriotic" and "necessary."
"It is important for the authorities to understand that as educated women who have driven themselves abroad while we pursued graduate studies, we cannot be reduced to being dependent on strangers to drive us," said a 36-year-old woman who asked not to be identified by name.
"In addition to being humiliating, this is anti-Islamic," she said. "Islam says that a woman should not be left alone in the company of a man who is not her relative and that is exactly what happens everytime I am driven in my car by a Pakistani, Sudanese or other person who is a driver. Besides, this is very expensive on our family budget."
Such complaints have been heard many times here and are openly discussed on Saudi television programs, but they have failed so far to bring about change.
 
'Supporting Islam'
 "We wanted to send the message with this drastic action we were forced to undertake that we are not breaking the rules of Islam, but supporting Islam," one protester said. "All those who participated today were veiled and accompanied by other women. They drove slowly and well. They did not break any laws."
The participants said they would repeat their actions again.
Several senior Saudi officials interviewed Tuesday night said they supported the women's goals, although they took exception with the protest itself.
"We have been debating this issue for quite some time and some of the most senior people in the country are in favor of allowing women to drive for perfectly handsome reasons," said a senior official who asked not to be identified. "But in our country everything happens through evolution, not revolution."
It was significant that the demonstration took place in Riyadh, which is the heart of the conservative religious establishment.
Najd, the region in which Riyadh lies, is largely populated by the descendants of the inner tribal desert Bedouins. Geographically isolated, it has been the region most resistant to the gradual modernization urged by the Saudi Government and the royal family.
By contrast, Jidda, a Red Sea port that lies in the region known as Hijaz, has been the most liberal city because of its exposure to travelers and foreigners. Saudi women can be seen there walking without their faces veiled and frequenting public restaurants in the company of their husbands, something that rarely occurs here.

HEADLINE: THE 1990 ELECTIONS: The Implications;
Much Ventured, for Little

BYLINE: By R. W. APPLE Jr.

 BODY:
Like many a President before him, George Bush proved unable to move the political heavens on Tuesday.
Hoping to point his party toward a brighter future in the 1990's, he poured his energy into a prodigious effort to elect Republican governors in the three Sun Belt behemoths -- Florida, Texas and California -- each of which will gain new seats in the House of Representatives because of redistricting. He failed in Florida, failed even more dramatically in his adopted home state of Texas, and went to bed unsure about the outcome of the close contest in California. 
 At best, then, one out of three -- not much to show for a lot of hard work in the Southern and Western states where the future of American politics will clearly unfold, just as it unfolded 50 years ago in New York and Pennsylvania and Illinois.
 
A Message on Taxes
 Elsewhere, the electorate sent a message that President Bush once transmitted as his own: No new taxes. Most Republican strategists believed from the start that Mr. Bush made a mistake by abandoning his pledge and sowing confusion within his party, and so it proved as the returns poured in.
In New Jersey, for example, voters were positively apoplectic with rage about the tax increases imposed by Gov. Jim Florio, but they could not vote against Mr. Florio, whose name was not on the ballot. So the Governor's fellow Democrat, the usually popular Senator Bill Bradley, was very nearly defeated by a little-known opponent who raised only 4 percent as much money as he did.
Every New England state except Maine got a new governor as the region, gripped by recession, struggles to find adequate governmental revenue.
 
Surprise for Gingrich
 Representative Newt Gingrich of Georgia, a Republican who broke with Mr. Bush to lead a revolt against the budget accord reached two weeks ago, was locked in a totally unexpected life-and-death struggle, and Representative Peter Smith of Vermont, another Republican who bravely supported the plan but then distanced himself from Mr. Bush, lost his seat.
But a tax rollback in Massachusetts was decisively defeated.
In a day of balloting characterized more by cross-currents than by tidal waves, a day when trends were difficult to discern, voter resentment proved to be less potent than expected. Many were frightened, but few were defeated. The political thunder rolled and the electoral lightning crackled on Tuesday night; first Mr. Bradley and then Senator Jesse Helms of North Carolina, the Republican arch-conservative, seemed headed for defeat, but each of them finally managed to pull out a victory.
When the storm had cleared, relatively little had changed on Capitol Hill, as the magical potions of incumbency -- money and name recognition and services rendered for constituents great and small -- did their work again.
 
No Movement in Senate
 With only the Minnesota contest remaining to be decided, not a single Senate seat had moved from one party to the other, and it appeared possible that for the first time since World War II every Senate incumbent seeking relection would manage to achieve it.
A few House members lost, mostly because of local circumstance: Roy Dyson, a Maryland Democrat, because of links to Pentagon produrement scandals; and Stan Parris, a Virginia Republican, partly because of his views on abortion; and John Hiler, an Indiana Republican, who also has close races and finally ran out of luck; and Bill Grant, a Florida Republican who switched parties and offended his constituents.
The most astonishing reversal came in the distrcit centered on the longtime liberal stronghold of Madison, Wis., where Representative Robert W. Kastenmeier, a 16-term Democratic incumbent, tied for 11th in seniority in the House, was ousted by a former television news reporter, Scott L. Klug. Mr. Klug described the 66-year-old Mr. Kastenmeier, whose seat was once held by Robert LaFolette, as "torn, worn and outdated."
In Oregon, Representative Denny Smith, a Republican with ties to the savings and loan scandals, went down to defeat, but another politician tarred with that brush, Representative Frank Annunzio, Democrat of Illinois, survived.
Others seats seemed likely to change, including several in California, perhaps, and one in Minnesota, where a sex scandal turned politics upside down.
 
A Weak Starting Position
 In an average midterm election, the party holding the White House loses 28 seats, and it seemed highly unlikely that Mr. Bush would do that badly. But he had relatively few seats to lose; no President in history has ever taken office with his party holding as weak a position in the House. And the losses he did suffer, perhaps as many as 10 seats net, presented him with the prospect of an even stronger Democratic opposition on Capitol Hill.
A change of that size could make it harder for Mr. Bush to govern. The recent employment discrimination bill, for example, passed the House by a margin of 273 to 154, which was 17 short of the margin needed to override the President's veto. The changes on Tuesday would put the Democrats within reach of a "veto-proof" margin in the House.
But it was governors of both parties, buffeted by the beginnings of a recession, closer to the voters than Washington lawmakers, who had the hardest time of all.
Democrats took statehouses away from Republicans in several parts of the country, from Florida to Kansas to Rhode Island, although in the Midwest, the Republicans ran strongly in states like Michigan and Ohio where Democrats had controlled statehouses for considerable periods.
It was a trade much to the benefit of the Democrats, who will now be in a position to draw the new lines of power to suit themselves in four of the five largest states -- New York, Texas, Florida and Pennsylvania -- and perhaps even in California, the grand prize.

HEADLINE: THE 1990 ELECTIONS: Congress;
Helms and Other Incumbents Manage to Hold On

BYLINE: By ROBIN TONER

 BODY:
In a day of dramatic struggle and unexpected twists, Senator Jesse Helms prevailed over his Democratic opponent, Harvey Gantt in North Carolina yesterday, while Senator Bill Bradley beat back a surprisingly powerful challenge from Christine Todd Whitman, a Republican, in New Jersey.
Mr. Helms, the 18-year incumbent and conservative firebrand, declared gleefully last night, "The mighty ultraliberal establishment struck out." Mr. Gantt, the first black Mayor of Charlotte, whose underdog campaign for the Senate drew worldwide attention, said, "I do not regret a single day of this campaign." 
 With 91 percent of the vote counted in North Carolina, Mr. Helms had 54 percent to Mr. Gantt's 46 percent.
 
Struggle for Political Life
 In New Jersey, Mr. Bradley, widely considered a likely Democratic Presidential contender in 1992, spent Election Day struggling for his political life against an opponent who was not expected to pose much of a threat. With 99 percent of the vote counted, he had 52 percent to Ms. Whitman's 48 percent.
These results came as incumbents generally managed to hold on against an angry electorate who, in many areas, clearly wanted to send a message. In Massachusetts, Senator John Kerry, a Democrat, turned back a challenge from Jim Rappaport, a businessman, that had deeply worried many Democrats in this autumn of discontent. In Kentucky, Senator Mitch McConnell, a Republican, claimed victory over his challenger, Harvey Sloane, after complaining that from news accounts, "you'd have thought every incumbent had horns."
One incumbent in serious trouble was Senator Rudy Boschwitz, Republican of Minnesota, who has served in the Senate since 1978. His opponent, Paul Wellstone, a political science professor dismissed by many political insiders, claimed victory last night. But with less than half the votes counted, only two percentage points separated the two candidates.
It appeared that all the other Senate incumbents would survive. And while there were some upsets in the House, including the defeat of a 32-year veteran, Representative Robert W. Kastenmeier, Democrat of Wisconsin, most members won re-election.
Still, the volatile electorate made itself felt in many areas, with Representative Newt Gingrich, the second-ranking Republican in the House, suddenly confronted with a battle for political survival in his suburban Atlanta district. Mr. Gingrich openly feuded with the White House in the recent budget negotiations.
Democrats, confident of a solid majority for the next two years, voiced a new assertiveness toward President Bush.
 
'Must Come to Congress'
 Representative Richard A. Gephardt, the House majority leader, said last night: "The results are very clear: George Bush could not win the Congress, and he can no longer rule by veto. Next year, he must come to the Congress with an action plan for reviving this economy and reworking the system to the benefit of working families."
Continuing the pattern of midterm elections, Democrats expected to add to their already hefty 258-to-175 majority in the House. At the same time, several Democratic senators who were targets for the Republicans earlier this year, including Senator Claiborne Pell of Rhode Island and Senator Paul Simon of Illinois, handily turned back those challenges. Senator Carl Levin, Democrat of Michigan, prevailed over Representative Bill Schuette, and Senator Tom Harkin, Democrat of Iowa, defeated Representative Tom Tauke, a Republican.
In one of the closest races this fall, Senator Daniel K. Akaka, a Democrat, turned back a strong challenge from Representative Patricia Saiki, the Republican thought to have the best chance of wresting a seat from the Democrats.
Democrats, who have controlled the House since 1954, won at least four seats from the Republicans, and probably more. In Virginia, Stan Parris, a Republican, was handily defeated, while in Florida, Bill Grant, a Democrat turned Republican, also lost. Moreover, the threat to Mr. Gingrich, one of the most militant conservatives and a longtime spokesman for the young turks of the Republican Party, was certain to drive jolts through the ranks of House Republicans.
But Democrats did not emerge unscathed. Roy Dyson, a five-term Democrat from Maryland, went down in defeat. His office had been embroiled in ethical controversies.
Voters were electing 34 senators and 435 House members yesterday, although many of the contests were mere technicalities. In the Senate, the political struggle came down to a handful of states in the final weeks of the campaign, including North Carolina, Hawaii, Iowa, Kentucky, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Oregon and Rhode Island.
Democrats began the election season with hopes of maintaining their 55-to-45 margin in the Senate. Republicans began with high hopes of chipping away at it, in preparation for an all-out assault on Democratic control of the Senate in 1992. Democrats have 20 members up for re-election in that Presidential election year, while Republicans have only 14.
 
Unexpected Game of Defense
 But Republicans found themselves playing an unexpected game of defense this autumn. Democrats used the budget negotiations and President Bush's repeated reversals on the issue of taxes to portray the Republicans as the tribunes of the rich.
Some of the most senior Republicans found themselves struggling against the year's angry, anti-incumbent mood. Senator Mark O. Hatfield of Oregon, a 24-year-veteran of the Senate, survived a stiff challenge from the businessman and scientist Harry Lonsdale.
Mr. Gantt's challenge to Mr. Helms became far more competitive than many political insiders expected. Only three blacks have served in the United States Senate, all of them Republicans. Edward W. Brooke of Massachusetts was the only black to serve since Reconstruction.
Several senior incumbents were returned to office with little or no strain, including Senator Sam Nunn, the Georgia Democrat who heads the Senate Armed Services Committee; Senator Strom Thurmond, the 87-year-old South Carolina Republican; Senator John W. Warner, Republican of Virginia; Senator Thad Cochran, Republican of Mississippi, and Senator David Pryor, Democrat of Arkansas.
Also re-elected handily were Senators Al Gore of Tennessee, John D. Rockefeller 4th of West Virginia and Joseph R. Biden Jr. of Delaware, all Democrats. Senator Howell Heflin, an Alabama Democrat considered vulnerable by some Republicans early on, was also returned to Washington.
Senator J. Bennett Johnston, a Democrat, won his seat in Lousiana's unusual open primary earlier this year, turning back an unexpectedly strong challenge from David Duke, a former leader of the Ku Klux Klan.
The House of Representatives has seemed largely immune to the anti-incumbent mood regularly registered in public opinion polls this year. Over the last two election cycles, the re-election rate in the House was 98 percent; the last time it dropped below 90 percent was 1974. Incumbents have enormous advantages in the House, from fund raising to the perquisites of office. Moreover, both national parties have focused their attention on 1992, when redistricting and retirements are expected to open as many as 80 seats in the House.

HEADLINE: THE 1990 ELECTIONS: The Nation;
DEMOCRATS RETAIN GRIP ON CONGRESS, TAKE TOP POSTS IN TEXAS AND FLORIDA; CUOMO RE-ELECTED, BRADLEY SURVIVES

BYLINE: By MICHAEL ORESKES

 BODY:
Democrats captured the governorships of two Sun Belt states that will play key roles in the battle over reapportionment, while retaining their strong hold on the Congress yesterday in midterm elections.
Despite furious last-minute efforts by President Bush to rally Republican support, Ann Richards, the liberal State Treasurer, was elected governor of Texas, and Lawton Chiles, the former Senator, was elected governor of Florida. 
 The victories gave Democrats two of the three biggest prizes of 1990, with the battle for the governorship of California still unresolved early today.
Ms. Richards defeated Clayton Williams, whose intemperate remarks alienated many moderate Republicans. Mr. Chiles tapped a vein of voter anger to unseat Gov. Bob Martinez, who was trying to become the first Republican ever to win re-election as governor of Florida.
 
Cuomo, Bradley, Weicker Win
 Voter discontent was apparent around the country in narrower-than- expected victories for many prominent candidates, including two of the Democratic Party's top national prospects, Gov. Mario M. Cuomo of New York and Senator Bill Bradley of New Jersey.
Voter resentment was also at work in Connecticut, where Lowell P. Weicker, the former Republican Senator ousted in 1988 and now running as an independent, was elected governor in a campaign which attacked both political parties. He became the first independent elected governor of an American state since the Watergate-inspired voter rebellion of 1974.
In Massachusetts, anxiety and anger over taxes and the sagging economy overwhelmed other issues. But John R. Silber, the Democratic candidate for governor, fell just short in his attempt to ride that wave of anger. He conceded early today to the Republican, William F. Weld.
 
Fitting a Pattern
 Mr. Weld's victory fit a national pattern in contests for governor in which voters turned to whichever party had not been in power in the last few years of economic stress and tax increases. Gov. Michael S. Dukakis of Massachusetts has been increasingly unpopular as the economy has worsened.
Senator Bradley survived an unexpectedly tight race against the Republican, Christine Todd Whitman, as voters took out on Mr. Bradley their anger at another Democrat, Gov. Jim Florio, who sponsored the biggest tax increase in state history.
One of the hardest-fought races in the country was the battle for the Senate in North Carolina. Election Day began with the Republican incumbent, Senator Jesse Helms, chastising reporters at his polling place and ended with Mr. Helms claiming victory over his Democratic opponent, Harvey Gantt, the former Mayor of Charlotte.
The Republican Governor of Rhode Island, Edward DiPrete, whose standing was hurt by tax increases and a corruption scandal, was defeated by the Democrat, Bruce Sundlun, a wealthy businessman.
 
Fights in Middle West
 While Democrats were making gains in the Sun Belt, Republicans were in fierce races from the Northeast and throughout the "rust belt."
Gov. Rudy Perpich of Minnesota, a Democrat, was in a virtual dead heat with Arne Carlson, a Republican who entered the race only last week after the original Republican nominee dropped out after disclosures he had once swum in the nude with his daughters' teen-age friends.
In Illinois, where Gov. Jim Thompson, a Republican, is retiring, Jim Edgar, the Republican candidate, narrowly beat Neil Hartigan, the Democrat.
Terry Branstad, the Republican Governor of Iowa, was easily re-elected despite an effort to rally supporters of legal access to abortion against him.
 
Referendum on Bush?
 The first elections of the 1990's were watched as a possible referendum on Mr. Bush and on issues such as abortion and race.
The Republican defeats were blows for President Bush, reflecting a trend that politicians say began to build in recent weeks as concern about recession deepened and Mr. Bush dropped his long stand against new taxes in pursuit of a defecit-reduction deal.
Even as returns rolled in from Eastern states, voters in the West were continuing to vote in some of the biggest and most closely fought races -- for governor of California and for the Senate in Oregon and Hawaii.
"We're very encouraged by Democratic vote all over the country," said Howard Schloss, spokesman for the Democratic Congressional Campaign.
President Bush voted yesterday morning in Houston, after a weekend of campaigning for the Republican candidate for governor, Mr. Williams.
 
Big Stakes in Florida
 Florida was a crucial prize, one of the nation's biggest and fastest-growing states. Florida will probably gain four Congressional seats after reapportionment next year, and Mr. Chiles's victory means that the new political map in the state will be drawn entirely by Democrats, who control both houses of the state Legislature.
Mr. Chiles ran a strong campaign as a political outsider despite his 18 years in the United States Senate, which he left in 1988, saying he was burned out.
Mr. Martinez had two big problems: the political damage done by tax increases he supported and an ill-fated legislative session that rejected Mr. Martinez's proposal to restrict abortion.
Abortion was an important issue aiding Mr. Chiles, who supports legal access to abortion. But his media consultant, Frank Greer, emphasized Mr. Chiles's "anti-politician" appeal.
"We were outspent five to one. but Lawton Chiles had a very clear message," Mr. Greer said. "That he was running against politics as usual, that he was running for change, that he was limiting contributions to keep special-interest money out of politics and that he was running a positive campaign."
 
Voinovich Wins in Ohio
 Democrats also picked up Republican-held governorships in Oklahoma and Kansas. But in Ohio, where Gov. Richard F. Celeste, a Democrat, is stepping down, George Voinovich, the Republican, defeated Anthony Celebrezze.
Mr. Voinovich, the former Mayor of Cleveland, ran well ahead of the usual Republican performance in Cleveland, normally a Democratic stronghold. Mr. Celebrezze had hoped to make an abortion a key issue, abandoning his opposition to legal abortion at the start of the campaign. But Mr. Voinovich painted him as a waffler and tried to assure Ohio voters he did not plan to impose his personal opposition to abortion on the state.
Elsewhere in the Middle West, Gov. James Blanchard of Michigan, a Democrat, was in a race so tight that he predicted the outcome would not be known until absentee ballots were counted. His opponent is John Engler, Republican leader of the State Senate.
 
Turned Out in Kansas
 In Kansas, Gov. Mike Hayden, a Republican who has been blamed for large property tax increases, was defeated by State Treasuerer Joan Finney, a Democrat who will become the state's first woman governor.
Senator Don Nickles, chairman of the Republican Senatorial Campaign Committee, said Republican hopes for a stronger showing this year had been set back in recent weeks. "The budget debacle was pretty hard on us," he said.
But nothing more dramatically illustrated the anger of voters than the race one Democrat, Senator Bradley of New Jersey, found himself in against Ms. Whitman, whom he outspent by 12 to 1.
Mr. Bradley had expected to coast to victory, but was caught in the furor created when Governor Florio pushed through the big tax increase.
Despite repeated demands from Ms. Whitman, who was viewed as a sacrificial lamb by most New Jersey politicians six months ago, Mr. Bradley refused to take a stand on the tax increases, asserting that it was a state issue.The polls in New Jersey suggested that some voters were voting against Mr. Bradley as a surrogate for Mr. Florio. Supporters of Ms. Whitman said that taxes was the issue.
 
Race Was a Factor
 Among voters leaving the polls in North Carolina, nearly three in 10 of Mr. Helms's voters said race was a factor, and just over two in 10 of Mr. Gantt's supporters said it was. Whites were slightly more likely than blacks to say race was a factor in their vote.
Much of the Massachusetts contest for governor had centered on a debate over a tax-cutting initiative which would have rolled back more than a year of tax increases. Mr. Weld supported it, while Dr. Silber opposed it as an extreme measure which, he said, would wreck state services and cause a "meltdown" of the economy.
A significant number of voters accepted Dr. Silber's view of the tax measure, voting against the initative but then voting for Mr. Weld.
Dr. Silber, whose image as an angry outsider carried him to victory in the Democratic primary, was hurt in the general election campaign by more of his "Silber Shockers," including a suggestion that women who put their children in day care could be perpetrating child abuse. A television interview in which Dr. Silber pounced, figuratively and almost literally, on a well-known Boston television anchorwoman, was replayed repeatedly by Mr. Weld's campaign.
"Our campaign was not just about winning votes," Dr. Silber said. "We stood for the proposition that politics was about straight talk, about common sense."
 
Running on Anger
 Asked what were the most important factors in their vote, Mr. Weld's supporters cited their desire for change and their perception that Dr. Silber was too extreme. One Democratic analyst said that Dr. Silber, having won the primary on anger, continued to campaign on it, rather than moving to the political center and moderating his harsh image. Dr. Silber's supporters cited what they saw as his honesty and leadership quality.
A significant number of voters who supported Dr. Silber in the Democratic primary as a protest against the Democratic establishment in Massachusetts abandoned him when their vote would actually have made him governor. More than one out of 10 of Mr. Weld's supporters said they had voted for Dr. Silber in the Democratic primary.
 
'Elect This Dress'
 Among voters surveyed outside polling places in California, men favored Senator Pete Wilson, the Republican, while Dianne Feinstein, the Democrat whose final appeal included a call to "elect this dress," won a majority of women in the race for governor.
Supports of Ms. Feinstein, the former Mayor of San Francisco, cited the environment most often as the issue which mattered most in their vote. Among Mr. Wilsons' supporters, the issues that mattered most were crime and drugs.
In Texas, Mr. Williams, a millionaire businessman with interests in oil, cattle and banking, was hurt among voters who considered ethics an important issue. He was favored among voters who viewed crime and drugs as key issues.
The Texas race was probably the nastiest in the nation this year. Both candidates succeeded in hurting the other's image badly. The last pre-election poll, for The Houston Chronicle, found that a majority of voters had a negative opinion of both candidates.
Voters leaving the polls were divided over who had been the more negative in the campaign, with about one in four citing Ms. Richards, one in four citing Mr. Williams and one in four saying they were both the same.

HEADLINE: The 1990 Elections: Governor - Texas;
Fierce Election for Governor Is Narrowly Won by Richards

BYLINE: By ROBERTO SURO, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: AUSTIN, Tex., Nov. 6

 BODY:
Sounding the populist themes tonight that carried her to a fiercely fought victory in the Texas governor's race, Ann Richards, the Democratic candidate, invited her supporters to join her in a march to the State Capitol and proclaimed, "We're going to take back the Capitol for the people of Texas."
With more than 80 percent of the vote counted, Ms. Richards, the State Treasurer, led with 52 percent of the vote to 48 percent for her Republican opponent, Clayton Williams. 
 Mr. Williams conceded defeat in an appearance before his supporters, who booed repeatedly when he offered his congratulations to Ms. Richards.
 
A Winning Coalition
 In one of the closest elections in recent Texas history Ms. Richards put together a winning coalition of women and minority voters, according to a survey conducted at polling places around the state today.
Acknowledging these consituencies as she claimed visctory, Ms. Richards held up a T-shirt that bore a picture of the State Capitol building and the slogan, "A woman's place is in the dome."
In her victory speech she said that the people of Texas had announced today that "they want a governor that remembers that this state is principally made up of working people who live from paycheck to paycheck."
Mr. Williams appears to have been seriously damaged by a number of gaffes. In March he joked that the only thing to do about rape or bad weather was to "relax and enjoy it." That remark apparently alienated a large number of women voters, and Mr. Williams said tonight that one lesson he had learned from the campaign was "not to joke about the weather."
In a New York Times/CBS News Poll, conducted by Voter Research and Surveys, Ms. Richards was favored by 6 female voters of 10. Among men, Mr. Williams was favored by just over half of those surveyed.
 
The Vote Tally
 With more than 80 percent of the vote counted, the vote was:
 
Richards . . . 1,583,204 (52%)
Williams . . . 1,463,261 (48%)
 Returns showed that Ms. Richards was holding traditional Democratic strongholds in East and South Texas while running surprisingly strong in the major cities, including Dallas, usually a stronghold for Republican candidates.
A 57-year-old, white-haired grandmother, Ms. Richards relentlessly attacked Mr. Williams for his cowboy image, his lack of governmental experience and his privileged status as a multimillionaire. Even as she claimed her victory, Ms. Richards emphasized these points. She said that the people of Texas "want a governor that gets up and goes to work in the morning. They want a governor that isn't distracted by other business."
By contrast, Ms. Richards campaigned on populist and economic themes, focusing much of her effort on a program to bring down insurance rates and to favor consumers over corporate interests.
Mr. Williams, a West Texas oil man, spent twice as much on the campaign as did Ms. Richards, including $8 million of his own money. Throughout the summer and early fall he led in the polls by substantial margins, but the race began to tighten in the last three weeks.
Support for the two candidates was sharply split along racial and ethnic lines, according to the poll of voters conducted today by Voter Research and Surveys.
 
Whites Voted Republican
 Mr. Williams apparently carried a substantial majority of the white vote, which makes up about 70 percent of the total. In the exit poll, well more than half of the whites surveyed said they had voted for Mr. Williams.
But Ms. Richards overwhelmingly carried the historically Democratic minority vote. In the poll, Ms. Richards was favored by 9 black voters of 10 surveyed. She took two-thirds of the Hispanic vote even though Mr. Williams, who speaks Spanish, campaigned extensively in Hispanic areas.
Ms. Richards, a speaker known for her sharp tongue and quick wit, repeatedly slashed at Mr. Williams, asserting that he had engaged in unethical business dealings and that he was a captive of corporate interests.

HEADLINE: The 1990 Election: Nonvoters;
Turned Off by Campaigns, Or Just Too Busy to Vote

BYLINE: By ROBIN TONER

 BODY:
Stephen Smith, a 22-year-old garbage collector in Utica, Mich., is tired of watching candidates "cutting each other down." He liked Ronald Reagan, but looks at the current crop of politicians and says, "You don't know who to believe."
He could try to vote them out, he acknowledges, but: "Who am I voting in? I'm voting another bum in." So Mr. Smith is not voting at all. 
 Nonvoters account for the real majority in a midterm election. In 1986, just 36.4 percent of the voting-age population went to the polls, the lowest turnout since 1942. The Committee for the Study of the American Electorate, a Washington study group, predicted that yesterday's turnout could be just as low.
Few questions are as fiercely debated among political experts as why so many Americans do not vote. Some analysts point to institutional barriers, like the procedures for registering to vote. Some blame the nature of modern American campaigns, arguing that a season of slashing television commercials offers little incentive to go to the polls. And some blame a broader breakdown in the nation's civic culture, a sense among many Americans that politics has little to do with their lives.
 
Turned Off by Politics
 A New York Times/CBS News Poll suggested that all these elements, and others, helped shape the nonvoting electorate. The poll, conducted Oct. 28-31, was based on telephone interviews with 1,445 adults nationwide and had an overall margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points.
In follow-up interviews with those adults and in conversations with other people on Election Day, many nonvoters seemed dismayed by campaigns and turned off by politics. They often voiced feelings of powerlessness, a sense that their ballot would make little difference on the issues they cared about. And they often cited more everyday concerns, saying they were too busy to vote, had forgotten to register or were worried that voting would translate into jury duty.
The explanations were often simple. "I believe voting is important, but I just haven't had time to register," said Ervin Harvey of Seattle.
But the explanations were often more complex.
Tony Bowe, a 37-year-old house painter from Rhinebeck, N.Y., said he cared about voting but simply felt overwhelmed. "With these politicians, I don't know who I'd vote for," he said. "I've heard ads for one judge bad-mouthing the other. Then, a little later, the other gets on with his spiel, knocking the first guy. I don't know who to trust.
"I have to judge who comes across the best on radio or television. And I don't know enough to figure out what is the truth. I kind of throw my hands up in the air and say that there's no hope."
 
'Vote for Nobody'
 Survey after survey has shown the American public in an angry, cynical mood this year, giving rise to predictions that incumbents were in for a rough time on Election Day. But interviews with nonvoters suggested that much of that anger might be expressed another way -- by simply staying home.
In Houston yesterday, for instance, a pickup truck bore a large hand-lettered sign: "Silent Revolt: Vote for Nobody."
Many nonvoters said they simply did not believe that replacing one set of politicians with another would make much difference.
"You could take all the politicians, put them all in a hat, shake it up and it would come out the same," said Homer J. Lewis, a retired salesman in Orlando, Fla.
Ethel H. Bolte, a retiree in Westchester, Ohio, said that this would be the first election she could remember when she did not plan to vote. "It won't make a difference anyway," she said. "They've all disappointed me too many times."
Mrs. Bolte suggested that she had simply lost faith. "I don't think things are any different; it's just that I'm wiser," said the 70-year-old longtime Republican. "They're all just concerned with their own parties."
 
Cynicism Toward Government
 Still, the New York Times/CBS News survey indicated that nonvoters were no more cynical toward government than the people considered likely to vote. For example, 77 percent of the likely voters said government was run by a few big interests looking out for themselves, while 76 percent of the nonvoters felt that way. But the survey did find that nonvoters tended to feel more powerless: 47 percent of the expected nonvoters said that "things would go on as before no matter who is elected," while 37 percent of the likely voters felt that way.
This theme was strong among many nonvoters who expressed concern about a variety of issues, but did not see voting as a way of acting on that concern.
Elizabeth T. Lee of West Covina, Calif., said she worried about the environment but does not think that voting can do much to protect it. "No one has been able to stop the polluting," said the 35-year-old housekeeper. "I don't think my vote is going to stop them. It's too big for me."
James E. Glasker Jr. of Murray, Utah, a 44-year-old supervisor at a copper smelting plant, said he thought "things were getting worse" and "poor and middle-class workers" were "going down the tube."
But he added: "It doesn't seem that voting matters. It seems that it's the money groups that win. There hasn't been an encouraging race for years."
The tenor of the modern campaign seemed to do little to encourage many of the nonvoters interviewed. "I can remember when it wasn't this bad," said Barbara Nagy of Stephens City, Va., a 51-year-old show dog breeder. "Maybe they'd have a debate. But anymore, it seems like they're hunting dirt on the other guy -- that's all they're doing.
"Instead of saying, 'This is where I stand and this is what I'll do,' it's 'The other guy is dirty so you should vote for me.' "
Interviews suggested that nonvoters were particularly turned off in Texas, scene of one of the roughest races of the year, the battle for governor between Ann Richards, a Democrat, and Clayton Williams.
 
'This Isn't Politics'
 "I'm not going to vote beause there's too much flimflam going on," said Charlie Randle, 29, a building engineer for Harris County in Houston. "This isn't politics; this is a dogfight. If people don't vote, the politicians might wake up the day after the election and ask, 'What did we do wrong?' "
Fred Guinn, a 50-year-old police officer in Virginia Beach, Va., said simply, "All it is is mudslinging."
Like most other research on the issue, the New York Times/CBS News Poll found that the nonvoting public tends to be younger, more mobile, less likely to have attended college and more likely to have an annual income under $30,000 than the voting population. Thirty-nine percent of the nonvoting group were under 30, as against just 16 percent of the voting group.
The poll estimated the likely voting public and the likely nonvoting public from their answers to questions about registration, past voting history and intention to vote.
Nathan K. Goodrich, an 18-year-old electrician living in Las Vegas, Nev., seemed genuinely distressed that he had not registered to vote but said: "People my age probably aren't registered because no one tells you what to do. I have no idea what the process is."
The Government spells out the procedures to register for the draft, he said, and added: "Selective Services sends a card and says that you have to do this. If the Government sent you a card and said that you had to register to vote, a lot more kids would be registered."
But many scholars of American voting say there are deeper forces at work. In the 19th century, "politics became a kind of social activity as well as political activity," said Paul Kleppner, director of the Social Science Research Institute at Northern Illinois University and author of "Who Voted." "It was deeply embedded in everyday life."
In contrast, many of the people interviewed after the New York Times/ CBS News survey talked of politics and politicians as distant and disconnected from their lives. "I've seen some of the candidates on television but it hasn't interested me," said Jenny Dorius, 21, of Salt Lake City. "My kids are more on my mind than voting."

ILLINOIS
Senator Paul Simon easily defeated Lynn Martin, a Republican Congresswoman who once had high hopes of an upset.
In a tight gubernatorial race, Neil Hartigan, a Democrat who promised tax cuts, battled James Edgar, a Republican who emphasized the need for money for better schools. Mr. Hartigan is the State Attorney General and was a two-term Lieutenant Governor, while Mr. Edgar, the Illinois Secretary of State, is a former state legislator and aide to Gov. James R. Thompson, who is retiring.
Representative Frank Annunzio, a 75-year old Democrat who is a senior member of the Banking Committee, won his 14th term, fighting off a challenge from Walter W. Dudycz, 40, a Republican State Senator who portrayed Mr. Annunzio as a lax regulator who ignored wrongdoing. Mr. Annunzio said he had been working to bring to justice those who looted the savings and loans.
In the 16th District, John Cox, a county prosecutor, faced State Representative John Hallock, a Republican.
 
 INDIANA
Although it appeared for a time as if the Democrat, Baron Hill, would mount a serious challenge to Senator Daniel R. Coats, the incumbent battled back with commercials that raised questions about Mr. Hill's consistency in opposing new taxes.
Representative Jill Long of Fort Wayne, a Democrat who won Mr. Coats's seat in the House, was challenged by a television evangelist, Rick Hawks. He attacked the incumbent as a big-spending liberal; she retorted that she had consistently opposed new taxes.
Representative John Hiler of the South Bend area, a Republican, faced Timothy J. Roemer, a former aide to Senator Dennis DeConcini of Arizona. Mr. Roemer tried to link Mr. Hiler to the savings and loan crisis: the Republican sits on the House Banking Committee, which oversees the industry. But Mr. Roemer's former boss, Senator DeConcini, has been linked to the scandal as well.
 
 IOWA
 Tom Harkin, a Democrat, met the difficult challenge of being re-elected Senator in Iowa; six years ago Mr. Harkin ousted the Republican incumbent, Roger Jepsen, who himself had ousted the Democratic incumbent six years previously.
 Mr. Harkin spent more than $5.5 million in a successful bid to blunt the campaign of Tom Tauke, a six-term Rep resentative from the "Field of Dreams" country of northeastern Iowa. Mr. Tauke said the incumbent backed liberal spending policies, abused mailing privileges and spent too much time outside Iowa.
Gov. Terry Branstad, a Republican seeking a third term, defeated Donald Avenson, Speaker of the State House.
 
 KANSAS
Gov. Mike Hayden, a Republican, lost to Joan Finney, who has spent the last 16 of her 65 years as State Treasurer. As in the Democratic primary, Ms. Finney stormed from far behind in the polls, making much of the Governor's tax changes, which hit small businesses and homeowners hard.
Kansas' junior Senator, Nancy Landon Kassebaum, a Republican, reconsidered her promise to serve only two terms, and her resulting campaign had history on its side. For one thing, Kansas last elected a Democrat to the Senate in 1932. For another, she faced Dick Williams, who backed into the race when the primary winner, Bill Roy Sr., declined his victory, citing fatigue. She won.
 
MINNESOTA
Minnesota proved to be one state where the heralded anti-incumbent mood took hold. State politics, once as homespun as the fictional Lake Wobegon, turned melodramatic as Peyton Place this year.
The Democratic Senatorial candidate, Paul Wellstone, claimed victory over the incumbent Republican, Rudy Boschwitz. Mr. Wellstone held a small lead, but many votes were still uncounted.
In the governor's race, the incumbent, Rudy Perpich, had a harder time after the Republican candidate, Jon Grunseth, made a last-minute exit from the race while dogged by accusations of sexual improprieties. Mr. Grunseth's replacement, Arne Carlson, gave Mr. Perpich a strong challenge.
In the Seventh Congressional District, State Senator Collin C. Peterson beat the Republican incumbent, Arlan Stangeland. The Democrat took advantage of disclosures that Mr. Stangeland had made hundreds of calls to a woman who is a lobbyist. Mr. Stangeland said the calls were business related.
 
MISSOURI
Two House races and an environmental measure dominated this state in the absence of campaigns for governor or the Senate.
Representative Jack Buechner, a Republican seeking his third term in the western St. Louis suburbs, faced Joan Kelly Horn, a Democratic campaign consultant and former head of the Missouri Women's Political Caucus. Ms. Horn sought to make abortion rights a major issue against Mr. Buechner, who opposes abortion.
In southeastern Missouri, Representative Bill Emerson, a five-term Republican who represents the Eighth Congressional District, was re-elected despite a challenge by Russ Carnahan, a Democrat who tried to ride the anti-incumbency issue. He is the son of Mel Carnahan, the Lieutenant Governor.
 
 MICHIGAN
The governor's race seemed a straightforward waltz to re-election for the two-term incumbent, James J. Blanchard, but the 48-year-old Democrat managed to tread on a few toes. He dumped the popular 78-year-old Lieutenant Governor, Martha W. Griffiths, from the ticket, and his two terms coincided with the worsening of the state's economy.
But the Republican, John Engler, did not capitalize on the economic issue, and his opposition to abortion rights brought out legions to campaign for Mr. Blanchard.
 
 NEBRASKA
Senator Jim Exon, the Democrat who won narrowly six years ago against a little-known challenger, faced another tough race, this time against Hal Daub, who was well known after four terms in the House of Representatives.
Gov. Kay A. Orr, a Republican, has been criticized over her refusal to block a proposed radioactive-waste warehouse that would store low-level waste from five states. Ben Nelson, the Omaha lawyer who ran against her, won the Democratic nomination by only 42 votes.
In the Omaha area, Representative Peter Hoagland, a freshman Democrat, campaigned in dozens of town meetings and mailings to fend off a challenge from Ally Milder, a former Senate aide.
 
NORTH DAKOTA
The state's only member of the House of Representatives, Byron L. Dorgan, easily won re-election against his Republican challenger, Edward T. Schafer, heir to a detergent fortune.
While Mr. Schafer tried to tie the Democratic incumbent to the savings and loan crisis and criticized Mr. Dorgan's reliance on out-of-state campaign funds, the Democrat offered himself as a populist who would fight to preserve family farms and expand health care programs in rural areas.
Three ballot initiatives would allow gambling in the state, including the use of video gambling machines.
 
OHIO
Republicans gained the Ohio Statehouse Tuesday when George V. Voinovich, the former Mayor of Cleveland, overcame a late surge of support for Anthony J. Celebrezze, the Attorney General. Gov. Richard F. Celeste, a Democrat, was required to step down after two terms.
Several House races were close. In the Eighth District, State Representative John A. Boehner, Republican, defeated Gregory V. Jolivette, a former Mayor of Hamilton. This is the seat once held by Donald E. Lukens, who was convicted in 1989 of sexual misconduct. In the First District, the Democrat, Charles Luken, the Mayor of Cincinnati, ran against former Mayor J. Kenneth Blackwell.
 
SOUTH DAKOTA
In the Senate race the incumbent, Larry Pressler, narrowly defeated two opponents: a well-financed Democrat and a vituperative newspaper.
Although the challenger, Ted Muenster, a Sioux Falls businessman, was well connected politically and commanded campaign funds approaching $1.6 million, Mr. Pressler mustered enough money to pay for a media campaign that stressed his independence from Republican Party politicking.
Mr. Muenster, who served as chief of staff under Richard F. Kneip when he was Governor, seemed to take his campaign script from The Sioux Falls Argus Leader, the state's largest newspaper. At times the Senator reacted more stridently to the newspaper's criticisms than to his opponent's.
The Democratic candidate was identified with the state's largest city, Sioux Falls, his biggest obstacle to unseating Mr. Pressler, who was strong in rural areas. Mr. Pressler regularly reminded the electorate of his 4-H membership and his John Deere tractor, which he uses to till his 80-acre farm.
 
WISCONSIN
 Wisconsin's popular Governor, Tommy G. Thompson, a Republi can, swept to victory over his Democratic challenger, Assembly Speaker Tom Loftus. Mr. Loftus was unable to mount much of a challenge, despite cam paigns stands that would seem to appeal to much of the state's normally liberal electorate.
 Representative Rob ert W. Kastenmeier of the Madison area, a Democrat who was first elected to the House 32 years ago, was challenged by Scott Klug, a newscaster.
Representative Toby Roth, a conservative Republican from the Green Bay area, defeated State Senator Jerome Van Sistine, overcoming the Democrat's well-financed campaign.
Mr. Van Sistine, popular in organized labor circles, had questioned whether Mr. Roth, a member of the House Banking Comittee, which oversees savings and loans, should bear some responsibility for the industry's crisis.

 BODY:

 ALASKA
In the three-way race for the Governor's mansion, candidates squared off on what restrictions should be placed on development of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and the best way to deal with the impact of a projected decline in oil revenues.
All three candidates have lengthy political records. The Republican candidate, Arliss Sturgulewski, spent 12 years in the State Senate and ran unsuccessfully for governor in 1986. Wally Hickel, who served as Alaska's Governor from 1966 to 1968, differentiated himself from Mrs. Sturgulewski on abortion, which he opposes.
The Democratic candidate, Tony Knowles, 47, made his first bid for governor by emphasizing his role as Mayor of Anchorage. Gov. Steve Cowper did not seek re-election.
Personality upstaged policy in the race for Alaska's sole seat in the House of Representatives. The Republican candidate, Don Young squared off against a former Mayor of Valdez, John S. Devens.
 
ARIZONA
Notable among the state's Congressional races was the Second District's. The Democratic incumbent, Morris K. Udall, head of the House Interior Committee, defeated Joseph D. Sweeney, a law school administrator. Mr. Udall, who suffers from Parkinson's disease, said in May that he planned to retire in 1993.
J. Fife Symington, a Republican and a developer, and Terry Goddard, a Democrat and former Mayor of Phoenix, ran a hotly fought race for Governor.
In winning the Republican nomination, Mr. Symington beat out Evan Mecham, who was impeached and removed as Governor in 1988.
Mr. Goddard, the son of a former Governor, resigned as Mayor to run for the post, after serving as the head of the National League of Cities.
 
COLORADO
In the most hotly contested race in Colorado, Republican Representative Hank Brown won the Senate seat left open by the retirement of William L. Armstrong. Mr. Brown, who raised a large campaign treasury, defeated Josie Heath, a former Boulder County Commissioner who expended nearly all her campaign funds to win a rough primary race.
Mr. Brown's run at the Senate left open his Fourth District seat. The Republican candidate there was State Senator Wayne Allard, a veterinarian who managed Mr. Brown's re-election campaigns in 1984 and 1986. His opponent, State Representative Dick Bond, is a professional biologist and former president of the University of Northern Colorado.
The Governor, Roy Romer, is a popular Democrat who never faced any serious competition. He easily defeated the Republican candidate, John Andrews.
 
CALIFORNIA
 Two former Mayors, Dianne Feinstein and Pete Wilson, fought a tough race for governor. Ms. Feinstein is a Democrat and a former Mayor of San Francisco; Mr. Wilson is a Republican, a former mayor of San Diego and currently a United States Senator.
 Gov. George Deukmejian, a Republican, did not run for re-election.
 In three major Congressional races, incumbents faced strong challenges: Charles Pashayan, a Republican, from the Democratic candi date, Calvin Dooley; George E. Brown Jr., a Democrat, from the Republican candidate, Bob Hammock, and Alfred A. McCandless, a Republican, from the Democratic candidate, Ralph Waite.
There were 28 ballot issues. "Big Green," as one environmental proposition was called, was defeated, as was another proposition to limit terms of state officials.
 
HAWAII
Senator Daniel K. Akaka, a Democrat appointed to the seat after the death in April of Spark M. Matsunaga, defeated Representative Patricia Saiki, a Republican in her second term in the House. Republicans had seen this state as perhaps their best chance to pick up a seat in the Senate, as they hoped Ms. Saiki could make inroads into the customary support Democrats enjoy among Hawaiians of Japanese descent.
State Senator Neil Abercrombie, a Democrat, beat Mike Liu, leader of the Republicans in the State House, for one Congressional seat. Former Representative Patsy Mink, a Democrat who was appointed to Mr. Akaka's seat when he was named to the Senate, defeated former State Representative Andy Poepoe for the other seat. Gov. John Waihee, a Democrat, won re-election.
 
IDAHO
The incumbent Governor, Cecil D. Andrus, a 59-year-old Democrat, defeated Roger Fairchild, a Republican and former majority leader of the State Senate.
He served as Governor from 1971 to 1977 and as President Jimmy Carter's Interior Secretary from 1977 to 1981 before becoming Governor again.
Earlier in the year he vetoed what would have been a highly restrictive state abortion law. For his part, Mr. Fairchild was a declared foe of abortion before winning the Republican gubernatorial nomination.
With incumbent Republican Senator James A. McClure, 65, retiring, the race for his seat was between Representative Larry E. Craig, a Republican, and Ron Twilegar, a Democrat and former state legislator. The victor was Mr. Craig.
Competing for Mr. Craig's Congressional seat were Larry LaRocco, a Democrat and stockbroker, and State Senator C. A. Smyser, a Republican.
 
MONTANA
Senator Max Baucus, a Democrat, won a third term after shunning the complacency of his former colleague, Senator John Melcher. Mr. Melcher, a Democrat, ignored his campaign until the summer of 1988 and was defeated by Conrad Burns, a little known Republican.
Mr. Baucus spent more than a year barnstorming the state and raised more than $2 million in his campaign against Lieut. Gov. Allen C. Kolstad, his Republican opponent. Mr. Kolstad evoked criticism last July by calling threats of acid rain and global warming "scare tactics."
Representative Pat Williams, a six-term Democrat who was co-author of a compromise measure that continued Federal funding for the National Endowment for the Arts while leaving decisions on obscenity to the courts, was re-elected in the First District race by Brad Johnson, a former state party official. Mr. Johnson accused Mr. Williams of supporting pornography.
 
NEVADA
Bob Miller, the Democrat who stepped into the Governor's office two years ago when the incumbent, Richard H. Bryan, was elected to the Senate, sought his own gubernatorial victory to run one of the country's fastest-growing states. He got it.
Mr. Miller, the 45-year-old former two-term District Attorney from Las Vegas, stressed improving education and diversifying the state's economy.
He won easily over Jim Gallaway, a 50-year-old lawyer and former Marine who achieved considerable financial success with his own telecommunications companies.
In the Second District, four-term Representative Barbara F. Vucanovich, a Republican, defeated Jane Wisdom, a State Assemblywoman.
 
NEW MEXICO
With the incumbent Governor, Garrey Carruthers, ineligible to try for re-election, former Gov. Bruce King was the Democratic candidate for the post.
In an energetic race, he beat former State Representative Frank Bond, the Republican candidate.
The 66-year-old Mr. King, a rancher and businessman, was Governor from 1971 to 974 and again from 1979 to 1982. In this year's campaign, he stressed education, the environment and economic development. To spur economic development, he called for steps to create more growth in the state's private business sector.
Mr. Bond, a 47-year-old lawyer and rancher with land interests, also stressed economic policies, calling for various measures to promote diversfied development and create additonal jobs in the state.
Senator Pete V. Domenici, a third-term Republican, crushed his challenger, Democratic State Senator Tom R. Benavides.
 
OREGON
After four terms in the Senate, Mark O. Hatfield, the Republican once best known as a dove on defense issues, defeated Harry Lonsdale, a wealthy Democratic businessman with environmental credentials. But Mr. Lonsdale's appeal forced Mr. Hatfield into an aggressive and uncharacteristically negative campaign.
In the race for governor, Attorney General David Frohnmayer, a Republican, went into the campaign a favorite to succeed Gov. Neil Goldschmidt, a Democrat who is retiring. But by the end of the campaign, Secretary of State Barbara Roberts, a Democrat, came on strong.
Support for Mr. Frohnmayer was partly eroded by a third candidate, Al Mobley, a conservative-independent who emphasized his opposition to abortion.
In the northwest corner of the state, Mike Kopetski, a Democrat, mounted another strong campaign against Representative Denny Smith, a Republican. Mr. Kopetski fell just 707 votes short of Mr. Smith two years ago. This time, Mr. Smith was hurt by a combination of bad publicity over his links to the savings and loan industry, a heavy-handed radio advertisement that featured sound of a Hitler rally as Mr. Smith accused Mr. Kopetski of "appeasement," and Mr. Smith's support of the timber industry.
Democrats currently control both the House and Senate, but the loss of only two House seats would cost them control there and give the Republicans a chance to influence redistricting next year.
 
UTAH
Representative Wayne Owens of Salt Lake City, who has been the only Democrat in Utah's delegation, defeated a challenge from Genevieve Atwood, a 44-year old Republican who is a former state representative and former state geologist.
Another Democrat, Bill Orton, will join the delegation, in the Provo seat left open by Representative Howard C. Nielson, a Republican who is retiring. Mr. Orton, a tax lawyer and first-time candidate, won a battle for the traditionally Republican seat by defeating former State Senator Karl Snow, a professor and administrator at Brigham Young University, who was the subject of a Provo Herald investigation into his ownership of certain stocks and his business association with a convicted felon.
 
WASHINGTON
 Two spirited House contests and ballot refer endums on tax limita tions and the environ ment confronted the voters.
 From the moment that Representative Jolene Unsoeld was elected to Congress in 1988 by only 618 votes, she became a leading target of the Republicans. Her opponent was Bob Williams, a former State Representative. He accused Mrs.Unsoeld of being a typical "tax and spend liberal." She said Mr. Williams was anti-environment and conservative.
 In another contest, Representative John Miller, a conservative Republican in his third term representing the First Congressional District in northern Seattle, was challenged by Cynthia Sullivan, a member of the King County Council. She said Mr. Miller had neglected local problems, including traffic congestion, and voted wrong on environmental issues. But his endorsement by the Sierra Club and the League of Conservation Voters deflated that issue.
The ballot included proposals to limit property taxes to 1 percent of the true value of property and to give preferred treatment to properties that complied with safety and health standards or had low-income housing.
 
WYOMING
Wyoming Democrats conceded they never had much chance of defeating Senator Alan K. Simpson, a national figure who is the second most powerful Republican in the Senate. The best candidate they could come up with was Kathy Helling, a 32-year-old sociology major at the University of Wyoming who defeated five other equally unknown primary candidates.
It was a lopsided contest. Mrs. Helling spent about $6,000 on her losing campaign, compared with more than $1 million raised by Mr. Simpson.
In Wyoming's sole Congressional district, Craig Thomas, a Republican who was chosen in a special election last year to replace Dick Cheney when he was named Secretary of Defense, ran against Peter Maxfield, a Democratic lawyer.
Gov. Michael Sullivan, a Democrat, won re-election, defeating Mary Mead.

 BODY:

ALABAMA
Senator Howell Heflin, 69 years old, a Democrat, beat Republican, State Senator Bill Cabaniss, 52.
Mr. Cabaniss sought to depict Mr. Heflin as lacking concern for the environment. In rebuttal, Mr. Heflin emphasized his own concern for a forest in the state.
The Republican Governor, Guy Hunt, 57, overcame his Democratic opponent, Paul Hubbert.
Democrats contended that Mr. Hunt's campaign had a racial component meant to stir his conservative supporters.
 
ARKANSAS
Bill Clinton won a fifth term as Governor, defeating Sheffield Nelson, a former executive at a natural gas company. Mr. Clinton, a Democrat, was the beneficiary of a bruising Republican primary that left the Republican nominee weakened.
Senator David Pryor, the Democratic incumbent, ran unopposed, and the state's three incumbent members of the House of Representatives -- Democrats Bill Alexander and Beryl Anthony Jr., and Republican John Paul Hammerschmidt -- all won. In the 2d Congressional District encompassing Little Rock, former Representative Ray Thornton, a Democrat, beat Jim Keet, a Republican State Representative.
 
FLORIDA
Former Senator Lawton Chiles defeated the incumbent Republican Governor, Bob Martinez, in a race that in its final weeks focused largely on abortion.
Supporters of abortion rights were upset last year when Mr. Martinez tried to have the Legislature place new restrictions on abortions. The effort failed.
Senator Chiles, a Democrat who is one of the most popular political figures in the state, reluctantly supports abortion rights. Although he was widely seen as the victor in last week's televised debate with Governor Martinez, he was hurt among some voters because of his acknowledged use of a powerful anti-depressive drug.
In another hotly contested race, Representative Bill Grant of Tallahassee was defeated by Pete Peterson, a Democrat who is a retired Air Force colonel. Shortly after his re-election in 1988, Mr. Grant switched parties and became a Republican, a move Mr. Peterson painted as a breach of faith with voters.
Florida is expected to be one of the big winners in Congressional reapportionment next year. The state could pick up as many as four seats in the House, and Democrats in the Legislature will control the redistricting.
 
LOUISIANA
Democrats had hopes of defeating Senator Mitch McConnell, who won a narrow victory in 1984 in this heavily Democratic state. But Mr. McConnell, who showed himself to be a deft campaigner and used his incumbency to his advantage, won easily over his Democratic challenger, Havey I. Sloane, former Mayor of Louisville. Incumbents won all seven of their House races.
 
GEORGIA
 Senator Sam Nunn, the Democrat who heads the Armed Services Com mittee, was unopposed in his quest for a fourth term, but there were enough bruising races to excite the voters. Zell Miller, the Democratic Lieutenant Governor, won the contest for governor against Johnny Isakson, the State House Minority Leader, the strongest gubernatorial candidate that the Republicans have fielded in years. The incumbent, Joe Frank Harris, was ineligible to run for a third term.
 Representative Newt Gingrich, the House Republican whip who led a revolt against a White House-approved budget compromise, ran in a tough race against David Worley, whom he handily defeated in 1988. In another race, Representative Doug Barnard, a Democrat, won re-election to an eighth term despite his problems explaining his ties to savings and loan institutions, which became a major issue raised by Sam Jones, his Republican opponent. Mr. Barnard is chairman of a subcommittee that oversees savings institutions. He had to explain why he accepted $20,000 in campaign contributions from Charles H. Keating Jr., who has been indicted for his role in the savings and loan scandal.
 
MISSISSIPPI
After defeating a strong Democratic opponent, former Gov. William F. Winter, to win a second term in 1984 vote, Mississippi's senior Senator, Thad Cochran, was in such a strong political position this year that no serious candidate chose to oppose him. Mr. Cochran was the first Republican to win a Mississippi Senate seat in the 1900's and the first Republican to win a statewide majority since Reconstruction. He did it again this year.
Republican Trent Lott, is elected in 1988 to replace the retiring John C. Stennis, is the other senator.
 Jamie L. Whitten, a veteran Democratic Representative first elected in 1941, was relelected once more.
 
NORTH CAROLINA
In the nasty Senate race, the incumbent Republican, Jesse Helms, defeated Harvey Gantt, the former Mayor of Charlotte, with about 54 percent of the vote. Mr. Gantt had hoped to become the first black Senator from the South since Reconstruction.
Political analysts said Mr. Gantt had been hurt by Senator Helms's late television commercials portraying the Democrat as an advocate of racial employment quotas. Democratic organizers said Mr. Helms's campaign, with its dependence on racial themes, offended black and white voters alike.
Representative David E. Price, a Democrat, was re-elected despite a well-financed campaign by a Raleigh businessman, John H. Carrington. Mr. Carrington scored with some voters by focusing on Mr. Price's ties to the savings and loan industry. The incumbent relied on a strong Gantt turnout.
 
OKLAHOMA
 In a three-way guber natorial contest that was bitterly contested, Democratic candidate David Walters was the winner. A 38-year-old Roman Catholic, Mr. Walters supported a woman's right to choose an abortion and took a hard line against new taxes.
 Republican Bill Price, a former United States Attorney, opposed new taxes and abortion. The dark horse in the racewas Thomas Ledger wood, a lawyer who has been a registered inde pendent since he was 21.
 Democratic Senator David L. Boren easily won a third term with popularity that transcended party lines and a $1 million campaign fund.
 
SOUTH CAROLINA
An F.B.I. bribery investigation transformed normally routine elections for the State Legislature into competitive races as voters screamed for new state ethics and disclosure laws.
Republican Senator Strom Thurmond, who has 45 years of experience in the Senate, defeated the Democratic contender, Bob Cunningham, a retired intelligence officer. At the end of his new term, Mr. Thurmond would be be 94 years old and the oldest man ever to serve in the Senate.
Democratic Representative Butler Derrick won his ninth term in Congress, despite Republican strength in neighboring districts. Democratic Representative Liz J. Patterson overcame similar odds against Ray Haskett.
 
TENNESSEE
Despite all the talk of the perils of incumbency, a number of office holders were easily re-elected. Senator Al Gore trounced his Republican rival, William R. Hawkins, a Knoxville economist, while Gov. Neal McWherter, was the victor over Dwight Henry, a Republican state lawmaker. All nine members of the House from Tennessee, expected to win re-election, including including Harold E. Ford, a Democrat from Memphis whose trial on Federal bank and mail fraud charges ended in a deadlocked jury in April.
 
TEXAS
In one of the nation's most rancorous gubernatorial contests, Ann Richards, the State Treasurer, a Democrat, defeated Republican Clayton Williams, a wealthy rancher and businessman. Ms. Richards won a bitter three-way primary in which she was accused of past drug use, while Mr. Williams admitted going to prostitutes as a youth and joked about rape. In the last week of the campaign, Mr. Williams acknowledged that he paid no income tax in 1986 and confessed his ignorance of a proposed constitutional amendment.
Senator Phil Gramm, a Republican, easily won re-election in a well-financed campaign against State Senator Hugh Parmer, a Democrat. Mr. Gramm is best known as a sponsor of the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings budget bill.
 
VIRGINIA
Republican Senator John W. Warner easily won a third term, with no Democratic candidate opposing him. Senator Warner's only opposition was Nancy B. Spannaus, a supporter of Lyndon H. LaRouche Jr., who was listed on the ballot as an independent and took only a small fraction of the vote.
Former Gov. Gerald L. Baliles, a Democrat who left office early this year, would not run for the Senate, and his successor, L. Douglas Wilder, advised his party to abandon the race rather than run a candidate who would be crushed.
Stan Parris, a 61-year old conservative Republican, lost his House seat to James P. Moran Jr., the 45-year-old Democratic Mayor of Alexandria. In Charlottesville, Representative D. French Slaughter Jr., a Republican, won his fourth term in Congress, fighting off David M. Smith.

HEADLINE: Upset by Beggars, Washington Is Arresting Them

BYLINE: By IRVIN MOLOTSKY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 6

 BODY:
Responding to complaints about panhandlers on the street, District of Columbia police officials said today that they had been using an almost-forgotten law to arrest beggars.
Capt. Bruce McDonald, a police commander, said that nine panhandlers had been arrested since Oct. 3 in the affluent business and residential areas of Georgetown and Dupont Circle. 
 There have been complaints that the arrests are unconstitutional. The Supreme Court has ruled in several cases that charitable solicitation is protected by the First Amendment's guarantee of free speech.
But the Justices have not applied those precedents to panhandling for personal benefit. When a Federal district judge in New York, Leonard B. Sand, ruled that begging in the subway was protected by the First Amendment, the ruling was overturned by the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. The Supreme Court will decide later this year whether to hear the case.
 
Upholding of Law Predicted
 The Washington Police Department's general counsel, Geraldine R. Gennet, said today that the local ordinance, which has been on the books for decades, "should withstand scrutiny and be constitutionally valid."
There was no public announcement of the decision to make the arrests, but Captain McDonald told a Dupont Circle neighborhood association about it Monday night and confirmed his account in an interview today. The maximum penalty for panhandling is 90 days in jail and a $300 fine, but Captain McDonald said all the charges in the arrests had been dropped.
At the civic association meeting, Captain McDonald was asked if the police had heard any complaints from the American Civil Liberties Union. He replied, "No, but I'm sure we will."
Asked about it today, Arthur B. Spitzer, legal director of the local chapter of the civil liberties union, said he had not heard of the arrests but asserted, "It sounds unconstitutional to me."
"If somebody says to you, 'Buddy, can you spare a dime?' that's no less free speech than if he says, 'Buddy, can you spare a dime for cancer research?' " Mr. Spitzer added that his group was likely to challenge the ordinance.
An illegal vagrant is defined by the ordinance as "any person wandering abroad and begging, or who goes about from door to door or places himself in or on any highway, passage or other public place to beg or receive alms."
 
Public Complaints Increasing
 Ms. Gennet said the Police Department decided to start using the ordinance because of rising complaints from the public about begging. She added that the police were encouraged by the Federal appeals court decision in the New York City case against soliciting on the subway.
Then a City Council member, John Wilson, proposed a law outlawing abusive panhandling. The city's lawyers, while researching his request, found that the old statute, passed in 1941 and modifed in 1953, was still on the books.
Regarding the position that the courts have held that begging is constitutionally protected as a manifestation of free speech, Ms. Gennet said: "The concern is that free speech be protected. The Court has never held that begging under any circumstance has to be protected free speech."
Officer Quentin Peterson, a Police Department spokesman, said the citywide arrest totals for begging had not been calculated, but Captain McDonald said there were more in police districts other than his.
"It's gotten out of hand in D.C.," he said. "We've got a lot of complaints."
Mr. Spitzer of the civil liberties union said of the increase in panhandling: "That's an unfortunate cost of urban society and the economy -- problems of homelessness and unemployment. The District of Columbia jails are overflowing. It is hard to justify putting a lot of police and prison resources into panhandling.
"People aren't panhandling for fun."

HEADLINE: The 1990 Elections: State By State;
Northeast

 BODY:

CONNECTICUT
Lowell P. Weicker Jr., erstwhile Senate maverick, used his strong local appeal to capture the anti-incumbent fever that swept through the electorate and win the election.
Running as an independent, the three-term former Senator defeated the Democratic nominee, Representative Bruce A. Morrison, and the Republican candidate, Representative John G. Rowland.
The House seat abandoned by Mr. Morrison was won by Rosa DeLauro, 47, a Democrat who has never held elective office, in a close contest with State Senator Thomas Scott, 32, a conservative Republican.
Mr. Rowland's vacated seat was filled by fellow Republican Gary Frank, a 37-year-old alderman from Waterbury who beat Toby Moffett. a former Democratic Representative, in a close race.
 
DELAWARE
In the "Small Wonder" state, two well-established, well-financed incumbents faced political neophytes who were trying to take advantage of voters' feelings against career politicians.
In the race for the United States Senate, the 47-year-old Democratic incumbent, Joseph R. Biden, Jr., faced M. Jane Brady, a 39-year-old Republican who is chief prosecutor for Sussex County. Ms. Brady called for Congress to be transformed into a citizens' Legislature with a two-term limit; Mr. Biden campaigned on his record. Delaware has only 297,000 registered voters; Democrats hold a slight advantage.
Fighting over Delaware's single seat in the House was the three-term Democratic incumbent, Thomas R. Carper, and Ralph O. Williams, a real estate developer. The savings and loan crisis was a primary issue in the campaign. Mr. Carper is a member of the House Banking Committee, and Mr. Williams is a former president of a savings and loan association.
 
DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA
District of Columbia voters put an outsider, Sharon Pratt Dixon, into the Mayor's seat while turning back Mayor Marion S. Barry Jr.'s bid for electoral redemption in the wake of his misdemeanor conviction on a drug possession charge.
With Democrats outnumbering republicans 9 to 1, Ms. Dixon had no trouble defeating former Police Chief Maurice T. Turner to become the first black woman chosen to run a major city.
Mr. Barry, sentenced to six months in prison last month, ran a distant third in his bid to take one of the two at-large seats on the City Council.
Eleanor Holmes Norton, a Democrat plagued by her failure to file local tax returns, defeated Harry M. Singleton, a Republican, to take the job as the District's non-voting delegate in the House.
The Rev. Jesse Jackson easily won the job as the city's "shadow senator" post to lobby in the Senate for statehood for the city.
 
MAINE
 The contest for gover nor was termed a race between two incum bents. And indeed, the candidates -- Gov. John R. McKernan Jr., the Republican, and Representative Joseph E. Brennan, the former Governor -- are well known and well financed.
 Mr. Brennan excoriated his opponent in 30-second television advertisements for his handling of the state budget. Mr. McKernan charged that Mr. Brennan had flip-flopped on his sup port for Maine Yankee, the state's nuclear power plant.
Senator William S. Cohen, the Republican incumbent, defeated State Representative Neil Rolde. In the race to replace Mr. Brennan in Maine's First Congressional District, Thomas H. Andrews, a liberal Democrat who had built one of the strongest grass-roots organizations in the state, easily defeated David F. Emery, a conservative Republican, who held the seat from 1975 until he engaged in a disastrous run for the Senate in 1982 against George J. Mitchell.
Mr. Emery angered anti-abortion advocates by switching from an anti-abortion stance to one supporting a woman's right to an abortion.
 
MARYLAND
The incumbent Governor, William Donald Schaefer, a 69-year-old Democrat and ex-Mayor of Baltimore, defeated his Republican opponent, William S. Shepard, a retired Foreign Service officer.
In the state's First Congressional District, the five-term incumbent Democrat, Roy P. Dyson, 41, was defeated by his Republican challenger, Wayne T. Gilchrest, a 44-year-old high school teacher who also ran against him in 1988.
Mr. Dyson had been renominated by his party despite the dislosure that he had been a conscientious objector at the time of the Vietnam War.
Mr. Gilchrest won a Purple Heart as a Marine in Vietnam.
Mr. Gilchrest's support for abortion rights was earlier thought to have lost him some Republican backing.
In addition, Mr. Gilchrest had more liberal positions than Mr. Dyson on some other issues.
 
MASSACHUSETTS
 After a duel that riveted the state's atten tion, John R. Silber, the Boston University presi dent, who ran as the tart-tongued Democratic candidate, conceded vic tory to his Republican opponent, William F. Weld, the former United States Attorney, who served in the Justice De partment in the Reagan Administration.
 Mr. Weld was helped by Dr. Silber's blunt personality, which drove many of the state's Democratic voters to abandon their party.
 Both gubernatorial candidates favored approval of Question 3, a tax rollback referendum that would have slashed state revenue by about $1.1 billion through cuts in various fees and taxes, but the voters defeated the proposition.
Senator John Kerry, a Democrat, managed to distance himself from Gov. Michael S. Dukakis, whom he served as Lieutenant Governor from 1982 to 1984, and defeat the Republican, Jim Rappaport.
Only one House member, Chester G. Atkins, a Democrat from the Fifth District, had faced a serious threat. His opponent was State Representative John F. MacGovern.
 
NEW HAMPSHIRE
Representative Robert C. Smith, widely considered the heir apparent to retiring Republican Senator Gordon J. Humphrey, defeated former Senator John A. Durkin to keep the Senate seat for the Republicans. This was one of three Senate seats around the country that had been left open by retiring Republicans.
The Democrats also were not able to unseat the Republican Governor, Judd Gregg, who easily outpaced his Democratic challenger, Joseph Grandmaison.
Pounding rain and heavy winds kept some voters away early Tuesday. There was a close fight for Mr. Smith's First District seat, which was won by the Republican, William Zeliff, an innkeeper who carried a jar of pennies on the campaign trail and portrayed himself a penny-pinching tightwad.
 
NEW JERSEY
Senator Bill Bradley defeated Christine Todd Whitman by an unexpectedly slim margin even though he had greatly outspent the virtually unknown Republican candidate.
Throughout the campaign, Mrs. Whitman, a former state official, tried to link Mr. Bradley to the $2.8 billion tax package pushed through the Legislature by Gov. James J. Florio, a Democrat, in his first six months in office.
The new taxes triggered a taxpayer revolt that became the focus of every state, county and local race on Tuesday. Mr. Bradley often found himself ducking attempts to be aligned with Mr. Florio and the tax changes.
Incumbents in 12 of the 14 Congressional Districts were considered safe, but there were tough races in the districts once held by Mr. Florio and his opponent in last year's election for governor, Representative Jim Courter. In Mr. Florio's former First District seat, the Democrat, Robert E. Andrews, the Camden County Freeholder Director, won despite being criticized for his connection to the Governor. In the 12th District, State Senator Richard Zimmer, a Republican, outdistanced Marguerite Chandler.
New Jersey lost one Congressional seat after the 1980 census and is expected to lose another this year.
 
NEW YORK
Without a Senate race this year, considerable attention focused on New York's campaign for governor. But this was not because Mario M. Cuomo, the Democratic incumbent, was in any kind of jeopardy of losing his bid for a third term.
Opponents for the 58-year-old Governor and Queens native were Pierre A. Rinfret, a Republican reluctantly running on the Republican ticket, and Herbert London, a Republican running on the Conservative Party ticket. Mr. Rinfret was trying to stave off a third-place finish for the Republicans, which would cost the party its prized spot on the second row of all ballots in New York for the next four years as well as joint control with the Democrats of every County Board of Elections in the state.
 
PENNSYLVANIA
In an upset, Representative Doug Walgren, a seven-term Democratic Congressman from Pittsburgh, lost to a political neophyte, Richard Santorum, a 32-year-old Republican lawyer who ran on an anti-incumbent theme.
Gov. Robert P. Casey, a popular Democrat and Pennsylvania's first Governor in 43 years not to raise taxes, was re-elected to a second term. His Republican opponent, State Auditor General Barbara Hafer, failed to win much support or money, even from within her own party in this largely Democratic state.
The race initially appeared to be referendum on abortion, with Mr. Casey opposing almost all abortions and Mrs. Hafer supporting a woman's right to abortion. But the issue largely faded behind more immediate concerns like education and the economy.
Redistricting is expected to cost Pennsylvania 2 of its 23 seats in the House, and how the political map will be redrawn depended on a handful of close races for the State Legislature.
Ballot initiatives sought voter approval for selling bonds to build prisons and buy equipment for firefighters and ambulance services.
 
RHODE ISLAND
Bruce G. Sundlun, a 70-year-old Democratic broadcasting executive, was elected Governor, defeating the incumbent, Edward D. DiPrete, a 56-year-old Republican in a heavily Democratic state.
Mr. Sundlun lost to Mr. DiPrete in the last two races for governor, but only by a narrow margin in 1988.
Mr. DiPrete's popularity began a free fall that year, after his family made $2 million in a single day on a real estate transaction in Cranston, where Mr. DiPrete had served as Mayor.
Claiborne Pell, a Democrat who has spent 39 of his 71 years in the Senate, won another term. He defeated Claudine Schneider, a 43-year-old Republican, who gave up her seat in the House.
The state has only two seats in the House. Ronald K. Machtley, the Republican incumbent, defeated Scott Wolf, a Democratic political consultant. In the contest over the seat vacated by Ms. Schneider, State Representative Jack Reed, a Democrat, defeated Trudy Coxe, a Republican who has been involved in environmental issues.
 
VERMONT
Bernard Sanders, a socialist who ran as an independent, won Vermont's only Congressional seat, upsetting the incumbent, Peter Smith, a Republican. Mr. Sanders, who was Mayor of Burlington from 1981 to 1989, toned down his Marxist slogans and ran on a populist platform attacking Washington politicians.
Richard A. Snelling, the popular four-term Republican Governor from 1976 to 1984, was elected to another term. He defeated Peter F. Welch, the first Democratic President pro tempore of the Republican-controlled State Senate.
Mr. Snelling, who is 63 years old and owns an investment business, tried to project an image as a fiscal conservative and prudent manager. Mr. Welch, 43, sought to undermine Mr. Snelling's campaign with negative advertising that portrayed Mr. Snelling as a wealthy businessman out of touch with the concerns of most Vermonters.
Governor Madeleine M. Kunin, a Democrat, did not seek re-election.
 
WEST VIRGINIA
Senator John D. Rockefeller 4th coasted into his second term, handily defeating John Yoder, a lawyer from Harper's Ferry.
 Mr. Rockefeller, who spent most of his first term working on unglamorous health, transportaion and economic issues affecting the state, defused Mr. Yoder's campaign charges that he was a "captive of special interests."
 Voters in the mountains of the Second Congressional District rejected Oliver Luck's attempt to capitalize on his fame as a quarterback at the University of West Virginia.
 He was defeated by Representative Harley O. Staggers Jr., who will return to Washington for a fifth term in the House.

HEADLINE: Burger King Ads Help End Boycott by Religious Group

BYLINE: By ANTHONY RAMIREZ

 BODY:
It was a puzzling declaration with an even more puzzling provenance. The Burger King Corporation, without explanation, took out large advertisements in newspapers all over the country to say that the fast-food company "wishes to go on record as supporting traditional American values on television."
The advertisements, which ran Sunday and Monday, grew out of a skirmish between Burger King and a religious group, the Christian Leadership for Responsible Television. Earlier in the year, the group had accused the company of sponsoring television shows that were "against family values" and began a boycott of the chain on Sept. 1. 
 One of the founders of the group, known as Clear-TV, was Donald Wildmon, who has successfully lobbied other major corporations over what he regarded as objectionable programming.
Clear-TV had complained that the "anti-family" programs that Burger King commercials helped to support showed "gratuitous sex, violence and anti-Christian stereotyping." Neither Billy Melvin, chairman of Clear-TV, nor Cori Zywotow, a Burger King spokeswoman, would identify the programs.
After two meetings lasting nearly three hours each at Burger King's Miami headquarters last week, Clear-TV and Burger King settled their differences. As a result, Burger King ran the half-page ads, with the title "An Open Letter to the American People," in several hundred newspapers, including The Los Angeles Times, The Miami Herald, The New York Times and USA Today.
"We were pleased with the results of the talks," Ms. Zywotow said. "It's better not to be boycotted than to be boycotted." She said Burger King did not change its advertising policy as a result of the talks.
But some said they were shocked by Burger King's action. "This is unbelievable," said Jeff Cohen, executive director of Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting, a media-monitoring group. "It's the equivalent of a loyalty oath. A major corporation takes out a major advertisement nationwide to say nothing, except the magic code words to assuage these interest groups."
 
Responding to Protest
 The skirmish also illustrates how, in an uncertain economy, and in this case, in the slow-growing fast-food industry, large corporations are quick to respond to even a flicker of consumer protest to keep from losing any potential sales.
This appears to be so even though Burger King and the group agreed that the two-month-old boycott was ineffective. Ms. Zywotow of Burger King said the protest had "no impact" on Burger King's restaurant revenue, which analysts estimate will total $5.9 billion this year.
Burger King is a division of the Pillsbury Company, which is owned by Britain's Grand Metropolitan P.L.C. The chain has more than 6,000 restaurants worldwide, about 90 percent of which are in the United States. It is the world's second-largest hamburger chain after McDonald's.
Mr. Melvin of Clear-TV agreed that the boycott led by his group, which claims millions of members, had little economic effect. "Burger King wanted to talk to us so fast that we just didn't get a chance to hype the boycott," he said.
 
Coalition of Groups
 Clear-TV, based in Wheaton, Ill., is a coalition of 1,600 Protestant ministers, Roman Catholic priests and other Christian leaders. The group says these leaders' congregations and parishes represent 60 million people.
In January, Clear-TV planned pressure on corporate advertisers by having 3,000 members in 33 states watch prime-time television during the spring "sweeps" season. This is the period when advertising rates are determined on the basis of network studies of viewership.
Clear-TV identified what it called the 10 worst offending corporate sponsors of what it considered objectionable television shows. Except for Burger King, Mr. Melvin did not identify the companies.
The group said seven companies persuaded it that they were just as interested in family values as Clear-TV. Burger King was not among the seven because it said letters from Clear-TV were sent to an office of its corporate parent in New Jersey instead of Burger King's Miami base.
 
'Pre-Screening' Policies
 Mr. Melvin did not say why Clear-TV had made Burger King a target for a boycott out of the three companies that did not respond. He said one of the goals of Clear-TV was to pursuade corporations to "pre-screen" individual shows they sponsor for objectionable content.
Burger King, which said it pre-screens all shows it sponsors, plans to spend about $215 million this year on advertising and promotions. Its advertising is handled by D'Arcy Masius Benton & Bowles, and Saatchi & Saatchi Advertising, both of New York.
Louis E. Bradley, vice president of Advertising Information Services Inc., said he was not aware of an upsurge in corporate concern over things like "anti-Christian stereotyping." His company uses screeners to alert advertisers to potential problems: for instance, a beer maker advertising on a show that depicts drunken driving.

HEADLINE: C.D.'s and Bank Funds Fall

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO

 BODY:
Yields on bank certificates of deposit and money market accounts fell for the week that ended yesterday.
The Chase Manhattan Bank said its customers were still attracted to the shorter maturities, those of less than a year, because of the uncertainty of the times. 
 At the Treasury's Department's regular weekly bill auction on Monday, where the results often indicate what many banks may eventually pay on money market accounts and certificates of deposit, rates were down for the second straight week.
 
3-Month Bill at 7.07%
 The average discount rate at auction for a new three-month bill this week was 7.07 percent, down by 5 basis points from the previous auction. For a six-month bill, the average rate was 7.05 percent, down by 8 basis points. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
In its weekly survey of New York area commercial banks and savings institutions, The Bank Rate Monitor said that yields on certificates of deposit at commercial banks declined more than those at savings institutions. The average commercial bank money market account fell by a basis point, to 6.15 percent, while three-month and six-month certificates fell 2 basis points each, to 7.64 percent and 7.70 percent, respectively.
Yields at savings institutions, though lower, were still higher than those at commercial banks. The average money market account was off by a basis point, to 6.35 percent and a three-month certificate down by 2 basis points, to 7.75 percent, and a six-month certificate unchanged at 7.82 percent.
Outside the New York area and among 20 large banks nationwide, the yields were also down. The average yield on a money market account fell by 2 basis points, to 6.23 percent, and the average on a six-month certificate was down by the same, to 7.42 percent.
 
More Institutions Cutting Rates
 Among the more than 100 leading banks and savings institutions in 10 large markets nationally, the number of institutions lowering rates on deposits in the last two weeks has risen dramtically.
Meanwhile, the Treasury, which competes with banks for deposit money through the issuance of savings bonds, said it had set the semiannual market-based interest rate for United States savings bonds, in effect from Nov. 1, 1990, through April 30, 1991, at 7.19 percent. The new rates were up from the previous rate of 7.01 percent, which was in effect from May through October 1990.
Savings bonds semiannual rates are adjusted each May 1 and Nov. 1 to reflect market activity during the preceding six months.

HEADLINE: Conference on Climate Singles Out U.S. as Wastrel of Energy

BYLINE: By MARLISE SIMONS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: GENEVA, Nov. 6

 BODY:
The United States was depicted as the great polluter among rich nations today at a gathering of about 80 environment ministers, environmental campaigners and industry specialists.
All industrial nations except the United States have come to the Second World Climate Conference here with freshly set targets to slow down or to reverse their output of carbon dioxide, the gas thought to be the main culprit in what could be a dangerous warming of the earth's atmosphere. 
 While renewed warnings from scientists, gathered here last week, set the tone for today's debate, most politicians from industrial countries said they had made their pledges because it is good business.
Government representatives from Western Europe, Japan, New Zealand and Australia said that studies in the last year had shown that they could stabilize and eventually cut back carbon dioxide output at no extra cost to the overall economy. They said they could achieve their targets through new laws and regulations that would force people and industry to use energy more efficiently.
 
Thatcher Criticizes U.S. Approach
 Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher of Britain, who has departed from the Bush Administration's skepticism about the need for immediate action, today chided Washington at the conference by saying a clear case already existed for taking immediate precautions. "The need for more research should not be an excuse for much needed action now," she said.
She seemed to express a majority view here when she argued that in any event, it was sensible to improve energy efficency and use energy prudently, to develop alternative sources of supply, to replant forests, to re-examine industrial processes and to tackle waste disposal. France's Prime Minister, Michel Rocard, and Germany's Environment Minister, Klaus Topfer, made similar pleas.
European officials here complained that American energy prices were too low and provided no incentive for conservation.
Rather than setting back industry, Germany and Japan have argued, the new program will stimulate industry through the development of new technology.
"What we are all talking about is straightforward energy policy," said Pier Vellinga, who is in charge of climate policy in the Netherlands. "It will mean redirecting investments, not building more power plants or digging more coal, and becoming less dependent on oil."
 
All Getting Similar Findings
 Referring to studies on the economic impact of reducing carbon dioxide emissions made in the European Community, Scandinavia and other areas, he said, "We have all done them and we are all coming up with the same results."
Under the programs to combat global warming announced in more than 20 nations in recent days, governments have committed themselves to targets ranging from slowing down emissions of carbon dioxide to reversing the rate. These nations together account for close to 19 percent of the world's carbon dioxide output, while the United States accounts for close to 22 percent.
Germany has the most drastic objectives. Outlining a plan already approved in part by the German Parliament, Mr. Topfer said steps would include new laws requiring greater insulation of buildings, improvements in public transportation and making power plants more efficient. It would also mean levying taxes on most carbon dioxide emissions, including additional taxes on fossil fuels.
Next on the scale of cutbacks is Denmark, which hopes to produce 20 percent less carbon dioxide than it does today by the year 2005, and 50 percent less by 2030. The Netherlands intends to stabilize its output by 1994 and cut back to 5 percent of present levels by the year 2000.
The United States has calculated that if present trends continue, the nation's carbon dioxide emissions will have increased 15 percent by 2000.

HEADLINE: Islamic Politics Drive Away Allies of the Sudan

BYLINE: By JANE PERLEZ, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: KHARTOUM, the Sudan, Nov. 2

 BODY:
Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi, the Libyan leader, came here not long ago for what was supposed to be a celebration of his Sudanese neighbors' decision to adopt, in part, his political system.
Instead, Colonel Qaddafi delivered a frosty lecture to the Islamic fundamentalist junta last month about the folly of mixing religion and politics. Surprisingly, Colonel Qaddafi became the instant hero of the Sudanese underground opposition. 
 Colonel Qaddafi's disdain for much that the 16-month-old Government stands for underlined the increasing political isolation of the Sudan in the Arab world and among its longtime allies in the West.
The Sudan's growing isolation is a product of its Islamic fundamentalist politics, with the accompanying drive to establish a theocracy, and its sympathetic stand toward Iraq. The fact that the Sudan is one of only two countries to be declared not to be cooperating with the International Monetary Fund does not help either, diplomats here said.
The largest country on the African continent and a nation dominated by a mostly Arab population, the Sudan was until 1985 one of the largest recipients of Washington's economic and military aid in the Arab world. After the Government of President Gaafar al-Nimeiri was overthrown in 1985, the aid gradually diminished until this year, when Washington refused to deliver any new economic aid and cut the last remnants of military aid.
Washington has said it will help the Sudan with food to help it avert what many relief officials say will be a devestating famine next year, but only on the condition that the Sudan stop its obstruction of humanitarian aid.
The Sudan's traditional Arab allies, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and Egypt, angered at the junta's refusal to join the alliance against Iraq, have also turned away from the Sudan. The Saudis and the Kuwaitis feel particularly bitter, Arab diplomats said, because it was through relationships with Saudi banks and Kuwaiti financial institutions that the Muslim Brotherhood, the fundamentalist organization behind the junta, won its extraordinary wealth.
Much of the Brotherhood's money is kept outside the Sudan but is used to recruit an increasing number of young followers, many of whom are turning up in important positions in Government ministries, the Arab diplomats said.
Others are members of Sudan Security, a new Islamic security group that has been arresting suspected opponents, imprisoning them and in some cases applying torture, according to United States officials. The Sudan has about 300 political detainees, and while some have been released, new detainees have been arrested, said Jeffrey Davidow, Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs.
Even before the gulf crisis, the Saudis had begun to reduce their oil supply to the Sudan, and now it has been cut to zero, the diplomats said.
The isolation of the Sudan seems to be so complete, the diplomats said, that the Iranian authorities canceled a visit planned for this week by the Sudanese leader, Lieut. Gen. Omar Hassan Ahmed al-Bashir, apparently because the Iranians were not prepared to help out with his shopping list of oil and other requirements.
Diplomats here said Colonel Qaddafi declared his disapproval of the mixture of politics and religion because he is concerned about the surge of Islamic fundamentalism around him, including increases in the strength of fundamentalist parties in Tunisia, Algeria and Egypt as well as in the Sudan, where fundamentalists have succeeded in taking over the Government.
"Qaddafi finds himself surrounded by fundamentalism and he is uncomfortable with this state of affairs," an Arab diplomat said. "They will deprive him of an audience on Arab unity, which he thinks should happen as a counter to the new House of Europe."
The Libyan leader specifically told the Sudanese that they did not need the Muslim Brotherhood to tell them when to pray.
"People here are good Muslims," he was quoted as saying. "I see them praying. What do they need the Muslim Brotherhood for?"

HEADLINE: Book Notes

BYLINE: By Edwin McDowell

 BODY:

A Committed Independent
Seymour Lawrence started his independent imprint in 1965 with only one book on his list, "The Ginger Man," by J. P. Donleavy. But before long he published "Ship of Fools," by Katherine Anne Porter, "Selected Poems," by Jorge Luis Borges, "Slaughterhouse-Five," by Kurt Vonnegut, "Trout Fishing in America," by Richard Brautigan, "Going After Cacciato," by Tim O'Brien, "Little Big Man," by Thomas Berger and "Selected Poems" of Pablo Neruda.
Nearly as impressive as the list, however, is the fact that Sam Lawrence has survived as an independent for 25 years, into the era of merger, consolidation and turmoil. Mr. Lawrence did not entirely escape the turmoil; in 1983, after 17 years of association with Dell Publishing, his imprint fell victim to the economy ax wielded by the troubled management team at Doubleday, Dell's owner. After a stop at E. P. Dutton, Mr. Lawrence's imprint has been at Houghton Mifflin for almost three years, still an independent operator. 
 At a party for Mr. Lawrence last week, given by Houghton Mifflin, a handful of authors paid tribute to him, including Mr. O'Brien, Mr. Vonnegut, Jim Harrison and Jayne Anne Phillips. Houghton Mifflin even invited a bookstore owner, John Evans of Lemuria Bookstore in Jackson, Miss., who was described as probably having sold more of Mr. Lawrence's books than any single bookseller. "Sam," he said, "has given the reader a fine bowl of literary gumbo."
Mr. Lawrence's writers described him as a publisher who is passionately committed to writers and writing, but who is not always tolerant of "misguided reviewers" or the publishing bureaucracy. Joseph Kanon, the director of the trade and reference division at Houghton Mifflin, said in his tribute:
"The first time I met Sam Lawrence, he was making an argument on behalf of one of his authors. The last time I spoke with him (this morning) he was doing the same thing. On both occasions, as usual, he got what he wanted."
 
Life in a Greenhouse
 Penguin USA has acquired "Biosphere 2: The Human Experiment," by John Allen. Biosphere 2 is a futuristic ecological project under way in Arizona, run by Space Biosphere Ventures, a private ecological research company Four men and four women, in a test of a possible space environment, will attempt to spend two years in an eight-story greenhouse that contains some 3,800 species of plants as well as fish, chickens, goats and pigs.
The book, by the director of research and development of Space Biospheres Ventures, will be published as a simultaneous Viking hardcover and Penguin paperback in March 1991.
 
Contracts at Penguin
 Penguin figured in the publishing news in a different way this week when the National Writers Union released a copy of the letter that a group of Penguin authors recently sent to Peter Mayer, the company's executive chairman.
The authors who signed the letter, including David Garrow, Ursula Le Guin, Dan Wakefield, Lynne Sharon Schwartz, Gloria Naylor, Jessica Mitford and Grace Paley, asked the house to begin discussions on changes in book contracts. Their letter noted that the Penguin Group had recently signed an agreement with the Society of Authors and with the Writers' Guild of Great Britain, establishing minimum guarantees for a wide range of provisions in contracts signed with members of those organizations.
Among other things, that agreement said that publishing rights must be renegotiated after 10 years. In the United States, the hard-cover publisher retains publishing rights as long as the book is kept in print.
In a reference to Salman Rushdie, the novelist who is under a Muslim threat of death, the letter to Mr. Mayer added, "The Writers Union has great respect for your company, especially in light of your brave stance in the Rushdie affair -- a stance that the Writers Union was outspoken in supporting."
Mr. Mayer is out of the country and could not be reached yesterday for comment. A Penguin spokesman acknowledged receipt of the letter, however, and said the house was studying it.
 
Vintage Ventures
 Vintage Books has had success with an unusual book recently, and it is publishing another book in an unusual manner.
The successful book is "The Road From Coorain," by Jill Ker Conway, a memoir of the author's childhood on an Australian sheep farm. After a first printing of 28,500 copies last August, there are 77,000 in print and it has been on the paperback best-seller list for two months. Around the Vintage offices, it is known as "The Little Book That Could."
LuAnn Walther, the Vintage executive editor, who acquired the paperback rights from Alfred A. Knopf, said it was the quintessential word-of-mouth book; that is, people who have read it recommend it to friends and often buy copies for gifts. But sales have also been helped by many personal appearances and lectures by the author, a historian who was the first woman to be president of Smith College, from 1975 to 1985. "She's strong and brainy without being apologetic about it, and that's inspiring to her audiences," Ms. Walther said.
The other Vintage title is "Six Degrees of Separation," by John Guare, a copy of which critics will find in their press kits tomorrow night when the play opens in Broadway's Vivian Beaumont Theater. While plays are usually profitable to book publishers over a long period of time, as this one is also likely to be, Ms. Walther said that Vintage had rushed the Guare play into print in a couple of months to coincide with its Broadway opening.

Reagan, the Author, Tours TV Talk Shows

BYLINE: By WALTER GOODMAN

 BODY:
Ronald Reagan is observing the publication of his memoirs, "An American Life," in American style. He is appearing every day this week on ABC's "Good Morning America," where Charles Gibson propels him through his career in five-minute segments. Last Friday, he submitted to Barbara Walters on "20/20." And the next two Saturdays will find him on Channel 13 at 10 A.M., participating in "Two Friends Talk: Ronald Reagan and William F. Buckley Jr." These encounters, which are not so much interviews as ceremonial gestures, reveal as much about the performing styles of the hosts as about the condition of the guest. 
 Mr. Reagan is treated like a well-loved uncle who needs a little help these days in keeping the conversation going. He looks fit; his smile still comes easily, and the unkindest termhe finds for Democrats past is "mean spirited," in reference to Jimmy Carter's 1976 Presidential campaign.
His show business anecdotes are painless, and he genially declines the invitations of Mr. Gibson and Ms. Walters to expand on the reasons for his divorce from his first wife, the actress Jane Wyman. Words, however, do not come easily or always in the right order; when dealing with his time in the White House, he often reaches into past scripts for some phrase that has done proven service.
The phrases he finds are not always directly on the mark of the questions, but no one calls him to task. When Ms. Walters speaks of criticisms that "you walked through the Presidency," he reminds her that he was for two terms the Governor of California, which he notes would be the seventh biggest nation in the world, if it were a nation. He says exactly the same thing to Mr. Buckley. He tells both of them without quite being asked that when he arrived at the White House, he discovered that half of America's military aircraft could not fly for want of spare parts.
In response to references to the budget deficit, which reached grand proportions during his Presidency, he explains to both that the Constitution requires that the President submit a budget to Congress and that he submitted seven of them. Neither Ms. Walters nor Mr. Buckley pursues the point with much energy. He also tells them, with a practiced twinkle, that he received a degree in economics in college. His eight years in office, he informs both, in virtually the same words, marked the longest economic growth period in the nation's history, and in rebuttal to the canard that he favored the rich, he tells both that the top 1 percent of the nation's earners pay more than 20 percent of the total income tax.
Mr. Buckley, like a Samaritan assisting a nearsighted pedestrian across a busy street, hastens to add that that does not take into account the value of the public services rendered to the poor. Well, what's a friend for?
When he cannot come up with a comfortable line, Mr. Reagan tends to flounder, but his questioners are unfailingly solicitous. Ms. Walters plugs his book: "Ronald Reagan's recollections, like the man himself, are humorous and gentle." She manages a chuckle at a remark like "California isn't a place; it's a way of life." She asks, "What makes a marriage work as well as yours does?" She brings up delicate questions, such as the one about his estrangement from his daughter Patti Davis, with apologies. Mr. Reagan is at his most dignified in not taking such bait, and leaves it to Ms. Walters to supply her preferred answer: "It must be very painful today." So experienced is Ms. Walters at her line of work, that it sometimes seems she doesn't need an interviewee at all.
Like Ms. Walters, Mr. Buckley chuckles at Mr. Reagan's little jokes and supplies leading questions to light his guest's way. For example, he explains to the former President that when he asked for a line veto while in the White House, he was not really seeking more power. That is phrased as a question and Mr. Reagan does not take exception.
Compared to Ms. Walters and Mr. Gibson, Mr. Buckley is a veritable Torquemada or even a Mike Wallace, and he disdains to mention broken marriages or disaffected daughters. Yet these editions of "Firing Line" are about as fiery as a couple of armchair clubbies seconding each other's views over their brandies. On the matter of why he insisted on visiting the Bitburg cemetery in West Germany, the former President says he was told that the SS storm troopers buried there had been executed for being kind to inmates. Whereupon Mr. Buckley explains to Mr. Reagan that President Reagan also felt that after 40 years of democracy in West Germany, it was time to make such a visit of reconciliation. Mr. Reagan allows that that is what President Reagan must have felt.
 Left on his own, Mr. Reagan occasionally finds himself in deep syntactical waters. "Well," he tells Mr. Buckley, "you can't have the gross national product (pause) here's a thing for the return to the people and so forth on that without it reflecting those who are paying the taxes." What this means, his friend deduces, is that everyone profited from lower taxes. After listening to Mr. Reagan for a while, even less friendly viewers may accept his explanation regarding the Iran-contra activities, that "I am still one of the ones who doesn't know what really happened."
Given Mr. Buckley's taste for the polysyllabic and the Latinate (he is particularly drawn to "quintile" this time out) and his pleasure in abstract ideas, the conversation takes an odd shape. Mr. Reagan may or may not understand the longer words, but he is plainly most at ease in the first person: his spirits seem to rise as he tells of going to church with Nancy in Leningrad, of a letter he received from a man explaining that anyone in America can become an American, of the lesson he learned when he was a Hollywood star in the highest tax bracket, "Who's going to work for 6 cents on the dollar?"
When Mr. Buckley tries to get the subject onto the endemic problems of the Soviet Union, Mr. Reagan sticks with expressions of confidence in Mikhail S. Gorbachev, based on their personal accord. Tomorrow on "Good Morning America" he allots credit for some of the changes in the Soviet Union to "a kind of chemistry" he achieved with Mr. Gorbachev.
Mr. Buckley, however, goes his airy way. Just before asking Mr. Reagan whether he believes that the United States is providentially blessed and guided (he does), Mr. Buckley says, "So much for the cosmological questions addressed in your book." Neither man chuckles.

BRITISH WARNINGS TO IRAQIS ON WAR

BYLINE: By CRAIG R. WHITNEY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LONDON, Nov. 6

 BODY:
With expectation growing here that the United States is preparing for an attack against Iraqi forces in Kuwait as early as December, the British Foreign Secretary, Douglas Hurd, warned President Saddam Hussein today, "Time is ticking on."
Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher also met today with King Hussein of Jordan in Geneva and told him that she could not rule out force to end Iraq's occupation of Kuwait, British officials said. 
 Mr. Hurd told BBC television this morning that international forces in the Persian Gulf were not yet "at the point of deciding exactly how the military option might be used."
"You do not want to signal your punch in any precise way," he said.
 
Early Attack Dismissed
 When force might be used, if Iraq continues to refuse to pull out without a fight, is something the allies clearly prefer to keep President Hussein guessing about.
Several British officials and military experts dismissed a report circulating among Members of Parliament that an American attack could come even before Thanksgiving, when President Bush is planning to visit American troops in the gulf.
But they also said that sufficient American and British forces, and command and control structures to coordinate them, would be in place for a successful operation by late this month.
Mr. Hurd did not discuss deadlines, but he told the BBC that the international coalition was "approaching the stage when we all take stock and see if the peaceful pressures which we have been constructing are going to be good enough."
 
'Time Is Ticking On'
 Asked if an allied attack against Iraq was imminent, Mr. Hurd answered: "I don't say soon. We keep the military option going; Saddam Hussein knows that it exists; he knows that it is not a bluff; and that is the greatest incentive on him to go in peace."
But the Foreign Secretary added: "I don't think that he can expect to remain there indefinitely. He knows that. Time is ticking on."
Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d, saying in Saudi Arabia on Monday that the gulf crisis was entering a new phase, also reached agreement with Saudi leaders that American forces in any operation against Iraqi troops in Kuwait would be under United States command.
British and French officials here and in Paris have said that they assumed this would be the case for them as well if it came to battle.
 
Sounding Out the Allies
 Mr. Baker talked with Egyptian officials and the Chinese Foreign Minister in Cairo today before leaving for Turkey, and will stop in Moscow before coming here to see Mr. Hurd and Mrs. Thatcher on Friday. His last stop is Paris on Saturday.
Mr. Baker said at the beginning of his trip that he would be laying the foundations for a possible joint military operation against Iraq if the existing policy of militarily enforced economic sanctions did not work. He may also be sounding out his allies on their views of the need for specific United Nations resolutions authorizing the use of military force if sanctions fail.
Asked if Britain thought additional United Nations approval would be needed, Mr. Hurd today repeated earlier Government assertions that it was not required under international law.
The British have sent 15,000 troops, warships, tanks, artillery and squadrons of combat aircraft to the Persian Gulf to reinforce the 220,000 Americans and about as many Egyptians, Syrians, Saudis and other Arabs there. Mrs. Thatcher has said that existing United Nations resolutions would cover any decision to use force to drive Iraq out of Kuwait.
 
Creating a Command Structure
 "December would be a pretty good time," said Francois Heisbourg, director of the International Institute for Strategic Studies, who recently returned from a trip to Saudi Arabia. "I think it would be dangerous to go in in less than two weeks, because I got the sense that they were still in the early stages of putting together an effective command structure."
Air Chief Marshal Michael Armitage, chief of British defense intelligence in 1986-87, writing in The Independent newspaper today, also said the best time for military operations in the gulf was drawing near.
"Statements by President George Bush, as well as by senior British and American military commanders, make it clear that allied preparations for a war in the Middle East are almost complete," he wrote. "The opportunity for military operations will end when the hot season returns in April. If there is going to be military action it has to be before that date."
A Member of Parliament who recently returned from Washington said today that he had found the Administration's mood to be cautious and circumspect. "I saw no evidence of people wanting to start a war," he said. "And if you're going to send in up to another 100,000 troops I think it's unlikely you'll go to war very soon.
"I've always thought that economic sanctions would take at least a year to work," he said. "As soon as Americans start killing Arabs, the consequences will be with us for the next century."

HEADLINE: Moscow Journal;
Soviet Students Study the Art of the Deal, Avidly

BYLINE: By FRANCIS X. CLINES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Nov. 6

 BODY:
Night school has commenced at Moscow State University, and brilliant malcontents are plotting oligopoly and other coups de grace for Communism.
The Soviet nation's pioneer class of M.B.A. candidates in capitalism is hitting once-forbidden books, gratefully absorbing Western economics by the chapterful, the air rife with sugarplum dreams of free enterprise. 
 "The deal is the main thing," Kirill Tkachev confided tersely, putting aside oligopoly's involved concern with the number of market producers and such.
He is a 27-year-old student busy memorizing all the economic models but mainly watching the bottom line, the Deal, at the hottest new curriculum being offered at Moscow State University. It is being devoured by an elite gathering of 62 scholarship students screened from a rush of 1,200 applicants.
"The Deal," Mr. Tkachev said slowly with the sort of glint that used to be faked onto visionary billboard posings of Lenin.
 
Emigre Is the Founder
 He was savoring a simple enriching notion he appears to be learning well at the new Russian-American University, an independent school opened this fall in Moscow State classrooms by Edward D. Lozansky, a Soviet-born physicist and dissident who emigrated to the United States.
The school is running on American contributions and Soviet cooperation, notably from Dr. Yuri A. Osipyan, the physicist who is vice president of the Academy of Sciences and adviser to President Mikhail S. Gorbachev. The plan is to enlarge the school to a full university curriculum within four years, buttressed by a consortium of American universities.
It is an outgrowth of an "underground university" that Mr. Lozansky ran informally in apartments in recent years with Soviet friends after he was permitted to visit his homeland. He found that the current state of Soviet depression cried out for economics as the inaugural discipline.
Previously, the subject of free enterprise was touched on harrumphishly in Soviet graduate schools as a branch of Marxist apologetics under such titles as "the economics of foreign trade." And in recent years there have been more than a few brief, fee-fleecing seminars by visiting Westerners arriving like rainmakers and promising inside knowledge of the free market, currently the Soviet public's main mystique, with the possible exception of U.F.O.'s.
The attraction at M.S.U., where 35 unofficial students are auditing lectures with the privileged 62, is the idea of a full 10-hour weekly curriculum on Western economics dedicated to American M.B.A. teaching methods, free-market textbooks and pragmatic business lessons. In two years, it is to produce graduate capitalists, ready to deal, assuming the nation's economic planners ever catch up with the students' hope for unfettered market dealings.
 
Plotting the Future
 "I intend to become director of a new business firm or start my own if I have to," said 24-year-old Vladimir Shnol. He is a daytime computerware designer and night student who, like most at the new university, already has a strong background in applied and theoretical sciences.
Those disciplines, with their many military applications, had been the major field for ambitious Soviet students until these post-cold-war times of shifting economic gears. Most of the students who made it through the new admission tests already have full-time jobs or avocations in the joint venture and cooperative businesses now permitted as limited market exercises.
In the new university the students see an almost priceless chance to fully switch mindsets as much as careers to Western economics as the discipline of the future. Their only fee is 75 rubles, which in the "real market," the Moscow black market, the new business majors note, is about $5.
The entrance test for the 1,200 applicants was math-heavy and fashioned in part from the type of questions used at screenings for the Harvard Business School, Mr. Lozansky said. The top 200 scorers then were put through an English language examination to produce the freshman class.
"This group already feels pretty elite and has a lot of cohesiveness," said Edwin G. Dolan, an economist and visiting American professor. He finds the students are a high-I.Q., achievement-oriented group that scored the reverse of the average in taking a standard test of entrepreneurial promise, with 85 percent scoring well, rather than the usual 15 percent.
 
A Hunger for Lessons
 The sense in the classroom is one of absolute attentiveness, a hunger for lessons that include such basics of the economics curriculum as the Cournot Model, the Nash Equilibrium and the "prisoner's dilemma." The last one drew students' smiles of appreciation at the once decadent notion of how enterprise advertising can force competitiors to advertise even at the price of reduced profits.
Professor Dolan also mixes in such pragmatic themes as the precise economics of waiting in line, a subject at which the students already are expert.
Pragmatism, not ideology, drives their curiosity, and cautionary lessons on possible drawbacks of capitalist economics are not noticeably appreciated.
"I tried a lesson the other night about the current budget troubles in the United States, and I have never seen so many bored looks," said Katherine Dolan, a political scientist and communications specialist who teaches English courses in conjunction with her husband's economic classes.
Mr. Lozansky said: "I stress that their academic background will be great when they get out of here. But most important of all will be the business contacts they'll be getting in the Western world." He added that the university would award a minimum of 20 internships of up to six months each in the United States.
Even so, the students talk of being most challenged by the idea of staying at home to succeed in what is still largely a contradiction in terms, the Soviet business deal.
"I can see it is necessary to be dynamic," said Mr. Tkachev, a delighted student of the Deal. "To think about business all the time, even when you're taking a shower."

HEADLINE: New Store On 5th Ave. Is Not Just Any Shop; It's Dior's

BYLINE: By ANNE-MARIE SCHIRO

 BODY:
NEW YORK'S first Christian Dior boutique opened to the public yesterday at 703 Fifth Avenue, at 55th Street. But to the city's worlds of fashion and society, it was a bit anti-climactic. More than 400 people had been given a preview of the shop at a champagne reception Monday evening, and 250 privileged guests attended a black-tie dinner later at the Frick Collection on East 70th Street.
Bernard Arnault, the chairman of Christian Dior, along with Beatrice Bongibault, the company's chief executive officer, and Charles Ryskamp, the director of the Frick Collection, were hosts of the dinner and formed a receiving line at the mansion's entrance along with Gianfranco Ferre, the Dior designer. 
 Dior hired Glorious Food to prepare the dinner of caviar, veal and chocolate cake, and brought Christian Benais from France to decorate the garden courtyard with tables draped in pleated white silk and centered with five-arm candelabra twined with white roses.
"Isn't this a rare treat to be here?" asked Cecile Zilkha, who was wearing a black and red Dior dress, circa 1975. "This house is so beautiful."
It was indeed rare for the museum, once the home of the industrialist Henry Clay Frick, to be the scene of a dinner party. "But we're not renting out the house," Mr. Ryskamp said. "We're doing it to call attention to our endowment campaign, to which Dior made a generous contribution."
The Helen Clay Frick Foundation of Pittsburgh has pledged $18.75 million toward the goal of $34 million for the Frick Art Reference Library, and Mr. Ryskamp was hoping the party guests -- among them Carroll and Milton Petrie, Blaine and Robert Trump, Evelyn and Leonard Lauder, the Baroness Philippine de Rothschild, Enid Haupt, Georgette Mosbacher and Marcella Perez de Cuellar -- would get out the word that more is needed.
Editors of fashion magazines and top retailers from stores that carry Dior products rounded out the group, most of whom had toured the boutique earlier in the day. Mr. Ferre pronounced himself pleased with the shop, the third in the United States and the 27th in the world.
The New York boutique is like a little bit of Paris, specifically Dior's headquarters at 30 Avenue Montaigne, with the same gray and white decor, sweeping staircase, crystal chandelier and furniture in the style of Louis XVI. There are 4,500 square feet of selling space on two floors.
"The difference between us and other boutiques," Mrs. Bongibault said, "is that we look French. For us it is very important to be in New York. New York is a special place, an international city. And with the ready-to-wear of Ferre we have the product we want to present.
"In this shop we have space enough to have a large collection and show exactly the look of the runway, with the jewelry, hats, shoes and gloves. It's a way for us to show the complete Dior look."
Jewelry, handbags, scarfs, cosmetics and men's accessories are on the street level, where the brass-banistered stairway with the "CD" monogram on black rails is reflected in a wall of mirrors. On the second level is the main attraction: the women's ready-to-wear from Paris designed by Mr. Ferre, who joined Dior last year to design both the haute couture and ready-to-wear lines.
For the opening, there are clothes from the winter and cruise collections, along with showcases of accessories. The emphasis is on clothes for going out. And they are for women who go to very special places.
The closest thing to sportswear is gray flannel trousers at $1,020. A white silk shirt with a scarf neckline is $1,340. One of the simplest suits, in red wool with a one-button jacket and a button-front skirt, is $2,945. A slim, belted wool crepe day dress with a high neck is $1,885. A pink cotton suit with black buttons is $2,300.
For evening, there are simple sleeveless sheaths in black or pink silk, but that isn't what a woman goes to Dior for. More typical is a black strapless dress with yards of pink satin draped across one shoulder and tied in a bow on the chest ($5,245). Even more luxurious are brocade satin jackets decorated with gold embroidery and beadwork inspired by Faberge eggs ($10,620 and $12,655).
With the New York retail scene in a selling slump, will such rarefied fashion find an audience? Mrs. Bongibault is optimistic. "It is a difficult time," she said, "but it's a cyclical economic situation. We want to be in New York for the century coming."

Lehman Leads New York Issue

 BODY:
Lehman Brothers announced yesterday that it had been chosen by New York City to be the lead manager of the city's $1.3 billion offering of revenue anticipation notes on Nov. 19.
Lehman, which will head a syndicate of 29 brokerage firms for the short-term financing, said the notes have a maturity date of June 28, 1991.
The American Express Company subsidiary said it expected investor demand to be relatively strong, despite concerns regarding fiscal problems the city has experienced because of a shortfall in revenues and weakness in the local economy.
Normally there are expectations on Wall Street regarding the pricing ahead of a major issue, but many firms said that with the offering still two weeks away any speculation about a price would not be realistic. Analysts said the offering might be a barometer of how Wall Street will react to future city issues.
Bear, Stearns & Company, the First Boston Corporation, Goldman, Sachs & Company and Merrill Lynch Capital Markets are senior co-managers for the issue.

HEADLINE: IN THE NATION;
America's Real Deficit

BYLINE: By TOM WICKER

 BODY:
Are you one of those many Americans who regard driving your car as an inalienable right?
Then you should know that the nation needs to double, from $13 billion to $26 billion, its current annual spending to maintain just those highways already existing and bring them up to minimum standards. That doesn't include the $50 billion needed, and soon, to repair or replace 240,000 bridges that might come tumbling down anytime now. 
 Or maybe you prefer to travel in the friendly skies. If so, be warned that about $1 billion a year, over and above another $1 billion of aviation trust fund expenditures, will be needed in each of the next 10 years just to maintain existing flying conditions -- which, despite glitzy airline advertising, are mostly grim to ghastly -- and only minimally relieve airport congestion.
Even if you are one of the above, chances are good that you're also one of the many who believe the recent "budget deal" was necessary -- although President Bush and Congress proposed in that shotgun wedding to reduce Federal spending by $40 billion in this fiscal year and by $500 billion over the next five.
The hard truth is that you can't have it both ways. If you think Federal spending has to be cut, transportation and a lot of other genuine national necessities -- such as housing and toxic waste disposal -- will suffer too. If you want safe bridges, a decent environment and a host of other desirable physical and social effects -- a better educated work force, for instance, and a lower child mortality rate -- then the Government needs to invest more, not less, in American society.
In fact, the Center for Community Change reports that additional Federal spending of at least $130 billion annually is needed to cope with what it cogently calls "America's third deficit" -- the shortfall in the nation's investments to solve or lessen some of its most grievous problems.
The center's cost estimate totaled those of numerous earlier reports by reliable authorities (both private and governmental) on national requirements in various fields. The figures cited for transportation are from the Congressional Budget Office, the General Accounting Office and the Federal Aviation Administration.
A precise price tag on national needs was not the purpose; rather the report seeks to concentrate the national mind on national neglect rather than on the spurious but widespread belief -- enshrined in the misguided budget deal -- that the Federal Government taxes too much, spends too much and borrows too much.
The opposite of the first proposition is true, despite popular myth. The second raises the wrong question -- how much? -- rather than making the right point -- what for? National debt, meanwhile, is growing at about the same pace as gross national product; that's not only reasonable but permits an annual deficit of about 3 percent of G.N.P.
Here are just a few of the yearly unmet needs reported by various reputable studies:
Head Start and early education, $2 billion (Ford Foundation); repair existing public housing, $4 billion (Housing Department and private studies); subsidies for very low income families, $11.1 billion (C.B.O.); education for "at-risk" youth, $5 billion (W. T. Grant Foundation); subsidies for long-term health care insurance, $7.2 billion (Ford).
If all that's too "social" for your hard nose, how about these additional annual costs for neglected physical needs:
Clean up nuclear and nonnuclear military waste, $11 billion (G.A.O. and Energy Department); compliance with Clean Water Act, $2.4 billion (Environmental Protection Agency); clean up non-military hazardous waste sites, $3 billion (E.P.A.).
The report of the Center for Community Change disposes of numerous familiar excuses for these failures. This rich nation isn't taxed too much, for example; total Federal taxes as a percentage of G.N.P. are lower than in 20 other industrialized nations. Nor is all social spending "money down a rathole." Head Start saves an estimated $4.75 in welfare and prison costs for every tax dollar spent, while funded to reach only 18 percent of eligible children; the WIC supplemental food program saves, in reduced health charges, about three times its cost.
That's why meeting these and other needs reflected in America's real deficit would not be "wasteful spending" but useful investment. Nor is it the wallet that's lacking; it's the will.

HEADLINE: Don't Retreat Now on New York City Housing

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"New York City Will Rise Again" (Op-Ed, Oct. 27), Peter D. Salins's attack on the city's housing, health and social programs, is shortsighted and dangerous. 
 In 1987, New York City responded to the disastrous Federal withdrawal from urban programs with a major housing initiative. The city committed $5.1 billion to housing. The funds came from the capital budget, state sources and excess income produced by Battery Park City.
The results are beginning to show. Major complexes of vacated buildings in Harlem, Brooklyn and the Bronx have been renovated, and others are under construction. Families have moved back to these neighborhoods and are joining with the police to patrol their buildings and with parent-teacher associations to demand better schools. The beginnings of solutions are being put into place.
This is the wrong time to retreat. Middle-income families, low-income families and the homeless must have access to decent housing, job training and health care to make the city an attractive place to work, live and even visit.
The state is doing little, if anything, to assist the city in this time of financial crisis. The Federal Government's abandonment of housing resulted in a loss of more than $12 billion in subsidies that could have created new apartments in the 80's.
To New York City's credit, it is making a valiant attempt to solve its most severe problems -- housing, education and crime. The housing policies are paying off. Mayor David N. Dinkins and former Mayor Edward I. Koch deserve our thanks.
Neighborhoods are reviving. The economic crisis has brought down the cost of housing construction, making 1990 the ideal time to continue programs that will end homelessness and bring a modicum of hope to all New Yorkers.

HEADLINE: For Support on Iraq, Syria Gets Lebanon

 BODY:
To the Editor:
In "After the Killing in Lebanon" (editorial, Oct. 20), you seem to mourn the harsh pacification of Lebanon at the hands of the Syrian Army, because the root problem of foreign intervention is alive and well. 
 That the occupation of Lebanon (small and weak) by Syria (a mighty tyranny) was at the request of the Lebanese is only a myth. The Arab League, as well as the Lebanese, had to accept Syria's invasion in 1976, irrespective of whom the Syrian Army sided with.
Successive United States administrations have endorsed Syrian control of Lebanon, for a variety of reasons: there is no oil in Lebanon; United States hostages can only be recovered by Syria, not by a free Lebanese government, and Lebanon was a cheap price to pay to bring Syria to the negotiating table with Israel.
The timing of the final assault by Syria against its detractors in Lebanon (that is, Gen. Michel Aoun), which was almost coincidental with Syria's contribution to the United States anti-Iraqi front, is essentially a reward to Syria. Egypt was forgiven its $7 billion debt; Syria was awarded Lebanon.
If Syria's takeover of Lebanon has not come about by naked aggression, it certainly has been achieved by a subtle combination of destroying the Lebanese infrastructure and finely tuned hostage holding by Syria's pro-Iranian proxies. Syria's Hafez al-Assad has been settling the northern city of Tripoli with members of his Alawi tribe; ask the Sunnis of the city. Syrian Army trucks have carried more loot from Lebanon than the entire Syrian economy has produced in decades. The Lebanese who have been assassinated by Syria's Moukhabarat secret service are beyond statistics, and those who continue to languish under torture and who have perished in Syrian jails have been forgotten even by their loved ones.
On the other hand, those who have not held hostages, who have not resorted to worldwide terrorism, and who have resisted Syria's hegemony have constantly been branded hard-liners and suicidal renegade rebels by the news media and the United States Administration.
It seems proper for the United States to mobilize support of the anachronistic monarchies of Kuwait and Saudi Arabia, but improper to take the principled stance that Lebanon's many struggles were to restore its once thriving democracy and get rid of Palestinian, Syrian, Iranian and Israeli occupations.
I am certainly inspired by your conclusion that the lessons of war have not been learned by the Lebanese, if only it is to show the world that the selling of Lebanon to Syria will not bring about freedom for the hostages, nor change 20 years of Syrian tyranny. The death of Lebanon is not self-inflicted. It is the direct result of Syria's 15-year rape of the country under the watchful eyes of the United States.

HEADLINE: The 1990 Elections: New York - House Races;
Easy Victories For Incumbents In the Congress

BYLINE: By SARAH LYALL

 BODY:
New York's 34 incumbents in the House of Representatives were re-elected yesterday, many by overwhelming margins.
The results seem to have shown that two potential liabilities this year -- a downturn in the state's economy and association with the national budget stalemate in Washington -- apparently carried little weight with voters. While some voters might have been dismayed by current events, they clearly did not blame their elected officials. 
 Both parties held their seats, with the Democrats returning 21 representatives to Washington and the Republicans returning 13. In the New York metropolitan area, most incumbents had an easy time.
In the 6th Congressional District in Queens, the incumbent Democrat, the Rev. Floyd H. Flake, beat challengers from the Republican and Right to Life parties. With 46 percent of the precincts reporting, Mr. Flake had 68 percent of the vote.
 
Got 86 Percent Last Time
 In the last election, Mr. Flake received 86 percent of the vote. His standing may have suffered because of allegations that he had an affair with a church secretary, and because he and his wife face charges that they misappropriated money from Mr. Flake's church, the Allen African Episcopal Church in Queens.
In a closely watched race on Long Island, George J. Hochbrueckner, a two-term Democrat in the 1st Congressional District in Suffolk County, beat the Republican, Francis W. Creighton. With 86 percent of the precincts reporting, Mr. Hochbrueckner had 56 percent of the vote, to 35 percent for Mr. Creighton.
The district has voted Republican in the last two Presidential elections, and the national Republican Party had hoped to field a strong candidate against Mr. Hochbrueckner. But Mr. Creighton entered the race late and suffered from lack of money and poor name recognition.
In the 3d Congressional District, which includes parts of Nassau and Suffolk Counties, the Democratic incumbent, Robert J. Mrazek, beat Robert Previdi, a bank executive from Manhasset who ran on the Republican and Conservative lines. With 93 percent of the precincts counted, Mr. Mrazek had 53 percent of the vote, and Mr. Previdi had 43 percent. It was Mr. Previdi's second unsuccessful bid for Mr. Mrazek's seat.
 
Big Wins in Brooklyn
 Bill Green, a Manhattan Republican, easily won his eighth term in the 15th Congressional District, on the lower half of the East Side. With 53 percent of the precincts counted, he had 57 percent of the vote.
Also in Manhattan, Ted Weiss, a Democrat who has represented the 17th Congressional District on the West Side since 1977, soundly beat William W. Koeppel Jr., a Republican and owner and manager of his family's real-estate firm. Mr. Weiss had 80 percent of the vote and Mr. Koeppel had 16 percent, with 60 percent of the precincts counted.
Brooklyn's four Congressmen, all Democrats, had unusually strong showings with more than half the districts in the borough reporting results. Charles E. Schumer received 78 percent of the vote in his district; Edolphus Towns won 94 percent in his district; Major R. Owens captured 95 percent in his district, and Stephen J. Solarz had 80 percent in his.
The three representatives whose districts include Westchester County -- Nita M. Lowey, a Democrat, and Hamilton Fish Jr. and Benjamin A. Gilman, both Republicans -- were also re-elected, each receiving more than 60 percent of the vote in their races.

HEADLINE: Kahane Suspect Is a Muslim With a Series of Addresses

BYLINE: By JOHN KIFNER

 BODY:
The suspect in the slaying of the Jewish militant Rabbi Meir Kahane emerged yesterday as an elusive, Egyptian-born devout Muslim who kept to himself and worked for New York City repairing air conditioners in the Criminal Courts building.
The suspect, El Sayyid A. Nosair, was a man who left a string of addresses over the last three years, but kept a private post office box in a trading company called The Sphinx in the same building as the mosque he attended in Jersey City. 
 Another Egyptian man who lived at the Brooklyn apartment building listed on Mr. Nosair's city employment records abruptly departed from the building yesterday afternoon, carrying a suitcase, the superintendent of the building said. Law enforcement officials were raiding another address in Cliffside Park, N.J., last night.
The police were unable to establish a motive for the killing yesterday or to say whether it was linked to any organization. Heavily sedated and listed in serious but stable condition at Bellevue Hospital, Mr. Nosair could not be questioned until nightfall. As he came out of sedation, a law enforcement official said, he denied shooting Rabbi Kahane.
 
Police Cite Lone Gunman
 The rabbi, who founded the Jewish Defense League in New York City and became a force on the far-right fringes of Israeli politics until his Kach party was outlawed as racist for its anti-Arab stance, was gunned down in a midtown hotel on Monday night. He had just made a speech to a group called the Zionists Emergency Evacuation Rescue Operation. A bystander was also shot and wounded.
Mr. Nosair, identified by witnesses as the gunman, was in turn shot and wounded by a Postal Service police officer as he tried to flee.
"What we have and all we know is that we have a lone gunman who committed a homicide in New York," Chief of Detectives Joseph R. Borrelli told a news conference last evening.
Pressed as to whether Palestinian or other groups might have plotted the attack, Chief Borrelli said: "I'm going with what I know. And what I know right now is that we have a lone gunmen who committed a homicide."
As the police struggled through the day for leads, Rabbi Kahane was mourned in emotional services by tens of thousands of Jews who jammed a Brooklyn synagogue. And in Jerusalem, security forces were deployed across the city to deter violence as news of the rabbi's death spread, but no widespread unrest materialized. [Page B13.]
A law enforcement official said Mr. Nosair had in his wallet two advertisements clipped from Jewish newspapers: one for Monday night's event, the other for the Annual Jewish Overview Dinner at Le Chateau, 431 Avenue P in Brooklyn on Nov. 18. Also in his wallet were notes written in Arabic, which the police had not yet translated, the official said.
The murder weapon, a Ruger .357 magnum revolver with five shots fired, was recovered, the police said, but its identification numbers had been filed off, making it difficult to trace.
 
Children in Mosque School
 At various addresses yesterday, former neighbors remembered Mr. Nosair as a quiet man with an American-born wife, who had converted to Islam, and three small children. They said he kept to himself.
One important center of his life appeared to be the Masjid al-Salam mosque at 2824 John F. Kennedy Boulevard in Jersey City, which has 300 to 400 members. He had sent two of his children to the Al-Ghazly School, affiliated with the nearby Islamic Center of Jersey City, but the principal, Shaker al-Said, said Mr. Nosair took them out at the beginning of last year, saying he could not afford the tuition of $465 a month.
Another worshiper at the Jersey City mosque was Sultan Ibraham El Gawli, an Egyptian-born travel agent, who was arrested by United States Customs agents on Dec. 18, 1985 on charges of attempting to smuggle 150 pounds of powerful C-4 explosives, 100 blasting caps, remote detonators and a 9-mm automatic weapon with a silencer, to the Palestine Liberation Organization for use in Israel. Neighbors said he had served time in Federal prison and had recently been released.
 
Various Forms of Name
 Immigration and Naturalization Service records show that the 34-year old Mr. Nosair was born in Port Said and took American citizenship under the name of El Sayyed Abdulazziz El Sayyed on Sept. 27, 1989. But over the years, he had used variations of the name Nosir, Nosier, Nosair and Nasser on documents. He entered the country in New York City on July 14, 1981, the records show, and established permanent residency in Pittsburgh on April 7, 1983, when he married an American citizen. He had earned an engineering degree in Egypt.
Police officers who interviewed his wife, Caren Nosair, described her as a convert to Islam who had met Mr. Nosair in a mosque in Pittsburgh and kept "a truly religious household." A police officer said that Mrs. Nosair had not asked where her husband was going on Monday night because "she said she was a true Muslim and they never question their husband."
A spokesman for the New York City Department of General Services, John Beckman, said Mr. Nosair had worked for the city since April 1988 and was assigned to maintain heating, ventilation and air conditioning units at the Criminal Courts building at 111 Centre Street in lower Manhattan, at a salary of between $30,000 and $35,000 a year.
Mr. Nosair was carrying three New Jersey driver's licenses with different addresses, said Jersey City Deputy Police Chief John McAuley.
 
Changing Addresses
 One address was 143 Highland Avenue in Jersey City, a complex with 10 apartments, six of which are occupied by Moslem families.
A resident of the complex, Deborah Ragab, a 39-year-old mother of three, said: "It was a surprise to us, to everybody, if he did it. He was a quiet man. He has three children. He has responsibility."
Mrs. Ragab said she had spoken by telephone yesterday morning to Mrs. Nosair. "She was devastated," Mrs. Ragab said. "She had no idea what happened, she heard it from the news. She hasn't been able to talk to him since."
The family moved from the Highland Avenue address last April. On April 5, Mr. Nosair filed a change of address form at the post office directing his mail to a private postal box at 2824 Kennedy Boulevard, the same address as the mosque.
The box is maintained by the Sphinx Trading Company, which cashes checks and mails money orders for immigrants sending remittances back home. The office is located on the second floor of the building; the mosque is on the third.
Mr. Nosair's city employment records listed his address as 57 Prospect Park Southwest in Brooklyn and a telephone number for his wife as a contact. Telephone directories, however, show that number at that address listed in the name of Ibrahim Elgabrowny.
Neighbors in the six-story brick apartment complex said the Elgabrowny family kept at least six children locked inside Apartment 5C much of the time and that at least one called the authorities to express concern that the children might have been abused.
"Very rarely would you see them all together, but when I did it was like a family of ducklings," said Tommy Jasinski, an unemployed iron worker. "The head of the family first and then down the line."
A friend and neighbor of Mr. Elgabrowny, Fathy Hegazy, who lived with his family in Apartment 5B, was seen leaving the building carrying a suitcase yesterday afternoon, the superintendent, George Steelson, said.

HEADLINE: (Class) War in the Gulf

BYLINE: By John Kenneth Galbraith; John Kenneth Galbraith is professor emeritus of economics at Harvard University.

DATELINE: CAMBRIDGE

 BODY:
The events of these last months in the Persian Gulf have brought to light a problem of the American democracy that all will, I cannot doubt, wish to see corrected once it is fully recognized. Deployed on the sands of Saudi Arabi and facing possible extinction, are young men and women drawn, in the main, from the poorer families of our republic.
We accept that our armed forces, with to be sure many exceptions, attract those seeking escape from an economically limiting family environment, no family at all or the handicaps of minority birth. It is to these, as all have observed, that the television commercials urging enlistment in the services have been directed. 
 Meanwhile it is the more fortunate and affluent of our citizenry who, while rejoicing generally in the rebuke to Saddam Hussein, remain substantially secure in their gasoline, fuel oil and other energy use and thus in their larger living standard.
It is my own good fortune to live in a relatively well-endowed community with an unusually large population of young men and women of combat age. The commitment of these favored young people to the armed forces is not great.
Knowing as one does the depth of the American devotion to democracy, this is not a situation which one can view with comfort. We are, as in the much regretted practice of the Civil War, hiring people from the lower-income classes to do our military service with its possibly heavy consequences. The affluent stand above and apart.
One obvious remedy would be to reinstate the draft with random selection and service on an economically indifferent basis. This would not, I think, be entirely practical; there could be an unseemly reaction.
Instead, let us establish a special volunteer service corps for the duration of the Middle Eastern troubles. These battalions, recruited at the universities and in the better suburbs, and from among the numerous young men and women now or recently at work in Wall Street, would provide opportunity for military service for those now so undemocratically exempted by their wealth or comparative affluence.
Parents who responded favorably to the Middle East initiative would, one hopes, encourage their sons and daughters to sign up. One thinks of possible names -- the Social and Economic Equality Corps, with SEEC as the innocuous acronym. When trained, these volunteers would go promptly into service on the desert sands. A large response to the SEEC would show that we are not risking the lives only of the poor for the gasoline the economically more fortunate consume and, in the words of President Bush, for the "way of life" which those with higher incomes especially enjoy.
A limited response, which is not entirely to be ruled out, would drive home the fact that we are, indeed, asking the poor to protect the rich. In the latter event it would be well that we restrain those who yearn to assail and punish Mr. Hussein by armed force, including those who seek "surgical" bomb strikes and other precipitating military action.
There would still be for those in our present armed forces that not wholly pleasant life on the sand. This, however, would have some of the aspects of any modestly paid occupation. At a minimum, those so engaged would not be getting killed while the economically and socially more fortunate escape.

c-Included an extraordinary reversal of tax loss carryforward of $ 227,000 in the quarter and an extraordinary tax credit of $ 439,000, or 8 cents a share, in the 9 months, and the 9 months also included income from discontinued operations of $ 932,000, or 16 cents a share.
 
There were no share earnings for the year-ago 9 months after payment of preferred dividends.
 
The company said that included in 1990 third quarter results was a profit of about $ 243,000 from the $ 1.7 million sale of the company's country club at its citrus springs community. However, during the third quarter, Deltona continued to experience an increase in delinquent contracts receivable, resulting from the negative publicity caused by the indictment and bankruptcy of major Florida developer, as well as current worldwide economic uncertainties.
 
As a result of the increase in delinquent contracts receivable, Deltona recorded an additional provision to its allowance for uncollectible sales of about $ 5,500,000, impacting net income by about $ 3,549,000.
 
The company also said included in the 9 months figures are losses of about $ 600,000 in 1990 and $ 1,500,000 in 1989 resulting from sales of contracts receivable.

HEADLINE: Sudan's Famine Denials Take Anti-West Tone

BYLINE: By JANE PERLEZ, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: KHARTOUM, the Sudan, Nov. 2

 BODY:
Officials of the Islamic fundamentalist junta here continue to deny that the Sudan faces the possibility of a severe famine, with a strong anti-Western theme as their underlying message.
Dr. Hassan al-Turabi, head of the National Islamic Front, the main financial and political backer of the Government, said in a recent interview in a Government newspaper, "It is a blessing in disguise when people seek to withdraw financial and food supplies to the Sudan." 
 Dr. Turabi was apparently referringto the American decision last month to divert 45,000 tons of a 90,000-ton wheat delivery to protest the Government's restrictions on relief efforts.
The Sudanese Government later stopped much of the obstruction, and Washington went ahead with half of the delivery, but has yet to decide on the remainder.
Officials of the United States Agency for International Development say the Sudan could face food shortages that would leave eight to nine million Sudanese at risk of starvation.
For more than a month, Washington has been asking the Sudanese Government to declare a food emergency sothat Western donors can arrange the months-long logistics of shipping grain to the Sudan and then transporting it within the war wracked and virtually roadless country. the
Western officials say the food shortages will be the result of widespread drought, civil war and the Government's expenditure of meager foreign exchange on arms instead of agricultural input.
The Sudan has been locked in a seven-year civil war between the mostly Islamic Arab north and the largely Christian and animist African south. President Omar Hassan Ahmed al-Bashir accused United Nations officials last month of favoring the rebellious south in their distribution of relief supplies.
The United States and other donors insist that the Government publicly recognize its dramatic food shortage, and implicit in that insistence is the expectation that the Government will then cooperate with -- and not obstruct as it has done this year -- food distribution to areas of need and not just areas of its own supporters.
"We're saying: 'If you don't do this, we won't do this,' " said a senior Western official here. "We're using food as a weapon to feed."
Western officials say they are increasingly concerned about the fundamentalist Islamic takeover here of key Government sectors, including relief agencies.
The board of the Sudanese Red Crescent, a major organization for food distribution, was recently dismissed. A new president who is a member of the Islamic fundamentalist organization, the Muslim Brotherhood, was installed, the Western officials said.
 
Food Shortfall Acknowledged
 The most powerful person in the Relief Ministry, Ibrahim Abu Ouf, a former academic at the University of Khartoum, is also a member of the Muslim Brotherhood. He has told colleagues that for Islam to survive, the Sudan must manage on its own.
Mr. Ouf acknowledged at the United Nations in New York last month that the Sudan faced a food shortfall, but those present at the meetings said he devoted little energy to the question of how food would be brought in. He consistently asserted that the West hadsubstituted Islam for Communism as the favorite whipping boy and said that by harping on the food shortages, the West wanted the Sudan to look bad.
The Minister of Finance, Abdul Rahim Hamdi, has said it was "Zionist propaganda" to suggest the Sudan faced a famine.
In perhaps the starkest exposition of the anti-Western view, Fadlsaed Abu Ghozeiza, an organizer of a national political conference that last month chose Libyan-style popular committees as the new form of political organization, said it was all right if the West did not deliver food or other kinds of aid.
"We'll go back to the donkey," he said in an interview with a Western reporter. "It's easier for us than you. We don't have so far to go back."

HEADLINE: China's Press Casts a Cold Eye on U.S. Vote

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BEIJING, Nov. 7

 BODY:
Eighteen months after Chinese students fought and in some cases died for their vision of democracy, the official Chinese press is taking a jaundiced look at American electoral politics, suggesting that if this is democracy then it isn't really worth fighting for after all.
The newspapers here report that many Americans do not bother to vote and are disgusted with a system in which politicians care only for wealthy special interests. 
 "In that self-professed 'democratic' country, citizens don't want to exercisetheir sovereign rights," People's Daily said today in a front-page commentary. "What a great satire this is! Some people here admire America's 'electoral freedom' even more than the Americans do themselves. I hope that such people recover their senses."
The press had previously mostly ignored the American election. Tonight's television news showed only a brief film clip of people voting but announced no results. The commentary in People's Daily today was only the third reference to the election in the Communist Party newspaper in the last month.
The first reference was a fairly objective account of the campaign, but the second was a dispatch from the official New China News Agency published under the headline "Take a Look at American Electoral Freedom."
It said that for many years, fewer than half of those eligible have voted in Presidential elections and less than 30 percent in midterm Congressional elections. (In fact, the lowest figures in recent decades are 50.1 percent for a Presidential election and 36.4 percent for a midterm election.)
"Electoral participation this time may be lower than ever, because American voters are cold and apathetic, as well as a bit disgusted," the pressagency reported.
"The reason for the indifference," the report continued, "is that there is no genuine electoral freedom in America. Day by day, the people grow more displeased with machine politics and money politics."
Because publicity has been light, most Chinese seem unaware of the American election. And some say they are intimidated by the complexity of the United States' political system. In China, leaders constantly try to conceal the most fundamental disputes among themselves, so some Chinese are puzzled that American politicians go out of their way to magnify differences and insult each other.
There was much more coverage in China of the 1988 American election, partly because it was a Presidential race. The World Economic Herald,which is now banned, even published sympathetic accounts of the 1988 campaign and seemed to marvel that high officials like members of Congress must go before ordinary people and face their complaints.
One reason for the recent criticisms of the American political process may be that Beijing fears invidious comparisons with the Chinese elections that are being held in many parts of the country this year to select "people's deputies." In China, all candidates must adhere to the official line, and in any case the elected councils mostly just applaud the leadership and act as a rubber stamp for its decisions.
"I don't know much about your elections," said a worker in his 20's. "But ours are pretty pointless. We don't know the people on the ballot, and anyway it doesn't matter whom we pick."Today's commentary in People's Daily acknowledged that some Chinese "worship American democracy, to the point that they believe it is a model for a 'free and democratic system.' " The commentary then suggested that even Americans do not much like their system, and cited low voter turnouts and a survey in which more than 70 percent of those questioned felt that members of Congress were more interested in serving special interests than in serving the public.
"Everybody knows that the difference between the two American political parties lies in which fat cats they represent," People's Daily said. "Whichever party, it's all the same thing. That's why it's easy to understand why so many Americans don't support either party, and don't even bother to vote."

HEADLINE: THE 1990 ELECTIONS: STATE BY STATE;
South

 BODY:

ALABAMA
 Two-term Senator Howell Heflin, a 69-year-old Democrat, scored a solid victory over his underdog opponent, Republican State Senator Bill Cabaniss, 52. A generally conservative figure, Mr. Heflin took two notable steps that were welcomed by his state's substantial number of black voters: He voted last summer for legislation against job discrimination, and he came out against Robert H. Bork as a candidate for the Supreme Court.
The Republican Governor, Guy Hunt, 57, won re-election over Paul Hubbert. Democrats contended that Mr. Hunt's campaign had a racial component meant to stir his conservative supporters. The campaign included the airing of Hunt commercials that showed Mr. Hubbert with prominent black political figures. But Republicans argued that the view conveyed in those commercials was not racial but philosophical.
The Democrats retained control of the State Legislature.
 
ARKANSAS
 Bill Clinton, sometimes mentioned as a possible Democratic Presidential candidate, won a fifth term as Governor, beating Sheffield Nelson, a former executive at a natural gas company. Mr. Clinton, who promised to serve his full four-year term, benefited from a bruising Republican primary.
Senator David Pryor, the Democratic incumbent, ran unopposed, and the state's three incumbent members of the House of Representatives all won. In race for the open seat in the 2d Congressional District which includes Little Rock, former Representative Ray Thornton, a Democrat, soundly beat Jim Keet, a Republican State Representative.
Democrats held on to their overwhelming control over both houses of the Legisature.
 
FLORIDA
 Just two years after he left the Senate complaining of "burnout," Lawton Chiles won a decisive victory over the incumbent Republican Governor, Bob Martinez.
Abortion was a central issue in the race. Abortion rights supporters were upset last year when Mr. Martinez tried to have the Legislature place new restrictions on abortions. Mr. Chiles, a Democrat, reluctantly supports abortion rights. Mr. Chiles also won over some voters by limiting campaign contributions to $100 a person.
In another hotly contested race, Representative Bill Grant of Tallahassee was defeated by Pete Peterson, a Democrat who is a retired Air Force colonel. Shortly after his re-election in 1988, Mr. Grant switched parties and became a Republican, a move Mr. Peterson painted, apparently with success, as a breach of faith with voters.
Representative Craig T. James held onto his seat from the Daytona area despite a well-financed challenge from Reid Hughes.
In the race for the seat vacated by Representative Bill Nelson, an Orlando lawyer, Democrat Jim Bacchus beat William Tolley, the Republican candidate who opposed abortion. Abortion was a major issue in the race.
Under Congressional reapportionment next year, Florida could pick up as many as four seats in the House. After Tuesday's voting, Democrats were expected to retain control of both houses in the Legislature.
 
GEORGIA
 Lieut. Gov. Zell Miller, a Democrat, won the governor's race by defeating Johnny Isakson, the minority leader in the State House. The incumbent, Joe Frank Harris, was ineligible to run for a third term.
Representative Newt Gingrich, the House Republican whip who led a revolt against a White House-approved budget compromise, won a surprising narrow victory over David Worley. Mr. Gingrich is considered a major contender for the top House Republican leadership post. [Page B3.]
In another race Representative Doug Barnard Jr., a Democrat, won re-election to an eighth term despite his problems explaining his ties to savings and loan institutions. Mr. Barnard heads a subcommittee overseeing savings institutions, and he accepted $20,000 in contributions from Charles H. Keating Jr., indicted for his role in the savings and loan scandal.
Representative Ben Jones, a freshman Democrat who was an actor in the television series "Dukes of Hazzard," defeated John Linder, a conservative Republican state representative.
Democrats retained control of the Legislature. The state is expected to gain a House seat through redistricting.
 
KENTUCKY
 Senator Mitch McConnell, the Republican, easily beat Harvey I. Sloane, a former mayor of Louisville. Mr. McConnell, a critic of efforts to limit how much candidates for Federal office may spend, raised more than $2 million in campaign contributions this year alone, much of it from political action committees representing companies and industries with business before his committees. Mr. Sloane raised more than $500,000.
Incumbents won all seven of their House races, and the Democrats retained control of both houses in the State Legislature. This could be critical since Kentucky may lose a Congressional seat and redistricting will be in the hands of a Democratic governor and Democrat-dominated Legislature.
 
 LOUISIANA
 Senator J. Bennett Johnston, a Democrat, won re-election last month after a fiery confrontation with Republican David Duke, a 40-year old state representative and former Ku Klux Klan leader who ran without his party's endorsement but picked up 44 percent of the vote in the Oct. 6 primary. Because Mr. Johnston won more than 50 percent of the vote in the primary, no runoff was needed.
In the Jefferson Parish runoff between two black Democrats, State Senator William J. Jefferson, 43, won the Congressional seat opened by the retirement of Democratic Representative Lindy Boggs. Mr. Jefferson, who has served in the Legislature for 12 years, will be Louisiana's first black Congressman since Reconstruction. He defeated Marc H. Morial, 32, a lawyer.
Democrats retained control of the Legislature, which will draw new Congressional districts because Louisiana is expected to lose a House seat.
 
 MISSISSIPPI
 Building on his reputation for assembling coalitions among Mississippi's diverse interests, 52-year-old Thad Cochran won a third term to the Senate, this time uncontested. He was the first Republican this century to win a Senate seat.
Democratic Representative Jamie L. Whitten, who represents the northern Mississippi home country of William Faulkner's writings including Oxford, easily won re-election in the First District, capturing 65 percent of the vote. He has been in the House now for 50 of his 80 years.
 
NORTH CAROLINA
 Despite polls suggesting a much closer race, Senator Jesse Helms easily defeated Harvey Gantt after a nasty Senate campaign. Mr. Gantt, a Democrat and former Mayor of Charlotte, had hoped to become the first black Senator elected from the South since Reconstruction. [Page B3.]
Political analysts said Mr. Gantt had been hurt by Mr. Helms's late television commercials portraying the Democrat as an advocate of racial employment quotas. Mr. Helms apparently also benefited from an unusually heavy voter turnout.
Representative David E. Price, a Democrat, was re-elected despite a well-financed campaign by a Raleigh businessman, John H. Carrington. Another incumbent Democratic House member, James McClure Clarke, was defeated in a close race against Charles H. Taylor, who benefited from growing Republican strength in the western North Carolina district.
North Carolina is expected to add one House seat next year. After Tuesday's vote, Democrats appeared likely to retain control of the Legislature, giving Democrats broad powers over the redistricting.
 
OKLAHOMA
 In a bitterly contested governor's race, David Walters used the 2-to-1 ratio of registered Democrats to Republicans to pull ahead of his opponents. A 38-year-old Roman Catholic, the Democratic candidate supported a woman's right to choose an abortion and took a hard line against new taxes.
The Republican, Bill Price, a former United States Attorney, received 36 percent of the vote, while a dark horse independent, Thomas Ledgerwood, garnered only a small fraction of the vote.
Senator David L. Boren, a Democrat, easily won a third term with a $1 million campaign fund and a popularity that crossed party lines.
 
SOUTH CAROLINA
 Republicans retained control of the Governor's mansion and Democrats kept their hold on both houses in the State Legislature, dividing control of the redistricting process.
Senator Strom Thurmond handily defeated Bob Cunningham, a retired intelligence officer nominated by the Democrats. At the end of his new term, Mr. Thurmond would be 94 years old and the oldest man ever to serve in the Senate.
Representative Butler Derrick, a Democrat, won his ninth term, despite Republican strength in neighboring districts. Representative Liz J. Patterson faced similar problems but defeated Ray Haskett, her Republican opponent.
Gov. Carroll A. Campbell Jr., the incumbent Republican, defeated Theo Mitchell. Race played a role in this election, with Mr. Campbell using his good working relationship with white state Democratic leaders to defeat Mr. Mitchell, who had hoped to become the first black to win a statewide election in South Carolina since Reconstruction.
 
TENNESSEE
 In this state, the anti-incumbent mood was more rhetorical than real. Senator Al Gore and Gov. Ned McWherter, both Democrats, won decisive victories. Mr. Gore beat William R. Hawkins, a Knoxville economist and a Republican, by a margin of 70 percent to 30 percent. Mr. McWherter easily beat Dwight Henry, a Republican state lawmaker.
All nine House incumbents were re-elected, including Harold E. Ford, a Democrat from Memphis, whose trial on Federal bank and mail fraud charges resulted in a hung jury in April. Democrats retained control of both houses of the Legislature.
 
TEXAS
 State Treasurer Ann Richards, a Democrat, narrowly defeated Republican Clayton Williams, a wealthy rancher and businessman, in one of the nation's most rancorous gubernatorial contests. Ms. Richards' victory was considered a defeat for President Bush, who campaigned hard in his home state. [Page B2.]
The race also was important because of redistricting: Texas is expected to gain three seats in 1992, and Democrats retained control of the Legislature.
Senator Phil Gramm, a Republican, easily won re-election in a well-financed campaign against State Senator Hugh Parmer, a Democrat. Chet Edwards, a Democratic state senator, defeated Hugh Shine, a Republican state representative, in the contest to succeed Representative Marvin Leath, a Democrat who is retiring. Representative Bill Sarpalius retained his Panhandle seat despite a strong race by Dick Waterfield, a Republican legislator.
 
VIRGINIA
 Senator John W. Warner easily won a third term, with no Democratic candidate in the race. Senator Warner's only opposition was Nancy B. Spannaus, a supporter of Lyndon H. LaRouche Jr., who was listed on the ballot as an independent and took only a small fraction of the vote.
Stan Parris, a 61-year old conservative Republican, lost his House seat to James P. Moran Jr., the 45-year-old Democratic Mayor of Alexandria. In Charlottesville, Representative D. French Slaughter Jr., a Republican, won his fourth term in Congress by defeating David M. Smith.
In the coming redistricting, which will be controlled by the Democrats, Virginia is expected to gain one House seat.

HEADLINE: THE 1990 ELECTIONS: STATE BY STATE;
West

 BODY:

ALASKA
 Running as an independent, Walter Hickel pulled away from a crowded field to establish an 8-percentage-point lead over his closest contender, Tony Knowles, the Democratic candidate.
Mr. Hickel, as a Republican, was Governor from 1966 to 1968.
The other candidates scrambling to succeed the retiring Governor, Steve Cowper, had similar lengthy political records. Mr. Knowles was Mayor of Anchorage and Arliss Sturgulewski, the Republican candidate, spent 12 years in the State Senate.
John S. Devens, the Democratic nominee for Alaska's sole seat in the House of Representatives, gave the Republican incumbent, Don Young, a tight race, but Mr. Young managed to overcome his opposition.
And Senator Ted Stevens, a Republican, was one of the first Alaskan candidates in this election to raise his arms in victory, defeating Michael Beasley, a Democat.
Marijuana is again illegal in Alaska -- voters passed a ballot measure that rescinds a law allowing private use of the drug.
 
ARIZONA
 J. Fife Symington, a Republican developer, and Terry Goddard, a Democrat and former Mayor of Phoenix, ran a hot and very close race for Governor -- one that may not be over.
Arizona law requires a majority vote, and it appeared yesterday that the number of write-in votes might keep both candidates below the 50-percent mark, requiring a run-off between the Republican and Democrat.
With about 90 percent of the ballots counted yesterday, Mr. Symington led by 4,527 votes. But Karen Osborne, an assistant secretary of state, said there were thousands of uncounted write-in votes for other candidates.
By a narrow margin, Arizonans rejected the designation of the Rev. Martin Luther King's birthday as a state holiday. The Democrats gained control of the State Senate, while Republicans run the lower house.
 
CALIFORNIA
 Dianne Feinstein, the former Mayor of San Francisco, lost the governor's race to Senator Pete Wilson, a Republican who was once Mayor of San Diego. [Page B2.] As Governor, Mr. Wilson may appoint someone to fill his seat in the Senate until a special election is held in 1992.
In an upset, veteran Congressman Charles Pashayan Jr., a Republican, was soundly defeated by the Democratic candidate, Calvin Dooley. But in two other tight races, the incumbents won: George E. Brown Jr., a Democrat, and Al McCandless, a Republican.
Showing their anger with politicians, voters narrowly passed Proposition 140, which prevents state officeholders from serving for more than eight years; it also caps legislators' office expenses and eliminates their once-lucrative retirement benefits. Voters defeated a more moderate proposition to limit terms and also defeated Big Green, an environmental plan that might have cost billions of dollars.
Democrats retained control of the Legislature, which will draw new Congressional districts as California gains several seats in the House.
 
COLORADO
 Republicans successfully reshuffled several seats and retained control of them all. Following a plan used in other states, the party recruited a popular Representative, Hank Brown, to run for the Senate seat left open by the retirement of William L. Armstrong, a Republican. Mr. Brown defeated Josie Heath, a former Boulder County Commissioner.
Mr. Brown's run at the Senate left open his Fourth District seat. The Republican candidate, State Senator Wayne Allard, defeated State Representative Richard R. Bond.
Incumbents in the state's remaining five districts all were re-elected, while Republicans retained control of the Legislature.
The Governor, Roy Romer, never faced any serious competition and easily defeated the Republican candidate, John Andrews.
Voters approved a ballot proposal to limit members of Congress from Colorado to 12 years in office, and state officials to no more than eight years, a law that legal scholars say may not withstand a constitutional challenge.
 
HAWAII
 Democrats, who have dominated this island state's politics, swept all the major offices. Senator Daniel K. Akaka, appointed to fill the unexpired term of Spark M. Matsunaga, who died in April, handily defeated Representative Patricia Saiki, a Republican. The G.O.P. had seen this race as perhaps its best chance to pick up a seat in the Senate. They hoped Ms. Saiki, a Japanese-American, could win a significant percentage of Hawaiians of Japanese descent, a group that tradtionally favors Democrats. But Saiki campaign officials said yesterday that Mr. Akaka had maintained support among this group.
Democrats won both races for the House, wiith State Senator Neil Abercrombie beating Mike Liu, leader of the Republicans in the State House, and former Representative Patsy Mink winning over former State Representative Andy Poepoe, a Republican.
Gov. John Waihee, a Democrat, easily won re-election, and his party retained substantial majorities in the Legislature.
 
IDAHO
 The incumbent Governor, Cecil D. Andrus, a 59-year-old Democrat, defeated Roger Fairchild, a Republican and former majority leader of the State Senate.
Mr. Andrus served as Governor from 1971 to 1977 and as President Jimmy Carter's Interior Secretary from 1977 to 1981 before becoming Governor again.
Earlier in the year he vetoed what would have been a highly restrictive abortion law. For his part, Mr. Fairchild was a declared opponent of abortion before winning the Republican nomination.
With Senator James A. McClure, a Republican, retiring, the race for his seat was between Representative Larry E. Craig, a Republican, and Ron Twilegar, a Democrat and former State Legislator. The victor was Mr. Craig. Larry LaRocco, a Democrat and stockbroker, won Mr. Craig's Congressional seat, defeating State Senator C. A. Smyser.
The Republicans will continue to control the State Legislature.
 
MONTANA
 Senator Max Baucus, a Democrat, easily won a third term against Lieut. Gov. Allen C. Kolstad, a Republican.
Senator Baucus shunned the campaign complacency of his former colleague, John Melcher, who ignored his 1988 campaign until the summer and was defeated by a little-known Republican, Conrad Burns. Mr. Baucus spent more than a year barnstorming the state and raised more than $2 million in his campaign. Mr. Kolstad evoked criticism in the environmentally conscious state last July by calling threats of acid rain and global warming "scare tactics."
Democrats won control of the Legislature.
Representative Pat Williams, a six-term Democrat who was co-author of a compromise measure that continued Federal financing for the National Endowment for the Arts, overcame a challenge by Brad Johnson, a former state party official who is an aide to Representative Ron Marlenee, a Republican who won re-election in the Second District. Mr. Johnson accused Mr. Williams of supporting pornography.
Reapportioning is expected to cost Montana one of its two House seats in 1992.
 
NEVADA
 Bob Miller, a Democrat who became Acting Governor two years ago, easily won his first election to a full term as Nevada's chief executive.
The 45-year-old Mr. Miller, also a former two-term district attorney from Las Vegas, replaced Richard H. Bryan, who was elected to the Senate in 1988. This time Mr. Miller easily defeated Jim Gallaway, a 50-year-old lawyer and former marine, who used his own considerable resources to finance much of his campaign. Mr. Gallaway stressed his "pro-business, anti-tax" stance and criticized the Governor for his anti-abortion position. Mr. Miller drew two-thirds of the vote.
Democrats gained control of the State Senate and held onto the House as well.
In the Second Congressional District, virtually the entire state outside the Las Vegas area, Barbara F. Vucanovich, the four-term Republican incumbent, easily defeated Jane Wisdom, a member of the State Assembly.
 
NEW MEXICO
 With the incumbent Governor, Garrey Carruthers, ineligible to try for re-election, former Gov. Bruce King was the Democratic candidate for the post. In an energetic race, he beat former State Representative Frank Bond, the Republican candidate.
The 66-year-old Mr. King, a rancher and businessman, was Governor from 1971 to 1974 and again from 1979 to 1982. In this year's campaign, he stressed education, the environment and economic development. To spur economic development, he called for steps to create more growth in the state's private business sector.
Mr. Bond, a 47-year-old lawyer and rancher with land interests, also stressed economic policies, calling for various measures to promote diversfied development and create additonal jobs in the state.
Senator Pete V. Domenici, a third-term Republican, crushed State Senator Tom R. Benavides, a Democrat. Mr. Domenici won almost three-quarters of the vote.
The Democrats retained control of the Legislature.
 
OREGON
 Senator Mark O. Hatfield withstood a stiff challenge from Harry Lonsdale, a Democratic businessman, to win a fifth term in office.
Secretary of State Barbara Roberts, a Democrat, will replace Neil Goldschmidt, the retiring Democratic Governor, after coasting to victory over Attorney General David Frohnmeyer, a Republican.
In the Fifth District, Mike Kopetski, a Democrat, defeated Representative Denny Smith, a Republican. Mr. Kopetski fell just 707 votes short of Mr. Smith two years ago.
But Democrats lost control of the State Assembly, thereby losing control of the redistricting process.
A measure to give parents tax credits if they send children to private schools was defeated 2 to 1. So were attempts to toughen the state's recycling requirements, to shut down its sole nuclear power plant, and to regulate land use more closely. Two measures restricting abortions also failed.
 
UTAH
 Representative Wayne Owens of Salt Lake City, who has been the only Democrat in Utah's delegation, defeated a challenge from Genevieve Atwood, a Republican who is a former State Representative.
Another Democrat, Bill Orton, will join the delegation, in the Provo seat left open by Representative Howard C. Nielson, a Republican who is retiring. Mr. Orton, 42 years old, a tax lawyer and first-time candidate, won in what is often called the most Republican district in the nation. He emphasized his conservative ideology, supporting a balanced-budget amendment, a smaller Federal Government and anti-abortion laws.
Mr. Orton's Republican opponent was former State Senator Karl Snow, a 60-year-old professor and administrator at Brigham Young University, who has been the subject of an investigation by The Provo Herald into his ownership of certain stocks and his business association with a convicted felon.
The State Legislature remains Republican.
 
WASHINGTON
 Representative Jolene Unsoeld, a freshman Democrat who was elected to Congress in 1988 by only 618 votes, defeated Bob Williams, a former State Representative, by 13,000 votes. Mrs. Unsoeld's narrow victory two years ago made her a premier target of Republicans in 1990. Mr. Williams accused Mrs. Unsoeld of being a typical "tax-and-spend liberal." She said Mr. Williams was anti-environment and conservative.
In another contest, Representative John Miller, a conservative Republican in his third term representing the First Congressional District in northern Seattle, defeated Cynthia Sullivan, a member of the King County Council. She said Mr. Miller had neglected local problems, including traffic congestion, and voted wrong on environmental issues. But his endorsement by the Sierra Club and the League of Conservation Voters deflated that issue.
Voters overwhelmingly rejected a sweeping environmental measure because, opponents said, they feared losing control over community issues. Voters in the Seattle-Tacoma area also rejected a proposed real estate tax increase to pay for the preservation of open land.
Democrats retained control of the State House and were in a close race to take control of the Senate.
 
WYOMING
 Alan K. Simpson, the powerful Senate Republican Whip, easily won re-election against a political newcomer. He soundly defeated Kathy Helling, a 32-year-old sociology major at the University of Wyoming who challenged Mr. Simpson's positions on economic development and energy policy. The outcome reflected local polls that showed Mr. Simpson to be Wyoming's most popular statewide official.
In Wyoming's sole Congressional district, Craig Thomas, the freshman Republican who replaced Dick Cheney when he was named Secretary of Defense, defeated Peter Maxfield, a Democratic lawyer and former dean of the University of Wyoming Law Schol.
In the race for governor, Mike Sullivan, a popular Democrat, won re-election with a 2 to 1 ratio. His Republican opponent, Mary Mead, is a rancher and daughter of former Gov. Clifford P. Hansen.
Republicans retain control of the Legislature.

HEADLINE: Sakaigawa Journal;
Faster Than a Speeding Bullet, It's Magnet-Train

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SAKAIGAWA, Japan

 BODY:
For as long as Japanese have been riding trains, this country has harbored a dream: downtown Tokyo to downtown Osaka in an hour flat, a 325-mile journey in less time than most weary commuters spend getting to work each day.
Soon that fantasy will begin to roar through the hills of this sleepy town of grape-growers 80 miles west of Tokyo. A few months ago the Japanese Government declared, with some reluctance, that Sakaigawa would be the site of a $2 billion, 27-mile test track for a superconductive magnetically levitated train, a successor to Japan's bullet train. 
 Repelling magnets keep the train running on a bed of air four inches above the track. But no one will be floating on it until well past the year 2000, when the cost of the whole Tokyo-to-Osaka system will rival that of America's planned space station.
But in Japan trains are more than a way of getting people to Osaka, they are a way of getting people rich. And here in Sakaigawa, there seems to be no point in waiting.
 
Pass Through Tunnels
 Months before Sakaigawa was chosen as the site of the test track, and an unlikely one at that, since 85 percent of the trackbed will have to pass through tunnels in the mountains, land prices in this town of 4,400 doubled. There were competing sites for the huge test track, of course, but no savvy investor would look twice.
Little in Japan is coincidental, and the only thing speculators needed to know about Sakaigawa is that it is in Yamanashi Prefecture, the birthplace and home district of Shin Kanemaru. He is perhaps the most powerful politician in Japan, the leader of one of the Liberal Democratic Party's largest factions and one of the aging "dark samurai" known to pull the strings of the Government of Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu.
"We often traveled to Tokyo to ask the Government's cooperation in placing the track in Yamanashi," Tatsuo Takeda, the president of the Chamber of Commerce in nearby Kofu City, said recently, spinning out his vision of how townspeople will one day leave their offices here at 11:30 in the morning and make it through the steep mountains in time for a noon lunch in Tokyo. "But we did not spend much money to attract the project.
"Why spend money," heasked, "if Mr. Kanemaru is here?"
 
Automated Golf Carts
 In fact, it is hard to miss Mr. Kanemaru's presence. The best place to view the test track site is from the hilltop Sakaigawa Country Club, a modern, high-tech resort where automated golf carts follow players across the links.
Mr. Kanemaru, as it happens, is club chairman, and there memberships go for around $160,000. One of his sons, the club management says, is a major investor. And the list of "honorary" members includes many of Japan's powerful, including Noboru Takeshita, the former Prime Minister and a Kanemaru ally.
None of this has stirred the slightest controversy in Japan, where it is accepted wisdom that the choicest pork is the kind that barrels along at several hundred miles an hour. There are legendary stories about how former Prime Minister Kakuei Tanaka arranged for the construction of a bullet train through his home prefecture, bringing sudden wealth to any town influential enough to get a station connecting it to the capital.
In Sakaigawa, Yuhei Fukasawa, the Mayor, is expecting nothing less than miracles, as he often tells Mr. Kanemaru at the club.
 
Taxes and Other Worries
 "We would like to have a residential area, just like Denenchofu," the Mayor said, referring to one of Tokyo's most fashionable. True, he added, some residents are worried about soaring taxes, and more than a few worry about the tracks' enormous magnetic fields.
"I have a few worries myself," he said. "But I am sure they will be alleviated."
No one questions that Japan needs a new bullet train line. The current one, which follows the ancient Tokaido path along Pacific coast from Tokyo to the tip of Kyushu, the southernmost of Japan's main islands, is 26 years old and bursting at the seams.
Its problem is that it is too convenient. Japan's economic boom and a ridiculously overtaxed airport system long ago made the the bullet train the most efficient means of business travel. Now on weekdays it is often hard to find a seat, and on peak weekends, the train often runs at 200 percent of capacity, and people stand in the aisles for hours.
 
The French Rivals
 Moreover, at its top speed of 145 miles an hour or so, it does not seem as fast as it did in 1964 -- especially compared with the 320 miles an hour posted not long ago by the Train a Grande Vitesse in France, which sends shivers through Japan's railroaders.
To minimize embarrassment -- and trim the current three-hour trip from Tokyo to Osaka -- faster trains will soon be put on the old track, despite fears that the bullet train's accident-free record could be jeopardized.
But those are stopgap measures. So long after America dropped out of the magnetic levitation race, Japan kept chipping away at it. And a few years ago the Governor of Yamanashi, Komei Mochizuki, a man who keeps two repelling magnets floating just above his desk, began touting the mountains west of Tokyo as the perfect place for a test track that later could be incorporated into the new line, an inland alternative to the current bullet train's coastal route.
"The advantage of tunnels is that you don't have to purchase the land," he said. "Property rights don't run that deep."
So Japan is embarked on building what may ultimately turn out to be the world's biggest subway system. The risk, of course, is that two cities will become one -- and that Japan, already far too Tokyo-centric, will grow more so.
But eventually Mr. Kanemaru and his fellow Liberal Democrats will no longer have to fight their way to the golf course. Speculators and city officials are already looking for the ideal spot for the station. The smart money, it seems, is within view of the first hole.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Is Moderately Lower; Gold Prices Close Mixed

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar ended moderately lower against most currencies in volatile trading yesterday, bouncing off early lows with a buying spurt prompted by saber-rattling over the Middle East. Gold prices were mixed.
Currency traders sold aggressively on concerns about a United States economic slump, which led to fears that the Federal Reserve would move to lower interest rates to stimulate business activity. Lower interest rates generally diminish the value of the dollar. 
 Also pushing the dollar down were the Democrats' gains in state and Congressional elections on Tuesday. Democratic economic policies are perceived to be more likely to lead to higher inflation, which erodes purchasing power and could make the dollar decline in value.
But heightened fears of war in the Persian Gulf sent the dollar bouncing back. Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher told British lawmakers that Iraq would have to be removed forcefully from Kuwait if it did not leave peacefully.
 
 Dollar Still a Refuge
 "Dealers are still strong believers in the dollar as a refuge during times of uncertainty," said Robert Hatcher, a corporate dealer at Barclays Bank.
The dollar rose against the Japanese yen in New York, closing at 128.73 yen, up from 128.15 on Tuesday. In overnight trading in Tokyo, the dollar fell to 127.55 yen from 127.20 late Tuesday, and in London, it was quoted at 128.15 yen.
The British pound rose to $1.9690 in New York from $1.9657 late Tuesday, and in earlier London trading, sterling rose to $1.9760 from late Tuesday's $1.9635.
Against the German currency, the dollar fell to 1.4874 marks, from 1.4927. And it dropped below 5 French francs for the second time this week, ending at 4.9870 francs, down from 5.0055 late Tuesday.

War Talk Hurts Treasury Prices

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
Hawkish statements on the Middle East, a rise in oil prices and worrisome comments from a Federal Reserve Board governor combined to push down prices of Treasury securities and raise interest rates in rocky trading yesterday.
The session began placidly, with prices inching higher after news reports suggested that the Federal Reserve Board, concerned about weakness in the economy, might lower short-term interest rates again at a meeting next week. 
 But later, market participants were rattled and prices turned lower when warlike statements from a variety of Western leaders, including Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher of Britain, began to appear on traders' computers screens. Those remarks sent oil prices up.
 
 Yield Was Expected
 But bond prices were down only modestly when traders placed bids at the auction of $11 billion worth of 10-year Treasury notes. Dealers said demand was fairly strong, and the bids produced an average yield on the new notes of 8.52 percent, in line with expectations.
The rate, which is down from the 8.77 percent average yield at the last 10-year note sale on Aug. 8, is the lowest yield on a 10-year note since the auction of Nov. 13, 1989.
Shortly after the auction results were announced, traders received another jolt when Lee Hoskins, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland, said in a speech delivered in Akron, Ohio, that it would be a mistake for the Fed to lower short-term interest rates further now because that would probably fuel inflation.
"This is a testing time for the Fed," said Mr. Hoskins, an ardent inflation-fighter. "If the Open Market Committee tries to bring down rates now, it is likely we will revisit the 1970's."
Mr. Hoskins is a voting member of the Fed's policy-making Open Market Committee, which will meet next Tuesday to discuss the economy and monetary policy.
 
 'A Turbulent Day'
 "It has been a turbulent day," said Joseph Liro, a vice president and money market economist at S. G. Warburg Securities Inc. "The Hoskins remarks caused some selling and have put a little bit of a negative cast on the bond auction."
Today, the Treasury is expected to offer $10.75 billion of 30-year bonds in the last leg of its quarterly refunding auctions. In when-issued trading late yesterday, the 30-year bond was offered at a price to yield 8.69 percent, compared with 8.64 percent late Tuesday.
The selling pressure also had a negative impact on the new 10-year notes, which late in the day were offered at a price to yield 8.54 percent, compared with their auction level of 8.52 percent.
Declines in Long Issues
Long-term securities bore the bulk of the price declines in the secondary market for Treasury securities.
By late in the day, the 8 3/4 percent 30-year bonds of 2020 were offered at a price of 100 5/8, down 5/8 of a point, to yield 8.68 percent. Late Tuesday, the benchmark bonds were offered at a price to yield 8.63 percent.
Among Treasury note issues, the 8 1/2 percent five-year notes were offered in late trading at 101 14/32, down 1/8 of a point, to yield 8.13 percent. The 7 3/4 percent two-year notes rose by 1/32, to 100 7/32, to yield 7.62 percent.
Short-term Treasury bill rates were unchanged to down slightly. In late trading, three-month bills were offered at a discount rate of 7.07 percent, unchanged on the day. And six-month bill rates fell by 3 basis points, or hundredths of a point, to a late offered rate of 7.03 percent. Easing Is Foreseen
Despite the market's reaction to the comments of Mr. Hoskins, analysts said pervasive economic weakness made it likely that the Fed would move soon to push down short-term interest rates. Moreover, the inflation outlook is improving, the analysts argued.
"I believe the inflation picture is beginning to look much better, due to lower non-oil commodity prices and the slowdown in wage gains that we have seen," said Edward J. Hyman Jr., vice chairman of C. J. Lawrence Morgan Grenfell.
Maria Fiorini Ramirez, president of Ramirez Capital Consultants, said, "I don't think Hoskins represents the majority view" on the Open Market Committee. Now, Mrs. Ramirez said, "concerns about the economy are more important than worries about inflationary pressures."
In the secondary market for investment-grade corporate bonds, participants said that prices of most issues were narrowly mixed.
More New Issues
No new issues of corporate bonds were priced yesterday, but fresh figures from Moody's Investors Service showed that such issues picked up during October.
Last month, new corporate issues rated by Moody's amounted to $6.6 billion, up sharply from the $4.87 billion in new issues during September and $3.83 billion in August. Despite the pickup, October's total was only about half the $12.5 billion issued in October 1989, and was about 4 percent below 1990's year-to-date monthly average, Moody's said.
In the secondary market for tax-exempt municipal bonds, traders said that prices of most widely quoted issues ended down by about 1/8 of a point after moving higher early in the day.
Following are the results of yesterday's auction of 10-year Treasury notes:

Times to Sell 3 Papers

 BODY:
The New York Times Company said yesterday that it had reached a preliminary agreement to sell three of its regional newspapers to the American Publishing Company, based in West Frankfort, Ill.
Two of the papers are dailies in eastern Kentucky: The Middlesboro Daily News and The Harlan Daily Enterprise. The third, The Claiborne Progress, is a weekly in New Tazewell, Tenn. 
 The newspapers, which have a combined circulation of 21,000, were acquired by the Times Company in 1982, along with a number of other papers. The sale price was not disclosed.
John R. Harrison, president of The New York Times Company Regional Newspaper Group, told employees of the Middlesboro paper on Monday that a review begun last year of all the regional newspapers concluded that the three papers being sold would not provide an adequate return on investment in the current economic climate. He also said no other papers were on the market.
All three newspapers have been profitable and have performed up to expectations, according to Nancy Nielsen, a spokeswoman for The Times. "They are too small for a group our size," she said.
The company owns 32 other regional newspapers in California, Maine and a number of Southern states.
American Publishing operates 65 papers in 27 states. It is a subsidiary of Hollinger Inc., a Toronto-based company that owns 181 publications worldwide.

HEADLINE: Market Place;
Seeking Safety In Money Funds

BYLINE: By Floyd Norris

 BODY:
THE risk-averse buyers of money market funds are turning increasingly to the safest of such funds, giving up slightly higher yields for the safety of funds that are invested only in United States Government securities.
"There's a real flight to safety," said Hank Schmelzer, an executive vice president of New England Securities. "It shows the level of concern with what is going on." 
 Most of the cash in money market funds remains in those that have the option of investing in a wide variety of assets, including bank deposits and commercial paper, which are short-term loans to corporations. But those funds have been losing market share rapidly this year to funds that buy only Government securities.
The most restrictive of those funds, which buy only Treasury bills, had $26.7 billion in assets this week, up 70 percent from the end of last year and an increase of $653 million in the past week, IBC/ Donaghue's Money Fund Report said yesterday.
Assets of funds that are only slightly less conservative, investing in securities issued by Government agencies as well as in Treasuries, grew by 43 percent over the period, the report said.
By contrast, the assets of the broader group of funds that invest in the entire range of securities have risen just 12 percent in the period.
It is likely that the increased investment in the most conservative money market funds reflects growing public fear over the fragility of the financial system and worries about possible corporate defaults. But it has also come at a time when interest-rate differentials between funds have narrowed, meaning that relatively risky funds offer less of a yield advantage than they did formerly.
The surge in investments in Treasury funds may also be partly the result of nervous investors taking money out of bank accounts. Money market funds are used by many investors as substitutes for bank accounts, with many providing check-writing privileges.
By investing only in short-term securities, money-market funds are designed to assure that investors never take a capital loss. But losses are possible if a security held by a fund defaults.
There have been two significant defaults of commercial paper issuers whose securities were held by money market funds. The first default was by Integrated Resources Inc. in June 1989 and the second was in March, when Mortgage and Realty Trust was unable to meet its obligations. In each case, the fund sponsors made up the loss rather than allow the defaults to affect their customers.
Following those defaults, funds began culling securities that do not have the highest rating of the bond-rating agencies. That trend has been accelerated because of a rule proposed by the Securities and Exchange Commission that no fund may invest more than 5 percent of its assets in securities not rated top grade.
Martha Wittbrodt, the editor of IBC/Donaghue's Money Fund Report, said that 19 money market funds in June did not qualify for that publication's highest quality rating because they invested in paper that was not ranked in the top two grades by at least two rating agencies. Now there are two, she said.
One result of the flight to quality by fund managers has been that the spread of money market yields has narrowed. At the end of May, the average 30-day simple yield for all taxable money market funds, as computed by IBC/Donaghue, was 7.68 percent, 28 basis points higher than the rate on the average money market fund that invests only in Treasury securities. A basis point is one hundredth of a percentage point. By the end of September, that spread had fallen to 17 basis points. Since then, however, it has been growing again as some less creditworthy borrowers have been forced to pay higher rates. As of Monday, the spread was back to 23 basis points.
If that spread continues to widen, it will serve as an indication that concerns over credit quality are growing, as relative rates rise on all assets that lack an explicit Government guarantee. It will also make it more tempting for money market fund investors to give up a little safety in the hope of getting a higher yield.

HEADLINE: Bush Administration Is Split On Taiwan's Joining GATT

BYLINE: By CLYDE H. FARNSWORTH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 7

 BODY:
The Bush Administration is divided over a long-pending application by Taiwan to join the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, the 100-nation agency that oversees global trade.
Taiwan's bid to join GATT is strenuously opposed by China, whose application for membership was put on hold after the June 1989 massacre of students at Tiananmen Square. The State Department is siding with China, unwilling to risk its support on several foreign policy fronts. One of five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council, China voted to impose sanctions against Iraq after its invasion of Kuwait on Aug. 2. 
 But Taiwan's application has the enthusiastic support of the United States Trade Representative, Carla A. Hills, as well as the major committees of trade and foreign affairs of the Senate and the House of Representatives.
"We have a unique opportunity to bring under GATT discipline one of the last major market-price-based trading entities outside the GATT system," Mrs. Hills said in a letter to the House Ways and Means Committee. She added that the admission of Taiwan would "greatly benefit U.S. commercial and trade policy interests and the international trading system as a whole."
 
 Baker Urges Caution
 Taiwan, the world's 13th-largest nation, as measured by trade, is the fifth-largest American trading partner. By joining GATT, Taiwan would accept obligations to comply with internationally agreed-upon trading rules. For example, it would be obligated to take steps to open its markets.
The Government of Taiwan has promised to provide $1 billion in aid to developing nations should it be admitted to GATT.
Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d, in a letter to the Ways and Means Committee, said that while Taiwan's membership may be "desirable in principle," the "political questions involved require careful consideration."
The State Department said that some American allies share Mr. Baker's concerns, but it declined to name those nations.
Beijing has been supporting the Bush Administration's search for a peaceful settlement in Cambodia and Washington's position in the Persian Gulf crisis.
On Capitol Hill, Mr. Baker has opened the Administration to further charges of being soft on China.
Citing continued restrictions on political dissent in China, many lawmakers have been critical of the Administration's decision last spring to extend trade concessions to China for another year. The House voted overwhelmingly last month to take away those benefits; the Senate did not act, so the benefits continue.
 
 Lack of Atonement
 The House also approved an amendment sponsored by Representative Philip M. Crane of Illinois, urging the President to consider, in granting any new concessions to Beijing next year, the extent to which Beijing has moderated its position on Taiwan's GATT membership.
A senior Republican on the Ways and Means Committee, Mr. Crane argues that because of China's lack of atonement for the Tiananmen massacre and the enormous strides made by Taiwan in promotion of freedom and democracy, "we can no longer tolerate the Chinese Government dictating to us what our policy toward Taiwan ought to be."
China's position is that it is the legal government of Taiwan, which it views as part of China.
"The Taiwanese authorities have no right for accession to GATT on their own," said Li Songlin, chief of the public affairs office at the Chinese Embassy here. "Only after China resumes its status as a contracting party to GATT and with approval of the Chinese Government will it be possible to consider the question of Taiwan's application."
 
 Economic Motive Cited
 Sensitive to the objections from Beijing, Taiwan applied for GATT membership in January not as a sovereign government, but as the "Customs Territory of Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen and Matsu," all islands off the Chinese mainland. They were taken over when Chinese Nationalist forces of President Chiang Kai-shek withdrew from the mainland after the Communist takeover in 1949.
Taiwan officials say they have received favorable responses on the membership application from "nearly all GATT members."
A brochure issued by Taipei says the objective of GATT membership is "entirely economic," adding that "the territory has no wish to provoke or antagonize Mainland China through its GATT application."
Jeremy Shen, an economic officer at the Coordination Council for North American Affairs, which represents Taiwan in the United States, explained that because of Taiwan's growth as a trading power, GATT membership has become "an urgent matter."
Although Taiwan's trading regime conforms in many respects to GATT standards, the trade benefits it has granted and received over the years have all come through onerous bilateral negotiations.
But because its trading relations have become so extensive, the bilateral approach no longer meets Taiwan's needs, Mr. Shen said. Taiwan does business with more than 140 countries and trading areas. Its international trade totaled $118 billion in 1989 and its foreign reserves have grown spectacularly, to $60 billion.

HEADLINE: War Talk Pushes Oil To $35.31

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD

 BODY:
Spooked by tough talk from Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, the price of oil rose sharply yesterday. Traders also cited a variety of colorful rumors and further speculation about war.
Crude oil for delivery next month closed at $35.31 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange, up $2.68, its sharpest gain in two weeks. 
 Oil products also jumped, with heating oil for December delivery gaining 6.33 cents, or $2.66 a barrel, to close at 92.71 cents a gallon, and unleaded gasoline rising 3.44 cents a gallon, to 91.19 cents.
The biggest factor in the oil gains was said to be a speech by Mrs. Thatcher on the floor of Parliament in which she issued a warning to Iraqi President Saddam Hussein. "The implacable message of this House," she said, "must be: Either he gets out of Kuwait soon or we and our allies will remove him by force and he will go down to defeat with all the consequences. He has been warned."
 
 'A Matter of When'
 Whatever the reaction in Baghdad, oil traders in New York took notice, as did the stock and bond markets. The Dow Jones industrial average tumbled 44.31 points, to 2,440.84, and the benchmark 30-year bond fell and its yield climbed. [Pages D10 and D12.]
"The consensus is, it's just a matter of when we're going to war," said Peter Beutel, of the Pegasus Econometric Group, of Hoboken, N.J. Of the impact of the saber rattling on the oil market, he said, "We've heard it from our own Administration so many times that people on the trading floor were getting tired of it." But from Mrs. Thatcher, he said, it was new.
At the Institute for International Economics in Washington, Philip K. Verleger Jr., a visting fellow and commodities market expert, said, "The British seem to be the stalking horse for this thing."
"Logically, it's better to have someone else making the threats," he said. "Mrs. Thatcher's better at it than George Bush, and it's deniable; we can say, she was speaking for the British and not speaking for us, and it has the desired effect."
Some traders said President Bush appeared to have a freer hand now that Election Day has passed.
The trend in the market had been generally lower in the last few days, with oil actually dropping more than $2 on Monday after reports that production had returned to the level prevailing before the embargo was imposed against Iraq and Kuwait in early August.
 
 Red Adair Rumor
 But Stephen P. Piaso, a trader at Lehman Brothers, said after yesterday's close that "the war premium has returned to the market." Oil experts say that if supply and demand were the only factors, the oil price would be in the mid- to high-$20's, but that fear of war has pushed it higher.
Late in the trading session yesterday a rumor crossed the floor that the Pentagon had hired Red Adair, whose company extinguishes oil fires and caps blowouts, to go to Saudi Arabia to evaluate safety there. A switchboard operator at the Red Adair Company in Houston, who would not identify herself, said the company had had several calls asking about the rumor but had no comment.
Another rumor was that James A. Baker 3d, the Secretary of State, who was in Turkey and Moscow, yesterday, had sent a message to Mr. Hussein through the Chinese foreign minister that if Iraq did not pull out of Kuwait within two weeks, the United States would go to war. Mr. Baker denied it.
And finally, the market, which in the past has moved sharply on reports of Saddam Hussein's dreams, took its cue in part from the phases of the moon. Traders said that the new moon this weekend represented a window of opportunity for military action, with dark conditions favoring the United States.
 
 Worst-Case Estimates
 But several traders said that if war did come, their estimate of how high prices would rise was lower now than it had been earlier in the crisis. Nauman Barakat, at Merrill Lynch, said, "It will be very difficult for Saddam to take out the Saudi export facilities. Even if war were to break out, the runup won't be much more than to $50 or $55" in the price of oil.
"There is a considerable school of thought that the day war breaks out, you've got to sell the market because the worst case scenario has materialized," he said. "If the export facilities aren't damaged, then the market has seen the top."
Mr. Beutel said that fear of war had already pushed the market up substantially without any shooting. He referred to the possiblity that an actual war would not push prices higher as the "all-dressed-up-with-no-place-to-go scenario."

Allies Tell Baker Use of Force Needs U.N. Backing

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ANKARA, Turkey, Nov. 7

 BODY:
Midway through Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d's tour of Europe and the Middle East, it has become clear that Washington's partners in the coalition against Iraq will not consider using military force unless it is authorized by the United Nations, American officials said today.
The officials said the Turkish Government added its voice today to those of the Bahrainis, the Kuwaitis, the Saudis, the Egyptians and the Chinese, with whom Mr. Baker met at earlier stops, saying that if the United States wanted to maintain the international consensus against Baghdad it must obtain the approval of the Security Council before undertaking any offensive military action. 
 A senior State Department official, briefing reporters after Mr. Baker's meetings with the Turkish leadership, said, "The reaction we are getting at every stop is that people agree on the centrality of the international consensus aligned against Saddam Hussein.",
"As we move forward," he said, "you want to maintain the international consensus to the extent possible and certainly further United Nations action would be a good measure of that continued international support."
 
Baker Heads for Moscow
 The Secretary of State left Ankara late today for Moscow, where he will try to persuade the Soviets to support United Nations authorization for a strike against Iraqi forces, if sanctions alone cannot dislodge them from Kuwait. After Moscow, Mr. Baker goes to London and Paris.
The senior State Department official said that while the Bush Administration insisted that, legally, it already has the right to use force under Article 51 of the United Nations Charter, for political reasons it will need to go to the Security Council for specific authorization.
Article 51 stipulates that a member of the United Nations can ask other members for help in resisting aggression against its territory. Article 42 allows the Council to order "action by air, sea or land forces" to enforce an embargo.
"Legally," the senior official said, "our position and the position shared by others is that Article 51 provides a sufficient basis under international law for further action."
But he added that a Security Council resolution authorizing some specific military action "would provide a firmer political basis," as had a Council resolution authorizing navies to interdict Iraqi shipping.
 
U.N. Action This Month Hinted
 "I think the idea is to try to maintain that international political consensus to the extent that you can, as you move further along into this crisis, " he said, "because it is the international solidarity in all its measures that is intended to have the effect on Saddam that would lead him to realize that the best means out is a peaceful withdrawal."
The official strongly hinted that the Administration would try to push through some type of United Nations authorization for the use of force this month, when Thomas R. Pickering, the American delegate, will take his turn as President of the Security Council. Whoever is President of the Council has a great deal of influence over its agenda.
"I think action at the United Nations Security Council during the course of the U.S. presidency is one of the issues being discussed at all of these stops," the official said. "I think we would want to have a good month in our term as President of the Council. Certainly we want the gulf to be the focus of our efforts."
Judging from what President Turgut Ozal of Turkey told Mr. Baker, the Iraqis will not be leaving Kuwait soon. Mr. Ozal, the State Department official said, informed Mr. Baker that while the sanctions were indeed pinching the Iraqi economy, Turks in Baghdad had reported that the pain was not enough to "alter Saddam's political calculations and lead him to withdraw peacefully."
"We are obviously not yet to that point," the official added.
Turkish Foreign Ministry officials were quoted as saying that Mr. Baker did not bring up the idea of Turkey's opening up a second front against Iraq, along their common border. President Ozal dismissed the idea as nonsense earlier in the week.
 
'Turks Are Pragmatic'
 American officials say the Turks are concerned that a war that devastated the Baghdad Government could lead to the breakup of Iraq and leave Turkey with a huge, fragmented country on its eastern border.
Turkey is also wary about taking actions against Iraq that will create permanent enmities between the two nations.
While the Turks have abided by the United Nations sanctions, losing an estimated $7 billion in revenues and remittances as a result, the coalition has not fulfilled its promises of economic aid except for $300 million from the Kuwaitis. Turkish officials made that point repeatedly to Mr. Baker.
"Some people say Turkey was too keen to join the sanctions and create a dangerous enemy out of Saddam Hussein," Ilnur Cevik, a columnist for The Turkish Daily News, wrote. "Turks are pragmatic. We know very well that when the gulf crisis is over and the marines pack their bags and go home, we will be left on our own to deal with its legacies. Therefore, we would like to remind them of these facts so that they too expect no more than what we have done so far. We do not want to be dragged into any military adventure."

U.S. Aide Arrives in Syria for Talks on Gulf

BYLINE: REUTERS

DATELINE: DAMASCUS, Syria, Nov. 7

 BODY:
Assistant Secretary of State John H. Kelly arrived unexpectedly in Damascus today for talks with Syrian leaders on the Persian Gulf crisis, officials said.
Mr. Kelly is accompanying Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d on a tour of the region. Officials said he would meet with the Syrian Foreign Minister, Farouk al-Sharaa.
Diplomats expected Mr. Kelly to face tough questions from Syria on increased American military and economic aid to Israel since the outbreak of the Persian Gulf crisis.
Syria became Washington's unlikely ally in the gulf crisis when it sent troops to join a United States-led multinational force in Saudi Arabia.
Officials said today that the Foreign Ministers of Egypt and Saudi Arabia, Esmat Abdel-Meguid and Prince Saud al-Faisal, would come to Damascus on Friday to discuss with Mr. Sharaa how to form a united Arab front against Iraq's occupation of Kuwait.
"The ministers are expected to reiterate that a peaceful settlement of the gulf crisis could never be achieved unless Iraq unconditionally pulls its forces out of Kuwait and the Kuwaiti Government is reinstated," an official said.

HEADLINE: The 1990 Elections: Signals - The Message;
The Big Vote Is for 'No'

BYLINE: By R. W. APPLE Jr.

 BODY:
The nation's voters didn't much like the choices presented to them in Tuesday's midterm elections.
Only a third of those eligible to do so even bothered to cast ballots. On the face of it, those who did liked incumbents best, as long as they worked far away -- on Capitol Hill, not in the state capital. But while only one senator and about 15 representatives were unseated, dozens of others got the scares of their lives, and scores found their accustomed margins of victory cut. 
 Evidently unhappy with politics as usual, the voters liked independent candidates, beholden to neither party. They liked proposals that would limit the terms of legislators. They liked straight arrows and arrows once bent, now trying to straighten out.
They were less consistently enthusiastic about women and blacks as candidates. They were hostile to some, but not all, candidates and initiatives that they thought had cost them money or were likely to. With one big exception, they disliked people they found extreme in style or viewpoint, and they were put off by most candidates bearing the scent of scandal.
They were impressed by some big names but unimpressed by some of the very biggest, like George Bush and Mario M. Cuomo and Bill Bradley.
 
Dilemma for the Governors
 What they liked least was incumbent governors, those highly visible people who often face the dilemma, in these straitened times, of cutting services or raising taxes, with Washington providing less help than ever and asking the states to do more than ever to look after the unfortunate.
In the confusing welter of returns, those were the most evident of many patterns. By its very nature this midterm election was an imperfect national referendum, often dominated by personalities and local circumstances rather than overarching issues, full of exceptions and contradictions.
For Mr. Bush, who appeared at no fewer than 115 Republican fund-raising events this year, it was a bad day because he lost the governorships of two states that he coveted, Florida and Texas, and because his party's already feeble position on Capitol Hill was further weakened. A poll of voters who had just cast their ballots, taken by Voter Research and Surveys, showed that Republican House candidates lost the backing of about a third of the voters who said they had voted for Mr. Bush or for his predecessor, Ronald Reagan.
The poll also indicated that Democrats and Republicans split the white vote and the votes of men in the House races, which meant that women, blacks and Hispanic voters were crucial to Democratic success. Interviews for the survey were carried out across the country and involved 17,770 voters.
 
No Democratic Nirvana
 Mr. Bush could claim extenuating circumstances as he pondered the outcome, including the difficulty that almost all Presidents have faced in influencing the course of midterm elections, and the ineptitude of the Republican candidates in Texas and Florida, which wasn't the President's fault.
The final results hardly represented nirvana for the Democrats, either. They lost the biggest bonanza of them all, California, and they saw the Republicans sweep the contests for governor across a broad stretch of the still-pivotal Middle West -- Ohio, Michigan, Illinois, Iowa, Wisconsin, Minnesota -- one of the regions of the country where Presidential elections are won or lost.
Before the balloting on Tuesday, voters had told poll-takers and reporters and politicians themselves that they were disgusted, fed up, turned off.
But many of those voters said they liked their own Congressman or Senator, even if they found most politicians unpalatable. In the event, the power of incumbency for those on Capitol Hill proved considerable even in the face of populist rumblings. About 96 percent of House and Senate incumbents were re-elected; not many of the rascals were thrown out, for all the hulabaloo.
 
Some Shrinking Margins
 Of the 406 members of the House who won re-election, a tentative tabulation by The New York Times indicated, 102 of them -- about a quarter -- did so with less than 60 percent of the vote. Average margins were bigger in 1988 and 1986, about the same in 1984.
But there were a lot of close calls, for Representative Bill Dickinson of Alabama, a thoroughly entrenched Republican, who got 51 per cent this time and 94 per cent in 1988, and Representative Carl Perkins of Kentucky, a solidly established Democrat, and Representative Olympia Snowe of Maine, a seemingly secure Republican, both of whom barely scraped through to victory.
Of those House incumbents who actually lost, many did so because of scandals of various kinds. Representative Roy Dyson of Maryland, a Democrat, was linked to Defense Department scandals. Alleged sexual improprieties defeated Representatives Arlan Stangeland, a Minnesota Republican, and Jim Bates, a Democrat from California.
The multifaceted savings-and-loan scandal, which many had thought too complex for voters to understand, claimed a number of victims: Representatives Charles Pashayan Jr., a Republican, and Douglas H. Bosco, a Democrat, both from California, and Representative Denny Smith of Oregon. Two other Democrats, Representatives Frank Annunzio of Illinois and Doug Barnard Jr. of Georgia, both survived attempts to implicate them. Mr. Bates and Mr. Bosco held out hopes that absentee ballots, still to be counted, might save their seats.
 
Clean Is In
 A poll of voters in Ohio showed that Sen. John H. Glenn Jr., one of the five senators linked to Charles H. Keating Jr., the failed savings-and-loan tycoon, might have had trouble if his name had been on the ballot; 18 percent of the respondents said he should resign now, and 39 percent more said he should not seek re-election in 1992.
The other side of that same trend was the success of candidates seen as clean-cut, like William F. Weld, the boyish Brahmin Republican who was elected governor of Massachusetts, and Senator Pete Wilson of California, elected governor there, who described himself to a reporter not long ago as "a white bread kind of politician."
Lowell P. Weicker Jr. and Walter J. Hickel, both running as independents outside normal partisan combat, were elected governor of Connecticut and Alaska, respectively. Arne Carlson, a soft-spoken Republican who only re-entered the Minnesota governor's race in the final two weeks, was a similar case.
The exception was Senator Jesse Helms of North Carolina, a Republican who ran a typically bare-knuckle campaign in which some detected racism.
 
Overcoming Problems
 Lawton Chiles, the governor-elect of Florida, has had problems with depression. Ann Richards, the governor-elect of Texas, who is the first liberal Democrat since Ralph Yarborough more than two decades ago to score a victory of comparable scope there, has fought a long battle against alcoholism. But both found ways to look squeaky clean, Mr. Chiles by spurning big campaign contributions, Ms. Richards by branding her rival as a mudslinger.
The survey of voters in Texas showed that 26 percent considered the Republican campaigner, Clayton Williams, the dirtier campaigner, as against 23 who thought Ms. Richards had earned that description, and 24 percent thought the two were equally dirty -- a narrow margin, but Ms. Richard's victory was narrow, too.
Ms. Richards was one of three women elected governor, but Dianne Feinstein, the Democratic nominee in California, lost, and Gov. Kay Orr of Nebraska, a Republican, failed in a re-election bid. Highly regarded Republican women in Congress from Rhode Island, Illinois and Hawaii, failed to unseat Democratic senators, and each of them was replaced in the House by a man.
 
Respected, but Defeated
 Harvey Gantt of North Carolina failed in the bid that would have made him the Senate's only black member, and two of three black Republican candidates for the House, all well thought of, also lost.
Taxes and the budget battle hurt a lot of people, starting with Mr. Bush himself and including Republican representatives who backed the budget deal, such as Peter P. Smith of Vermont and Jack Buechner of Missouri.
Nor did the Republican leadership of the House, which got itself into a tactical tangle during the budget deadlock, emerge unscathed. Representative Robert H. Michel of Illinois, the majority leader, was unopposed, but his number two, Representative Newt Gingrich of Georgia, won by fewer than 1,000 votes in a supposedly safe district, and Representative Guy Vander Jagt of Michigan, head of the campaign committee, was held to an unusually low 55 percent.
Term-limitation measures, implying lack of confidence in the system, passed in Colorado and California and Kansas City; environmental initiatives, indicating willingness to spend money for intensified government action, were beaten in California, New York and a number of other jurisdictions.
Senator Bill Bradley, Democrat of New Jersey, apparently taken as a surrogate for Gov. Jim Florio, who pushed through record tax increases, barely survived, as did three House members in the state. Exit polls showed that taxes and the economy were major factors on the voters' minds.
But the pattern was uneven, here as elsewhere. Jim Edgar, a Republican who said he would perpetuate a tax surcharge for educational use, won the tight Illinois governor's race, and a tax-rollback initiative, widely denounced as unrealistic, went down to defeat by a big margin in Massachusetts.

HEADLINE: The 1990 Elections: New York - Bond Act
New Math on Both Sides of the Hudson;
Defeat of the Environmental Bond Act May Mean Higher Taxes in New York

BYLINE: By ALLAN R. GOLD

 BODY:
The defeat of the $2 billion environmental bond act on Tuesday leaves communities throughout New York State with few ways to pay for urgent and costly landfill and recycling programs, many of them required by law.
As a result, residents already confronting a weakened economy may be faced with higher local property taxes, increased fees or service cuts in some towns to pay for measures mandated by state law, like the closing of leaking garbage landfills. New York City and Long Island may be particularly hard hit in a region that has all but run out of places to dump its waste. 
 Assessing the loss, politicians and environmentalists said yesterday that voters apparently acted on their concerns about the cost of the bond act at a time of widening budget gaps in Albany. Gov. Mario M. Cuomo attributed the loss in part to the inability of bond act proponents to explain why borrowing would not be a burden.
State officials estimated that the measure would have cost each resident $7 a year during the life of the bonds, over as much as 30 years, far less, they said, than the cost of increased property taxes or fees. Interest on the $1.975 billion bond would have doubled the overall cost of the issue. The bond act had designated $525 million for landfill closings and recycling. Communities that had hoped to borrow from the state for sewage-treatment plant improvements will now have to look elsewhere. Some of the $800 million in the act for land purchases was intended to protect drinking water sources, efforts that will now be delayed or done at the expense of other programs.
Threats of property tax increases could also put pressure on state legislators to place another environmental bond issue on the ballot in coming years, or find other ways to pay for problems like garbage disposal.
 
First Defeat of the Century
 The bond act's defeat was embarrassing to Mr. Cuomo, who had made the measure a leading campaign issue, and the state's environmental community, which underestimated the extent of opposition.
Voters turned back the 21st Century Environmental Quality Bond Act by a narrow margin, 51 percent to 49 percent, or less than 70,000 votes of 2.6 million cast. In addition to land acqusition and landfill or recycling programs, money from the bond would have been used to preserve historic buildings.
This is the first environmental bond act of the century to be defeated, after nine consecutive approvals.
Upstate voters trounced the environmental bond act. Many residents rejected it because they feared money from the act would be used to buy private land for conservation in areas like the Adirondacks, opponents said.
 
'Nervous About the Future'
 New York City and Westchester County voted overwhelmingly in favor of the bond. But in Nassau and Suffolk counties, where proponents thought they could count on strong support, residents were much less enthusiastic than they were in 1986, when a $1.45 billion bond act on closing hazardous waste sites passed by margins exceeding 2 to 1. In fact, Long Island's diminished support for the environmental act accounted for the difference between its winning and losing.
In Suffolk County, the 1990 act won by only about 8,000 votes, 75,000 fewer than in 1986. In Nassau County, residents approved the 1990 act by 50,000 votes, but 40,000 less than the winning margin in 1986. The 1990 act lost by less than 70,00 votes.
Patrick G. Halpin, Suffolk County Executive, attributed the vote to residents' concerns about the economy. "People are very nervous about the future," he said.
He said defeat of the bond act is particularly costly to Long Island.
"People really didn't understand the relationship of the funding of the bond act and their local property tax bill," said Tony Bullock, East Hampton town supervisor. "The impact to local property taxes will be enormous."
East Hampton, for example, faces as much as $22.5 million in costs for closing landfills in the next few years, as required by the state, Mr. Bullock said. The town had hoped that the bond act would cover as much as half those expenses, he said. East Hampton's 18,000 residents cannot afford the property tax increases, which could exceed $1,000 per taxpayer, if they are required to pick up the slack, he said.
Also, setting up a recycling and composting plant will cost $7.5 million, and the town was expecting the bond act to cover as much as half of that, he said.
Other communities are also affected.
 
There Goes the Beach
 The bond act's defeat reduces the prospects for Erie County to develop a bathing beach near downtown Buffalo on Lake Erie and to renovate a house designed by Frank Lloyd Wright for use as a state historic site, said Richard Tobe, the county's commissioner of environment and planning. The beach project is estimated to cost $12 million, and the Wright renovation, several million. Neither were required.
Mr. Tobe also said the county had hoped for some bond-act money for improvements in aging sewage-treatment plants in the next 5 to 10 years.
He said local taxes cannot support such expensive projects. He said new construction might be halted to keep sewaage-treatment plants operating within design limits.
Albert F. Appleton, the Environmental Protection Commissioner, said New York City lost a lot when the bond was defeated.
Over all, officials estimate the city lost from $500 million to $700 million. It lost $100 million for an esplanade on the Hudson River; $100 million for recycling and landfill projects, and $100 million to $200 million for park programs, like the Staten Island Green Belt, a chain of parkland running through that borough. Several million dollars was also lost for sewage-treatment plants and medical waste disposal.
In addition, the city lost $100 million for land in the Catskill watershed area, where the city gets 90 percent of it drinking water. The Department of Environmental Protection has begun a watershed protection program, one piece of which requires buying land surrounding city reservoirs.
"Watershed protection has got to be the top priority," Mr. Appleton said. He said the program will have to be financed either through higher water rates or at the expense of other city environmental programs, like water main replacement and sewers and sewage-treatment plant improvements.
The city's recycling program could also be hurt. The Sanitation Department expected nearly $100 million for recycling demonstration projects, processing centers and programs to develop markets for recycled material, said Steven M. Polan, the Sanitation Commissioner.
"Many of these programs are not going to go away because the bond act was voted down," Mr. Appleton said. "All this has done is shift the debate back to the State Legislature, at the worst possible time."

HEADLINE: The 1990 Elections: New Jersey - A Governor's Response
New Math on Both Sides of the Hudson;
Hearing Tax Outcry in New Jersey Vote, Florio Says He'll Consider New Course

BYLINE: By PETER KERR

 BODY:
Seemingly chastened, Gov. Jim Florio of New Jersey said yesterday that the near defeat of Senator Bill Bradley on Tuesday had sent a "humbling message" aimed at himself and his aggressive tax and social policies, and that he was opening his entire legislative program to revision.
That would include New Jersey's new school-financing law, which is shifting large amounts of state aid from rich school districts to poorer ones. 
 "I got the message; the results were really directed at me and the policies of my administration," Mr. Florio said. He said there was "great skepticism" among voters about whether his policies would meet their goals.
 
Bradley Feels the Anger
 In fact, political experts were saying that "skepticism" was an understatement of the wrath that had nearly ruined Mr. Bradley, who had long been New Jersey's most popular Democrat and who had been mentioned before Tuesday as a potential Democratic presidential contender.
"There is no support for the belief in redistribution of income if it means higher taxes," said Steven Salmore, a Republican political consultant and professor at Rutgers University. "I can see no other message than that."
At his campaign headquarters, Senator Bradley said that a little more than a week ago he sensed the anger of voters over taxes that led to his narrow margin of victory -- 55,180 votes out of 1.9 million cast -- over his Republican opponent, Christine Todd Whitman. [Page B16.]
Governor Florio's statement yesterday came months after his administration put through a host of liberal social programs, including the school-refinancing law. To pay for them and to balance the budget he pushed through $2.8 billion in tax increases.
In his own campaign last year, however, Mr. Florio had said repeatedly that he saw no need to raise taxes. When he did so after taking office, many New Jerseyans saw his approach as arrogant and willful. Even as his program was watched as a test of whether the public would support a liberal Democrat's plan to tax the rich to aid the poor, a broad tax revolt erupted at home.
Among New Jerseyans leaving voting places on Tuesday, four out of five disapproved of Governor Florio's fiscal policies, a poll by Voter Research and Surveys showed.
In a statehouse news conference yesterday, Mr. Florio said: "Last night's races brought home to me, somewhat dramatically, that I could have done a lot better in bringing people into the Democratic process. There is a need to look at everything we've done to make sure it achieves the goals and delivers on the promise."
Mr. Florio said the school-financing formula, which shifts hundreds of millions of dollars from New Jersey's wealthiest suburban school districts to less affluent cities and towns, was an "easily identifiable" issue in which the admininistration will work "to bring more people into the process."
 
Avoiding Specifics
 The Governor said he remained committed to his goals, but he added that none of his policies could survive unless people believed they would bring positive results.
At the same time, he and his aides avoided discussing what concessions they might make to their critics and, in particular, how they might agree on revising a host of tax increases, from a one percent rise in the sales tax to income tax increases for the wealthy.
Earlier this week, officials said, Mr. Florio instructed aides to begin reviewing the education and tax legislation for possible revisions. But the administration is also limited by an unexpected fall in tax revenues brought on by an economic slowdown, and by a state Supreme Court decision requiring increased aid to the state's poorest districts.
In addition to the near miss of Mr. Bradley's campaign, Mr. Florio saw a heavily financed Democrat lose a special State Senate election on the New Jersey shore, and he suffered the defeat of a $135 million bond issue that he had proposed to provide affordable housing.
Both the State Senate candidate, Edward H. Salmon, and the housing bond had been opposed by Hands Across New Jersey, a citizens action group formed in response to the Florio tax plan.
In the First Congressional District, in the Camden area -- which Mr. Florio had represented for 15 years and where Democrats outnumber Republicans two to one -- the Democratic candidate, Robert Andrews, won a race that politicians in his own party called disappointingly close.
 
'He Is Well Advised to Listen'
 Some Democratic officials who are looking ominously at legislative elections next year responded positively to the Governor's message.
" I think it is the wisest thing to do; when the public speaks, he is well advised to listen and listen well," said Robert C. Janiszewski, the Democratic Executive of Hudson County. "I think people in the party will welcome an opportunity to open up the dialogue. This election will prompt us all to re-examine where we are. That involves everything from soup to nuts."
Several Republican legislators and at least one founding member of Hands Across New Jersey reacted cautiously. They said they were encouraged by the Governor's words but would wait for him to take action, like moving to repeal his tax increases.
"If you are ready to fish, fish," said Garabed Haytaian, the Republican Minority leader of the State Assembly. "If you are ready to cut bait, cut bait."
 
2 Sides to Florio
 In recent weeks, as polls showed Mr. Florio's support among voters dropping, the administration has become sharply divided between two factions of advisers and, officials say, between two sides of Mr. Florio's personality.
On one side, Mr. Florio's Treasurer, Douglas C. Berman, and his Director of Communications, Jon Shure, have urged the Governor to continue speaking out on behalf of the tax program. Their advice resonates with a side of the Governor's personality, they said, that sees political issues as battles between right and wrong. At times Mr. Florio vowed to continue speaking out for policies on moral grounds even if the public rejected them.
Other advisers, including Mr. Florio's Chief of Staff, Joseph C. Salema, have urged Mr. Florio to stop trying to save the world and begin trying to save himself.

U.N. Aide Fears Iraqis Can Militarize Medicine

BYLINE: By PAUL LEWIS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Nov. 7

 BODY:
A senior official in charge of enforcing economic sanctions against Iraq expressed concern today that Baghdad may be importing pharmaceuticals and other medical supplies that could be used in the manufacture of chemical or biological weapons.
The official, Marjatta Rasi of Finland, who heads the United Nations Security Council committee monitoring compliance with the trade embargo, said at a news conference that Iraq is bringing in "tons and tons of medicines it does not need." 
 She expressed concern that these medicines could include "dual purpose" pharmaceuticals that might be used to help Iraq's known program for manufacturing chemical and biological weapons in breach of the Security Council's total arms embargo.
Miss Rasi said her suspicions had been aroused because in some cases Iraq has imported sufficent quantities of drugs to last it for up to 10 years.
 
Experts Discount Threat
 But medical experts contacted by Reuters said such a threat is unlikely.
"Our people say the idea of using medications for making chemical weapons is not too plausible," said William Grigg of the American Food and Drug Administration. "It would be more probable if they were importing agricultural chemicals -- pesticides and the like."
Thomas Lemke, a chemist at the University of Houston, told Reuters that most medicines were too weak to be used to poison a water supply and too complicated to be broken down into their constituent parts.
As to building a biological arsenal from imported vaccines, "the answer is no," said Alan Goldhammer of the Industrial Biotechnology Association, a trade group. "The only thing it could conceivably be receiving would be vaccines, and they are either disabled or inactivated."
 
Treaty Being Prepared
 Miss Rasi said that negotiators preparing a treaty in Geneva to ban the manufacture or possession of all chemical weapons have also expressed concern to her about Iraq's continued large pharmaceutical imports.
But she said she had no clear evidence of sanctions violations and no firm numbers on the amount of medicine Iraq is receiving.
This is because the Security Council resolutions imposing trade sanctions on Iraq for its annexation of Kuwait specifically exclude medicines from the embargo as does the resolution extending this embargo to all air traffic.
Some countries have told the Security Council's sanctions committee they were sending in medicines when they asked its permission to fly planes to Baghdad to evacuate their nationals but usually without specifying exactly what these medicines were. So far the Council has authorized about 20 such flights.
 
Inspections Not Required
 But in addition, Miss Rasi said some nations, which she did not identify, appeared to be flying in supplies of medicine directly, merely telling the countries their planes fly over that they are carrying pharmaceuticals. As a result, the planes are not required to land for inspection to insure they are not breaking the trade ban.
Miss Rasi said she favored some tightening of the trade sanctions to make sure that only genuine medicines were sent into Iraq as well as steps insuring their use only for humanitarian purposes. The sanctions committee is expected to discuss the issue at a meeting here on Thursday.
Miss Rasi said that in other respects the trade embargo appeared to be working well and that the committee had still received no reports of any violations.
While a good harvest and the looting of supplies held in Kuwait has enabled Iraq to survive without great hardship so far, she predicted "a major grain shortage" by next spring as well as a general deterioration of the country's economy through lack of raw materials and spare parts.

HEADLINE: U.S. VIEW PREVAILS AT CLIMATE PARLEY

BYLINE: By MARLISE SIMONS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: GENEVA, Nov. 7

 BODY:
United States negotiators today turned aside an effort to set specific targets for wealthy countries to reduce emissions of carbon dioxide, which is widely expected to cause a dangerous heating of the global atmosphere.
Instead, the 135 nations represented at the World Climate Conference ending here today adopted a declaration that urges countries to set targets, national programs or strategies to limit so-called greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide, but avoided further details. 
 Such gases are known to trap heat in the atmosphere, and their concentrations are growing. Many scientists expect that this will cause the global climate to warm substantially, but they disagree whether this has yet been demonstrated.
Despite pleas from scientists and politicians at the conference, two of the world's largest producers of the gas, the United States and the Soviet Union, refused to commit themselves now to cutting their output of carbon dioxide.
But the 10-day conference had other, immediate effects: it galvanized rich nations besides the United States into pledging cutbacks in their own carbon dioxide production, thereby putting new pressure on Washington.
The pledges will mean higher costs in the near future for cars, heat and electricity, and a rush to produce more efficient machines and appliances. Japan, Canada, Australia and New Zealand and 18 European nations have announced such plans to cut back carbon dioxide.
 
New Environmental Market
 The gathering also served to confirm that industries in the world's two strongest economies have been reading the trends correctly: companies in Japan and Germany are already racing to produce technology to match environmental concerns. Politicians and industry representatives from both nations said environmental policies are creating enormous new economic opportunities.
The Geneva meeting, held under the auspices of the World Meteorological Organization and the United Nations Environment Program, is a stage in the work toward a global convention on addressing climate change.
Although formal negotiations for the treaty do not begin in Washington until Febrruary, some industrial nations pushed here for strong language with specific targets applying to rich countries, who jointly account for 75 percent of the world's carbon dioxide, most of them by burning fossil fuels.
The United States succeeded in watering down key portions of the 30-point document adopted by consensus today. United States negotiators led an effort to include wording that emphasized the scientific uncertainties surrounding global warming and that evaded a commitment to channel new technology to protect the environment at almost no cost to poor nations.
The United States supporters most in evidence were oil exporters like Saudi Arabia, Venezuela and the Soviet Union, who like Washington argued that not enough was known to act now on climate change. Western negotiators had expected no pledges from the Soviet Union, the largest producer of carbon dioxide after the United States; its inefficient industries and economy would be unable to afford the investment in cutting back pollution.
 
China Opposes Cutbacks
 China, another large polluter, said it could make no cutbacks because that would mean it could not industrialize. "We need not cut back because our per capita emissions are very low," said a delegate. "An American uses 18 times more energy than a Chinese."
John Knauss, director of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, who led the United States delegation, said Washington had refused to set targets because "it does not believe in them," adding: "It's as simple as that. We are not prepared to guarantee our projections."
European governments agree that by raising taxes and using energy more efficiently they can cut back or reverse close to 20 percent of their carbon dioxide emissions over the next 10 years without impairing economic growth. Japan and other nations concur. But they concede that cuts beyond this target will become more difficult.
American officials here, however, questioned the European targets, which they characterized as political goals not easy to put into effect. European officials at the conference argued that the European Community's common strategy to cut pollution was prepared not just by environmental ministers, but also with energy ministers.
In Italy, Germany, the Netherlands and Great Britain, parliaments have already approved the program to cut carbon emissions. The agreement reached by European Community countries last week is binding, and all members are expected to submit their by the end of this year.
The intense haggling over the conference declaration, which lasted more than five days, has given a glimpse of how difficult it will be to reach an international accord on global warming. Many developing nations here fought against language that committed them to curbing population growth. Nations with tropical forests insisted on complete sovereignty.
As experts here last week debated scenarios of a world 50 years from now, delegates from African and Asian countries said they were frustrated because, they said, more study should be focused on dealing with extreme climate variations causing floods and droughts today.

HEADLINE: Advanced Chip Offered By Texas Instruments

BYLINE: By THOMAS C. HAYES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DALLAS, Nov. 7

 BODY:
Restoring a touch of pride for American makers of computer chips, Texas Instruments Inc. said today that it was delivering limited supplies of its model of the world's most advanced memory chip to some of its largest customers.
Samsung of South Korea and Hitachi and Toshiba of Japan have made similar announcements within the last two months, and NEC of Japan said it would begin small shipments of its dynamic random access memory chip that stores 16 million bits or two million characters before the end of the year. 
 Texas Instruments, one of the few American chip makers that did not quit making memory chips in the early 1980's, accounts for a big share of the nation's memory chip output. Japanese companies held 69 percent of worldwide memory chip sales in 1989, and American producers had 16 percent, according to Dataquest Inc., a research firm in San Jose, Calif.
 
 'Perseverance Has Paid Off'
 "It's nice to know that Texas Instruments' perseverance has paid off in being able to compete," said Ione Ishii, a Dataquest analyst who follows the industry. She said worldwide sales of 16-megabit memory chips would exceed $5 billion in 1994.
The executive directing Texas Instruments' production of the advanced memory chips, Lionel White, said in a statement that design engineers and computer industry managers say Texas Instruments has a slight lead over its foreign competitors in the race for high-volume production.
"According to our customers, these 16-megabit samples are the first they've seen that are based on a design developed for high-volume production," he said. Initial output of the chips will be from the company's newest semiconductor plant, in Avezzano, Italy. Other Texas Instruments plants in Dallas; Miho, Japan, and Taiwan will be equipped later to make the chip.
The International Business Machines Corporation and American Telephone and Telegraph Company have also spent heavily to develop and produce the 16-megabit chip, but virtually all of their output would be for their own products.
The 16-megabit memory chip is certain to lead to smaller and more powerful products in the computer and telecommunications industries, as well as find broader uses in aircraft, automobiles and other products. It is also a crucial technology being developed for high-definition television.
A single 16-megabit D-RAM chip the size of a fingernail can provide two million characters of storage in computers. That is about four times the total capacity of the I.B.M. and similar personal computers in the mid-1980's using as many as 20 chips.
 
 Agreement With Hitachi
 Texas Instruments has shared research in developing the 16-megabit chip with Hitachi through an agreement the companies signed in 1988. Stan Victor, a spokesman, said the Texas Instruments' chip was based on the company's own designs and manufacturing process.
In mastering the high-volume production process, Texas Instruments reduced the width of electronic circuits in the new chip to less than a one-hundredth of the width of a human hair, or nearly six-tenths of a micron.
Texas Instruments' shares gained 12.5 cents, to $25.75, in trading on the New York Stock Exchange today. The shares traded as high as $27.375 during the session but retreated during the market's broad selloff later in the day.

Satellite TV's Appeal to Comsat

BYLINE: By Edmund L. Andrews

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
WHEN the Communications Satellite Corporation bought a majority stake in the Denver Nuggets basketball team, a lot of people wondered why. Now, as the company contemplates investing $100 million in a new satellite television venture, the answer seems clear.
Robert J. Wussler, president of Comsat Video Enterprises and formerly the second-in-command at Turner Broadcasting System Inc., wants do with satellites what his former boss, Ted Turner, did with cable television. Mr. Turner, who owns the Atlanta Braves baseball team and Atlanta Hawks basketball team, has used his franchises as a cornerstone for sports programming over the TBS and Turner Network Television cable channels. 
 "Just as VCR and cable television were methods of distribution for the 1980's, we think direct-broadcast satellite is the technology of the 1990's," Mr. Wussler said in an interview.
But even the most charitable securities analysts are reserving judgment. Comsat's record is littered with earlier, botched attempts to enter new businesses, from satellite antennas to telephone equipment, that have cost the company hundreds of millions of dollars since 1980.
 Based in Washington, Comsat serves as the Federal Government's representative to Intelsat, the international satellite consortium owned by 119 governments, and its core business has been providing international communications through Intelsat. It is a strong business that earned $105 million on revenues of $280 million last year.
But with both its rates and profits are determined by the Federal Communications Commission, Comsat has repeatedly tried to move into less regulated areas.
A year ago, the company paid $18 million for a 62.5 percent stake of the Denver Nuggets. Company officials say the move was primarily intended to give them an entree in negotiating broadcast rights with other teams and leagues.
Comsat is now weighing an investment of $100 million to $125 million in a new direct-broadcast satellite company, the Skypix Corporation, of Seattle, its officials confirm. It wants to broadcast about 80 channels of programming, including 40 to 50 movies and a rich array of sports events, directly to households around the nation using antennas less than 2 feet in diameter. Viewers would be charged for each program they watch.
Skypix has spent $20 million developing its technology and estimates that it needs $200 million to $300 million more to bring the system to market. Comsat is reported to have signed a memorandum of understanding to invest a big chunk of the capital, provided Skypix can line up other investors and get the F.C.C. to approve its transmission technology. "We have made no firm commitments yet," a Comsat spokesman, Richard McGraw, said.
Mr. Wussler thinks satellite broadcasting has considerable appeal. He likes that direct-broadcast satellites can reach rural viewers who cannot be connected to cable television. Also, by using new transmission technologies, Skypix and other companies hope to send multiple channels of programming over a single satellite transponder, offering the promise of lower costs and greater variety in programming.
Two large rivals are developing their own satellite systems: Sky Cable, a joint venture backed by NBC, Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation, Hughes Communications Inc. and the Cablevision Systems Corporation, and K-Prime Partners, a venture backed by several large cable television companies.
But analysts are dubious about Comsat's plans, given its record. At Comsat Video Entertainment, losses on a "pay per view" movie service for hotel rooms that began several years ago climbed to $18 million in 1989 from $5 million in 1987 and are expected to reach at least $25 million this year. Part of the trouble is that a software glitch allowed some customers to watch movies without being billed. But the more enduring problem is that Comsat Video lags the industry leader, Spectradyne Inc., in signing up hotel chains that cater to business travelers.
Also, in the early 1980's, Comsat sank $193 million into building two direct-broadcast satellites, only to stop the project amid poor market prospects. There have been other dead ends in manufacturing: Since 1987, the company has sold off or abandoned operations that made satellite dishes, earth stations, microwave amplifiers and a host of other equipment.
 After all this, some analysts contend that Mr. Wussler should stay closer to Comsat's core business, where demand is growing. "We urge our clients to sell their shares now, before Comsat management buries them even more with their next fiasco," wrote James M. McCabe, an analyst at Normura Securities, in a recent report.
Mr. McGraw of Comsat responded that his company would not make a rash move. "This is not a fly-by-night decision that Comsat is trying to make," he said, noting that it has been looking at direct-broadcast satellite for more than a year. "When we do make a decison, it will be one based on good market research and a good business plan that provides a good return for our shareholders."

HEADLINE: THE 1990 ELECTIONS: Governor's Race;
Cuomo, Omnipotence Blunted, Gets Back to Budget

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH KOLBERT

 BODY:
On the heels of a successful, but still disappointing, re-election bid, Gov. Mario M. Cuomo returned to Albany yesterday to confront one of the most severe challenges of his tenure: how to balance the state budget when the nation is slipping into a recession, New York City is edging toward a fiscal crisis and voters in New York State appear to be fed up with tax increases.
Compared with other governors facing angry electorates, Mr. Cuomo emerged from Tuesday's vote relatively unscathed. In Rhode Island and Florida, for example, the incumbent governors were defeated. In Massachusetts and Connecticut, the incumbents did not even bother to run. 
 But for most of his eight years in office, Mr. Cuomo has enjoyed an image of near omnipotence that was sorely challenged by the election results. And both fiscally and politically, he is now heading into his third term in what is probably the weakest position he has been in as Governor.
 
'The Toughest Time'
 "I think this is the toughest time he's had to face," said the Assembly Speaker, Mel Miller, a Brooklyn Democrat.
The Governor, Mr. Miller said, "did not do so well" in the election. On top of that, he said, "I don't think the problems have ever been worse."
Mr. Cuomo, who under better circumstances rarely misses an opportunity to meet the press, was uncharacteristically silent yesterday on the subject of the election.
Through his press office, he issued a statement expressing gratitude toward his supporters, but acknowledging disappointment.
"Given the difficult challenges confronting local governments across the nation, and the anti-incumbent sentiment born of those hard times, the continued strong support of the voters was particularly generous," he said.
 
Many Reasons for Concern
 For Mr. Cuomo, the results of virtually every major contest in the state gave reason for concern.
In his own race, Mr. Cuomo showed unexpected weakness, receiving 53 percent of the vote against opponents who early on in the race had been dismissed as sure losers. Four years ago the Governor's total was 10 points higher.
"Clearly the Governor is still popular, but not anywhere near the numbers he had four years ago," said Lee Miringoff, director of the Marist Institute for Public Opinion in Poughkeepsie, which does frequent polling on state politics. "I think he was caught up in some of the same anti-incumbent buzz that affected other governors."
The Republican challenger, Pierre A. Rinfret, received 22 percent of the vote; the Conservative candidate, Herbert I. London, polled 21 percent.
The defeat of the proposed $2 billion environmental bond issue, which Mr. Cuomo had vigorously campaigned for and had become closely identified with, was not only a political setback for the Governor, but was also a significant fiscal blow. More than $60 million from the now nonexistent bond act money has already been committed, leaving the state further in the hole at a time it can ill afford more debt.
The failure of the Democratic Party to gain control of the State Senate represented another rebuke to the Governor. Mr. Cuomo had campaigned energetically for several Democratic candidates, only to have the Republicans pick up a Senate seat. They now control the Senate 35 to 26.
 
Tougher Budget Balancing
 Mr. Cuomo and the Senate Republicans have often been at odds over fiscal issues, and the Republicans' strong showing is likely to make the Governor's task of balancing the state budget, which at last count was $824 million in the red, that much tougher.
"The Senate can now make the argument: 'We're mainstream,' " said Mr. Miller.
Aides to Mr. Cuomo attributed much of Tuesday's results to low voter turnout in areas, particularly New York City, that have historically been the Governor's greatest sources of support. The environmental bond act, for example, received overwhelming support in New York City, but a disproportionately low turnout there gave a strong "no" vote upstate more significance.
Paradoxically, it was the weakness of the Governor's opponent that explains, at least in part, that shift in turnout.
Republican State Senate candidates, eager to avoid falling victim to Mr. Rinfret's erratic campaign, mounted vigorous "get-out-the-vote" efforts, while many city voters stayed home.
"The Governor was a victim of a weak opponent," an adviser to Mr. Cuomo said. "People didn't vote in the city because they thought the election was a done deal."
 
'A Very Clear Message'
 Unofficial results from the New York State Board of Elections, show that almost 55 percent of the eligible voters upstate went to the polls, compared with 35 percent in the city.
Republicans, however, dismissed the Cuomo administration's characterization of the results, interpreting the returns as a proof that voters were fed up with Mr. Cuomo's policies.
"People aren't happy with taxes; they aren't happy with crime," said the State Senate's majority leader, Ralph J. Marino, a Nassau County Republican. "I think it's a very clear message."
Republicans in Washington joined with Republicans in New York to pronounce Tuesday's results a sign of weakness that would dog Governor Cuomo in any Presidential bid.
"I think some of the luster is taken out of Cuomo's Presidential candidacy," said Roger Stone, a Republican political consultant. "It was a sort of hollow victory for him."
Democrats, however, said that whatever setbacks the Governor suffered were minor compared with those suffered by many other incumbents and would soon be forgotten, leaving Mr. Cuomo's national ambitions -- if he has them -- unaffected.
"I don't think anyone will remember this in two weeks," said Carter Eskew, a Washington-based Democratic consultant. He noted that whatever damage Mr. Cuomo had suffered as a possible Presidential candidate, President Bush, who campaigned hard for several losing gubernatorial candidates, had probably suffered more.
"You have to remember," he said, "while it may have been a mixed bag for Mario Cuomo, it also was a bad day for George Bush."

HEADLINE: Mayor to Seek Cuts to Close Budget Gap

BYLINE: By TODD S. PURDUM

 BODY:
In an important test of his credibility in the financial world, Mayor David N. Dinkins is to present today his plan for service reductions and other cuts that could mean several hundred layoffs to help close a gap of about $400 million in New York City's budget.
The plans call for closing two fire companies, cutting hundreds of school workers, including teachers, delaying recycling programs and eliminating 150 administrative jobs in the city hospitals, most of them through layoffs. They will also mean dirtier streets and parks, reduced library services and cuts in perquisites and aides for police and fire officials. 
 Up to the last minute, there was sharp disagreement on the impact of the cutbacks, with school officials contending that the $90 million in savings they were being asked to find would force the average school to lay off five to seven teachers in midyear, or the equivalent dollar value in other employees. The total for the city would be roughly 6,200 teachers, or the equivalent in less costly employees, said the deputy schools chancellor for operations, Stanley S. Litow.
 
'A Tragedy for Our Schools'
 Schools Chancellor Joseph A. Fernandez issued a statement yesterday saying that the Mayor's plan was "riddled with inaccuracies and terribly misleading to the public" and that the cuts were "a tragedy for our schools." He said that asking schools to make such reductions "is very unfair and a cruel message to our city's children."
But senior administration officials, while acknowledging some school layoffs could be needed, said they hoped most cuts could be made through attrition by not replacing workers, and by cutting more than the 200 workers in central headquarters jobs that schools officials have agreed to.
The Mayor issued a statement last night saying he regretted Mr. Fernandez's "intemperate comments" and urging him to use his "proven management and leadership skills" and "moral suasion" to make reductions that would keep layoffs to a minimum.
Final details were still being hammered out last night, even as Mr. Dinkins and his aides ended an unusual whirlwind round of advance briefings and meetings with business leaders, fiscal monitors and elected officials in an effort to assure support for their proposals for keeping the budget in balance for the fiscal year that ends June 30.
That support is needed because the city is to issue more than $2 billion in notes and bonds in the coming weeks. Last month, Wall Street rating agencies warned that the city's credit rating on its bonds might fall, forcing it to pay higher interest rates, if it did not act aggressively to cut costs.
But one key official, Peter F. Vallone, Speaker of the City Council, whose approval is needed to enact the budget modifications, was angered that the Mayor intended to brief him at 8 last night -- well after some private citizens had been briefed -- and he said he would skip the briefing and give the plan "deep analysis" today.
Mayoral aides allowed that cutting teachers, even through attrition, would be hard but neccesary, since the school system takes up one-quarter of the city's budget and has largely been spared the trims other agencies have been required to make in recent years.
 
Support at Stake
 The battle over the schools budget is a delicate political dance for Mr. Dinkins, who has dedicated his administration to children, and for Mr. Fernandez, who took office at the same time Mr. Dinkins did with a mandate to reshape the system. Neither can easily afford to lose the other's support, or the support of the Board of Education, whose president Mr. Dinkins appointed.
But Mr. Fernandez has told associates that City Hall is creating a job crisis in the schools to pressure the teachers' union into abrogating the recent 5.5 percent wage increase it won.
Mr. Dinkins's aides deny that, though he has been under pressure from fiscal monitors, since he agreed to the raise, and even yesterday his labor negotiators were struggling to reach settlements with other workers.
Mr. Litow said City Hall's proposed budget cut would mean that the city's 634 elementary schools and 178 middle schools would be forced to cut as many as five to seven teachers each and the city's 120 high schools as many as 20 teachers apiece.
District superintendents and high school principals could choose to make the cuts among other personnel -- administrators, school aides, guidance counselors, security guards, lunchroom workers and administrators -- instead of teachers. The ability to cut the teaching staff is limited by contractual ceilings placed on class size.
The plan to be outlined today is far from the last of the bad news likely to come from City Hall in the next several weeks. Mr. Dinkins must still grapple with the mix of greater cuts or new taxes that will be needed to close a gap of perhaps $2 billion for the fiscal year that starts next July 1. The administration said as many as 35,000 layoffs might be needed.
For now, several agencies were able to stave off deeper cuts. Mr. Dinkins allowed the Fire Department to trim 1 percent of its budget, or slightly more than $6 million, instead of the 2 percent, or $13 million target originally proposed, fire officials said.
The department will eliminate 55 chief's aides, who serve as drivers and on-scene coordinators at fires, freeing those firefighters for regular duty. It will also close two fire companies, though no firehouses, in undetermined neighborhoods, not the 18 companies that Fire Commissioner Carlos A. Rivera had warned might be closed.

HEADLINE: The 1990 Elections: Signals - The Outcome;
VOTERS OUST GOVERNING PARTY IN 14 STATES; CONGRESS IS SHAKEN BUT FEW ARE UNSEATED

BYLINE: By ROBIN TONER

 BODY:
A divisive, tumultuous midterm election has ended with a striking new class of governors, a strengthened Democratic majority in Congress and some ominous signals for President Bush and other potential candidates in 1992.
After days of strenuous campaigning in Sun Belt states where Republicans hoped to build on the Reagan legacy, Mr. Bush saw both his party's candidates and his prestige suffer in Tuesday's voting. 
 Democrats, picking up one Senate seat and eight in the House of Representatives, remained dug in on Capitol Hill, ready for two more years of assertiveness toward Mr. Bush. But they saw less than overpowering performances from two of the party's brightest Presidential hopes, Gov. Mario M. Cuomo of New York and Senator Bill Bradley of New Jersey.
 
Shifts in 14 Races
 In the biggest change on Tuesday, 14 of the governorships shifted from one party to another. Two of them went to candidates who ran as independents: Lowell P. Weicker Jr. of Connecticut and, in Alaska, Walter J. Hickel, a former Interior Secretary.
Political strategists concluded that 1990 would go into the books as a difficult, unpredictable year in which voters decided to throw out some incumbents, shake up some others and might have done more if they had been offered a choice of stronger challengers.
"If Congressional incumbents read their re-elections as a vote for the status quo, they'll be sadly mistaken," said Geoffrey Garin, a Democratic poll taker. "This was a year when it wouldn't have taken much to tip the scales."
 
Big Prize for G.O.P.
 Democrats made serious inroads into the Sun Belt, picking up the governorships of Florida and Texas. But Republicans managed to hold on to the biggest single prize, California, and also wrested two big Middle Western states from the Democrats -- Ohio and Michigan -- as well as the Democratic stronghold of Massachusetts.
The 36 governors' races provided the clearest reflection of this year's volatile electorate, which was buffeted by the threat of war in the Middle East and recession at home, angry at politics and politicians, worried about a range of local issues and grumpy over the President's backpedaling on his 1988 no-new-taxes pledge.
This restiveness left its mark on two potential Presidential candidates: Mr. Cuomo won re-election with just 53 percent of the vote against weak opposition, and Mr. Bradley barely survived a challenge from a little-known Republican, Christine Todd Whitman.
It was also reflected in the close calls many incumbents had on Election Day, including Representative Newt Gingrich, the second-ranking Republican in the House, who barely survived a challenge in his suburban Atlanta district.
Howard Schloss, a spokesman for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, said the re-election margins for incumbents were lower than usual "pretty much across the board."
According to Common Cause, a Congressional watchdog group, the number of House incumbents re-elected with 60 percent of the vote or less was twice as high as the number in 1988.
 
96 Percent of House Members
 For all of that, 96 percent of the House members seeking re-election prevailed, down just slightly from the 98 percent rate of the past two election years. Still, some analysts said the voters' discontent boded ill for elected officials in 1992, when the redrawing of Congressional district lines and retirements will create the potential for sweeping change in the House.
Fred Wertheimer, head of Common Cause, said the 1990 election demonstrated how the advantages of incumbency, particularly the campaign financing system, can thwart an angry electorate bent on change. "The system blocked people from really beating incumbents," Mr. Wertheimer said. "Where the anger really played out was at the margins."
Democrats were eager to present the election results as a rebuff to President Bush. Ronald H. Brown, chairman of the Democratic National Committee, asserted, "More than anything else, this election has been a vote of 'no confidence' in George Bush."
But more damaging to Mr. Bush was the pervasive sense in his own party that the White House had jeopardized its candidates by mishandling the budget negotiations. Democrats used the budget talks to hammer the Republicans as the guardians of the rich.
 
'You Win Some'
 Mr. Bush spent a quiet day in the White House, while Marlin Fitzwater, the White House spokesman, tried to play down Mr. Bush's influence on the elections. "You win some and you lose some," Mr. Fitzwater said. "We campaigned hard in Texas and lost, campaigned hard in California and won."
Privately, some Republicans said they were relieved that the party came out as well as it did. "We've been through so much in the last couple of months, there was a palpable sense of relief that it wasn't worse," one Republican strategist said.
In briefings yesterday, Republican officials tried to put the best face on the midterm results. Representative Guy Vander Jagt, chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee, said that Republicans had done well considering the losses often suffered by a President's party in midterm elections. "And we had U.S. troops in the desert and an economy on the brink of recession," Mr. Vander Jagt said.
Edward J. Rollins Jr., the Republican Congressional committee official who has clashed openly with the White House over the budget talks and their impact on Republican candidates, said, "I think it's important for the President to sit down with House Republicans and make peace."
Mr. Rollins said he believed that Mr. Bush was "extremely well-prepared to run for re-election in 1992," but also gave voice to the concern widespread among Republican strategists. Republicans, he said, need to pay attention to the voters, attracted in President Ronald Reagan's heyday, who have given them the margin of victory in many crucial elections, like blue-collar Democrats.
"Ten to 12 years of successes can leave you fat, dumb and happy," Mr. Rollins said. "We may have taken some voter groups for granted."
In the short term, Mr. Bush faces a Democratic Party emboldened by its victories on Capitol Hill and, even more importantly, by the whiff of Mr. Bush's vulnerability. "From Labor Day on, the noise you hear is the hissing of air coming out of his balloon," said Harrison Hickman, a Democratic poll taker. "This punctured the balloon of his invincibility."
 
Contrasts in Treatment
 There were many currents and crosscurrents in this election. The clearest contrast was between the beating that voters accorded their governors and the comparatively gentle treatment they gave members of the House and Senate.
"It's partly a story about the difference between executives and legislators," said Thomas E. Mann, director of governmental studies at the Brookings Institution, a Washington research group. "Executives are forced to make decisions and be held accountable for them, while legislators, particularly in a time of divided government, are often able to blur lines of responsibility and accountability."
It also reflects the two parties' long-range strategy: Neither anticipated the voters' angry mood this year and did the kind of aggressive recruiting of candidates that would have enabled them to take advantage of it.
Voter turnout in Tuesday's elections appeared to be the same as it was in 1986, when the level was the lowest in nearly half a century, said Curtis Gans, a voting analyst who is director of the Committee for the Study of the American Electorate. In 1986, 36.4 percent of the eligible voters went to the polls.
The Democrats pushed their majority in the Senate to 56 to 44, a change of just one seat from their previous 55-to-45 margin, with the upset of Senator Rudy Boschwitz, Republican of Minnesota. The Democrats also added eight seats to their already lopsided 259-to-176 majority in the House at the beginning of the term. Two of the House seats were vacated during the term, one by a Democrat and the other by a Republican.
Mr. Boschwitz lost at the hands of Paul Wellstone, an underfinanced political science professor whose campaign was emblematic of the outsider, insurgent appeals that popped up in the autumn of 1990. But most Senate incumbents beat back their challengers by sizable margins, including three Republican Senators, Jesse Helms of North Carolina, Mark O. Hatfield of Oregon and Mitch McConnell of Kentucky.
Democratic incumbents in contested races who also prevailed included Senators Daniel K. Akaka of Hawaii, Paul Simon of Illinois, Claiborne Pell of Rhode Island, John Kerry of Massachusetts, Jim Exon of Nebraska and Carl Levin of Michigan.
 
Impact on 1992 Races
 The Democrats' success on Tuesday means that Republicans will have a far more difficult time in regaining control of the Senate in 1992. The Republicans had hoped to pick away at the Democratic margin this year in advance of an all-out assault in 1992. Democrats have 20 members up for re-election in that Presidential election year, while the Republicans have only 14.
The races for governor were far more competitive. One of the most dramatic contests was in Texas, where Ann Richards, a Democrat, won a come-from-behind victory over Clayton Williams, the millionaire oilman whose rough-hewn style became more controversial than charming as the election went on. The election also saw a different kind of comeback story with Lawton Chiles, a Democrat who retired from the Senate two years ago, saying he was burned out, but returned to claim the governorship of Florida from the Republican incumbent, Bob Martinez.
Republicans captured the big prize of the night by winning California, where Senator Pete Wilson prevailed in a bruising battle against Dianne Feinstein, the former mayor of San Francisco. They also won an upset victory in Michigan, where John Engler ousted the Democratic incumbent, James Blanchard, and captured the governorship in Ohio, where George Voinovich defeated Anthony J. Celebrezze Jr.
This created an unlikely portrait of gains by Democrats in the Sun Belt and by Republicans in Democratic strongholds of the Middle West. But analysts cautioned that the governors' races were usually intensely idiosyncratic, a reflection of local issues and concerns rather than national trends.
This election year was widely expected to be dominated by the abortion issue, but it played out in far more complicated ways than it did in 1989. Both sides had victories to cite this week. Abortion rights supporters noted that the governorships in Florida, California and Texas were all won by candidates who support legalized abortion. The anti-abortion groups noted that candidates embracing their cause prevailed in the Kansas and Ohio governors' races, as well as in North Carolina's Senate race.

EGYPT'S PRESIDENT CALLS FOR A DELAY IN ATTACKING IRAQ

BYLINE: By JUDITH MILLER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CAIRO, Nov. 7

 BODY:
President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt said today that the coalition allied against Iraq should wait "at least two to three more months" to determine whether the economic sanctions were able to force President Saddam Hussein to withdraw from Kuwait. But he warned President Hussein that if he did not pull his troops out, war was inevitable with "the greatest concentration of military force I have ever seen in this area."
"There will be no other way way out," Mr. Mubarak declared. "I am not bluffing. I don't think the United States is bluffing. How can Saddam Hussein make such a miscalculation of his situation? It is very dangerous for him, very dangerous. I wonder how he cannot realize that." 
 In an interview the day after he conferred alone with Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d about the course of action to take against Iraq, the Egyptian leader said the time had come for the United Nations Security Council to approve a resolution authorizing the use of the military force to end Iraq's occupation of Kuwait if diplomacy failed.
 
Outlines of a Consensus
 His remarks were consistent with those of aides to Mr. Baker and of Saudi officials in Riyadh, who had met with Mr. Baker earlier. This seemed to suggest that a timetable was emerging by consensus, projecting possible combat early next year if there is not an Iraqi pullout by then. There also appears to be widespread agreement that an explicit Security Council resolution authorizing force should be adopted before military action is mounted.
[Further increasing Washington's pressure on Iraq to leave Kuwait, Pentagon officials said today they would add 100,000 troops to the force in the gulf region by the end of the year, bringing the number of American forces there to about 350,000. Page A15]
In the interview, Mr. Mubarak's sense of betrayal by Mr. Hussein and by King Hussein of Jordan came through clearly, and in effect, provided some of the emotional backdrop to his strong anti-Iraq position.
Mr. Mubarak, 62 years old, used the almost two-hour-long interview at the 19th century, Moorish-style Kuba Palace to send a plea and an urgent warning to President Hussein not to doubt the international commitment to liberate Kuwait. Mr. Mubarak said that as a military man since 1949, he understood all too well the consequences of a military clash.
"The problem of Saddam Hussein is that he is one man against the world and even against himself simply because he does not realize the real danger around him," Mr. Mubarak said. "And his entourage is not briefing him adequately."
In the wide-ranging interview in his ceremonial office, President Mubarak presented the most detailed account to date of his efforts to prevent the gulf crisis and later to resolve it. He discussed previously secret messages and other contacts with Iraq aimed, he said, at saving the man who had repeatedly misled and betrayed him. He sketched a terrifying portrait of Arab politics, including betrayals by Arab leaders who had previously called him their Arab brother.
And he categorically rejected accounts of the early days of the crisis, which were sympathetic to the Iraqi point of view, presented by King Hussein of Jordan in a series of interviews last month.
Desperate Search For a Way Out Visibly angered at the Iraqis as he recounted events before and after the crisis, Mr. Mubarak, a solidly built man, spoke in controlled terms, choosing his words carefully in English, gesturing broadly and emphatically with his powerful hands to underscore his determination.
He emphasized that after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait on Aug. 2, he had repeatedly tried without success to find a "face-saving" way out for Saddam Hussein. "I was trying to help him," Mr. Mubarak declared. Even today, he said, he would welcome the Iraqi leader in Egypt as part of an effort to find such a face-saving solution.
But he would not go to Baghdad on such a mission, he said, nor would he countenance any effort to permit President Hussein to withdraw less than totally from the sheikdom that his forces have occupied and plundered for the last three months. That is why, he said, he could not countenance a call last week by the Soviet President, Mikhail S. Gorbachev, for an Arab summit meeting.
"Why an Arab summit?" Mr. Mubarak asked. "What would we do there? We won't give a blessing for his occupation.
"That is what he wants," Mr. Mubarak said, referring to President Hussein. "I'll never give it to him. It's a matter of principle."
"We have done everything we can do," he added. "The answer from the Iraqi Government has been insults and dirty words against me. Either he doesn't realize the tremendous forces being arrayed against him, or his aides are misleading him or not telling him."
 
 Fate of Egyptians In Iraq Lamented
 The Egyptian President, who came to power after the assassination of Anwar el-Sadat in October 1981 and who is entering his 10th year in office, excoriated Iraq for its treatment of some of the million-plus Egyptians who have worked for years in Iraq, often in the military and in other vital jobs. After the Iran-Iraq war ended in 1988, he said, 300 to 400 Egyptians -- as many as 8 or 9 a day -- had been killed in incidents by Iraqis.
"They were returning them in coffins," the President said. "Hundreds and hundreds of coffins."
Since Aug. 2, he said, "some 270,000 Egyptians have returned from Kuwait and Iraq, many having lost all of their savings and possessions."
Eygpt had privately protested the deaths several times through the Foreign Ministry, Mr. Mubarak said, but he had not spoken out. "I kept silent," he said. "I closed my mouth. I didn't want to create problems for them or turn public opinion against them."
The President also disclosed that two weeks ago he had secured the return of 34 Egyptian pilots in Iraq after repeated and vociferous diplomatic protests. The Egyptians, who had been teaching and training Iraqi pilots, had been under house arrest since Aug. 2. All Egyptian military advisers have now left Iraq, the President said.
Mr. Mubarak said that military assistance to Iraq dated to President Sadat's time in office. During the Iran-Iraq war, he said, Egypt supplied "lots of assistance" to Iraq -- ammunition, guns, military hardware and defensive weapons. Given this extensive cooperation, the President said, he doubted that Mr. Hussein possessed, as he has maintained, medium- and long-range missiles capable of delivering chemical weapons.
"Those who have such weapons don't boast about them," he said.
While he refused to discuss Iraq's military potential in any detail, he expressed confidence in the coalition's ability to win any military confrontation with Iraq. "We know them," he said. "I am not afraid of them."
Asked whether, in the event of war, Egyptian forces would fight with the Americans, Mr. Mubarak replied: "We will fight with the Saudis. Our forces are coordinated with the Saudis."
 
 Help for the Saudis: Troops and Tanks
 Mr. Mubarak said that he had already sent to Saudi Arabia a division -- about 15,000 army troops -- and a battalion of Thunderball forces, roughly 400 special troops. He said he would send another tank division -- about 400 tanks and 7,000 men -- by the end of the month to bolster Egypt's presence in the kingdom.
An official close to the President also disclosed that soon after the invasion, Mr. Mubarak quietly sent 2,200 Thunderball troops to Saudi Arabia at King Fahd's request. Mr. Mubarak warned the Saudi King on Friday, Aug. 3, that two Iraqi brigades were heading for his border. The King then called President Bush, who confirmed the information on Iraqi troop movements.
"King Fahd immediately requested troops from both the U.S. and from Egypt, and both complied immediately without making any announcement," the official said.
Mr. Mubarak also dismissed reports of tension within the coalition against Iraq. Syria, he said, was now transporting more troops to the Saudi desert, and would not abandon the coalition despite its criticism of increased American arms shipments to Israel. "I know him very well," Mr. Mubarak said of the Syrian President, Hafez al-Assad. "He will stick with us."
Asked whether the nations allied against President Hussein could hold together for two or three more months in the face of Iraqi pressure to split the coalition and neutralize its members, Mr. Mubarak replied that the coalition would hold.
 
 Jordanian's Account Is Called Inaccurate
 His normally husky voice boomed with indigation as he disputed recent statements by King Hussein of Jordan that President Mubarak had undermined his peace-making efforts. In interviews last month, the King said that by condemning Iraq's invasion after the King had secured a pledge from Saddam Hussein to withdraw from Kuwait in exchange for an Arab meeting, President Mubarak had destroyed prospects for an early, peaceful solution to the crisis.
The Egyptian President's account of events before and after the crisis differed markedly in several important respects from the Jordanian King's. Mr. Mubarak said that he had been concerned for several months about growing tension between Iraq and Kuwait. On July 24, he went to Baghdad to assess Iraq's intentions. He said that Saddam Hussein had assured him unequivocally that he would not invade Kuwait. "He told me: 'I frightened them. They are terrified. I'm not going to do anything more.' "
King Hussein suggested that President Mubarak may have misinterpreted President Hussein's assurances. The King quoted the Iraqi leader as having told Mr. Mubarak that he would not act against Kuwait as long as negotiations to resolve their differences continued.
Mr. Mubarak bristled at this suggestion. "There was no misunderstanding," he said. "Those who told that to you were not there. This was a tete-a-tete discussion. I never tell lies. Had he said I will do nothing as long as the two sides are meeting, I would have said, and what will you do afterward? I would not just have left things like that."
Based on Saddam Hussein's assurances, he said, he flew to Kuwait to inform Kuwaiti officials of his discussions, despite President Hussein's request that his peaceful intentions not be passed on to them. He told Sheik Jaber al-Ahmed al-Sabah, the Emir, and the Crown Prince, that "they had to do something for him," meaning for Saddam Hussein. Mr. Mubarak said he urged the Kuwaitis to "solve the problem over their borders and be ready to give him some money." The Kuwaitis, he said, did not reply, but he felt confident that they would try to settle things peacefully, he said.
Because of President Hussein's assurances, he said, "I was shocked, astonished when my aides called me at 5 in the morning to say Iraq had invaded Kuwait. "I was very offended, very upset."
 
 The 'Arab Brother' Would Be Upset
 On the day of the invasion, King Hussein flew to Alexandria, Egypt, where the two leaders met. "I told him that we had to find a face-saver for him," Mr. Mubarak said of Saddam Hussein. The King argued that their "Arab brother" in Baghdad would be "very upset" if Egypt or the Arab League foreign ministers who were meeting in Cairo condemned the invasion without giving him a chance to explain his case.
Mr. Mubarak said that "with great difficulty, I persuaded King Fahd and the others to postpone an Arab League vote for at least a day." He than proposed that King Hussein go to Baghdad and tell Saddam Hussein that he would call for a limited Arab summit meeting to resolve issues of contention between Kuwait and Iraq, if President Hussein would "whisper in our ears" that he was willing to withdraw his forces and restore the ruling family in Kuwait.
"King Hussein was hesitant," Mr. Mubarak recounted. "I phoned Saddam Hussein in front of him and told him of my proposal, and that King Hussein would visit him that night or tomorrow to explain further."
King Hussein's version of events is that on Friday, Aug. 3, he flew to Baghdad and secured a commitment from President Hussein to withdraw from most of Kuwait and to discuss other grievances at an Arab meeting on Sunday, provided the Arab League and its more influential members did not condemn his invasion or call for foreign intervention.
Mr. Mubarak's recollection differs. He said that King Hussein called him at 3:45 P.M. on Friday to say that President Hussein had agreed to the limited Arab summit and that he wanted it to be held on Sunday.
"I asked him: what about the two points?" Mr. Mubarak said, referring to the commitment to withdraw and restore the legitimate Government of Kuwait. He said the King told him: "I didn't discuss the details with him," referring to Saddam Hussein.
These two points were hardly details, he had replied. "How could I call for a summit," Mr. Mubarak continued, "under these circumstances?"
 
At Home, Pressures Of Public Opinion
 Egyptians, he said, were clamoring for a declaration condemning the invasion. "Everyone wanted to know what Egypt's position was. So I condemned it." Later that night, the Arab League foreign ministers took similar action.
Replying to King Hussein's assertion that on Sunday, Aug. 5, Iraq began withdrawing its forces, Mr. Mubarak declared: "There was no withdrawal. They were taking military and other equipment back to Baghdad."
On Monday, Aug. 6, Mr. Mubarak said that he summoned the Iraqi Ambassador to Alexandria to tell him to warn Saddam Hussein that his situation was precarious, that the whole world would be against him. "I said please tell that man I'm willing to do anything to save his face if he will withdraw."
At 2 A.M. on Aug. 7, the Ambassador flew to Baghdad to deliver the message. He returned later that morning with an Iraqi Vice President. "I told them again: We're trying to find a way out for you. If it would help, I would make an appeal in the name of Islam, whatever I could do to help.
"But he said that I had cut their throats," he said, quoting the Iraqi vice president. "I said how? He said by condemning the invasion. I told him it had been a matter of principle. Even if our brothers did that, Egypt would have to stand against that. People here felt it deeply; I couldn't risk our credibility by endorsing your invasion."
Mr. Mubarak said that no matter what he said, the Iraqi replied: "No, this is our land. Historically, it's ours. No. No. No. It's our land."
The Egyptian President said that despite the loss of $9 billion to $10 billion in revenue as a result of the gulf crisis, Egypt would not change its stance because the sovereignty of nations and nonintervention in the affairs of other nations were principles that had to be observed in the "new world order" evolving after the end of the cold war.
"I did what I had to do," he said.

HEADLINE: Architect Picked for Newark Concert Hall

BYLINE: By GLENN COLLINS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: NEWARK, Nov. 7

 BODY:
In appointing an architect today to design the first major new East Coast performance hall in three decades, the New Jersey Performing Arts Center took a firm step toward creating a $70 million multi-use concert hall in downtown Newark.
It would be the first building of a Lincoln Center-like complex near Newark's central business district. However, it is intended to be less an isolated cultural enclave than many other urban performance centers, and more a fully integrated element of the cityscape. 
 "I hope this room will serve as the soul of the city, and as a catalyst for its continuing renaissance," said Barton Myers, a 56-year-old Los Angeles architect who was chosen to create the 2,700-seat hall.
The hall, to be completed in 1996, would be a home for music, dance and theater. It would also house the New Jersey Symphony and would include rehearsal spaces, restaurants and cafes. More important, said Newark's Mayor, Sharpe James, it would also be "a keystone for Newark's renewal over the next three decades."
The plan envisions the arts as a magnet to attract suburbanites to an urban core that has suffered severe erosion of its economic base, hoping that cultural offerings can succeed where traditional development has not.
 "For too long," Mayor James said yesterday, " the people of New Jersey have had to travel to New York or Philadelphia to participate in world-class cultural events."
 
Public and Private Money
 In the first stage of development, in addition to the $70 million for the performance hall, another $70 million will be required for site work, including the construction of a plaza and the refurbishment of a 1,100-space parking garage in Military Park. "We are aware that an evening at the arts center starts and ends in an automobile," said Mr. Goldman, "and this will be the best parking garage on the East Coast."
Only part of the money is in hand. Newark's business community has pledged $33 million toward the arts center's construction, and Gov. Jim Florio has pledged $20 million in low-interest bonds to buy the 12 acres of land and do site reconstruction.
The Federal Government has also committed $1.2 million to planning, design and construction of the outdoor spaces, said Lawrence P. Goldman, the president of the New Jersey Performing Arts Center. The remainder of the money will come from fund-raising efforts across the state, Mr. Goldman said.
 This year, the consulting firm of Hamilton, Rabinovitz & Altschuler, which estimated the economic impact of the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center in Manhattan, predicted that the performing arts center might generate $1 billion in new economic development for New Jersey.
The arts complex, as originally proposed by Gov. Thomas H. Kean in 1987, would ultimately include the concert hall, a 3,000-seat opera house, a 1,800-seat music theater, a 600- to-750-seat dance and drama theater, and a 200-seat children's theater. The center is to be set in a new park sloping down to the Passaic River, with an open plaza larger than that at Rockefeller Center or Lincoln Center.
 
Hotel to Be Demolished
 The old Military Hotel in Newark is to be razed to provide part of the space for the concert hall, which would occupy two acres on Park Place and Saybrook Place across from Military Park. The 12-acre site for the entire arts complex includes the knoll upon which Newark's Puritan founders first set foot in 1666.
More than 4.5 million people live within 25 miles of the site, the study said, and predicted that 650,000 people would be drawn annually to arts events in downtown Newark by 2003 if the construction stayed on schedule.
Mr. Myers, a professor of architecture at the University of California at Los Angeles, was selected over three other finalists for the job: the architects Michael Graves of Princeton, N.J., Benjamin Thompson of Cambridge, Mass., and Cesar Pelli of New Haven.
Mr. Myers's firm was the principal designer of two new theaters at the Portland Center for the Performing Arts in Oregon, which includes a 2,700-seat concert hall, a 950-seat lyric theater and a 400-seat courtyard theater. Mr. Myers's firm also designed the $40 million Cerritos Community Arts Center in Southern California, a 1,800-seat multi-purpose hall scheduled for completion in 1991.
 
Works in Foreign Countries
 In addition, his firm has won the contract to design the $40 million United States Pavilion at Expo '92 in Seville, Spain. Mr. Myers is also the designer of the Citadel Theater in downtown Edmonton, Alberta, and he designed major additions to the Stratford Festival Theater, the national home of the Shakespeare Festival in Canada.
"Of course, no one building can turn a city around," said Mr. Myers, "but if done well, so it fits in with the community, it can make an important contribution to change."
The selection committee "did not want the center to turn its back, architecturally, to the city of Newark," said Mr. Goldman. "Though Kennedy Center is a wonderful place," he said of the arts complex in Washington, "it stands as an island that has nothing to do with the city around it."
At first, the selection committee "had in mind a hall like the Sydney Opera House, that would be instantly recognizable as a symbol of the city and of Australia as well," said Mr. Goldman. "However, Barton convinced us that an equally important goal was an arts center that would be welcoming and people friendly, and that would fit in comfortably and naturally with the fabric of the city."
 
'A Focus for the City'
 Mr. Myers said that it would take 20 to 24 months to design the hall, and that he would spend part of that time getting to know the city and New Jersey's arts groups. He said he would like the hall to be "a great room for the performing arts, a focus for the city." He added that in the other performance halls he has designed, "the lobbies are stages and the performers are the audiences themselves."
The multi-use hall, Mayor James said, will be the bridge between many of the cultural and business landmarks that are part of Newark's downtown revival.
They include the Newark Museum on Washington Street, with its recent $21 million reconstruction by Mr. Graves; the Gateway Center office complex where WNET, Channel 13, is, Symphony Hall and the bustling spaces of Newark's Pennsylvania Station, the railway hub for commuter and Amtrak trains to and from the rest of New Jersey and New York City.
 
Proximity to the Station
 The station, adjacent to Newark's Ironbound district with its Portuguese shops and restaurants, would be a 10-minute walk from the arts center.
The master plan for the entire Performing Arts Center, being designed by Skidmore, Owings & Merrill and James Stewart Polshek & Partners, is to be completed before the end of the year. More than $220 million would be required for the beginning phases of construction.

Big East, Bigger Business

BYLINE: William C. Rhoden

 BODY:
The Big East Conference held its annual media day in New York City yesterday: same format, different players, same coaching alibis. But this year, one major player was not on hand. Dave Gavitt, the founder and commissioner of the Big East, resigned earlier this year to become the general manager of the Boston Celtics.
Gavitt's presence in the Big East was as imposing as that of Walter Byers in the National Collegiate Athletic Association. He organized and nurtured the concept of getting nine loosely organized institutions in the Northeast corridor to form a basketball conference in an instant talent cartel. 
 The conference has become a multimillion-dollar success and has come to epitomize the very essence of big-time basketball.
So Gavitt is gone and yesterday Mike Tranghese, a clever, cordial man who had been Gavitt's left and right hand, presided over his first media day as the Big East commissioner.
Tranghese has had a fierce baptism. One of the first challenges he faced was the threatened disintegration of the conference. With the recent scramble by college football powers to align themselves with better conferences to attract better television packages, some of the major independents joined leagues. Boston College, Syracuse and Pittsburgh, members of the Big East who who competed as independents in football, made noise about forming new affiliations.
Suddenly, the Big East, which seemed so invincible five seasons ago when three of its nine teams reached the Final Four, was in danger of being raided or deserted, unless the new commissoner made a bold move.
Tranghese resisted expansion at first. But when it became clear that the three football schools were unhappy with the Big East's focus on basketball -- and planned to do something about it -- the commissioner reached out and plucked the University of Miami. Effectively, that kept B.C., Pitt and Syracuse in the conference.
Yesterday, though, Tranghese conceded that the move troubled him and continues to trouble him because it violated the geographic integrity that had been a cornerstone of the Big East.
"The one hangup I had as we talked with Miami was this geographic incompatibility. But when I looked at it, I said if I don't take Miami and I lose Syracuse and Pitt, where am I going to get replacements?"
As schools and conferences make moves based primarily on economics, players are beginning to look more closely at sums of money passing over, around, behind and underneath them.
Nearly every coach at a major Division I program has a shoe and or clothing contract in which he is paid in exchange for the team's wearing a certain brand of shoes or in some cases uniforms.
Oliver Taylor, a junior guard for Seton Hall, said most players hardly question the practice. "All the players know is that these are a pair of sneakers that the team is wearing," he said. "They don't understand that these are shoes that you have to wear, regardless of whether they fit or not, because the coach has a contract with the shoe company."
Taylor recalled that last season some of the players didn't like the uniforms that the Pirates wore in a nationally televised game. Even though he said "it was like a commercial for Nike," Taylor assumed that since there was a contract between the coach and the company, they would simply go along.
"A lot of times, you're just thankful that you got a scholarship and you're saving your parents $18,000 a year," he said. "But I feel we should get more financial aid or benefits."
Many people are troubled by college athletes' asking for more. But at a time when athletic departments and coaches are making grandstand plays for revenue, athletes are developing a savvy business awareness at best, a pronounced mercenary attitude at worst.
What concerns Tranghese about the Big East's curious geographic meandering is a perception by the public that the conference is no longer what it purports to be. He complained throughout the interviews that reporters were so interested in disucssing the league's expansion that he hadn't even got around to discussing basketball.
"That's what I want to talk about, but it's naive," he said. "This is a big business, and that's why I'm being paid what I'm paid. But it's bothersome and it's a concern because people get turned off to it being viewed as just a business."
In fact, big-time college sports is precariously close to being viewed as a business by the Internal Revenue Service, which is already looking at the tax-exempt status of various college football bowl organizations. Soon, the I.R.S. will examine the relationship between the athlete and the university. If it is, in fact, a business, who is the employee who is the employer? And is the scholarship effectively a contract?
What's even more interesting is that the questions are not only being asked by outsiders, but increasingly by the troops.

HEADLINE: ESSAY;
The Bush Victory

BYLINE: By William Safire

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
The only time Richard Nixon quoted Walter Lippmann, not his favorite pundit, was the day after the midterm elections of 1970 in which the Republicans lost nine House seats.
"Walter Lippmann said that according to the rules of the political game as it has been played in this country for the past 50 years," said the President, reading from some gems of research I had handed him, 
 "When the party in power loses little if anything in an off-year election, it has to be called a victory."
History has repeated itself; the party in power in the White House has just lost nine House seats in the midterm election, not the usual 36. Therefore, according to the Lippmann Rule, President Bush has the right to call the 1990 results a victory.
But just let him try it. The mindset that drives most interpretations of the results envisions a wounded politician in the White House, coattails in tatters and inflated ratings plummeting, his plums ripening for plucking in 1992. Having taken credit for the rain, Mr. Bush is now getting blamed for the drought.
Clear your mindset. For a man about to be the first to occupy the White House during a wartime recession, George Bush is in pretty good shape.
In his defining domestic moment, he stripped his party of its philosophy by caving in on his tax pledge -- but disaster did not befall Republicans.
In pressing the advantage handed them by Desperation Darman, Democratic liberals reverted to the soak-the-rich pitch of their glory days -- but their retreaded fairness issue led to no day of glory.
In retrospect, Mr. Bush might wish he had stuck to his guns and fought this election on a taxing-vs.-spending theme; most returns show voter displeasure aimed more at increased taxes than unincreased services. But let's keep our sextant fixed on Lipp-mann's guiding star: massive erosion averted is midterm victory.
Another, crueler adage buttresses this wisdom, which I hope some pundit a generation hence will refer to as the Safire Rule of Relative Positioning: No politician is safely a success until all his potential opponents are failures. Consider the state of the '92 opposition in light of the '90 results.
With his campaign coffers overflowing, Mario Cuomo, who in his previous campaign won over 65 percent of the votes for Governor of New York, this time eked out a bare majority over a couple of relatively impoverished opponents; the much-derided Republican, Pierre Rinfret, stunned his scoffers by receiving twice as many votes as the pollsters predicted. The dismal Cuomo showing has forced the Governor's national boosters to eat humble pie with melancholy danish.
Equally heavily financed Bill Bradley, his aim fixed on the Presidential nomination, took his eye off the tax-cutting ball and dribbled away a big lead in New Jersey against an unknown. His disenthralled supporters say wryly he can no longer depend on a charismatic oratorical style alone.
Senator Al Gore won handily in Tennessee. But the issue he is counting on to catapult him to the nomination is global warming -- and environmentalists lost their "Big Green" push in California by 2 to 1, which greens everywhere consider a polit-ecological disaster. (However, if it's 90 in the shade in New York on New Year's Day -- keep your eye on Gore.)
Those eager to proclaim the President damaged in this election should turn to a Lincoln adage: You cannot beat somebody with nobody. This election may have diminished the Somebody, but it has surely slammed around the Nobodies.
Perhaps you are unsatisfied with the notion that not losing badly is really winning. Surely you cannot prefer drawing such lessons as "nobody won" or "everybody lost." Does the campaign result have any meaning?
Yes. Remember how the reformist goo-goos were bewailing the way incumbents could use perks and PAC's to keep themselves entrenched? They were right. And remember how all the pollsters and analysts were telling us how fed up the voters were with the budget messiness? They were right, too.
The inertial power of incumbency is still the Immovable Object. Resentment of deadlocking and secretive and promise-breaking politicians is the Irresistible Force. In the campaign of 1990, they met. Result: The little loss by the party in power has to be called a victory.

HEADLINE: Two Missing Landslides

 BODY:
Two of the Democratic Party's most promising candidates stumbled Tuesday on the road to the 1992 convention. In view of their overwhelming victories the last time each ran, landslides seemed certain for both Mario Cuomo and Bill Bradley. Both won; but, as Mr. Bradley might say about a sloppy basketball game, they "won ugly" -- and certainly not by landslides.
Running for a third term against Nobody and Another Nobody, Governor Cuomo collected only 53 percent of the vote, a stunning drop from 65 percent in 1986. Mr. Bradley, who won 64 percent of the vote in 1984, was returned to the Senate by a majority that was at most 51 percent. 
 Why? Surely one common thread was that neither conducted much of a campaign. Instead of grappling with real issues, they offered hollow virtues. Mr. Bradley's ads said more about Mikhail Gorbachev's economic problems than New Jersey's. Mr. Cuomo debated his adversaries on a Sunday afternoon, opposite a football telecast, and spent much of his time mocking them.
Mr. Cuomo's non-landslide has shaken his aura of invincibility and surprised New York's Republicans, who gave up before they started by nominating the embarrassingly unprepared Pierre Rinfret. Mr. Cuomo spent $4 million -- three times the combined expenditures of Mr. Rinfret and the Conservative candidate, Herbert London. Yet he failed to persuade New Yorkers to vote for the environmental bond issue he called his own, wrest the State Senate from Republicans and elect a Democratic Comptroller, Carol Bellamy.
One reason for the limp Democratic results is probably a poor turnout of, notably, Democratic voters. Only 34 percent of this year's vote came from overwhelmingly Democratic New York City. In 1986, the figure was 45 percent.
Mr. Cuomo himself offers voter discontent as the main reason, and there may be some truth to that. Even so, he's not likely to get far in a Presidential bid if his state fails to rebound. No fair-minded New Yorker would blame him for the state's economic plight. But only he has the authority to make the difficult decisions that are necessary but that he likes to avoid.
The same advice applies to Mr. Bradley, who suffered from the perception that he avoided tough issues. Voter fury about taxes surely accounted for much of the tide that nearly swamped the Senator. Voters seemed determined to punish someone for the record $2 billion tax increase the new Democratic Governor, Jim Florio, pushed into law in January.
Mr. Bradley amassed a $12 million campaign kitty, one of the largest in the nation. Yet with far smaller resources, the Republican candidate, Christine Todd Whitman, ran a brave and aggressive campaign and very nearly won.
The figures in both races are good news for President Bush; two of his most promising potential opponents are thus tarnished. But it would be glib to dismiss the 1992 chances of either the Governor or the Senator. The big question for the Democrats remains: Who would be more promising? Meanwhile, the voters made clear that both men have work to do.

HEADLINE: Syracuse Starts Long Road Back From Environmental Blight

 BODY:
To the Editor:
From Syracuse, you report (Oct. 17): "Just moments from the heart of downtown oozes Oil City, an industrial wasteland of oil tanks, junkyards, toxic dumps and corroded buildings hugging the shore of Onondaga Lake, itself a hazardous waste site."
And: "Now despite haunting environmental and economic hurdles, city officials and developers -- in particular, the Pyramid Companies, the mall-development giant based here -- have joined to remake the 800-acre eyesore into what they hope will be the city's salvation."
I would like to put to rest concerns your article raises about New York State's evaluation of actions on environmental problems and health issues at the new Carousel Center mall in Syracuse.
In addition to serving as a symbolic and substantive turning point in the reclamation and revitalization of the area, Pyramid's cleanup and construction in development of the mall -- with stringent regulatory oversight -- have had important environmental and public health benefits.
The actions Pyramid has taken to remove and remediate contaminants, and establish the physical structures of the mall, have rendered the site appropriate for its purpose.
The work is achieving the objectives of a standard cleanup action -- removal of the source of contamination and long-term isolation of low-level residuals. Over the last two years, more than 200 samples have been taken at the site. Only a handful showed isolated pockets of contaminants at levels of concern, and these have been removed and disposed of appropriately.
Although Pyramid still has to complete treatment of soils off the mall property, implement a landscaping plan and carry on long-term operation of ground-water treatment facilities, the company has indicated its commitment to these actions.
While the Department of Environmental Conservation's relationship with Pyramid has at times been contentious, our oversight role, together with those of other government agencies, insures that the mall will provide a safe environment for public use. With completion of this first step in reclamation of Oil City, we can see opportunity to bring back other properties in the area and even a restored Onondaga Lake.

HEADLINE: THE 1990 ELECTIONS: Ballot Proposals;
Voters Spurn Array of Plans For Protecting Environment

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR

 BODY:
Environmentalists said yesterday that they had suffered major setbacks as voters in California and several other states rejected ballot proposals to protect air, land and water against pollution and the effects of commercial development.
Voters also spurned ballot proposals calling for tax cuts or limits on government spending in Massachusetts, Nebraska, Utah and Colorado. 
 But Colorado voters overwhelmingly approved a ballot measure to limit the number of terms of elected officials, including members of Congress, and California voters also approved a proposal to limit the number of terms of elected state officials. That vote was 52 percent to 48 percent.
In general, it was not a good year for ballot measures.
 
'Voters Are Uneasy'
 D. Reid Wilson, political director of the Sierra Club, said voters rejected nearly all environmental proposals on the ballot, including the "Big Green" initiative in California, sometimes described as the most ambitious environmental measure ever offered in the United States. A separate proposal to preserve forests in California, a stream-protection referendum in Missouri, a land use planning measure in Washington State, a recycling proposal in Oregon and an environmental bond issueof nearly $2 billion in New York also went down to defeat.
"Voters are uneasy about the unsettled state of the economy, about whether we will be at war or peace in the Persian Gulf," said Mr. Wilson, whose environmental group has 620,000 members, "and they are unwilling to reach out and embrace new programs, especially if they think there might be some economic consequence to it."
"Big Green," the nation's most closely watched ballot proposition, was "so comprehensive and far-reaching that it ended up uniting all the polluters," Mr. Wilson said. "Industry opponents of Big Green outspent supporters by a margin of more than 2 to 1," he said.
Jim Maddy, executive director of the League of Conservation Voters, a political action committee for the environmental movement, said some of the environmental proposals this year had invited attack because they were "unbelievably long and complicated, with pages and pages of fine print."
Kirk West, president of the California State Chamber of Commerce, said opponents of "Big Green" had "convinced the voters that it tried to do too much, covered too many subjects."
In New York, the vote rejecting the environmental bond issue left municipal officials around the state with the problem of finding money to pay for state-mandated landfill and recycling programs. Communities like New York City faced the prospect of having to increase property taxes and fees.
Here is a summary of results for other major proposals on the ballot on Tuesday:
 
Taxing and Spending
 Massachusetts voters rejected a major tax-cutting proposal, which would have required substantial cutbacks in social welfare services to residents of the state, which has been hard hit by layoffs and economic troubles. The proposal, sponsored by Citizens for Limited Taxation, would have nullified recent tax increases, cut the state income-tax rate and reduced fees charged by state agencies, forcing the state to slash more than $2 billion from its $13.4 billion budget next year.
Margaret Keiley, a psychotherapist interviewed outside her polling place in the South End of Boston on Tuesday, said that the state and the nation needed to revise their economic priorities, but that the tax-cutting measure was "just a mindless way" to do it.
Homeless people said they opposed the Massachusetts tax proposal because it almost surely would have forced the state to cut back social welfare benefits and shelters for the homeless.
John P. Keast, a policy analyst at the conservative Free Congress Foundation, who tabulated results of the statewide ballot measures, said: "People are looking at their pocketbooks more and more. Citizens are unsure of the impact of some of these tax initiatives. The average voter wants to be sure there are guaranteed government services if the economy gets any worse."
Oregon bucked the national trend and approved a measure imposing limits on property taxes. State officials predicted it would lead to substantial reductions in such taxes over the next five years.
But in other states, voters turned down ballot measures to cut taxes and spending. California, which started the nationwide tax revolt 12 years ago, rejected a proposal that would have made it much more difficult for state and local officials to raise taxes. Colorado defeated a proposal that would have required explicit approval from the voters for any state or local tax increase. Nebraska rejected a proposed amendment to the state constitution that would have limited increases in state and local government spending to 2 percent a year.
 
Abortion
 Abortion rights advocates fared well, defeating two Oregon ballot proposals to restrict access to abortion while prevailing in their effort to codify the right to abortion in Nevada.
Kate Michelman, executive director of the National Abortion Rights Action League, described the results as "important victories for the pro-choice community nationwide."
One Oregon proposal would have banned abortion, except where a pregnancy resulted from rape or incest or endangered the life of the woman. The other would have required doctors to notify a parent at least two days before performing an abortion on a minor.
The proposal in Nevada was put on the ballot by supporters of the right to abortion. Approval of that measure protects the current law, which permits a woman to have an abortion within 24 weeks after the start of a pregnancy. The referendum on Tuesday assures that Nevada cannot further restrict the right to abortion "except by a direct vote of the people."
 
Term Limits
 Oklahoma became the first state to limit the tenure of elected officials when it voted in September to set a 12-year limit on service in the State Legislature.
On Tuesday, Colorado voters decided to set limits of eight years' service for elected state officials, including state legislators. The measure also limits members of Congress from Colorado to terms of 12 consecutive years.
The measure won easily, by 71 percent to 29 percent. But Steven R. Ross, counsel to the Clerk of the United States House of Representatives, said that some of the restrictions were unenforceable because states could not legally go beyond the Federal Constitution in setting qualifications for service in Congress.
Terry Considine, a Colorado State Senator who led the campaign to limit terms, said: "All the people want this kind of change. They know the government isn't working the way it should." Term limits tell legislators they are under a deadline to get things done, he said.
Elsewhere on Tuesday, Californians approved stringent term limits for state officials: six years for members of the State Assembly and eight years for state senators, the governor and other elected state officials. President Bush supported the proposal.
Residents of Kansas City, Mo., limited City Council members and the Mayor to two consecutive four-year terms.
David B. Magleby, a professor of political science at Brigham Young University in Provo, Utah, who has studied ballot measures for a decade, said it was paradoxical that voters had supported such term limitation proposals, but "generally did not use the option they already have to limit terms directly by defeating incumbents."
 
Education
 Oregon voters rejected a proposal to provide a personal income-tax credit up to $1,200 a year for the costs of educating a child at home or in private secular or religious schools. Public school officials in Oregon and other states expressed relief that the proposal had been defeated, by a ratio of more than 2 to 1. They said it could have set a dangerous precedent for indirect public aid to private schools.
Even though the measure was defeated, its presence on the ballot put state education officials on notice that voters wanted better results from the public schools in return for increased spending.
Nebraska voted narrowly to retain a new school financing plan that seeks to reduce disparities in spending by rich and poor school districts. The plan, adopted in April, reduces reliance on property taxes, but will increase state income and sales taxes.
 
Other Measures
 In Florida, voters approved an amendment to the state constitution requiring buyers of pistols to wait three days before getting their weapons. Lawrence Pratt, executive director of Gun Owners of America, which opposed the requirement, said he doubted that it would reduce the crime rate.
Alaskans voted to re-establish criminal penalties for the possession or use of small amounts of marijuana.
Arizonans rejected a proposal to establish a state holiday marking the birthday of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. As a result, they may have lost an opportunity to bring the Super Bowl to their state in 1993. Paul J. Tagliabue, Commissioner of the National Football League, recommended today that the game be played elsewhere.
In the District of Columbia, voters rejected a proposal to give homeless people a legal right to overnight shelter. Opponents said the measure would have made "shelter on demand" an absolute right, draining city funds from other social service programs.
Residents of South Dakota turned down a proposal to limit gold and silver mining in the Black Hills. Arizonans and Minnesotans approved plans to dedicate part of state lottery proceeds to preserving the environment.
Seattle voters retained spousal benefits for unmarried companions of municipal employees. San Franciscans passed a less sweeping measure that allows homosexual couples to register their relationships with the city government, without obtaining the legal benefits of marriage.

HEADLINE: THE 1990 ELECTIONS: North Carolina;
Helms Kindled Anger in Campaign, And May Have Set Tone for Others

BYLINE: By PETER APPLEBOME, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: RALEIGH, Nov. 7

 BODY:
It began as a clash of visions and personalities that seemed startling and new, but when it ended Tuesday, the bitter North Carolina Senate race between the Republican incumbent, Jesse Helms, and the Democratic challenger, Harvey Gantt, gave off the inescapable air of deja vu.
The polls indicate that Mr. Helms turned around a close race with a blitz of negative advertising in the campaign's final days, as he did in the past, creating a groundswell of support from white voters. But just as in the past, particularly in his 1984 Senate race against James B. Hunt, then the Governor, the tactics used by Mr. Helms could be the start of a political trend.
 
Helms Is Widely Imitated
 "The national implication of this race is that the cultural and racial issues Helms raised, such as homosexuals teaching in the classroom and racial quotas, are powerful weapons for the Republican Party," said Mike Donilon, the poll taker for Mr. Gantt. "People have to understand that the questions Helms raised in this election were not revisits to old cultural and racial issues. Instead, they raised some of the toughest battleground issues that will be fought out over the next few years." 
 Mr. Helms, who on Tuesday won a fourth Senate term by a margin of 53 percent to 47 percent, has always occupied an unusual position in American politics. He is at once a politician whose staunch conservatism is well outside the national mainstream and an innovator whose abilities in areas like fund-raising and negative campaigning have been widely admired and imitated. His race against Mr. Gantt, who would have been the first black elected to the Senate from the South since Reconstruction, showed both aspects of his career.
Mr. Helms, the conservative three-term incumbent, was trailing in the polls when he unleashed a barrage of advertising last week linking Mr. Gantt to homosexual causes and saying he supported racial quotas that benefited minority members over whites.
Most powerful was a television ad featuring a white job applicant crumbling a rejection letter as an announcer said the job was given to a less-qualified black because of job quotas, which Mr. Gantt supports. Mr. Gantt denies supporting job quotas.
 
Ads Brought Heavy Turnout
 Experts say Mr. Helms's ads, which were also on radio and in the press, had the effect of both winning over undecided white voters and generating enough enthusiasm among whites to create an extraordinarly heavy turnout, 60 percent of registered voters, comparable to that of a Presidential election.
A poll of 2,194 North Carolina voters condued by Voter Research and Surveys found that of those who decided late in the race, 61 percent went for Mr. Helms. Of those who voted for Mr. Helms, 8 percent said they made their choice last week. Of those who voted for Mr. Gantt, 4 percent said they made their choice last week.
 
Gantt's Message Turned Around
 Analysts say that Mr. Helms's ads and campaign speeches both played on racial fears and turned around Mr. Gantt's message of a worrisome, weakening economy by saying the problems were the results of blacks taking jobs from whites.
"I think that whites do not believe blacks when they say they're in favor of equal opportunity," said Ted Arrington, a professor of political science at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte. "I think whites believe blacks are in favor of equal results and quotas if that helps them get results. That may e unfair, but it's there. It was an issue that allowed Helms to bring race into the election in a way that wasn't offensive to many voters."
Mr. Arrington and others noted that Mr. Gantt's underdog campaign faced numerous other problems as well. He had never run statewide, he had lost his last election as the Charlotte Mayor, and Charlotte is viewed as a liability for Democratic candidates statewide.
Other than race, his biggest problem may have been that Mr. Gantt ran as a liberal, embracing the label more openly as the race wound down. His stands included increased spending for social programs, opposition to the deth penalty and support of abortion rights.
 
A Poll Leader in October
 The Voter Research and Surveys poll showed that 15 percent of respondents called themselves liberals, 44 percent moderates and 38 percent conservatives.
Still, Mr. Gantt was leading in the polls by as much as 8 points late in October. It is clear the polls overstated support for a black, as has happened in other races.
To most observers, Mr. Helms's victory was almost a carbon copy of earlier races in which he polarized the electorate and turned the election into an emotional value-laden choice between his view of North Carolina values and alien values. His vote margin in his four races has varied from 52 percent to 54.5 percent.
 
'Gave Them Plenty to Dislike'
 "Helms know what people dislike, and he gave them plenty to dislike," said Merle Black a professor of politics and government at Emory University. He said he doubted that Mr. Helms's polarizing political approach had much electoral appeal but that his issues, particularly racial quotas, could have broad appeal in more mainstream campaigns.
For North Carolina, the most immediate concern is healing the wounds from a polarizing election. And there were worries, thought none in the Helms camp, about the state's image after a racially explicit race.
For the Democrats, a more long-range question is whether Mr. Helms, who begins every race with more than 40 percent of the electorate adamantly opposed to him, can ever be beaten.
"You have to wonder if anyone can beat the guy in this state," said Thad L. Beyle, a political science professor at the University of North Carolina. "I don't know who else is out there and who would want to try it."

BYLINE: By FOX BUTTERFIELD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BOSTON, Nov. 7

 BODY:
William F. Weld, the first Republican to win the governor's office in Massachusetts in two decades, today savored his narrow victory over John R. Silber and said his first priority would be to repeal a state sales tax on services passed only last summer.
But analysts here said the election was not so much an affirmation of Mr. Weld as a rebuff of Dr. Silber and his abrasive, confrontational style. 
 In a poll of people who had just voted, conducted by the Roper Organization for WCVB-TV in Boston, 51 percent of those who voted for Mr. Weld on Tuesday said they were actually voting against Dr. Silber. And in a poll conducted by Voter Research and Surveys, of 1,999 voters leaving the polls, 30 percent of the Democrats said they had deserted Dr. Silber for Mr. Weld, including 33 percent of those who identified themselves as liberal Democrats.
In a state where registered Democrats outnumber Republicans by 4 to 1, those defections were crucial for Mr. Weld's close triumph.
 
Short List of Priorities
 In a news conference hours after claiming victory early this morning, the 45-year-old Governor-elect outlined a program for a slimmed-down state government, in contrast to the approach of Gov. Michael S. Dukakis, the Democrat whom he will succeed. "I believe in keeping the priority list short," Mr. Weld said.
In his victory speech last night he sounded a similar theme, saying, "I don't believe government should be about the miracle business."
Mr. Weld, a former United States Attorney, defeated Dr. Silber, president of Boston University, 52 percent to 48 percent.
The turnout of 70 percent, or 2.27 million voters, was a record for a non-Presidential election, according to the Secretary of State's office, topping the previous high of 2.14 million, set in 1962.
The large turnout reflected the enormous anger among Massachusetts voters, who have blamed Governor Dukakis and the Democratic-controlled State Legislature for an economy that has stumbled into recession and a prolonged state budget mess.
 
Tax-Cutting Move Defeated
 But despite this wrath, a tax-cutting referendum was defeated, 60 percent to 40 percent. The referendum would have forced the new governor to cut the $13.4 billion state budget by $1.2 billion next year and a further $2.4 billion in 1992.
Mr. Weld had strongly supported the ballot measure, while Dr. Silber had opposed it, making it a major part of his campaign. So the rejection of the tax-slashing plan by voters who also cast their ballots for Mr. Weld was seen as a further rebuff of Dr. Silber.
Lou DiNatale, a fellow at the McCormack Institute of Public Affairs at the University of Massachusetts in Boston, said the turning point in the campaign came last week, after the final debate between Dr. Silber and Mr. Weld -- a contest that by all accounts Dr. Silber won easily. Until then, Dr. Silber had been building a lead in the polls, and his aggressive demeanor seemed to fit the public's anger.
But on Thursday, in an informal family setting, Dr. Silber snapped at a popular local television news commentator, Natalie Jacobson, when she asked him to discuss his strengths and weaknesses. "You find a weakness," he replied hotly.
"That showed what people had been saying about Silber's temperament was true," said Mr. DiNatale. To compound his problems, in the same interview Dr. Silber suggested that working women who put their children in child care might be guilty of child neglect.
"The liberals stampeded," Mr. DiNatale said.
Asked today about the incident, Dr. Silber acknowledged that it was costly. But in a news conference he blamed Ms. Jacobson, saying, "She entered my house under false pretenses."
Dr. Silber also asserted that she had distorted the interview in the editing process; he made similar charges about the media throughout the campaign.
In his own news conference today, Governor Dukakis accused Dr. Silber of "blowing the election," saying he had the election all but locked up until his temper ran away with him.
"I'm tempted to say the incompetence of the past week was appalling," the Governor said, deliberately mimicking words that Dr. Silber often applied to him.
For Mr. Weld, the narrowness of his victory and the defeat of the tax-cutting petition he supported will only make his new job harder. Although he said today that he hoped to have a program of tax cuts ready by January, when he assumes office, it is unclear how far he will press to carry out plans he put forward in the campaign to shrink the state government.

Four Issues and How They Played at the Polls Before Uncertain Voters;
Taxes: Voters Send Mixed Message

BYLINE: By SUSAN F. RASKY

 BODY:
The message voters sent politicians on taxes and the economy was a muddled one, reflecting discontent with the way economic policy is being run but offering no clear signal on how they would like to see Federal or local budgetary problems solved.
In six states, Massachusetts, California, Montana, Nebraska, Colorado and Utah, voters rejected ballot measures that would have limited taxes or new spending. But voters also rejected measures that would have increased sales or excise taxes, even when such levies were dedicated to popular causes like fighting crime or drugs. 
 "Who knows what it means?" said a Democratic strategist in the Senate. "I think it's pretty hard to find the common thread here. Look at Massachusetts. You have voters rejecting a tax rollback and then turning around and electing for governor the candidate who supported it."
Incumbent governors who entered office pledging not to raise taxes and then switched course paid a high price. In Kansas, the challenger, Joan Finney, a Democrat, ousted Gov. Mike Hayden; in Nebraska, Gov. Kay Orr, a Republican, lost to the Democrat, Ben Nelson, and in Florida, Gov. Bob Martinez, a Republican, was defeated by Lawton Chiles, a Democrat.
 A Close Call for Bradley
In New Jersey, Senator Bill Bradley, a Democrat, found himself the target of voters' anger at Gov. Jim Florio, also a Democrat, over large state tax increases. Mr. Bradley only narrowly beat back a challenge from a Republican opponent who had not been regarded as a serious threat.
But even campaigning against tax increases was no guarantee of victory. In Congressional races, voters punished incumbents who had supported the deficit-cutting package approved by Congress last month, as well as those who vigorously opposed it.
Voters in Illinois said no to the gubernatorial bid of Neil Hartigan, a Democrat who promised to cut taxes, and elected James Edgar, a Republican who emphasized the need for more spending for better schools. In the race for Texas governor, Clayton Williams, a Republican who made no tax increases a centerpiece of his campaign, lost to the Democrat, Ann Richards.
"Tax fairness was a pattern," said Robert S. McIntyre, director of Citizens for Tax Justice, a Washington-based research group that receives financial backing from organized labor. Mr. McIntyre cited victories in Minnesota by Paul Wellstone, a liberal Democrat, over Senator Rudy Boschwitz, a Republican; in Vermont by Bernard Sanders, a socialist, over Representative Peter Smith, a Republican, and in Iowa, by the incumbent Senator Tom Harkin over his Republican challenger, Representative Tom Tauke.
"There weren't that many candidates who ran on the tax fairness issue," he said. "But those who did proved for this election and for 1992 that you can run on it and win."
Kevin Phillips, a political consultant who has chronicled the rise and fall of the conservative movement, described the issue as tax populism and said that being on the popular side of it clearly aided liberal Democrats like Senator Paul Simon of Illinois and Carl Levin of Michigan whose re-election bids had seemed shaky early in the year.
A clearer pattern of voter sentiment on the economy might have emerged if the election had been held a week earlier, when Congressional machinations over the Federal budget were still fresh in the public's mind, Mr. Phillips said.
"If you had had the election on Oct. 29, before the President was able to get the soapbox to himself and begin focusing attention on the Persian Gulf, I think you might have seen Republicans lose one or two more Senate seats, maybe six more House seats and another governor or two," he said.

HEADLINE: THE 1990 ELECTIONS: What Went Wrong?;
Bradley Says He Sensed Voter Fury But It Was Too Late to Do Anything

BYLINE: By WAYNE KING, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WOODBRIDGE, N.J., Nov. 7

 BODY:
Senator Bill Bradley said today that a little over a week ago he had detected voters' anger over taxes, the economy and the failure of elected officials -- including possibly himself -- to address the issues, but that it was too late to do anything about it.
Still, the Senator said, he was surprised by the narrowness of his victory Tuesday over Christine Todd Whitman. 
 "I got the message," Mr. Bradley insisted today at a news conference at his campaign headquarters here. "I got the message!"
But he still refused to talk about Gov. Jim Florio's $2.8 billion in tax increases, which sparked the voter anger in New Jersey that grew rapidly into a dislike of politicians in general, even Bill Bradley. It was the Senator's refusal to take a position on the Florio tax package that especially rankled voters, experts said.
 
Wide Lead Dissipated
 Two weeks before the election, Mr. Bradley had held a wide lead in the polls. But in the end he was saved only by a big Democratic vote from Hudson County.
His final margin of victory was 55,180 votes out of 1.9 million cast.
Shortly after Mr. Bradley began detecting signs of voter discontent, his ads on television abruptly turned negative. They attacked Mrs. Whitman's own record on taxes, accusing her of favoring tax increases when she was a Somerset County Freeholder.
 
Negative Ads Defended
 The Senator defended that decision today. "You hit me with an elbow, I return the elbow," the former Knicks star said. "Get an elbow, give an elbow."
Mr. Bradley, in an interview and later in the news conference, said his campaign staff did its last tracking poll -- a sampling of voter sentiment to detect shifts and trends -- on Oct. 26. That showed him with 58 percent of the vote, compared with 65 percent in his 1984 re-election campaign.
"Basically we picked up some problems," he said, "but frankly we didn't pick up as much in the poll as I picked up on the street campaigning."
Even then, however, he did not realize that the general anger and frustration and fear was focusing in large measure on him, in part because of television commercials that voters were perceiving as insensitive, arrogant and insulting.
 
Low-Key Campaign Backfires
 He was well ahead in polls, and there seemed little reason to change the low-key campaign: Bill Bradley walking on the beach; Bill Bradley, the former Knicks star, shooting a perfect shot on the court; Bill Bradley sitting back in his office and throwing up his heels onto his desk, shod in basketball shoes.
While people still liked Bill Bradley, they felt a bit betrayed. In interviews today, voters said that against the backdrop of the Mideast, the Federal budget deadlock last month and the local tax problems, Mr. Bradley's soft commercials were an insult and an embarrassment.
Allan A. Segal, owner of The Art Gallery in Newark, said Mr. Bradley stirred some resentment by running a campaign that ignored pressing current issues.
"There is so much going on in the world -- locally, nationally and globally -- and there he was in his campaign commercials playing basketball," he said.
Mr. Segal, who voted for Mr. Bradley in the past, said he voted for Mrs. Whitman this time "as a reprimand for his attitude."
 
Easy Victory Expected
 And yet it also appeared that many people who voted against Mr. Bradley to "punish" him did so only because they believed he was assured of victory in any case.
Even though he voted against Mr. Bradley, Mr. Segal said, he "was glad he was elected -- I didn't want to see him defeated."
Michael Kaye, Mr. Bradley's media adviser for all of his campaigns since 1978 and a close friend of the Senator, seemed near tears at one point in a hallway talk with reporters at campaign headquarters.
"Clearly the ads didn't address the issue," he said. " I'm not stupid. I'm not going to say the television was on target.
"No one feels worse about last night than I do, sitting there listening to people talking about these irrelevant ads. Did I sense the Florio thing was a problem? Yes. Do I think we we're dealing with it? No. I think we weren't answering it worth a damn."
 
Late Swing in Attitude
 Large numbers of voters seemed to throw their support to Mrs. Whitman in the volatile last week of the campaign, rejecting Mr. Bradley as they became more familiar with the campaign, said Janice Ballou, director of the Center for Public Interest Polling at Rutgers University.
Her widely respected poll had found Mr. Bradley leading by 26 percentage points in its last survey a week before the election.
But among people who identified themselves as very interested in the campaign, she said, Mr. Bradley led Mrs. Whitman by only 2 percentage points, a hint of things to come that Ms. Ballou said she and others had never published.
Her poll also found that a large majority of voters believed that Governor Florio's tax increases were an issue in the Senate election. "I want to kick myself," she said.
Interviews with voters as they left the polls on Tuesday showed that Mr. Bradley had lost the support of Republicans and independents who had supported him in past races.
 
Some Problem Was Expected
 Mr. Kaye said he and other Bradley advisers were well aware that the Florio tax increase would be a problem for the Senator, even though he had nothing to do with it. But he refused to discuss it, and he would not allow Mr. Kaye to address it in television ads.
"You reach a point where you quit -- especially when you're a friend of his, as I am -- you just quit pestering him," Mr. Kaye said. "Enough already."
"I never said to him, 'If you don't take a postion on this Florio thing, you're a fool,' but everybody knew it was going to cost him," Mr. Kaye said. "But I don't think anybody knew how much it was going to cost him."
Mr. Bradley said at the news conference that he was increasingly aware thatthe Florio tax increase was a major issue transferring voters' anger to him. He also was aware that voters were angry about things in general.
 
Too Late to Change
 "It was like dealing with the many-headed Hydra," he said. "Strike that," he amended, emphasizing that he thought the concerns were entirely proper.
But he said he could not change the thrust of his campaign at the last minute. "We had a strategy, and we used it," he said. "You can't change in the last five days of the campaign."
Indeed, even now, with the election over, he declined to talk about the Florio taxes. "I wouldn't talk about it during the campaign, and I don't think it's appropriate to talk about it when it's over," he said.

Chairman of USF&G Sets Early Retirement

BYLINE: By DANIEL F. CUFF

 BODY:
Jack Moseley, chairman, president and chief executive of the USF&G Corporation, said yesterday that he would take early retirement. At the same time, the insurance company slashed its dividend and announced plans to reduce costs through layoffs.
Mr. Moseley, 59 years old, was not available for comment yesterday, said a spokeswoman at the company's Baltimore headquarters. She added that his move was a personal decision and not related to the dividend reduction and the layoffs. 
 Mr. Moseley plans to stay on until a successor is appointed. The board said it had selected a successor, "an executive of national stature," and would announce the appointment within a few weeks.
USF&G said that it had for two decades maintained the dividend and employment levels through all phases of the insurance-industry cycle, but it added: "The extended duration of the present trough in the property and casualty market and the economic uncertainty resulting from a general business downturn required these extraordinary actions."
The company cut its dividend to 25 cents a share from 73 cents yesterday and adopted a program to cut costs by $75 million. It also reported a third quarter loss of $15 million, compared with a deficit of $17 million in the period last year. On Tuesday the company's share price fell 10 percent on anticipation of the dividend cut. It closed yesterday at 11 5/8 on the New York Stock Exchange, down 5/8.
Mr. Moseley's decision to retire ends a 37-year career that began in Birmingham, Ala., where he started with the company as a trainee after graduation from Auburn University.
Moving up in the actuarial end of the business, he became vice president and senior actuary in 1969 and by 1978 was named president and chief administrative officer. He took over his current titles in 1981.
The company said yesterday that its capital-preserving moves would help to maintain its marketing programs and the quality of its customer service while helping to position it for the next upturn in the underwriting cycle.

HEADLINE: Lemuel Ricketts Boulware, 95; Headed Labor Relations for G.E.

BYLINE: By JOAN COOK

 BODY:
Lemuel Ricketts Boulware, a former vice president of the General Electric Company who formulated a new approach to union management contract negotiations in the 1950's, died yesterday in Delray Beach, Fla. He was 95 years old.
He was under a doctor's care and died at his home, a spokesman for the company said. 
 Mr. Boulware was vice president of employee and public relations at General Electric from 1956 to 1961, when he retired. He had been responsible for employee relations since 1947, a year after the company went through what it considered a disastrous strike,
He helped develop practices in the company's relations with employees, unions, stockholders, community neighbors and government at all levels through a program intended to inform these groups that General Electric was trying "to do right voluntarily."
 
 A 'Fair, Firm Offer'
In a bargaining policy that came to be known as Boulwarism, the company listened closely to union demands, examined the wages and working conditions of competitors, conducted extensive research on all issues and then put forward a "fair, firm offer," with nothing held back for future concessions.
Although General Electric was unhappy with the term "Boulwarism," calling it a "hostile label," the basic bargaining policy that it embraced became the hallmark of the company's dealing with its organized employees in the 1950's and 1960's.
Labor's view of the policy was summed up by Paul Jennings, president of the International Union of Electrical Workers. At a convention of the A.F.L.-C.I.O. in Atlantic City in 1969, he called the policy "telling the workers what they are entitled to and then trying to shove it down their throats."
After a nationwide strike in 1969 and various court decisions that went against General Electric, the company modified its approach the next year and Boulwarism largely faded from the scene.
 
 Views on Labor Relations
 Later, in discussing labor relations, Mr. Boulware said labor problems should be "thought out, not fought out." He also said compulsory union membership was "wrong in principle and bad in practice." He opposed third-party intervention in labor negotiations.
Mr. Boulware was born in Springfield, Ky., and graduated from the University of Wisconsin in 1916, where he was captain of the baseball team. After graduation he taught accounting and commercial law at the university. He also taught at the Plymouth Institute night school in Brooklyn and at Florida Atlantic University.
He served in World War I as an infantry captain, and in World War II he was operations vice chairman of the War Production Board, for which he was awarded the Presidential Medal of Merit and a Navy citation.
Before Mr. Boulware joined General Electric, he worked for five companies in a number of positions like accountant, purchasing agent, comptroller and factory and marketing manager. In 1935 he joined the Carrier Corporation as vice president and general manager. From 1940 to 1942 he was vice president and general manager of the Celotex Corporation in Chicago.
 
 Business and Professional Ties
 He joined General Electric in 1945 to head its affiliated manufacturing companies. While at G.E. he was a director of numerous companies, chairman of the Marketing Executives Society, director of the American Management Association and a member of various committees of the United States Chamber of Commerce, the National Association of Manufacturers and the Commerce and Industry Association of New York.
He was the author of two books. The first, "The Truth About Boulwarism" (1969; Bureau of National Affairs), using General Electric as an example, dealt with measures that business executives and their companies could use to gain public confidence and with steps to help workers understand business economics.
The second book, "What You Can Do About Inflation, Unemployment, Productivity, Profit and Collective Bargaining" was published in 1972.
Mr. Boulware's wife, the former Norma Brannock, died in 1987. There are no immediate survivors.

HEADLINE: Taiwan Beckons Foreign Investors, but Its Stock Market Slips

BYLINE: By SHERYL WuDUNN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TAIPEI, Taiwan

 BODY:
At one time, the stock market here seemed to have no top, soaring ever higher and trading more shares than either the New York or Tokyo markets. Foreigners longed for a chance to join in the gains.
Now, certain foreign investors will get a chance to play the Taiwan market, one of the largest in Asia. But they may no longer be as interested. The economy here has deteriorated and the stock market index has fallen 80 percent from its peak in February. Trading has been listless. 
 But with stock prices depressed, securities officials say now is an ideal time to raise the standards of the market and give it an international base by bringing in foreign institutional investors.
"We want to improve the structure of the market," said C. P. Chang, chairman of Taiwan's Securities and Exchange Commission. "We don't want to rely on foreigners to help support the market. We want them to help us change the market structure."
 
Opening Up the Market
 The Government's executive branch is about to review a proposal to allow foreign institutions like insurance and investment-management companies to invest an aggregate of $2.5 billion in securities markets here. Investing may be allowed by early next year.
Foreigners can now invest in the market only through funds listed on other exchanges, like the R.O.C. Taiwan Fund or the Taiwan Fund listed on the New York Stock Exchange.
Taiwan's stock market has always been viewed as something of a gambling den, and there is a standard joke that R.O.C. should stand not for the Republic of China but for the Republic of Casino.
The wild gyrations in the market did not keep housewives and taxi drivers from investing in stocks. In fact, investing became so profitable that some workers quit their jobs to devote full time to the market. When the market dipped after a transaction tax was placed on each trade three years ago, investors staged protests in the streets, demanding that the Government compensate them for their losses.
 
Up Sharply, Then a Plunge
 This year, investors have been sobered by a market in which the index climbed 4,000 points in three months, to a closing high of 12,424.53 on Feb. 12, and then dropped to around 5,000 in June. After the Middle East crisis, the index tumbled to a record low of 2,485.25 in trading on Oct. 12, before rising again. [It closed on Thursday at 3,554, down 135.87 for the day.]
Some people say the plunge may help the stock market in the long run by getting investors to start looking at fundamentals.
Taiwan has one of the world's most computerized stock exchanges. It was able, for example, to execute trades of 2.1 billion shares in three hours last June 1. By comparison, daily volume on the New York Stock Exchange is typically about 150 million to 200 million shares, traded in more than twice that time period.
To some extent, this computerization has contributed to the market's volatility, making it possible for the index to move far and fast. But securities officials say there were economic reasons for the climb and fall.
 
An Economic Boom
 "The fact that the market here rose to 12,000 wasn't just because we had too much gambling spirit," said Chao Hiao-feng, president of the Taiwan Stock Exchange Corporation. "Our economic situation was unusually good and our reserves high. Under these conditions, the stock market had to rise."
Officials argue that Taiwan's economic boom, its strong trade surplus and foreign reserves helped drive the market up. Because of limits on money leaving the country, much wealth has been poured into the stock market.
But dramatic changes in Taiwan have contributed to the market's volatility. The economy started deteriorating this year in part because of the slowdown in the United States, Taiwan's largest trading partner, and in part because the Government tightened the money supply. Now, officials forecast that gross national product will grow by only 5.15 percent this year, compared with 7.33 percent in 1989.
There is also an increasing sense that the country's leaders lack a firm grip on the direction of Taiwan and that growing divisions between rich and poor have driven up crime rates. Capital has also started flowing out, with more than $10 billion leaving in the first eight months of this year. As a result, the stock market has declined, the officials say.
 
'Market Really Runs Itself'
 "We have much less institutional control here, so the market really runs itself," said Tracy Cheng, senior vice president at the Taiwan Stock Exchange. "Everyone talks about perfect competition and perfect markets. In Japan and the United States, there's really much more control than in the Taiwan and Hong Kong markets. It's really a freer market here."
For the most part, foreign investors say they are eager to invest in Taiwan. "I've been here four years waiting for this market to open up," said John F. Engle, president of Hoare Govett Securities Taiwan Ltd. "Fund managers cannot just close their eyes to Taiwan and hope it disappears."
In July, the market value of shares traded on the Taiwan stock market totaled $48.08 billion, higher than in London and only slightly less than in Frankfurt, according to statistics at the exchange here. London moved slightly ahead of Taiwan in August.
 
Curbs Set Up
 Still, there will be restrictions on foreign investments. Investors will have to apply for a permit to take $5 million to $50 million into the country. After receiving approval, they will have to take the money into Taiwan within three months, presumably so that the quota could be given to another applicant if they did not comply.
After criticism by the foreign community over some of the limitations, the Securities Exchange Commission made modifications. But foreign companies will still have to leave their principal in Taiwan, in cash or securities, for three to six months before they can take it out of the country again, and profits can be remitted only once in a calendar year.
"For a country coming out of a highly regulated environment, they are trying to be as liberal as possible, but they don't want to make mistakes," said Chang Liang, president of the Shearson-Global Financial Services Company in Taiwan. "They shouldn't rush for the sake of liberalization and then get everything thrown back in their face."

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Moves Up Sharply; French Statement Is Factor

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar staged a sharp advance on world currency markets yesterday amid indications that there was some international support for a stronger United States currency.
Gold prices rose, reversing a downward trend in Europe. On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery settled at $387.30 an ounce, up $1 from Wednesday. At the Republic National Bank, the late bid was $387.15, up 45 cents. 
 The dollar got help from a disclosure by the French Economics Minister, Pierre Beregovoy, that he had written to Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady recently asking for support in seeking coordinated action to prop up the dollar.
 
Meeting Is Requested
 Mr. Beregovoy, who spoke at a news conference in Paris, said he wanted the so-called Group of Seven leading industrialized nations to meet and address the issue.
"I don't think that the United States has an interest in the sustained and accentuated decline of the dollar," he said. A stronger dollar may also take some pressure off interest rates in France and improve the competitiveness of French companies abroad.
The president of the German Bundesbank, Karl Otto Pohl, said that a meeting of the Group of Seven was not necessary. A United States Treasury spokesman said in a statement that no meeting was planned. These reports pushed the dollar temporarily lower in seesaw domestic trading.
"The market is very nervous and is looking for any kind of intervention by the central banks," said Bob Morrissey, a senior trader at the Bank of Boston's office in New York.
Concern that tensions are heightening in the Persian Gulf region also helped the dollar recover to its session highs, said John McCarthy, chief dealer at the Amsterdam Rotterdam Bank in New York. The dollar is considered a haven in times of turmoil.
The dollar's biggest advance came against the Japanese yen. In New York, the dollar jumped to close at 130.35 yen, from 128.73 yen on Wednesday. Overnight in Tokyo, the dollar had risen to a closing 129.50 Japanese yen, from 127.55 yen at Wednesday's close. Later in London, it rose to 129.90 yen.
In London, the British pound fell to $1.967 from $1.976 late Wednesday. In New York, it cost $1.9625 to buy one pound, less expensive than Wednesday's $1.9690. Against the German mark, the dollar rose to 1.4930 marks, from 1.4874.
Gold fell in London to a late bid of $385.75 an ounce, down from $387.25 late Wednesday. In Zurich, the metal fell to $384.75, from $386.75. Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold rose $2.67, to close at $386.31.

From One Who Suffered, Dire Words on China

BYLINE: By BARBARA BASLER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HONG KONG, Nov. 8

 BODY:
It was to be a private visit to Hong Kong, a rest after a grueling lecture tour of Japan. But once Nien Cheng agreed to sign copies of her book, "Life and Death in Shanghai," people here lined up by the hundreds in front of the little basement bookstore.
Many brought small gifts and anxious questions about their future under the Chinese. "People always ask me what I think will happen to Hong Kong in 1997, when the British turn it over to China," Mrs. Cheng said. "So of course I knew there would be questions here." 
 And Mrs. Cheng, a native of China, and one of the victims of its brutal Cultural Revolution, tells them candidly, "Hong Kong will be a very different place."
In an interview in her hotel room, overlooking the colony's spectacular harbor lined with gleaming skyscrapers, she said that under China, Hong Kong would no longer be a regional financial center. It will be a tense, repressed city where a black market in Hong Kong dollars flourishes, and corrupt officials hold sway through intimidation, she said.
 
An 'Inconvenient' Organization
 "They will leave the race track, because all Chinese like to gamble," she said. "And they will leave the golf courses because the top party people like the game. But they will not leave the Independent Commission Against Corruption.
"It's so inconvenient to have such an organization. People ask me if the wave of change and democracy which has swept over Eastern Europe will wash over China soon. I do not think it will, because Communism in China came from within, it was a national movement. In Eastern Europe, it was largely imposed on resisting nations with their own democratic traditions."
Moreover, she said, China's future generation of leaders, men and women now in their 30's and 40's, "are very troublesome."
"Many of these people were the Red Guards of the Cultural Revolution who left schools and training to rampage through China. I think these people will trouble China in the future because they know only how to torture and destroy."
Mrs. Cheng, a frail, elegant woman with a fierce sense of honor, endured six and a half years of solitary confinement in a Shanghai prison, from 1966 until 1973, after she was accused of being a British spy, a class enemy, during the turbulent and often terrifying days of the Cultural Revolution.
 
The Time of the Red Guards
 Born in Beijing in 1915, she was educated at an American college there and at the London School of Economics. Her husband was the general manager of Shell in Shanghai until he died of cancer in 1957, when the company hired her as an adviser.
In "Life and Death in Shanghai" (Grove-Weidenfeld), she describes daily life and then imprisonment during the time Mao's young Red Guards tried to purify China, smashing what was thought to be old, foreign and counterrevolutionary. A woman with Mrs. Cheng's background, with her Western tastes and foreign friends, was a prime target of the Cultural Revolution of 1966 to 1976.
Mrs. Cheng's account of her life and her daughter's death in Shanghai, first published six years ago, has been an international success.
She said that visitors to China have reported seeing black-market English versions of her book and around Shanghai three home-grown Chinese translations.
In fact, tourists now seek out spots Mrs. Cheng wrote about. When an American tourist asked a Chinese guide to point out the No. 1 Detention House in Shanghai, where Mrs. Cheng spent her years as political prisoner 1806, the guide said the place did not exist. "The tourist had a copy of my book, and she gave it to the guide, who took it home that night," Mrs. Cheng said. "The next morning the guide said she must not tell the others on the tour, but he would drive by the Detention Center. He said he would drive by, but say nothing."
When she was finally allowed to leave China in 1980, Mrs. Cheng left through Hong Kong. The Governor invited her to dinner, but she refused.
"I thought the Communists would say: 'We were right. Look at this woman, she must be a British spy. The moment she left China she goes to dinner with the Governor.' I didn't want to give them that satisfaction."
 
Lunch With the Governor
 On this trip, however, she agreed to have lunch with the Governor, Sir David Wilson, whom she knew when he was a diplomat in China. Asked if she would share her dark views of Hong Kong with him, she smiled and said: "I think it's embarrassing to talk about Hong Kong. We will talk about the European Community, Margaret Thatcher, old friends."
Mrs. Cheng said some business leaders she had talked to said they were optimistic about 1997. "A man said to me he hopes that if many well-educated, prosperous people stay, they might be able to influence the Communists," she said.
Then she leaned back in her chair, laughing gently and shaking her head: "You know, you can't influence the Communists. You see, that is too optimistic."
She said others in Hong Kong were too pessimistic. "They think the Communists will march into offices here with guns. But you know, they won't do that, they never did that. They take control in more subtle ways."
Mrs. Cheng, who became an American citizen recently, lives in Washington and since the success of her book has been lecturing widely.
Asked if she would ever visit China again, she shook her head: "No, I will not go back unless there are profound changes there. What would be the point?"

Message to Iraq: The Will and the Way

BYLINE: By R. W. APPLE Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 8

 BODY:
President Bush sought today to send an unmistakable message to President Saddam Hussein of Iraq that the United States had the will to go to war, that it would soon have the means to go to war and that a war, if it came, would inevitably inflict terrible damage on Iraq.
But Mr. Bush strongly hopes, his aides said, that a further show of strength will constitute such "a very strong signal, another strong signal" about the seriousness of American purpose that Mr. Hussein will pull out of Kuwait and make an offensive unnecessary. 
 It seemed no accident that the signal came in a week when Syria and Egypt both voiced their willingness to consider offensive military action against Iraq, when the Soviet Union opened the door slightly to that possibility and when Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, in a major debate in the House of Commons on Wednesday, delivered this bellicose message to President Hussein:
"Either he gets out of Kuwait soon, or we and our allies will remove him by force, and he will go down to defeat with all its consequences."
 
Praise for Thatcher
 For the first time, the President spoke not only of defending against "any further Iraqi aggression," but also of insuring that the United States and its allies had "an adequate offensive military option should that be necessary to achieve our common goals." He praised what Mrs. Thatcher had said.
But Mr. Bush did not intend to indicate that war itself was imminent, said senior Administration officials and diplomats of countries arrayed with the United States in the coalition against Iraq. They said that in the absence of the kind of flagrant provocation Mr. Hussein has so far avoided, like the killing of American hostages, the United States was unlikely to move to oust Iraqi troops from Kuwait before January or February.
Mr. Bush plans to spend Thanksgiving with United States forces in Saudi Arabia, and Presidents have usually felt it politic, where possible, to avoid military action with heavy casualties during the December holidays.
 
A New Phase
 "We have been saying for months that we would not exclude offensive action," a United States policy-maker said. "We have kept that option open. Now we are moving into a new phase, where we assemble the tools to make that option realistic. That, obviously, will take some time."
The announcement that more American forces would soon be dispatched to the Persian Gulf, including hundreds of tanks and three more aircraft carriers, was pictured by Administration officials as the essential military accompaniment to this week's mission by Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d to nations that the United States hopes would cooperate in any attack on Iraq.
But by making his move now, Mr. Bush is running the political risk that members of Congress, especially Democrats, no longer worried about jeopardizing their re-election by making comments that might seem unpatriotic, would feel freer to criticize his actions than they had before the election on Tuesday.
Shortly after the President had finished speaking, Senator Claiborne Pell, the Rhode Island Democrat who heads the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, issued a statement arguing that the United States should not "establish an offensive capacity in advance of a United Nations resolution authorizing offensive action," that "we should delay going to war until the economic embargo has been given a decent chance to produce results," and that "the President would be badly advised to go to war without a clear prior expression of Congressional support."
 
Baker Seeks Support
 "I am not yet persuaded that the expected gains from offensive action would be worth the likely high loss of American lives and greatly increased economic costs," said the Senator, a cautious politician who is unlikely to have spoken so forcefully unless convinced that many colleagues agreed with him.
But White House aides expressed confidence that most of Capitol Hill and most of the country would back the President, even though he has no intention of seeking prior permission of Congress if he decides to go to war. Important elements in this effort, one said, would be continued allied cooperation and working through the United Nations, although Mr. Bush said flatly today that the United States felt free to take offense action without United Nations authorization.
On his travels, Secretary of State Baker has been seeking support for a new United Nations resolution authorizing the use of force to carry out earlier resolutions calling on Iraq to withdraw. A European Cabinet minister, privy to Mr. Baker's discussions, said in a telephone interview that China and the Soviet Union had all but pledged they would not block such a move. Both are among the permanent members of the Security Council, with veto power.
 
A Shift by Moscow
 After a meeting in Moscow today with Mr. Baker, Eduard A. Shevardnadze, the Soviet Foreign Minister, said that "a situation may emerge which effectively would require" the use of force -- a considerable departure from an earlier statement that the use of force would be "undesirable." But Qian Qichen, China's Foreign Minister, who met Mr. Baker in Cairo, has not publicly gone nearly that far, and Beijing is reportedly urging Washington to go slow.
At his own news conference this afternoon, after that of President Bush, Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney insisted that no decision had yet been made by Mr. Bush on whether offensive action should be undertaken. The question will not have to be confronted for some weeks because the last of the tens of thousands of troops and the armor and aircaft needed for an attack will not reach the Persian Gulf until early next year, military analysts said.
Clearly the President hoped to impress Mr. Hussein anew with the depth of the American commitment against him by making public the list of military units to be deployed, something that was not done at the beginning of the initial buildup, which has now reached 230,000. It is an awesome roster, including the battleship Missouri, the First and Third Armored Divisions and the First Infantry Division -- the "Big Red One" of Omaha Beach fame.
 
'The Game Is Up'
 "I would think that when he surveys the force that's there, this force that's going, what other countries are doing in this regard, he will realize that he is up against a foe that he can't possibly manage militarily," Mr. Bush told reporters this afternoon.
Offensive units will be ready just about in time to meet the specification outlined by President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt in an interview with The New York Times on Wednesday. Warning that unless Iraq pulled back war was inevitable with "the greatest concentration of military force I have ever seen in this area," he said the anti-Baghdad coalition should wait "at least two or three more months" to see whether economic sanctions forced Mr. Hussein to act.
"The point here is to try to convince Saddam, with this announcement, that the game is up and he should let go," an Arab diplomat said. "Then you wouldn't have to use the troops. But to make the threat credible, they have to be sent, and if you need them, you need them. There's no point in attacking before the ducks are in a row."

HEADLINE: ANGOLAN LEADER GLOOMY ON TALKS

BYLINE: By KENNETH B. NOBLE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LUANDA, Angola, Nov. 7

 BODY:
President Eduardo dos Santos of Angola says that the prospects for ending his country's 15-year-old civil war soon appear bleak. He accuses Jonas Savimbi, the American-backed rebel leader, of negotiating in "bad faith" and says he doubts that a new round of peace talks, scheduled for next week, will yield anything positive.
In an interview Wednesday night, Mr. dos Santos contended that the United States was encouraging the rebel leader to continue fighting. The peace talks, the President said, were a "pretext," adding that Mr. Savimbi was still seeking a military victory. 
 "Up to now," he said of the rebel negotiators, "they haven't given any evidence that they're serious."
 
Dos Santos Blames U.S.
 Asked if this meant fighting would continue for the foreseeable future, he replied: "I'm pessimistic. I would like the war to end soon, but you have to be realistic in order to be able to lead, and the United States does not want to see this war come to an end soon. We have to get ourselves ready for that reality, because if the United States wanted peace in Angola, they would not go on giving weapons to Unita."
Since June, negotiators for the Luanda Government and the rebel group, the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola, have met four times in an effort to reach a political settlement. The fifth meeting is scheduled to be held in Portugal, Angola's former colonial ruler.
Mr. dos Santos said that Luanda had made major concessions since the negotiations began, notably the decision last month to transform its nominally Marxist-Leninist Government into one with a multiparty system. He also announced that general elections would be held at all levels, including the presidency, within three years of a peace settlement with Unita.
 
Election Issue Touchy
 Mr. dos Santos said the election timetable had become a major source of friction. The rebels, the President said, were insisting that elections be held within six months after a truce is signed, a proposal he dismissed as logistically impossible given the war-ravaged state of much of the country.
Reminded that there are some in the United States Congress, including his supporters, who have said that three years was too long to wait before elections are held, Mr. dos Santos said: "We know Angola and we know the Angolans and we want to be realistic." He added: "It's not up to the United States Congress to discuss whether elections should be held in one year, two years or three years."
Another divisive issue in the talks, Mr. dos Santos said, was whether guerrilla forces will be allowed to keep their weapons until elections are called. Unita, he said, had made this proposal a centerpiece in its bargaining position.
"Where in the world is there a political party that has been militarized?" Mr. dos Santos asked.
 
A South African Example
 "Im going to quote the example of South Africa," he continued. "One of the conditions the South African Government had demanded from the African National Congress is that they shouldn't let their armed men come into South Africa. So those who go in should go in disarmed. And no one in the world has disagreed with that position."
The 48-year-old Mr. dos Santos is a Soviet-trained engineer who has devoted his adult life to the ruling party, the Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola. His tone was informal and he seemed relaxed during the 50-minute interview, but he showed occasional flashes of frustration and anger as he discussed the peace negotations and a wide range of other subjects.
Mr. Savimbi's rebel group -- by itself or in alliance with another rebel faction that has since become inactive -- has been fighting the leftist government in Luanda virtually since Angola gained independence from Portugal in 1975. Since 1985, the Central Intelligence Agency has provided increasing military aid to the rebels, now estimated at about $60 million a year.
Mr. dos Santos succeeded to the presidency in 1979.
He said that Cuban troops in Angola, a major barrier to the establishment of diplomatic relations with the United States, have been reduced from 50,000 in January 1989 to 12,000 today, adding that all the troops would be out by July 1991.
 
Mixed Economy Pledged
 The President repeated his party's pledge to gradually move away from a centralized economy. "Our aim is to create a mixed economy," he said, emphasizing that the bulk of the retail trade and small business sector would soon be privatized.
Did that mean, Mr. dos Santos was asked, that the state-owned press and radio and television stations would be turned over to private individuals? "No, we have no intention of privatizing the main mass media stations. Normally, that doesn't happen, even in the West." He promised, though, that under a new constitution being drafted, the tightly controlled press would have greater freedom.
Mr. dos Santos avoided a direct answer when asked if he personally still considers himself a Socialist. "We've said in the past and continue to say that capitalism does not solve all of the problems of the people. We're also aware that the model of socialism that was applied in the Eastern European countries could not solve all the problems of the people either."

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
Is the Deficit Cut A Serious Error?

BYLINE: By Leonard Silk

 BODY:
AFTER failing time and again to work out a plan to eliminate the budget deficit during the years when the economy was climbing, the White House and Congress finally made a deal to cut the deficit by an estimated $40 billion in the next fiscal year and by $490 billion or so over the next five years -- just when most economists believe the economy is weak and falling into recession.
Is this, as some economists are saying, a horrendous blunder, comparable to the decision made by President Herbert Hoover to put through a huge tax rise, nearly doubling rates, as the economy was falling into the depths of the Depression in 1932?
Mr. Hoover's aim was to prevent inflation by closing the budget deficit when businesses were failing, unemployment rising and incomes falling, and the real threat was deflation. Fear of inflation, during a time of falling employment and prices, also greatly restricted the efforts of the Federal Reserve to make more money and credit available and to reduce interest rates. The perverse Hoover fiscal policy and timid Fed monetary policy, which allowed the money supply to shrink by one-third, as banks slashed their lending to business, deepened the Depression.
Are national leaders about to make the same mistakes and thrust the weakened American economy into depression? Should they just forget about reducing the structural budget deficit, regarded as a cause of big trade deficits, savings shortfalls, low capital formation and productivity growth, as well as weakened American competitiveness -- and instead focus on the short-run necessity of fighting recession by increasing the deficit through lower taxes and higher spending? C. Eugene Steuerle, who was Deputy Assistant Secretary for tax analysis at the Treasury Department before joining the Urban Institute in Washington in 1989, contends it would be a serious mistake to forget about reducing the debt burden, which has been growing faster, even in good times, than the national income, for the sake of using short-term fiscal policy to combat the recession.
Indeed, he maintains it is possible to achieve a fiscal policy that will meet both the objectives of short-term economic stabilization and long-term deficit reduction aimed at strengthening national economic growth. To get both, he calls for "automatic fiscal stabilization through the tax and transfer system" within the context of long-run fiscal balance.
To get greater fiscal responsiveness to short-run cyclical swings without sacrificing long-term economic stability, he calls for improving public insurance programs. The unemployment compensation system, traditionally the Government's chief weapon for providing anti-recessionary expenditures and insurance, has, he says become a "timebomb," because the system is so inadequately financed that a recession could make many state programs insolvent. Less than one-third of the jobless have received benefits in the last decade.
He would provide financing to unemployment compensation that would make it one of the strongest automatic stabilizers, increasing total demand when the economy slumps and decreasing it when the economy booms.
While improving the automatic stabilizers for short-term fiscal responses, he supports a long-run deficit-reduction target and would stick to it over the course of the business cycle. Negotiators of the recent budget deal, in Mr. Steuerle's view, "score fairly high marks on their overall deficit-reduction strategy, but score less well on their choice of specific cuts."
But if one relies only on the automatic stabilizers, rather than on discretionary changes in taxes or spending, to check a recession, will the economy fall into a depression?
Hyman P. Minsky, a visiting professor at Bard College of Columbia University and author of "Can 'It' Happen Again?" answers no -- because today's economy is far less vulnerable to deep depression. In 1929 the Federal Government constituted a mere 3 percent of the total United States economy; it now accounts for 25 percent, and its spending will be stable throughout the business cycle.
In addition, the Federal Reserve, in the event of crisis, would move in, as Professor Minsky says, "to flood the economy with reserves and to prevent a collapse of asset values."
After the New York stock market crash of October 1987, which swiftly spread to markets around the world, the central banks behaved as a close fraternity, and they are likely to do so in any future crisis. As the former Fed Chairman, Paul A. Volcker, put it in his 1990 Per Jacobson Lecture before the International Monetary Fund: "In a turbulent world, the importance of restoring a sense of stability is more clearly recognized."

HEADLINE: Budget Jockeying Is Fight for Survival

BYLINE: By JOSEPH BERGER

 BODY:
In tangling so publicly with the Dinkins administration over his budget, Schools Chancellor Joseph A. Fernandez is fighting not only for the jobs of teachers but for his own credibility, and perhaps survival.
 If cuts of $90 million are made in midyear and another $250 million next year, Mr. Fernandez's long-heralded plan to allow schools to manage more of their own affairs and his promise to improve instruction and safety may be rendered hollow, some educators said. Giving committees of teachers, administrators and parents the chance to eliminate jobs and programs is as savory as offering the Titanic's deckhands the chance to captain the ship, the educators said. 
 Mr. Fernandez said that if teaching jobs are lost through layoffs or attrition on the order dictated by City Hall, he will be presiding over a school system experiencing massive disruption.
Teachers who leave in midyear will be replaced, not with new teachers, but with teachers pulled out of other classrooms. Some children would have their teachers shuffled several times. School amenities -- guidance counselors, advanced courses in science, foreign language classes, sports programs would, as Mr. Fernandez sees it, all suffer.
Mr. Dinkins yesterday released a revised economic plan that called for layoffs of 117 teachers and 1,072 non-instructional employees and the elimination, through resignations and retirements, of another 742 teaching positions and 328 other jobs. But Mr. Fernandez, who last week warned of as many as 4,400 layoffs, quickly replied that the attrition figures are unrealistic and that Mr. Dinkins's cuts would necessitate far more layoffs.
 
A Weakened Image?
 It is virtually impossible to figure out who is right about the impact of the budget cuts because everyone with detailed knowledge is aligned with one camp or the other.
City Hall officials believe Mr. Fernandez is engaging in doomsday talk about inordinate numbers of layoffs in order to generate public and political opposition to the cuts, with City Council hearings still ahead and with larger cuts of $243 million looming in the next fiscal year that starts July 1.
For Mr. Fernandez what is at stake is more than numbers, however. It is the reputation he brought from Miami last year as a man who saves troubled urban school systems.
Losing the budget battle would weaken Mr. Fernandez's once-invincible image in the public eye and, more important, in Albany.
The man who earlier this year got the State Legislature to dilute tenure for principals and abolish the Board of Examiners, the school system's licensing arm, would find it hard to win the third of his major initiatives -- a stronger role in the selection of district superintendents.
"Victories form the foundation for other victories," said Jerald Posman, a former deputy chancellor for finance. "A lot of what Fernandez was able to achieve was because there was an aura around him that he could make things happen, and if you suffer a major defeat like this, then the whole program you're putting forward is in jeopardy."
On a more brass-tacks level, Mr. Fernandez and his aides are being diverted from running the schools and worn down by the sheer time they have had to spend trimming the budget and meeting with Board of Education members and City Hall officials.
 
Doomsday Talk
 A good illustration of their distraction came on Wednesday when a task force on safety and discipline led by Laura Blackburne, head of the city's Housing Authority, issued a report that Mr. Fernandez's own aides found bland and did little to publicize.
Mayor David N. Dinkins and his aides said they are only trying to get Mr. Fernandez to make reductions needed if the city hopes to sell its bonds. They said the Board of Education has long been a refuge of waste.
Mr. Fernandez has his own explanation for Mr. Dinkins's motives. He has told associates that his agency is virtually being singled out for layoffs because City Hall has a hidden agenda: to pressure Sandra Feldman, president of the United Federation of Teachers, to abrogate the 5.5 percent wage increase she recently negotiated.
"They agreed to it," said one aide to the Chancellor of City Hall's role in the wage package. "Now their plan is to run away from the contract as far as they can go. They say we will stick them with $90 million in cuts and force Feldman to crawl up the steps of City Hall, saying, 'Don't lay off teachers. We'll take back 2 percent.' "
 
Bad Teacher-Student Ratio
 Is Mr. Fernandez being disingenuous and engaging in political gamesmanship when he cries about the impact of the cuts?
Robert F. Wagner Jr., former president of the Board of Education and the man who appointed Mr. Fernandez, said that New York City already spends less per child than most other localities -- $4,787 compared with a statewide average of $5,207. Noreen Connell, executive director of the Educational Priorities Panel, a coalition of advocacy groups, said New York schools have one teacher for every 15.7 pupils, the second worst ratio in the state.
By comparison, Westchester County has one teacher for every 12 students. The board's notoriously heavy headquarters staff has actually been cut from 7,700 in 1986 to 3,500 today, Mr. Wagner said.
Part of the division with City Hall also has its roots in personalities. There are reports of strains between Deputy Mayor Norman Steisel and Stanley S. Litow, deputy chancellor for operations. And Gwendolyn C. Baker, the current board president, although appointed by Mr. Dinkins, simply does not have the policy influence on him that Mr. Wagner had with Mayor Edward I. Koch, his close friend.
Ms. Connell thinks the donnybrook with City Hall may only be another sign that Mr. Fernandez is suffering a backlash among political officials to his efforts to limit the power of local school boards. She noted that Mr. Fernandez also did not do so well with legislators in Albany in June when he sought restorations to his state allocation.
"The people who are in the political world, in the clubhouse world, are going to get their nose out of joint when he shows up at budget time," she said.

HEADLINE: Consumers Slow Their Borrowing

BYLINE: REUTERS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 8

 BODY:
American consumers took out $3 billion more in credit during September than they repaid, using some of it to buy new cars but trimming the rate of credit growth from the summer months, the Federal Reserve Board reported today.
"We're seeing a steady decrease in consumer credit, which is logical considering the circumstances that people are facing, including fears about losing their jobs," said Jean Sundrla, an economist with Evans Economics Inc. in Washington. 
 Installment credit expanded by $3.06 billion in August and by $4.73 billion in July.
Loans to buy new cars increased in September by $163 million after contracting by $1.51 billion in August and by $377 million in July, as people repaid more loans than they took out during the summer.
 
Incentives to Clear Lots
 But September marked the end of the 1990 model year, and dealers used a variety of incentives to clear their lots.
Prices have risen on many 1991 models. Although sales picked up in October, analysts attributed the gains primarily to rental car companies renewing their fleets and not to individual buying.
Ms. Sundrla said that there was likely to be an additional adverse impact from rising energy prices as the year went on, not only on car sales but also on general consumer confidence.
"Now is the time for people to be paying off their credit card balances rather than increasing them," she said, noting that if an expected consumer pullback occurred, it would probably deepen a recession that many expect to begin in the current fourth quarter and to continue into 1991.
Revolving, or credit card, credit grew in September by $1.91 billion, but that was much smaller than the increases in August and July of $2.35 billion and $3.78 billion respectively.
 
Bank Loans Slow
 Growth in other credit, a category that takes in bank loans but not home mortgages, slowed to a $1.15 billion rise from $2.03 billion in August.
Loans for mobile homes declined in September by $219 million after expanding during August by $180 million.
Before seasonal adjustment, the total of all consumer debts outstanding that are to be paid on the installment plan was $737.43 billion at the end of September, up from $734.51 billion at the end of August.

Excerpts From Bush's Remarks on His Order to Enlarge U.S. Gulf Force

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 8

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from President Bush's news conference at the White House today, as provided by the Federal News Service, a transcription company.
 OPENING STATEMENT
 On Aug. 6, in response to the unprovoked Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, I ordered the deployment of U.S. military forces to Saudi Arabia and the Persian Gulf to deter further Iraqi aggression and to protect our interests in the region. What we've done is right, and I'm happy to say that most members of Congress and the majority of Americans agree.
From the very beginning, we and our coalition partners have shared common political goals -- the immediate, complete and unconditional withdrawal of Iraqi forces from Kuwait, restoration of Kuwait's legitimate government, protection of the lives of citizens held hostage by Iraq, both in Kuwait and Iraq, and restoration of security and stability in the Persian Gulf region. To achieve these goals, we and our allies have forged a strong diplomatic, economic and military strategy to force Iraq to comply with these objectives. The framework of this strategy is laid out in 10 United Nations resolutions overwhelmingly supported by the United Nations Security Council.
In three months, the U.S. troop contribution to the multinational force in Saudi Arabia has gone from 10,000 to 230,000, as part of Operation Desert Shield. General Schwarzkopf reports that our forces in conjunction with other coalition forces now have the capability to defend successfully against any further Iraqi aggression.
 
Allied Consultations
 After consultation with King Fahd and our other allies, I have today directed the Secretary of Defense to increase the size of U.S. forces committed to Desert Shield to insure that the coalition has an adequate offensive military option should that be necessary to achieve our common goals. Toward this end, we will continue to discuss the possibility of both additional allied force contributions and appropriate United Nation actions. Iraq's brutality, aggression and violations of international law cannot be allowed to succeed.
Secretary Baker has been consulting with our key partners in the coalition. He has met with the Emirs of Bahrain and Kuwait, King Fahd, President Mubarak, as well as the Chinese Foreign Minister, President Ozal, Foreign Minister Shevardnadze, President Gorbachev. He also will be meeting with Prime Minister Thatcher and President Mitterrand. I have been heartened by Jim's appraisal of the strong international solidarity and determination to insure that Iraq's aggression does not stand and is not rewarded.
But right now Kuwait is struggling for survival. And along with many other nations, we've been called upon to help. The consequences of our not doing so would be incalculable, because Iraq's aggression is not just a challenge to the security of Kuwait and other gulf nations, but to the better world that we all have hoped to build in the wake of the cold war. And therefore, we and our allies cannot and will not shirk our responsibilities. The state of Kuwait must be restored, or no nation will be safe, and the promising future we anticipate will indeed be jeopardized.
Let me conclude with a word to the young American G.I.'s deployed in the gulf. We are proud of each and every one of you. I know you miss your loved ones and want to know when you'll be coming home. We won't leave you there any longer than necessary. I want every single soldier out of there as soon as possible. And we are all grateful for your continued sacrifice and your commitment. . . .
 
QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS
 Q. Mr. President, it sounds like you're going to war. You have moved from a defensive position to an offensive position and you have not said how many more troops you are sending or really why.
A. Well, I said why right now, and I hope that it's been very clear to the American people.
Q. Well is there -- are there new reasons that have moved this posture?
A. No, I'm just continuing to do what we feel is necessary to complete our objectives, to fulfill our objectives that have been clearly stated.
Q. Well, are you going to war?
A. I'm not -- we -- I would love to see a peaceful resolution to this question. And that's what I want.
 
Reason for Shift
 Q. What made you change from defense to offense?
A. I would like to see a peaceful solution to this question. I think Saddam Hussein should fully, without condition, comply to the U.N. resolutions. And if this movement of force is what convinces him, so much the better.
 
Embargo Time Limit
 Q. Mr. President, you said that -- you said last week that the sanctions haven't had the impact that you wanted. Some -- some members of the coalition are urging a go-slow approach. The President of Egypt says you've got to wait two or three months before you judge whether the sanctions have worked. Are you willing to wait that long?
A. Wait for what?
Q. To see if the sanctions have worked?
A. Well, we're -- well, I think from talking to Jim Baker and recently to President Mubarak that we are in total sync with him. But I hope that the sanctions will work within a two-month period. But I don't think we've got a difference with Egypt on this at all, Terry.
Q. The question is, how long are you willing to give ----
A. Well, I can't tell you how long. I'm not going to -- if I -- if I knew, I certainly wouldn't want to signal that to -- to Saddam Hussein.
 
Power to Attack
 Q. Do you feel that you are free to take offensive action without any kind of U.N. resolution authorizing it?
A. Yes. We have the authority, but we've -- we've been great believers in going to the United Nations. And I think one of the major successes has been the ability to have world opinion totally on our side because of U.N. action. The peacekeeping function of the United Nations has indeed been rejuvenated by the actions of the Security Council. . . .
Q. Do you yet have the support you need in order to secure an additional resolution from the U.N. Security Council to explicitly authorize the use of force? Do you now have the sufficient support on the Security Council ----
A. . . . I'd say we have not tried to specifically poll the 15 members -- or the other 14 members of the Security Council along those lines, so I can't answer whether we would or not.
 
Force's Transformation
 Q. Mr. President, what has happened in the last two weeks that has led you to put now an offensive force into Saudi Arabia?
A. Well, we have -- we have not only offensive but defensive forces there already. And what leads me to do this is just because I believe -- upon the advice of our able Secretary of Defense and others -- that this is in the best security interests of our people that are there and of the coalition.
 
Gorbachev's View
 Q. Sir, on your consultation that your Secretary of State is doing now in Moscow, could you just spell out for us what your understanding is, as of today, with Mikhail Gorbachev, on the use of force?
A. . . . I am convinced from what the Secretary has told me that we are on the same wavelength in terms of the objectives that I've spelled out here. But I can't go in -- with you into what the Soviet position will be on use of force or -- you know, I don't think they've been asked to send forces. Is that -- maybe I missed the question.
 
Shevardnadze Comment
 Q. [inaudible] Mr. Shevardnadze on the record today said that they too would not rule out the use of force, while they still wanted a peaceful solution. Does that at least help you send the kind of signal to Saddam Hussein that you're also trying to send here?
A. I think it's -- I think it is very helpful, but I think the signal of solidarity between the United States and the Soviet Union and the rest of the Security Council has already gone out. But no, I do -- I think that it is very helpful to have a position like that stated and restated, because that's the way the whole world feels, and it is good to have this solid front between ourselves and the Soviet Union.
 
War and Israel
 Q. . . . There have been complaints, observations, out of Israel that, were there to be offensive action, there needs to be coordination or some sort of chain of command involving the Israelis too, for they may end up being involved. To what extent are you communicating with the Israelis? And to what extent do you envision any role or possible role for the Israelis should this come to war?
A. Well, I think the whole world knows that the United States is -- has a very special relationship with Israel -- a strong relationship. I think we're in close touch with the key players there in terms of our objectives. And I think they've conducted themselves in a -- regarding all of this -- very well indeed. But I'm not going to discuss any more details than that. But I -- I feel that we're on a good wavelength there.
Q. Mr. President ----
A. We have some differences obviously. . . .
 
Gauging Hussein
 Q. Some of members of your Administration are convinced that Saddam Hussein will not move until he is -- until the 11th hour or 11:59, when he is totally convinced that you are about to use military force. Why is he not convinced now, do you think? Why -- how do you expect that you will be able to get to that 11:59 in a minute?
A. Well, I'm not sure I accept the 11:59 analogy, but if there has ever been any doubt in his mind about the seriousness of the West and of the other Arab countries and of the coalition -- put it that way -- I think that those doubts are rapidly being dispelled.
And I would think that when he surveys the force that's there, this force that's going, what other countries are doing in this regard, he will recognize that he is up against a -- just an -- a foe that he can't possibly manage militarily.

HEADLINE: Disney Profits Increase 9%

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: BURBANK, Calif., Nov. 8

 BODY:
The weakening economy slowed profit growth at Walt Disney Company to 9 percent in the quarter that ended on Sept. 30, the entertainment giant said today.
Michael Eisner, the chief executive, and Frank Wells, the president, said in a joint statement that theme park attendance had dropped off during the summer months. Operating income from the parks rose just 1 percent for the quarter, Disney said.
Recession fears and other concerns have caused investors to knock Disney's stock price down from a high of $136.50 a share in the last year to the $90 range in recent weeks. On the New York Stock Exchange today, the stock gained 12.5 cents, to $91.125.
During the fourth fiscal quarter, Disney earned $232.7 million, or $1.72 a share, compared with $212.7 million, or $1.54 a share, in the period in 1989. Revenue rose 27 percent, to $1.71 billion from $1.35 billion.

HEADLINE: Laventhol Paying the Price For Accounting Ambitions

BYLINE: By ALISON LEIGH COWAN

 BODY:
Laventhol & Howarth, the nation's seventh-largest accounting firm, tried to take on the giants of accounting, landing such diverse clients as Jim Bakker's P.T.L. and the film maker Woody Allen.
Now, with the accounting industry in a downturn, the Philadelphia-based firm is paying the price for its ambitions. 
 A number of costly lawsuits, including a multimillion dollar suit involving the P.T.L., is eating into profits. Partners and employees are leaving at a rapid clip. And senior executives have appealed to employees and retired partners for ways to conserve cash.
In the few months since Robert N. Levine took over as the firm's chief executive, its partnership ranks have tumbled 15 percent, to 362. Some of these departures where part of Mr. Levine's austerity program, but a great many are ranking partners.
For his part, Mr. Levine said that talk of bankruptcy or dissolving the firm was premature. "We just have no intention of dissolving the firm at this time," he said. "Whatever you've heard is just part of a planning process that any good management would do looking to deal with an economy that is difficult. I can tell you categorically we have not prepared any papers."
Among the significant departures are Kenneth I. Solomon, Philip T. Winik and David Love, heads of the Chicago, Los Angeles and Boston offices, respectively. Former partners of the firm, who asked not to be identified, said these three offices alone contributed well over a third of Laventhol's profits in recent years.
Nor is the exodus slowing. Competitors report getting a large number of resumes from Laventhol partners. And other firms, convinced that Laventhol cannot enforce the promise that its partners make not to compete with the firm for two to four years, are raiding the firm's talent.
According to former Laventhol partners, Bjorn Hanson, one of the firm's leaders in its hospitality and lodging practice, is joining Coopers & Lybrand. One small Chicago firm seeking to increase its national profile, Altschuler, Melvoin & Glasser, has snared three of Laventhol's partners -- Sandy Morriss, Richard Goodman and Kenneth S. Pinsky -- in the last few weeks.
 
Smaller Clients Leave
 In recent months, a string of smaller audit clients including the Twistee Treat Corporation, American Screen Company, Southern Kitchens Inc. and Micros Systems Inc. have abandoned the firm. And Mr. Levine has acknowledged that the firm's troubles have cost it consulting business.
Though Laventhol's senior management has been insisting for months that the firm's problems were behind it, the strains of the last few months have clearly caught up with Mr. Levine.
Two weeks ago, the firm slashed the pay of its 3,500 employees by 10 percent for the next three months. Last week, in another step to conserve cash, Mr. Levine sought to defer until early next year the monthly payments to the firm's 115 or so retirees. The firm's national council, composed of 16 partners, met last week and rejected that suggestion. The checks went out on Friday.
"We have paid the full amount due our retired partners and we will pay everything due to them at the end of our distribution year at May 15, 1991," Mr. Levine said.
Laventhol is hardly the only accounting firm to be practicing austerity these days. But Laventhol entered this period of contraction weaker than many of its competitors.
 
Paid Out Over $50 Million
 The firm has agreed to pay more than $50 million in the last three years to settle various lawsuits accusing it of shoddy work. Though nearly every accounting firm is sued by disgruntled investors, Laventhol had more than its share of such lawsuits -- the price, some say, of an overly ambitious expansion plan that caused it not to be choosy enough about its clientele.
The firm audited the books of the Grabill Corporation, a Chicago real estate company run by William J. Stoecker. Laventhol reached a $30 million settlement last year with nine creditor banks who were defrauded when Grabill's assets turned out to be vastly overstated in what Mr. Levine called "the darkest day in the firm's history"
"I don't think anyone would deny the litigation has been a strain on the firm," said David Love, the former head of the Boston office who has been working as an independent consultant since taking early retirement at the end of June.
Besides the retirees, interested parties are monitoring the situation closely. According to former partners and people in banking, the firm has at least $80 million in loans outstanding to a consortium of banks that includes the Chase Manhattan Bank, where it has been classified as a problem account, and the Fidelity Bank of Philadelphia, which is owed more than $50 million.
The firm also has 5 to 15 years left on many of its office leases, which the partners would have to make good on if the firm ceased practicing.
 
Soft Real Estate Market
 "It's a mind-boggling kind of thing," said a former Laventhol partner who insisted on anonymity. "You've got enormous obligations there that really can only be serviced by continuing to practice, unless landlords agree to take back property, which in this soft real estate market is hard to do."
Just about the only group that would be well covered in the event of a financial disaster appears to be the investors who had sued Laventhol for its role in a group of Houston oil-drilling tax shelters that soured. The plaintiffs settled the case late last year for $13.5 million on condition that Laventhol pay $8 million up front and obtain a letter of credit from Chase guaranteeing the balance, in the event that the firm ran into subsequent financial problems.
"We hope that does not occur, but if it does, we did not want to be in a position of being a creditor with a big claim," said Richard Drubel, the Houston attorney who represented the plaintiffs in the class-action lawsuit.

HEADLINE: Retail Sales Were Slow Last Month

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The nation's largest retail chains reported dismal sales results for October yesterday, dimming an already gloomy outlook for the Christmas shopping season.
Several companies, including Sears, Roebuck and J. C. Penney, said their sales dropped from levels of a year earlier as consumers, with an eye on the economy and the other on the Middle East, avoided buying anything they did not need. Wal-Mart, though, continued to go against the trend, posting strong gains.
 
No Buying Binges
 With Christmas less than seven weeks away, neither the retailers nor the analysts who follow them expect consumers to shift gears suddenly and go on big gift-buying sprees.
The holiday season will be "a much more frugal Christmas," predicted Thomas Tashjian of Seidler Amdec Securities Inc. in Los Angeles.
"They'll probaby be going in and buying the same number of items, but they're not going to pay as much," he said. "They're not going to buy $100 electronic toys for their kids."
The poor October sales, coming in the aftermath of disappointing showings in August and September, "reflect a recessionary psychology" among consumers, said Jeffrey Feiner, an analyst with Merrill Lynch.
Consumers cut spending as the economy weakened and after the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait on Aug. 2 raised the specter of war, inflating prices of gasoline and heating oil.
The first items crossed off shopping lists were discretionary items -- furniture, some clothing and other extras that are the bread and butter of many large stores.
 
The Economic Effects
 If retailers have a tough Christmas, it could contribute to a further deterioration of the economy, since two-thirds of the nation's economic growth is generated through consumer spending.
Unsold goods on store shelves could also affect manufacturing, since if stores do not place new orders, factories will not need to provide as many products, possibly laying off workers.
A poor Christmas season could also be devastating for retailers, which depend on holiday shopping for about half their annual sales and profits. Last Christmas was a disappointment for many stores after they were forced to slash prices to attract customers.
Sears, Roebuck & Company, the nation's largest retailer, said its results from stores open at least a year, called same-store or comparable-store sales, fell by four-tenths of a percent last month from October 1989. The overall sales of the Chicago-based retailer dropped by 1.2 percent.
Analysts say comparable-store sales provide a more accurate assessment of a retailer's performance than overall sales. New stores tend to have extraordinarily strong sales that can skew a retailer's results.
One of the hardest hit last month was the J. C. Penney Company, which said its comparable-store sales fell by 6.3 percent from October of last year, while its overall sales dropped by 4.9 percent.
 
Limited's Mixed Results
 The Limited Inc., the nation's largest specialty-apparel retailer, reported that its comparable-store sales dropped by 1 percent as overall sales rose by 13 percent. Apparel stores were also affected by continuing warm weather in some parts of the country.
The May Department Stores Company -- the parent of such large department-store chains as Lord & Taylor, Hecht's, Filene's and Foley's -- said its comparable-store sales dropped by 4.4 percent, while its overall sales edged up by 1.1 percent.
But Wal-Mart Stores Inc., the big discount retailer, continued to outperform the rest of the retail industry, reporting that its comparable-store sales rose by 10 percent and that its overall sales rose by 25 percent.
Analysts are predicting trouble for some stores, especially those going into the Christmas season with high inventories and unexpectedly poor sales. These retailers are expected to be the first ones to mark down merchandise -- and see their profits evaporate.
 
Waiting for More Sales
 Markdowns set off a spiral of sorts as consumers, having seen one round of price reductions, wait for more merchandise to be reduced and end up forcing retailers to take further cuts. When one retailer lowers prices, it puts pressure on others to follow.
Mr. Feiner, the Merrill Lynch analyst, noting that profits during Christmas 1989 were hurt by markdowns, issued a warning about another disappointing season: "The end result could be further bankruptcies and-or consolidations in the industry."
Following are the overall domestic sales for October and sales for the first nine months of the year reported yesterday by some of the nation's largest retailers. Reporting periods vary slightly and not all retailers have the same fiscal year.
 
 Sears: Down 1.2 percent in four weeks ended Nov. 3, to $2.55 billion, comparing continuing lines only; up 2.5 percent in nine months, to $24.38 billion.
K Mart Corp.: Up 11.2 percent in four weeks ended Oct. 31, to $2.34 billion; up 11.8 percent in nine months, to $22.32 billion.
Wal-Mart: Up 25 percent in October, to $2.73 billion; up 26 percent in nine months, to $22.24 billion.
J. C. Penney: Down 4.9 percent in four weeks ended Nov. 3, to $1.31 billion; up 1.8 percent in nine months, to $10.31 billion.
Dayton Hudson Corp.: Up 16.7 percent in four weeks ended Nov. 3, to $1.13 billion; up 13.8 percent in nine months, to $9.70 billion.
May Department Stores: Up 1.1 percent in four weeks ended Nov. 3, to $708.6 million; up 8.2 percent in nine months, to $6.75 billion.
Melville Corp.: Up 21.9 percent in four weeks ended Nov. 3, to $690 million; up 12.7 percent in first 10 months, to $6.45 billion.
Woolworth Corp.: Up 4.2 percent in four weeks ended Nov. 3, to $375 million; up 7.7 percent in nine months, to $3.86 billion.
Limited: Up 13 percent in four weeks ended Nov. 3, to $380 million; up 17 percent in nine months, to $3.51 billion, excluding results of the Lerner Woman division that has been sold.
Carter Hawley Hale Stores Inc.: Up 1.7 percent in four weeks ended Nov. 3, to $212 million; up six-tenths of a percent in nine months, to $1.88 billion.
TJX Cos.: Up 13.8 percent in four weeks ended Nov. 3, to $195.8 million; up 13.2 percent in nine months, to $1.75 billion.

BUSH SENDS NEW UNITS TO GULF TO PROVIDE 'OFFENSIVE OPTION'; U.S. FORCE COULD REACH 380,000

BYLINE: By MICHAEL R. GORDON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 8

 BODY:
President Bush today ordered more than 150,000 additional American ground, sea and air forces to the Persian Gulf area, saying they were needed to provide "an adequate offensive military option" to drive Iraqi troops from Kuwait.
The move would nearly double the size of the American land and naval combat units in the area and give the United States a numerical advantage over Iraq in the most up-to-date tanks. 
 In making his announcement, Mr. Bush said the reinforcements were intended to increase pressure on President Saddam Hussein of Iraq to withdraw his troops from Kuwait, and to lay the foundation for an American attack should he continue to refuse.
 
The Military Option
 "I have today directed the Secretary of Defense to increase the size of U.S. forces committed to Desert Shield to insure that the coalition has an adequate offensive military option, should that be necessary to achieve our common goals," Mr. Bush said at a White House news conference. [Excerpts, page A12.]
"I think Saddam Hussein should fully without condition comply to the U.N. resolutions. And if this movement of force is what convinces him, so much the better," he said.
Before President Bush spoke, Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze of the Soviet Union delivered Moscow's most explicit warning yet to Iraq, saying today in Moscow that the use of force to end the Persian Gulf crisis ould not be ruled out if diplomatic means fail. [Page A13.]
 
380,000 by Early Next Year
 The Pentagon declined to say exactly how many additional troops were being sent, but one Administration official estimated that the additional reinforcements would number more than 150,000. That would bring the total American force in the gulf region to about 380,000 by early next year.
Mr. Bush said he did not need United Nations approval to launch a military action against Iraq, but he indicated the Administration would seek out that support.
"Yes, we have the authority but we've been great believers in going to the United Nations," Mr. Bush said in a question-and-answer session after his announcement. Virtually all of Washington's partners in the anti-Iraqi coalition have said that any military action should be undertaken under the umbrella of a Security Council resolution.
The Security Council has adopted 10 resolutions against Iraq since Mr. Hussein's forces invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2. One of the earliest measures, now three months old, provided for a comprehensive trade embargo and the blocking of all Iraqi assets abroad.
Mr. Bush refused to say when force might be used, but he indicated agreement with President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt, who said on Wednesday in an interview that two to three months more should be given to allow the sanctions against Iraq to work. If the sanctions fail, Mr. Mubarak said, war would be inevitable.
The new reinforcements mark the largest military deployment since the Vietnam War, in which American troops stationed in Vietnam reached a peak of 543,000, excluding naval forces offshore. The deployment is also large by NATO standards, roughly equivalent in number to the American forces stationed in Western Europe during the cold war.
 
3 Aircraft Carriers
 The additional forces -- which include three and one-third Army divisions, three aircraft carriers, another battleship, a large Marine expeditionary force of more than 30,000 men and more Air Force units -- would join more than 230,000 American soldiers, Marines, sailors and airmen in the region.
Although Administration officials previously outlined plans to send additional forces to the gulf area, saying two weeks ago that as many as 100,000 more troops might be sent, the decision today involves more troops and more armored units than expected. It is also the first time that Mr. Bush has explicitly threatened to to take offensive action against Iraq.
The decision appears to have the dual purpose of escalating the pressure on Mr. Hussein to withdraw from Kuwait and increasing military forces in the region to a level at which an attack against Iraqi troops would be more feasible.
 
1,200 More M-1 Tanks
 The Army divisions being sent will add more than 1,200 modern M-1 tanks to about 800 American tanks already deployed in Saudi Arabia. The new tank deployments would give the United States an advantage in the number of top-of-the-line battle tanks, although Iraq, which has thousands of old tanks, would still have an overall advantage in tanks.
The three aircraft carriers that are being sent will bring the total number of carriers in the region to six. The Navy has a total of 14 aircraft carriers.
Mr. Bush has also ordered that an additional battleship, the Missouri, join the Wisconsin in the Persian Gulf. With their 16-inch guns and land-attack cruise missiles, the battleships will figure significantly in the impressive American firepower in the region.
"There will probably be additional Air Force units also," said Mr. Cheney, adding that the precise units to be sent have not been determined. The United States has already stationed about 500 Air Force and Marine bombers, antitank aircraft and fighters in Saudi Arabia and other gulf nations, including a squadron of F-117 Stealth fighters, several dozen F-111F bombers in Saudi Arabia and about 20 B-52 bombers on the Indian Ocean island of Diego Garcia.
 
Rivaling Cold War Numbers
 With the dispatch of the additional divisions, the United States will have about as many troops in the Persian Gulf as it maintained in Europe for about 40 years to oppose the Soviet military. Even with the warming in American and Soviet relations the United States kept some 305,000 Army and Air Force troops in Europe.
General Colin L. Powell, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said at the news conference that two and a third of the Army's four and a third divisions in Western Europe were being sent to Saudi Arabia.
The decision to send large reinforcements to the region suggests that the Bush Administration wants to leave a credible threat that it will force a resolution of the crisis, either by coercing President Hussein to withdraw his troops from Kuwait or by launching an attack with its allies to do so.
President Bush asserted that the United States is receiving strong support from Western European, Arab and other members of the anti-Iraqi coaltion. Iraq has sought to divide the coalition, by releasing French and German hostages, for example, and some specialists question how long the alliance can hold.
 
Waiting for Cool Weather
 Some military specialists say that if President Bush wants to use military force it would be preferable to begin in the cooler winter months, before the Muslim holy visits to Mecca in the spring. Defense Secretary Dick Cheney declined to say what role weather or political considerations played in the decision to send large reinforcements now instead of waiting to see if the economic sanctions work.
 
No Upper Limit Yet
 Mr. Cheney declined to rule out sending still more troops, saying that no upper limit had been set on American deployment in the gulf. He said Congressional leaders had been notified of the additional reinforcements today before the announcement. Congress has insisted that it be consulted before force is used in the gulf, but the Administration did not seek to explain the scope of its planned reinforcement before lawmakers adjourned late last month.
While military officials say that a buildup would be needed to win a decisive victory and to limit American casualties in the event of war, some specialists said the new deployment would increase the risk of war.
"It is too big a force to sit on," said Thomas McNaugher, a military specialist at the Brookings Institution, suggesting that the United States would be unlikely to tie down such a force for a lengthy period.
The Administration's decision to continue the American buildup follows Iraq's move to expand its force in southern Iraq and Kuwait to some 430,000 and build elaborate fortications along the coast of Kuwait and the Saudi border.
In addition to more than 230,000 American forces deployed in the region, allies of the United States have stationed well over 100,000 troops in the area, and more forces, including an Egyptian armored division and a Syrian armored division are being sent.
The deployment of the three and a third Army divisions -- two and a third divisions from Germany and one from Fort Riley, Kansas -- is a major addition to United States armored capabilities in Saudi Arabia. Army figures show that the new units collectively have about 1,240 M-1 tanks, 750 of them new M1-A1 tanks, which have better guns and protection against chemical and biological attack.
The American expeditionary force currently has about 800 tanks. This includes about 700 Army M-1 tanks, some 150 of which are M1-A1 models, and 120 Marine M-60 tanks.
Mr. Cheney said the decision to add more forces was based in part on the assessment by the commander of American forces in the gulf region, Gen. H. Norman Schwarzkopf, of what would be needed to launch an offensive against Iraqi troops.
"The additional military capability that's now being added clearly will give us the ability to conduct offensive military operations, should that be required in the months ahead," Mr. Cheney said. He said it would be early next year before all of the forces activated today were sent to the Persian Gulf and were combat-ready.
The Pentagon is considering a plan to rotate fresh troops into the gulf region every six to eight months, but Mr. Cheney said a final decision had not yet been made on the policy. The 82d Airborne, which was deployed early in the conflict to get troops on the ground in a hurry, is expected to return to the United States so that the Army will have a quick reaction force for other possible crises and so the unit can continue its training. No announcement was made about the future of the 82d Airborne today.
In addition to adding more active-duty forces, Mr. Cheney also called up the first Army combat reserve units, about 15,000 men. The Marine Corps has mobilized about 700 reservists this week for combat roles. Three Army National Guard brigades from Georgia, Mississippi and Louisiana were called up and will be sent to train for several weeks at the Army Training Center in Fort Irwin, Calif.
Once the units have completed their training, Mr. Cheney said, the Pentagon will decide if they are ready enough to be sent to join front-line troops in Saudi Arabia.

HEADLINE: DINKINS ANNOUNCES JOB CUTS TO EASE BUDGET TROUBLES

BYLINE: By TODD S. PURDUM

 BODY:
Facing New York City's deepening fiscal problems, Mayor David N. Dinkins said yesterday that he would not hire workers to fill about 5,000 planned city jobs, would lay off at least 556 workers in schools, parks and hospital headquarters and make other cuts to keep the city budget balanced.
But the Mayor's announcement amounted to what he called "a downpayment" on the problems. He acknowledged that far more painful cuts were likely to be needed -- including perhaps 10,000 layoffs, as well as 10,000 jobs to be cut through attrition -- to help close an expected gap between revenues and expenditures of more than $1.6 billion for the next fiscal year that starts July 1. 
 The actions Mr. Dinkins outlined yesterday included scaling back school programs, delaying garbage recycling and closing two fire companies. They are intended to close a budget gap that he now estimates at $388 million for the current fiscal year, or a problem just one-fourth the projected size of next year's.
 
Cautious Support
 Fiscal monitors who had awaited the plan as a sign of Mr. Dinkins's resolve, in the wake of conflicting fiscal signals from City Hall a month ago, generally reacted with cautious support. The Mayor is to present his detailed plan for the next fiscal year in January.
"The major fiscal problem has always been fiscal 1992," said Allen J. Proctor, executive director of the State Financial Control Board, a watchdog agency. "One of the primary objectives of this modification was to deal with an important but not so fiscally focused problem, which is: does the Mayor have a comprehensive view of the problems he must deal with? This shows that the Mayor has indeed a firm grasp of the problems he must deal with, and he has articulated a sequence of events to provide solutions."
The latest moves, including the service cuts and efforts to maxmimize state and Federal matching funds for social programs, are expected to translate into savings that will help reduce the budget gap for next year by more than $300 million. Some of the actions taken now, especially those that do not involve trimming the work force, will not produce increased savings next year.
Mr. Dinkins also outlined a series of other tentative measures for next year, including stepped-up audits, reductions in debt service on city bonds, a proposal that the state assume $165 million in Medicaid costs, and $100 million in unspecified Federal action. Those move are intended to close $700 million more of the $1.6 billion gap, leaving only about $600 million still to be dealt with.
 
Elements 'Look Good'
 In a move that drew praise, Mr. Dinkins said he would increase the city's general reserve fund for unanticipated expenses to $150 million, from $100 million, using part of the one-time proceeds from the sale of a plot of vacant city land to the Federal Government for a new office building in lower Manhattan.
Hyman Grossman, a managing director of the Standard & Poor's Corporation, which last month put the city's bonds on a "credit watch" because of concerns about its economy and fiscal planning, said that he had not yet reviewed the plan in detail but that several elements "look good." He said those included increasing the reserve and the Mayor's outlining of $40 million in additional service cuts he would order if the situation worsened this year.
 
'I'm Not a Patsy'
 For now, the Mayor struggled to avoid deep cuts in direct services, though many of those services have been cut repeatedly in recent years. And Schools Chancellor Joseph A. Fernandez contends that Mr. Dinkins's demands for cuts in the Board of Education would lead to thousands of layoffs in the school system, not the few hundred that mayoral aides suggest.
Mr. Dinkins, who has dedicated his administration to children, acknowledged that the school cuts would be painful, but he said they had to be made one way or the other, and despite weeks of sparring, said he assumed that Mr. Fernandez did not question his determination. "I'm sure they recognize that I'm not a patsy," he said.
In other ways, Mr. Dinkins minimized the pain, cutting maintenance for swimming pools and beaches and tennis courts and closing all 33 of the city's mini-pools, for example, while planning deeper cuts in park maintenance only if conditions worsened. He will delay introduction of trash recycling in 10 districts but would reduce garbage collection only if the budget gap grew.
While Mr. Dinkins will leave unfilled through attrition or will eliminate through layoffs 5,400 jobs that had been planned, the part of the work force financed entirely by city money will still grow by more than 5,100 workers, to a projected 226,491 by next June. Over the last decade, the work force has grown by around 50,000 workers.
 
'The Right Direction'
 Raymond D. Horton, president of the Citizens Budget Commission, a private watchdog group financed by businesses, said the plan was a "step in the right direction, but not a big step." If tax revenues fall off more sharply than the city expects, he said, the budget "will have to be cut again, and valuable time will have been lost."
The city's Budget Director, Philip R. Michael, said the projected gap for the current year was based on an expected revenue shortfall of $180 million, especially in real-estate and income-based taxes, and $183 million in unexpected expenses.
Those expenses include an additional $59 million for welfare, $45 million for fuel and energy and $26 million to accelerate police hiring and pay other costs for Mr. Dinkins's anti-crime plan, for which the Mayor is still seeking $1.8 billion in special taxes over the next four years and whose approval is by no means certain.
Mr. Dinkins said it was too early to talk about what other taxes might be needed to keep the budget balanced next year, though he added that new taxes were a possibility.
As is usually the case with the city budget, Mr. Dinkins's plan was as notable for what it did not say as for what it did. Under pressure since agreeing to a 5.5 percent wage increase for teachers last month, the Mayor repeated yesterday that he would not use money directly from the city budget to grant raises of more than 1.5 percent to other unions still bargaining.
 
Harsh Criticism
 But the teachers' raise involved only 1.5 percent in previously budgeted funds, with the rest from excess pension funds and state aid to the Board of Education. That drew harsh criticism from fiscal monitors who said such money should be used to avoid service cuts or layoffs instead, but other unions have indicated that they, too, hope to use pension funds to support raises, and Mr. Dinkins has not ruled that out.
Yesterday, municipal union leaders seized on Mr. Dinkins's relatively moderate cuts to say that the administration's warnings of as many as 35,000 layoffs over the next two years had been vastly overstated.
"Clearly, the Mayor has come to our point of view," said Barry Feinstein, president of the 12,000-member Local 237 of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters. "We must deal with '92, but first you better take care of the contract for this year."
Mr. Proctor of the control board, while repeating his preference that any pension surpluses be used to close budget gaps, said the board recognized the city's prerogative to apply such money toward a labor settlement.

HEADLINE: Eye on Voters, Bush Resurrects Anti-Tax Pledge

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSENTHAL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 8

 BODY:
In a new twist to his political gyrations over taxes, President Bush promised today that he would never again break the no-new-taxes promise that he broke last summer in the Federal budget fight.
Beginning what he called the "remedial work" to reclaim his position in a divided Republican Party and heal his campaign wounds, Mr. Bush said he had "serious regrets" about "being forced" to abandon his central campaign promise to block any attempt to raise taxes. 
 In the first of two news conferences that highlighted a day of unusual Presidential visibility, he vowed that he would "absolutely" refuse to accept any increase in Federal income tax rates beyond those that he endorsed in the recent budget compromise.
 
A 2d Major Response to Vote
 Mr. Bush's latest vow on taxes, which was foreshadowed in a campaign appearance in Hawaii soon after the budget compromise was reached, was the second major political reaction to Tuesday's election results. Gov. Jim Florio of New Jersey said on Wednesday that the narrow victory of his fellow Democrat, Senator Bill Bradley, had prompted him to reassess his state program raising taxes.
Mr. Bush said he had never dropped his personal opposition to tax increases, and he accused the Democrats of plotting more of them when the newly elected 102d Congress begins its work in January. "They're going to do it over my dead veto, or live veto, or something like that, because it ain't going to happen, I'll guarantee you," he said.
Mr. Bush's vehement assurances that he would fight any income tax increases carried some of the air of political uncertainty that led to his decision to give his blessing to a tax increase as part of the budget compromise this year.
"Can I make the promise I won't support them?" Mr. Bush said. "Absolutely. You know, sometimes you run into some realities. But I'm girding up my loins to go into battle to beat back the tax attempts that I think are coming. Because I think the American people are fed up with it."
 
G.O.P. Sighs of Relief
 Mr. Bush said his compromise on taxes was not to blame for Republican losses on Tuesday, which he said were not as bad as the governing party usually suffers in a midterm vote.
But he acknowledged that the issue proved to be damaging for some incumbent governors who had first promised not to raise taxes and then did so, and some Administration officials said Mr. Bush's efforts to reclaim the Republican anti-tax platform were inspired to some degree by those election results.
The President's remarks prompted sighs of relief from party strategists who had been urging Mr. Bush to resume the no-taxes campaign much earlier. "Praise the Lord," said one senior Republican strategist.
Another top Republican, Thomas H. Kean, the former Governor of New Jersey, said: "There's a strong economic and political argument that this was the last time you should raise taxes. And where the Republicans should be placed is just in that position, as people who are really against taxes unless they are the only possibility to avert fiscal catastrophe."
Mr. Bush and his aides sought to play down Republican election losses on Tuesday, but the President seemed eager to capture some political momentum while Congress was not in session and to rebound from the weeks in which the White House was left reeling by Democratic attacks and Republican rebellions.
Before the election, when Mr. Bush was under intense assault over the budget, he refused to answer questions from reporters when he announced the resignation of Labor Secretary Elizabeth H. Dole, the first Cabinet official to quit his Administration.
 
New Bias Bill Promised
 Today, announcing the resignation of William Bennett as director of anti-drug programs, Mr. Bush lingered for more than half an hour to answer questions about politics, taxes and his relationship with Congress.
The President sought to recover from his veto of the 1990 civil rights bill by promising to send a new jobs discrimination measure to Congress next year.
He promised to renew his campaign for a reduction in the capital gains tax. And after weeks of enduring Republican criticism that he was too reluctant to attack the Democrats and too quick to abandon his pledge of "no new taxes," Mr. Bush tried to make up ground on both issues.
Asked if he would continue to strive for bipartisan cooperation with Congress, Mr. Bush complained about Democrats who "went out and tried to bash the President" in the campaign. Mr. Bush, who has exercised his veto 16 times in less than two years, warned that he was "more determined than ever" to use that power against Congressional Democrats.
"I was elected to take this country in a certain direction and the liberals in the Congress want to take it in another direction," he said.
 
Some See 'Chilling' Lessons
 White House aides argued that Tuesday's voting results posed no threat to Mr. Bush. But some Republicans inside and outside the Administration worried that the President's lieutenants might be underestimating his political vulnerability, particularly if the economy takes a further downturn.
"The lesson for the Bush Administration is a little more worrisome than conventional wisdom would have it," said a White House adviser. "The fate of governors who lost after first promising not to raise taxes and then doing so is chilling."
Mr. Bush said he planned to meet with his economic advisers to discuss ways to counter what he called "a slowdown in this economy."
"I want to be sure that to the degree a President can do something to soften the blow or to stimulate economic growth that he tries to do it," the President said.
A White House official said Mr. Bush would meet at Camp David on Friday with Vice President Dan Quayle; Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady; Richard G. Darman, the budget director; John H. Sununu, the chief of staff, and Michael J. Boskin, the chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers.
With the Congressional elections over, the political focus now turns to the President's own future, an issue about which Mr. Bush was reminded today when Mr. Bennett, the outgoing director of drug policy, breached political etiquette and talked about Mr. Bush's re-election prospects in the morning news conference.
As Mr. Bush stood at his side, clearly uncomfortable, Mr. Bennett said: "It's my belief, Mr. President, you will conclude this term very successfully. You will be re-elected as President of the United States in 1992. And in 1996 you will be thanked by your countrymen for a profound and great service."
Mr. Bush himself refused to say whether he would seek re-election in 1992, although few in Washington doubt that he will run.
A few minutes later, Mr. Bush was asked for his reaction to the re-election margins of two Democrats who are being mentioned as possible 1992 Presidential challengers, Gov. Mario M. Cuomo of New York, who won by less than expected, and Senator Bradley in New Jersey, who narrowly won. Mr. Bush said nothing; he just stood at the podium, grinning broadly.

Economic Stratagems
In the scramble to maintain their footing in a shrinking market, dozens of Manhattan restaurants are expanding their serving hours, opening second and cheaper restaurants or "down-menuing" with specially priced lunches and dinners.
The prix fixe seven-course dinner at Restaurant Lafayette, for example, is $95, but a streamlined sampling, a three-course lunch for $25, is now being served. Last week, the menu included starters like fresh shrimp in a spicy carrot-juice sauce, and pork cheeks pan-fried with a black-bean salad in an arugula vinaigrette. Main courses, like the cod cakes with an orange and basil oil, and the beef tenderloin stuffed with marrow and chive oil, were toothsome examples of the imaginative and energetic cuisine of the chef Jean-George Vongerichten. (Restaurant Lafayette, 65 East 56th Street; 832-1565).
Prunelle, the sleek, burled-wood-walled dining room, recently introduced a dinner menu that includes several homier French dishes -- and a $38 price tag for a three-course meal. Old-fashioned dishes like the onion soup and the cassoulet, as well as such contemporary fare as the scallops with a blini and three caviars, and the sweetbreads sauteed with wild mushrooms and wild rice, were all winners -- and the value is hard to beat in the tony, midtown restaurant league. (Prunelle, 18 East 54th Street; 759-6410).
Downtown, Anglers and Writers, an eclectic little storefront full of mismatched antique tables and china, fishing gear and lace doilies, is the winsome cafe-cousin of the Village Atelier restaurant. The owners, Craig Bero and his mother, Charlotte, serve good salads and sandwiches, a tender omelet and sturdy soups. It's hard to spend more than $10 for lunch, tea or dinner. And between the contemplative chamber music and the scratch of pen-to-notebook at the tables, the mood at Anglers and Writers recalls old Village Bohemia, an era when this kind of price and the ease to linger was not the exception but the rule. (Anglers and Writers, 420 Hudson Street, 675-0810).
 
The Changing Scene
 CLOSED: Huberts, a torchbearer of the New American cuisine that opened 15 years ago in Brooklyn, moved to the Gramercy area, and three years ago moved to Park Avenue.
NEW CHEF: Gerard Pangaud, who has moved from Aurora, Gerard's Place and La Belle Creole in the past year, is now chef of Le Comptoir, on East 67th Street.

Road Song
By Natalie Kusz
258 pages. Farrar, Straus & Giroux . $18.95
In 1969, Julius and Verna Kusz made up their minds to pack their four young children and whatever essential belongings they could fit in their green Rambler station wagon and a 12-foot trailer, and break away from it all. The 1968 recession had cost Julius his computer job in Los Angeles, but it was just as well. 
 "They had come," their oldest daughter, Natalie, writes in "Road Song," her harrowing yet inspiring memoir of their adventures, ". . . to distaste for civilization -- for its people, its small and self-absorbed borders -- and to impatience as well, a churning in their bellies to be elsewhere, in places much newer and still greatly older than this."
Life in Los Angeles, with its pinochle parties and church potlucks, seemed tame to a man who had spent his childhood on the run from Poland to the Ukraine to America escaping Nazis and the Soviet secret police, and to a woman from Vermont whose idea of living was "giving birth in the rice paddies and getting on with the job." They had a yearning for what a member of the family would call, with breathtaking understatement, "real things." And so one day they packed and headed north.
"Our first months in Alaska, that one long summertime before I was hurt, were hard," Ms. Kusz begins, ". . . but they were also very grand, full of wood fires and campgrounds, full of people and the stories they told at night when we ate all together, full of clean dust that we washed from our bodies with water carried home from cold springs."
 At first, the hardness involved rough roads, the scarcity of work, the incredible cold, and having to live in the slightly expanded trailer. Then one afternoon, the author, 7 years old by then, came home from school to find her mother not yet back from errands. She made her way to a neighbor's house that was surrounded by underfed huskies on tethers. She walked a narrow path that went through them to the front door, and had all but made it, when she decided to forgive their straining and snarling by laying her mittened hand on the head of the last dog. Her mother found her in the snow a short time later, picked her up, held her close, and prayed that the mutilated child would die.
It is a grueling story, told unflinchingly and made all the more fearsome by being repeated from several points of view. Further terrible things followed. There were years and years of reconstructive surgery -- often pointless because the author's body mysteriously rejected many of its own grafts -- until Ms. Kusz would grow sick at the very smell of ether.
There were the teasings and tauntings of other children -- a boy once punched her just to see what would happen to one of her wounds -- until Ms. Kusz learned to defend herself, then went on the offensive, becoming so skilled at fighting that she was accepted among the boys. Then she fell in love and got pregnant at the age of 16, partly to prove that she was female after all.
And there were many more sufferings, as if the accident had happened to test and twist the family. "In fact later," Ms. Kusz writes, "when each of us had pursued our own talents and found joy in them, it astonished us all to sit as an adult family reminiscing and to notice how disastrously modified we could have become -- like bonsai trees pruned at the hand of a perverse and lunatic gardener, malformed, as we all indeed were in small ways, by the inexplicable meanness of outsiders; yet, though the world had often been unkind to us, there were people in it who along the way had asked us questions which, as we found that we had so few answers, began our fruitful looking inward at each other, small periods of asking which disturbed and made us glad, for we found that between us our memory confirmed things we each had not realized were well known already by the others."
 It is absurd to speak of the family's courage; their braveness bordered on the foolhardy. It is silly to credit the Kuszes with pushing life to its limits, because that was not entirely the point, and anyway life pushed back too hard, forcing them to the caverns of death, whistling in that darkness.
Yet something about "Road Song" inspires a joy in the reader: the songs the family always sang while traveling, "the tones directed by breath and sustained until our very bones and their hollows resonated and increased with the joy of them." Or the language that grew out of their injuries and their sense of music: "And whatever small hurts they had come through before had always been used up in language, modeled into words, described and dissipated like elaborate and temporal sand sculptures built up on the tide line and abandoned."
Or the lesson they learned from their sufferings: "that a life proceeded upward as a series of eras, like layers of the forest floor, built higher and settling in and covering one another, over and over, growth and sudden decay and new growth, world without end."
Natalie Kusz survived her accident and all that happened in its wake, even the failure of her ambition to become a doctor. Finally losing interest in anatomy, she switched her college major to literature, moved with the daughter, from that childhood pregnancy, to St. Paul, where she now teaches writing in a small college.
She stays in close touch with her family. "Remember, Tochka," her father tells her in the epilogue of her memoir, "after all the long work, we have what we need. We never were called to build kingdoms." She concludes: "My father means, and the rest of us concur, that hopes are white stones shining up from the bottoms of pools, and every clear day we reach in up to the shoulder, selecting a few and rearranging the others, drawing our arms smoothly back into air, leaving no scar on the water."

Wild-Card Race Gives Redskins And Eagles Plenty of Motivation

BYLINE: By THOMAS GEORGE

 BODY:
The Washington Redskins' rematch against the Eagles on Monday night at Veterans Stadium in Philadelphia probably won't affect the National Conference East title chase. The Redskins (5-3) have lost twice to the 8-0 Giants, and although Philadelphia (4-4) has a Nov. 25 home game with New York, it has already dropped a game to the Giants.
The Redskins and the Eagles concede that if the Giants lose half of their remaining eight games -- and if either Washington or Philadelphia wins its final eight and thus the division -- it would qualify as a miracle. 
 Three National Conference wild-card spots are up for grabs, however, and the Redskins and the Eagles figure prominently in that race. The game Monday will offer the same hard-nosed, big-play football that has always characterized the teams' meetings, but with a twist: at quarterback for Washington, Jeff Rutledge, who at age 33 is in his 11th season, will make his 12th National Football League start and his first since 1987. And the Rutledge-Randall Cunningham face-off at quarterback should change the game's complexion.
In the teams' first meeting of 1990, three weeks ago, Washington won, 13-7, in a defensive-minded tussle where the Redskins asked the quarterback, Stan Humphries, to keep things simple and protect the football.
Since losing Mark Rypien to a knee injury early in the season, the Washington head coach, Joe Gibbs, has wavered in his confidence in Humphries's ability to throw downfield accurately. Last Sunday, with Washington facing a 21-point deficit against Detroit, Gibbs tossed his inhibitions and Humphries aside. Rutledge entered the game in the second half and threw for 363 yards and a touchdown on a variety of intermediate and deep passes, and the Redskins ended up winning, 41-38, in overtime.
With the Eagles' offense fresh from a 48-point outing against New England, a game in which Cunningham accounted for five touchdowns, expect more points to be scored in this Redskin-Eagle game. Cunningham was sacked five times by Washington in the first game, but Philadelphia did not sack Humphries, and did not manage a turnover (the only time that has happened in Buddy Ryan's five-year reign with the Eagles). Rutledge, though mobile, is not as elusive as Humphries.
In Rutledge, Gibbs knows what he loses -- and what he gains. "He gets the ball very quick," Gibbs said. "He makes great decisions. He's got great timing and a feel for when to get it in there. And he has football awareness that makes him the kind of quarterback that can get things done. He's also extremely mentally tough. I don't think you'll intimidate him, which is the No. 1 quality I'd like to have in a quarterback."
 
LOCAL TEAMS

 
Giants (8-0) at Los Angeles Rams (3-5)
 The last time these teams saw each other, Flipper Anderson was racing with a football through the end zone, through a tunnel and into the locker room after his game-clinching 30-yard catch in the Rams' 19-13 overtime playoff victory last January in Giants Stadium. On Sunday, the scene is Anaheim Stadium, and the teams' fortunes have reversed.
In the Rams' losses, their defense has allowed 36 points to Green Bay, 27 to Philadelphia, 34 to Cincinnati, 38 to Chicago and 41 to Pittsburgh. With a balanced attack, the Giants hope to exploit the Rams, too.
 
Miami (7-1) at Jets (4-5)
 Giants Stadium was the site of Miami's only loss this season, but that was to the Giants.
Miami has allowed 17 or fewer points in five straight games. The Jets know they can play with the Dolphins, having led, 13-0, at halftime before losing, 20-13, in Miami on Oct. 7. Mark Duper was the hero, scoring on a 13-yard catch with 1 minute 3 seconds left.
This time, the wide receivers Al Toon (31 receptions, 14.5 yards a catch, 4 touchdowns) and Rob Moore (25 receptions, 16.7 yards a catch, 2 touchdowns) and the Jets' defense hope to shine. The last time Miami swept the Jets, in 1984, it went to the Super Bowl.
 
NATIONAL CONFERENCE

 
Atlanta (3-5) at Chicago (7-1)
 "We're where we want to be except for the record; we had hoped we would could accomplish just what we have and still be on the winning side," Jerry Glanville, the Falcons' head coach, said this week.
The Bears' head coach, Mike Ditka, does not believe his team or any other at present ranks with the Giants and the 49ers, "but at the end, maybe we'll be there," he said.
The running back Neal Anderson is everything to the Bears' offense, but Atlanta's No. 1 priority with an eight-man front is to shut him down. This matchup will reveal where the Bears' passing game stands.
 
Minnesota (2-6) at Detroit (3-5)
 Wayne Fontes, the Lions' head coach, is taking heat for staying with the shoot part of his run-and-shoot offense in the second half against Washington with Detroit leading by 21 points. Dropped passes and misfired ones saved time on the clock and helped the Redskins' comeback.
Rodney Peete, with an injured hamstring, is out at quarterback for the Lions. Bob Gagliano is ready, but this would be a good spot for Andre Ware's first start.
 
Tampa Bay (4-5) at New Orleans (3-5)
 Tampa Bay started fast, but is fading much as it did last season, when it began 3-2 and dropped nine of its last 11 games. The Buccaneers will try Chris Chandler at quarterback in place of Vinny Testaverde. New Orleans is a dangerous club when it holds on to the ball. The Saints often don't, however; they rank last in the league in takeaway-giveway differential at minus-14.
 
San Francisco (8-0) at Dallas (3-6)
 "Our players know that sometimes strange things happen," said Jimmy Johnson, the Dallas head coach. "Granted, it would be a strange thing if we beat the 49ers."
It would be especially strange because on Sunday night, Joe Montana will be passing against a secondary that had only one interception in its first six games. San Francisco beat Dallas last season with Steve Young at quarterback and won all five of the teams' meetings in the 1980's. But Dallas still leads the series, 9-8-1.
 
AMERICAN CONFERENCE

 
Seattle (3-5) at Kansas City (5-3)
 The Seahawks beat the Chiefs, 19-7, three weeks ago in the Kingdome, but they haven't won in Arrowhead Stadium in 10 years and have swept their divisional rival only once since, in 1978. Dave Kreig, the Seattle quarterback, had four passes intercepted in the first 1990 meeting, but the Seattle defense made three sacks, recovered three fumbles and limited the Chiefs to 69 yards rushing. But having toppled the Raiders last Sunday, the Chiefs are a stronger and more confident team now.
 
Denver (3-5) at San Diego (4-5)
 The toe and arch injuries on John Elway's left foot will slow him but not prevent him from starting at quarterback against San Diego, a team that hounded him last season as Denver produced only 16 points in both a victory and a loss to the Chargers. San Diego plays five of its last six games against divisional opponents, with Kansas City and Seattle up next.
 
Indianapolis (2-6) at New England (1-7)
 Can New England beat anyone? Of course it can. The Patriots' victory this season was against the Colts, in the second week, 16-14. The Patriots have beaten the Colts in 11 of their last 13 meetings. A Colt loss here and Ron Meyer could follow Bud Carson into unemployment.
 
INTERCONFERENCE

 
Green Bay (3-5) at Los Angeles Raiders (6-2)
 "This is a minor setback, nothing major at all," Jay Schroeder, the Los Angeles quarterback, said after the Raiders were beaten last Sunday by the bitter cold and the stingy Kansas City defense. The Raiders believe the bye week before the Chiefs game hurt their momentum. They look to rebuild it against a team they have dominated since losing Super Bowl II to the Packers in 1968.
 
Phoenix (2-6) at Buffalo (7-1)
 This game is a mismatch in every way. Buffalo has outrushed its opponents by 50 yards and Phoenix has been outrushed by 157 yards; Buffalo has allowed only 14 sacks, Phoenix 23. Bruce Smith and the Bills' defense present myriad problems for Phoenix, but tackling Thurman Thomas and Andre Reed will likely prove to be the Cardinals' biggest problem.
(The teams in the American Conference Central Division -- Pittsburgh, Houston, Cincinnati and Cleveland -- have byes this weekend.)

HEADLINE: The Halfway President

 BODY:
George Bush's Presidency approaches the two-year mark in disrepair. If Mr. Bush is interested in finding out why, he would do well to look not at Tuesday's election returns but at his own conduct before and during the midterm campaign. His problems, not entirely of his own making, include a faltering economy, the threat of war in the Persian Gulf and a restless Republican Party. But the greater difficulty is that he seems to have no governing style or strategy that could help him regain the initiative.
By themselves, the election results inflicted only marginal damage. Much has been made of Mr. Bush's failure to carry Republican gubernatorial candidates to victory in Florida and Texas; but these were idiosyncratic races, and in any case the Republicans captured statehouses in California and several key Midwestern states, including Ohio and Michigan. In effect, the G.O.P. traded the Sun Belt for the Rust Belt. 
 Mr. Bush's weak hand in the Senate and House is now weaker still; the Democrats picked up one Senate seat and eight House seats. But the history of midterm races says the losses could well have been greater. Moreover, no strong Presidential contender emerged in the balloting, and two formidable Democrats, Mario Cuomo and Bill Bradley, displayed unexpected weaknesses.
In short, nothing happened Tuesday to prevent Mr. Bush from offering intelligent, forceful leadership in the next two years, or from articulating goals and convictions and mustering a principled defense of what he wants to achieve. But that will require a very different George Bush from the one who's been floundering around the country for the past six weeks.
Mr. Bush's biggest mistake during the Great Budget Battle, for example, was not his decision to drop his "no new taxes" pledge, as Representative Newt Gingrich and other aggrieved Republicans contend. The fundamental error was his failure to make a persuasive case about why deficit reduction was more important than keeping his pledge on taxes. He then compounded that failure by flipping and flopping on capital gains and higher income tax rates. In the resulting confusion, he ceded the political and legislative initiative to the Democrats.
Mr. Bush's characteristic insouciance did little to dispel the confusion. When exasperated reporters asked him to explain his position on taxes, he replied, as he jogged along, "Read my hips." That stood as the silliest comment of the campaign until Mr. Bush topped himself a few days later with the assertion that Saddam Hussein was worse than Hitler.
This sort of hey-what's-wrong-with-a-little-confusion attitude stopped being endearing a long time ago, but Mr. Bush remains partial to it. Only yesterday, at a news conference, he gave a less than ringing endorsement to the budget agreement and pledged -- again! -- "no new taxes."
The news conference displayed a man who looked to Tuesday's election returns to tell him what he ought to be next week. What he ought to be is the President. The more complex his problems become, especially in the gulf, the more he will be required to state his aims clearly -- and engage himself, as he has so far refused to do, in the ardent persuasion that democratic politics demands.

HEADLINE: Black History Is Central to American History

 BODY:
To the Editor:
You cast skeptical eyes on Afro centrists, who are "bringing tales of African kings and little-known black inventors, scientists and artists into the classroom" ("Inspirational Black History Draws Academic Fire," front page, Oct. 10). Traditional history has long relegated blacks, among others, to near invisibility, and many serious scholars are undertaking the task of restoring the balance. 
 Traditional history portrayed the peopling of America by the Spanish conquistadors, the French trappers and the arrival of Capt. John Smith and the Pilgrims, their descendants pouring through the gaps in the Appalachians and their descendants making their way in covered wagons to the other shining sea.
Bringing their British customs with them, the early colonists built a recognizable approximation of English society on these shores and founded a marchland of the European culture system on this continent.
For every white immigrant to the Western Hemisphere, four or five blacks were brought. Not until the middle of the 19th century did white immigration exceed black, making the hemisphere until that time (in the words of the economic historian David Eltis) an extension of Africa, rather than an extension of Europe. More of these blacks participated in the labor market, they worked longer hours, and what they produced was more valuable than free labor was able or willing to do.
It would be surprising if the world the immigrants founded was just like the one they left. The organization of society in England and Western Europe, based on a landed aristocracy and a free labor force, was never duplicated here. The British colonies in the North had no landed aristocracy, and without slaves there was none in the South and the Caribbean.
The simple farmers of British colonial America were hard pressed to do more than subsist and produce profitable export crops. The foreign earnings of British colonial America resulted overwhelmingly from the labor of plantation slaves. In the generation before the American Revolution, increasing numbers of slaves were dragged out of Africa, plantation crops poured out of the colonies, and with the earnings on these crops colonial merchants and planters, fishermen and farmers increasingly enjoyed imports of British goods.
The graceful Federal homes of New England merchants and the country houses of Georgian England owe a debt to the black slave, just as do the plantations and merchant houses of the Caribbean and the American South.
This is an example of the way traditional history has neglected the role of blacks in the growth of this country. We study African-American history not to assuage white guilt or to engender black pride, but to replace racist myths with a truer understanding of history.

HEADLINE: New York Needs Its Practical Nurse Programs

 BODY:
To the Editor:
I am writing to comment on your report that the New York State Education Commissioner, Thomas Sobol, is closing practical nursing programs in New York City high schools because they are not "turning out enough students who could pass the state licensing examination for practical nurses" (news article, Oct. 20). 
 In my opinion, the commissioner should re-evaluate his decision one more time. These programs offer a free opportunity for a student who has the interest and caring instinct to learn about nursing and to graduate with a marketable skill. This results in a more goal-oriented high school experience -- of great need in a time of increasing dropout rates and unemployment.
It is true that licensed practical nurses may not have very expanded roles in hospitals. Yet they function very well in nursing homes and in caring for those in the home. The palliative caring skills of practical nurses can come in handy with patients whose conditions are not serious and don't require the advanced care of a registered nurse.
I am a graduate of the practical nursing program at Hillcrest High School. I passed the licensed practical nurse state boards, recently graduated with a Bachelor of Science and am a registered nurse at a leading New York City hospital. I feel this program gave me a taste of nursing at an early time, which helped me set my future goals with more certainty.
Possibly the entire program can be gone over carefully to identify the true flaws that result in only a 47 percent passing rate among graduates. In this time of hospital overcrowding and of a nursing shortage, we must strike up an interest in nursing early in life, and these programs offer an excellent opportunity to do so. The high school practical nursing programs are much too valuable to those who can really blossom in them to be closed.

HEADLINE: Shots in Red Square Are Echo of a Thriving Market in Arms

BYLINE: By BILL KELLER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Nov. 8

 BODY:
The daily newspaper Komsomolskaya Pravda recently sent reporters out shopping for guns to dramatize the flourishing Soviet black market in arms.
After pricing weapons ranging from homemade zip guns to an imported Uzi automatic, they bought three grenade launchers to illustrate their front-page story. The newspaper said it turned down an offer of a tank at $10,000. 
 The account of the spread of weapons, published Tuesday, seemed prescient a day later when a man fired a sawed-off shotgun during the Revolution Day parade on Red Square, within earshot of President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
The K.G.B. announced today that criminal proceedings had been instituted against the gunman, who was identified as Aleksandr Shmonov, 38 years old, an unemployed fitter from Leningrad, Tass reported. An investigator said Mr. Shmonov had spoken in detail about the shooting, which the K.G.B. formally charged was a violation of the state law against the assassination of state figures.
There was no further detail offered of why this particular charge was used, or how specific Mr. Shmonov might have been in talking with K.G.B. interrogators.
 
The Biggest Puzzle
 Much about the shooting remained a mystery today, including the gunman's intended target and his state of mind, which was reported to be the subject of a psychiatric examination. But for those who have watched the growing confluence of guns and grievance in the Soviet Union, the biggest puzzle was why it had not happened sooner.
The new gun culture of the Soviet Union may be unremarkable by the standards of New York or Los Angeles, but in a society long regarded as an efficient police state the spread of weaponry in private hands has fascinated the press and alarmed the public as one more symptom of a system in breakdown.
"We never imagined that in principle anyone wanting a gun and having good money can quickly arm himself with the weapon of his choice," said the report in Komsomolskaya Pravda, the latest in a yearlong series of press reports about where guns come from, where they go, and what to do about them.
In the gun trade, the Soviet press has discovered one aspect of Soviet life where the market, unfortunately, works. Outside the law, the one law that is well observed is the law of supply and demand, and the liberation of the Gorbachev years has generated both.
The police attribute the growing demand for guns in part to the criminal rackets that thrive in the interstices between the dying state-run economy and the fledgling private enterprise legalized by Mr. Gorbachev's economic changes.
Favorite rackets include trafficking in stolen state property, extorting protection money from successful new entrepreneurs and profiteering in scarce goods, plus such conventional criminal enterprises as drugs and prostitution. As their businesses have become more lucrative and competitive, the racketeers have armed themselves to protect their turf, creating a spinoff trade in the tools of violence.
 
Less Fear of the Police
 With even entry-level thugs increasingly carrying firearms, the fear of crime has grown faster than crime itself. The anxiety is stimulated by frank and sometimes sensationalist crime reporting in the liberated press.
"Where can I buy a little pistol?" a woman inquired in a phone call to Komsomolskaya Pravda, the day after three thugs robbed her in broad daylight by the monument in Sverdlovsk Square.
Another factor has been the unleashing of ethnic rivalries, especially in southern republics. In Georgia and the combat zone along the border between Armenia and Azerbaijan, it is de rigueur for a nationalist politicians to have a group of gun-toting bodyguards at his side.
The rising fear of crime and ethnic hatred has been matched by a declining fear of the Government's deterrent powers. The police state depended not only on a large, ruthless and well-equipped police force, but also on the terrified compliance of the citizenry. That fear has largely dissipated, and nothing else -- respect for the rule of a gentler law, for example -- has yet replaced it.
A man might have to be crazy to brandish a shotgun on Red Square -- as Vladimir A. Kryuchkov, the K.G.B. chief, suggested Wednesday night after the gunman was arrested -- but not as crazy as before.
There are many sources to satisfy the demand for firearms, and they have expanded with the times. Soviet press estimates of the number of weapons in private hands range from 50,000 to 500,000.
 
Where the Guns Come From
 Many weapons were already in the hands of hunters and veterans returned from the bazaars of Afghanistan. Soviet newspapers say another common option is to buy or steal guns from police, military and security guards.
In regions of ethnic strife, looting of police and military arsenals has become rampant, sometimes reportedly with the complicity of sympathizers on the inside. Still more weapons have been misappropriated from weapons plants or from factories responsible for melting down old armaments.
"Then we must remember the so-called search groups that proclaim their good intention of locating and reburying the remains of soldiers killed during World War II," Komsomolskaya Pravda said. "In fact they are looking for, and finding, well-preserved weapons and ammunition of the war era."
The Soviet authorities say that liberalization of foreign travel has also opened up channels for the import of arms.
Komsomolskaya Pravda suggested that the Government exercise the only clout that counts in marketplace.
"We see only one way out: buying the weapons from the population," the newspaper said, proposing establishment of a state emergency fund to purchase weapons anonymously.
"Money," said the newspaper, "still has more power than the Interior Ministry and the K.G.B."

There is widespread fear that the coming winter will bring severe hardship. Fuel is already scarce. On Oct. 3, a Government spokesman announced an austerity program for industry, which is using 84 percent of the domestic energy output, so that more energy can be used for heating during the winter.
Western estimates say unemployment could rise to 350,000 at the end of 1990. According to Government predictions, unemployment in Romania will rise to up to 1 million, or 9.5 percent of the work force, in 1991.

Last Word on Taxes? Don't Hold Your Breath

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 8

 BODY:
The monumental Tax Reform Act of 1986, with its lower rates, fewer brackets and closed loopholes, was supposed to stay intact for many years, giving businesses, investors and ordinary families a stable tax system they could depend on to make financial plans.
But the politicians who called it the tax law to end all tax laws should have known better.
Last month, Congress used the deficit-reduction legislation to overhaul the system again. The rate on the highest incomes was raised to 31 percent, itemized deductions and personal exemptions were limited in a way that pushes that rate even higher, and the capital gains rate was capped at 28 percent, among other measures. 
 This time, no one is even pretending that the changes will be much more permanent than a soap bubble.
 The final T in the budget legislation had not even been crossed when a senior White House official summoned reporters to the Roosevelt Room to say -- not for attribution, of course -- that one of the first measures President Bush would offer next year would be to cut the capital gains rate.
That proposal will join many others on a full tax plate.
Representative Dan Rostenkowski of Illinois, chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, predicts that the phasing out of personal exemptions and the 3 percent reduction in itemized deductions for upper-income taxpayers will prove so complicated that there will be pressure to change the new system.
The majority leaders in Congress, Senator George J. Mitchell of Maine and Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, say the 31 percent top rate is still too low. "I don't think we ought to view this as some ending of the debate," Mr. Mitchell declared just before Congress adjourned.
Republicans like Senator Steve Symms of Idaho, a member of the Finance Committee, say they may press for tax cuts next year as an economic counterweight to the recession they expect.
Liberal Democrats promise that H.R. 1, the number assigned to the first bill introduced in each Congress, will be given in January to a bill to place a stiff surtax on people who earn $1 million a year or more.
Popular business tax breaks like the credit for research and development expenses and the deduction for employee tuition were extended for only a year, and it is unthinkable that Congress will allow them to expire at the end of 1991. The same is true of Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan's pet amendment to give a break to wealthy collectors who give artworks to museums.
Lobbyists for the real estate industry will be out in force. Ever since 1986, the industry has griped that Congress treated it unfairly by taking away cherished tax shelters. This year, with real estate going bust in many parts of the country, the industry got more than half the members of the Ways and Means and Finance Committees to sponsor the favorable tax treatment it wants. And realtors greased the way for 1991 by giving hundreds of thousands of dollars to lawmakers' campaigns.
So there will be plenty of talk about taxes next year. But whether much will happen is another matter.
President Bush said today that his concession on taxes this year was a one-time-only slip and that he would "absolutely" oppose further new taxes. After the pounding he took over supposedly favoring tax relief for the well-to-do, the President will have to think more than twice before throwing his full weight behind a capital gains cut.
And the timing may not be right for the Democrats' push for a surtax on incomes over $1 million. Good policy or not, soaking the fat cats has so much political appeal, especially in a sour economy, that many Democratic strategists are suggesting that the debate be postponed until 1992, the Presidenial election year.
Robert D. Reischauer, director of the Congressional Budget Office, says he expects tax issues "to slip off the front pages for a year."
But many other experts disagree. C. Eugene Steuerle, a senior tax policy official in the Reagan Administration who is now an economist at the Urban Institute here, compares the tax law to his daughter's room. When he makes her clean her room, Mr. Steuerle says, the mess disappears temporarily. But he is under no illusions that it will stay neat very long.

HEADLINE: Rodrigo Moynihan, 80, a Pioneer Of Abstract Painting in England

BYLINE: By JOHN RUSSELL

 BODY:
Rodrigo Moynihan, a painter and teacher and a co-editor of Art and Literature: An International Review, died Tuesday in London after a long illness. He was 80 years old.
Mr. Moynihan became known in the 1930's as a pioneer of English abstract painting. He later became an associate member of the Euston Road School in London and excelled as a painter of still lifes that were remarkable for their dignity of touch and tone. 
 He was in the British Army from 1940 to 1943 and was appointed an official war artist after being injured. His unsparing though compassionate account of army life in its gloomier aspects was lightened by a memorable portrait (done in the line of duty) of a young woman soldier.
After the war, he taught at the Royal College of Art, where he was professor of painting from 1948 to 1957. He was much in demand for portraits (notably of Princess Elizabeth, the future Queen, in 1946, and of Prime Minister Clement Attlee in 1947).
 
Large-Scale Portraits
 Mr. Moynihan also rose to the challenge of the large-scale group portrait in "Teaching Staff of the Painting School, Royal College of Art" (1947-52) and the larger "Editors of Penguin Books." As documents of postwar English life, they have a permanent value.
In 1957, when he was clearly destined for the topmost ranks of the British establishment, he decided to put his private self above his public self and resigned from both the Royal College of Art and the Royal Academy, of which he had been made a full member in 1954. He left England and lived and worked in Paris, Provence, New York and Canada.
With his second wife, the painter Anne Dunn, and with the American poet John Ashbery and Sonia Orwell, he edited the quarterly review Art and Literature from 1964 to 1968. It drew with notable discernment on contributors in England, France and the United States.
Neither in London nor in New York was there an immediate welcome for the radical abstract idioms that he explored after his break with English officialdom. But in 1971 he began to paint large-scale still lifes of whatever happened to be lying around in his studio. Neither set up nor "arranged," these were subjects, taken at random, that he endowed with a paradoxical monumentality.
 
Celebrated Sitters
 Later in the 1970's he also returned to portrait painting, and before long had a whole new reputation in that field. Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, the novelist Anthony Powell, the painters Francis Bacon, William Coldstream and Lawrence Gowing and the economist F. A. Hayek were among his sitters in London.
In 1978 he had a retrospective exhibition at the Royal Academy in London, which re-elected him to membership in 1979. From 1980 his work was shown to general admiration at the Robert Miller Gallery in New York. His 80th birthday, three weeks ago, was marked by ceremonies both at the Royal Academy and at the Tate Gallery.
Rodrigo Moynihan was born in Santa Cruz de Tenerife, Canary Islands, on Oct. 17, 1910. He was the son of Herbert James Moynihan, a fruit broker, and Maria de la Puerta.
In 1918, his family moved to London and then to Madison, Wis., where he attended high school. Incipient literary ambitions were abandoned during the winter of 1927-28, which he spent in Rome. Painting came first with him thereafter, and in September 1928 he enrolled at the Slade School of Fine Art in London.
In 1931 he married Elinor Bellingham-Smith, later to become a distinguished painter of landscape. In 1960 he married Anne Dunn, who survives him, as do two sons, John and Daniel.

HEADLINE: SPORTS OF THE TIMES;
Straw's $20 Million Burden

BYLINE: By DAVE ANDERSON

 BODY:
His father was George Sisler, a Hall of Fame first baseman for the St. Louis Browns who twice batted over .400. Dick Sisler was a first baseman whose three-run homer off Don Newcombe of the Brooklyn Dodgers on the final day of the 1950 season won the National League pennant for the Philadelphia Phillies. In that economy, his highest salary was $18,000.
"It doesn't bother me when I see the players making the big money today; more power to 'em," Sisler said after his recent retirement as a minor league hitting instructor for the St. Louis Cardinals. "But now it's like, 'Who can make the most money?' That's the motivator." 
 In all the debate on today's sports millionaires, nobody has summed it up better. In other eras, sluggers talked about trying to hit the most home runs, trying to drive in the most runs, trying to win the batting title. Pitchers talked about trying to win 20 games or trying to have the lowest earned run average.
But for too many baseball players now, and for too many professional athletes, it's trying to make the most money. As soon as another player attains a new million-dollar plateau, they want to renegotiate. As if the numbers on their paycheck are the only numbers that reflect their accomplishments. Or their stature.
That's why the Mets won't miss Darryl Strawberry that much. And that's why the Los Angeles Dodgers, who have invested $20.25 million in him, won't be helped that much. Straw always resented his being expected to carry the Mets; in his naivete, he has even talked about how his burden would be lighter with the Dodgers.
Maybe Straw thinks he's going home to play for Crenshaw High School, as he did as a teen-ager. Maybe he thinks the Dodger fans aren't going to expect $20 million worth of home runs.
Whatever Straw thinks, he will discover that his burden will be even heavier in Dodger Stadium. His new manager, Tommy Lasorda, is already hyping him as a slugger "that can literally carry a ball club." Please erase that tape before Straw hears it. Or before he strikes out and the fans dare to boo him.
"If you get the money," Reggie Jackson has said of Jose Canseco's $23 million contract, "you can't say, 'I don't want the pressure.' "
Not that Darryl Strawberry didn't deserve big money. But money seemed to be the only straw that stirred him. When the Mets offered only a three-year, $9.1 million contact, he pouted. When the Mets' general manager, Frank Cashen, proclaimed that Straw was not worth $5 million a season, he felt "insulted." He wanted "Canseco money."
In the end, the Dodgers didn't consider him a $5 million man either. His deal averages $4 million a season.
Not bad for having carried the Mets for only one-fourth of their season: in 39 games from May 26 to July 13, Straw batted .383 with 18 homers and 42 runs batted in as the Mets ascended briefly into first place before settling into second place.
"I like what I see here," he said during that hot streak, glancing around the Mets' clubhouse. "And I want to be part of it."
But as soon as the Mets broke off negotiations on July 13, apparently he didn't like what he saw and he didn't want to be part of it anymore. His average, which coincidentally had soared to .308 that same day, started dropping to .277, with 37 homers and 108 runs batted in.
Anyone who blames the Mets' front office for not signing him in July should also consider blaming him for cruising after the negotiations broke off. If he had carried the Mets to the National League East title, their front office might have paid him more than the Dodgers did.
Like too many athletes today, Straw was more concerned with his contract than with carrying his team.
It's easy to cherish Straw's hot streak shortly after Bud Harrelson succeeded Davey Johnson as manager. But in his other 113 games before and after that streak, he batted a mortal .239 with 19 homers and 66 runs batted in. He hit some important September homers but for the final week he was in the clubhouse with a bad back.
Another thought: will he miss Dr. Alan Lans, the Mets' counselor who suggested his four-week stay at the Smithers Institute for alcohol-abuse early this year?
 As for the Mets, yes, they need a slugger now. Tom Brunansky, George Bell and Rob Deer are free agents. So is Kirk Gibson, although he'll be 34 in May and he's damaged goods.
No matter how the batting order is retooled, the Mets might be no worse and maybe better. The other hitters won't be waiting for Straw to carry them when he resented the responsibility of being expected to carry them.
And now that Darryl Strawberry is a $20 million man, will he able to do what he has never wanted to do: carry the burden of carrying his team?

HEADLINE: The National Ends Its Sunday Issue

BYLINE: By N. R. KLEINFIELD

 BODY:
Feeling the pressures of a sagging economy, The National, the fledgling sports daily, said yesterday that it would stop publishing a Sunday issue and that it was undergoing some management changes.
The moves raised renewed questions about the long-term prospects for the newspaper, the first attempt at a nationally distributed daily that covers only sports. Since its debut on Jan. 31, The National has grown more slowly than anticipated, and despite some high-priced writing talent its editorial content has drawn a tepid response from some readers. 
 With the elimination of the Sunday paper, after publication of the Nov. 25 issue, The National will appear only on weekdays; it has never published on Saturdays. A spokesman said that Sunday circulation had been running about 225,000, significantly below the 275,000 weekday average, and that there had been distribution problems with the Sunday issue. What is more, the paper said it wished to marshal its resources to concentrate on faster expansion to other cities.
In another sign of dissatisfaction, three of the paper's seven managers were dismissed on Thursday, including the circulation director, the finance director and the assistant publisher. Replacements were not named.
In addition, an executive associated with the primary backer of The National will soon be brought in to preside over day-to-day operations, which had been the province of Peter O. Price, the president and publisher. The new executive is Jaime Davila, the group vice president of Univisa Inc., a diversified Los Angeles media concern owned by Emilio Azcarraga, a Mexican communications executive who heads the partnership that operates The National. Mr. Davila will retain his position with Univisa.
The paper said Mr. Price, a former publisher of The New York Post, would retain his titles, though his Manhattan office would be given to Mr. Davila. Mr. Price will move to the nearby advertising office.
Mr. Price declined to comment yesterday. A spokesman for the paper would not detail the reasons for the managerial changes and said other executives were not available to comment.
The spokesman said the end of the Sunday paper was not expected to lead to editorial layoffs, since the staffing would be necessary as the paper moves into new markets. Others at the paper said, however, that a small number of jobs might be eliminated. The paper employs about 200 on its editorial staff.
 
 'Probably Inevitable'
 "The Sunday closing was probably inevitable in view of the current weak advertising climate," said John Reidy, a media analyst at Smith Barney, Harris Upham. "This was the hardest issue to make work because you don't get people traveling around to their various endeavors, as you do during the week."
The National was initially distributed in three cities -- New York, Chicago and Los Angeles -- and has expanded to six others: San Diego, San Francisco, Dallas, Detroit, Boston and Miami. The Miami edition began publishing on Wednesday.
Next month, an edition is scheduled to begin in the Washington-Baltimore area, followed by Philadelphia in January and Atlanta in February.
 
 Gains From Daily News Strike
 But expansion has come more slowly than planned. Initially, the paper's executives hoped to be in 15 cities by the end of this year. In April, Mr. Price revised that to 12 cities with average circulation approaching 400,000. The ultimate circulation goal is one million.
Executives did note that they had captured some added circulation in the last few weeks as a result of the strike at The Daily News in New York. They insist that the paper remains viable and that Mr. Azcarraga has approved its budget for next year. He has said he is prepared to invest $100 million over five years.
The paper would not estimate how much of that amount had been consumed so far, though John Morton, an analyst with Lynch, Jones & Ryan in Washington, said, "It's probably going much faster than they thought."
Since the paper was first announced, many media analysts and editors have questioned whether enough readers and advertisers would support a national sports daily.
 
 Average of 5 Ad Pages
 Advertising pages have hardly been bountiful, though the paper's executives maintain that they have surpassed their modest early predictions. They said that The National had averaged about five pages of advertising in each issue and that they had forecast about four when the paper was started. The National generally runs 38 to 48 pages.
Editorially, The National has drawn mixed reviews. The paper said it was chiefly bought by men between 18 and 34 years old with median incomes of more than $34,000. Though the paper has been enterprising in some of its features and news articles, some readers have said it does not provide enough fresh material that cannot be found in the sports pages of general daily papers or in USA Today, a chief rival.
"The summaries and the box scores are really outstanding," said Gabe Buonauro, the sports editor of The Record in Bergen County, N.J. "As far as the editorial content, I'm not overwhelmed."
Frank Deford, a much-admired writer at Sports Illustrated before he joined The National as its editor, was traveling yesterday and could not be reached for comment.
The paper said that when the Sunday issue ended it intended to enlarge its Friday and Monday papers to more than 60 pages.

HEADLINE: Oil Declines $1.64, to $33.89; Selloff Follows Iraq Rumor

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Oil prices fell sharply near the close of trading yesterday on a rumor of an Iraqi coup.
Oil had already been moving lower, as traders decided they had bid prices too high Thursday on erroneous speculation that President Bush was about to announce steps leading to an immediate conflict in the Persian Gulf. 
 "People aren't expecting any gunfire until next year now," said Thomas P. Blakeslee, an energy analyst with Pegasus Econometric Group Inc. in Hoboken, N.J.
The coup rumor floated in with about a half-hour left to trade, pushing the already depressed price down an additional 60 cents.
 
 One Trader's Reaction
 "That probably just fueled things a little bit," said Ed Kevelson, a trader at Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.
Crude oil for December delivery settled at $33.89 a barrel, down $1.64, on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Contracts for delivery in later months all closed more than $1 lower.
For the week, crude fell 11 cents a barrel for next-month delivery.
Oil opened lower yesterday as traders decided they had overestimated the impact of a news conference President Bush had given the evening before.
During Thursday's session, oil shot up as traders speculated that Mr. Bush's statement, which came after the market closed, would include either an ultimatum to President Saddam Hussein of Iraq or a vow to airlift supplies to the American Embassy in Kuwait.
Mr. Bush instead said he was substantially increasing the American military presence in the gulf, which traders had already anticipated.
"I think people were expecting some type of ultimatum, and what they received was the same old thing," Mr. Blakeslee said.
 
 Worried About Weekend
 Traders at the New York Mercantile Exchange have recently been wary about entering the weekend with speculative positions, so some of yesterday's selloff came as they sold oil contracts.
The decline in crude oil also dragged down the price of refined products traded on the exchange.
Wholesale home heating oil dropped 4.06 cents, to 90.24 cents a gallon for December delivery, while December wholesale unleaded gasoline fell 2.28 cents, to 88.23 cents a gallon. Contracts for later months were all lower for both products.
For the week, heating oil rose 2.82 cents for next-month delivery, while unleaded gasoline fell 0.98 cent.
Natural gas prices were lower or unchanged yesterday, with December delivery contracts falling six-tenths of a cent, to $2.429 for 1,000 cubic feet. For the week, next-month contracts for natural gas were up 7.1 cents.

HEADLINE: Interest-Rate Drop Pushes Dow Up 44.80

BYLINE: By ROBERT J. COLE

 BODY:
A strong decline in interest rates, plus the prospect of more to come, lifted the stock and bond markets sharply yesterday.
Trading was slow but the advance carried the Dow Jones industrial average ahead 44.80 points, to 2,488.61.
Heavy declines on Tuesday and Wednesday, however, toppled the Dow's performance for the week to a loss of 2.23 points. 
 Abby Joseph Cohen, market strategist for Goldman, Sachs & Company, attributed yesterday's strong showing partly to "the hope that we're closer to a resolution in the Middle East." President Bush has just ordered more than 150,000 additional American troops to the Persian Gulf.
 
 Favorable Price Report
 But Mrs. Cohen said that more important yesterday was the decline in interest rates stemming from the better-than-expected report on the Producer Price Index.
The Labor Department said the index climbed 1.1 percent last month after rising 1.6 percent in September and 1.3 percent in August. But the report showed no rise in core producer prices, excluding food and energy.
"Equity investors are doing the natural thing," she said. "Lower interest rates are good for stocks. However, I think it's a mistake because interest rates are falling due to a weak economy.
"A weak economy is good for bond prices but not for stock prices and that's because pressure on the economy means pressure on corporate profits."
Mrs. Cohen said she looked for a further market decline: "I think that while investors are focusing on the positive aspects of lower interest rates, stock prices can rise somewhat. However, I don't think it's sustainable. Corporate profits will continue to be weak and continue to come in lower than expectations."
Traders turned yesterday to all the usual suspects in explaining the market's rise. With the likelihood that war, if it indeed comes, may not come until after the holiday season, crude oil prices fell sharply, sliding $1.64 a barrel, to $33.89.
Some said that because of the admittedly sluggish economy and almost daily signs that it was weakening still more, they were looking for the Federal Reserve to take action soon and cut rates.
The most likely time, they said, could be soon after next Tuesday when the Fed's Open Market Committee discusses monetary policy. What to do about interest rates is expected to be high on its agenda.
Interest-sensitive stocks, including banks, savings and loans, and utilities, moved sharply higher yesterday along with drugs, high-tech stocks and oil and oil-service stocks.
 
 An Extensive Rise
 The rise was extensive, spreading broadly and, for a change, into the smaller issues.
Trading slowed to 145.2 million shares, from a thin 155.6 million on Thursday.
A solid 1,123 stocks, of the nearly 2,000 on the Big Board, rose and only 453 fell. While the Dow's 44.80-point gain meant more than a 1.8 percent rise, the S.&P. 500 rose 1.99 percent, or the equivalent of 49-point jump in the Dow. The Nasdaq composite index, heavily weighted with smaller high-tech stocks, climbed 1.7 percent, the equivalent of about 39 points on the Dow.
I.B.M., to which hundreds of traders look for leadership, jumped 2 3/4, to 110 1/4, its high for the day. It was the Big Board's most active stock, with 2.3 million shares changing hands.
Not far behind, Honeywell rose 2 1/2, to 89 5/8; Compaq Computer 1 3/8, to 49 1/8; Digital Equipment 1, to 49 3/8 and Motorola 1 3/8, to 55 5/8. On Nasdaq, Apple Computer topped the actives, rising 1, to 35 1/2, on 1.8 million shares.
 
 Gains for Banks
 Among the banks, BankAmerica rose 1 1/4, to 22 1/4; Wells Fargo 2 5/8, to 49 3/8; J .P. Morgan 1 1/4, to 40 1/2; Mellon Bank 1 1/4, to 21 5/8; Bankers Trust New York 1 1/8, to 35 and First Chicago 1, to 15. Golden West Financial, the savings and loan, rose 1, to 21 5/8.
In the utilities, Citizens Utilities rose 1 1/2, to 22 1/2; Hawaiian Electric 1 3/8, to 29 1/2; Central and South West 1, to 43 1/8; General Public Utilities 3/4, to 46, and Duke Power, the fourth-most-active Big Board stock, up 1/4, to 30 3/8, on nearly two million shares. Southwestern Public Service, ninth most active, rose 3/8, to 28 3/4, on 1.5 million.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Drops in a Slow Day; Fears Over Economy Cited

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar fell broadly in slow trading yesterday, largely amid concerns over the United States economy.
Gold fell in slow domestic trading, depressed by a lack of volatile news about the Middle East standoff, analysts said. It fell $2.50 an ounce, to $384.80, on the Commodity Exchange in New York. The Republic National Bank of New York later quoted a bid of $384.40, down $2.75. 
 With New York currency markets closed Monday, in observance of Veterans Day, traders stocked up on the dollar in advance of a possible heightening of tension in the Persian Gulf during the three-day weekend.
The dollar is generally viewed as a relatively safe investment in turbulent times. In addition, traders said, possible oil shortages could hurt Japan's economy and help diminish the yen's value against the dollar. But before the day's end, currency trading in New York had slowed considerably.
Analysts said that a big influence on the dollar was an earlier Labor Department report showing that the nation's "core" inflation rate -- the Producer Price Index minus food and energy costs -- remained unchanged in October from the month before.
 
Lower Rates Expected

Investors sold on this sign of moderating inflation, seeing it as giving the Federal Reserve some room to ease interest rates to stimulate economic growth. Lower interest rates can have a chilling effect on the value of the dollar.
"You're starting to build up a fairly reasonable case for at least a quarter of a percent cut," said Robert Hatcher, a corporate dealer at Barclays Bank P.L.C.
In New York, the dollar dipped to 129.70 yen, from 130.35 yen on Thursday. Earlier in Tokyo, the dollar rose by 1.00 yen, to 130.50. Later, in London, it was quoted at 129.75 yen.
In New York, he British pound rose to $1.9655, from $1.9625 on Thursday. In London, the pound was quoted at $1.9670, unchanged from late Thursday.
Against the German currency, the dollar fell to 1.4870 marks from 1.4930.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Thursday's rates, were: 1.2499 Swiss francs, down from 1.2535; 4.9940 French francs, down from 5.0105; 1,119.00 Italian lire, down from 1,122.75, and 1.1683 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1694.
Gold prices fell in early trading in London to a late bid of $384.75 an ounce, down from $385.75 late Thursday.

HEADLINE: Jersey City Complex Owners Default on Their Mortgage

BYLINE: By ALAN FINDER

 BODY:
In an indication of the New York region's weakening real-estate market, the owners of the huge Newport development in Jersey City have defaulted on a $150 million mortgage for four apartment towers, New Jersey state officials say.
The partners in the development team include Samuel J. LeFrak and his son, Richard, whose real-estate holdings are among New York's most substantial. The complex on the Hudson River waterfront, which includes apartments, a shopping mall and offices, has been a centerpiece in efforts to redevelop the riverfront.
Many owners of rental apartment buildings, squeezed by the economic retrenchment and a dearth of young, high-salaried tenants, are finding themselves burdened by falling rents and high turnover. 
 Last July, Milstein Properties, a family-owned business that is also among the region's wealthiest and most respected developers, defaulted on a $100 million mortgage for the Normandie Court, a large rental complex on East 96th Street.
Richard LeFrak, the president of the Lefrak Organization, said that his development group had lost $12 million to $14 million on the Newport apartment complex over the last few years. The group also includes Melvin Simon & Associates of Indianapolis and the Glimcher Company of Columbus, Ohio.
Mr. LeFrak said there had been a lot of turnover and that rents were below projected levels, making it difficult to pay the mortgage. He said his group hoped to maintain ownership and to reorganize the financing for the four towers, which have 1,504 apartments altogether.
 
'Misjudged the Growth'
 "This is symptomatic of all these new projects," Mr. LeFrak said. "All of us somewhat misjudged the growth that was going to occur in the metropolitan area."
"We're in a market in which there is a tremendous amount of turnover, which is a result of the loss of jobs in the financial community," he added. "This job is directly affected by that."
The state agency holding the mortgage for Newport, the New Jersey Housing and Mortgage Finance Agency, has agreed to try to negotiate refinancing with the developers and the Federal Department of Housing and Urban Development, which insured the mortgage. State bonds were sold in 1985 to finance the mortgage.
Federal officials are reviewing a proposal from the developers, said a H.U.D. spokesman, Bill Glavin.
New Jersey declared the owners in default last week, after they had missed a $1.1 million payment due on Oct. 1 and had failed to pay the full amount due the previous month. The default was first reported in The Bond Buyer, a trade publication.
In a statement, the state agency said the developers had not been timely in their mortgage payments since last May. It also said the developers had indicated last month that they would make no more payments.
New Jersey has not defaulted on the bonds, the agency said, and the mortgage is fully insured by the Federal Government. Mr. LeFrak said the developers' default will not affect tenants or services at Newport.
Mr. LeFrak also said the default would have no impact on the rest of his family's real-estate empire. "I don't want people to confuse this with a LeFrak corporate obligation or a LeFrak personal obligation or a project that is 100 percent LeFrak financed," he said.
The nature of Newport's corporate structure left none of the developers personally responsible to cover the apartment towers' operating losses, but they chose to do so anyway, Mr. LeFrak said.
"Faced with the current market, it's just good sense to see if some kind of a repackaging can be done," he said. "If we can come up with some restructured form of financing, we're confident that the project over time will be financially healthy."
"We've always been associated with successful things," he added, "and I'm sure we'll get this thing on track, too."

HEADLINE: MIDEAST TENSIONS;
U.S. Envoy to U.N. on Center Stage

BYLINE: By PAUL LEWIS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Nov. 9

 BODY:
America's United Nations representative, Thomas R. Pickering, celebrated his 59th birthday on Monday by taking the president's chair at a Security Council meeting for the first time since the Persian Gulf crisis broke.
The occasion was a formality. The Council convened merely to retain United Nations military observers serving in Central America. 
 But the remainder of the United States' monthlong stint in the rotating presidency -- each of the 15 Council members holds the chair for one month at a time -- promises to be more trying, for Mr. Pickering will be struggling to preserve the Council's unified approach on Iraq's invasion of Kuwait as that unity comes under pressure from several directions.
Mr. Pickering says that United States policy toward the gulf crisis is in "a holding pattern" while Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d confers with America's allies in the gulf as well as with Soviet and Chinese leaders about the crisis. But Mr. Baker's aides say a consensus is emerging that Washington should soon seek a new Security Council resolution authorizing the use of force when they deem that sanctions have failed to free Kuwait.
 
A Constantly Active Man
 A tall, balding, constantly active figure with large gold glasses, Mr. Pickering brings to his task a bluff manner, a reputation for effectiveness, a taste for cordless telephones and what Edward C. Luck, head of the American branch of the United Nations Association, calls "a boyish enthusiasm" for the task at hand. He has a self-effacing wit and the professional diplomat's ability to listen, or at least give the impression of listening, to another's point of view.
Over the years, Mr. Pickering has also won a reputation for being tough-minded in a number of difficult posts. In El Salvador in the early 1980's, probably his most difficult assignment, he was given the task of cutting down the power of the right-wing death squads and found himself marked for assassination. When he was named by President Bush to the United Nations assignment, after a grueling few years as Ambassador to Israel, Mr. Pickering had no way of knowing in 1989 that he would be thrust 18 months later into the forefront of American policy making.
Since Iraq invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2, he has shepherded the Council through a total of 10 resolutions condemning Iraq's takeover and imposing economic sanctions on Baghdad by comfortable margins with never less than 13 of its 15 members in favor.
More important than his work in the Council has been his voice in policy-making circles, where he has repeatedly called for long-range planning on the Persian Gulf going beyond today's tactics, and his advocacy of going step-by-step through the Council even when some others in Washington argued for unilateral American actions.
 
Relies on Personal Contact
 The two odd members out, Yemen, one of the Arab League countries that refused to condemn the invasion, and Cuba, "present problems but not unmanageable ones," Mr. Pickering said. They have abstained on three resolutions, and voted jointly against one, while Cuba opposed another.
To preserve this coalition, Mr. Pickering says he relies heavily on "a lot of personal contact," particularly with the representatives of the nonaligned countries who are often given "loose instructions by their capitals which allow them flexibility."
But also important is what he calls "the reinforcing alliances" he seeks to create within the Council's membership. First, agreement must be forged with Britain, France, the Soviet Union and China, the other permanent members with veto powers. Then he seeks to draw in the other northern members, Canada, Romania and neutral Finland.
Once this bloc is formed the three African members espousing nonalignment, Zaire, Ivory Coast and Ethiopia, face strong pressure to agree as well, as do Malaysia and Colombia, who have voted with the permanent five all the time so far.
 
Strains Starting to Emerge
 But this month, with sanctions largely in place, strains in the alliance are starting to emerge.
On Wednesday, the Security Council started debating the recent violence in the Israeli occupied territories, with many members saying it cannot punish Iraq for annexing Kuwait while turning a blind eye to Israel's annexation of Arab lands.
The United States can always use its veto to protect Israel. But Mr. Pickering also knows that his freedom to use that veto is restricted by the need to preserve the American-led Arab coalition against Iraq for as long as the Gulf crisis lasts.
Meanwhile, four of the Security Council's seven nonaligned members -- Malaysia, Colombia, Yemen and Cuba -- have introduced a new peace plan of their own, apparently trying to foreclose any move toward war now that economic sanctions are in place.
 
Calls Tensions Inevitable
 Finally, Iraq is seeking to divide the coalition ranged against it by asking the United Nations General Assembly to declare the foreign military build up in the gulf "a threat to Arab and international peace and security."
Mr. Pickering sees such tensions as inevitable and concludes that the majority in the Council "requires constant attention."
To that task he brings the professionalism of a Foreign Service officer who is only the second career diplomat selected straight from the Foreign Service to be entrusted with a post most Presidents have reserved for political appointees. The other was Charles W. Yost, who served from January 1969 to March 1971.
The choice of a career diplomat, many here thought, reflected the new President's personal interest in the organization, which stemmed from his own experience as the United States representative from 1971 to 1973.
 
Relationship With Baker
 But when President Bush gave Mr. Pickering the job 18 months ago, the new envoy was not given the Cabinet seat many of his predecessors enjoyed, thus reducing his personal prestige and influence in Washington, though other diplomats say he has partly compensated for this through competence and an easy relationship with Mr. Baker.
Indeed, many see the fact that he is not seeking to advance a political career as a positive advantage that allows the United States Mission to run at a smoother pace than was sometimes the case in the past.
A graduate of Bowdoin College in Brunswick, Maine, the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University and Melbourne University in Australia, Mr. Pickering has long been recognized as an exceptionally able diplomat destined for the top.
Before coming to the United Nations he had already showed himself to be an effective diplomat in a number of sensitive posts around the world. He was Ambassador to Jordan from 1974 to 1978 and then Ambassador to Nigeria before going to El Salvador and Israel.
 
Holds a 'Premoniton'
 Mr. Pickering says he has never asked why President Bush chose him, although he admits to having a "premonition" that his Central American and Middle Eastern experience would become useful, "which has been amply justified."
A serious-minded person who colleagues sometimes find humourless, Mr. Pickering is married with a son and daughter and gives archeology as his hobby. The United Nations, of course, denies him the chance to go "visiting sites and collecting shards and things." But even if it didn't, the Security Council would, with its frantic schedule since the gulf crisis began.
He acknowledges the strain this puts on everyone "especially spouses who don't know what's going to be canceled." But so far he hasn't missed one of his own dinner parties in the apartment on top of the Waldorf Towers that serves as his residence.

HEADLINE: Brazil Under Pressure to Ease Stance on Debt

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
Brazil, the developing world's biggest debtor, is under increasing pressure from commercial bankers and American and other officials to take a less adamant stand in crucial debt talks. They are pressing Brazil to begin paying some back interest.
Bankers on the negotiating committee, which quickly rejected Brazil's first debt-reduction proposal last month, have made a counterproposal that would require that roughly a third of the $8 billion in unpaid interest be paid by the end of the year. The rest would be converted to long-term loans and added to the existing debt. 
 And bankers do not want to begin negotiating a cut in the country's $60 billion in debt to them until the arrears issue is resolved. Incuding governmental and bank loans, Brazil's overall debt is about $113 billion.
 
 Discussions on Aid
 In addition, a banker said yesterday that there were discussions in Washington about delaying or stopping some payments to Brazil from the World Bank and the Inter-American Development Bank if the country continued to stall on interest payments. Brazil has refused to make any payments this year and has limited interest payments next year to no more than $1 billion.
The negotiations have also been complicated by another issue: the Brazilians' refusal to pay the expenses of bankers for travel to the talks, lawyers' fees and some food.
Some bankers seem less confident now that the Brazilian Government, facing new problems with its economic program, is ready to make the compromises needed to reach an agreement on reducing the country's debt.
This is a reversal for many who had applauded the economic program that President Fernando Collor de Mello began this year and those who thought last spring and summer that the debt talks could move ahead.
"Inflation is going through the roof again," said one banker involved in the talks. "It was close to 15 percent last month and could be close to 18 percent to 20 percent this month. That could blow the economic program through the roof."
These renewed economic problems -- and the apparent political need at home for the Collor Government to look tough in these debt negotiations -- is leading some bankers to conclude that the Government will not negotiate seriously.
The Bush Administration has been putting pressure on Brazil to make a better effort to begin paying some of the unpaid interest. Officials of the United States Treasury, the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund have indicated that they will delay final approval of Brazil's $2 billion standby loan until some action is taken. Initial approval came this summer.
 
 More Talks on Tuesday
 Brazil's negotiators are scheduled to meet again with the bank advisory committee on Tuesday and William R. Rhodes, senior executive-international at Citibank, said he expected a reply then. Citibank, a Citicorp unit, leads the negotiating panel.
Except for Argentina, Brazil's is the last major debt-reduction negotiation under the Bush Administration's debt policy, which was announced in March 1989 and named for Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady. Its aim was the voluntary reduction of the developing world's debt burden, which totaled $1.3 trillion.
But while the outlook for Brazil may be deteriorating, some bankers see improvements in Argentina, where recent statistics show that inflation may be finally coming down. In addition, on Thursday, the Government finally signed the papers that split the country's telephone company into two privately held companies, the first big privatization project completed under the Government's economic plan.
Bankers will meet with the president of Argentina's cental bank on Wednesday to begin a general discussion about debt talks. And some bankers, who had not been optimistic about the success of Argentina's economic program or debt negotiations, are now less worried.

HEADLINE: Producer Prices Post 1.1% Jump

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 9

 BODY:
Prices at the producer level, a prominent inflation gauge, jumped more than expected in October as oil prices continued to escalate, but economists generally took the numbers in stride.
The advance in the Producer Price Index for Finished Goods was a high 1.1 percent, the third consecutive month with a rise above 1 percent. Economists noted, however, that the Labor Department's report today showed no change in producer prices when energy and food, which are subject to big gyrations, were excluded. 
 The report, in fact, was seen by many as strengthening the case for the Federal Reserve to push short-term interest rates down another notch to counter what is widely seen as incipient recession.
 
 Reaction in the Markets
 Financial markets rallied today, apparently in expectation of lower rates. Oil prices fell, with the contract for December delivery down $1.64, to $33.89 a barrel, on the New York Mercantile Exchange. [Page 32.]
"The flat core rate ought to cool off some of the inflation psychology that's flying around out there," said Ron Schreibman, vice president of the National Association of Wholesaler-Distributors, a trade group whose members pay the prices measured by the index for finished goods. Those prices are one step removed from the consumer level.
The core, or underlying, rate is what remains when economists strip away volatile components, generally energy and food, that can mask the basic inflation trend. Oil prices have doubled since August even though the loss of Iraqi and Kuwaiti oil has now been entirely offset by higher production elsewhere.
 
 Fed Committee to Meet
 Analysts said the lack of any underlying inflation at the producer level last month would certainly be noted by the Fed's Open Market Committee when it meets on Tuesday to decide on monetary policy tactics for the next five weeks. It was thought quite possible, however, that the committee's 11 voting members would decide to defer any rate cuts until they see what happened to inflation last month as measured by the broader Consumer Price Index. Unlike the producer index, the consumer index includes services and imported goods.
The general expectation is that the rise in consumer prices approached 1 percent last month, with the underlying rate climbing about half as much as the overall index.
Although there is wide agreement that factors like drought and the risk of war do distort price data, there is considerable resistance among economists to the notion of entirely disregarding these special factors when assessing inflation risks.
The soaring price of oil, for example, has a powerful effect on sentiment and forces people to react "just as though it's permanent," contended Paul W. Boltz, vice president and financial economist at T. Rowe Price Associates in Baltimore. Even though the higher prices of such goods may be the result of special or "artificial" factors, consumers do pay those higher prices, adding to pressure to try to recover this lost purchasing power through higher wages.
On Tuesday, the department reported that hourly compensation increased at a 4.4 percent annual rate in the third quarter, down from a 5.4 percent rate of increase in the second quarter, an indication that worrisome wage pressures are not imminent.
Today's report showed that the finished-goods index rose two-tenths of 1 percent when only energy -- rather than energy and food -- was excluded. The energy component, which accounts for 9.2 percent of the index, climbed 8 percent in October after jumping 13.8 percent in September and 9.5 percent in August.
The two other principal indexes of producer prices, those covering goods at the intermediate and crude stages of production, were also driven sharply higher last month by energy.
Intermediate goods rose 1.5 percent, but just four-tenths of 1 percent without energy; crude goods rose 8.7 percent, but two-tenths of 1 percent without energy. Excluding both food and energy, intermediate goods rose moderately while crude goods fell considerably, the department said.
In the production of, say, clothing, raw cotton would be considered a crude material, a bolt of cloth an intermediate material and a suit or dress the finished goods.
All three stages have posted overall increases of more than 1 percent for each of the last three months.
Among finished goods, the 8 percent rise for gasoline and 15 percent rise for heating oil was considerably less than in August and September, but food rose nine-tenths of 1 percent after falling by that amount in September. Higher prices were posted for beef and veal, pork, eggs, and fresh and dried vegetables; prices fell for processed chickens, roasted coffee, fish, dairy products and shortening and cooking oils.
Prices of passenger cars fell 2.7 percent, but without seasonal adjustment they rose 6.2 percent.
Among intermediate goods, where energy components climbed 8.4 percent, nondurable manufacturing materials, like paints and fabrics, rose 1.3 percent, while prices of items for making durables were unchanged.
In crude goods, prices turned up for food and feeds after falling for two straight months, but basic industrial materials, like copper scrap and iron and steel scrap, fell far more than in September. Energy goods soared 18.7 percent last month after a 12.4 percent rise in September and a 25.5 percent rise in August.

Buildup in Gulf Seen as a Signal On Use of Force

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSENTHAL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 9

 BODY:
President Bush ordered more troops to the Persian Gulf because the threat of economic strangulation is not swaying President Saddam Hussein of Iraq and he did not want to wait a year or more for sanctions to cripple the Iraqi economy, a senior Administration official said today.
The official, who insisted on not being identified, suggested that Mr. Bush wanted to bring the crisis to a turning point by the spring, either by giving Mr. Hussein the final push he needs to leave Kuwait on his own and adhere to United Nations Security Council resolutions, or by putting the United States and its allies in position to drive him out if necessary. 
 Mr. Bush has not given up on sanctions, the official said, or made a final decision to go to war. But he said: "We're not prepared to give this guy unlimited time, whoever's side time is on. Clearly, sanctions are not at the point where he is seriously constrained."
 
A Strong Signal to Hussein
 The United States policy could result in a decision by Mr. Hussein to test whether Washington is bluffing and force the United States to a critical decision about whether to attack Iraq and if so, on what scale. Officials briefing reporters did not address the question of whether it was possible that the United States might back down if there was no change in the situation in coming months.
One official said not one of the diplomatic missions to Iraq undertaken so far by representatives of Egypt, Syria, the Soviet Union and other countries had produced any evidence that the sanctions were having a psychological effect on Mr. Hussein.
"There's no one who has come back with any -- any -- sense that Saddam Hussein is wavering, changing his mind or anything like that, that there's any hope in that regard," he said. "Some want to keep trying and say we haven't exhausted all the possibilities, but even those desperately wanting to find some avenue like that have not said they've found any light in Saddam Hussein."
Mr. Bush's decision to send more troops to the Persian Gulf was thus intended to send Mr. Hussein a strong signal that the United States was not only prepared to carry out its threat of using force if needed but also was capable of inflicting devastating damage on Mr. Hussein's forces.
"One of the things that we want to do is convince him that we are in fact serious," the official said.
 
Consultation With Congress
 He added: "We still hope he will come to his senses. We hope that this will be an additional influence. I'm not prepared to take the next step and say we are going to launch an attack on such and such a day. That's the ultimatum, and we haven't come to that."
Congressional reaction to Mr. Bush's announcement on Thursday was muted. But the increased deployment did draw quick criticism from at least one member of Mr. Bush's party.
"While the President has taken great pains to consult with the Soviets, the Syrians, the Egyptians, the Saudis, the French, the Germans, the British and with the many others at the United Nations, his Administration has failed to adequately consult with the American Congress," said Representative William S. Broomfield of Michigan, the senior Republican on the House Foreign Affairs Committee.
Mr. Broomfield, who is generally reluctant to criticize a Republican President on matters of foreign policy, added in a written statement: "The President's decision to add more American troops to the force in the gulf may have been the right thing to do military and diplomatically, but his failure to consult broadly with Congress could eventually serve to undermine his policy."
 
Pressure to End Crisis
 Thomas S. Foley, Speaker of the House, said Mr. Bush had done a better job of consulting with Congress than virtually all of his recent predecessors but quickly added that lawmakers had not been informed of the additional deployments in advance.
"The recent troop increases were not the product of consultation," he said.
Although Administration officials professed surprise at suggestions that Mr. Bush had not adequately explained his gulf policy, the White House made senior officials available to reporters to discuss the new deployment orders. Mr. Bush also scheduled a meeting for Wednesday with Congressional leaders from both parties and the heads of committees dealing with national-security issues.
The senior official indicated that Mr. Bush had come under pressure to speed the conclusion to the gulf crisis because of Mr. Hussein's troop buildup, his attempts to divide the coalition ranged against him and the increasing difficulty of keeping large numbers of troops in the desert without actually using them.
 
Strained U.S. Embassy
 The United States is under additional pressure to force Mr. Hussein out of Kuwait quickly because the besieged American Embassy in Kuwait is running out of food. It may not be able to hold out even as long as it takes to get the reinforcements to the gulf, the official said.
Meanwhile, he said, Mr. Hussein is "still playing games and some of them with some skill to try to divide the coalition, create trouble and so on and so forth, as if time is on his side."
The Muslim holy period of Ramadan in March and the pilgrimage to Mecca in June, known as the Haj, are likely to increase the political problem that the presence of American troops has already created in Saudi Arabia, the official said.
 
Religious Aspect a Factor
 Those events "tend to underscore the religious aspect of it and one of Saddam Hussein's themes of course is that the Saudis are defiling the Holy Land" by allowing American and other Western forces onto their territory, the official said.
"I wouldn't say there is any indication that Saddam's themes are necessarily working," he said, "either that this is a U.S.-Israeli plot against the Arabs or that the Saudis and their Egyptian colleagues are desecrating Muslim shrines. But they are factors one has to take into account."
The official said, "All of these things indicate that waiting to starve him out may not be the way to go."
 
Brandt and Hostages Arrive
FRANKFURT, Nov. 9 (AP) -- Former West German Chancellor Willy Brandt arrived here from Baghdad today with at least 174 Westerners whose freedom he had sought in talks with President Hussein.
The former hostages, detained since Iraq overran Kuwait on Aug. 2, included three Americans, one of whom had been shot in the arm by Iraqi troops in Kuwait on Sept. 5.
The wounded man, Miles Hoffman, 33 years old, of Columbus, Ga., had been working for the Kuwaiti Government. The other Americans were identified as Don and Brenda Swanke of Westlake Village, Calif. All three had been held at strategic sites as "human shields" to deter attack by United States-led multinational forces stationed in the gulf.

HEADLINE: Electronics Business Longing for a New Hit

BYLINE: By EBEN SHAPIRO

 BODY:
For the second consecutive year, electronics retailers see little hope for a bright Christmas. With no new hit products to lure consumers and competition growing from Sears and Montgomery Ward, a fresh wave of store closings is expected by early next year, industry executives and analysts say.
Store executives say they do have a few strong-selling products, some surprisingly so, given consumers' wariness about a recession. 
 The camcorder is one. As these video cameras continue to shrink, their sales continue to grow. Compact disk players and cellular phones are also selling well. While prices are falling on these items, they remain at the higher end of the cost spectrum.
In fact, camcorders are contradicting a longstanding truism of the consumer electronics business, which says that a product must cost less than $500 to have mass-market potential. Consumers are buying large numbers of camcorders at nearly $1,000 each.
Now, if someone decides a product is a necessity, "price does not seem to be an object," said Marvin M. Stern, vice president for home appliances and entertainment at Sears, Roebuck & Company.
But those are the exceptions and they are coming up short against several factors that are tightening the squeeze on retailers. "The industry is going to go through a couple of very lean years," said Barry Bryant, an analyst with Prudential-Bache Securities.
 
 Setbacks for Regional Chains
 Several regional chains, like Crazy Eddie and the Federated Group Inc., have filed for bankruptcy, been sold in pieces or gone out of business in the last year or so. They were unable to hold on now that more than two-thirds of the nation's households have videocassette recorders and microwave ovens.
The stepped-up competition comes at an especially bad time for retailers like Highland Superstores Inc. and Fretter Inc. These mid-sized chains are once again entering the crucial holiday selling season of the notoriously hit-driven electronics business with no hits to drive up badly needed sales.
While the prospect of competing against Sears may not strike terror in the hearts of many retailers these days, the giant retailer has been able to take advantage of its size in selling color televisions, portable stereos and VCR's.
Sears's crosstown rival, Montgomery Ward & Company, has also had considerable success with its Electric Avenue format, a glitzy island of neon and stereo equipment plunked down inside regular Ward's.
After years of explosive gains fueled first by VCR sales and then microwave ovens, growth in the consumer electronics field has flattened to around 2 percent a year. Last year, sales were $32.3 billion, according to the Electronic Industries Association in Washington, compared with $30.8 billion the year before.
Even the industry powerhouse, Circuit City Stores Inc., is feeling the pinch. On Tuesday, when the Richmond company reported a 7 percent drop in comparable-store sales for October, the stock fell to a 52-week low of $10.375. The shares closed yesterday at $10.875, up 87.5 cents.
 
 Clout in Retailing
 Camcorders show how Sears has gained clout in electronics retailing.
Last year, Lee Schoenfeld, marketing vice president for the Best Buy Company, a Midwestern chain based in Minneapolis, received some disturbing information. "Believe it or not, we are getting beat by Sears" in the camcorder business, Mr. Schoenfeld said he had been told by an employee. Sears was heavily promoting its $1,000 private-label LXI brand.
"It was an example of where they were able to use their buying power to have a better price," Mr. Schoenfeld said. "Last year they basically drove the camcorder business." Best Buy estimates that Sears now controls about 20 percent of the camcorder market, a number Sears does not dispute.
Sears began shifting to its Brand Central department, selling name- brand and private-label consumer electronics, in August 1988, but just recently completed installing the section in all its stores. The company does not give separate sales figures for that department, but said that a $2 billion number cited in a trade magazine, HFD, was in the ballpark.
 
 Power of Consumer Fear
 "They've made a very competitive market that much more competitive," Martin Brochstein, senior editor of Television Digest, another trade magazine, said of the emergence of Sears and Ward's.
Sears's selection is usually more limited and its prices tend to be higher than those at the speciality stores. But George Rosenbaum, president of Leo J. Shapiro & Associates Inc., a Chicago market research firm, said that Sears's traditional strengths, the service system, the credit program and the willingness of the company to stick by what its sells to keep long-term customers, help neutralize the price and selection issues.
"Winning against the superstores becomes symbolically a very important step forward in the renaissance of Sears," Mr. Rosenbaum said.
Right now the industry's most formidable foe is consumer fear about the weakening economy.
G. Lee Thompson, the chairman and chief executive of the Smith Corona Corporation, said the weakening economy would quicken the rate of consolidation in the industry. "It is survival of the fittest," he said. "Anytime there are difficult economic times, the weaker players get weeded out."
Mr. Bryant of Prudential-Bache said that fierce price cutting had made margins for electronics products among the lowest in the industry, leaving no room for missteps in a recession.
But perhaps the industry's biggest problem is the lack of any hot new products.
Retailers are gazing wistfully at the horizon, awaiting some major new category, like high-definition television, or HDTV, that will provide a fresh spurt of growth. Mr. Bryant of Prudential-Bache calls HDTV "the light at the end of the tunnel." Digital audio tape players, which are now available, also hold some promise.
The mood at the 47th Street Photo store a few blocks off Manhattan's Times Square is typical. "There's no silver bullet coming down the pike," said Mark Gross, a salesman at the bustling retailer. "That's been the problem in this industry for the past couple of years," he said. He bemoans the lack of a VCR-type hit, saying, "That's what got the electronics industry through the last recession."
VCR's were introduced a decade ago, and Mr. Gross, who was a rabbi in the early 1980's, said that the desire to have one was so great that the subject came up in counseling sessions.
"The choice at that time was having a child or getting a VCR," he joked.
For now, replacement sales are the chief source of revenue for retailers. Consider the television set. Although more than 98 percent of households in the country own a color or black and white set, the industry continues to sell more than 20 million new ones a year.
 
 A Zero-Sum Game
 Still, industry officials eagerly await the next technological breakthrough. Replacement sales are essentially a zero-sum game, while VCR's and microwaves were entirely new categories.
"When a new electronic product like the VCR comes along, you have the pie enlarging very quickly," said Mr. Rosenbaum of Leo J. Shapiro & Associates. He added that a hot product could obscure a lot of mistakes by retailers. It forgives overexpansion, he said, and "it forgives even retailers who are mediocre."
The next few months are not likely to be so forgiving. Mr. Stern of Sears said, "There are too many stores and not enough customers."

GRAPHIC: Photo: Stores like this Sears Brand Central outlet at the Cross County Square mall in Yonkers, which had very few customers yesterday afternoon, are part of the growing competition facing electronic specialty stores. But the outlook for the Christmas selling season seems disappointing for the retailing giants as well as for the smaller chains.

HEADLINE: Every Other 14-Year-Old, Armed

 BODY:
Teen-agers in New York City have never had so many guns with so much killing power. Informed estimates of the number of illegal guns on the street run into the hundreds of thousands. "If you're asking me if every 14-year-old has a gun," a police officer recently told The Times, "the answer is no. Does every other 14-year-old have a gun? The answer is yes."
These are no longer cheap "Saturday night specials" but powerful 9-millimeter semiautomatics, machine pistols or military assault rifles worth hundreds of dollars affordable with drug money. 
 Recent articles in The Times documented official concern about the alarming "new gun culture" among New York City teen-agers. With easy access to firearms, adolescents all too predictably adopt them as status symbols and toys. Once in hand, the guns, increasingly, are used. Last year 66 percent of homicides were committed with firearms, compared with 58 percent in 1980 and only 19 percent in 1960.
Now the challenge is to limit the access to guns in the face of a powerful black market and continuing political neglect. It will not be easy. New York City has some of the toughest gun control laws in the country. But they are thwarted by illegal traffickers who earn hefty markups on weapons imported from states with lax rules. The popular Mac-10, for example, which retails for $500 elsewhere, may sell for three times as much in New York City.
Given enough political determination, this deadly market can be disrupted. Unlike the drug products that originate in Andean mountains or Asian poppy fields, beyond easy reach of American law, guns are made and distributed by legitimate American businesses fully subject to U.S. Government regulation. Illicit gun trafficking would be severely inhibited by laws that institute rigorous procedures for monitoring of gun shipments and sales, and ban civilian purchases of military weapons altogether.
Yet Congress cravenly ducks the issue. The gun lobby furiously resists any serious effort to keep guns out of young criminals' hands, apparently to protect the industry's interest in such sales. After a session marked by increasing debate over reasonable new gun laws -- supported by large popular majorities -- the House adjourned without even bringing them to a vote.
That leaves local officials to their own devices, and New York's Police Commissioner, Lee Brown, is off to a thoughtful if limited start. Last summer he formed a police task force to work with Federal agents against gun traffickers. The group has already made 28 arrests. Now he supplements that effort with a new crackdown on New Yorkers who hold Federal gun dealer licenses for dubious purposes.
Such licenses, relatively easy for individuals to obtain from Washington, allow receipt of bulk purchases from gun makers and other exemptions from Federal limits. The police count more than 1,000 such Federal licenses issued to New York City residents, but only 32 dealers have also obtained the license required by the city to sell handguns.
Mr. Brown plans aggressive measures to determine whether the remaining "dealers" are using their Federal licenses to obtain guns that they then dispense illegally in the city. Citing a little used state law, he has also instructed some 3,000 cargo carriers to hold gun shipments headed for city addresses while police verify whether the recipients are licensed to possess guns.
Those are laudable steps, but are they enough to quench so thriving a black market? Much will depend on whether the police can muster sufficient resources to make the innovative strategies work. Even in a time of severe budgetary stringencies, the department has little choice but to try.

HEADLINE: Taiwan: Too Big to Ignore

 BODY:
Taiwan is now one of Asia's most powerful industrial and trading economies. It is America's sixth-largest trading partner, doing more business with this country than France or Saudi Arabia and twice as much as mainland China. Taiwan has become a major global investor; its companies now buy out American businesses.
Yet in the eyes of official Washington, and of most other governments, Taipei scarcely exists. 
 When Washington belatedly recognized the People's Republic 12 years ago, it accepted the proposition then put forth by both Beijing and Taipei that there could be only one China. But in reality, there remain two Chinas. America's traditional one-China policy is ripe for critical review.
The one-China fiction grows increasingly hard to justify as Taiwan deepens its economic relations with the outside world and China turns its back on market reforms. After last year's bloodbath in Tiananmen Square, no one imagines an easy fusion of the two Chinese states any time soon.
Taipei's application to rejoin the capitalist world's main trade organization, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, has already set off a debate within the Bush Administration. Carla Hills, the Trade Representative, supports Taipei's bid. But the State Department, reluctant to upset Beijing and perhaps endanger its cooperation against Iraq, resists.
Taiwan was a founding member of the Trade Agreement in 1947 but was forced out in 1971 when the People's Republic assumed China's seat in the United Nations. Its return would automatically subject Taiwanese trade to the world's agreed trading ground rules. That can also be done, as now, by a network of bilateral agreements.
Ultimately, GATT membership is symbolic and political. But it is just for symbolic and political reasons that the U.S. should now look with favor on Taiwan's readmission. There is no doubt about Taiwan's commitment to a market economy, a standard condition for GATT membership. And, unlike mainland China, Taiwan is now committed to democracy.
There are obvious problems. Beijing insists on subordinating Taiwan's application to its own membership bid. But that may not prove insuperable. Both Chinas now participate in the Asian Development Bank, with Taiwan accepting the designation "Taipei, China." That formula honors the fiction of one China while acknowledging the reality of two regimes. Taipei would re-enter GATT as the "Customs Territory of Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen and Matsu."
Washington is not obliged to humor Beijing's desire to deny the reality of two Chinas. Especially on economic matters, the U.S. holds far more cards than the People's Republic, and can afford to put American interests first. Those interests are served by maintaining normal diplomatic and economic relations with mainland China. But they are also served by dealing with the reality of Taipei.

HEADLINE: International Monetary Fund Helps Preserve the Environment

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Readers alarmed by decimation of tropical rain forests should not be deluded by full-page advertisements of the Rainforest Action Network in your newspaper and others charging that the International Monetary Fund is one of the "world's leading architects of environmental destruction" (Oct. 15). I will reply briefly -- if only to minimize the felling of trees for newsprint.
The I.M.F. is composed of 154 member countries and is the world's central monetary institution. It was created 45 years ago for the promotion of international trade and economic growth by helping countries to stabilize their currencies, battle inflation and build sound economies. More than 60 countries are receiving or negotiating I.M.F. assistance. Some 30 are African nations seeking to reverse a tragic fall in per capita income over the last two decades; in Latin America, many countries now have a chance to grow out of debt, and remarkable progress is being made in Eastern Europe, all in cooperation with the I.M.F.
The I.M.F. also assists its members to improve their economic efficiency. By helping countries move from state-run to market systems and reduce their foreign debt to sustainable levels, it contributes to laying the foundation for long-term sustainable growth. It is such growth that will eventually prevail against poverty and in some ways help the environment, too. The fight against poverty is the only way to avoid a situation where people are driven to destroy irreplaceable environmental assets, such as rain forests. The I.M.F. coordinates advice and support with other international agencies with environmental concerns and expertise.
Economic change and transformation are not costless. The I.M.F. encourages countries to develop social safety nets so that the more vulnerable segments of the population can, to the extent possible, be protected against the inescapable hardship of economic adjustment.
The advertisement and solicitation were inaccurate in suggesting that I.M.F.-supported programs are financed solely by United States taxpayers. The United States and 153 other members own shares in this cooperative institution; these pooled resources are used to extend credit and technical assistance to member countries in need. By making a contribution to the financial resources of the I.M.F., each country -- including the United States -- also establishes a right to draw on the institution, which it can exercise when a need arises.
An increase of the I.M.F.'s capital base is indispensable to enable it to face the unexpected needs of its members, such as those brought on by the Persian Gulf crisis. The best prospect for preserving the environment worldwide is to be found in encouraging and assisting countries to develop their economic potential, not by attacking as convenient targets agencies like the I.M.F. and the World Bank that are dedicated to that goal.

HEADLINE: Woman With a Shovel Gets Ready to Govern

BYLINE: By JASON DePARLE

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 9

 BODY:
For months it's been shovels: shovel pins on her lapel, shovels in her hands, shovels in campaign speeches that said a mere broom wouldn't be enough to clean up City Hall. Now the question is whether Sharon Pratt Dixon, Washington's Mayor-elect, can turn her winning metaphor into a workable government.
The corks from the victory-night champagne bottles had barely stopped popping when Ms. Dixon began work on that formidable task. 
 She met with John Wilson, the new chairman of the City Council, to discuss ways of cutting a 1991 deficit projected at $200 million. She met with Eleanor Holmes Norton, the District's new delegate to Congress, and announced a strategy for seeking more Federal funds.
A 46-year-old political newcomer, Ms. Dixon also gave the first hints of her taste in government aides, appointing a 27-member transition team headed by Vernon Jordan, a corporate lawyer who is a member in good standing of the Washington establishment.
 
Declawing Her Predecessor
 At the same time, she continued battling her predecessor, Mayor Marion S. Barry Jr., whom she had blamed for many of the city's problems. Pledging to make good on her promise to clean house, Ms. Dixon asked for the resignation of all 170 of his political appointees, fearing that otherwise Mr. Barry would grant them Civil Service protection to prevent their dismissal when she takes office in January.
She also called on the City Council to pass a law that would curtail Mr. Barry's ability to dispense last-minute favors by awarding contracts or giving his aides raises or promotions.
Mr. Barry said Ms. Dixon's requests were unnecessary because he had no plans for such machinations in the last two months of his administration. But she was unwilling to take him at his word. "I wouldn't have urged emergency legislation if I didn't think it was at least a potential problem," she said at a news conference.
The week's problems may be only a taste of things to come, as Ms. Dixon takes command of a city with empty pockets, a flabby midsection, surging needs and a tattered national reputation.
She has promised to cut a government work force that grew 25 percent in Mr. Barry's 12 years in office, even as the population shrank. She has also promised compassion. Despite the bureaucracy's enormous growth, the District has enormous unmet needs.
 
Dropouts, Murders and Blight
 It has the highest infant mortality rate of any city in the country. Its public housing stock includes 2,500 boarded-up units. Its ambulances are known for getting lost while answering emergency calls.
Its schools are near the top in dropout rates and close to the bottom in scores on the Scholastic Aptitude Test. Its murder rate has helped keep tabloid television in business.
Like other mayors, Ms. Dixon will have to conduct her fiscal balancing act during an economic slump that brings revenue down while accelerating need. But unlike other mayors, she will also have to contend with a Congress that has control over her budget and what many here regard as a penchant for micromanagement.
Ms. Dixon faces these challenges with more than mere talk of shovels. On Tuesday, in her first run for elective office, she captured 86 percent of the vote, a record for a mayoral election in Washington, and carried all 140 precincts. That left little question about her mandate.
As the first black woman to head the government of a major city, she comes into office with immediate national stature. And she will put it to work in a city that completed its repudiation of the previous era by handing Mr. Barry, who has been convicted of drug possession, a pink slip rather than the City Council seat he sought.
Ms. Dixon also carries into office a newcomer status that is a mixture of insurgency and establishment. She was the first candidate in the mayor's race, the first to call for Mr. Barry's resignation, and a clear underdog. More than any other candidate, she stood for change.
 
Outside, but Hardly Unknown
 But she was not unknown. A lawyer who was most recently a vice president of the Potomac Electric Power Company, she served as campaign manager for Patricia Roberts Harris, a former Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, in an unsuccessful 1982 campaign against Mr. Barry. And she has served as treasurer of the Democratic National Committee.
"She sort of invented herself as an outsider, and the public bought it," said Mark Plotkin, a political commentator on WAMU-FM, a public radio station.
While her campaign message was a blunt "clean house," it has often been unclear what type of people or programs she plans when the renovation is through. One clue was this week's appointment of Mr. Jordan, a former head of the National Urban League.
"I wasn't against the establishment itself," she said at a news conference Thursday when asked about Mr. Jordan's appointment. "I felt it needed a new thrust."
She said the transition team would try "to tap into dimensions of this town that have never been tapped into." Many of her campaign aides are young and new to city politics.
Having won over the public, Ms. Dixon and her aides must now win the city's politicians and bureaucrats.
She set to work on the first task the day after the election by meeting with the new chairman of the City Council. Throughout the campaign, Mr. Wilson, a longtime Councilman who was neutral in the mayoral race, said he envisioned new influence for the body. And as head of both the Council and the Revenue and Finance Committee, he will wield much of that influence.
Mr. Wilson has said he favors a tax increase. Ms. Dixon has said she does not.
The City Council with which she will deal also includes two of her defeated rivals in the mayoral race.
As a newcomer to the District government, Ms. Dixon will need to motivate the bureaucracy she campaigned against. Her talents in this regard are unknown. While she is often called smart and determined, she has not worked in government and has never run a large organization.
On her most specific pledge -- "to cut 2,000 mid-management-level paper pushers" -- she can expect a fight. Civil Service protections make cutbacks tough.
But so, the recent evidence suggests, is Ms. Dixon.

HEADLINE: Why Keep Yugoslavia One Country?

BYLINE: By Jeri Laber and Kenneth Anderson; Jeri Laber is executive director of Helsinki Watch; Kenneth Anderson, a lawyer, is a member.

 BODY:
Polat, a remote village in Yugoslavia's troubled Kosovo province, is too small to appear on our map. Until the ghastly events of Sept. 13, its name was virtually unknown. We went to Polat in early October to investigate reports of violence by the nationalist Serbian government against ethnic Albanians. We returned with serious doubts about whether the U.S. Government should continue to bolster the national unity of Yugoslavia.
A brilliant autumn sun lit the dry, brown cornfields and tree-covered hills of Polat, but the village was in mourning. Its residents -- several hundred ethnic Albanians living at subsistence level -- described how, in the predawn hours of Sept. 13, they had awakened to the barking of their dogs, looked out and saw Serbian government tanks in their small courtyards. 
 Without warning, soldiers and police began firing automatic weapons, shattering windows and stuccoed walls. Besim Latifi, a 22-year-old law student who had come home to help with the harvest, opened his door and was met with a volley of bullets that killed him on the spot.
No one saw what happened to Skender Munolli, 34, whose battered corpse was released to his family a few days later with one bullet in the hip. According to their families, neither young man had had any previous trouble with the police. In addition to the two killings, more than 30 men and women from Polat were beaten and taken off to a jail, where they were tortured for about 24 hours; one young man was forced to lick his own blood from the floor.
Kosovo is a province within Serbia, the largest of Yugoslavia's six fractious republics. Kosovo's population -- more than 90 percent ethnic Albanian -- is united in a predominantly nonviolent struggle to become independent. In July, after the Kosovo Assembly defiantly declared its independence, the Serbian government suspended Kosovo's parliament and government; at least 10 members of the assembly have been arrested or are being sought.
Slobodan Milosevic, the Serbian Socialist (formerly Communist) Party's demagogic leader, has said that Serbia will pay any price to maintain control of Kosovo, the birthplace of Serbian culture. He is engaged in a calculated policy of colonization that includes relocating Serbians to Kosovo.
An estimated 30,000 Albanians have been removed from their jobs in Kosovo. Several hundred Albanian doctors and medical workers were fired summarily; some were taken away in handcuffs from the hospital, even out of the operating rooms. The Albanian-language press and radio have been abolished. In schools, Albanians are segregated from Serbs.
Kosovo's capital, Pristina, is an occupied territory, with military checkpoints everywhere. Houses are searched without notice, and people are arrested arbitrarily. In the past year and a half, more than 60 Albanians were killed by police. "We live under glass," an unemployed Albanian professor told us. "I don't know what it is like to laugh. How long can I tell my children to be patient?"
Kosovo is not the only troubled area within Yugoslavia. We visited villages in the Croatian Republic where the tension is equally high; an armed minority composed of Serbs has declared autonomy within Croatia. Franko Tudjman, the nationalist President of Croatia, has said that his government will "invite our entire people to take to arms" if Croatian sovereignty is threatened.
The Slovenian Republic's government, which has also declared its sovereignty, has already taken control of its own defense forces in direct defiance of the central government. Borislav Jovic, head of the Yugoslav government, recently acknowledged that civil war was looming on the horizon.
Yugoslavia was long the darling of the U.S. State Department. A Communist country independent of Moscow, it was our Communist country as distinct from theirs. Seen as a buffer straddling the East-West divide, it has received most-favored-nation status and has been exempted from any serious scrutiny of its many human rights abuses. But the revolution against Communism that swept through Eastern Europe left an ideological vacuum in regions that are now veering away from a center that cannot hold.
The U.S. Government cannot stop that process, even if it leads to inflaming old border disputes between Yugoslavia's nation-states and its larger neighbors. Yet we continue to give economic support to a federal Government in Belgrade that is apparently too weak to speak out or act against those who are committing human rights abuses.
Why not acknowledge the Government's impotence and offer aid to those republics that will protect the rights of all their citizens? We might be able to help them in a peaceful evolution to democracy.
There is no moral law that commits us to honor the national unity of Yugoslavia. But there are laws, both moral and statutory, that commit us to deny aid to governments that oppress.

HEADLINE: The Two Faces of Southern Populism

BYLINE: By Dan T. Carter; Dan T. Carter, a professor of history at Emory University, is a fellow at the National Humanities Center.

DATELINE: DURHAM , N.C.

 BODY:
George Wallace, that Southern ghost of elections past, still haunts us as we enter the 1990's.
If Guy Hunt's re-election campaign as Governor of Alabama was a kinder and gentler version of the politics of race, Jesse Helms's senatorial campaign in North Carolina offered a chilling reminder that the old-time religion of "Nigger! Nigger! Nigger!" can still bring out the frightened faithful. Both victories vindicate those Republican strategists who have always wanted to exploit the racial fears so skillfully aroused by Mr. Wallace in his Presidential campaigns of the 1960's and 70's. 
 It is a strategy that seems particularly suited for our increasingly subliterate television culture. In that world in which each new day begins afresh -- without past, without future -- 30-second appeals to glandular reflexes ("quotas," "parasitic underclass") are infinitely more accessible than complex discussions of race relations or economic exploitation. The current economic downturn makes such squalid appeals to scapegoating even more effective.
What we should not forget is that this is neither something new nor the last word, but the latest chapter in a century-old struggle between two quite different strands of Southern populism.
Mr. Wallace began his career in 1946 as a down-home social democrat with little enthusiasm for race-baiting. To be sure, when hebecame the high priest of racial segregation in the early 1960's, he brought to Alabama a level of vindictiveness that left wounds still unhealed. And his Presidential campaigns gave voice to some of the darkest fears and hatreds in American society.
But when the number of black voters in his state passed the 300,000 mark in the early 1970's, the Alabama Governor reversed direction and embraced black voters and politicians. Political opportunism is not an edifying spectacle. Compared with the unwavering racism of Mr. Helms, it has its charms.
In some ways, George Wallace was simply returning to his political roots, as one of the proteges of a Southern populist who spent his career fighting for, rather than against, civil rights: James E. (Big Jim) Folsom.
Through two terms as Governor of Alabama and 40 years of campaigning, Folsom evolved his political catechism: governmental laissez-faire inevitably allowed the powerful to prey upon the weak; adequate welfare programs were the fundamental obligation of a democracy; women were entitled to full equality; the state of Alabama should guarantee black citizens equal justice, equal opportunity and complete access to the ballot box; there were no problems that couldn't be solved by a "good strong purgative of pure unadulterated democracy."
In the end, Folsom's personal failings (too much whisky, too many women, too few honest friends) were as conspicuous as his 6-foot 8-inch frame and his size 16 shoes. His challenge to Mr. Wallace collapsed in the 1962 governor's race when he appeared on statewide television too drunk to recognize his own children. When he ran for governor against Mr. Wallace in 1974, he got less than 5 percent of the vote.
And now, as the economy falters and the bills for Ronald Reagan's fantasies come due, the voices James Folsom fought are returning to join the David Dukes. The politics of victimization are over, we are told. Now black Americans can once more take their historical place as the scapegoats of a troubled society.
Folsom had seen it all before. The "Ku-Kluxers, the race-baiters, and some of the selfish interest groups" would always be present, he warned in 1949. They would be "spreading their filth, their lies, their old and ancient hatreds . . . trying to boil up hatred by the poor white people against the Negroes . . . trying to keep the poor white from progressing by keeping the Negro tied in shackles."
Still, I take heart from the only conversation I ever had with James Folsom. He was nearly blind and occasionally confused as we sat and talked in a truck-stop restaurant outside Cullman, Ala. But he retained an almost childlike faith in the same voters who had rejected him. The working people of this country would eventually see through this "blasphemous smoke screen" of racial hatred, hepredicted in our talk. And they would understand that the promise of this nation lay in the challenge of guaranteeing "equal justice, equal opportunity and equal freedom for every man, woman and child."
That's a far cry from the "populism" of Jesse Helms.

AMERICA IN 1857
A Nation on the Brink.
By Kenneth M. Stampp.
Illustrated. 388 pp. New York:
Oxford University Press. $29.95. 
 KENNETH M. STAMPP is by common acclaim the dean of historians of the Civil War era, and the long and honorable list of his works more than justifies the title; but not since "The Era of Reconstruction" (1965) has he used the narrative form. Now that it is becoming so academically fashionable, he has perhaps decided to show the young how an old master can handle it; and the result is a triumph of the historian's craft. The argument underlying this chronicle of one year could not be stated more modestly, but almost every detail contributes to it; and the cunning structure of the narrative, which amounts to a carefully calculated arrangement of details, will compel readers to discover Mr. Stampp's thesis for themselves and make it their own.
The argument, to be sure, is neither new nor obscure. Kansas in 1857 was a territory ready to become a state. The urgent question was, should it be admitted to the Union with the proslavery, ill-drafted constitution that an unrepresentative handful of extremists had cobbled together at Lecompton, Kan., late in the year? President James Buchanan, by insisting on the Lecompton constitution, split his party and opened the way to disaster. In Mr. Stampp's opinion, his mishandling of the Kansas crisis was the fatal step that made disruption of the Union, and therefore civil war, all but inescapable. But each generation must learn the ancient truths for itself. It need only be added that Mr. Stampp's style is as clear and plain as his knowledge is great. "America in 1857" is a book from which even scholars can learn, which nonhistorians can enjoy, and which Civil War buffs will certainly relish. It may even please unreconstructed rebels, for it shows, as definitely as these things can ever be established, that the great blunder over the Lecompton constitution was Buchanan's own work, not that of his Southern friends and colleagues.
If the book has a weakness, it is that it starts a little too quietly. This is not a usual fault in books about the coming of the Civil War. Mr. Stampp's taste is perhaps a little too good for his own interest. A touch of the drum and the trumpet, or at least some lively pages about the election of 1856, might have hooked readers more certainly than the somewhat humdrum account of politics and society in early 1857 with which the volume opens.
So it becomes a reviewer's duty to advise all such readers to persevere. They will be rewarded by plenty of excitement from the day of Buchanan's inauguration onward, and they will find that, in retrospect, even the opening chapters have importance. For one of Mr. Stampp's themes is that in the spring of 1857 the Republic's prospects were blooming. Even the Dred Scott decision, made that year, was not sufficient to revive the passionate disputes of 1856, and although there was a financial crash in the autumn, we now know, if the people of the time did not, that the economy was to make a rapid recovery. In short, Buchanan had to work really hard to wreck things.
If, as is only fair, we judge him by the foreseeable consequences of his actions, he must without question be rated the worst American President, his only competitor being Andrew Johnson, whose faults of character were very similar. The preceding Administration of Franklin Pierce had belatedly put an end to violence in "bleeding Kansas"; the Democratic Party had pledged itself to free elections in the territory; the South was by no means united in resistance to that pledge because it was so evident Kansas was going to be a free-soil state.
Had Buchanan stuck to his own express commitments, the Kansas question would have been laid to rest and the Democratic Party, united, would have been in excellent shape to fight the 1860 election, which everyone knew would be crucial. Mr. Stampp explicitly denies that such an outcome would have ended the great controversy over slavery; he does not pretend to know what would have happened if the Republicans had lost in 1860; but the outcome could hardly have been worse than what, thanks to Buchanan, actually did occur. So the responsibility borne by the 15th President was a heavy one. He chose to recommend the fraudulent Lecompton constitution to Congress, and in so doing broke his word and split his party beyond recovery. Three years later, a Republican victory came, followed by secession and war.
No evidence -- diaries, letters, memoirs -- shows us Buchanan's inner life (presumably he had one). He was a secretive man, and has himself to blame that posterity must interpret him entirely by externals. But the evidence deployed by Mr. Stampp leaves little doubt about Buchanan's motives. His long experience in public life had made him superficially one of the best trained of all Presidents: he had been a senator, Secretary of State, a minister abroad (his successor could only boast of two undistinguished years as a Congressman). In reality his career seems to have taught Buchanan's narrow mind only inapplicable lessons, such as the duty of strict party loyalty in all circumstances, the power of patronage, the importance of Presidential rigidity.
HE had been a follower of Andrew Jackson, and Stephen A. Douglas had to point out to him that "General Jackson is dead"; in any case, no one was ever less like the intuitive, impetuous Jackson than the dully obstinate Buchanan. "General Jackson could be coaxed from his purpose" said Buchanan's Secretary of War, "but . . . Mr. B. could neither be coaxed nor driven." In 40 years of politics, Buchanan did not learn to respect the honest concerns of his opponents, or indeed of anyone but himself and those who agreed with him completely; nor did he ever see that opinions, on their own, are unsafe guides to action. He was a doughface, a Northern man of Southern opinions; and he explicitly blamed the Kansas disturbances not on the handful of proslavery conspirators who began them but on the great mass of antislavery settlers in the territory. So he had no qualms of conscience about trying to override the settlers' democratic rights.
He saw that the crisis in Kansas had to be ended for the sake of the Union; he supposed that the way to do it was by backing the proslavery minority, which was prepared to stick at nothing, whether force or fraud, to get command. All this is contemptible enough; but the amazing thing is that this seasoned politician actually persuaded himself that his course of action was the most prudent and patriotic one. His judgment was as bad as his political morality.
Perhaps they amounted to the same thing. Slavery corrupted the minds of all its supporters. Buchanan's misjudgments were no worse than those that eventually precipitated the South into secession and armed rebellion. What needs explaining is how America came to be saddled with such an incompetent President. Mr. Stampp does not discuss this; perhaps the time has come for another look at David Donald's suggestion that an excess of democracy was at work. At least there was too much party-politics-as-usual. James Buchanan, a man of mediocre character, limited abilities and illiberal opinions -- which, without his noticing, had grown dangerously obsolete -- had by 1856 built up an irresistible claim on his party. He looked like a statesman, but, in Charles Francis Adams's phrase, he was no more than a musty old conservative. His country paid the price.

DEVIL'S NIGHT
And Other True Tales of Detroit.
By Ze'ev Chafets.
240 pp. New York: Random House. $19.95. 
 IN 1967, a race riot ended a Detroit that once looked as if it would go on forever. Seemingly as content as a cat, Detroit was a town of Irish political control and Polish food, of snug brick houses under sprawling maples, a place whose assembly lines guaranteed a good living. In the next two decades it changed from a fairly prosperous city of nearly two million to a poor, nearly all-black town of not quite one million as whites fled to the suburbs, taking their business and investment with them. Whites held the economic reins, blacks assumed political control and a deep animosity began to mark city-suburb relations.
Detroit became the city where blacks really did call the political shots. It also became Murder City, with abandoned neighborhoods, empty stores and an annual three-day Halloween arson explosion that draws firebugs and fire buffs from all over the state.
In "Devil's Night" -- what Detroiters call the night before Halloween -- Ze'ev Chafets, a writer who grew up in one of Detroit's industrial suburbs before emigrating to Israel, has tried to chronicle the city's new life through a Greek chorus of office holders, policemen, rock musicians, drug addicts, mothers, convicted criminals and community workers.
Even for a town that takes church services so seriously that a newspaper once rated sermons like restaurants, this is quite a choir. A Chaldean grocer, standing by his fully loaded gun rack, tells how he locks shoplifters in his basement just beyond reach of his Doberman. An expensively dressed prophet solicits $10 and $20 bills from his poor congregation. A suburban Grosse Pointe matron suggests an innovation in crime coverage. "Why not have a new society page for criminals?" she asks. "If you want to see who shot whom, just turn to Section D." Mayor Coleman Young curses the suburbs and charms his constituents while his counterpart in Hamtramck, a town within the Detroit city limits, sympathizes with him, charging that suburbanflight stripped the city clean. "They even took the ball teams," he notes.
The voices in Mr. Chafets's book rock with a modern assonance befitting Motown. Yet, despite his sketches of a city in sullen confrontation, sort of a Midwestern Middle East, he never quite makes clear that Detroit was destined for hard times no matter who sat in City Hall. Suburban flight was well under way by the mid-50's and, to official outrage, city planners predicted in the mid-60's that business would move north of the city limits.
Even without white flight, Detroit still would have declined from its boom days. The internationalization of the automobile industry choked off the well-paid blue-collar jobs that supported generations of unskilled laborers and propelled their children into the middle class. Detroit has always been a city of industry, not of institutions, and its one-industry status made it particularly vulnerable to boom and bust cycles. The auto companies themselves played a part in the city's current failure to thrive. With the notable exception of the Ford family, the town's corporate leaders came late to civic leadership and did not really get involved until after the riots.
Though Mr. Chafets captures the city's voices, much of what they say is hardly unique to Detroit. Newark has vacant lots. Washington has crack houses. Parts of New York City have infant mortality rates comparable to those in third world countries. And though the author does not mention it, every aging city that is trying to stay vital has a constant tension between money put into downtown and money needed in the neighborhoods.
Still, Mr. Chafets captures the feel of the city; his vignettes are as entertaining as the little grace notes of a fine gospel song. He evokes the nostalgia (he calls it "the white man's malady") for the days when Martha Reeves, Smokey Robinson and Berry Gordy put Motown into the national consciousness, the feel of working on the assembly line in the big Dodge Main or Ford Rouge or Pontiac plants. And he captures the sense of a bellwether black community in charge, on the edge of change, trying to reconstruct a city on the ropes.

 BODY:
EDEN CLOSE, by Anita Shreve. (Signet, $4.95.) When a New York City advertising man goes home to attend a funeral in the upstate farming community where he was raised, he falls back in love with Eden, the girl next door, who was raped and blinded when she was a teen-ager. Last year our reviewer, Carolyn Banks, called this an "evocative and moving novel. . . . Its insights are keen, its language measured and haunting."
ALMOST HUMAN: A Journey Into the World of Baboons, by Shirley C. Strum. (Norton, $12.95.) An anthropologist who spent 15 years studying monkey culture in Kenya, Shirley Strum found that male baboons often use finesse instead of aggression to win the hearts of females. In 1988 our reviewer, Kelly Stewart, said the author is "at her best when she dons her 'baboon spectacles' and describes what she sees. Selecting particular stars from her study troop of 60 animals, the Pumphouse Gang, she recounts anecdotes and mini-sagas from their lives in a socially complex, Machiavellian world." The result is "an entertaining and readable account of what life is like, not only for baboons, but for those who watch them."
THE GROTTO, by Coral Lansbury. (Ivy, $5.95.) Banished from Sicily to the Australian outback, Gwen Harcourt di Marineo, the daughter of archeologists, finds comfort in the ancient myths that preoccupied her as a child. Last year our reviewer, John Mortimer, said, "What gives 'The Grotto' its power is the presence of the old gods, shadowy as an undeveloped photograph, in the back of our minds, however far we may have traveled from the coasts where they were born."
COMPOSING A LIFE, by Mary Catherine Bateson. (Plume, $8.95.) The anthropologist daughter of Margaret Mead and Gregory Bateson tells the story of five extraordinary women, including herself, who have learned to think of life as an improvisational art. "She has an extremely interesting mind and the ability to express herself with extraordinary literary felicity," Jane O'Reilly said here last year.
AFTER YOU'VE GONE, by Alice Adams. (Fawcett Crest, $4.95.) These short stories are about people -- mostly professional women -- adjusting to the loss of lovers and friends. "I was struck by Ms. Adams's facility as a writer," Ron Carlson said here last year. Her stories have "a kind of knowing familiarity with estrangement and the blessings of time."
THE AMBITION AND THE POWER, by John M. Barry. (Penguin, $12.95.) A journalist granted close access to Jim Wright, the Speaker of the House who was forced from office in 1989, argues that Mr. Wright's accusers were less disturbed by his ethical lapses than by his effectivess and power. The book "spurs us to reflect on such things as the debasement of Congress in the 1980's and the periodic transformation of much of the American press into a school of circling, bloodthirsty sharks," Ronnie Dugger said here last year.
LEADER OF THE BAND, by Fay Weldon. (Penguin, $7.95) An astronomer named Starlady Sandra, discoverer of the planet Athena, runs off with a jazz musician named Mad Jack. Last year our reviewer, Robert Ward, said the heroine is "funny, charming and brilliant" though the novel as a whole is more clever than deep. Penguin has also republished Fay Weldon's earlier novel PRAXIS ($7.95), the story of Praxis Duveen, whose experiments with prostitution, incest and finally murder culminate in her anointing as a hero of the women's movement. In 1978 our reviewer, Katha Pollitt, said the book is "often dazzling, pointing up the mad underside of our sexual politics with a venomous accuracy for which wit is too mild a word."
PANATI'S BROWSER'S BOOK OF BEGINNINGS, by Charles Panati. (Houghton Mifflin, $8.95.) Where did ice cream and Islam come from? How about the typewriter, the Torah and the Tootsie Roll? When this quirky 427-page encyclopedia was published in 1984, The Times's Christopher Lehmann-Haupt said he came away from the book "bubbling with new information." "There are still people around who don't know that the Baby Ruth candy bar was named after President Grover Cleveland's daughter or that one of the earliest television broadcasts introduced Kate Smith singing 'When the Moon Comes Over the Mountain.' "
KISSES OF THE ENEMY, by Rodney Hall. (Fireside/ Simon & Schuster, $10.95.) In the not-too-distant future, the C.I.A. plots to turn Australia into a police state. "Shuttling between fantasy and grim realism, Mr. Hall projects a shocking picture of his country's future in a high-flying mixture of farce and fury, paranoia and verbal pyrotechnics," Pearl K. Bell said here in 1988.
SOMOZA FALLING: A Case Study of Washington at Work, by Anthony Lake. (University of Massachusetts, $11.95.) A former State Department official says that the classic conflict between political appointees and career foreign service officers led to the confusion that allowed Nicaragua to fall to the Sandinistas. "Mr. Lake's worthwhile study persuasively shows that it is State Department experts . . . who provide the rational equilibrium between technical experts and the idealistic policy makers," Pamela S. Falk said here last year. " 'Somoza Falling' is worthwhile reading for everyone interested in how the many decisions that become American foreign policy are made."
ONE STEP AHEAD IN CHINA: Guangdong Under Reform, by Ezra F. Vogel. (Harvard University, $12.95.) In 1987, a Harvard professor of international relations spent seven months in southeast China, trying to learn what economic and social reform in this industrial region said about the future of the country. Last year our reviewer, Alan S. Cohen, called the book "necessary reading for all Americans with an interest in China."

Isn't It Rich?

BYLINE: BY WILLIAM SAFIRE

 BODY:
"DON'T TAX YOU, don't tax me," goes the doggerel that former Senator Russell Long used to enjoy quoting. "Tax that feller behind the tree."
After months of peering and pointing, "that feller" turns out to be the rich. Who are they? 
 Some statisticians arbitrarily choose a family income of $80,000 a year as the affluence line (which I have just coined on the analogy of the poverty line), but magazines like Forbes and Fortune prefer making judgments of wealth on the basis of what people have rather than what they earn: $260 million is Forbes's cutoff this year for its "richest 400" list, though most people would apply the word rich to any old multimillionaire.
(There's a word that's fading fast in an era of megabucks. A nuance of its meaning is expressed in this joke: "My friend Sam is a multimillionaire." "No, Sam may be a millionaire, but he's nomultimillionaire. How much does he have in cash?" "Ten thousand dollars." "You're right -- he's a multimillionaire.")
In the Depression years of the early 30's, the rich was a term used by socialist and populist politicians as an epithet, especially in promoting progressive taxation. The first citation of the slogan soak the rich is from James P. Warburg's 1935 book, "Hell Bent for Election," in which President Franklin D. Roosevelt was charged with "being 'clever' when he tried to steal Huey Long's thunder by suddenly coming out with his 'soak the rich' tax message."
The use of quotes around the phrase suggests an earlier usage, perhaps by Huey Long, the Louisiana Governor, whose slogan was "Every Man a King"; Joe Klein of New York magazine informs me that the phrase was associated with Fiorello La Guardia's campaigning in the early 30's. If anyone can find a specific citation earlier than 1935, send it in; phrasedick immortality awaits.
When turned into a compound adjective, the slogan becomes an attack on the attack: a soak-the-rich scheme uses the phrase as a device to damn those who would unduly penalize the wealthy.
What's the difference between rich and wealthy? Webster's New World Dictionary holds that rich "is the general word for one who has more money or income-producing property than is necessary to satisfy his normal needs; wealthy adds to this connotations of grand living, influence in the community, a tradition of richness."
Perhaps that synonymy is true when the words are used as adjectives -- a rich family has to wait until its money ages before it becomes a wealthy family -- but when used by politicians as nouns, the wealthy is not nearly as rich a target as the rich. You never hear of "the filthy wealthy," or "get-wealthy-quick schemes." In any populist coupling of the needy and the greedy, it's the rich -- not the wealthy -- that gives a stump orator more polemical satisfaction. Today, the wealthy are spoken of with less of an envious sneer than the rich.
Affluent is a bookish term, given a high-domed academic air by John Kenneth Galbraith's "Affluent Society," and its subsequent alliterative use in "the age of affluence." No sloganeer would offer "soak the affluent" (although "marinate the affluent" might go as a bumper sticker in some hyper-educated, low-income areas along the Charles River).
How do rich people describe their own economic circumstances? Out of modesty, a repugnance for ostentation or a desire to hide from the revenooers, most would demur from any identification as being rich or wealthy, reserving those words for those nouveau-riche showoffs down the street with the opulent life style. The preferred admission, rather than assertion, of high economic status is "I'm well-to-do." A New York Times editorialist, sensing the political heft in the harsh word rich, wrote of the budget agreement: "Well-to-do families will pay more for Medicare, setting a constructive precedent."
Curiously, rich has long had a slang sense of "paradoxical, rich in irony" (using rich there to mean "full of, abundant in"). Stephen Sondheim's lyric to "Send in the Clowns" begins "Isn't it rich," meaning "catch this irony" or "isn't this something to make you shake your head in amused dismay."
Although rich is a term wriggled away from by those in the moneyed class who are loaded (a slang term that carries a connotation of admiration), the same rich is mandatory in all commercials for coffee. Copywriters can leave out full-bodied and try any number of synonyms for delicious, but skip rich and the client is sure to invite in a new agency. (The Squad Squad will find "invite in" redundant, but it is an acceptable shortening of "to ask someone to come in and deliver a presentation to a client that expects rich in every commercial.")
 
Mare Nostrum
 "IN YOUR COMMENTARY," wrote Habib Ladjevardi to Dan Rather of CBS, "you said that the President would be speaking on the situation in 'the Arabian Gulf, also known as the Persian Gulf.' I believe this is the first time that any of the networks have referred to the Persian Gulf as the Arabian Gulf."
Mr. Ladjevardi, associate director of the Center for Middle Eastern Studies at Harvard, noted that the term Arabian Gulf was the choice of the late President Gamal Abdel Nasser of Egypt and is now commonly used by Iraq's Saddam Hussein. "I am puzzled," he wrote, "by the introduction of the term Arabian Gulf by an American broadcasting company at this particular moment in history, especially since it coincides with your return from a visit to the Middle East."
When a copy of this note was vouchsafed to me by one of my academic moles, I queried CBS News. The network researcher tried National Geographic, which lists only Persian Gulf, but hit pay dirt with Webster's New Geographical Dictionary, which lists both Persian Gulf and Arabian Gulf as the same body of water.
"Our position is that Arabian Gulf is acceptable," says a CBS spokesman, Tom Goodman, "as long as we also explain that it is the Persian Gulf that's being identified. Persian Gulf is the standard name, and it requires no further explanation."
That's odd; it's like saying "Gotham, also known as New York City."
It strikes me that Saddam Hussein does not want to admit that the gulf in question has a special association with Persia, also known as Iran, a nation with which he just fought an eight-year war. The object of that war was access to that waterway; Iraq, having gained substantial access through Kuwait, has given back the narrow access it had won from Iran. By calling it the Arabian Gulf, Mr. Hussein (as The New York Times likes to refer to Saddam) lays linguistic claim to it on behalf of Arabs -- and Iranians are Persians, not Arabs. Mr. Rather apparently did not want to take sides and introduced this note of confusion into the nomenclature.
If history is used to decide the name, CBS is aware of the ancient appellation: Sinus Persicus, for "Persian bend." In the interests of peace and amity, I have a suggestion: how about the Gulf of Kurdistan?

In Beverly Hills, A Theme Park For Rich Adults

BYLINE: By Paul Goldberger

DATELINE: BEVERLY HILLS, Calif.

 BODY:
IF JUDITH KRANTZ HAD DESIGNED Disneyland, it would have turned out like Two Rodeo Drive. Whatever else can be said about this super-upscale shopping mall, whose first stores opened last month, it is surely the ultimate synthesis of the major Southern California fantasies: Disneyland crossed with Rodeo Drive. This place is not really a mall at all; it is more a kind of theme park for rich adults, a grown-ups' version of Disneyland's Main Street in which the attraction is not fake Victorian buildings filled with souvenir shops but architecturally ambitious stone and brick facades housing expensive and status-y boutiques.
 The first impulse is to dismiss this $200 million shopping complex as nothing more than the hopelessly silly expression of Beverly Hills hedonism. Well, it is the hopelessly silly expression of Beverly Hills hedonism, but it is also quite a lot else. And the more time you spend walking around it, the more seriously you begin to take it, both as a work of design in itself and as the manifestation of certain ideas that tell us a great deal about Los Angeles's yearnings.
 
 The complex, which occupies 1.25 acres at the intersection of Rodeo Drive and Wilshire Boulevard across the street from the Regent Beverly Wilshire Hotel, was designed by the architectural firms of Kaplan McLaughlin Diaz of San Francisco and Brand & Allen of Houston. But the basic concept came from the prime developer, Douglas L. Stitzel of San Francisco, who envisioned filling this trapezoidal site with a huge structure that would look to the pedestrian not like a single building but like a pair of streets lined with shops.
 Let it be said at the outset: this is one of the best pieces of stage-set architecture since Disneyland. The architects and Mr. Stitzel have come up with a series of shop fronts that meander through architectural history, with brief stops in classicism and the Beaux-Arts, a quick detour to a kind of Mediterranean architecture, and then a long, lingering stay in the Art Moderne of the 1920's and 30's. That style, a kind of stripped-down, simplified classicism enlivened by Art Deco touches, yields a section of the complex for Tiffany & Company that is a knockoff of Tiffany's great limestone store on Fifth Avenue, this version contorted in shape to meet the unusual angle of the site. But Art Moderne's 1930's-style mix of dignity and verve feels just right for Beverly Hills -- there is plenty of the real thing in the older shops nearby, like I. Magnin and Van Cleef & Arpels -- and it is interpreted inventively here.
 Actually everything is interpreted inventively here: that's the reason it is impossible not to like Two Rodeo more than you expect to. It's just too well done. If the concept of the place seems disingenuous, the reality is not. Two Rodeo is hardly innocent -- it is knowing and calculated in its manipulation of architectural sentiment -- but it does it so well that you are willingly swept up into its game. This is a place to wallow in, whatever your views of consumerism and the culture of Beverly Hills.
 The overall layout is ingenious. Mr. Stitzel realized, as all retail developers do, that the money in retail projects lay in ground-floor space. He also knew that there wasn't room for enough ground-floor space on this small site to justify the price of $500 per square foot of potential rentable space he would eventually pay. (Originally a hotel had been planned, until community protests led the City of Beverly Hills to rule out tall buildings on this site.) Mr. Stitzel's economic and architectural solution was elegantly simple -- to contort his retail complex into a structure that would have two separate ground floors.
 The first ground floor is on Rodeo Drive itself, in a row of storefronts that looks essentially like any row of elegant, older retail buildings on Madison Avenue in New York . The gimmick is in what is behind these storefronts, a new, curving street, called Via Rodeo, that slopes upward so that the ground floors of its buildings are actually the second floors of the buildings facing Rodeo Drive. Via Rodeo, which is paved with stone and lined with ornate, old-fashioned lamps, is a full story above Rodeo Drive. It begins as a gentle slope at one end of the project; at the other end, it descends to Wilshire Boulevard in the form of a grand marble staircase flanked by a fountain.
 Is this Beverly Hills pretending to be Italy? Of course it is. For all its existence Beverly Hills has pretended to be someplace else. That is why it feels like Beverly Hills: because this place is trying so hard to feel like somewhere else, we know we are really in Southern California. But this aspiring slice of Rome, mixed with a hint of New Bond Street, the rue Faubourg St.-Honore and Madison Avenue -- not to a mention a whiff of the Belgian Village from the 1964 New York World's Fair -- is so exuberant and so earnest in its fakery that if it seems cynical in concept, it comes off as endearing in actuality.
 Underneath the whole thing is a parking garage, naturally, and not just any old parking garage. This one offers a circular entrance and valet parking by attendants in spiffy suspenders who, after taking your car, point your way toward a marble lobby and elevators up to Via Rodeo. The elevators open into a Mediterranean-style tower set into a mock-Italian piazza that is at the highest point of the project, from which visitors can either saunter down the gentle slope of Via Rodeo or descend the marble staircase to Wilshire Boulevard.
 What could be more perfect? At Two Rodeo Drive, you can drive your car right into a real urban experience. From valet parking to street life -- here is the dream of the 20th century fulfilled. After all, if only there were valet parking underneath Madison Avenue, New York might be more bearable.
 There never will be valet parking underneath Madison Avenue, of course, because life doesn't work that way. Madison Avenue, the rue Faubourg St.-Honore and the other great shopping streets of the world are real places, with real histories that have grown and developed over time. They possess the authenticity of real cities, but also the harshness, the inconvenience, the difficulty of real places. Two Rodeo Drive is altogether different, an exercise in make-believe -- a private realm, like Disneyland, in which everything can be made seductively perfect.
 Twenty-five years ago, in a remarkable essay entitled "You Have to Pay for the Public Life," the architect Charles Moore observed that Disneyland, though a private place, was the ultimate piece of public architecture in Southern California, since it was the one place in that land of freeways and detached houses in which it was possible to have a conventional urban experience. The same can surely be said of the Two Rodeo Drive complex: for all its falseness, it represents a yearning for urbanity, a desire to make a place that, however suburban it may be in reality, at least feels like a city. Mr. Stitzel wanted to build a real urban street, not a covered suburban mall, and on some level or other he has succeeded. It is a particular paradox of Beverly Hills that it takes a stage set to convey a sense of real urbanity.

Stretching Dollars on the Slopes

BYLINE: By STANLEY CARR

 BODY:
NOW that the economy has turned chilly, ski resorts across the country are concentrating less on expansion and investment -- popular words in ski country in the 80's -- and more on attractive pricing to please skiers with tighter belts. A flurry of discounts, deals and packages indicates that budget conscious skiers can do well shopping around and bargain hunting in the coming season.
One strategy for cutting costs is to plan a vacation during the shoulder or value periods, which are before Christmas, some weeks in January -- with dates varying from mountain to mountain -- and the latter part of the season. At these times lodging and packages that include lodging and lift tickets are cheaper. Prices are generally lower in midweek than on weekends. At many mountains, first-time skiers qualify for free or discounted group lessons and rental skis, poles and boots. In New England several areas are offering a free lesson and rentals during the week of Dec. 15 to 21. 
 One trend at many resorts is offering free accommodations and lift tickets for children when their parents take rooms and buy lift tickets. More and more skiers are renting condominiums on or near the slopes and squeezing in another couple of guests in, say, a one-bedroom unit.
Most major ski centers now have toll-free 800 central reservation numbers that are sources for price-cutting packages that may not be listed in brochures. Packages can include everything from lodging to rented skis, and sometimes air fare, at far lower cost than when the components are purchased separately. Taos in New Mexico has a seven-night trip with air fare from New York at $1,698 that would be between $350 and $450 more if an individual pulled arrangements together.
Consumer ski organizations and ski clubs with discount plans for members are other avenues to cost cutting. At many places members get discounts of $2 to $4 a day on lift tickets and reductions at hotels and restaurants that are generally 10 to 15 percent but sometimes much higher. Discounts are usually lower during peak times and on weekends and holidays. Among these consumer ski organizations are:
The American Ski Association, 64 Inverness Drive East, Englewood, Colo. 80112 (800-525-7669 or 303-397-7669), which issues the SkiAmericard, good for reductions on lifts, lodging, ski rentals and dining at about 300 resorts and for some air fares. The card costs $30 a year for the first purchaser in a group or family, $15 for the second and $10 for each additional. (The association also offers a ShredAmericard used by snowboarders at the same prices.)
The United States Recreational Ski Association, 1315 East Pacifico Avenue, Anaheim, Calif. 92805 (714-634-1050), acts as a watchdog for skiers' interests as well as offering discounts at more than 100 ski areas. Members get $5 off lift tickets and reductions on lodgings at some resorts and on some packages. A membership card costs $34, $60 for two, or $75 for a family.
Ski Card International, Box 3369, Evergreen, Colo. 80439 (800-333-2754) offers cardholders discounts on lifts, lodging and other resort purchases, a $50 rebate on some Continental Airlines ski packages and 15 percent off some ski trips to Europe. In fall and winter the Ski Card costs $40 for the first purchaser, $35 for the second, $30 for the third; in spring members may renew at half price.
National Ski Card, Box 17574, Denver, Colo. 80217 (303-825-0944), charges $6.95 for its book of discount coupons for lifts, lessons and other ski costs at hundreds of ski areas. At Breckenridge, Colo., cardholders get discounts on the lifts every day of the season, from $7 a day in peak weeks to $14 in off-peak. At Stratton Mountain in Vermont, lifts are reduced $5 or $7 a day.
Dan Ferley, president of National Ski Card, said reductions on lodgings are as high as 50 percent at some locations. His organization, which also runs a discount travel company offering ski packages with cut-rate air fares, had 890,000 members in the 1989-90 season, he said.
Linda Ekanger, of the American Ski Association, estimates that less than 20 percent of Coloradans who ski pay full price for lift tickets, and says out-of-state skiers are increasingly picking up on the in-state deals.
One of the most popular ways Coloradans save is by buying Gold C books every fall. The books, which cost $9 apiece, are fat with coupons offering savings of 20 to 50 percent on one-day lift tickets, ski equipment, lessons and lodging at nearly 20 Colorado resorts. The books, which are sold locally, usually as part of various fund-raising events, are also available from Gold C Saving Spree, 1670 York Street, Denver, Colo. 80206 (303-388-4668). Gold C charges $1 for postage or $2 for priority mail.
Safeway and King Soopers supermarkets, Vickers gasoline stations and Pizza Huts in the Denver area sell lift tickets at selected ski areas that are reduced by $2 to $5 a day. Tickets purchased from the supermarkets are fully refundable if they are not used, unlike those purchased in multiday ski-lift packages. For store locations and the ski areas discounted, call Safeway at 800-444-3211 or 303-843-7600, or King Soopers at 303-698-3454 or 3470.
The following survey presents a selection of discounted packages and rate reductions at ski areas in the Northeast, West and Canada.
 
THE WEST
 
CALIFORNIA
SQUAW VALLEY USA
Squaw Valley, Calif. 95730
800-545-4350, central reservations; 916-583-6955, snow conditions
 Cutting Costs:: Although the resort has a reputation for Olympic caliber racing, beginning and intermediate level skiing is available, and a Fun in the Sun program gives first-time skiers free lifts, lessons and rental equipment on weekdays in nonholiday periods. The instruction is given at several checkpoints spread out at the top of the cable-car run. There's a similar program on weekends costing $20 a person.
The Squaw Valley Hostel, scheduled to open at Thanksgiving within walking distance of the lifts, will offer dormitory-style lodging with 95 beds at $15 a night and $5 extra for linens. There are a few small rooms for 2 to 4 people and some larger ones sleeping 20 to 25. Bathrooms are shared.
Discounts are offered on lift tickets purchased midweek or in multiday packages. Usual cost: $38, full-day; $26, half-day; children 12 and under and skiers 65 and over, $10; cable car or gondola ride for nonskiers, $10 and $5 for children.
Modeled after European resorts, Squaw Valley USA offers two villages at different elevations, both overlooking Lake Tahoe. Six peaks and 4,000 acres of open bowl are served by 32 lifts, including a 150-passenger aerial cable car, the six-passenger Super Gondola and 3 high-speed quads.
With a lift capacity of 47,000 an hour, the resort guarantees no waiting in line -- or your money back. The vertical drop is 2,850 feet and the longest run is three miles. Ski season is mid-November through May.
What's New: The Resort at Squaw Creek, a 405-room deluxe lodge at 6,200 feet, opens Dec. 14. Prices start at $195 a night for two. A triple lift connects the new resort to the Squaw Valley ski complex, where eight new trails for intermediate skiers have been added. The Olympic Ice Pavillion, an Olympic-size outdoor ice-skating rink at the top of the cable car, at 8,200 feet, offers two hours of skating for $5. Two heated tennis courts have been added adjacent to the rink.
 
COLORADO
ASPEN
Aspen Skiing Company, Post Office Box 1248, Aspen, Colo. 81612.
800-262-7736, information and reservations; 303-925-1221 for snow report
 Cutting Costs: This season the Aspen Skiing Company raised the cost of a one-day lift ticket to $40, securing Aspen's reputation as the most expensive place in the country to ski. The new lift price is a $4 increase over last season. But hold on -- reputations are not all that they seem, even in Aspen. "You can pay $40 a day," says an Aspen official, "but only if you are dumb." In one break from past years, Aspen is hawking the discounts more and the deluxe a little less, and reflecting a current trend at many resorts, the latest innovations at Aspen are more likely to be related to pricing than to slopeside technology.
For the first time, skiers aged 70 and over and children under 6 can ski free. A six-out-of-seven-day lift ticket costs $216, or $204 if purchased in advance for the value season, which is the same price as last year. The best way to ski for less in Aspen is to vacation during the "value season," which occupies a full 50 percent of the ski year -- the weeks before Christmas, the month of January and April. The resort recently published its "Insiders Tips for Experiencing Aspen on a Budget" to help visitors find the affordable. To receive this listing of moderately priced lodgings and restaurants, write to: Terri Hart Roberts, Aspen Skiing Company, at the address above.
Another way to cut costs is to purchase a SkiAmericard, which offers discounts on lodging, equipment and food in the Aspen area (and at many other Colorado ski resorts).
Skiing in Aspen offers the opportunity of skiing on one or all of four distinct mountains: Aspen Highlands, Aspen Mountain, Buttermilk and Snowmass, 12 miles down valley. Aspen Mountain, which rises to an elevation of 11,212 from its base 3,267 feet below, is rated for intermediate and expert skiers only. Beginners and low intermediate skiers head for Aspen Highlands, which has a vertical drop of 3,800 feet, or Buttermilk, which has a summit at 9,900 feet and a vertical drop of 2,030 feet.
 
COPPER MOUNTAIN
Post Office Box 3001, Copper Mountain, Colo. 80443
800-458-8386; snow report, 303-968-2100
 Cutting Costs: The official lift price is $33 for adults and $16 for children, but the Gold C coupon book includes many discounts for Copper. The books, which cost $9 apiece, offer savings of 20 to 30 percent on lift passes, rentals, lessons and food. The books are sold locally as part of fund-raising events but are also available from Gold C Saving Spree, 1760 York Street, Denver, Colo. 80206 (303-388-4668). The SkiAmericard, which earns a $7 discount on an adult lift ticket and reductions at some lodgings and restaurants, is also honored at Copper.
The resort offers several new packages allowing children under age 12 to ski free -- from opening day until Dec. 14 and from Jan. 2 to Feb. 14 -- if they share a room with parents who buy lift tickets. Skiers aged 60 to 69 can get a lift pass for $20; those over 70 ski free.
Seventy-five miles from Denver and just off Interstate 70, Copper Mountain is a favorite of Front Range residents because of its fairly long runs and accessibility. The mountain rises to a summit of 12,360 feet from its 9,600-foot base, with a vertical drop of 2,760 feet. The longest run is 2.8 miles. There are 20 lifts, including two high-speed quads and six triple chairlifts. The resort includes a Club Med.
What's New: Copper is nearing the end of a five-year, $40 million expansion, which this season includes the opening -- in February -- of the Day Lodge-Conference Center housing meeting rooms, cafeteria and lounge.
 
PURGATORY-DURANGO
Post Office Box 666, Durango, Colo. 81302
800-525-0892 for all reservations and snow report
 Cutting Costs: Purgatory-Durango, which normally draws skiers from the Southwest, offers seven-night, six-day or five-night, four-day package trips that include air fare between Denver or Albuquerque and the Durango airport, about 45 miles from the slopes. Air fare from Denver, lodging in the town of Durango (25 miles from the mountain), lift tickets and transportation to and from the Durango airport start at $365 a person for seven nights and go up to $558 for slopeside accommodations. A five-night plan with air fare between Albuquerque and Durango costs from $257 a person, with lodging in Durango, lift tickets and transfers. Also, by making arrangements through the toll-free number, skiers save 20 percent on lessons and equipment rental. Limited discounts on lift tickets and lessons are available with the Ski-Americard. The posted lift ticket price is $34, $17 for children and $20 for seniors.
Tucked into a seam of the San Juan Mountains in southwest Colorado, Purgatory-Durango is as far off the beaten track as Copper Mountain is right on it. The area boasts no high-speed quad chairs; since there are never any lift lines, says a resort spokesman, Purgatory does not need the machinery to move people up quickly. Trails are somewhat narrower than at other areas, which enhances the scenery and the solitude without making skiers feel like they are skiing down a chute.
The mountain's base is 8,793 feet, and rises to 10,822. The longest ski run is two miles.
 
SNOWMASS
c/o Aspen Skiing Company, Post Office Box 1248, Aspen, Colo. 81612
303-925-1220 for information, 303-925-1220 for snow report
 Cutting Costs: Price reductions are offered through SkiAmericard. The resort is also discounting lessons at its Family Ski School by 10 percent for four or more family members.
At the base of Snowmass Village is the Snowmass Lodge and Club, with indoor tennis, pool and fitness center, and a special offer of lift tickets. The club's rates begin at about $150 a night in value season and $225 in peak season and include two to six free lift tickets per day, depending on the number of bedrooms in the unit.
Although Snowmass is owned by the Aspen Skiing Company, its distance from Aspen, the town, and the vast, open terrain make it a ski area unto itself. It is also one of the largest mountains, with a lift capacity of more than 20,000 people an hour via three fast quad lifts, two triple chairs, nine double chairs and two platter pulls.
Snowmass Mountain rises to a summit of 11,835 feet, from a base at 8,220 feet. Its longest run is 4.1 miles. Nine percent of the terrain is rated for beginners, 51 percent is for intermediates, and the remaining 40 percent for the advanced.
What's New: Added this season is a half-pipe for the growing number of snowboarders.
 
VAIL
Post Office Box 7, Vail, Colo. 81658
800-525-2257 or 303-949-5750 (extension 4030 for reservations)
 Cutting Costs: To reduce expenses at Vail it is best to schedule a seven-night, six-day stay before Christmas, during January, or in early spring. The cheapest package during these times is $518 a person, including lodging, lift tickets, taxes and ground transportation from Eagle County Airport.
The official one-day adult lift ticket price is $38, but the multiple-day packages reduce the price to $35 a day. Skiers aged 65 to 69 ski for $28 a day, and skiers over 70 ski free.
Discounts on lift tickets on certain days -- savings of $12 to $18 for an adult and $6 for a child -- are available with Gold C coupon books. The books, sold locally for $9 and are also available from Gold C Saving Spree, 1760 York Street, Denver, Colo. 80206 (303-388-4668). They are also good for discounts on cross-country skiing fees.
Vail, the largest ski area on a single mountain in the United States, has a lift capacity of 35,820 skiers an hour. The mountain's base is at 8,200 feet, its top elevation is 11,450, for a vertical rise of 3,250 feet. The longest run is 4.5 miles.
What's New: Beginning Dec. 15, American Airlines will fly daily, nonstop 757's from Chicago and Dallas to Vail's Eagle County Airport, enabling skiers originating their trips in the East to miss the snarls at Denver's Stapleton Airport and the 100 miles of driving between Denver and the resort.
As with many other ski resorts, there has been little in the way of slopeside improvements at Vail or its sister resort Beaver Creek this year. The relatively modest addition of a half-pipe at both Vail and Beaver Creek is good news for snowboarders. Four new lodges are opening at Beaver Creek: Beaver Creek Lodge this month, Camberley Club Hotel in December, and Borders Lodge and St. James Place in February.
 
IDAHO
 
SILVER MOUNTAIN
610 Bunker Avenue, Kellogg, Idaho 83837-2200
208-783-1111; snow report, 800-678-8633
 Cutting Costs: The Coeur d'Alene Resort, a half hour's drive from the slopes, offers some good deals on lodging for visitors to Silver Mountain, opening this month -- the first new major ski area in the United States in a decade. The midweek package at $109.99 a person includes two days of lifts and lodging for two nights, Continental breakfast, bottle of champagne and transportation to the mountain. On weekends a similar two-night package is $149.95. A five-day package at $289.95 a person includes lifts and lodging and similar extras. The Holiday Inn in Coeur d'Alene offers a $108 two-night lifts-lodging plan that comes with Continental breakfast and transportation to the slopes. The Wallace Inn has two-day lift-lodging plans priced from $124.50 a person midweek, and $134.50 weekends.
A gondola running for 3.1 miles moves skiers between the town of Kellogg and the ski area on Kellogg Peak, which is in Idaho's northwestern panhandle. (The gondola was funded in part by a $6.4 million Federal grant aimed to rejuvenate this economically depressed, former silver mining town.) Four chairlifts serve 43 runs on 2,000 skiable acres. The mountain, which encompasses the former Silverhorn ski area, is rated 15 percent beginner, 45 percent intermediate and 40 percent advanced. Along with the downhill runs are meadows left untouched for powder hounds.
 There is limited lodging in the small town of Kellogg. Many visitors will choose to stay in the Coeur d'Alene, a larger community at the edge of a 26-mile-long lake, 30 minutes from the slopes.
Daily lift tickets (9 A.M. to 10 P.M.) are $26; $19 for juniors aged 7 to 17, college students and people 65 and older. Half-day tickets are $19, and $15 for juniors, college students and seniors. Children 6 and under ski free.
 
SUN VALLEY
Sun Valley, Idaho 83353
208-622-4111; for reservations at Sun Valley Company properties, 800-786-8259; or for other properties in Sun Valley or Ketchum, 800-634-3347
 Cutting Costs: Parents should take their teen-agers because at Sun Valley the Kids Stay and Ski Free program is open to children 17 and younger. A maximum of two children per parent can ski and stay free when a family lodges in a participating hotel or condominium from Nov. 22 to Dec. 23, Jan. 1 to Feb. 9 and March 17 to May 1. At lodges in Ketchum the youngsters' program is limited to skiing -- not staying -- free.
Sun Valley's seven-night theme-week packages used to be limited to groups. Now they are open to individuals. The $320-a-person Prime Time Special from Jan. 5 to 12, for skiers aged 60 and more, includes lodging, a five-of-six-day lift ticket, Big Band dinner dance and a race. The It Happened in Sun Valley package, Jan. 12 to 19, is just for singles. Rates start at $326 a person for lodging, lifts and parties. Packages also start at $326 for Winter Carnival, Jan. 19 to 26, the resort's major winter festival; and Western Ski Club Week (open to anyone), from Jan. 26 to Feb. 2, with its barn dance and country swing lessons.
Sun Valley's first poster, showing a man stripped to the waist skiing in sunny weather, popularized the resort to a wealthy crowd who loved "roughing it" -- as long as there were luxuries like wind-protected outdoor pools, fine dining and an orchestra playing nightly. You can still find these amenities, along with modernized access to spectacular skiing in several vast bowls and many challenging trails. A few years ago, Sun Valley replaced several aging lifts with high-speed quads. Today, 10 lifts march up the main mountain, 3,400-vertical-foot Baldy; another 4 are strung on Dollar Mountain (628 vertical feet), popular with novices.
Lodging is grouped in four loose pods. Most of the more luxurious accommodations are in Sun Valley, a village a short shuttle-bus ride from the slopes. There's also lodging at the base of the Warm Springs lifts, at the base of Dollar Mountain (a short ride from Baldy) and in Ketchum.
Daily lift tickets are $38; $21 for children, $22 for those 65 and older on Baldy; $21 and $15 for children on Dollar. Half-day tickets are $28; $15 for children on Baldy; $21 and $15 for children on Dollar. On Baldy, six-of-seven-day tickets are $198, $102 for children,
What's New: New this year, from Dec. 15, is daily Skywest Airlines service between Salt Lake City and Sun Valley. The four daily round-trip flights on Skywest are timed to connect with Delta Air Lines flights into Salt Lake. This season Sun Valley regulars will notice changes on the Warm Springs side of Baldy Mountain. The Limelight chair was removed and the Limelight run recontoured, part of the Hemingway trail was reshaped and Cozy was lengthened. A computerized snowmaking system was installed and the man-made snow should enable an earlier opening of more terrain.
 
NEW MEXICO
 
TAOS
Taos Ski Valley, N. M. 87525
505-776-2291; reservations, 800-992-7669 or, in state, 505-776-2233
 Cutting Costs: Skiers get 20 percent off lifts, lodging and ski school from Nov. 25 to Dec. 21, and from March 31 to April 7, at some properties in the valley, including the Hotel St. Bernard. Other reductions are available at other lodges, among them Hotel Edelweiss and Thunderbird Lodge. From Jan. 5 to Feb. 2, visitors get approximately 10 percent off five- and six-day lift-lodging-lessons packages at participating lodges. The most popular packages in the valley include seven nights' lodging, three meals daily, six days of lifts and half-day lessons. The lodges in the town of Taos offer nightly rates or lift-lodging packages of from three to seven nights. Round-trip flights between major cities and Albuquerque and a rental car are included in many packages.
A visit including round-trip air fare from New York with seven nights' lodging at the Thunderbird, three meals, car, lift tickets and lessons in regular season will cost $1,698 a person, with taxes and gratuities. Three nights' lodging and three days' skiing without the extras and not including tax is $177 a person, double occupancy.
Perhaps the best small resort in the United States, Taos melds exhilarating skiing and ski-school classes that even advanced skiers like to attend, with a taste of Southwestern food and art. Condos and small hotels snug up to the slopes that sprawl across one of the mountain peaks enclosing this box canyon. Eight chairs and two surface lifts open up the slopes, bowls and chutes on 2,612-foot vertical mountain. There are wide-open intermediate trails, but Taos's fame comes from the advanced terrain covering 51 percent of the mountain.
Most guests eat meals where they are staying and spend the week in ski school with the same group. But if you're the type of vacationer with a high-energy apres-ski level, stay in the town of Taos, 25 minutes down the canyon past the Taos Pueblo. There's bus service to the ski valley for skiers who don't want to drive themselves.
Daily lift ticket rates are $32, and $17 for children 12 and younger; half-day rates are $20 and $12 for children. Skiers aged 65 to 69 pay $10; those 70 or older ski free. Multiday lift tickets (three days or more) are $29 a day and $15 for children.
What's New: A new chairlift, Seventh Heaven, stretches from the top of chair 7 on the mountain's backside to the top of chair 6 at the summit. Now skiers on the backside can ride to the summit and ski down the front side; before they had to make a long traverse around the base of the mountain. Snowmaking has been added around the top of chair 7 as part of a long-term plan to insure top-to-bottom coverage.
 
OREGON
 
MOUNT HOOD MEADOWS
Post Office Box 470, Mount Hood, Ore. 97041-0470
503-337-2222; snow conditions, 503-227-7669; hotel reservations, Mount Hood Recreation Association, 503-622-3162
 Cutting Costs: For $39, skiers can skip driving to the mountain through the Bus-Lift program (503-287-5438). The package is available on weekends and holidays, November through February, and includes a round-trip bus ride from five Portland locations -- the city is 67 miles to the west -- and an all-day lift ticket.
Lift tickets are $25 a day; $29 day-night (until 10 P.M.); $18 half-day (Monday and Tuesday); children, $15; seniors, half price on all tickets. Ticketmaster and ski shops sell Express Tickets for $24 for the day-night session. Group rates for 25 people start at $21.
For $84 on weekdays, The Inn at Cooper Spur, in the town of Mount Hood, offers cabins and lift tickets for two. The Resort at the Mountain, in Welches, offers a double room, with two lift tickets and free shuttle, for $106. Timberline, a 50-year-old rustic hotel, is the only overnight resort lodge on the mountain. A room for two costs $105.
The resort, on the southeast slope of Mount Hood, offers a no-frills approach to skiing. There are no snowmaking machines, just 2,150 acres of natural snow-covered terrain, a panoramic view of the Cascade Mountain Range, and 26 kilometers of Nordic trails that wind past lakes, frozen waterfalls and streams.
It is the largest and most diverse of three resorts on the mountain -- the others are Timberline and Ski Bowl -- with nine lifts carrying 14,400 skiers an hour. The vertical drop is 2,777 feet, and the longest run is three miles. Vouchers are available for the other two resorts. The ski season is mid-November through mid-May.
Two large day lodges house snack bars, sports shops, lounges and restaurants. The Finish Line Bar and Grill features an 18-by-120-foot glass wall with a view of the summit. The Try Before You Buy Demo Center allows sampling of equipment from a variety of ski, boot and snowboard manufacturers.
What's New: A slow-development policy means few changes from year to year. All three resorts prefer to maintain a back-to-nature ambiance.

SNOWBASIN
Post Office Box 348, Huntsville, Utah 84317
801-399-1135; snow report, 801-399-0198
 Cutting Costs: On the slopes, Snowbasin offers a package for never-ever skiers that offers group lesson, lift and rentals for $12 from Nov. 26 to Dec. 23 and $15 the rest of the season.
At the Jackson Fork Inn, at the base of the mountain road, $450 buys five days' lifts and four nights' lodging for two people in a room with a jacuzzi bath. Packages at the Wolf Lodge Condos in Odgen Valley, 10 miles from Ogden, start at $395 for two for four days of lifts, three nights' lodging and a rental car from Salt Lake City airport. Lodging in Odgen ranges from under $30 at a Motel 6 to the Radisson Suite Hotel's $385 package for two consisting of lift tickets for five days, four nights' lodging in a two-room suite and full breakfast.
There are attractive lodging rates in Salt Lake City, about an hour and a half from the mountain. Room rates at the Doubletree are $89 a night on weekdays, $69 on weekends, and include a full breakfast. Rooms at the Marriott go from $125 on weekdays and $88 on weekends. At Little America Hotel and Towers, rates are $95 on weekdays, $85 on weekends. At the Howard Johnson Hotel at Temple Square rooms start at $52. Nendels Inn rooms cost from $42 to $52. Many of the hotels and motels in Salt Lake City offer packages with lodging and lift tickets at several nearby ski areas.
Snowbasin is what skiing was about before glitz was added to the sport. Although the trail map lists only 39 runs, most of the 2,400-vertical-foot mountain is skiable. Five chairlifts reach the trails, bowls and glades of fir and aspen. On a clear day, your ski tips will frame the jewel called Pineview Reservoir, set in the unpopulated Odgen Valley 1,000 feet below.
Snowbasin was an area for Ogden residents until the opening of Trappers' Loop Road (State Route 167) shortened the drive from Salt Lake City. Now Salt Lake skiers who hate crowds come here, especially on weekends, when a lift line of a dozen bodies affronts the regulars.
There are no accommodations at the slopes, and limited lodging and night life in the Ogden valley. Many skiers stay in Ogden, 25 minutes away, or Salt Lake City. Visitors need a car to visit Snowbasin.
Snowbasin's daily lift tickets are $21, $15 for children 11 and under. Half-day tickets are $17, $13 for children.
 
SNOWBIRD
Snowbird Ski Resort, Snowbird, Utah 84092-6019
800-453-3000, central reservatons; other information and snow report 801-742-2222
 Cutting Costs: Children 12 and under, lodging in their parents' room, ski free when the parents buy lift tickets -- one child per adult ticket. The American Express lift and lodging packages start at $44 a person, double occupancy, a day during the "value seasons" from opening day to Dec. 20, and April 5-27. The Chickadee chairlift, which serves beginners' terrain, is always free. The Snowbird Host program offers free two-hour tours during which guests are shown runs and lifts best suited to their abilities.
The Snowbird resort's base village is a 20th-century creation: a concrete citadel guarding a narrow gap in Little Cottonwood Canyon. Access to the runs stretching up the side of the canyon is aboard a cable-car tram and seven chairlifts. While many first-time visitors feel that the slopes, especially the difficult runs under the tram, look "heart-stoppingly" steep, there are miles of intermediate trails reached by the chairs.
Toward the end of the day, skiers often fill the massage rooms in the Cliff Spa at Snowbird, which offers a range of treatments including herbal and parafango wraps.
Unspoiled Alta ski area, noted for a cheap lift ticket ($21), is three miles along the canyon via shuttle bus. The Mormons' Temple Square and other downtown Salt Lake City sights are a 30-minute bus ride in the opposite direction.
Snowbird's all-lift tickets, which include use of the tram, are $35; chairs only, $28. Children 12 and under and people 62 and older pay $20 for an all-lift ticket; $15 for chairs only. Half-day tickets (morning or afternoon) are $28 all-lifts; $22 chairs only. Children and older people pay $15 all-lifts; $13 chairs only. Skiers 70 and over ski free.
What's New: This winter there's a new run for intermediate skiers in the Tiger Trail area off the Gad II lift. Improved grooming and better signs will make it easier for intermediates to ski from the tram, down a trail that crisscrosses advanced terrain so they can watch expert skiers' styles. All Snowbird guests can use the indoor tennis and racquetball courts at the recently purchased Canyon Racquet Club.

Post Office Box 450, Bethel, Me. 04217
207-824-3000; reservations, 800-543-2754; 207-824-6400, snow reports
 Cutting Costs: Skiers on a budget can head for the Snowcap Lodge, a dormitory with 164 bunks within walking distance of the lifts. Blocks of bunks are often allocated to groups; the remainder are available at $20 a person a night in midweek and $25 on weekends. Each of the lodge's rooms, which have four to eight bunks, has a shared bath.
The ski area is introducing a number of cost-cutting packages, ranging from weekend and ski-lift inclusive cut-price deals to 10 percent off for residents of Connecticut during its school vacation week.
Condominium accommodations near the trails, from studios for two people to three-bedroom units for up to eight people, are offered. A package combining a room with lift tickets can be set up for a two- , three- or four-night weekend, or a five-night midweek package for adults or juniors (ages 6 to 12). Sunday River's Perfect Turn Discovery package and its Guaranteed Learn-to-Ski program are also being offered as ingredients of plans. The Perfect Turn program offers intensive lessons to smooth a participant's skiing in his or her choice of terrain: steep or deep, bumps or boulevard. The learn-to-ski program offers lessons that the instructors say will insure that the neophyte can ski independently after one day.
To put all this into perspective, consider a family of four: a once-good skier who hasn't skied much lately; a spouse who has never skied, and their two children, aged 8 and 10. They decide on a three-day weekend in a one-bedroom condo for four. The cost for one adult will be $211, plus a $15 supplement for a Perfect Turn clinic to sharpen rusty skills. For the spouse it will be $211 plus a $115 supplement for a full three days of the Learn-to-Ski program. Condo and lift rates for the children will be $171 each, plus a supplement of $109 each if they are enrolled in the Mogul Meister program, which offers all-day coaching and teaching at any ability level, plus lunch.
The family may also find its own lodging in the Bethel area through the Bethel Reservation Service (207- 824-3585).
If the family has time for only one day's skiing, their lift tickets will cost the adults $31 for a weekday or $36 for a weekend day or holiday. Juniors ski for $20 daily, weekday or weekend. Half-day tickets, going into effect at 1 P.M., are $22 or, on weekends and holidays, $25 and $15 for juniors. A family from Connecticut that takes its ski week Feb. 10 to 15 -- during Connecticut's school break -- will get an extra 10 percent off the cost of a package that includes condo and lift tickets.
What's New: Four trails were added to the snowmaking system this past summer. The area set up a new Guaranteed Learn-to-Ski center and expanded the handicapped skiers' program, with more staff members and a new building. And for those who don't cook in their condo kitchens, it is opening two new family restaurants: Rosetto's, in the Whitecap base lodge, serving Italian specialties, and Saturday's, in the South Ridge base complex, offering Mexican dishes.
 
MASSACHUSETTS
 
BRODIE MOUNTAIN
Route 7, New Ashford, Mass. 01237
413-443-4752
Cutting Costs: One of the the best ski deals in the Berkshires is at Brodie Mountain, with its four-day, three-night nonholiday midweek package at $179.50 a person and $135 for children 12 and under. Accommodations are at Brodie's Kerry House and Dublin Motel at the foot of the slopes or at the Carriage House at the Brodie Mountain Racquet Club, a mile to the north on Route 7. As the regular one-night midweek room rate is $60 for two, the package plan, according to Brodie, saves about $55 a person, compared with the cost of buying the components separately. The plan, good for Monday through Thursday only, includes lodging, four days of lift tickets (regularly $25 a day), a welcoming wine and cheese party on the opening Monday evening, breakfast each morning, an apres-ski cocktail in the Blarney Room, a group lesson and a discount at the indoor tennis and racquetball courts. The price includes taxes and tips.
Brodie, with four double chairlifts and two rope tows serving its 25 slopes and trails, has a vertical drop of 1,250 feet, the greatest in the Berkshires. The area is open daily from 9 A.M. to 11 P.M.; half of its trails are lighted and, for the first time, the snowmaking system covers 100 percent of the terrain. There is also a full-service cross-country ski center a mile to the south.
John Koch heads the ski school, with lessons in downhill, telemark and cross-country skiing, including the skating stride. There are two large base lodges, one housing the Blarney Room, the largest ski-area cocktail lounge in New England, seating 500 people. There are also hook-ups for 250 campsites for recreational vehicles adjacent to the lower Tipperary Trail.
The Williams College ski team trains at Brodie and holds its winter carnival there each February. Brodie's Jim Kelly Invitational Pro Giant Slalom is the oldest continuously-run pro ski race in the nation and its 25th running will be held on March 10, the start of the area's annual St. Patrick's Festival continuing through March 17.
Lift tickets: weekends and holidays, $30 for a full day, $26 half-day (1 to 5 P.M.); juniors, $25 and $21. Weekdays, $25 and $23; juniors, $20 and $18. Twilight (3 to 11 P.M.): $23 for everyone; night tickets (7 to 11): $15 for everyone. Four-hour tickets, which can be purchased at any time before 1 P.M., are $23.
Ski, boot and pole rentals: $20 and $15 for juniors. Group lessons: $15; private, $30.
What's New: Snowmaking expansion this past summer included the novice Tipperary run, which can also be fun for the advanced. The expanded network means that all 17 miles of trails can be covered with machine-made snow. To manicure its snow, machine-made or natural, Brodie has acquired additional grooming equipment.

518-251-2411; snow conditions, 518-251-2523 or 800-342-1234 in New York State
Cutting Costs: Through the winter, this Adirondacks ski area 40 miles north of Glens Falls is offering a midweek rate for daily lift passes of $24 for adults and $17 for juniors (age 12 and under). Bigger savings can be realized during early- and late-season periods (from opening day after Thanksgiving to Dec. 21 and from March 18 to closing) when the prices drop to $18 and $12. Through the winter, new skiers can use three novice lifts on the lower mountain and take an hour-and-a-half class lesson for $25.
Gore is one of the few areas in the country offering train packages, but after leaving the train at Albany skiers must rent a car and drive for about 90 minutes. There are two-night weekend all-inclusive packages for $251 a person and five-night midweek packages for $341. These include round-trip rail fare from Grand Central Terminal to Albany, two or five nights' accommodations, three or five days of lift tickets and taxes and gratuities. Northstar Tours (800-338-8898) is making the arrangements.
The mountain's lift ticket prices for weekends and holidays are $30 and $19 for juniors. People over age 70 ski free on all lifts, and youngsters of 6 and under ski free on novice lifts. Citizens 62 to 69 years old pay the same rates for lift tickets as juniors 12 and under.
What's New: Around the base of the mountain, Gore has maintained 11 kilometers (6.8 miles) of cross-country trails since the early 60's. This year these trails were regraded to make them more user friendly. On the mountain, many trails were widened and regroomed.
For youngsters 2 to 6 years old, an all-day Dino-mite program has been expanded to include rental equipment, lunch and supervised play for $51.
The snowboard program, introduced last season, has been expanded and includes a demonstration center with 50 K2 and Burton boards to rent plus instruction.

518-734-4300; snow reports, 800-729-4766; lodging, 800-729-7549
Cutting Costs: To attract more skiers during midweek periods, Ski Windham in the northern Catskills has created several new packages under the title Weekday Advantages. The Business Ski Escape, for instance, is a lift ticket, one and three-quarter hour group lesson, buffet lunch, apres-ski drink and use of the Commerce Club, an office with business services in the base lodge, for $37 a day. The same items bought individually would cost $60 to $65.
A Ladies' Day with similar features and a 50 percent discount for one nonskiing child to spend the day in the Children's Learning Center costs $36. Ordinarily the fee for a nonskiing child in the center, which is for youngsters aged 1 to 7, is $40 a day; the price for a skiing youngster at the center is $55. Couples' Day offers two-fers on breakfast, Nastar (national standard race) runs and apres-ski drinks with the purchase of two lift tickets.
The Weekday Fun Pack with one night of lodging, two days of skiing, one group lesson and a coupon book for use in the region is $80 a person, in double occupancy, versus $128 when bought individually. The Weekend Stretch is three nights lodging and three days of on the slopes with the coupon book for $157 or $187 a person, low or high season. The Weekend Pleaser is two days of skiing and two nights lodging with one group lesson of one and three-quarter hours and the coupon book for $116.
On nonholiday weekdays, people over 65 can ski at half price, while children 12 and under ski free. Regular prices for lift tickets are $25 and $22 for juniors during peak season (mid-December to mid-March) and $20 and $18 during nonpeak periods. From Jan. 22 to 25, Ski Windham will celebrate its 10th anniversary by rolling lift-ticket prices back to 1981 levels -- adults will pay $14 and juniors $12.
What's New: The 72,000-square-foot base lodge, new last season, has been fine-tuned with decorating and changes in service features. Additional computer stations, for instance, will speed ticketing, rental operations and lesson assignments. Snowboarders will have their own slope for lessons and practice, and a half-pipe, or U-shaped slope of snow, will be built for acrobatic tricks.
The Children's Learning Center, which had ski-instruction programs for 3- to 7-year-olds last season, will offer a Mogul Masters program for children 8 to 13 this winter. The full-day program with two two-hour lessons, lunch, lift ticket and supervised indoor activities costs $55, while a half-day with one lesson, lift ticket and indoor activities is $33.

BANFF-LAKE LOUISE
Banff National Park, Box 1085, Banff, Alberta, Canada T0L 0C0
403-762-4561 or 800-661-1363 for reservations and information, including snow conditions
 Cutting Costs: Three ski centers and two towns make up this winter resort region in Banff National Park west of Calgary. The slopes at the three -- Lake Louise, Sunshine Village and Mount Norquay -- total about 4,000 acres, which are usually covered with dry, light powder, which is traversed by the occasional elk as well as skiers.
The first saving -- prices are in United States dollars unless otherwise stated -- comes from the exchange rate, with the Canadian dollar trading at about 87 United States cents. An adult (18 plus) full-day lift ticket at Lake Louise, the most expensive center, at $34 Canadian, is $29.60 United States. Half-day (from noon) is $26, and $14.80 after 2.30 P.M. Youth (age 13-17) and student (18-25) lift tickets are $26 for the day, $23 half day and, after 2.30 P.M., $10.45. Children (6-12) are $7 at all times; those under 6 ski free. Five-day adult tickets are $133; five-day tickets for youths and students are $122. Children pay the day rate. Mount Norquay has night skiing (4 to 9 P.M. Wednesday to Friday) at $8 for all ages except children under 12, who pay $4. Tri-area lift tickets, which come with most packages, cost about $28 for adults and $14 for children a day. Rentals for skis, poles and boots range from about $56 for seven days at Sportsrent, a store in Banff, to $39 for three days at Lake Louise ski area.
Packages combining accommodations and lift tickets, offered by tour companies and hotels, are money savers. Packages of Ski Banff-Lake Louise, which represents the three centers, start at $348 a person in double occupancy, including six nights at the castle-like, 850-room Banff Springs Hotel, a five-day tri-area lift ticket, shuttle bus service between hotel and slopes and a one-night pass for Norquay.
The largest center of the three is at Lake Louise, a few minutes' drive from the town of the same name and a half hour from Banff. The center boasts 45 runs and a vertical drop of 3,257 feet. Sunshine, 15 minutes from Banff, offers 62 runs, a vertical of 3,514 feet and the region's only on-hill accommodations. Sunshine Village Inn, 7,000 feet up, is reached by a three-mile gondola lift from the valley floor. The ski area's snowfall averages 30 feet a year, the heaviest in the region.
As for cross-country, trails start in the towns and continue into the back country. Lake Louise leads the downhill centers with 30 miles of marked and groomed trails.
What's New: Mount Norquay has developed 70 acres of intermediate slopes served by two new quad chairs.
Lake Louise ski area runs a nursery for children aged 18 days to 18 months. Hours: 8 A.M. to 4.30 P.M. Cost: $17 a child a day. Day care is available at all the centers for children aged 19 months to 6 years. Hours: 8 A.M. to 5 P.M. The cost varies from $2 an hour at Lake Louise to $2.60 at Mount Norquay and $4.35 an hour at Sunshine Village. Junior ski camps, for children 6 to 12, are available at Sunshine and Lake Louise (both at $27 a day) and on weekends and holidays at Mount Norquay ($30).

HEADLINE: MOVIE RATINGS;
An X Is Bad For Business

 BODY:
To the Editor: Janet Maslin's statement that "for a little-known independent film, after all, an X isn't necessarily bad for business" is wildly inaccurate. Why, pray tell, have a number of respected American independent distributors like Miramax filed expensive lawsuits in the past year to have X ratings of high-quality films like Almodovar's "Tie Me Up! Tie Me Down!" overturned? And why did the distributors of Wayne Wang's "Life Is Cheap . . . but Toilet Paper Is Expensive" advertise their film in The Times with their own A rating rather than the Motion Picture Association of America's X rating?
The answer is simply economic. For better or worse, an X rating has become synonymous with pornographic, and, just as The New York Times does not carry ads for sexually explicit films, many theaters around the United States will not show films rated X. If the recent campaign for a change in the ratings system is any indication, most American independent distributors (not to mention film artists) find an X rating extremely bad for business; there are even some who suspect that the many X ratings given to American and foreign independents by the M.P.A.A. are part of a general Hollywood effort (strenuously denied by M.P.A.A. head Jack Valenti, of course) to drive the independents out of the American film marketplace.
Seen in this light, the NC-17 rating given to Universal's "Henry and June" (after a number of independents had failed to persuade Mr. Valenti to change the system) is proof that Hollywood itself believes that an X rating is bad for business. Indeed, it is hard to imagine any pundit in the American motion picture industry agreeing with Ms. Maslin's astounding assertion that "the idea that an X is bad for business only makes sense when it comes to big-budget films that are destined for multiple shopping malls."
As an independent film maker who has watched American independent film production dwindle to near extinction, thanks to the vertical integration of the Reagan era, I feel that the future of the American independent film is worthy of serious debate.

HEADLINE: Flood Tunnel Plan: A State-U.S. Split

BYLINE: By States News Service

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
A CONGRESSIONAL plan for a $1.2 billion tunnel to end flooding in New Jersey's Passaic River Basin has pitted Washington lawmakers against state legislators worried about costs and environmental impact.
New Jersey members of Congress, led by Representative Robert A. Roe, Democrat of Pompton Lakes, see the tunnel as the best plan to emerge from 50 years of debate over how to end chronic flooding in the Passaic River Basin. Flooding in the 10-county region has led to 29 deaths in this century -- five of them since 1983 -- and causes an average of $100 million in damage a year. 
 But state legislators say New Jersey cannot afford to pay its share of the cost -- at least $150 million over the next 10 to 20 years. State Senate and General Assembly members are considering a resolution that would ask the Army Corps of Engineers to study alternatives. And environmentalists have begun an aggressive campaign to block tunnel construction, which they say will destroy wetlands and deplete ground water in the region.
 
A Communication Gap
 The clash reflects a communication gap between Washington and New Jersey, with members of Congress asserting that tunnel opponents are misinformed, while critics say that members of Congress are out of touch with residents back home.
The tunnel debate also raises a broader question facing the Corps of Engineers as it enters the environmentally sensitive 1990's: Should the Government try to control nature or leave it alone?
"Either this flood tunnel is going to provide relief by the year 2000, if it ever gets built, or it is going to be the biggest mistake we've ever made," said State Assemblyman Gerald H. Zecker, Republican of Clifton. "I don't know."
The 20.1-mile tunnel, which would begin at Pompton Lakes, would carry floodwaters from the basin's upper reaches in southern New York State to a discharge point at Kearny Point on Newark Bay. The original design called for the pipe to funnel waters between dikes and levees at Nutley, but New Jersey's Federal lawmakers scrapped that plan after residents objected.
The tunnel's genesis dates to 1939, the first year that Congress authorized funds to study flooding in the Passaic River Basin. That same year, the Corps of Engineers proposed its first flood damage reduction plan. But that plan, like others proposed in 1948, 1962, 1969, 1972 and 1973, died because of public opposition. Like the criticisms today, the major objections were cost and environmental factors.
In 1976, Congress directed the corps yet again to study flooding in the basin. After reviewing more than 150 alternatives, the corps singled out 35 economically feasible plans, and in 1984 state officials selected the tunnel option for further development. Gov. Thomas H. Kean endorsed the plan formally in 1988.
After still more tinkering, task forces and public hearings, Congress authorized $890 million for the tunnel in the final hours of its session last month. The project was approved as part of a broader Water Resources Development Act and now needs only President Bush's signature to clear its last legislative hurdle in Washington. Congress also approved a financing measure in October that sets aside $5.8 million for tunnel design work in 1991.
Mr. Roe describes the plan as "an extraordinarily productive environmental program," saying that the tunnel bill protects 5,200 acres in a permanent "wetlands land bank." Mr. Roe also has the backing of Representatives Robert G. Torricelli, Democrat of Englewood, and Dean A. Gallo, Republican of Parsippany-Troy Hills. Senators Frank R. Lautenberg and Bill Bradley, both Democrats, also endorse the plan.
But environmentalists, led by the Passaic River Coalition, an anti-tunnel group, protest that construction will destroy up to 900 acres of freshwater wetlands that provide a sanctuary for North American plants and animals. Corps officials have promised to replace or revive the wetlands, but environmentalists say that such mitigation efforts are rarely successful.
"I say this project is going to be the geologic and the hydrologic equivalent of the Hubble Space Telescope -- a fiasco," said William Neil, assistant director of conservation at the New Jersey Audubon Society. "If we approve it and it goes through, we are going to have enormous regrets, environmentally and financially."
Environmentalists also fear that the tunnel will disrupt the river bottom and cut into ground-water recharge areas for North Jersey aquifers, threatening drinking water supplies for millions of residents. Critics said other major corps projects in the Mississippi Delta and the Florida Everglades had failed miserably.
In Florida, state and Federal officials estimate it will cost $93 million to $276 million to undo the environmental damage caused by a canal the corps dug through the Kissimmee River in 1971. The Tennessee Tombigbee Waterway, constructed in 1971 to provide inland navigation in Alabama and Mississippi, also has destroyed much of Louisiana's most fertile wetlands, Mr. Neil said.
"Nationally the corps is having a change of heart," said Mr. Neil, noting that the Government is moving away from large public works projects. "And that's why this project is such a dinosaur."
Corps officials counter that the tunnel does not compare with earlier projects, and that it complies with 1976 legislation establishing more stringent environmental guidelines.
Phyllis Kronick, a spokeswoman for the corps' Passaic River Division, said that state legislators' call for further study made little sense, since the corps examined 150 alternate flood control projects in the 1980's.
Department officials are now taking a fresh look at the project. Gov. Jim Florio is withholding judgment until Congress authorizes funds for actual tunnel construction. At that point, the state would be required to provide its share of the money.
 
Corps to Pay for Maintenance
 The tunnel will have no effect on ground water, said Ms. Kronick, who complained of "an enormous amount of misinformation" among residents. She said there were errors in literature disseminated by opponents of the project, including the claim that New Jersey will pay some $2.1 million a year in tunnel maintenance. In fact, the Water Resources Development Act now directs the corps to shoulder all maintenance costs.
"There's always fear," she said. "And unfortunately, the people who have been against the project have been very skillful at playing on those fears."
Beyond environmental concerns, however, many state legislators say New Jersey simply cannot afford the project. The state is technically responsible for 25 percent of the tunnel's $1.2 billion cost, or $300 million. But Mr. Roe said New Jersey would get credit for half that sum in exchange for lands donated to the project, bringing the state's share to $150 million.
"I see little or no hope of the state coming up with the funding to match the 25 percent share," said State Senator Gabriel M. Ambrosio, Democrat of Lyndhurst and author of the Legislature's resolution opposing the tunnel. "We just have other problems and other concerns that make this beyond our capacity to approve at this time."
Already mired in local tax and budget woes, state legislators believe that tunnel cost estimates are outdated and will dramatically rise during construction. A cheaper, more environmentally sound alternative, they argue, would be to buy out the estimated total of 744 homes in the floodway, at a cost of about $150 million.
"This is a particularly good time to undertake a buyout because of the decline in real-estate values throughout New Jersey," said Assemblyman Thomas J. Duch, Democrat of Garfield.
Tunnel advocates counter that a buyout would do little to protect residents from a 100-year flood -- a term used to describe a flood of major proportions -- like the 1903 "flood of record," which caused $1.9 billion in damage and killed 15 people. Flooding in April 1984 cost the state $370 million and forced the evacuation of 9,400 people.
 
Wide Displacement Seen
 An effective buyout would cost closer to $4 billion, the corps estimates, and displace virtually the entire town of Lincoln Park, to say nothing of streets, shopping centers and jobs.
"The buyout is environmentally the best alternative, but it has the serious problem that it would dislocate 50,000 families, result in the loss of thousands of jobs and cost between $3 billion and $4 billion," Mr. Torricelli said. "It simply is not economically viable."
<> <>
Moreover, many residents do not wish to leave the area, despite the risk of flooding. The state's last attempt at a buyout, in 1984, led to the sale of only 58 properties, which were not demolished for five years. Hundreds of residents have joined a pro-tunnel coalition called Protect, or the Passaic River Organizations to Encourage Construction of the Tunnel, which its chairman, Joseph B. Wiley, said has 10,000 people.
Herman Hy Nadel, a Republican Councilman in Lincoln Park, said: "Even if homes were purchased, you are taking people out of a community that they want to live in and displacing them. And that is ludicrous. This is their roots. This is their way of life."
 
'Most Frightening Moments'
 Tunnel advocates' most compelling argument comes from flood victims themselves. Marina Porter of Lincoln Park recalls the night in April 1984 when she was trapped in her home with three children under the age of 9. Mrs. Porter, whose husband had been unable to reach home, waited six hours for a rescue crew that arrived at 4 A.M. Meanwhile, the water in her basement rose to within two inches of her living room floor.
"Those were the most frightening moments I have experienced in my life," Mrs. Porter said. "We were taken in a small motorboat through the streets that I had driven down the previous morning -- except that all we could see of the streets were the tops of the street signs."
Mrs. Porter and her children wound up in a local elementary school with hundreds of other displaced families, and eventually returned home. But tunnel advocates note that some flood victims have not been so lucky.
"It's important to remember that people have been killed," Mr. Torricelli said. "In this decade, to lose lives in a suburban area like New Jersey to flooding is inexcusable. And it's not just the loss of lives. Millions of dollars in property also have been lost."
 
'A Very Powerful Force'
 Some tunnel opponents accuse Mr. Roe and others in Washington of pandering to construction and labor interests, which strongly endorse the plan.
"The pure economic, utilitarian argument for what this tunnel will bring is a very powerful force right now,"said Mr. Neil, of the New Jersey Audubon Society. He said the tunnel project would be the largest public works project ever built in the state.
Mr. Roe denied that jobs were his motivation for seeking the tunnel. The plan reflects decades of debate, he said, and has a long history of support from New Jersey governors before Mr. Florio.
"When you work on something for 30 years," Mr. Roe said, "it's obvious that you are not thinking of the job end of it."
 
'Agony People Go Through'
 Philip Beachem, executive vice president of New Jersey Alliance for Action, said of Mr. Neil's comment, "I don't think that the people who make those kinds of comments have spent time in a flood in that region, or have seen the agony that the people and families go through."
The alliance is a nonprofit coalition of government and business interests dedicated to infrastructure improvements.
If state officials kill the current tunnel plan, Mr. Beachem said, similar plans are not likely to arise. The project is on its third go-round in Congress, and tight Federal budgets are eroding support for major public works projects.
But environmentalists would not be sorry to see the tunnel go. They argue that the homes, shopping centers and businesses in the Passaic River Basin should not have been built there in the first place. Nature should be allowed to take its course, said Marie Curtis, a spokeswoman for the New Jersey Environmental Lobby.
"We see people constantly trying to improve on Mother Nature," she said. "And what we find is that we pay more in the end."

HEADLINE: New Airline Terminal Is a Hard-Won Victory

BYLINE: By JAMES FERON

 BODY:
ERIC LANGELOH, Westchester County's Commissioner of Transportation, has about two dozen architects' renderings in his office of proposed new terminals for the county's airport, right across the state line from Greenwich. The earliest drawing is "dated 1946, the year I was born," he said.
It may seem to Mr. Langeloh and other county officials that they have been dealing with the issue of a new airport terminal for most of their lives. 
 "You're looking at 45-odd years worth of people planning and arguing and debating," Mr. Langeloh said. "For it finally to get out to the public and for the public to say 'Yes, let's do it,' that's a major accomplishment."
Last week, in a $21 million bonding referendum, Westchester voters provided the go-ahead for a 41,000-square-foot replacement terminal. But just barely. The proposal was approved by a slender margin of 84,077 votes in favor and 79,587 against, or 51.37 percent to 48.63 percent.
 
What Happens Next
 The approval sets several events in motion, with the terminal's construction being the final, rather than the initial, accomplishment.
"Within 30 to 45 days," Mr. Langeloh said, "we'll be letting bids on the first phase, which is the access roadwork, an interior road system that will cost $5.7 million and represent a year's worth of work beginning next spring."
The road will be rebuilt from "where you currently pick up your parking ticket," he said. It will be redesigned, "so that you'll be able to go directly to the terminal for drop-offs or to a new parking structure," the second airport project.
The three-story, 1,200-space garage will be built for $17 million by a developer after public bids. That should be completed by the spring of 1992, when construction of the two-level terminal will begin. It should be in use by the spring of 1993.
The struggle against the proposed terminal, fought by elected officials and homeowner groups in nearby communities in both Connecticut and New York, dominated the final weeks of the election campaign.
Supervisor Donald B. Gioffre of Rye, N.Y., a leader in the effort to defeat the terminal plan, was diplomatic in defeat as he described the next stage of the struggle over what opponents still feel is an inevitable expansion of the airport. But he was still angry over the loss itself.
"Since the people have voted, it is only right to respect that vote," he said. "The county has offered to cooperate with us, so we will hold it accountable for its word that the terminal will cost only $21 million, that it will guarantee a continuation of the nighttime curfew, and that it will maintain a passenger cap of 234 passengers per half-hour."
 
A Reminder on a Pledge
 The county has also pledged to keep "larger and noisier planes away" from the airport, he said.
And finally, he said, "I hope we don't see the area around the new terminal magically transformed into additional apron space for aircraft."
Mr. Gioffre expressed bitterness about what he felt was a massive, government-financed campaign to enlist support for the referendum.
Peter W. Delaney, Westchester's General Services administrator, headed the campaign in support of the proposal under County Executive Andrew P. O'Rourke. Mr. Delaney said that $50,000 was raised privately and that $100,000 was spent by the county in supporting the referendum.
The $150,000 total was "absurdly low for at least four mailings, brochures and other material that appeared throughout the county," Mr. Gioffre said. "The Town of Rye spent $3,000 on one mailer, done by myself and others and mailed locally." Larger amounts were spent by others opposing the referendum.
Mr. Delaney conceded that unions, private businesses and others likely to benefit from a modernized airport were pressed into service to support the referendum.
 
'We Knew We'd Be Blitzed'
 "Those who opposed the referendum had an emotional issue on their side," Mr. Delaney said. "So we knew we had to win at least 65 percent of the vote outside the airport area, where we knew we'd be blitzed with 'no' votes. We barely made it."
Mr. Delaney said he and others in Westchester County government had "tried to talk the County Executive out of going to a referendum, but he felt he had no choice."
He recalled that Mr. O'Rourke said, "If we go to the people and do it right, we'll win and that will settle it."
 
Two Issues Faced Head-On
 Mr. Delaney said the narrow victory came about after "taking two issues head on: payment and expansion."
"We addressed the argument that it would cost more than the $21 million," he said, noting the county's position that increased revenues would more than cover the costs. The county campaign also disputed inferences that the terminal was a wedge to allow expanded operations at the airport.
Mr. Delaney said the county enlisted the help of pilots who use the airport, having them visit nursing homes and other places where the elderly congregate to persuade them of the referendum's benefits. "The elderly generally vote negatively on bond issues," he said.
 
Linking Airport to Jobs
 Corporate leaders were given placards and other visual material to display to their employees, "who were told that it was in their own best interests to support a more modern airport facility in Westchester," Mr. Delaney said. "We suggested that they link the economic vitality of their company with their employees' jobs."
Mr. Gioffre said he had no intention of initiating any legal process that would impede the airport project, but that he and others would carefully monitor the progress of the improvement plan.
Mr. Langeloh said the county, for its part, would work publicly on each stage of the program and would confer frequently with the county's Board of Legislators, which had requested an informal oversight role.

HEADLINE: After the Vote, Practicality May Temper Independence

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON

 BODY:
AFTER Lowell P. Weicker Jr.'s landmark victory last week, the political parties that he tore asunder began picking up the pieces. In just seven weeks, Mr. Weicker will become the state's first independent governor since Alexander H. Holly's election on the eve of the Civil War, and both Democrats and Republicans say they have little time to dwell on what might have been.
Mr. Weicker and the 187 members of the General Assembly -- most of whom opposed him, at least publicly, in the campaign -- will be thrown together, for better or worse, until the end of next year's legislative session. And while beautiful music may emerge from the union of a former United States Senator with a reputation for going his own way and a legislature full of people who had hoped to see someone else as governor, the initial prospects for harmony are dismal.
With unemployment and business bankruptcies rising, tax revenues falling and a recession apparently looming, Mr. Weicker will take office facing challenges that pale beside the questions about how effectively he will be able to govern as an independent.
The most immediate issue facing him is a state budget deficit that is projected to be about $400 million in the year that ends June 30. The projected shortfall in the next year could reach $1 billion or more in a budget of just over $7 billion. Between January and June, when the regular legislative session ends, those budget holes -- caused by the sharp falloff in tax revenues over the last year -- must be filled through spending cuts, tax increases or some combination. Legislative leaders say that almost all the options are unpleasant, and that under such a cloud, even a governor who had a majority party behind him in the General Assembly would see strife.
For Mr. Weicker, the era of initial good will that is expected between the new Governor and the legislators will probably be even more brief.
"The state of Connecticut is in such dire shape, I don't think the honeymoon can last long," said State Representative Edward C. Krawiecki Jr., a Republican from Bristol who is a deputy minority leader in the House.
State Representative Richard O. Belden, a Republican from Shelton who is also a deputy leader in his party, said of Mr. Weicker, "He's got to get moving."
Still, leaders of both parties insisted they would approach things with an open mind, bearing no grudges that could mire the budget debate in a battle of spite.
"I'm waiting to see exactly what happens," said the House Speaker, Representative Richard J. Balducci, a Democratic from Newington. "But I'm sure we are willing to sit and negotiate and do what is necessary. He is the man the people of the state have elected as Governor. We are going to have to work with him to the best of our ability."
Mr. Weicker, a 59-year-old former Republican Senator who was defeated in his bid for a fourth Senate term in 1988 by Joseph I. Lieberman, a Democrat, got only 40 percent of the 1.1 million votes cast in Tuesday's election. But with three main candidates, that was enough. The second-place finisher, United States Representative John G. Rowland, a Republican from Waterbury, got 37 percent, while the Democrat, United States Representative Bruce A. Morrison of Hamden, received just 21 percent. A fourth candidate, Joseph A. Zdonczyk of the Concerned Citizens Party, got 2 percent of the total.
The election crushed the hopes of the Republicans, who had seen themselves capitalizing on the deep decline in popularity of the Democratic incumbent, Gov. William A. O'Neill, who chose not to run for a third term. And it nearly crushed the Democratic Party. Had Mr. Morrison received 10,000 fewer votes, he would have dropped below the threshold, 20 percent of the votes cast, that would have relegated the Democrats to minor-party status under state law, equal to the Libertarians or the Socialist Workers. New Democratic candidates would have had to submit petitions just to get their names on the ballot.
 Democratic and Republican leaders said that communication will be vital to the relationship between the Weicker administration and the Democratic-controlled legislature. If Mr. Weicker at least tips his hand about his legislative agenda, the leaders said, some obstacles could be removed and some compromises reached without waging a full battle on every point.
In the legislative elections, the Democrats picked up one seat in the House of Representatives, raising their margin to 88 to 62. The Republicans picked up three seats in the Senate, narrowing the Democratic margin to 20 to 16.
 
Partisan Comments
 But no one expects the situation to be entirely painless. Whether an administration is headed by an independent or the truest party believer, partisan digs will still be part of the system.
On the day after the election, for example, Mr. Belden was asked at a State Capitol news conference whether he believed Mr. Weicker's proposals on the state budget would cause divisiveness in the Republican Party or in the State House of Representatives.
"I didn't realize he had taken a stand on that," Mr. Belden said with a deadpan expression.

BYLINE: Eleanor Charles

 BODY:

TRACY IS ON HIS WAY
 He was originally called "Plainclothes Tracy," but the fearless detective with the razor sharp profile and snap-brim fedora was renamed "Dick Tracy" when his creator, Chester Gould, sold the comic strip to the Chicago Tribune-Daily News Syndicate in 1931. The rest, as they say, is history, and it will be re-told in a comprehensive Dick Tracy Exhibition opening today through Feb. 24 at the Museum of Cartoon Art in Rye Brook.
 On loan from Matt Masterson, a pre-eminent Dick Tracy collector and old friend of the late Mr. Gould, are more than 80 of the original strip drawings. In them are at least 100 of the familiar characters with grotesque faces and names to match. They include Flattop, Pruneface, Measles, Gargles and Itchy, among others. Their fame and influence as mirrors of the American crime scene became so pervasive that Gould was pressured by his editors to tone down his depictions of torture, murder and depravity during the decade preceding his retirement in 1977.
 In addition to the artwork there will be a display of Dick Tracy toys, comic books, premiums, movie posters, dolls, figurines, games, puzzles, detective kits, trading cards and wrist radios -- all acquired by Larry Doucet and Bill Crouch, co-authors of a publication called "The Authorized Guide to Dick Tracy Collectibles." The two men will be guest speakers on Dec. 2 at 2 P.M.
 The museum, on Comly Avenue, one mile south of the King Street Exit of the Hutchinson River Parkway, is open Tuesdays through Fridays from 10 A.M. to 4 P.M., and Sundays from 1 to 5 P.M. Admission is $3 for adults; $2 for students and the elderly; and $1 for children. For more information, call 939-0234.
 
THE SCAPEGOAT
 A book by Aranka Siegal for young people, "Upon the Head of the Goat: A Childhood in Hungary, 1939-1944," won the Newbery Honor Book Award in 1982. Its contents provide the basis for her talk, "Learning Not to Scapegoat," to be delivered at a luncheon meeting of the Scarsdale Congregational Church Guild at noon Tuesday.
 In her book, published in Manhattan by Farrar, Straus, Giroux, Ms. Siegal recounted her experiences from the age of 13, when she was rounded up with her sister by the Nazis, separated permanently from the rest of her family and deported first to Auschwitz and then to Bergen-Belsen concentration camps. The two girls were rescued by the Swedish Red Cross and they emigrated to the United States in 1948.
 A passion for literature that led to her career as a writer was instilled when Ms. Siegal was 12 years old and the Nazi-controlled Hungarian Government banned Jewish children from attending the public schools. She compensated as much as she could by reading every book her family owned or that she could get otherwise.
 Now a Westchester mother of two grown children, she continues to write about children who must come to terms with their prejudices and understand the meaning of scapegoating. Admission to the luncheon is $3. Call 723-0430 or 723-2111 for reservations.
 
INSULATING TIPS
 Mildew, peeling paint, drafts and high heating and air-conditioning bills can all be signs of poor insulation and poor air circulation, which the Cornell Cooperative Extension of Westchester County can help eliminate.
 In two seminars this week, James McCarty, housing specialist in the department of design and environmental analysis at Cornell University, will discuss the theoretical aspects of the problem, the development of various products to assist homeowners and proper installation techniques that will insure long-term solutions.
 The first session is scheduled on Wednesday at 7:30 P.M. at 214 Central Avenue, White Plains. Call 682-3074 for reservations or more information. A second identical seminar will be held Thursday at 7:30 P.M. at Guideposts in Carmel. The phone number there is 628-0454. Admission to either program is $3.
 
THE NEWEST MUSEUM
 Can seven plugged-in television sets make a robot in the shape of a man? Yes, they can, and Nam June Paik made one this year. The piece is among more than 100 objects, paintings, sculptures, photographs, pieces of folk art and decorative art on display in "The Technological Muse," an exhibition opening today at 2 P.M. in the new Katonah Museum of Art.
 This inaugural show at 22 Jay Street, marks the former Katonah Gallery's move from its quarters in the village library to its own building, designed by Edward Larrabee Barnes. The 37-year-old institution will not keep a permanent collection, but will mount five major exhibitions a year.
 A sampling of the extraordinary range of material in the new show, spanning 150 years in all media, includes photographs of the Civil War; "Arms Chair," an upholstered easy chair by Paul Ludick decorated with a fringe of revolvers; a four-foot cadmium-yellow icebag by Claes Oldenburg; paintings by Winslow Homer; a 1915 piece by Marcel Duchamp called "Large Glass or the Bride Stripped Bare by Her Bachelors Even" in oils and wire on glass; and a 1906 "Little Nemo" newspaper cartoon strip by Winsor McCay.
 Every Sunday at 3:30 P.M. one of the artists featured in the exhibition will give a talk. Joseph Maresca is today's speaker. The museum is open free of charge Tuesdays through Fridays from 1 to 5 P.M., Saturdays from 10 A.M. to 5 P.M. and Sundays from 1 to 5 P.M. Docent tours are conducted at 2:30 P.M. Tuesdays, Thursdays and Sundays. Call 232-9555 for more information.
 
TRADING WITH ISRAEL
 "How to Succeed in Business With Israel" is the subject of a forum to be held from 8:30 A.M. to 2 P.M. Tuesday at the White Plains Hotel. Organized by the World Trade Club of Westchester, the Westchester County Office of Economic Development and the United States-Israel Economic Forum, the program will provide nuts and bolts advice from senior executives, government officials and legal experts on how to conduct trade with Israel.
 Among the speakers and panelists are Edward J. Borrazzo, president of Loral International of Yonkers; Shimon Bartzill, first vice president of Bank Leumi Trust Company of New York; Meir Buber, Consul and Trade Commissioner to the United States Trade Center of Israel, and Joseph E. Schoonmaker, vice president of Chase Manhattan Bank. Cheri Laustaunau, director of the Israel Information Center of the United States Department of Commerce, will deliver the keynote address.
 A $50 fee includes program materials, light breakfast and lunch. For reservations or more information, call 948-6444.
 
TAX STRATEGIES
 Julian Block will conduct a three-session course on "Saving Money: Tax Strategies for 1990" at the Center for Continuing Education in Mamaroneck High School, on Palmer Avenue from 8 to 10 P.M. Mondays beginning tomorrow.
 Mr. Block is a tax expert and author of several books on tax preparation. He has taught tax planning at the university level and he manages to reduce complicated tax laws into understandable language. (He has no connection with the H&R Block tax-preparation company.)
Tuition is $45, or $24.50 for people older than 65. Call 698-9126 to register or get more information.

HEADLINE: Campus Life: Mount Holyoke;
Students Rally To Overcome Discrimination

DATELINE: SOUTH HAD LEY, Mass.

 BODY:
Led by the As sociation of Pan-African Unity, the black student group on campus, several Mount Holyoke student organizations joined with college administrators in a rally on Friday calling for the college to acknowledge that discrimination exists on campus and to combat it.
"We must understand the distortion of what it means to be African-American, Hispanic or whatever minority, and to begin to learn from those distortions," Rochelle Calhoun, associate dean of students, told about 150 students, faculty members and administrators.
Echoing that call, Taifa Smith, a sophomore economics major from Philadelphia and a spokeswoman for the Association of Pan-African Unity, said, "We have to understand how people's actions affect different groups." 
 The rally was in response to an incident two weeks ago in which a male Hispanic visitor in Mead dormitory urinated on the door of two black women. It is unclear whether the incident was a result of racisim, sexism or was simply a drunken act. Dormitory residents who were witnesses, including the two women who were the hosts of the dormitory party the man had attended, denied knowing about the incident and did not assist campus security guards in their investigation.
 
 President Was Appalled
 At a student senate meeting last week and in a letter to the college community, President Elizabeth Kennan decried the incident and the students' response.
Saying that "the act in question was barbaric," Mrs. Kennan wrote: "The victims recognized racism through the incident and its immediate aftermath. Their floor-mates initially did not. Students in Mead by their own processes have come to understand that the evaluation of an event does not depend on intention alone. An act can be degrading, even destructive, to others whether or not it is intended to be so."
Mrs. Kennan added that "shared understanding and mutual action in defense of another's rights is a necessary part of our lives together."
At the Student Senate meeting, she also said that the college security department would determine how to prevent similar incidents in the future.
 
Said They Didn't Know
 Students, campus security workers and the dean of students office said the incident involved at least one Coast Guard Academy cadet. Mount Holyoke has not released the name of the student.
Students agreed that the cadet had been drinking at a post-party celebration in Mead. At about 2:30 A.M., he urinated on the door of Angela Lemond, a sophomore English and theater major from Spring, Tex., and her roommate, Angela Hull, a sophomore sociology major from Lewiston, Me. They were in their room at the time. When security officers tried to investigate, other residents of the dormitory floor said they had no information.
By about 3 A.M., the dormitory's head resident, who had been alerted by Ms. Lemond and Ms. Hull, was looking for the cadet when Holyoke students and the man's fellow cadets brought him forward. When questioned about his actions, the man became verbally abusive, students who witnessed the exchange said.
At a floor meeting that night, Ms. Lemond and Ms. Hull questioned why fellow residents had not come to their aid.
 
Why Didn't They Do Something?
 Ms. Calhoun, the associate dean, said that when the hosts of the post-party were questioned by the dean's office, they acknowledged that they had known what the cadet had done but, because he was the friend of a friend, they had not known whether they would be held responsible for his actions. Ms. Calhoun added that the students could not explain why they had done nothing when the cadet became verbally abusive to a fellow member of their dormitory.
The dean of students, Sheila Murphy, said in an interview that Mount Holyoke had complained to the Coast Guard Academy, and that the academy was investigating. Ms. Murphy said that academy officials had told her that the cadet had been involved in other incidents and had been restricted to campus. By coming to Mount Holyoke, he had violated that restriction, she said.
The cadet's hosts, by witholding information from security officers, violated Mount Holyoke's social honor code, and disciplinary action has been taken against them, the dean's office said. The office of the dean of students said that the discipline involved community service.
Mead dormitory has announced that it will conduct workshops this week to deal with issues raised by the incident. "We need to address the issue that there is racism on Mount Holyoke's campus," Ms. Lemond said. "It can only be dealt with if people are open."

HEADLINE: MARKET WATCH;
Joking Aside, Maybe It's Just a Yuppie Recession

BYLINE: By Floyd Norris

 BODY:
INVESTMENT bankers are being laid off.
That fact may not strike terror into the hearts of middle America. It may even seem encouraging to some who associate the hordes of suspender-clad young M.B.A.'s with the financial excesses of the 1980's that left the economy fragile and businesses unable to pay their bills.
But on Wall Street, there are few things as horrifying, and not just because of the suspicion it will be difficult to train such people for productive work. The old joke, about a recession meaning your neighbor is out of work and a depression arriving when you lose your job, may help to explain the dismal economic forecasts now pouring from brokerage houses.
If so, then perhaps there is reason to hope that all is not as bad as it seems, that, as Prudential Bache's Ed Yardeni puts it, "to a large extent, this is a yuppie recession" that won't have a cataclysmic effect everywhere else in America, even if the New York economy is in for a rough spell.
One measure of Wall Street's mood is in the earnings estimates issued by brokerage house analysts. Since Iraq invaded Kuwait and recession woes started to escalate, analysts have been vying with each other to see how fast they can slash forecasts. In October, reports Rick Pucci of Institutional Brokerage Estimate System, an index of earnings estimates for companies in the S.&P. 500 showed that for every estimate raised, almost four were lowered. The ratio, of 0.26, was down sharply from September's 0.39.
Mr. Pucci sees hope in those figures, simply because the analysts, as a group, have a record of being wrong whenever they are so unanimous. In the decade that the statistic has been kept, the only other times the index got so low were in July 1982 and January 1985. In the first case, the bull market of the 1980's was about to begin; in the second, the first significant correction of that bull market had just ended. On the other hand, it was up to 1.49 in August 1987, just before the crash.
That is not the only reason to hope that, in the stock market at least, the worst is over. Renewed hopes for Fed easing played a role in Friday's rally, which almost offset earlier weakness and left the Dow Jones industrial average down just 2.23 points for the week, to 2,488.61.
"If the Fed really is coming around now to recognizing that the economy is falling into a recession, we'll have a big drop in interest rates that I think will revive consumer spending by the first quarter," said Mr. Yardeni. "The recession is almost over." He thinks stocks and bonds can advance even if the real estate market remains depressed for several years.
Long-term interest rates have been declining, but not as much as might have been expected, given the dramatic rally since the end of September in the Dow Jones utility average, which has a reputation as a leading indicator of bond prices. But last week that index slipped 2.6 percent, giving back a third of the advance.
If the utilities do not start moving up again, the hopes for the entire market may be premature.

HEADLINE: Coaxing the Stanford Elephant to Dance

BYLINE: By GLENN KRAMON

DATELINE: STANFORD, Calif.

 BODY:
NOURISHED over the years by affluent and well-insured patients, the Stanford Medical Center has expanded in the past decade from a single large building into a leading example of what some health-care experts call the medical-industrial complex. It now covers an area almost as large as the adjacent century-old central campus of Stanford University. And bulldozers and cranes are still roaring, at work on new laboratories and a new children's hospital.
 The setting seems far removed from the financial woes of inner-city hospitals and indeed much of the rest of the nation. Nearby houses commonly sell for $700,000, even in the current real estate slump. Across the street from the hospital is a tony shopping center with a Saks, Neiman-Marcus and Nordstrom. So exclusive is the area that, as one young doctor put it, "an internist's salary is becoming a second income -- you can't live on it." 
 Yet amid this extraordinary prosperity and even as the new buildings rise, the financial foundation of this big medical complex is showing serious signs of cracking. The chief reason is that cost-containment pressure by medical insurers has begun to take hold with a vengeance. It came first from the Government, which has limited payments for Medicare and Medicaid patients as it tries to reduce its deficit. Now it is coming as well from insurance companies and from private employers, which ultimately pay medical bills for almost everyone else, and are balking at the rapidly rising cost. The insurers are issuing this warning: Offer competitive prices or we will provide financial incentives for the people we cover to go elsewhere for treatment.
 Private health insurers in big California cities are at the forefront of this new cost-cutting drive, but similar efforts are under way in areas as diverse as Minneapolis, Phoenix, Denver and Washington.
 "What you're seeing in California and the San Francisco area is an advanced case of what's coming to the rest of the country," said Charles O. Schetter, of the health-care practice at McKinsey & Company, consultants, in Los Angeles. "As costs continue to rise but payers get smarter and smarter at managing medical costs, the inevitable squeeze will force hospitals to adapt how they're operating."
 
Some Hard Questions
 These developments are forcing some soul-searching questions: Can a medical center, particularly one so important to teaching and research, be treated as just another supplier? Will academic institutions like Stanford, which find it especially hard to compete on price because of their higher costs, lose patients to other hospitals and doctors? And will they therefore come up short in their roles as leaders in the advancement of medicine? Or have such hospitals indeed expanded too quickly and become bloated and badly in need of the discipline of a business?
 Stanford is now, in fact, attempting to behave in a more businesslike fashion. It is moving to cut expenses, to lower fees, to offer and market new treatment programs and to improve service as never before. To focus on the task, the hospital has brought in Kenneth D. Bloem, who came from the University of Chicago last fall with a reputation for turning around a financially troubled medical institution.
Mr. Bloem, who is 44 years old, likens the pressure on Stanford and other medical centers to that on airlines and banks in the past decade. "The climate is very tough," he said. "It's an industry perceived to have overcapacity -- that is, excess beds and a surplus of physicians. It's a buyer's market."
He outlined Stanford's strategy this way: "To find areas of inefficiency or duplication, to eliminate costs associated with them, and with the savings to strengthen existing programs and invest in new programs that are best mounted by a top research institution, programs that bring advances as quickly as possible from the bench to the bedside. This will allow us to better compete for patients."
 The sharp cost-cutting at the hospital began in earnest in April. The hospital eliminated 384 jobs, as part of an effort to reduce its $320 million annual budget by about $30 million. The layoffs cut 17 percent of management positions and 9 percent of staff positions -- among them, nurses, technicians, clerks, secretaries and marketing people.
 Administrators concede Stanford and others like it share some of the blame for the budget strains they are under. Before the price of health care reached its current crisis levels, these institutions added layers of employees and operated their programs with a rather lofty inattention to costs. Reputation, it was assumed, would bring in the patients.
 In trying to adjust to the current fiscal demands, great teaching and research institutions like Stanford have more at stake than others.
On one level, the medical center is just a business. Its hospital, clinic and medical school had revenues of about half a billion dollars this year.
But on a higher plane, it is more than that: Stanford claims the first successful heart-lung transplant, the first synthesis of biologically active DNA in a test tube and the first report of successful use of proteins called monoclonal antibodies to treat cancer. Just two weeks ago, Stanford doctors transplanted part of a mother's lung to save her dying 12-year-old daughter. A recent survey of 400 doctors by U.S. News and World Report ranked Stanford as one of the best in cancer, cardiology, otolaryngology and pediatrics.
 
Where It Will Hurt
 "To the extent that it suffers financially, its research and education programs will ultimately suffer," said David G. Anderson, a principal at APM, a New York consulting firm.
 More layoffs are expected, and some doctors and nurses there are worried. "My concern is that the cuts are being made in the wrong place, like a surgeon making an incision on the wrong side of the body," said Dr. Norman Shumway, Stanford's most prominent heart surgeon. "They should be cutting out more of the middle-management core."
 Donalda Dunnett, a representative of the nurses' union at Stanford, acknowledged that the medical center's administrators have tried hard to help the nurses. But, she said, "The nurses think the cuts have made it more difficult for them to deliver the quality of care they're accustomed to." She worries about response time in routine cases, and emergencies.
 The cost-cutting pressure from private and public insurers is all the more difficult for Stanford Medical Center because it is a private, nonprofit institution that receives no tax money and must rely almost exclusively on patient revenues, tuition, gifts and research grants. What is more, the Government is pressing Stanford to reduce what it charges for overhead costs, like the use of campus buildings, in Federally financed research projects.
Like many academic medical centers, Stanford is saddled with a high proportion of patients who have no health insurance at all, people who come from far beyond the wealthy Palo Alto area on the assurance that the university hospital feels an obligation to care for them.
In addition, even those with state-Federal Medicaid insurance are now costing Stanford a fortune, according to medical center figures.
Stanford reported losses of $200 a day this summer on Medicaid patients. And that did not include administrative costs and debt obligations, which account for about half of total costs, said David S. P. Hopkins, director of corporate affiliations and policy. All told, Stanford reported providing $44.8 million in uncompensated care in 1989.
 
The Ills of Medicaid
 As California and the Federal Government negotiate harder bargains, a growing number of other hospitals and doctors are steering away from Medicaid patients. "None of us will see those patients anymore," said an internist in the Stanford area who spoke on condition that he not be identified. "The only thing we can do to make sure they get care is to dump them on Stanford." The number of Stanford's patients on Medicaid (or Medi-Cal, as it is called in California) has risen 35 percent in two years to 27 percent of all patients. Stanford is now moving to limit the number of uninsured and Medicaid patients it accepts from distant areas.
Like other medical centers, Stanford is also faring worse with Medicare, for people 65 and older or disabled. The Government has limited what it will pay for all kinds of treatment, and even stiffer limits seem likely. All told, the collection rate for Stanford physicians on Medicare, Medi-Cal and indigent patients is now about 63 cents on each dollar billed, down from 80 cents five years ago, said Donald B. Tower, executive director of the Stanford clinic.
<> <> Hospitals and doctors have historically compensated for losses on the poor and the elderly by raising rates for those covered under private insurance plans paying the full price.
 It is this practice that private insurers are now fighting, using their large size to press for discounts. "Employers like Hewlett-Packard are becoming sophisticated health-care consumers and aggressive contractors," said Donald Kennedy, president of the university and chairman of the hospital board. "They can shop around and move their patients."
 Given this climate, "we have hardly any full-paying patients left -- only about 18 or 19 percent," Mr. Tower said of the Stanford clinic. With so few patients left to pay full price, Stanford has sharply increased fees for those who still do. Undiscounted room rates jumped 23 percent in 1989 and 14 percent the year before.
 Other hospitals in the area have a similar problem. But Stanford's teaching and research and consequent larger staff all contribute to even higher overhead. As a result, "other hospitals can beat you on price," Mr. Kennedy said. A room in a Stanford surgical ward this summer cost $583 to $1,226 a day, compared with $500 to $650 at competitors.
 Like many academic medical centers, Stanford falls victim to its own raison d'etre: training new doctors through its medical school. Many graduates set up shop in competing hospitals, clinics or free-standing surgery centers. "Stanford is expert at transferring expertise to people who then compete with it, but at lower prices," said Sheldon King, president of the Cedars Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles and a former president of the Stanford hospital.
 
 Growth of Competition
 Perhaps the most conspicuous example has been the cardiac-surgery program established by Dr. Shumway and others when the hospital opened at Stanford in 1959. "At that time, there was no cardiac surgery between San Francisco and Los Angeles," Dr. Shumway recalled. "But when coronary-artery surgery, a relatively simple operation, became more common in the 70's, a lot of our surgeons went off to neighboring hospitals and became millionaires, taking with them a lot of the patients who used to come to Stanford."
So Stanford loses many of its bread-and-butter cases -- not only heart surgery but also gall-bladder removals, simple births and other common operations. And it is left with the costlier, more unpredictable ones for which competing hospitals might not be equipped -- like emergency cases of multiorgan failures.
 Complicating Stanford's predicament is that in the San Francisco area, medical networks, like the huge Kaiser Permanente program, are more popular than almost anywhere else in the country. These health maintenance organizations are using low rates and improving reputations to steal the income-producing insured patients from Stanford in a big way.
To win back some of that business, Stanford too must offer discounts -- directly to employers or through contracts with H.M.O.'s. Stanford is also being pushed into keeping more patients out of the hospital or to shorten their stays. So the patients who do qualify for hospital stays are sicker on average than they used to be -- and more costly to care for.
<> <> With so much lower-priced competition, and with the new emphasis on using hospitals less, Stanford, for all its prestige, is actually now finding itself strapped for patients. Twenty-five years ago the hospital was so full that doctors fought for operating rooms. Today, 25 percent to 30 percent of its 663 beds are empty.
This has a direct effect on the ledger. Five years ago, net revenues from operations exceeded expenses by $17 million. A loss of $14 million was projected for the fiscal year ended Aug. 31, but the budget cuts reduced it to $1 million. This fiscal year, a $2.4 million loss on operations is projected. Doctors at the center's outpatient clinic are being squeezed as well.
 In such an environment, Stanford has found it increasingly difficult to attract talented faculty physicians, the kind who bring medical advances and impart wisdom to the 1,900 students, postdoctoral fellows, interns and residents at the medical center.
 
Specialty Care
 Trying to increase its base of patients, Stanford is beefing up in areas in which local hospitals would find it difficult to compete -- planning to add transplants of the kidney, liver and pancreas, for example. It is expanding its pain-management center and establishing a psychiatric unit, and will consolidate its pediatric programs in the new children's hospital.
 But price matters too. This summer, Stanford raised its room rates 6 percent more, but the increase was well under the rate of medical-cost inflation. In the spring, it opened a post-operation recovery unit with beds at a far lower daily rate than in other wards. It has also opened a lower-priced unit for patients awaiting placement in a nursing home.
 Even with such offerings, Stanford will not attract enough patients unless more doctors start referring them. So it has recently begun to hire doctors whose main focus is patient care and teaching, as opposed to laboratory research, in the hope that they will bring in badly needed business. The medical center has also increased financial incentives for faculty physicians to see patients.
 Stanford is also working on its reputation for service, Mr. Bloem said. And it is joining other hospitals in seeking to reverse the trend of lower reimbursement for Medi-Cal and Medicare patients, and in pressing for coverage of people now uninsured.
 Still, Stanford's administrators agree that America's hospitals must become more businesslike. Otherwise, their more esteemed medical mission will fail. And that would be a tragedy, for an oft-forgotten reason: Medical advances, like the coming cures for severe disorders caused by flawed genes, can in many cases not only improve or save a life but also significantly lower the cost of health care. Mr. Kennedy acknowledges that many factors figure in cutting hospital costs. But he emphasized: "Only if the most innovative institutions survive will we eventually take medicine to a more cost-effective level."
 
 
 
SOCKING IT TO THE INSURED
 LIKE most hospitals, Stanford Medical Center plays the game that medical economists call cost shifting. The numbers are startling.
In round figures, it goes like this: When Stanford has to perform a Caesarean section on a poor patient with no health insurance, it does so and records a loss of, say, $3,000. If Medicaid chips in, the loss may shrink to $1,500 and if the woman is covered by some private insurance, at a discount, the loss may be only $500.
Now, the key move: A fully insured woman -- no discounts involved -- is given a bill of $12,000 for a Caesarean that cost Stanford $7,000. This makes up for the $5,000 loss on the other patients.
The more expensive the operation, the higher the stakes. For, say, a $39,000 triple bypass, the insurance company of a nondiscount patient is billed $80,000.
 
THE PRIVATE-SECTOR SQUEEZE
 MANY employers, concerned about medical costs, now offer their workers financial and other incentives to choose doctors and hospitals that agree to a lower price. For example, for employees in certain areas, the Hewlett-Packard Company will cover 90 percent of the cost of an operation at a hospital with which it has negotiated a discount, but only 70 percent at other places, like Stanford, where it has not. Employees are protected by a cap of $1,250 on what they must pay for medical care in a year, but their out-of-pocket expenses can rise by hundreds of dollars if they opt for lower coverage.
What is more, Hewlett-Packard, like many employers, now provides incentives beyond money: "We give our employees a list of doctors and hospitals and tell them that we have selected them based not only on price but on quality of care," said Susan D. Moriconi, Hewlett-Packard's health-benefits manager. "And we know that our employees hate the paperwork of medical bills, so the providers take care of that."
Employers have particularly strong leverage in negotiating a favorable price in the Stanford area because competition for patients is rife. The Bay Area has more physicians per capita than almost any other area. And "every local hospital has expensive technology," said David Korn, dean of the Stanford Medical School.

HEADLINE: World Markets;
Lessons From the 20-Year Averages

BYLINE: By Jonathan Fuerbringer

 BODY:
IN this bear market, one place to look for guideposts is history. A sharp-eyed student of past market behavior just might find some clues to the time when stocks, whose long-term values have been enhanced by the sharp drop in prices, will be real bargains again.
Goldman Sachs International Ltd. of London, led by Jeffrey M. Weingarten, its chief strategist, recently conducted such an exercise by reviewing market statistics going back 20 years. Goldman's conclusion, based on market levels at the end of October, was that stocks are still overvalued. Only when the markets decline a further 15 percent, the Goldman researchers said, would bargains reappear. 
 The Goldman forecast offers a very cautious approach for investors at a time when war jitters in the Middle East and the increasingly uncertain outlook for the world's economy make investing in stocks even riskier than usual.
To be sure, Goldman could have chosen a smaller slice of history as its guide -- specifically, the bullish 1980's -- and reached a much more sanguine conclusion: that stocks may be attractive right now. But it rejected that approach because it felt the decade's climb was an unrepresentative episode.
In any event, the slide in world stock markets in the last two weeks -- representing a drop on average of 3 percent -- has already accounted for some of the decline that the Goldman researchers said was needed for a turnaround, making the negative picture they painted look less bleak.
This latest fall in stock prices, which followed a sharp rally in October, is the second swing down in the wake of the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in August. The markets in Italy, Norway and Sweden have fallen to new lows for the year and others, including Japan, Germany and Spain, are nearing new troughs.
A revived threat of a war with Iraq, and the higher oil prices that that fear engenders, have had much to do with the new slump. The feisty words of British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher to Parliament on Wednesday intensified the war fears. On Thursday, the Bush Administration announced plans to add about 150,000 troops to the forces gathered in Saudi Arabia, giving the United States the option of launching an attack against the Iraqis rather than just defending against one.
The stronger draft of an economic downturn has also had its impact. October employment figures in the United States signaled a weaker economy and made a recession seem even more likely. Forecasts for Europe and Japan, where growth is still expected, have been reined in. And each week seems to bring another round of downward revisions in earnings forecasts.
Goldman's analysis, pegged to market levels on Oct. 24, uses several measures, including price/earnings ratios and dividend yield, to determine whether stock markets are overvalued or undervalued. Stocks become attractive again when they are undervalued. Using averages for these and other measures over the last 20 years, the Goldman researchers concluded that the major markets around the world, except for Italy, were still too expensive.
In Japan, the average price/earnings ratio was 46.5 percent higher than the 20-year average. The ratio was also higher in the United States (by 22.2 percent), the Netherlands (14.1 percent), Britain (3.2 percent) and Switzerland (2.1 percent). Overall, the markets were about 14 percent overvalued, excluding Japan, whose traditionally overvalued stocks push the world average to 37 percent.
The comparison of dividend yields produced a similar conclusion.
But the slide in prices in the last two weeks has made some of the valuations look better. Using P/E ratios and dividend yields through Thursday, Japan dropped to an overvaluation of 36.6 percent and the Netherlands to 8.5 percent; Switzerland actually showed an undervaluation of 2.8 percent. And dividend yields in six of the eight countries studied are now better than, or equal to, the 20-year average. Two weeks ago, only three were better than the average.
Using 1982 to 1989 as the base period makes a turnaround seem already at hand. Except for the United States and the Netherlands, all the P/E ratios become undervalued, for example.
Goldman rejected this analysis, however. "We feel the 80's were an abnormal period of equity performance and so it is not a good base," said Paul Feldman, a Goldman strategist.
But that does not mean that such figures won't be used by others arguing that it is time to jump back into stocks.
Mr. Feldman acknowledged that the latest market decline has improved the dismal picture that came from using a 20-year base period.
But given the risky situation in the Persian Gulf and the shaky outlook for the economy, Mr. Feldman said he could not lift the caution flag just yet. Still needed, he said, are signs that the economy is "looking right again" and reliable numbers that show stock market prices are clearly cheap again.
"I don't think that will be that far off," he said. "Maybe nine months away."

HEADLINE: The Spinoff Stratagem

BYLINE: By BARNABY J. FEDER

DATELINE: WALTHAM, Mass.

 BODY:
THOUGH analysts may be impressed with how rapidly the Thermo Electron Corporation has been growing, George N. Hatsopoulos has a more ambitious perspective. Thermo Electron's founder and chief executive believes his 36-year-old company would be a $7 billion business, roughly 10 times its current size, if he had been running it in Japan instead of here in suburban Boston.
Mr. Hatsopoulos envies the access Japanese executives enjoy to cheap capital for investment in new ventures. Not only are Japanese interest rates lower, but Japanese companies are able to raise money by selling their stock at prices that Americans would regard as wildly inflated.
"A new venture here has to have twice the rate of return it would need in Japan to pay off," grumbled Mr. Hatsopoulos recently. 
 If any executive in American industry has demonstrated how to brood constructively rather than cower in the face of such discrepancies, it is Mr. Hatsopoulos, a 63-year-old Greek immigrant who has fashioned Thermo Electron into an unusual mini-conglomerate of high-technology businesses. A sampling of the Thermo product family: small power plants that burn agricultural waste; trucks designed to incinerate petroleum-soaked soil; bomb detectors; more than 100 types of instruments to monitor environmental contamination; dressings for wounds, and gas-fired air conditioners.
The common theme for most Thermo products is that they represent gambles on innovative technology to attack potentially huge markets in socially important areas, like the environment. Lately, the company has been bouncing from success to success while many of its more famous neighbors in the high-tech corridor surrounding Boston report slumping earnings. On Thursday, it reported that earnings in the quarter ended Sept. 29 rose 35 percent, to $9.5 million, while revenues jumped more than 27 percent, to $181 million.
A mechanical engineer by training who taught thermodynamics courses at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology during the company's early years, Mr. Hatsopoulos began worrying about the cost of capital nearly a decade ago. Thermo Electron stumbled into an earnings downturn as recession gripped the country, but Mr. Hatsopoulos wanted to forge ahead with investments in a number of technologies he believed would become useful for dealing with the world's energy and environmental problems. And he wanted to do it without borrowing heavily.
Mr. Hatsopoulos, who cultivates a wide circle of influential friends in government, industry and academia as part of his effort to anticipate business opportunities, delved so deeply into capital formation issues that he eventually became recognized as one of corporate America's leading experts on the subject. In 1982, he joined the board of the Federal Reserve Bank in Boston and served a two-year stint as its chairman that ended last year.
"I learned some things from him, and I never had a quicker student," said Lawrence H. Summers, the Harvard economist, who was one of the first experts Mr. Hatsopoulos turned to for help. "Today, he's right at the research frontier in this field and in a better position than most academics to say where theory meshes with experience."
THE research also led Mr. Hatsopoulos and his younger brother John, the company's chief financial officer, to gradually invent Thermo Electron's unique corporate structure. Starting in 1983, Thermo Electron has repeatedly set up pieces of the company as separate businesses and sold anywhere from 10 percent to 40 percent or so of their shares to institutional investors or the public at large. The goal was to give investors a chance to bet directly on the development of various pieces of Thermo Electron's broad technology base and to establish a clear market value for the strongest subsidiaries, which in turn raises the value of Thermo Electron shares.
"Spinning off some of our best divisions gives investors a simple picture," said Mr. Hatsopoulos.
It also allowed Thermo Electron to give managers stock options in their businesses, an incentive that is widely recognized as a heady stimulant for most executives. In addition, the option packages have helped Thermo Electron recruit and hang on to talented executives who wanted to run their own show. And dealing with outside shareholders helps groom potential successors for the top jobs in the company, according to Mr. Hatsopoulos, who says he hopes to stay at the company's helm another 10 years.
About 850 of the company's 5,000 employees are in various option plans and 95 percent of all employees are shareholders, according to John Hatsopoulos. The company has to grow to make those investments attractive because George Hatsopoulos is dead set against paying dividends.
Thermo Electron's spinoff strategy is by no means unique. Waste Management Inc., for example, won applause on Wall Street for selling 20 percent of its hazardous waste handling subsidiary, Chemical Waste Management Inc., to the public. But no company has taken the strategy as far as Thermo Electron.
THERMO ELECTRON's publicly traded subsidiaries currently include: Thermo Instrument Systems Inc., a leading supplier of environmental monitoring equipment, as well as engineering and testing services; Thermo Process Systems Inc., which makes high-temperature metal treatment equipment and waste incinerators; Tecogen Inc., which makes gas-fired equipment ranging from experimental auto engines to energy-saving air conditioners marketed by the Carrier Corporation and small-scale cogeneration systems that simultaneously generate electricity and steam heat, and Thermedics Inc., which makes a number of medical products and has been a pioneer in the development of supersensitive devices to detect explosives and drugs.
Through Thermedics, Thermo Electron also controls Thermo Cardiosystems Inc., which makes implantable pumps that keep damaged hearts beating regularly until patients can receive transplants, and Universal Voltronics Inc., which makes equipment to convert electricity supplied by utilities to currents and voltages used in industrial and military tasks with unusual power needs.
The next Thermo "pup," as analysts call the spinoffs, is likely to be Thermo Energy Systems Inc., which makes other cogeneration equipment, waste heat recovery systems and power plants fueled by alternate energy sources like agricultural wastes. Thermo Electron sold a 10 percent stake in Thermo Energy to institutional investors in Europe last summer for $8.5 million and hopes to have a public offering next spring.
The private placement reflected the strong following the company has built up overseas as part of its effort to court longterm investors. Well over 80 percent of the debt of Thermo and its spinoffs is potential equity, in the form of debentures that are convertible into stock in the parent company or the various spinoffs, and more than half the convertible debt has been placed in Europe. Foreign investors now hold 35 percent of the parent company's shares, according to John Hatsopoulos.
The Thermo spinoffs account for more than two-thirds of the company's sales. The most obvious drawback of the strategy is that accounting costs and other administrative expenses are relatively high, reflecting the extra filings required by the Securities and Exchange Commission and multiple annual reports. Each company has its own board of directors, but making sure that all dealings between the subsidiaries are fair to each company's shareholders is no mean feat.
"We don't make one move without the blessing of the legal department," said John Hatsopoulos.
The strategy also results in frequent profits from stock sales that make earnings look stronger than the actual results from the operating companies. At times, some analysts believe, investors have bid the price of the company up higher than its operating achievements warrant.
"But Thermo has a relatively low degree of risk for a high-tech company," said Otis Bradley, who follows the company and its offspring for H. C. Wainwright & Company, a Boston brokerage. "They have always had a fetish about maintaining a strong balance sheet. And they seem to get a strong market position in almost everything they do."
THE spinoff strategy has led some observers to describe Thermo Electron itself as a venture capital holding company, a research and development firm, or, in the word's of one analyst, a "perpetual idea machine." Such views square with Mr. Hatsopoulos's track record of pursuing many intriguing-sounding concepts in the belief that a few will become commercially successful enough to compensate for the disappointments.
Thermo Electron existed in its early years entirely on research contracts from government agencies and industry groups like the Gas Research Institute. Last year, more than half of Thermo Electron's $45 million research budget was financed by outside sources.
But Mr. Hatsopoulos's goal is to lead a multibillion-dollar company. With that in mind, the company sticks to projects where it can retain the right to commercialize the results.
"We have been working 25 years on artificial heart projects that we expect to bear fruit in the next three years, but the $70 million that has been spent was N.I.H. money," said Mr. Hatsopoulos, referring to the Federally funded National Institutes of Health. "That's the advantage of working on socially important technologies."

HEADLINE: Wall Street;
A Well-Informed Lucky Break

BYLINE: By Diana B. Henriques

 BODY:
THE Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and some very astute investors do not see eye to eye on when to buy and sell banks.
At today's depressed levels, the shares of some major banks are starting to attract some notable bargain-hunters, including Warren Buffett, the legendary chairman of Berkshire Hathaway in Omaha, and the Loews Corporation, the corporate flagship of the savvy Tisch family in New York. 
But in this buyer's market, the F.D.I.C. is selling. Specifically, the agency is selling its stake in the Bank of Oklahoma, which it bailed out in 1986. Despite the current grim market for banks and an auction that featured a bit more uncertainty than seems necessary, the F.D.I.C. last month agreed to sell its stake in the bank for $61 million.
The price was close to the bank's book value and, although it was less than half the $130 million the agency invested in the bailout, it was far higher than anyone expected. A lucky break? Well, the successful bid was submitted by George B. Kaiser, an astute Tulsa oilman who served on the bank's board of directors, headed its audit committee and is familiar with the bank and its market. Clearly, Mr. Kaiser thinks he got a bargain. Which suggests that the F.D.I.C. -- and, thus, the public -- might not have.
Like many banks in the oil patch, the Bank of Oklahoma blossomed in the heady days of the late 1970's. In 1984, BancOklahoma Corporation, the bank's parent, doubled its gamble on the state's giddy economy by reaching beyond its Tulsa base to buy Fidelity Bank in Oklahoma City -- just as the boom disintegrated. Oil prices fell, natural gas prices fell and, soon, real estate prices and local payrolls fell. "Loan delinquencies, bankruptcy filings and mortgage foreclosures rose to unprecedented levels," the parent company recalled in a recent proxy report. The holding company's stock plummeted.
By 1986, the Oklahoma City bank was in danger of failing. In November that year, the F.D.I.C. propped it up with the $130 million in assistance. As part of that package, the Oklahoma City bank was merged with the Tulsa bank, with the agency getting preferred shares convertible into a 99.99 percent ownership stake in the merged institution. The remaining sliver of equity was left to BancOklahoma shareholders.
Unfortunately, the rescued bank did not live happily ever after. The local economy continued to decline and the bank undertook the bitter task of winnowing new problems from its portfolio and bolstering its reserves. It fell into arrears on its preferred share dividends and on loans from other banks. Last year, it managed to restructure its debts, with its creditor banks agreeing to new terms and the F.D.I.C. agreeing not to convert its preferred shares into common shares until at least March 1990.
But the Federal agency declined to hold onto those shares until the bank could benefit from the restructuring. As the market for bank shares sagged, it sought bids for its stake. And after ruminating a bit, Mr. Kaiser decided to submit one. He resigned from the BancOklahoma board last January and submitted his bid in August.
The bid's size surprised even the top executives of the bank, although the bank has been profitable since its restructuring and its loan portfolio is growing steadily healthier. "This is a much higher amount than anyone thought he would pay," said Leonard J. Eaton, chairman and chief executive. "But obviously, this is the dominant banking franchise in the state of Oklahoma. If it continues its progress, the potential is there for profit."
Mr. Kaiser says that his bid was "about 50 percent community concern." He explained, "We need a locally concerned bank. But obviously, I would not enter into the transaction if I didn't think it would be profitable." He thinks the Oklahoma economy is turning around and that real estate values are low enough to attract cost-conscious businesses even in a recession.
Mr. Kaiser conceded that his optimism is based partly on his intimate knowledge of the bank he is buying. "I suppose I was more comfortable with the Bank of Oklahoma because of my familiarity with the institution," he said. But he noted that other potential bidders had access to ample information throughout the bidding process.
One piece of information, however, was not available to any bidder, including Mr. Kaiser. Federal bank examiners visited the bank during the bid period, but their findings were not available before the bid deadline in August. Although the regulators apparently found no new skeletons, the timing may have clouded the bidding. "I think there's no question that, given the 'reg-phobia' of a lot of people in the industry, that added a lot of uncertainty," said Mr. Eaton. "I know that it was a major consideration for at least one potential bidder."
The F.D.I.C. refused to comment on the auction's timing, and Mr. Kaiser said he did think he would have faced more competition in the bidding if the report had been available, or if the agency had waited to sell until the current anti-bank hysteria subsides.
In any case, Mr. Eaton and others associated with the bank agree that Mr. Kaiser's price is a very good one, even if a better one might have been possible later. And rather than taking the bank private, as he once planned, Mr. Kaiser will offer some sort of equity stake for holding company shareholders. Any deal that emerges from those negotiations, of course, will reflect the current depressed price of the company's stock, despite Mr. Kaiser's faith in the bank's future.
"I guess the F.D.I.C. just decided it wanted to sell," said Mr. Eaton, who will relinquish his post to Mr. Kaiser and take early retirement when the deal is completed. "The bank is improving. In a normal world, one would have expected that, down the road, they might have been able to get a better price. But they got a very good price, and given the uncertainties, I'm not entirely sure I wouldn't have made the same decision."

From London to Cairo: A March Toward War?
 
The week's events seemed as carefully orchestrated as a Sousa, or maybe a James A. Baker 3d, march: Tuesday, the British Foreign Minister warned that time was running out for President Saddam Hussein of Iraq. Wednesday, President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt said war was inevitable unless Iraq withdrew from Kuwait in two or three months. Thursday, President Bush ordered at least an additional 150,000 troops to the Persian Gulf. And, in Moscow, the Soviet Foreign Minister sounded a softer but still harmonious note by admitting the possible use of force. Traders, who sent the price of oil below $32 a barrel on Monday, raised it to $35.53 after President Bush spoke. On Friday, oil finished at $33.89, as market participants decided that armed conflict was unlikely for the rest of the year. William L. Randol, an analyst at First Boston, figures that oil supplies will be tight enough to keep prices at about $30 through the winter. He adds another $5 or so for rising fears of war. "It's workable if nothing goes wrong," he said. "But the history is that things do go wrong."

The Non-inflationary Recession
 
The brighter side of this economic slowdown is that it is keeping higher energy prices from raising the cost of much else. Producer prices rose 1.1 percent in October, after even higher increases the two previous months. Take out food and energy, and core producer prices in October were flat. Economists say that, with a recession more likely, only a few industries like airlines can raise their prices. Joseph Carson, senior economist at Chemical Bank, said higher energy costs will show up instead in reduced corporate profits, wages and employment. If the last two oil price shocks increased inflation, "this one may be more deflationary," he said. "The pressures to discount prices because of a weakening economy appear to be winning out."
 
'Big Green' Wilts
 
Messages from a restive electorate: Let environmental issues wither, but let the tax battles resume. California's "Big Green" ballot proposition, described as the nation's most comprehensive environmental program, united many industries to help bring about its defeat. New York State turned down a $2.1 billion environmental bond act, leaving communities to pay for mandatory recycling and search for new landfills. While Republicans limited their off-year losses on Capitol Hill, Democratic gains in state capitals give them an advantage in redistricting come 1991. Voters handed over governorships to different parties, or independents, in 14 states, causing some governors to reconsider increased taxes. President Bush tried on Thursday to retread his no-tax pledge for the future -- "It ain't going to happen, I'll guarantee you," he said. Democrats, sensing the President's weakness, talked of reviving their proposal for a surtax on the wealthy.
 
An Early Christmas
 
No wonder their wreaths and tinsel and tree ornaments are already up. The department stores desperately want Christmas shopping to begin. The nation's major retailers reported an awful October, with sales down 1.2 percent from last October at Sears, Roebuck, and down 4.9 percent at J.C. Penney. But at Wal-Mart, sales were up 25 percent.
 
A Legal Cartel for Airlines
 
To some travelers, it seems that the airlines are behaving like the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries. The International Air Transport Association agreed last week to raise fares 4 to 8 percent, after authorizing raises in the same range about three months ago. Washington has given United States airlines antitrust immunity for taking part in the group. Consumer advocates growled, but analysts said the airlines are sharing the pain. "There is absolutely no gouging taking place," said Paul Karos, an analyst at First Boston. "The industry isn't coming close to recovering its fuel cost increases." The nation's airlines have also raised domestic fares about 9 percent since the gulf crisis began. With the economy weakening, Mr. Karos said, the airlines are unlikely to push prices higher unless there is war.

 
 
COMPANIES

 
Volvo's Car-Crushing Ads Backfire
 
The roof has caved in on Volvo's advertisements. The Swedish company tried to dramatize the safety of its cars with commercials showing a monster pickup truck, emblazoned "Bear Foot," crunching a row of cars and leaving only the Volvo intact. A dramatization it was: the Volvo roof was reinforced; the roof on another car weakened. When charged with false advertising by the Texas Attorney General, Volvo promised not to make unverified safety claims but said its advertising agency, Scali McCabe Sloves, had acted without its knowledge. Volvo ran disclaimers in several newspapers, while one executive bemoaned the public's failure to get a joke.
 
Twisted Market
 
The bond market's byzantine mechanics: A ratings downgrade for Citicorp debt on Monday raised prices for other issues, without hurting Citicorp itself. Citicorp's firmness was simple: traders had anticipated the downgrade, by Standard & Poor's. But investors did not let the misfortunes of the nation's largest bank holding company scare them into dumping other bonds. Instead, they bid up other issues, saying they expected a recession, with interest rates bound to fall. Then, on Wednesday, Citicorp tried to raise investor confidence in its own securities by deciding to redeem $275 million in preferred stock.
 
 Darryl Defects
 
It's bad enough that several investment banks are talking about leaving New York City. But last week, Darryl Strawberry decided to move his business from New York to Los Angeles. The Mets offered their leading home-run producer $15 million for four years. Like some Wall Street managing directors who earn almost as much, he felt abused, maligned and cheated. "I don't think the front office of the New York Mets appreciated Darryl Strawberry," he said. And so to the Los Angeles Dodgers for the chance to play in his hometown at $23.5 million for five years. "I couldn't sleep," said Tommy Lasorda, the Dodgers manager. "I was so excited." Lasorda might not sleep much come this spring, either, because now he has to manage a guy whose temperament makes a Salomon bond trader seem blissful and serene.
 
In Brief
 
The Nieman-Marcus Group will not carry the General Cinema label. The General Cinema Corporation withdrew its $240 million, $14.40-a-share offer for the 40 percent of the retailer it doesn't own after several shareholders filed suits saying the price was too low.
 
The Burger King Corporation helped end a boycott by a religious group with newspaper advertisements last week boasting of the company's support for "traditional American values on television." The group accused Burger King of sponsoring shows having "gratuitous sex, violence and anti-Christian stereotyping.
 
Prudential-Bache is laying off as many as two-thirds of its investment bankers as Wall Street firms continued to retrench.
 
 
INTERNATIONAL


Seoul Races to the Soviet Union
 
The first brand name that passengers arriving at Moscow's international airport see is not Marlboro, Pepsi, or Sony, but Samsung, emblazoned on every luggage cart. South Korea is rushing to secure a place in the Soviet market before the Japanese arrive. While the Japanese try to settle a territorial dispute with the Soviets, South Korea has re-established diplomatic relations, arranging to buy Soviet raw materials and offer steel and electronics in return. On Monday, Ju Young-Chung, the chairman of the huge Hyundai industrial and construction group, met with President Mikhail S. Gorbachev at the Kremlin. The South Korean press reported that Mr. Gorbachev asked for Hyundai's help in developing the Soviet Far East and easing shortages of consumer goods. Mr. Chung asked Mr. Gorbachev to help improve relations between the two Koreas. Progress on both fronts is likely. South Koreans hope to give their products the same cachet in the Soviet Union that Sony has in the West. One immediate problem with selling consumer goods to the Soviet Union, says Robert K. Kim, vice president of the Korea Fund, which invests in Korean securities: "The Russians can't pay for them."
 
Bringing Phones to Poland
 
Poland wants the fruits of its newly free markets to include a $15 billion telephone system by the turn of the century. The Government intends to abandon the state monopoly on domestic phone service, opening the field to Polish and foreign competitors. Communications Minister Jerzy Slezak said on Friday that the new communications system would increase the telephone count from 3.8 per 100 people to 30 in 10 years. Some 7,000 Polish villages are now without service. The Soviet Union has 15 phones per 100 people; the United States has about 50. Two American companies, which the Polish Government refuses to name, are among the five vying to set up a cellular network to serve 200,000 users.

HEADLINE: Selling a Free-Trade Pact With Mexico

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON

 BODY:
ALTHOUGH the Bush Administration will only begin negotiating a proposed free-trade agreement with Mexico this spring, Safi Qureshey, the chief executive of AST Research Inc. in Irvine, Calif., is already anticipating the wider opening of a major market for his computers. "We see a tremendous potential there," Mr. Qureshey said.
That is the kind of enthusiasm that Commerce Secretary Robert A. Mosbacher wanted to hear as he traveled the country recently, seeking support for the free-trade proposal. But if the Administration is to successfully negotiate a pact with Mexico that can win ratification by Congress, Mr. Bush and Mr. Mosbacher will also have to address the concerns of business owners like Rito Gutierrez, the president of Cal-Art Sportswear in downtown Los Angeles. 
 Mr. Gutierrez believes that an agreement would mean a "slow death" for his business by increasing competition from garment factories in Mexico, where wages are a fraction of those in the United States. "The apparel industry here, and particularly the sewing contractors, are virtually going to be put out of business," he said.
The proposed agreement with Mexico, which would eliminate almost all tariffs and other trade barriers, would aid the United States as a whole, and particularly border states like California and Texas. American companies seeking higher sales in Mexico or easier access to its cheap labor, as well as firms that facilitate or finance trade, would be clear winners.
But there would also be losers in the United States. Companies in many industries would face new competition from Mexican and American firms making their goods in Mexico. Some workers would see their jobs go south. And the losers could do more than gripe. Some, like organized labor and the textile and steel industries, could exert enough political clout to impede or derail an agreement.
MOREOVER, a free-trade accord with Mexico, formally proposed by President Carlos Salinas de Gortari to President Bush this summer, would be far more complex than a similar arrangement that took effect with Canada last year. Talks are likely to take years. Mexico's wages, education levels, regulatory climate and political system are far different from those in Canada and the United States. The Mexican plan could have a far-reaching impact on other issues like the environment and immigration.
PRESIDENT BUSH strongly favors a trade accord with Mexico, the nation's third-largest trading partner, after Canada and Japan. It would go a long way toward the Administration's goal of creating a hemispheric free-trade zone. Agreements with Canada and Mexico would establish a North American free-trade zone 25 percent larger than the European Community.
American critics of such a deal say they fear the flight of manufacturing and agriculture to Mexico, where low-wage workers are plentiful and environmental controls and labor regulations are looser. The dangers to the United States economy would increase, these critics say, ifPresident Bush followed through with his proposal to extend free-trade agreements throughout Latin America.
"The primary benefit which U.S. firms can gain from freer trade with Mexico, the Caribbean and Latin America is the opportunity to move production to locations where wage, benefit and regulatory costs are a fraction of those at home," said Richard Rothstein, an economist with the Economic Policy Institute, a Los Angeles research group. "Seduced by our own propaganda about the superiority of a free market, we are in danger of negotiating Mexican and other Latin American free-trade agreements which destroy American jobs and undermine environmental and labor standards for those who remain," he told a California state legislative committee recently.
Bush Administration officials, including Mr. Mosbacher, disagree. They say the benefits to the overall economy in the United States would outweigh the risks of lost jobs and evasion of environmental rules. An accord would improve the Mexican economy, they say -- and aid the United States by providing a vibrant market for its products and services.
These officials say Mexico is committed to bringing its environmental and other regulatory standards into line with those in the United States. And as new jobs are created in Mexico, they say, wages there would rise, reducing the differential with the United States. "An agreement would help Mexico, and that's great," Mr. Mosbacher said during a recent interview in Los Angeles. "But it will also create jobs and opportunities here in the U.S."
Both the opportunities and the risks of a free-trade pact are clearly visible in California, with its diverse economy and its close ties to Mexico.
To exporters, Mexico is an increasingly promising market. As part of his plan to open the Mexican economy, President Salinas has over recent years considerably reduced tariffs and attempted to lower daunting bureaucratic barriers to the sale of foreign goods.
As a result, companies like AST are starting to push into the market. AST recently opened a Mexico City office, with sales of $1 million worth of computers in the last six months -- a relatively modest amount, but 10 times as much as the company had ever sold in Mexico before.
FETZER VINEYARDS of Redwood Valley, Calif., is also watching Mexico closely. Foreign wine sales in Mexico have long been dominated by European vintners. But Gus Furtado, Fetzer's export manager, said that as tariffs on American wines have fallen, California vineyards have become increasingly interested. A free-trade agreement would permit California wines to become more competitive, he said. The company expects to sell 2,000 cases of wine in Mexico this year, up from 200 last year. "We see a great opportunity down the road for that market," Mr. Furtado said.
There could also be benefits to companies that want to assemble more of their products in Mexico. Under existing agreements with Mexico, American companies can ship components, free of the usual tariffs and duties, to plants for assembly by low-paid Mexican workers. With a free-trade agreement, more American companies, squeezed by competition to keep costs low, would likely do assembly work in Mexico. Some would also move entire manufacturing operations to Mexico, instead of simply sending components over the border. In some cases, American jobs would be lost. But without greater access to Mexican workers, companies would just shift production to other sources of cheap labor, especially in Asia.
Mattel Inc., based in Hawthorne, Calif., said that under a free-trade agreement, it would substantially increase its Mexican operations. Mattel already has two plants, in Tijuana and Monterrey, which produce 35 percent of the toys it sells in the United States. Mattel produces no toys in the United States -- the rest of its work is done mostly in Asia -- so the agreement would not result in the loss of manufacturing jobs in this country.
IN fact, Mattel said, increased operations in Mexico would benefit the American companies that supply virtually all the parts and equipment -- including plastics, dyes, machinery and packaging. -- used in the Mexican factories.
By eliminating tariffs, an agreement could also help some major California agricultural and food companies that have begun growing crops and processing food in Mexico and shipping them to the United States. But smaller farmers and produce growers in California fear that they would be at a severe disadvantage if imports increased because of Mexico's lower labor costs and looser rules on pesticides. Mexico is making the greatest gains in exporting fruits and vegetables that are labor-intensive, like vine-ripened tomatoes, which must be harvested by hand.
Mexican officials say they are tightening environmental restrictions, but many experts in the United States doubt that Mexican standards will become as strict as those in California any time soon. "Every year Mexico is competing with us more and more in fresh produce," said Roy Motter, one of the owners of Brawley Farms in the Imperial Valley east of San Diego. "We're concerned about the playing field being level."
The primary concern for small manufacturers is the dramatic wage differential. Ho Fat Seto, who owns the Ho Fat jeans-making factory in Los Angeles, said he must pay his 68 employees a minimum of $34 for an 8-hour day. His competitors in Mexico, he said, pay their workers roughly $3 for a day that may run much longer.
So far, he said, Mexican companies have not been able to take full advantage of lower wages because their garment factories have a reputation for producing shoddy goods and failing to meet schedules. American manufacturers don't count on these handicaps persisting. "Sooner or later the Mexicans will be successful," Mr. Seto said. "The labor situation in Mexico is already killing our business, and free trade will affect it even more, that's for sure."
 
 
CONTROLLING IMMIGRATION
 A FREE-TRADE agreement with Mexico, some experts say, could accomplish what the 1986 overhaul of the immigration law did not: slow the flow of illegal aliens into the United States.
Economists say the agreement would create many new jobs in Mexico and push up wages. With better jobs at home, fewer Mexicans would risk crossing the border. "To the extent that a free-trade agreement reduces the real wage differential between Mexico and the U.S. over a long period of time, it could have a very significant deterrent effect on future immigration," said Wayne Cornelius, the director of the Center for U.S.-Mexico Studies at the University of California at San Diego.
But the deterrent might not take effect for years, perhaps a decade, because it would take that long for new jobs to be created. The agreement could actually increase the flow of illegal immigrants, at least temporarily.
"If an agreement produces a general stimulus to the Mexican economy, it may give some Mexicans who had been planning to emigrate the financial means to do so," Mr. Cornelius said, "and to the extent that it stimulates the U.S. economy, it may encourage Mexicans who legalized under the 1986 immigration law to bring their dependents in."
It also remains unclear whether diminished immigration from Mexico would be an advantage for the United States. Reduced migration might ease the strain on social services, but it would also shrink the pool of low-wage workers that many manufacturers and farmers in the United States rely on to remain competitive.

HEADLINE: All About/Cruise Lines;
A Deluge of Growth in the Floating Vacation Market

BYLINE: By AGIS SALPUKAS

 BODY:
EVERY Sunday, newspaper travel advertisements bring a reminder that cruise ships have armed themselves for competitive battle. For example, seven-day cruises to the Caribbean that normally cost $1,800 are discounted to $1,000, airfare included. Those who shop around can pay as little as $700.
And more is on order. This year, 13 ships with 11,000 berths are being added to the cruise line fleet operating primarily out of North America, expanding capacity by 15 percent. The largest, Carnival Cruise Lines's Fantasy, has 2,025 berths -- more than many of the old ocean liners and all but the largest hotels. 
 Common sense would indicate that rapid expansion and the onset of a recession guarantee that the industry will sink. But cruise line executives have not built their fortunes on pessimism and doubt. Indeed, some say a recession will only add to the business coming their way. Bob Dickinson, a senior vice president for sales and marketing at Carnival, said that travelers will be attracted to cruise packages because they usually are all-inclusive -- air fare, lodging and food. "In tough economic times," he explained, "people want to know what they are getting into and how much they have to lay out."
 
PLAYING THE RECESSION
More Berths, but Higher Air Fares
 Through the last decade, the outlook for the cruise business has been as sunny as the Caribbean skies. Although most companies are private and need not release figures, analysts say industry revenues and profits have been growhing consistently.
Industry executives say they have just begun tapping the market. Mr. Dickinson estimates that only about 6 percent of all American vacation travelers have tried a cruise. The Cruise Lines International Association, a trade group, says the market for cruises in North America could reach $55 billion to $60 billion a year -- 10 times the level of sales today.
Growth is limited only by space on board, said Michael G. Mueller, an analyst for Montgomery Securities. Cruise lines "have always been able to fill up the new capacity," he said. Demographic trends are also on the industry's side, he added. "As more people get older," he explained, "they have more disposable income."
One other favorable current is the weak dollar. Some travelers, discouraged by the cost of visiting Europe, might settle for a Caribbean cruise instead.
Of course, not everyone believes the industry can sail through a recession, especially not smaller operators with aging ships.
Larry Fishkin, president of Cruise Line Inc., in Miami, which buys wholesale blocks of space then retails the berths to passengers, said that several small operators had called him in alarm over low bookings. Mr. Fishkin can offer little comfort. Autumn is always a slow season, with price breaks the norm, but he has found that discounts are especially deep this year. "I've seen prices for this period as low as I've seen them in seven or eight years," he said. Carnival was offering a rate of $695 for a seven-day cruise to repeat customers, he said.
Sally Smith, an analyst with Alex. Brown & Sons, said that the industry is being squeezed from two sides. Cruise operators, who usually buy plane tickets in bulk, are unable to pass along the entire 15 percent fare increases levied by airlines since August, when the Middle East crisis sent fuel prices soaring. The ships' own fuel costs have risen, too, but these usually account for less than 5 percent of their expenses.
Ms. Smith said that the demand for cruises grew straight through the last recession, in 1982. But she added that the industry then had far fewer berths to fill, and that few new ships were built during the recession.
To carry the expected traffic this time around, and provide more diversions, the latest ships are also some of the largest. The industry has been spending lavishly, on ships that can cost more than $200 million each. Industry analysts say the berth count will keep growing, by about 13 percent in 1991 and 9 percent in 1992 before retreating to a 4 percent gain in 1993. Possible overcapacity is unlikely to affect anyone's plans in the near term. It takes three or four years to build a ship, and halting construction is difficult and expensive.
 
WHAT'S IN A CRUISE?
Everything for The Middle Class
The cruise industry has changed immeasurably since the era of the really grand ocean liners. Back then, a cruise was the first-class way to reach a holiday destination. As recently as 20 years ago, about 500,000 people annually, most of them rich, took cruises of three days or more .
Now, the ships are destinations in themselves. Several lines run cruises to nowhere, with passengers staying on board. About 3.5 million people are expected to sail from North American ports this year. .
The man largely responsible for lowering the gangplank to the vacationing masses is Ted Arison, who founded Carnival Cruise Lines in 1972, beginning with one old ship, the Mardi Gras, during an energy crisis. To save on fuel, the ship traveled slowly, stopping at few ports.
To keep his customers happy about spending so much time on board, he installed a casino, a disco, a movie theater and two nightclubs. Who had time to long for Caribbean ports? Low prices and aggressive marketing helped persuade the middle class to clamber aboard.
Carnival's acquisition of the Holland America Line last year raised its revenues to $1.15 billion. The four other companies that, with Carnival, dominate the North American industry are Kloster Cruise Ltd., which owns Norwegian Cruise Lines, Royal Cruise and Royal Viking; Princess Cruises; the Royal Caribbean Cruise Line, and Chandris Fantasy Cruises.
Next for the industry? Estelle Lessack, for one, whose Travel Trends agency in Fort Lee, N.J., handles cruises on most lines, said the idea for most is to have a cruise for every taste. "So much is being offered on the cruise ships that it just about takes in everybody," she said.
 
TO MAXIMIZE RETURNS
Keep Them Aboard, Spending $50 a Day
With extra capacity visible on the horizon, the cruise ships are piling on the attractions, adding more sports, health and social programs than ever. Norwegian Cruise Lines boasts that golf and tennis pros will help passengers with their games. Net-draped driving ranges are available on board and golf courses and tennis courts, on shore. Others offer "spa cruises," with special wieght-loss, cholesterol-lowering diets and fitness programs in elaborate gyms.
For sports fans who want to see the stars in the off-season, Norwegian also plans to bring football and baseball players on board special cruises next year. Some lines have specialized in attracting older women, often widowed. Its ships are well stocked with hired men, most of them excellent dancers.
Cruise lines are also trying to earn more from passengers once they board by multiplying the opportunities for them to drink, shop and gamble. Many spend about $50 a day, which helps compensate for cruise discounts.
To spread the news, advertising budgets are substantially higher. And then there is one more audience the lines try hard to satisfy. They make sure that travel agents have special incentives to recommend a cruise. Besides requiring minimal effort to book, the commissions, at the larger agencies, tend to be 13 to 15 percent, 3 to 5 percentage points higher than for airlines and land-bound hotels.
 
 
>ON THE PRINCESS, WHO NEEDS A PORT?
 PETER and Ivonne West of Chicago hardly cared when, on its inaugural cruise, the Crown Princess had to steer clear of a hurricane and through some Caribbean storms. They gambled in the casino, danced in the discos, window shopped the boutiques around the three-story atrium and sampled six kinds of caviar at the ship's wine and champagne bar.
The Crown Princess, placed in service in September by Princess Cruises, belongs to a new generation of huge ships that aims to keep passengers so well entertained they have no time to yearn for the next port.
Longer than three Manhattan blocks and taller than a 13-story hotel, the ship cost more than $200 million. It has room for 1,590 passengers in cabins that are spacious by the industry's cramped standards.
The Crown Princess looks as though it was sculpted, not built, to resemble a dolphin gliding through the waves. The architect, Renzo Piano, also designed the arresting Pompidou Center in Paris.
Mr. Piano topped the ship with a glass dome 19 feet high, enclosing a palace of drinking, dancing and gambling. Not that passengers lack alternatives; among the 7 other cafes and bars, one called Kipling's is a cross between disco and tropical inn, with floor-to-ceiling mirrors, a raised stage for dancing, leather and rattan furniture, ceiling fans and potted plants.
Mrs. West, 33, sells insurance, and her husband, 41, drives a truck -- occupations that place them in the moderate-income group the cruise lines want to attract. They are veterans of many cruises, but the Crown Princess left them impressed. "It's a beautiful ship," Mrs. West said. "It's certainly big." But not even the biggest.
On the days they ventured outdoors, Mr. West shot skeet while his wife lounged on the deck, taking occasional dips in both pools.
They did have a few disappointments -- an indifferent waiter, a disc jockey who played the wrong music. No matter; they agree that they would eagerly go back.

America Is Still a Land of Opportunity

BYLINE: By HENRY TASHIMA; Henry Tashima is president of the Minolta Camera Company, Osaka, Japan.

 BODY:
I OFTEN get the feeling that the United States has lost some of the confidence it once had. America's perception of its economic vulnerability is reflected in the success of such books as "The Rise and Fall of the Great Powers" by Paul Kennedy, "The Reckoning" by David Halberstam, "Buying Into America" by Martin and Susan Tolchin, and numerous public opinion polls. But the United States is still the richest country in the world. The American people still enjoy the highest living standard of any people and the United States still plays a dominant role in the world economy.
America's gross national product far exceeds that of any other nation. Last year, it was $5.17 trillion. Its nearest rivals were Japan, at $2.82 trillion, and West Germany, at $1.5 trillion. Manufacturing continues to account for about 24 percent of the United States G.N.P., as it has since the 1960's. And the United States controls more than 60 percent of the world's computer industry and is the leader in supercomputers, computer software and microprocessors. Over the past two decades, the American share of total world exports has been fairly consistent at 17 percent. 
 Importation of foreign cars to the United States continues to increase, particularly from Japan. But the General Motors Corporation is No. 1 and Ford Motor Company is No. 2 in world auto sales, assets and profits. Both companies earn more than half their profits overseas.
Nor are America's big auto makers alone. The foreign operations of American companies account for more than $1 trillion in annual sales, roughly four times the total export of goods made in the United States and about seven to eight times recent American annual trade deficits.
Just about everyone in the world seems to recognize the fact that the United States is by far the world's most appealing land of opportunity -- everyone, that is, except Americans. Tourism and immigration are up, reflecting the high level of esteem in which the rest of the world holds the United States.
There are many reasons for this. The United States has the natural resources, the technological capabilities and the dedicated work force to cope with changing economic conditions. The country is unique in its ability to recognize, acknowledge and solve its problems.
The political and economic ideals that the United States has upheld are taking hold elsewhere, even in countries that once attacked the American way of life. Without American help, Japan could never have made the recovery it did after the war.
As Europe, Asia, and the rest of the world all move toward greater economic freedom and political unity, we must not lose sight of the role played by the United States. The whole world is in its debt. It is time for America to recognize the economic role it plays in the world.

HEADLINE: About Cars;
Acura's NSX: All-Aluminum Exotica

BYLINE: By Marshall Schuon

 BODY:
WHAT is so amazing about Acura's new NSX is not its blinding speed or the ripping mountain-lion snarl of the engine when you put your foot into it. What is so amazing is not the complex suspension that makes the NSX handle as well as anything yet put on the road. Nor is it the fact that hungry customers are pushing and shoving to pay double the car's sticker price.
No, what is so surprising about this tiger, this first true exoticar from Japan, is that it is such a pussycat to drive. The NSX is maybe the best sports car that ever was, but it behaves with all the civility of a Honda Accord -- which with good reason has become America's top-selling automobile. 
 Acura is Honda's luxury division, and the NSX is the world's first all-aluminum production car. It is also Honda's laboratory for technology, and it demonstrates what can be done when a major manufacturer puts its effort into making a super-car that refuses even a nod at the usual eccentricities.
 The NSX is many things, the first of which is gorgeous. When you cast eyes on it, it occurs to you that this is too much of a museum piece to put out there in the cut and thrust of traffic. What a shame to treat it like an automobile. It is a Ferrari, but better.
Then you get into it, and you know how much better. There is cream-colored leather, accented by hides that are dyed black. There is stitching, but without the quaint handmade look of a Maserati. The gauges are round and readable and everything is the way you think a car should be. It is the car that some of us drew in junior high school, the one that nobody ever built.
But you'd better be feeling sociable when you get behind the wheel, because everybody from dowagers in Lincolns to punks in primered Novas will engage you in conversation. I was not 10 minutes into the car, sitting at a traffic light, when the police went by, stopped, backed up. Normally, a serious uh-oh.
But all the Sir wanted to know was how I liked it, how long I'd had it, how fast was it. Good luck, he said.
The car was red, very. With a black roof. And I quickly realized that a trip in the NSX, despite its hot-rod capabilities, is often slower than that same trip in more boring machinery. The troopers give chase just to lay hands on the pretty flanks, just to look at the car up close.
But close or far, that body is sculpture. It is formed entirely of aluminum, as is every major component, and the elimination of iron and steel has cut the weight by 40 percent. The NSX weighs only 3,010 pounds, and that minimal avoirdupois has been wind-funneled and otherwise honed for quickness and fuel efficiency.
The aerodynamics are particularly noticeable in the passenger compartment, and airflow has been managed so well that driving with an open window is not much different than driving with the window closed, yielding only a quiet breeze.
Everything is of a piece, one part sweeping into the next. The large rear window curves into hind quarters that make one think of nothing so much as a quarter horse (or a Ferrari.) And the back window pops open so you can lift the huge rear package shelf for access to the engine.
The 3-liter V6 is mounted transversely and drives the rear wheels. It is compact, with aluminum block and heads, and its double overhead cams operate four valves per cylinder, generating an incredible 270 horsepower.
Honda has been successful in Formula One racing, and its experience -- and some racing parts -- have gone into the Acura's engine. Acceleration from zero to 60 is on the order of 5.6 seconds, and the NSX has a top speed of 168 miles an hour.
All the same, the car's light weight and technology conspire to provide an economy rating of 19 m.p.g., city, and 24, highway, good enough to avoid America's gas-guzzler tax, which will be doubled under the new Federal budget plan, rising to $1,000 from $500.
For all its deftness, the car feels surprisingly heavy, and part of that is a lack of power steering. That frivolity is available, however, if a buyer shuns the five-speed stick and opts for the four-speed automatic, although it is hard to see why anyone would.
The stick is stubby and leather-covered (what else?) and the shifter's throws are short and tight. The three-spoke wheel also lends a no-nonsense air to driving. It is leather-wrapped but hard and unpadded, and it feels much like the wheel in a Formula Ford. There is, of course, an air bag in the hub, and Honda has announced that all its products will have bags for both driver and passenger by the fall of 1993.
 Safety has also dictated massive disk brakes that are hooked to a four-channel antilock system, and the same computer that controls braking is in charge of traction control, automatically reducing engine power whenever it senses imminent wheel spin. That means that you can't twitch the rear end out, even in hard driving.
However, if you feel a sincere craving to steer with the accelerator, you can turn the system off with the push of a sensibly hard-to-get-at button up by the 185-m.p.h. speedometer. The other gauges are a 9,000-r.p.m. tachometer with a 7,900 redline, and meters for oil pressure, temperature, volts and fuel. The controls, like the rest of this car, are pretty much perfect, and the NSX is the first car that I have seriously considered running away with.
Apparently, a lot of people feel that way, and would-be buyers are queuing up with obscene amounts of cash in hand. Honda last week raised the sticker for the second time this year, pushing it from the original $58,000 to $61,000, but that is laughable, given the going price.
Most American dealers have received only one or two of the cars thus far, and a lot are keeping them for themselves. Those who aren't are selling them for $75,000 to $80,000, and private speculators are offering them at well over $100,000.
In Japan, the NSX costs even more, and there is a waiting list in the homeland of almost three years. But 17 lucky residents of Hiroshima won't have to wait that long. They won a recent lottery, and the prize was permission to buy the cars for a paltry $65,000.

HEADLINE: Voters in Westchester Approve Air Terminal

BYLINE: By JAMES FERON

 BODY:
ERIC LANGELOH, Westchester County's Commissioner of Transportation, has about two dozen architects' renderings in his office of proposed new terminals for the county's airport, right across the state line from Greenwich. The earliest drawing is "dated 1946, the year I was born," he said.
It may seem to Mr. Langeloh and other county officials that they have been dealing with the issue of a new airport terminal for most of their lives. 
 "You're looking at 45-odd years worth of people planning and arguing and debating," Mr. Langeloh said. "For it finally to get out to the public and for the public to say 'Yes, let's do it,' that's a major accomplishment."
Last week, in a $21 million bonding referendum, Westchester voters provided the go-ahead for a 41,000-square-foot replacement terminal. But just barely. The proposal was approved by a slender margin of 84,077 votes in favor and 79,587 against, or 51.37 percent to 48.63 percent.
 
What Happens Next
 The approval sets several events in motion, with the terminal's construction being the final, rather than the initial, accomplishment.
"Within 30 to 45 days," Mr. Langeloh said, "we'll be letting bids on the first phase, which is the access roadwork, an interior road system that will cost $5.7 million and represent a year's worth of work beginning next spring."
The road will be rebuilt from "where you currently pick up your parking ticket," he said. It will be redesigned, "so that you'll be able to go directly to the terminal for drop-offs or to a new parking structure," the second airport project.
The three-story, 1,200-space garage will be built for $17 million by a developer after public bids. That should be completed by the spring of 1992, when construction of the two-level terminal will begin. It should be in use by the spring of 1993.
 The struggle against the proposed terminal, fought by elected officials and homeowner groups in nearby communities in both Connecticut and New York, dominated the final weeks of the election campaign.
 <> <> <> <> Supervisor Donald B. Gioffre of Rye, N.Y., a leader in the effort to defeat the terminal plan, was diplomatic in defeat as he described the next stage of the struggle over what opponents still feel is an inevitable expansion of the airport. But he was still angry over the loss itself.
"Since the people have voted, it is only right to respect that vote," he said. "The county has offered to cooperate with us, so we will hold it accountable for its word that the terminal will cost only $21 million, that it will guarantee a continuation of the nighttime curfew, and that it will maintain a passenger cap of 234 passengers per half-hour."
 
A Reminder on a Pledge
 The county has also pledged to keep "larger and noisier planes away" from the airport, he said.
And finally, he said, "I hope we don't see the area around the new terminal magically transformed into additional apron space for aircraft."
 Mr. Gioffre expressed bitterness about what he felt was a massive, government-financed campaign to enlist support for the referendum.
Peter W. Delaney, Westchester's General Services administrator, headed the campaign in support of the proposal under County Executive Andrew P. O'Rourke. Mr. Delaney said that $50,000 was raised privately and that $100,000 was spent by the county in supporting the referendum.
 The $150,000 total was "absurdly low for at least four mailings, brochures and other material that appeared throughout the county," Mr. Gioffre said. "The Town of Rye spent $3,000 on one mailer, done by myself and others and mailed locally." Larger amounts were spent by others opposing the referendum.
Mr. Delaney conceded that unions, private businesses and others likely to benefit from a modernized airport were pressed into service to support the referendum.
 
'We Knew We'd Be Blitzed'
 "Those who opposed the referendum had an emotional issue on their side," Mr. Delaney said. "So we knew we had to win at least 65 percent of the vote outside the airport area, where we knew we'd be blitzed with 'no' votes. We barely made it."
Mr. Delaney said he and others in Westchester County government had "tried to talk the County Executive out of going to a referendum, but he felt he had no choice."
He recalled that Mr. O'Rourke said, "If we go to the people and do it right, we'll win and that will settle it."
 
Two Issues Faced Head-On
 Mr. Delaney said the narrow victory came about after "taking two issues head on: payment and expansion."
"We addressed the argument that it would cost more than the $21 million," he said, noting the county's position that increased revenues would more than cover the costs. The county campaign also disputed inferences that the terminal was a wedge to allow expanded operations at the airport.
Mr. Delaney said the county enlisted the help of pilots who use the airport, having them visit nursing homes and other places where the elderly congregate to persuade them of the referendum's benefits. "The elderly generally vote negatively on bond issues," he said.
 
Linking Airport to Jobs
 Corporate leaders were given placards and other visual material to display to their employees, "who were told that it was in their own best interests to support a more modern airport facility in Westchester," Mr. Delaney said. "We suggested that they link the economic vitality of their company with their employees' jobs."
Mr. Gioffre said he had no intention of initiating any legal process that would impede the airport project, but that he and others would carefully monitor the progress of the improvement plan.
Mr. Langeloh said the county, for its part, would work publicly on each stage of the program and would confer frequently with the county's Board of Legislators, which had requested an informal oversight role.

HEADLINE: A Better Way to Reward Quality

 BODY:
To the Editor:
There is a basic flaw in the administration of the Malcolm Baldrige National Quality Awards described in "The Baldrige Badge of Courage - an Quality" (Oct. 21). The article says awards are limited to two companies in each category. If the purpose of these awards is to upgrade product quality throughout American industry, this limitation defeats that end.
The British have done it much better with their BS 5750 Quality Award, chartered by the Government and administered by the British Standards Institute. Under the BSI program, a company fills out a relatively simple form which covers some two dozen criteria: not only activities directly related to quality assurance, but also other aspects of company operations like management philosophy and employee training.
Applicant companies are inspected onsite. If they pass, they receive the award and can use its symbol in promotional materials and advertising. Recipients must be reinspected periodically to maintain their qualification. A major incentive to qualify is that most companies and the Government now limit purchases to vendors who have proved, through receipt of the award, that their products meet high standards.
The BS 5750 award has now been accepted as the model within all European Community countries for a similar program, designated the ISO 9002 award. It is run by the International Standards Organization for all types of industries. The standards for both the BS 5750 and ISO 9002 awards are strictly enforced, impose no limit on how many companies may qualify. The Baldrige awards, on the other hand, give both a publicity and bottom-line coup to one or two well-heeled companies (its application takes hundreds of hours to complete and requires a hefty accompanying fee) rather than encouraging quality raising at all levels of industry.

HEADLINE: Food Airlifts Called Insufficient in Ethiopia Region

BYLINE: By JANE PERLEZ

DATELINE: NAIROBI, Kenya, Nov. 10

 BODY:
Daily airlifts of food for the besieged town of Asmara, the Eritrean capital, and the immediate countryside are proving insufficient to keep the million people in the province under Ethiopian Government control from starving, relief officials say.
Severe malnutrition among young children rose sharply last month, and their health was likely to deteriorate further because of crop failure in the area for the second year in a row. 
 "People are getting weaker, and there is zero harvest right now," saidWillard J. Pierson, the mission director of the United States Agency for International Development in Addis Ababa. The daily airlifts by C-130 aircraft from Addis Ababa to Asmara, financed by Western governments, were only able to carry enough food for quarter rations, he said.
The drought cycle in the Horn of Africa in recent decades has been about once every decade. But the cycle compressed in the 1980's to every several years, and this year the rains failed again, making it back-to-back years of drought in northern Ethiopia. The rains have also failed in the northern Sudan, where about one million tons of relieffood will be needed to avert large-scale starvation, United States and United Nations officials say.
A United Nations report said this week that at least three million people in Ethiopia would be at risk of hunger because of the meager harvest. About 600,000 tons of food would be needed in northern Ethiopia, much of which is under rebel control, the report said.
Asmara, a palm-tree lined, Italianate city from the colonial days of Eritrea, has been under siege since the rebel Eritrean People's Liberation Front took the seaport of Massawa on the Red Sea in February. The only way to reach the million people in the remaining triangle of land in Eritrea that is still controlled by the Government of President Mengistu Haile Mariam is by air, Mr. Pierson said.
For months now, two chartered C-130's from a company called Trans Afrique have been making four trips a day to Asmara from Addis Ababa carrying grain and cooking oil at a cost to the Western donors of $500 a ton, a sum that Mr. Pierson described as very high for relief food. The donors have spent $14 million for the food lifeline so far, he said.
Diplomatic efforts to persuade the rebel front to allow the port of Massawa to be opened for humanitarian food deliveries to Asmara and the vicinity have failed. Part of the strategy of the rebels appears to be either to starve out or to capture Asmara, which their leader, Isais Afewerk, has described as the ultimate prize of their three decade-long struggle to win the independence of Eritrea from Ethiopia.
The rebels have been shelling the airport at Asmara but concentrating on the military section of the tarmac, thus not interfering with the relief flights, Mr. Pierson said.
The director of Catholic Relief Services in Addis Ababa, John Wiater, said that during a visit to Asmara and outlying villages last month he saw significant increases in malnutrition, increased susceptibility to malaria because of poor health, and severe water shortages in Asmara.
A survey of 1,500 children in four Asmara feeding centers in October had found 19 percent in "grave" condition, compared with 3.5 percent in September, Mr. Pierson said.

HEADLINE: Rentals Flourish as Home Sales Slow

BYLINE: By SHAWN G. KENNEDY

 BODY:
IN the New York region's troubled home market, the rental alternative is becoming an increasingly attractive temporary haven for many would-be sellers and buyers. Among them are Samuel and Giedra Trocone, who see the should-we-sell-should-we-buy dilemma from both sides.
The Trocones went house-hunting in New Jersey's Morris County in preparation for a move from Connecticut this year and found a real estate market as unsettled as the one they were leaving behind in Stamford. 
 Owners in New Jersey, the Troncones found, were lowering their prices every few weeks. But rather than viewing these reductions as a golden opportunity, the Troncones took them as a warning sign.
"We had sold our house in Stamford," said Mr. Troncone, an executive with a telecommunications company, "so we were very open to the idea of buying. But I was not comfortable with the drop in property values. With the region's economy in the shape it's in, I didn't see a reason to join in the fall."
The Troncones parked the equity they got out of their Stamford house in a bank account and decided to rent rather than buy. They are paying $1,900 a month for a two-bedroom colonial they found in Mendham, N.J. The owner, who is on assignment overseas, has given them a one-year lease with a one-year renewal option.
The Troncones are not alone. Throughout the New York region, many families who had been looking for a house or apartment to buy, and many who will not sell at the lower prices they can get, are stepping out of the market temporarily and retreating into the relative safety of rental arrangements. Most see renting only as a safe port in a storm; they fully intend to return to owner-occupancy when the market settles.
But while renting can bring temporary protection against the uncertainties of the market, real estate professionals warn that there can be powerful disincentives in such a move. Some owners find that the rent they can get may not fully cover mortgage payments, property taxes and the costs of maintenance. They also face the problem of finding reliable tenants who will pay the rent on time and take good care of their property.
Those who rent after selling must be careful not to lose the capital gains rollovers and profit exclusions the Federal Government allows only to homeowners. They must bear the costs of moving and setting up a home in accommodations they will not be in very long. And for some, the personal anxiety of living half-settled in temporary quarters may weigh as heavily as the financial considerations.
Jean and Hank Barletta took a month-to-month lease in a condominium development in Summit, N.J., after selling their house in Madison. They want to buy another home in Madison and are renting until they find what they feel is the best house for the $250,000 they have to spend.
Mrs. Barletta said that after having a house, living in a two-bedroom apartment with their two young boys, Robbie, 6 years old, and Ryan, 3, has not been easy.
"Our children are very active," she said. "We don't have the space we need. The walls are thin. Our neighbors know we are here."
Another drawback of their current living arrangement is that the apartment they rent is being offered for sale.
"Not only do we have people coming through to see the apartment," she said, "but we will have only two months to move out if it is sold. If we have not bought a house by then we will have to rent again."
One sign of the shift in the rental market, realtors say, is that many of those who have put homes up for rent are owner-occupants rather than investors. "In the past,"said Robert Abbott, a broker with the Wyckoff, N.J., office of Coldwell Banker, "the majority of the rentals were from investors or developers who could not sell new condominiums. But there are many more homeowners listed with us now."
The statistics of one Multiple Listing Service in Westchester County clearly reflect the trend.
In October 1989, the listing service that covers mid-Westchester County in the vicinity of White Plains showed 377 one-family houses for rent. Last month, the same board had 547 one-family homes for rent. In that same period, the number of apartments for rent -- many of them individually owned condominiums -- went from 150 to 240.
The service's statistics for its member brokerage offices for the six months preceding each Oct. 20 show an increase in rental transactions from 165 in the earlier period to 281 this year.
"I don't believe that our listings represent any more than 20 percent of what is available for rent in Westchester County," said Gilbert Mercurio, executive vice president of the Westchester Board of Realtors, which operates the Multiple listing service. "For one thing, rentals represent a tiny portion of the transactions our office handles. We are still primarily a service for residential sales. But I do think our rental figures reflect the market trend. There has definitely been an increase in rental activity."
People in the market for houses, town houses and apartments have a wealth of options ranging from studios renting for $500 a month or less to large suburban homes or estates in exclusive communities where owners are asking $10,000 a month.
"Home rentals in the suburbs used to be few and far between," said Joyce Jones, a marketing consultant to Coldwell Banker in northern New Jersey and Westchester County. "And often they were not in the best condition. Sometimes they were problem properties or homes that were rented until their owners could complete divorces. Now the rentals come in all price ranges in all communities."
Many who have put their homes up for rent, like Edna and Douglas Robbins, have done so as a last resort. The Robbinses recently decided, after trying for two years to sell, to try renting their home in Florham Park, N.J.
"WE started asking $342,000," said Mrs. Robbins, "We've just come down to $269,000 and we don't want to go lower than that. So we will rent with the option to buy. But that will only be if a buyer does not come along first."
Mrs. Robbins said that now that their children are grown and on their own, she and her husband find their four-bedroom, two-and-a-half-bath house too large. They want to move to a small house on the Jersey Shore. If no buyer of their current house comes forward, they will seek to rent it for about $1,700 a month.
Over the last two years, the Robbinses -- like others trying to sell homes -- put time and money into repairs and refurbishing.
"We pulled up the blue-and-green carpeting because the color scheme was dated," Mrs. Robbins said. "We painted the walls white and moved out some of the furniture. I hope our latest concession makes a difference because I don't know what else we can do."
In New York City, too, many would-be sellers have been getting into the rental market, and some real estate brokerage companies whose businesses were strictly sales operations until a year or so ago are elbowing their way onto the rental scene.
In the last year, companies that deal with properties mainly at the upper end of the Manhattan market, among them William B. May and Halstead Properties, have started rental divisions. They have been motivated, their principals say, by the fast income from the fees collected when rental deals are completed as well as by a desire to maintain relationships with potential sellers and buyers.
"Every week," said Lisa Schlussel, who heads the new rental division of William B. May Company, "we are getting more calls from owners on Park, Madison and Fifth Avenues who say they are now open to the idea of renting."
Ms. Schlussel described her company's territory as the Upper East Side between 60th and 90th Streets, from Fifth to Lexington Avenues.
Halstead Properties has put two rental specialists in each of its three offices -- at 1065 Madison Avenue, between 80th and 81st Streets, Columbus Avenue between 79th and 80th Streets and 451 West Broadway near Prince Street in SoHo.
"We are putting money into canvassing, research and training," said Clark Halstead, the company's owner. "This is not a temporary move for us. I think the demand for rentals at the high end will survive even after the sales market comes back."
Mr. Halstead said that his company will bolster its new rental division with a rental management service that will cater to both owners-in-residence and investor owners.
In the luxury market, apartment owners who try to rent often find themselves in competition with developers of newly built condominium and cooperative units who cannot find buyers. As a result, rents have been falling. Nevertheless, brokerages in the city and suburbs report no lack of tenants willing to pay high rents for the flexiblity of living in homes they do not own.
Brokers and agents say well-priced rentals in good locations can snapped up in a matter of hours. Some agents say they have been surprised by the rents owners are getting.
"We recently rented a town house on 18th Street between Second and Third Avenues which I originally expected to go for between $6,000 and $7,000 a month," said Anthony Czebatul, a sales associate with Eychner Associates, a brokerage firm which handles sales and rentals in Chelsea, Greenwhich Village and SoHo. "But the family renting it now is paying $8,000 a month in rent."
IN another Greenwich Village rental that Mr. Czebatul handled, a two-bedroom apartment on West 12th Street between Greenwhich Avenue and West 4th Street went for $1,800 a month even though similar apartments in the same building went renting for $1,400 until this fall.
Ms. Schlussel, of William B. May, said that in setting a market rent homeowners can use the same strategy they would employ for pricing a home for sale.
"The same things that make an apartment a desirable purchase also apply to rentals," she said. "Owners need to find out what similar apartments or homes in their neighborhood have rented for and use that as their guide. As more homes and apartments are put on the market as rentals, this is easier to do."
Ms. Schlussel added that many co-op boards continue to resist sublets by their tenant-owners. This gives owners of condominiums and town houses an advantage.
"Town-house owners don't have to get board approval," she said, "so if they are in good condition and the rent is right, they can rent fairly quickly."
Many who have sought rentals in Manhattan are newcomers to the city, like Robert Neborak and Therese Esperdy, who see themselves as renters only for the short-term.
The couple, who rent a one-bedroom apartment in the East Village, moved from the Philadelphia area about 18 months ago, not long after they were married.
"We looked for something to buy," said Mr. Neborak, a landscape architect with his own business. "but nothing we saw really wowed us and prices were still pretty high. Sellers were not being realistic."
Another factor in their decision to rent rather than buy was that both Mr. Neborak and Ms. Esperdy own homes in Pennsylvania that they have not yet sold.
"Renting is new to us," he said. "It is not something we want to do. But for now it is the best way to deal with our situation. We didn't see the advantage of owning three homes in places where the markets are depressed." They can afford to wait for the market to rebound because they both have tenants in their homes in Pennsylvania.
"We pay $1,400 a month in rent," said Mr. Neborak. "The rents we are getting for our homes in Pennsylvania cover our expenses, but we don't see a profit at that end."
But for some renters, the strategy of renting rather than buying offers only short-term protection from the market's downward drift.
The Troncones, for example, may resume their house-hunting next winter. Without buying another primary home, they risk losing the capital gains rollever that lets them postpone paying tax on their profit by applying that gain to the purchase of another home. The Internal Revenue Service gives sellers 24 months to reinvest in another prime residence before the tax becomes payable.
"Right now," said Mr. Trancone, "we are reconsidering the economy of renting versus purchasing. We would like to divert the money we spend on renting to a purchase. The deciding factor will be the economy. If the market drops further because of fear of a recession, it would be better to wait and see. However, if the economy stabilizes, it may be more economical to purchase. We just have to keep our eyes on the market."
 
RENTAL IMPLICATIONS FOR PERSONAL INCOME TAX
 WHEN owners convert their primary residences into rental properties, the rental income they receive is taxable like all other forms of income. However, they may deduct mortgage interest, property taxes, agent's fees, repairs and other costs of operating the property. The policy applies to all kinds of homes, among them single- and two-family houses, condominiums and cooperatives.
In addition, owners who rent out their homes for more than a year may be able to claim a depreciation allowance on the property. In some circumstances, resident shareholders in co-op buildings who rent their apartments can claim for tax purposes their share of the co-op corporation's depreciation.
On a subsequent sale, however, any capital gain on the property will be fully taxable unless the residence again qualifies as the owner's primary residence. However, a home can qualify as the owner's prime residence even if he is renting it, as long as he is also making efforts to sell it. Once the sales effort is abandoned, however, a home being rented looses its status as a prime residence.
If a homeowner decides to move back into a home that has been a rental property, he can re-establish prime residency the day he moves back if the purpose is really to live in the home again and not to qualify for the postponement of tax in a sale. Owners who intend to take the one-time, $125,000 exclusion of gain allowed to homeowers, however, must be 55 years or older on the date of sale and must have lived in their homes for three out of the previous five years.
While most tax isssues affect owners, a tenant who had sold a home before becoming a renter may also be affected by the tax rules. For example, the tax code says those who profit from the sale of a prime residence must postpone paying the gains tax if the profit is reinvested in another prime residence within 24 months of the sale of the first residence. But if a new prime residence is not bought within two years, any capital gain on the sale of the former home will be fully taxable.
Because of the many complications of the tax rules, owners who want to rent and former owners who move into rentals should consult an accountant or a lawyer. Among useful bulletins available free from the Internal Revenue Service are "Residential Rental Property" (IRS publication #527) and "Tax Information for Homeowners and Owners of Condominiums and Cooperative Apartments," (IRS publication #530).
 
HOW THE RENTAL FEE WORKS
 WHEN a real estate company serves as matchmaker between a tenant and the owner of an apartment or house, it is entitled to a fee for the service. There are no city or state regulations that set these fees; they are entirely negotiable.
According to rental agents, the current range of what is considered a fair and competitive fee runs from one month's rent to 15 percent of the first year's rent. The fee for an apartment renting for $1,600 month would be $1,600 to $2,880.
For as long as anyone can remember, the rental market in New York City has been so tight that is has been understood by all parties that the fee would be paid by the tenant. But the current abundance of rental housing -- primarily at the luxury level in new buildings -- has turned the tables. Many agents now are suggesting that owners of studio or one- or two-bedroom apartments in high-rise buildings who want to rent quickly offer to pay all or part of the fee.
Most housing listed with real estate agencies is unregulated. But in New York City, some landlords of rent-stabilized housing list their units with agencies when they become available. The fee system is the same as for free-market housing, although the rent stabilization code prohibits a landlord or anyone connected with him, like a managing agent or superintendent, from collecting a fee in connection with the renting of a unit. In practice, however, high fees or key money payments, though illegal, often are demanded for attractive stabilized apartments with below-market rents.
Currently there is an abundance of residences listed for rent in newspaper classified ads that include the words "NO FEE." This means the owner is trying to rent without an agent or an agency is being used and the owner has agreed to pay the fee.
Owners seeking to rent have the option of using the open listing system or giving one agency an exclusive listing.
According to Kimberly Fitzgerald, who is in charge of the rental division in the Coldwell Banker office in White Plains, with an open listing a property becomes available through several agencies. When a residence is rented, the office that makes the deal collects the fee, which is ususally paid by the tenant.
When an owner gives a real estate office an exclusive, the contract specifies that any rental agreement be made through that office, with the owner paying the fee. Ms. Fitzgerald says that in many of these arrangements, the agency with the exclusive will share the listing with others, which increases the exposure for the residence.
One service of a real estate agency is helping the owner determine if a potential tenant will be responsible.
"It is the owner who determines what the requirements will be," said Ms. Fitzgerald. "They say what will be needed in terms of employment, credit checks and whether the tenant must have written references." -- SHAWN G. KENNEDY

HEADLINE: Perspectives: Low-Income Housing;
New York's Push Into Rental Production

BYLINE: By ALAN S. OSER

 BODY:
GIVE it a long and complicated title and slide it through the Legislature without much controversy and the general public may never know it's there.
But the $128 million Turnkey-Enhanced Housing Trust Fund Program is not only there, but even up and running in New York State. It got its push two years ago from Gov. Mario M. Cuomo and Alexander B. Grannis, a Manhattan Democrat who is the long-term chairman of the Assembly's Housing Committee and a booster of subsidies to produce low-income housing. 
 It is a statewide grant program that has begun to produce debt-free new or gut-rehabilitated rental units under nonprofit management for the homeless and low-income households. Since the grant pays the full cost and is not even partially repaid by mortgage debt, the subsidy per family is extraordinarily high -- perhaps $11,000 per family a year in New York City new construction. Beneficiaries' rent covers operating costs and property taxes, which are often abated.
Now, as Governor Cuomo prepares for his third term, he will have to decide how much new money to seek to keep the housing coming and the management machinery running. It was an achievement of Richard L. Higgins, who this month is leaving Cuomo administration for private life after two years as Commissioner of Housing and Community Renewal, that it became possible to translate legislative authority into a working program.
After three rounds of competitive bidding, $122 million has been committed to 35 developments statewide, with 1,360 apartments. Twelve of the projects are in New York City, of which seven will be new buildings, with a total cost of $68 million. Much of the construction has already begun. Some is complete.
Selected sponsors -- in New York City usually a private builder allied to a small nonprofit housing company -- get a state commitment for a permanent mortgage before construction starts and use it to find private construction financing. The builder and lender assume the risk of completing the building within budget. When they finish, they "turn over the key" for occupancy.
In New York City, the total development cost of each gut-rehabilitated unit is averaging about $93,000. The full cost of each new unit is about $115,000. The costs include an operating reserve fund of 5 percent.
From the standpoint of housing policy, there is an irony in this program. Government is advancing this most generous of all housing subsidy programs at the very time when far less costly means might be used to save existing, privately owned, low-income housing units. But that would mean a new rent increase to pass along the costs to tenants, or a new shallow-subsidy program -- perhaps in the form of expanded tax abatements for the elderly -- or both.
Lately the Community Preservation Corporation, the bank consortium that is a major lender to private multifamily rental housing in New York City, has been warning of the threat of a new wave of housing abandonments in the 90's. The key factors are an upsurge in water and sewer charges and in property taxes. If a there are additional fuel-oil costs this winter, mortgage delinquencies and abandonments could follow rapidly.
The water and sewer charges and the higher taxes are felt more keenly in poor than in middle-income neighborhoods, the report noted. Since the buildings will be charged for water on the basis of actual rather than estimated use, those occupied by large families will get the heaviest blow. Overoccupancy abounds in low-income buildings.
AS for property taxes, they are a result of rapidly rising assessments. The cumulative assessment increase in rent-stabilized buildings citywide over the last three years has been about 40 percent, the Community Preservation Corporation says. But in the southeast Bronx it was 90 percent; in the Highbridge and Morrisania sections of the Bronx it was 55 percent and in the Crown Heights section of Brooklyn, it was 50 percent.
One cause is that assessments in rentals have been affected by the prices paid by speculators planning co-op conversions. Most such conversions failed or never started, but the sales prices raise assessments anyway.
The corporation calls for unspecified measures to ease the impact of reassessment policies on the low-income rentals and "mitigate the regressive effect of water metering on poorer communities."
Fifteen years ago the failure to establish timely policies to assist privately owned rental housing led to the housing losses that the state's turnkey program is now helping to correct. The visual evidence is striking, for example, on East Second Street between Avenues A and B on the Lower East Side. Among the several city-financed rehabilitations completed or under way on the street there is a state turnkey-assisted project. It includes three 1898 tenements at 195-99 East Second Street and two adjoining buildings at 8-12 Avenue B.
The project has a history. Long-term tenants of the tenements struggled to get help for the building after the owner abandoned the buildings. They succeeded in getting a $1 million Congressional demonstration grant to assist rehabilitation. But what has finally put the nonprofit sponsor over the top financially has been a $3.2 million commitment under the turnkey program. It will create 34 apartments, 10 of them for families nominated by agencies assisting the homeless and the rest from a waiting list of people with incomes of about $20,000 a year.
The total project has 48 apartments. Unlike other turnkey projects, this development will have some private mortgage financing. The nonturnkey tenants may include some of the original tenants. Community organizers put together the Lower East Side Mutual Housing Association, which hired Eric Kolbe, a housing professional, as its executive director. It is the nonprofit sponsor of the project, and it hopes to do others.
In mutual housing, tenants pay a membership fee of $2,500 when they move in and participate in management decisions. "We will suspend the fee for people earning under 80 percent of median income," said Mr. Kolbe, "but when their wages reach that level we'll get the payment over time for their apartments." Mayco Construction Company, a small general contractor, has begun the $4.63 million rehabilitation.
A development cost of $96,400 a unit to revive severely deteriorated 92-year-old buildings would strike many construction people as obscene. It is done because of the strong community pressures for rehabilitation at any cost on the Lower East Side.
Other turnkey projects are totally financed by the state. Typically, 30 percent of the tenants are homeless families and 70 percent families with incomes up to 80 percent of the median, which usually means households of $20,000 to $25,000.
This month the state turnkey program took another forward step when work began on the first of the new, rather than rehabilitated, buildings planned under the program. This is a 76-unit, six-story rental at 939-53 East 174th Street in the Bronx, in a busy location near Southern Boulevard and Boston Road. The sponsor is the Mid Bronx Desperadoes Community Housing Corporation in partnership with Procida Construction Company.
Mr. Higgins, in an interview, said: "In New York City we can't buy land. Elsewhere we could pay up to 20 percent of the project cost for the land." That confined its use mainly to properties already owned by the city, usually in the poorest neighborhoods. Also, he said, the requirement that 30 percent of the tenants be at welfare-rent levels and the rest at no more than 80 percent of median income sharply restrains the locations of turnkey activity.
But the program has the advantage of getting public officals and their procedures out of the construction process itself. The state cares only that the building meets the plans and specifications. For a state agency that developed a reputation for being unable to spend the housing dollars appropriated to it, it is no small achievement to get project commitments for $128 million in low-income nonprofit-sponsored housing developments. But it has also been an extravagant use of subsidy money.
In new construction this will become even clearer than in rehabilitation, as property owners, including the city, try to realize the value of their property when they sell. Also, the city's own snail-like site-acquisition processes will impede any broad use of the system for new construction. In the end, turnkeys are likely to be occasional demonstration projects, doing little to meet the larger issue for lower-income housing, centering on preserving existing stock.

HEADLINE: Commercial Property: Banking Chambers;
Finding Tenants to Fill the Temple-of-Finance Voids

BYLINE: By DAVID W. DUNLAP

 BODY:
A TRIP to the bank once meant a journey into a Roman temple or a Florentine palazzo or -- at least -- a generously proportioned and luminous contemporary space with high ceilings and huge windows. Today, a trip to the bank usually means a moment or two at something not much larger than a telephone booth.
Technology, plus a change in the way banks present themselves, plus shrinking budgets for expensive real estate have left a number of big banking spaces vacant. 
 Because they were meant to be showcase tenants at high-profile locations, the banks' emptiness is that much more conspicuous.
Chase Manhattan has left a large space at the Avenue of the Americas and 47th Street. Irving Trust has left the blockfront space one block north. A former Manufacturers Hanover branch at Fifth Avenue and 57th Street has been vacant two years. And a Goldome branch in the Helmsley Building, Park Avenue and 46th Street, is momentarily empty.
Morgan Guaranty has moved its tellers downstairs from what was once a well appointed public banking room on the southwest corner of Fifth Avenue and 44th Street. Bankers Trust has vacated its space entirely on the other side of the intersection.
Meanwhile, the Landmarks Preservation Commission has proposed to designate several significant interiors: the former Greenwich Savings Bank (now Crossland Savings) at Broadway and 36th Street, the Manufacturers Hanover branch at Fifth Avenue and 43d Street and the former Central Savings Bank (now Apple Bank) at Broadway and 73d Street. Whatever else happens, it is clear that spaces like these will not be built again.
"The temple quality or the church-like quality of a bank's central office is a thing of the past," said Robert H. Dugger, chief economist for the American Bankers Association, based in Washington.
"Corporate presentation is still very important," he said, "but the old-style Temple of Finance aura is no longer appropriate in today's financial environment. It reflects a static, heavy corporate presence which is simply not consistent with the demands for flexibility, adaptiveness and speed in modern finance. These latter qualities are what banks want to convey in their corporate image. Now you have this cross-current of corporate image joined with the facts of financial technology and cost minimization concerns and they add up to significant reductions in space needs."
"It's a very difficult problem dealing with bank spaces," said Elizabeth Rodgers, of Rodgers & McCauley, a retail consultancy with offices in New York and Philadelphia. "They tend to have very large square footages. They have gigantic ceiling heights, which makes them extremely difficult to divide up, because you get terribly vertical spaces. They were built around safes that were put in the basement as the building went up. Whoever re-leases them has to find a creative new use for the safe -- or a creative way around it."
"The first thing everybody jumps on are restaurants," Ms. Rodgers said, "because they can take 10,000 square feet and they like high ceilings. But there is a problem. Generally, owners like to put something in the space that keeps the image of the building and does not hurt office leasing. Restaurants present their own set of problems, with venting, odors and garbage. And you have to be willing to make a fairly sweetheart deal because the restaurant market is off."
The president of the Fifth Avenue Association, Tom Cusick, is optimistic about empty banks. "I predict they won't last long," he said. "They're very desirable spaces. I think they'll probably be replaced by retailers which is going to help the avenue."
One of the most obvious vacancies is the 12,000-square-foot space left a year ago by Bankers Trust at Fifth Avenue and 44th Street, in a building owned by Silverstein Properties. The floor has been kept open to view -- not hidden behind drawn curtains or painted windows -- and large signs proclaim: "Outstanding Retail/Bank Space Available." Larry A. Silverstein said through a spokesman that he would not discuss the space because it is under negotiation.
The former banking room at Morgan Guaranty, across the street, is going to be renovated and used by the bank, according to a spokesman, although it has not yet been decided exactly in what form.
THE JMB Realty Corporation has just taken possession of the 10,000-square-foot space that the Chase Manhattan Bank used to occupy in a two-story wing of the former Celanese Building, 1211 Avenue of the Americas.
"We'd like a dry-goods, upscale retailer," said Joseph Wright, senior vice president of JMB. "This is the most prominent piece of retail space on the Avenue of the Americas. It's the beginning of Rockefeller Center.
"I don't envision a restaurant there," he said. "Keeping in mind that this is the beginning of Corporate Row, we're going to be very particular about the retail tenant we ultimately select. We have 45 floors we have to be concerned about, with tenants who will walk past this retail space every day."
In the McGraw-Hill Building next door is a 19,000-square-foot space left by Irving Trust. A spokesman for the Rockefeller Group, Vincent E. Silvestri, said that the space was still under lease to the Bank of New York (with which Irving was merged in 1988) and that Rockefeller Center and the bank were "in dialogue" with prospective tenants.
The Manufacturers Hanover space in the Daiichi Fifth Avenue Building, at 57th Street, has been vacant since 1988. The Daiichi Real Estate Company of New York has received inquries from other banks but is "not interested," said Leo Henriquez, vice president of Daiichi America. Instead, the owners are talking to a retailer, he said.
An 11,000-square-foot space in the News Building, at 42d Street and Second Avenue, was converted this year from a Citibank branch into a Sam Goody record store.
"We had a head start and knew it was a unique space," said Barbara Winter, general manager of the News Building and a vice president of LaSalle Partners, the Chicago-based firm that manages the property. She said management benefited from advance notice from Citibank and had engaged in "very active, aggresive" leasing.
"A bank was an obvious choice," Ms. Winter said, "and we definitely surveyed them, but we didn't think they'd be very likely candidates. I've observed what everybody else has observed: Due to technological changes, they need less space. And I saw a fair amount of vacant bank space myself." Because Manufacturers Hanover does not want to foreclose the possibility of reusing or even subleasing its airy, voluminous, second-floor space at Fifth Avenue and 43d Street, it is opposed to the proposed landmark designation of that International style building. Completed in 1954 to designs by Skidmore, Owings & Merrill, the bank has the most visible vault in New York, at street level behind a window facing the avenue.
"DESIGNATION would make it exceedingly difficult to get any economic benefit from recapturing that space or re-leasing it," said Gary Roboff, vice president of distribution services in Manufacturers Hanover's regional banking group.
The palazzo-like Central Savings Bank of 1928 was designed by York & Sawyer, architects of the Greenwich Savings Bank of 1924, which is also on the landmarks agenda, and the Bowery Savings Bank at 110 East 42d Street, which is not. The exterior of Central Savings was designated in 1975. Its huge, vaulted interior is now being considered.
Apple Bank, the Central's successor, has taken good care of this property, even forgoing bullet-proof Plexiglas that would have obscured the wrought-iron work in the tellers' station. But the bank is opposed to designation, although willing to talk with the commission about regulatory guidelines.
"The designation will extend to tellers' cages, work stations and the arrangement of offices," said Shelly S. Friedman of Brown & Wood, lawyers for the bank. "The impact of designation on all of these should be discussed prior to designation."
"The banking floor is the guts of that building's functions," Mr. Friedman said. "The commission may have designated the dining floor of the Four Seasons or Gage & Tollner's, but they didn't designate the kitchen, which is the business center."

HEADLINE: China Gains in Mideast Crisis But Loses Cold War Benefits

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BEIJING, Nov. 10

 BODY:
Less than a year and a half after China's leaders sent tanks and machine guns to crush the Tiananmen democracy movement, Western sanctions are being dismantled and China is regaining status in the international community.
Japan is resuming subsidized loans to China. The European Community last month lifted economic sanctions against China. A group of American Congressmen is expected in Beijing this month for the first time since the crackdown. Countries like Saudi Arabia and Singapore have in the last few months established diplomatic relations with Beijing. 
 "China has withstood the international anti-socialist environment and safeguarded the socialist system," crowed the official New China News Agency.
 While most of the world has suffered from the gulf crisis, China has been a beneficiary. Scholars, diplomats and Chinese themselves say China benefited in two ways: Saddam Hussein's behavior gave the West a new enemy and China won gratitude for its cooperation in imposing sanctions against Iraq.
 
'Best of All Worlds'
 "The gulf crisis accelerated a process that was already under way, of them waiting us out," said a Western diplomat in Beijing. "It's the best of all worlds for them, because they'be been able to reintegrate themselves with the West without sacrificing any third world credentials to do it."
Yet there are signs that over all China is a loser in the geopolitical reordering that has accompanied the end of the cold war. China has lost the leverage it had in playing the Soviet Union and the United States against each other, and its leaders may also be at a disadvantage in an environment in which nuclear weapons matter less than economic strength.
"People don't pay much attention to China any more," a European ambassador said the other day. Most experts agree that China matters less than it used to -- a proposition that drives some Government officials here to alternate between despair and fury. Visiting Americans these days are sometimes greeted with almost obsessive explanations of why China is still of fundamental importance to American interests.
 
Never Much of a Threat
 The West's sanctions were never threatening to China in any fundamental sense. The sanctions included delays in new World Bank loans, a freeze on most military cooperation, and a halt to most high-level exchanges. Ordinary imports from China were never curbed, and in fact they have risen sharply: China's trade surplus with the United States could exceed $10 billion this year, up from $3.5 billion in 1988, before the crackdown.
Military cooperation remains on ice, but World Bank loans are gradually being resumed, and high-level exchanges are increasing. Zhu Rongji, Shanghai's mayor, visited the United States this summer; Wan Li, the head of China's legislature, will tour Great Britain this month; and Wu Xueqian, a politburo member, is leaving in a few days for Tokyo.
"The pace is very slow, but I can see that the direction is toward improvement in relations" with the West, said Yuan Ming, an international relations expert at Beijing University.
In any case, sanctions affected China's relations with only a relatively small number of countries. Most of China's neighbors were uncritical of its behavior and continued to do business with China as before.
In some respects, China now has broader international support than ever: Saudi Arabia and Singapore have newly established diplomatic relations with China, while Indonesia has resumed ties. South Korea will open an office in Beijing very soon, and would like to establish diplomatic relations.
"We were never so upset about the crackdown," said a diplomat from an Asian country that has its own human rights problems. "It's their business."
 
Communist Legitimacy Eroded
 This is not to say that the crackdown on the democracy movement was painless, for the killings of peaceful protesters deeply eroded the Communist Party's legitimacy at home and among Chinese overseas as well as in the West. But some Chinese officials say the hard-liners probably regard the foreign sanctions as an acceptable price to pay, given that their alternative may have been loss of power. The price may be acceptable even if, as many believe, the Government's relations with the West will never again be as warm as before.
"Things will return to business as usual, but that emotional enthusiasm for China won't come back any time soon," a Western diplomat said.
One reason is that while the Bush Administration is gratified by China's cooperation in the Security Council, China's critics are less impressed. Their quarrel with Beijing was not about diplomacy, but about human rights, and they see no fundamental easing of the domestic repression.
While the Bush Administration is expected to favor further dismantling of sanctions, Congress may have other ideas. John T. Kamm, president of the American Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong, expects Congress to make a new attempt next year to end China's Most Favored Nation status. He also is bracing for an effort to establish a code of conduct for American corporations dealing with China.
"We may well find ourselves in a position where Japan and the European Community are lifting sanctions, and we're adding sanctions," Mr. Kamm said.
 
Mutual Resentment and Suspicion
 China wants a resumption of cooperation with the West, but it is wary that too much interaction might again lead to unrest. The resentments and suspicions are mutual and may slow the reconciliation on both sides.
A classified Communist Party document, obtained from a well-connected Chinese in Beijing, conveys these apprehensions. The document, an analysis of international affairs published at the end of last year by the Central Committee Propoganda Department, warns that "the struggle between the two systems" will be prolonged and intense.
"Since the appearance of the first socialist state in 1917, this kind of struggle has never ceased," the analysis reads. "It only varies in its form, intensity and the tactics employed. Now the struggle has entered a new stage, and the struggle will be sharper, more complex and more intense than before. We must be highly vigilant."
While most nations are celebrating the end of the cold war, China has been saying, even before the invasion of Kuwait, that the new environment is not so wonderful after all.
 
Emerging Regional Powers
 One difficulty for China is that a multipolar world is likely to see the emergence of new regional powers including Japan, South Korea, Vietnam, India and Indonesia. China has had wars or bitter disputes with each of these countries in recent decades.
"They've always hailed, in theory, the emergence of a more multipolar world," said Harry Harding, a China scholar at the Brookings Institution in Washington. "But now that it's finally happening, the problem for China is that its relations with many of these emerging poles are rather strained."
Chinese leaders are most anxious about the rise of Japan, which they remember fighting in the 1930's and 1940's, and they often regard Americans as naive in playing down Japan as a military and strategic threat. Some Chinese are even warning that the Soviet Union and Japan could form a threatening alliance in the Pacific, creating a reason for cooperation between the United States and China.
China has clearly lost leverage in that it can no longer play the United States and the Soviet Union against each other. But Mr. Harding says that in a larger sense China has fewer cards to play in a world in which money increasingly seems to matter more than guns.

BAKER TRIP SHOWS COALITION DISCORD ON WAR WITH IRAQ

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PARIS, Nov. 10

 BODY:
Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d's weeklong talks with America's main partners in the coalition against Iraq has demonstrated that there are some very obvious differences over when, and even if, a military operation should be carried out against Iraq, senior Administration officials said today.
Indeed, if there is one overarching lesson from Mr. Baker's eight-country tour, it is that the coalition against Iraq remains solid -- as long as the military option is not imminent. But the closer Washington edges toward using military force, the more the small differences that now exist between coalition partners could develop into major cracks.
Administration officials say they do not think President Bush has decided whether or not to go to war. But his decision to send more than 150,000 more troops to the Arabian Peninsula was interpreted by American marines in Saudi Arabia today as a strong signal that an offensive was growing nearer. [Page 14.]
 
Making 'All Options Credible'
 Mr. Baker in effect acknowledged the problems of maintaining the coalition at his closing news conference in Paris, after his talks with President Francois Mitterrand, when he said, "As we wrap up this trip, I feel that we have a very strong consensus on our collective aims, and on the need particularly to resist partial solutions and on the need to work together and stay together in this coalition and on the need to make all of our options credible, if we are to succeed." 
 But when the Secretary was pressed as to whether there was agreement on the means, particularly when to use the military option, for achieving the aim of a total Iraqi withdrawal from Kuwait, he answered:
"There are some differing views with respect to some of those issues, but generally speaking there is an extraordinary unanimity, and cohesiveness. There are differing opinions with respect to how long it would take sanctions to work. Indeed, there are some different opinions on whether sanctions are already having some bite."
 
Two Camps in Coalition
 Mr. Baker visited with the leaders of Bahrain, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Turkey, China, the Soviet Union, England and France, and while no one can predict exactly what he will tell Mr. Bush when he reports on his trip in the Oval Office, American officials made clear the following points will almost certainly have to be included.
First, two very loosely defined camps within the coalition are clearly emerging: the front-line states immediately adjacent to Iraq and those a long way from the missiles of the Iraqi President, Saddam Hussein.
For the front-line states, particularly Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Syria and Kuwait, there is only one preferred option -- war -- and the only question is whether to do it sooner rather than later, American officials say. This is because these countries have totally exposed themselves by openly coming out against Mr. Hussein, and if he is not destroyed and if his country is not demilitarized, he will destroy them.
As such, these nations see the American military buildup as the prelude to a hoped-for military solution.
For those farther away -- the French, the Soviets, the Chinese and even the Turks -- a very different cost-benefit analysis is being made, American officials say. As these nations assess the costs and benefits of alternative strategies, the majority sentiment is that the low costs and potentially high benefits of trying to force Iraq out of Kuwait with sanctions and increased saber rattling are far preferable to the potentially uncontrolled costs and uncertain benefits of actually going to war. All of these nations feel they can live with a Saddam Hussein contained within his borders.
As French television reported on its evening news Friday night: "Alas for Baker, China is very hostile to any military scenario. Now that a conflict seems quite possible, the French are against it. At the end of September, the supporters of a military intervention were even with the pacifists. Now the latter are clearly a majority. They favor a negotiated solution."
Mr. Baker was worried about the French tilt away from a war option before he visited Paris, and he apparently heard nothing to reassure him.
 
Intimidation Favored
 The Soviets, the French and the Chinese, American officials believe, prefer to see the American military buildup more as a useful tool to intimidate Iraq into a peaceful settlement, rather than something actually to be used.
The second point Mr. Baker brings back from his trip is that when President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt said the decision to go to war should not be made for "two to three months" more, officials say he was voicing the sentiment of virtually everyone Mr. Baker spoke with. The exception was the exiled Emir of Kuwait, Sheik Jaber al-Ahmed al-Sabah, who told the Secretary that he would prefer to see his country liberated "yesterday."
But here again, there are revealing nuances. Leaders of some nations, particularly the Egyptians, Saudis and other gulf Arabs, prefer to give sanctions more time so they would be better able to justify a war to their own Arab publics when it comes, by saying they gave Mr. Hussein every opportunity for a peaceful solution.
Others, such as the French, Soviets, Chinese and Turks, prefer to give more time in the hope that it might change Iraq's behavior or allow for a coup and spare everyone a war.
 
No 'Partial Solutions'
 Third, broad agreement still exists in the coalition against any "partial solutions." At every stop, when Mr. Baker or his aides summarized his discussions, they reported that their interlocutors assured them that they were firm on the point that Iraq must unconditionally withdraw from all of Kuwait. President Mikhail S. Gorbachev and Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze of the Soviet Union, in particular, stressed the importance of Washington's and Moscow's staying totally in step at every stage.
This was reassuring to the Bush Administration, after a month in which some ambigious statements by senior Saudi and Soviet officials had prompted the worry that some of their key allies were ready to make a deal with Iraq. Mr. Hussein has not offered a deal, and whether this solidarity will hold up if he does, remains to be seen.
Fourth, despite the 10 United Nations resolutions and despite the huge buildup of military force, both Soviet and Arab leaders expressed the sentiment that Mr. Hussein has not gotten the message yet. Their consensus was that the Iraqi leader, while he may recognize that he is up against a formidable opponent, still apparently believes that he can split the coalition or make deals, as evidenced by his bartering of hostages last week with German and Japanese envoys.
As a senior Administration official remarked, it is not yet clear, despite all the steps taken so far, that Mr. Hussein's "antennae will be set in a receive mode, or not."
 
Support for More U.S. Forces
 Fifth, as a result, Mr. Baker found no opposition, and much support, for the Administration's decision to make the military option more credible by sending 150,000 more combat troops, hundreds more tanks and three more aircraft carriers. Everyone agreed that unless Mr. Hussein believes that war is imminent, he will not seriously consider unconditional withdrawal.
Mr. Baker also said he had made significant progress with the allies toward coordinating logistics and command plans in the event that there was a military operation.
It has never been clear whether Mr. Baker was collecting opinions on his mission last week, or advocating his own. He has been a voice for caution in Administraton debates from the beginning of the crisis.
Sixth, before any force is actually exercised, there appears again to be a general preference that it be done through the framework of the Security Council, so it will have the broadest political support.
But again, there were important nuances. American officials felt that the British, the Saudis, Kuwaitis and other gulf Arabs were perfectly ready to see military force used without a Security Council blessing, but were of the view that if it was important to Washington, it was fine with them.
 
No Push for U.N. Measure Now
 The Chinese, Soviets, Turks and French, however, clearly felt that a Security Council resolution authorizing force was a necessity, because it would give them both political cover if war comes and a greater say in the timing and scope of any combat. Still, none of them publicly indicated any desire to see such a resolution now, because it would bring the war option that much closer.

Gulf Crisis Produces Surge of Egyptian Confidence

BYLINE: By JUDITH MILLER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CAIRO, Nov. 9

 BODY:
Despite its ailing and heavily indebted economy and lingering Arab resentment of its decade-old peace treaty with Israel, Egypt is experiencing a surge of self-confidence with the Persian Gulf crisis and what Egyptians see as their pivotal role in Arab efforts to end Iraq's occupation of Kuwait.
"Egypt is up now," said Taseen Bashir, a former Government official. 
 "There is no doubt that Mubarak has benefited from this," Adel Hussein, the editor of Al Shaab, an opposition daily, said of President Hosni Mubarak.
Cairo's active role against Iraq is the result of a shrewd calculation of its political and financial interests, reinforced by Mr. Mubarak's palpable bitterness over what he calls President Saddam Hussein's deception about his intention to invade Kuwait.
 
Dividends for Egypt
 Mr. Mubarak's stand has produced dividends for Egypt. First and most important, the United States and several Arab nations have agreed to cancel at least $14 billion in military debt -- about 25 percent of Egypt's overall debt. France and other European states have promised to consider similar action.
The debt forgiveness will substantially reduce the hundreds of millions of dollars in interest payments that Egypt has had to shoulder for its whopping $50 billion debt. Washington's decision to cancel $7.1 billion in military debt, for example, means a savings of some $700 million a year in repayments. Few diplomats expected that Egypt would have been able to make the payments.
"For the first time in years the cold hand of death is not at the throat of the Central Bank," a senior diplomat said.
Saudi Arabia and other Arab nations have pledged new financial aid. While the exact figure is not known, Makram Mohammed Ahmed, chief editor of Al Musawar, a semi-official magazine, said that Riyadh has promised to finance major new Government development projects and that $500 million of a Saudi commitment of $1.5 billion in aid has already been received.
The United Arab Emirates is said to have pledged $600 million in aid, and the Gulf Cooperation Council, a military and political group made up of Saudi Arabia and smaller gulf states, is reported to have pledged between $1 billon and $2 billion in development aid during Mr. Mubarak's tour of the Persian Gulf in late October.
 
A Windfall From Oil
 As a modest oil exporter of about 200,000 barrels a day, Egypt is enjoying a windfall of about $100 million a month from the recent surge in oil prices, an Egyptian official said.
The funds will help to offset an estimated $4.5 billion in lost revenue stemming from the gulf crisis and the expected decline of Egypt's three largest sources of foreign currency. They are remittances from as many as 4 million Egyptian workers in the gulf, 270,000 of whom have returned from Iraq and Kuwait; tourism, which Mr. Mubarak said was off by 80 percent, and Suez Canal revenues, which are expected to decline by about 20 percent, or $300 million.
Diplomats also said Egypt and the International Monetary Fund would soon conclude an agreement after protracted negotiations aimed at reducing Cairo's huge food subsidy program and social-welfare budget. They said such an accord would provide new standby credit, enabling Cairo to reschedule part of its remaining debt.
 
Mubarak Given High Marks
 Egypt's political high is not only the result of the financial relief. Since the country has often been on the verge of economic catastrophe for the past 150 years, political stability and confidence matter enormously here. And Mr. Mubarak, while not viewed as a charismatic figure in the Egyptian tradition, is nevertheless given high marks by a wide cross-section of Egyptians for his political stewardship, and specifically for what analysts called his "principled" stand on the gulf.
One reflection of Mr. Mubarak's popularity is his decision not to use the crisis to postpone the parliamentary elections later this month. His National Democratic Party is expected to win the overwhelming number of seats in Parliament, particularly because several major opposition parties, citing unfairness in the election system but privately fearful of being trounced, are boycotting the election. Still, some members of parties that are ostensibly boycotting the contest are running as independents.
Throughout his tenure before the gulf crisis erupted, Mr. Mubarak's unflamboyant and cautious policies were credited with gradually building bridges to other Arab states that had ostracized Cairo over its peace treaty with Israel. Egypt has restored diplomatic ties throughout the Arab world and has been allowed to rejoin Arab organizations like the Arab League.
Mohammed Abdel Moneim, the presidential press secretary, said Mr. Mubarak's stance on the gulf crisis had shown that "it's not Israel that can be counted on in an inter-Arab confict."
"Now the whole world -- the U.S., Europe, and even the Arabs -- realize that a strong Egypt is a great stabilizing element in the region," he said.
Still, Egyptian analysts and diplomats see problems ahead. Many fear that Mr. Mubarak may use the temporary financial relief to postpone unpopular but vital changes that must be made if Egypt is to develop and attract foreign and domestic investment. "Hosni Mubarak is still very cautious, and most of his aides are mediocre," Mr. Bashir said. "There is very little land reform, very little perestroika."
 
A Stultifying Bureaucracy
 By all accounts, Mr. Mubarak has made little headway in lessening the stultifying impact of Egypt's bureaucracy.
Rules are still rules in Egypt, whether or not they make sense. Several opposition newspapers recently noted, for example, that thanks to Egypt's unflagging adherence to bureaucratic procedures, thousands of traffic policemen were now sweating through their workdays because rules required them to switch on Nov. 1 from their white cotton summer uniforms to winter wear -- heavy woolen outfits -- even though temperatures last week soared into the upper 80's.
Mr. Ahmed of Al Musawar said Egypt faced an increased threat of terrorism because of its position on Iraq. Rifat Maghoub, the Speaker of Parliament, was assassinated last month with his driver and bodyguards at midday in front of a luxury hotel. Although the attack has been attributed to a domestic Islamic extremist group -- 10 of whose members have been arrested -- Mr. Ahmed said the security police believed that Iraq, among others, has begun pouring money into Egypt to foment terrorist actions.
Several analysts complained about widespread apathy over the coming elections, lack of trust between the Government and the public, an aging and ineffective opposition, and a political system that had little place for younger, vibrant people.
"The same old tired faces are still with us," said Walid Kazziha, a political science professor at the American University of Cairo. "They push old ideas and new places for themselves. What we have here is democracy by default. The problems have become so enormous and unmanageable that the central government can no longer control things anymore."
 
Worry About the Military
 Mohammed Sid Ahmed, one of the country's liveliest intellectuals and opposition figures, said he was concerned that the gulf crisis might bolster once more the role of the military in public life. "Nasser, Sadat, and Mubarak were all military men," he said. "Mubarak has yet to name a vice president, so we don't know whether he, too, will be military. I fear that army is reacquiring status at the expense of the civilian structure."
This trend would be reinforced, he warned, if there were a war in the gulf.
Finally, while most analysts agreed that Mr. Mubarak had become more confident because of the crisis, several expressed concern that he was becoming slightly "pharaonic," like Gamal Abdel Nasser and Anwar el-Sadat, his predecessors. .
"Egypt does not need another pharaoh," Mr. Bahir said. "They're mummified, and I want them to stay that way. I'll take a living president who recommends and suggests, not one who only knows how to give orders."

HEADLINE: Japanese Labs in U.S. Luring America's Computer Experts

BYLINE: By GINA KOLATA

 BODY:
To the dismay and chagrin of many scientists, leading Japanese computer and electronics companies are opening laboratories in the United States to do basic research, luring some of the most creative American computer scientists to work for them.
Some researchers and economists see this as a direct threat in the one area of computer science where Americans still have a distinct advantage. These critics say the Japanese effort could reduce the quality of research at universities and damage the competitive position of the United States in a critical field that frequently devises the striking innovations that translate into tomorrow's products. 
 But others say the competition for the relatively few stars in the field of theoretical computer science is natural and could be beneficial for science.
 
An 'End of the World' View
 "People's reactions to this vary from those who say the Japanese are wasting their money because they don't know what to buy to those who say it's the end of the world," said Dr. Charles Ferguson, an analyst at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, who studies the computer industry. "I think it's closer to the end of the world."
Japanese companies have not focused on basic research, said Seigi Hinata of the Japanese Consulate in New York. "But increasingly we are putting more efforts, more investment, into basic research," he said. And much of that effort in computers apparently will take place in the United States, using American scientists.
The NEC Corporation has opened a research laboratory in Princeton, N.J. Matsushita is going to open one next year near San Francisco. Canon is starting one in Palo Alto, Calif. Mitsubishi is talking about starting one near the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge. American scientists say they have also received job feelers from administrators at two other Japanese companies, Fujitsu and Ricoh, that have told some computer scientists that they are considering starting laboratories in this country.
 
Sites Near Universities
 The Japanese companies are considering sites adjacent to universities with leading computer science departments, where theoreticians have developed startling ways to solve difficult problems. These can translate into practical products like high definition television or programs for the next generation of computers.
When they approach scientists from these universities and from places like A.T.&T. Bell Laboratories, the Japanese offer very high salaries and an opportunity to work with the most advanced computer technologies, which even the best universities cannot afford.
In return they get scientists who are the best in the world.
"The Japanese have not generated world-class theoretical computer scientists," said Dr. Ronald L. Graham, a research administrator at A.T.&T. Bell Laboratories. "The world players are in this country."
Some researchers fear that by hiring America's senior scientists, the Japanese are depleting an already sparse supply of experts. Computer science is a young field with few leading researchers, said Dr. Robert Sedgewick, chairman of Princeton's computer science department. "I'm talking about less than 50 people that everyone could endorse," he said.
The loss of senior academic scientists to Japanese research laboratories could greatly hurt the universities, Dr. Sedgewick said, especially if the top scientists turned around and hired some of their colleagues to join them.
 
Best Ideas Will Be Patented
 Another concern is that although the Japanese companies say that much of the work will be published in scientific journals, they also acknowledge that they will claim patents on the researchers' best ideas. As a result, American scientists could end up helping Japan compete economically against the United States.
On the other hand, said Dr. Robert Lawrence, an economist at the Brookings Institution in Washington, the Japanese laboratories may ultimately be good for American science, bidding up the price for researchers and making universities and industrial laboratories strive harder to make their jobs attractive.
Dr. Lawrence said he found the strong reaction to the Japanese efforts puzzling. "There has been a lot of condemnation of the Japanese for not engaging in enough research and development in this country," he said. "People have criticized their foreign investment as only bringing in screwdriver tasks," meaning that the Japanese have invested in factories. But now, as they invest in research, they are criticized. "They're damned if they do and damned if they don't," Dr. Lawrence said.
 
Mohammed Comes to Mountain
 But administrators at several American reserach laboratories affiliated with industry said they feared that the Japanese may have an unbeatable strategy.
"I think they're extremely clever," said Dr. Ram Gnanadesikan, an assistant vice president for mathematics, communications and computer science research at Bell Communications Research, the division of the Bell operating companies that were split off from A.T.& T. "The United States still has the advantage in software research and development. So rather than try to duplicate that in Japan, they've come to us and are starting labs where the human resources are located. It's like Mohammed and the mountain."
American scientists say they are awed by the salaries that Japanese firms are offering. "They're paying substantially more than any other job in academics or industry," said Dr. Thomas Leighton, a computer scientist at M.I.T. who has had informal, preliminary talks with Mitsubishi.
Dr. Leighton, Dr. Graham and others said the Japanese companies offer salaries that are 20 percent to 30 percent higher than the best offers the scientists could get from universities or American laboratories. Researchers said typical offers were more than $250,000 for senior scientists and about $70,000 for people with fresh Ph.D.'s from leading universities. "We just can't compete with salaries," said Dr. Joseph Traub, a computer scientist at Columbia University.
 
An American Recruiter
 Many American computer scientists say they are intrigued with the Japanese effort and are not averse to working with Japanese companies. Matsushita has even enlisted an American computer scientist, Dr. Michael Harrison of the University of California at Berkeley, to help recruit America's brightest.
"They came to me a year ago and said they wanted to start a research lab in the states," Dr. Harrison said. He said he had already established a relationship with Matsushita when the firm invested in his company, Cayenne Software, so he was favorably inclined.
Matsushita officials told Dr. Harrison that "they wanted a laboratory so good in computers and software that it would realize the promise that Xerox could have had if it had carried through its program," Dr. Harrison said. He referred to Xerox Palo Alto Research Corporation, known as Xerox Parc, which is legendary in the industry.
Scientists there came up with major creative ideas but failed to follow through by developing products. The concepts behind the MacIntosh computer, for instance, were developed from Xerox research, he said, but ended up being marketed by Apple Computer Inc.
Dr. Harrison said he believed the Japanese laboratories would ultimately help American research. The Japanese "will bring their technology over here and that will improve our technology," he said.
Matsushita is negotiating to persuade Dr. Richard Lipton, a 44-year-old star of Princeton's computer science department, to head its laboratory. Dr. Lipton, who has spoken at length to the Japanese, said he was seriously considering the job.
 
New Technology Is a Lure
 "A lot of us are interested in working with state-of-the-art technology," he said. "We don't really get access to it when we are at a university. We tend to work with things that are a generation behind."
Dr. Lipton said the salary being offered was attractive, although he declined to say how much it was. "Obviously, the salary is an issue," he said. "A lot of that has to do with incentives to make you move."
Dr. William Gear, who was hired away from the University of Illinois to be vice president for computer science research at NEC, said he was attracted to the Japanese company because it offered an opportunity for long-range research, without constantly searching for financing. University research is tied to Federal grants, which run for just a few years.
Even American research laboratories have been focusing on short-term goals, Dr. Gear added. "In earlier years, one would look to Bell Laboratories or I.B.M. or Xerox Parc for longterm research. But the amount of that seems to be lessening," he said.
 
Some Are Reluctant
 Not everyone who was approached by Japanese companies leaped at the opportunity, although those interviewed asked not to be identified because they did not want their current employers to know they were entertaining outside offers.
One computer scientist at a university said he turned down NEC because he would have been uncomfortable working for a Japanese company. "I am a refugee," he said, "and I feel a great debt to the United States."
These reluctant scientists may be exceptions. Dr. Harrison said that although he had tried to keep a low profile word was out that he was helping Matsushita recruit, and that he has been getting calls from job-seekers.
"There are a lot of unhappy campers at Xerox Parc," Dr. Harrison said. "Some are very, very aggressive. One guy calls me every couple of weeks."

HEADLINE: SUNY Chief Weighs Spring Tuition Increase

BYLINE: By SAMUEL WEISS

 BODY:
Faced with the prospect of a new round of budget cuts, the Chancellor of the State University of New York is considering recommending an increase in tuition of $50 to $100 for the spring semester, university officials have said.
Tuition for the university system, the nation's largest, is $1,350 a year for state residents. It has not been raised for New York students since 1983, and has never been raised in the middle of an academic year. 
 Any tuition increase would need the approval of the Legislature and Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, as well as the SUNYboard of trustees. Opposition from the Governor has prevented increases in the last two years. But Mr. Cuomo indicated several times during the course of his re-election campaign that he might agree to an increase now because of the state's budget problems.
University officials who declined to be named said that administrators have for several months been discussing a possible tuition increase of several hundred dollars a year, starting next September. But recently, the officials said, Chancellor D. Bruce Johnstone's staff has begun planning for an increase of $50 to $100 for the spring semester to help offset an anticipatedcut in funds for the current fiscal year, which ends March 31, as the state tries to reduce spending to close a growing budget gap.
 
Administration Seeks Cuts
 On Oct. 30, the Cuomo administration projected that the state would spend $824 million more than it expects to take in for the current fiscal year, and the Governor ordered a general freeze in state hiring and awarding of contracts. The state's budget director, Dall W. Forsythe, also directed all state agencies to submit plans last week for cuts totaling 3, 5 and 7 percent of their budgets. University officials have declined to divulge details of their plan.
In an interview last week, Dr. Johnstone refused to disclose what the university's plan would contain but acknowledged that there had been "a lot of discussion" about a possible spring tuition increase. He said the issue would be raised at a meeting of the university's trustees on Thursday.
Dr. Johnstone said a recommendation for a mid-year increase would depend on the size of the budget cut sought by the state, a decision expected to be made in the next few weeks.
"If you're discussing budget cuts of $25 million, $30 million or $45 million," he said, "it becomes preferable at some point to start talking about a tuition increase rather than something like faculty layoffs."
Judith Krebs, the president of the State University Student Associationand the student representative on the university's board of trustees, said she expects that "the university's response will include a request for a tuition increase." She said she objected to making students bear the brunt of the state's economic difficulties.
University officials noted that the state's contribution to the current SUNY budget of $1.49 billion is already $39 million less than last year's, and said that a 3 percent to 7 percent cut would represent a further reduction of $35 million to $75 million. A tuition increase of $100 would make up about $14 million in revenue, they said.
If the university's trustees approved a spring increase, it would still have to be authorized by the Governor and the Legislature, which is expected to be called into special session sometime in December to deal with the growingbudget problems.
Spokesmen for Governor Cuomo, Assembly Speaker Mel Miller and Senate Majority Leader Ralph J. Marino all declined to comment on a possible tuition increase.

HEADLINE: GUATEMALA BALLOT MARKS WATERSHED

BYLINE: By LINDSEY GRUSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: GUATEMALA, Nov. 10

 BODY:
Barring a collapse brought about by the wave of political violence now afflicting Guatemala, the general elections on Sunday and the inauguration of a President in January should mark a democratic watershed: the first transfer of power from one elected civilian to another in the country's history.
That would be a significant step for the United States-backed effort to end a tradition of military dictatorship and build a working democratic system. 
 But Western diplomats say the political violence illustrates President Vinicio Cerezo Arevalo's failure to gain control over the armed forces and end the institutionalized terrorism that limits political expression to the right and the extreme right.
"The only left here is in the mountains," said Juan Francisco Alfaro, secretary general of the Confederation of Guatemalan Union Groups, the largest labor organization in the country, in referring to a three-decade-old guerrilla movement.
 
Only Hints at Reform
 Most leading candidates have announced ambitious programs to stabilize the foundering economy. But they have not dared to do more than hint at plans for demilitarization, agrarian reform, population control or land redistribution. Such programs would address the problems most often cited as the causes of the pervasive poverty and political repression that have led to two decades of war and bloodshed.
The results have been growing apathy and hopelesses in the face of growing violence, a resurgent guerrilla movement and corruption by the ruling Christian Democrats. Increasingly, Guatemalans equate democracy with anarchy and yearn for the strict hand of military government.
"People are asking themselves: Is this what we wanted? Is this the system we fought for?" said Edmond Mulet, a senior opposition deputy. "There's enormous frustration. In only five years the whole system is besieged. Whatever happened to our dreams?"
In a startling turnaround from the national jubilation that greeted Mr. Cerezo's 1985 election, polls now find a five-point preference for military regimes over democratic governments. But the army, which squashed two right-wing coup attempts against Mr. Cerezo, is expected to accept any of the three leading candidates.
 
A Wealthy Front-Runner
 Polls show that the front-runner is Jorge Carpio Nicolle, a wealthy newspaper publisher and founder of the National Center Union. In an effort to broaden his appeal in the private sector, he enlisted as his running mate Manuel Ayau Cordon, a businessman who started as a presidential candidate of the far-right National Liberation Movement.
Senior members of the National Center Union have acknowledged that it was unlikely that the ticket could win the absolute majority needed to avoid a runoff in January. That has made the campaign into a scramble for second place between Alvaro Arzu, the wealthy former mayor of the capital and the ex-president of the National Liberation Movement, and Jorge Antonio Serrano, an evangelist and the president of the council of state during the regime of the dictator Gen. Efrain Rios Montt.
 
The General's Reputation
 Mr. Serrano has benefited from the collapse of the general's own candidacy, which ended last month when the Supreme Court upheld the constitutional provision barring former dictators from power. In the most obvious sign of the country's disillusionment with democracy, the general was until then the front-runner, even though thousands of civilians were killed during his rule in the early 1980's. But his 16-month tenure is now remembered more for stability than for bloodshed.
The national dissatisfaction seems to have buried the chances of Alfonso Cabrera Hidalgo, the candidate of the ruling Christian Democrats, who by law may not renominate the President. Mr. Cabrera's campaign has faltered since he was stricken with pancreatitis earlier this month.
Mr. Cerezo spent his first two years as President pushing demilitarization and Guatemala seemed to be fertile soil for democracy. But Guatemalan politicians say their President appeared to give up and became content to finish his term. He stopped going regularly to his office, and his aides were replaced by girlfriends who surrounded him in what has been described as "a thicket of pretty legs."
Violence began to mount. In the first nine months of this year, there were 276 political murders and 145 disappearances, according to the congressionally appointed Human Rights Ombudsman.
Mr. Cerezo has described the human rights abuses as the final spasms of a dying era. But many Guatemalans blame the President, saying he allowed himself to become a captive of the army. They note the military staffs his country estate, providing even the servants. When aides went to see him there earlier this year, they said they were required to park their cars and ride the last two miles on Army buses.
"He became the caged pet of the army," Jorge Skinner Klee, a senior opposition Congressman, said.
But some diplomats say Mr. Cerezo came to rely on the army because it is the only bureaucracy that works. He asked civilian aides two years ago to prepare his position papers for a summit meeting in Mexico. They never produced. Finally, he turned to the army. It had a series of detailed plans on his desk within a week.

HEADLINE: THE 1990 ELECTIONS;
Governors Facinga Fiscal Squeeze and Tough Choices

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 10

 BODY:
Governors elected this week on a wave of popular discontent over rising taxes will soon be squeezed by fiscal pressures even more severe than those that forced their predecessors to increase taxes.
The successful candidates for governor face bigger fiscal problems than their predecessors for three reasons. The economy has slowed to a standstill. Congress has just imposed new spending requirements on the states as part of a vast bill intended to reduce the Federal budget deficit. And voters in many states have made clear that higher taxes are unacceptable. 
 Under a policy of "new federalism" championed by Presidents Reagan and Bush, the Federal Government has heaped responsibilities on the states in the last 10 years. But the recent economic slump has depleted state coffers of the revenue needed to carry out the responsibilities.
 
More Tax Increases Likely
 "President Reagan transferred the authority and the responsibility and the fiscal burdens to the states, and the governors were forced to raise taxes," said Larry J. Sabato, a professor of government at the University of Virginia.
Steven D. Gold, director of the Center for the Study of the States at the State University of New York in Albany, predicted that "there will be a large number of state tax increases next year," even though voters dislike them. Governors will cut some state programs, but will face irresistible demands for new state spending on Medicaid and prisons, he said. The nation's war on drugs has filled state prisons far beyond the capacity for which they were designed.
Twenty-six states increased taxes for this fiscal year. State officials estimated the new taxes would generate $10.3 billion in additional revenue this year. New Jersey, New York and Massachusetts will account for half the extra revenue.
 
Six Incumbents Defeated
 Six Governors, including four in the Middle West, were defeated, and taxes were a major issue in most of the 14 states where control of the governor's mansion shifted from one party to another.
Even in New Jersey, where the Governor was not on the ballot, voters angry over $2.8 billion in state tax increases took out their wrath on Senator Bill Bradley, who won re-election by a slender margin. In other states, voters punished candidates for governor whom they associated with higher taxes.
Raymond C. Scheppach, executive director of the National Governors' Association, said, "Voters' amorphous frustration about the Federal budget deficit and taxes gets translated to the state level because voters hold state officials more accountable than members of Congress."
 
Governors Feel Voters' Wrath
 That analysis is supported by the results of Tuesday's elections. The success rate of incumbents seeking re-election was 97 percent for members of the United States Senate and House of Representatives, but only 74 percent for governors.
William F. Weld's first step after being elected Governor of Massachusetts was to call for repeal of a sales tax enacted under Gov. Michael S. Dukakis, a Democrat who did not seek re-election. Mr. Weld, a Republican, reaffirmed his campaign pledge of "no new taxes" and said he had won because of his promise to bring "tax relief to the working men and women of Massachusetts."
A major factor in the defeat of Gov. Bob Martinez in Florida was his position on taxes. Mr. Martinez, a Republican, was badly hurt by his support in 1987 for a new tax on advertising, construction and other services. He reversed himself and won repeal of the tax, but allowed increases in the sales tax and other levies.
Republicans blamed for higher taxes in Kansas and Nebraska lost bids for re-election as governor, and a taxpayer revolt helped bring down a Democrat who had served two terms as Governor of Michigan.
In Kansas, Gov. Mike Hayden, a Republican, presided over a revision of property tax laws that sent tax bills soaring in many parts of the state, and the successful Democratic challenger, Joan Finney, exploited voters' anger over those tax increases.
 
'Don't Be Fooled Again'
 In Nebraska, Gov. Kay A. Orr was held responsible for increases in the state income tax. The Democratic candidate, Ben Nelson, charged that Mrs. Orr had reversed a no-tax pledge, and he told voters, "Don't be fooled again."
The successful candidate for governor in Ohio, George V. Voinovich, derided his Democratic opponent, Anthony J. Celebrezze Jr., as "Tax-Hike Tony." He charged that Mr. Celebrezze favored a "billion-dollar tax increase." Mr. Voinovich, a former Mayor of Cleveland, seized on comments by Mr. Celebrezze to suggest that the Democrat would repeal a 1976 law protecting Ohio homeowners against property tax increases resulting from inflation in property values.
In Michigan, the Republican candidate, John Engler, unexpectedly defeated Gov. James J. Blanchard, whom he accused of having presided over an increase in property tax assessments. Mr. Engler promised to cut property taxes by 20 percent, saying people deserved to "keep more of what they earn."
In Rhode Island, voters ousted a three-term Republican Governor, Edward D. DiPrete, who had reversed himself on a pledge of no new taxes. With the state's economy in a tailspin and unemployment rising, the Democratic challenger, Bruce G. Sundlun, won handily with 74 percent of the vote.
 
Illinois Is an Exception
 Illinois was one of the few states where voters rejected a candidate for governor who promised tax relief. They chose Jim Edgar, a Republican, over Neil Hartigan, a Democrat, even though Mr. Edgar said he would try to persuade the State Legislature to retain a 20 percent surcharge on state income taxes.
Mr. Hartigan tried to exploit anti-tax sentiment and said the surcharge should be allowed to expire in June 1991. Mr. Edgar said he did not want the surcharge to expire because public schools and colleges desperately needed the money.
Candidates who rejoiced over election returns this week will soon anguish over state finances. Gerald H. Miller, executive director of the National Association of State Budget Officers, said: "There is an immense squeeze on state government. The governors are being asked to put a size 10 foot in a size 8 shoe, and it doesn't work."
"The economy is in a recession," Mr. Miller said. "State revenues are down. But demands on the expenditure side of the budget are up because states serve the poor, and in a recession there are more poor. At the same time, we are being asked to serve more people because of mandates from the Federal Government."
 
Costs of Medicaid Increase
 The National Conference of State Legislatures says the Federal budget bill signed Monday by President Bush will increase state costs by $17 billion over five years, in part because it requires states to expand Medicaid, already one of the largest and fastest-growing programs in state budgets.
Medicaid, which provides health care for 24 million low-income people, is financed jointly by the Federal Government and the states. It accounted for 12 percent of all state spending, was the second biggest component of state budgets, after education, and grew 19 percent in the fiscal year just ended.
The president of the National Conference of State Legislatures, Lee A. Daniels, who is also leader of the Republican minority in the Illinois House of Representatives, complained that "the Federal solution is to send the bills for deficit reduction to the states."
States are supposed to be partners in the Federal system, but "we were not at the bargaining table in the budget negotiations, and now state and local governments are being forced to pay the price," Mr. Daniels said.
 
'Invading State Revenue Bases'
 The Speaker of the Maine House of Representatives, John L. Martin, a Democrat who is president-elect of the state legislators' group, said the Federal Government was "invading state revenue bases" by increasing excise taxes on gasoline, cigarettes and alcoholic beverages.
Under former President Ronald Reagan's proposal to realign Federal and state responsibilities, Federal officials were to consult more closely with state and local officials, and Washington was to help finance programs sent back to the states by giving up certain excise tax revenues. Governors say they got the new responsibilities, but no more revenue and no closer consultation.
A survey of the states, issued last month by the National Governors' Association, found fiscal distress spreading westward from the eastern United States.
Mr. Gold of the State University of New York said, "Trends in state tax revenue suggest that many states are in recession or skating on the brink of one."
Corporate profits are considerably lower than last year, and 29 states report declines in corporate income tax collections, Mr. Gold said. The other major sources of state tax revenue, the personal income and general sales taxes, are bringing the states less money than expected because wages, salaries and consumer spending for goods and services of all types have grown much less than expected, he added.
Governors facing painful choices might look to Virginia for guidance. There, Gov. L. Douglas Wilder, a Democrat, is laying off state workers, canceling pay raises, deferring construction of public works and cutting state aid to local governments and private museums.
"He has been adamant from his first day in office -- no tax increase," said Paul W. Timmreck, State Secretary of Finance. " His emphasis is entirely on cutting spending."

A Marine General Speaks To Troops of an Offensive

BYLINE: By JAMES LeMOYNE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: IN SAUDI ARABIA, Nov. 10

 BODY:
A senior American military commander here told his troops today that it is now possible that they will launch an offensive against Iraq in the months ahead.
The statement, by Maj. Gen. Robert M. Johnston of the Marines, a leading member of the American command in Saudi Arabia, was repeated by other senior officers today as they reacted to President Bush's decision to send at least 150,000 reinforcements to Saudi Arabia "to provide an adequate offensive military option" if economic sanctions against Iraq are deemed insufficient. 
 Speaking on the 215th anniversary of the founding of the Marine Corps, General Johnston said the President's decision to send additional units, and not to permit any rotation of the 230,000 American military personnel already here. meant that now "we may indeed have to concern ourselves with an offensive option" against Iraq.
It appeared to be the first explicit acknowledgment by an American officer that the former limited goal of defending Saudi Arabia was giving way to a new imperative to prepare a possible attack. Since they first arrived here in August, American commanders have denied making any offensive preparations.
 
Comparison With Vietnam
 Addressing the assembled ranks of the First Marine Division headquarters battalion, General Johnston warned his troops that they faced "a whole new ball game" and that a war in this region could be more difficult than the war in Vietnam.
"The prospect of offensive combat is going to be the greatest challenge that Marines have seen in many decades," he said. "We are going to need everything we have if we go to war against the Iraqis."
Under military rules, the precise numbers and locations of American units cannot be reported. But the Marine forces visited today are among the most forward-deployed combat units in the Saudi desert.
General Johnston and other senior officers said they had not yet fully informed American troops here of the decision not to permit any units to rotate home as reinforcements come in.
"We just got the message last night," said another Marine commander, Brig. Gen. Mike Myatt. "I think it's going to have a sobering impact."
 
Stiffened Resolve?
 When asked their reaction to the decision to send reinforcements without rotating soldiers home, several marines seemed surprised but also relieved at what they interpreted as a stiffening of resolve.
"That tells us one thing," said Cpl. James M. Capps of the Third Marine Regiment at a base far out in the desert. "If they say it's an offensive, we're ready to go."
It was an acceptance of battle echoed by several marines who said they would rather fight than sit in the sands indefinitely.
"We know a war is a war," said Sgt. Frank Huerta, 28 years old. "Some of us won't make it back. But we say, 'Let's do it so the rest of us can get home.' "
As he spoke, a combined British and American military band was playing "The Marine Hymn" while officers used a combat knife to cut a birthday cake emblazoned in red letters spelling out former Marine battlefields: "Wake, Tarawa, Iwo Jima, Vietnam." Each marine ate a piece of a similar cake in a ceremony repeated across the desert today among more than 40,000 men sent here with the First Marine Expeditionary Force.
 
An Important Ingredient
 General Johnston, a 30-year veteran, told the marines that the First Expeditionary Force would be "the pointed end" of any offensive against Iraq.
When asked what he thought their reaction would be to the policy of not rotating them home, he said: "I'm sure it's not going to thrill a lot of people, but we're mature enough to carry out the mission."
Mood matters in war, where the battle in men's minds and hearts is as important as the weapons they wield. By that measure, there appears to be a marked change from two months ago in the marines met today at several bases across the desert.
They complained very little. Some admitted fear and many said they wished they were home with those they loved. But they had a quietness about them and a tautness.
"We think we're ready," said Pvt. Lionel Tetreault, 20. "We all want to do well, but you can't tell how you're going to do until you're in it. That's just how it is."
 
Desert Turns Cooler
 Several marines said they are grateful to have had three months to grow used to the desert, which has become agreeably cool with the approach of winter.
At another ceremony, Brig. Gen. Thomas B. Draude told the men of the First Battalion of the Third Marine Regiment that they must now prepare "to go in harm's way."
"Things are a little different than they were a week ago," General Draude said, elaborating on the sober tone of his statements.
After the general spoke, a Marine chaplain led a brief prayer.
"Father, we have come to this desolate and forbidding place from comfortable homes," the chaplain said, his head bowed toward troops who listened with rifles slung over their shoulders. "We stand on the brink of war," the chaplain said. "We pray for peace."

DATELINE: BRATTLEBORO, Vt.

 BODY:
George Bailey lives.
Bailey, as movie fans know, was the main character in the 1946 classic "It's a Wonderful Life." Portrayed by James Stewart, he heads a savings and loan that invests in the good folks of Bedford Falls while resisting the temptation of greed. 
 That fable is being played, for real, in this picturesque New England town where 36-year-old Robert E. Schrull heads the Brattleboro Savings and Loan Association, doing battle as an old-time home mortgage lender.
In the movie, Mr. Bailey's faith and honesty were rewarded at Christmastime when the townspeople rescued his little savings institution with cash -- an early savings and loan bailout. Mr. Schrull's institution is in better shape. But it remains to be seen whether his story will have an ending as happy as George Bailey's.
As Mr. Schrull is finding, it is is not easy running a savings and loan that stayed honest and stuck to its original purpose when many others did neither. Depositors are pulling out their money -- nearly $4 million by last tally -- in part, Mr. Schrull thinks, because of the bad image of the industry. Federal regulators are inundating Mr. Schrull with red tape and stiff new assessments. A downturn in the New England economy means fewer people want mortgages. And bankers and Washington politicians are saying that community institutions like this one are a dying breed -- too small and specialized to compete.
Vermont has only four savings and loans and none got into trouble, unlike those in Texas and points west. Yet Mr. Schrull, who drives a Jeep with the license plate "THRIFT," feels the heat. He recalls telling a California couple visiting a nearby country inn that he ran a savings and loan, and the wife replied, "Oh, you're a crook." Then there was the evening he dined at the bar at the Lobster Pot, a politicians' hangout in Montpelier, the state capital, and overheard patrons lambasting the savings and loan industry. He never told them what he did.
Mr. Schrull is fighting back with a combination of clever marketing and rock-solid adherence to the principles of community banking befitting George Bailey.
"It may be surprising," Mr. Schrull said in his office on Main Street, "but there are a few small honest community institutions left."
Just recently, Mr. Schrull opened a branch at the local high school using students as tellers. He gives a $5 savings account to every baby born in town so that "no one is born broke in Brattleboro." And, like George Bailey, he relishes making "heart" loans to local borrowers who may have a blemish or two on their credit rating but are otherwise solid citizens. He said only one of these had gone bad in 10 years.
"I know it sounds corny, but there needs to be a segment that focuses strictly on housing loans," he said. "I'm content to do that, even if we don't make as much money as we could. If we pool our money here in Brattleboro, we can help Jane or Joe buy a house, and I haven't taken my eye off that focus."
That plays well in this town of about 12,000 in the heart of southern Vermont's ski country. "Bob Schrull and his bank give people here personal attention," said Linda Dirks, head of the Brattleboro Chamber of Commerce. And Chester Dix, who operates Stockwell's General Store in West Brattleboro, terms Mr. Schrull "a very brilliant young man."
"It's local people investing local money in his bank," said Mr. Dix, who had an account at Brattleboro Savings and Loan, founded in 1912, when he was a child and now accepts deposits for the institution at his store. "It's not a commercial enterprise. It's like it's ours."
Mr. Schrull's notion is to cement his ties to the community and make money on the difference between what he pays local depositors and what he lends to others to buy their homes. A native of Stamford, Conn., and a graduate of the University of Massachusetts, he came to Brattleboro Savings more than a decade ago, having decided to live in Vermont and make a career in banking. He started as marketing director and was picked by the institution's elderly president as heir apparent.
 
No 'Junk Bonds'
 Throughout the 1980's, when savings and loans were freed to invest in all kinds of high-flying businesses, Mr. Schrull resisted temptation. He chose to build up the savings and loan's cash reserves rather than grow quickly through risky investments. He never bought "junk bonds," did not make loans on commercial real estate and shunned taking deposits from outside the Brattleboro area. "It just didn't seem like things we should do," Mr. Schrull said. "I just said no."
Instead, he opened branches in country stores, vowed never to get rid of the passbook and real, live tellers, and made mortgages with a personal touch. "If it makes sense, I'll make a loan," Mr. Schrull said. "A lot of other banks forget about the average Joe Six-Pack."
He held his own by offering depositors a slightly higher rate than did rival banks. As a mutual savings and loan, Mr. Schrull's institution gives its profits back to depositors in the form of higher rates and retains what is left as earnings.
 
'Heart' Loans
 He also competed through his "heart" loans that other banks might not touch. Unlike many other savings and loans and banks, he never bunched his mortgages into packages and sold them to outside investors. This, too, limited his growth because when loans are packaged and sold, an institution can make more loans without encroaching on regulatory limits. However, it enabled him to offer specialized loans -- on offbeat properties or to trustworthy people with a spotty credit history.
As a result, 90 percent of Mr. Schrull's assets are invested in first mortgages on homes in the Brattleboro area, far more than the 70 percent requirement in the Federal bailout legislation.
 
Strong Numbers
 To a large extent, his down-home strategy has paid off. Brattleboro Savings and Loan has grown to $35 million in assets from $8 million 10 years ago. Its cash reserve is strong and the association's return on equity -- the amount earned on the bank's capital -- is 15.02 percent, about twice the national average.
Now, with his cash base secure, Mr. Schrull wants his institution to grow but finds it cannot. Given the softness in the New England economy, fewer people are buying homes. And depositors are slowly but steadily withdrawing their money.
Mr. Schrull is not sure why, although he knows that many New England banks are seeing the same trend as the economy weakens and depositors dip into their savings. But he wonders whether the stigma of being a savings and loan is contributing. Profits, around $170,000 a year in the mid-1980's, fell to about $160,000 in 1989, but are expected to rise to more than $200,000 this year because overhead was reduced.
 
Washington Pressures
 Mr. Schrull feels that forces in Washington are against him. Many politicians and banking experts are saying the days for small-town institutions are numbered because big commercial banks can do the job just as well. "There is no rationale, five or ten years from now, to having a separate thrift industry," said Charles E. Schumer, a Brooklyn Democrat who is an influential member of the House Banking Committee.
The 1989 bailout legislation also brought in a platoon of fresh regulators from the newly created Office of Thrift Supervision, along with a new annual assessment -- $16,300 for Brattleboro Savings and Loan -- to cover the cost of this new regulation. This comes on top of an insurance premium -- $47,000 in Brattleboro's case -- that must be paid to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, which also examines Mr. Schrull's institution.
 
A Waste of Time
 Mr. Schrull thinks the Office of Thrift Supervision regulators only duplicate the F.D.I.C., but less efficiently. He recalls once spending three weeks writing a computer program they wanted only to have them change their minds.
Ralph Gridley, the agency's director in Boston, said Mr. Schrull's comments were "not surprising."
To get out from under the Office of Thrift Supervision, Mr. Schrull is trying to convert his institution into a state savings bank, but his application is still pending. Even if it is approved, he plans no changes.
"I want to have the same mission of making money the old-fashioned way," said Mr. Schrull, who lives with his wife and two small children in a modest Cape Cod house in nearby Putney.

California Politicians Reel After a Vote Limiting Terms

BYLINE: By SETH MYDANS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SACRAMENTO, Calif., Nov. 8

 BODY:
On the same day they returned most incumbent legislators to office, the people of California voted to throw them all out, approving a ballot measure on term limits that exploded like an antipersonnel bomb in the Capitol here.
The ballot measure, Proposition 140, which was approved Tuesday by a vote of about 52 percent to 48 percent, sets limits on the tenure of officeholders in the nation's most populous state and cuts the budget of its Legislature by nearly half. 
 Ballot measures limiting the number of terms of elected officials, which are viewed here as a protest against Washington as much as against local politicians, were also approved on Sept. 18 in Oklahoma and on Tuesday in Colorado.
At the same time in California, 87 out of 92 legislators who were running for re-election were returned to office.
Barring a successful challenge in the courts, the new law will force all 120 incumbents in the State Senate and State Assembly to give up their seats over the next eight years, and the ranks of the 3,200 professionals who make up their staffs will be severely thinned.
 
What the Law Does
 The law limits the 80 members of the Assembly to three two-year terms and the 40 State Senators to two four-year terms. The Governor and other elected statewide officials are already limited to two four-year terms.
It also removes legislators from a state pension system that has been paying retired legislators up to 67 percent of their salaries.
Supporters argued in the campaign that entrenched legislators, under the thrall of special interests, had reached a state of gridlock on issues like crime, transportation, taxes, public finance and the environment.
"Somebody has got to just blow the whistle and say, 'Time out -- all you guys have just got to go home,' " said Lewis K. Uhler, president of the National Tax-limitation Committee, a private lobbying group, who helped draft the measure.
 
An Opposite View
 But the men and women who spend their lives in the complex system of government took an opposite view, saying it would leave the Legislature shorn of its most experienced people.
"It means the quality of legislation will deteriorate, we are going to lose good people, the Legislature is going to have a more difficult time doing its job and the public is going to suffer for it," said Cliff Berg, executive officer for the State Senate's Rules Committee. "It will strengthen the ability of the Governor and the executive branch and the lobbyists and the special interests and the bureaucracy to dominate policy decisions."
The powerful, longtime legislative leaders who were the lightning rods for public anger in the campaign vowed to fight back in the courts, contending that term limits are unconstitutional because they deprive people in legislative districts of the right to choose their own representatives.
These leaders, David Roberti, President pro tem of the State Senate, and Willie Brown Jr., the Assembly Speaker, have held sway over the Legislature for a decade. Both are Democrats.
Lawsuits over the issue may take years, and political analysts say that until they are resolved, the cuts in legislative staffs may have to proceed when the law takes effect next July.
The vote has devastated morale among staff members who have made a career of preparing and analyzing legislation and who provide expertise on issues ranging from the economy to social services.
"People are really depressed," said Steve Larson, the staff director for the State Senate's Budget and Fiscal Review Committee, who has made legislative work a 20-year career. "It's funny: you go up to meetings and your mind just wanders off. You ask yourself, 'What does this really matter?' "
John Griffing, chief consultant to the Joint Legislative Budget Committee, compared the mood with the sense of doom he had encountered as an economist observing plant closings. "People here feel like they've been kicked in the teeth," he said. "It hurts. It hurts your pride."
He added: "We all have complaints about the Legislature. It's a difficult place to operate -- it's this huge committee. But it's the way we make public policy in the United States. So people who get in and figure it out and make it work take a lot of pride in the work. And then when the public turns around and slaps them down, it hurts."
 
Unpredictable Consequences
 Eugene C. Lee, a professor of political science at the University of California at Berkeley, said it remained unclear just what the voters had in mind, apart from sending an angry message.
He said the consequences of that message are unpredictable. "In a very fundamental sense," he said, "we don't know what we're getting because this is an experiment."
And in this sense, said Hal Dash, president of Cerrell Associates, a consulting firm, "it's the ultimate abuse of the system -- it's reform gone amok."
One effect of the law, Mr. Dash said, will be a Legislature of newcomers and lame ducks. "It's going to create the ultimate revolving door," he said.
Among other effects, Mr. Larson said, is that the new law will rob the Legislature of its most experienced and skilled members.
"In the budget process, experience gives you a tremendous leg up," he said. "You know what's a bad idea when you see it. You know where the bodies are buried. You know what's going on in terms of the bureaucracy and the administration."
 
Other Likely Effects
 Other possible effects of the legislation were being discussed here today.
The measure, which has the effect of weakening the legislative branch, will give more power to the already dominant executive branch. Relations with the incoming Governor, Pete Wilson, will be particularly strained because he endorsed it.
In addition, the makeup of future legislatures is unclear. Proponents of term limits say a clean sweep will make room for more women, minority leaders and "citizen legislators" who are closer to their constituencies. But opponents say it might discourage the most-qualified candidates, who could not accommodate six- or eight-year mid-career sabbaticals.
Paradoxically, the law might enhance the job security of incumbents who seek re-election after their first terms. Rather than mounting expensive campaigns against them, challengers may simply wait until their term limits have been reached.

HEADLINE: SCRANTON MAY CUT WORK FORCE 50%

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: SCRANTON, Pa., Nov. 10

 BODY:
 This city, hometown of Gov. Robert P. Casey, is facing a fiscal crisis, and the Mayor says it could reduce the municipal work force of 650 people by about half, with the layoffs starting as early as next week.
The Mayor, James Connors, offered that forecast Friday night, only hours after unions representing the city's firefighters, police officers and public works employees had rejected a health-benefits proposal intended to save the municipal government $1.5 million. 
 Mr. Connors said that the city had enough money to meet only its payroll for this week and that in light of the unions' rejection, the layoffs appeared imminent. He said that although he would search for other options, tax increases would not be among them.
"At some point," he said, "someone has to represent the citizens, someone has to represent the taxpayers."
The layoffs could mean the loss of 100 firefighters, 70 police officers, 30 clerical workers and 78 public works employees.
 
Bond Sale Was Blocked

The financial crisis was spawned when a Lackawanna County court refused last week to allow the city the rare step of selling $4.5 million in bonds to finance payroll expenses. The city had assumed approval of the sale when it enacted its current budget.
Eugene Carroll, president of the Fraternal Order of Police local here, said his membership had voted against the city's health-care plan by 111 to 16. Mr. Carroll called the plan a "giveback" and a violation of the union's contract.
When asked what advice he would give to the city's residents, who may see a drastic shrinking of their police force, he said, "Buy a gun, lock your doors, and keep your children off the street."

HEADLINE: Angel Island Journal;
Saving Voices of the Other Ellis Island

BYLINE: By KATHERINE BISHOP, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ANGEL ISLAND, Calif. Nov. 8

 BODY:
Paul Q. Chow re members that when he first learned in school of the great flow of immigrants from Europe to America through Ellis Island, he went home and asked his mother where their people arrived in this country.
He recalls how she became upset and replied in a hushed tone: "Angel Island. Shhhhhh." 
 For a long time, the small boy believed there was a place called Angel Island Shhhhhh where 175,000 people of the ancient Pearl River villages were welcomed to the new land they called "Golden Mountain."
It would be many years before he learned about the immigration station on this island in San Francisco Bay that was not a reception center but rather a place of detention and potential deportation from 1910 to 1940. It was here that officials and immigrants played out a complex dance, tens of thousands of times: the officials charged with enforcing laws aimed at keeping most Chinese out, and the immigrants trying to circumvent those laws.
The immigration station was closed 50 years ago this month. Mr. Chow and other Americans of Chinese descent are trying to raise money to restore it as an important if painful history lesson. Their task is made more urgent by their wish to preserve hundreds of Chinese poems written on or carved into the walls of the men's barracks by anonymous authors expressing their anguish.
"The generation that went through it wants to forget it," said Mr. Chow, a 62-year-old retired worker with the state transportation department. "It's the first and second Chinese-American generations that says, 'This was shameful and you put my parents or grandparents through this and it should not be forgotten.' "
The first wave of Chinese immigration occurred after the discovery of gold in California 141 years ago. Here they worked for 12 cents an hour laying the tracks of the Central Pacific Railroad and reworking the gold claims abandoned by white miners.
Dismissed from their jobs on completion of the transcontinental railway in 1869, they were bombed and lynched by people who blamed them for the high unemployment that followed the Civil War. The racist fury culminated in the passage of the Chinese Exclusion Act in 1882: the first law denying naturalization to members of a specific ethnic group.
But a window reopened when the fire that followed the 1906 San Francisco earthquake consumed records of the births and businesses of Chinese. Residents of Chinatown came forward to claim fictitious children in China and received documents that allowed whole villages of relatives and strangers, the "paper sons and daughters," to come to America.
But when they arrived at Angel Island, they were separated by sex and penned in into cramped barracks, then subjected to intense questioning. Some were kept here for a year or more, and stories, not confirmed by island records, say some hanged themselves rather than face deportation.
Mr. Chow's father arrived in 1922 with his own mother, who had been born in the United States but had lost her American citizenship because she married a Chinese national. They were detained on the island for six weeks and were freed after paying a bribe of $550, Mr. Chow said.
The 750-acre island became part of the state park system in 1965, and the immigration station was scheduled for demolition until a park ranger noticed the Chinese characters inscribed on the barracks walls. Asians pressed for preservation of the inscriptions, and the State Legislature created a study commission headed by Mr. Chow.
Other Asian-Americans have worked to keep the memories from dying. In 1980, 135 of the poems were translated and collected by Him Mark Lai, Genny Lim and Judy Yung in a book, "Island," and in 1988, Felicia Lowe made a documentary film, "Carved in Stone."
The poems show that some of the detainees considered returning to China. Others spoke philosophically of their detention. And there are rare sparks of anger. A poem signed "One From Taishan" reads:
It is unbearable to relate the stories accumulated on the island slopes.
Wait till the day I become successful and fulfill my wish!
I will not speak of love when I level the immigration station!
"We are happy with the idea of having money to restore it," said Gregory Picard, chief ranger for the Marin District of the State Department of Parks and Recreation, which administers the island. But with a $16 million projected shortage in their budget this fiscal year, "if money doesn't come from outside sources, it won't come at all," he said.
It is this reality that helped turn Mr. Chow into what he calls "the poor man's Lee Iacocca," attempting to raise $3 million to rehabilitate the station in a low-budget version of the Chrysler Corporation chairman's efforts on behalf of Ellis Island.
He is also driven by the memory of bringing his father to the station in 1975. He said his father, then 75 years old, entered the gutted men's barracks and walked immediately to the place where his bunk had been.
"It was the first time I ever saw my father cry and the first time I ever put my arms around him," Mr. Chow said.

Nixon's The One

BYLINE: By Anna Quindlen

 BODY:
On Halloween night one of the neighborhood dads was dressed as Nixon. The mask was lifelike, down to the 5 o'clock shadow, and the costume was exact: dark suit, white shirt, quiet tie. As he shepherded his children down the street he flashed me the double V with his upraised hands, the Nixon digital signature that was so near to the peace sign and yet so far.
"Terrible costume," I said. 
 "I know," the counterfeit replied in a credible imitation of the Nixon voice, the voice that would have belonged to a basset hound had Watergate been an animated cartoon instead of an American tragedy.
There are so many obvious reasons for the current anomie of voters, from a crippled economy to the rotten campaigns to a feeling of the same old guys doing the same old things. But I keep thinking that if a political psychoanalyst put some of us on the couch, some of us who make up that bulge in the population known as the baby boomers, the doctor would find a buried key in the past to our immutable distrust of elected officials. And the key would be Richard M. Nixon.
Need I modify him? For those of us who grew up in his shadow, he will always have only a surname, as the truly famous do. Once, playing some trivia game, an opponent drew the question "What is Richard Nixon's middle name?" and we became irate. Surely there could be no one in their 30's, no one who had known moratoriums and student strikes, who could not reply "Milhous," who did not know the significance of Whittier College, who could not tell you what event took place on Aug. 9, 1974.
Nixon was our introduction to government. He taught us that politicians were always other, people deeply unlike ourselves. Our parents believed we would outgrow our dislike of him, just as we would outgrow rock-and-roll. They were wrong on both counts. It is commonplace to think that the pivotal leader of our formative years was John F. Kennedy. But Kennedy was never much more than fleeting myth, the epitome of what might have been; Nixon became what was.
When we think of the war, when we think of the draft lottery, when we think of the enemies list and the President bugging himself, even when we think of the mothers who said, "If that skirt was any shorter you'd be naked" and the fathers who said, "You can cut that hair or you can find another place to live," hovering over all is Nixon. The image of him walking on the beach in a suit and lace-up shoes became a metaphor for everything we hated. He was the ultimate adult at a time when adult had become the greatest pejorative.
You can get a good argument going at a liberal gathering these days about who was more pernicious, Richard Nixon or Ronald Reagan, the canny lifelong politician or the vague, paternalistic pitchman. Ronald Reagan's winning nowadays. But then something happens to remind you that, in terms of sheer symbolism, there's no contest: Nixon's the one.
A few days ago the people who run the Nixon Library announced that they were postponing display of those two definitive Watergate tapes, the ones we shorthand "cancer on the Presidency" and "stonewall it." The library director said they had other, more pressing business -- expanding the display of Pat's gowns. It seemed so Nixonian, that decision, burying harsh realities beneath a patina of appearance. "So it still goes on the way it was," said one political scientist of the suggestion that sequins are more historically significant than obstruction of justice.
It leaves a peculiar mark on people, when the most memorable political figure of their youth is best known, not for something like "The only thing we have to fear is fear itself," but for the disclaimer "I am not a crook." I will never forget watching the resignation speech on TV, in an apartment building occupied by Columbia University faculty and students. At the words "Therefore, I shall resign the Presidency effective at noon tomorrow" I could hear faintly the sort of cheers and clamor that are audible at midnight on New Year's Eve.
Last year I was having my photograph taken by a famous photographer, a man with a ponytail and a liberal sensibility. And he told me of taking Richard Nixon's picture. He said that before they began, the two chatted, and that he was struck by how smart and personable the man was. Suddenly he could understand how history might rate the former President's achievements more judiciously and his place in history more favorably than we ever could. Finally they were ready to start, and the photographer looked through the lens for the first time.
"Suddenly," he recalled, "I saw Nixon."
There was no need for him to say more.

HEADLINE: Too Far Too Fast in the Gulf

 BODY:
President Bush has supplanted a defensive strategy in the Persian Gulf with what sounds like a unilateral declaration of offense. Pleading a need to provide an "adequate offensive military option" against Iraq, Mr. Bush has ordered 150,000 additional U.S. troops to Saudi Arabia. And now the Pentagon has decided not to rotate the troops already there until the crisis ends.
All told, the buildup would double the combat units already deployed -- and increase the risks of a war the President insists he does not seek. So fundamental a change in U.S. strategy cries out for something more than a cursory announcement to startled reporters. 
 At home and abroad, President Bush has won impressive support for a collective policy of threatening the economic strangulation of Iraq. Now, patience frayed, he has suddenly doubled the military stakes. Why the abrupt shift? Why move so fast before existing measures have had time to work? And why move so far without first winning Congressional support -- and the moral and legal heft of a United Nations resolution authorizing the use of force?
 Mr. Bush's best argument is that the alliance needs to convince Saddam Hussein that he has no choice but to submit to U.N. demands for an unconditional pullout from Kuwait. It makes tactical sense to persuade Iraq that the allies aren't bluffing. But Saddam Hussein can read the world press. Mr. Bush's announcement seems meant to sound tough abroad, but at home his aides are quick to assure Americans that there's little chance U.S. forces will go to war.
Mr. Bush's new threat would be more credible if it grew out of open debate in America and formal U.N. support that seems within diplomatic reach. Secretary of State Baker seems to have succeeded in his present mission to persuade the coalition partners to press harder on Baghdad. He has been notably less successful in persuading them to send more forces to serve in Saudi Arabia.
The gravest danger is that the buildup will create irresistible pressure for war. The new forces will be in place by January. They will require the mobilization of yet more reserves. Once these vast forces are deployed, it will be hard for Mr. Bush to remove any troops before achieving his objectives without appearing weak-kneed. The disruption of American lives and the economy can only add to the pressure to get things over with.
War with Iraq would be costly, with Americans bearing the heaviest casualties. The political risk of an Americanized war is that the Arab world would not soon forgive or forget destruction inflicted on fellow Arabs. Even in defeat, Saddam Hussein could enjoy a victory, as Arabs in the streets proclaim him a martyred Saladin.
As Americans learned in Vietnam and the Russians learned in Afghanistan, the consequences of a foreign war are only conjectural until the shooting starts. It should be the goal of diplomacy to use the threat of war to prevent war, not hasten it.
If this is Mr. Bush's purpose, he needs the understanding and support of the American public. His purpose is surely justifiable; Saddam Hussein's aggression cannot be allowed to stand. But when Mr. Bush dictates a new offensive policy with barely a nod to Congress or the public, he shows more imperial impatience than unified strength.

HEADLINE: The Drug Czar's Coherent Legacy

 BODY:
It's not clear how much praise William Bennett, the nation's first drug czar, deserves for glimmers of hope that the nation's crack epidemic may have peaked. But there is no denying the intelligence he brought to a tormenting struggle marked by ignorance and confusion.
The Office of National Drug Control Policy, created by Congress in 1988, always suffered from inflated expectations. There are no quick or dramatic solutions to the nation's nightmarish crack problem, and in any case, the czar, a mid-level official, is in no position to order around members of the Cabinet. Nor can he command more resources than a President is willing to provide. 
 Thus Mr. Bennett filled much of his time traveling nationwide to deliver relentless anti-drug lectures. And his tendency to shoot from the lip brought justified criticism. Even in the press conference to announce his resignation last week, he could not resist calling Representative Charles Rangel a "gasbag."
But those who dismissed Mr. Bennett as a publicity seeker overlooked an important point: The former Education Secretary had done his homework. He brought a capacity for thorough study and rigorous analysis to the daunting complexities of drug abuse and trafficking.
He quickly recognized the inefficiency of Reagan-era border interdiction tactics that had hogged a huge portion of Federal spending while yielding minimal results. He understood the importance, and cost-effectiveness, of community policing to reclaim neighborhoods ravaged by drugs.
Critics asserted that he neglected treatment. But if he hesitated, it was as an academic aware of research showing some approaches more effective than others. During his regime, Federal money for treatment nearly doubled to $1.5 billion.
That it didn't rise more was in part because Mr. Bennett also saw the genuine possibilities of attacking the drug supply at its source with military and economic aid to producer countries. With the Governments of Colombia and Bolivia mounting aggressive campaigns of their own, that made sense.
During Mr. Bennett's 19-month administration, statistics began to reveal tantalizing signs of progress. Monitors of drug-related emergency room visits and urine tests of criminal suspects showed declining cocaine use. And in the Andes, thousands of farmers sought help to shift from coca to other crops. Prices of finished cocaine in U.S. cities began to climb while purity fell.
None of this signaled anything like victory -- drugs continue to blight lives and communities across America. Nor is a favorable turn of the statistics necessarily the result of Federal policy. Apparent peaking of demand for crack may reflect no more than the natural limits of a market.
But Mr. Bennett still can claim credit: after years of official bewilderment, he and his staff brought hardheaded coherence to thinking about drug abuse.
With public attention shifting to the economy and the Persian Gulf, the next drug czar may find it hard to gain a hearing. That would be too bad. If anything, the encouraging statistics argue for an intensified effort. But at least the next czar, and the nation, are left with a solid intellectual base.

Frank Discussion Of Sex Problems Draws Hundreds

DATELINE: ANN ARBOR, Michigan

 BODY:
Sororities and fraternities at the University of Michigan held two Sexual Awareness Days last month that attracted more than 300 members who held frank discussions on a variety of subjects often avoided on college campuses.
 Among the topics were methods for preventing date rape, resources available to vicitms of sexual assault, and alternatives to sexual intercourse as a preventive to A IDS, including abstinence. Representatives from each of the universities 38 fraternities and 20 sororities participated in the program, held in the Sigma Chi fraternity house.
 
 "Part of the goals of the Greek system should be to educate members on every type of social issue. That includes sexual awareness," said Scott Edwardson, co-chairman of the event. "As far as I know, we are the only Greek system in the country to run this type of program with a campuswide involvement."
 The program, the second one at Michigan, was not intended to reach all fraternity and sorority members directly, said the initiator, Eric Reicin, a senior from Highland Park, Ill., who is majoring in international economics and political science. "We want everyone to learn something today and go back and share it with their fellow members.' he said. "In the future we hope to offer smaller and shorter programs for each house that we can individually tailor to meet its particular needs."
 
'It Shows That We Care'
 Organizers reserved the first day's program for new sorority and fraternity members and pledges. Juniors and seniors attended on the second day.
 Mr. Edwardson, a junior from Kalamazoo, Mich., who is majoring in industrial operations engineering, said, "This may not combat the negative image of fraternities, but it shows that we care."
 Counselors from the university's Sexual Assault Prevention and Awareness Center helped small groups discuss methods for preventing date rape. Many of the groups concluded that when couples communicate their expectations for the evening effectively, date rape is less likely. Others decided that avoiding potentially dangerous situations was the best defense.
 Discussion leaders added that the center's 24-hour telephone line was available to all sexual-assault victims and that a team of two counselors, both women, could be dispatched to the scene of an assault quickly.
 Sylvia Hacker, an assistant professor of nursing, led a discussion centering on the AIDS virus.
 
Some Are Troubled
 After her speech, Ms. Hacker said, "I thought the audience was extremely receptive." But some participants were troubled by the program as a whole.
 "I was happy to see that people are aware of these issues," said Colleen Clinton, a junior graphic-arts major from Farmington, Mich., "but I was really disappointed that there was such a high ratio of women to men. A lot of men came downstairs for the free pizza and went right back upstairs."
 Sean Deegan, a junior from Ann Arbor, Mich., who is majoring in English, said, "Some people took this seriously, and most didn't. For the most part, you can tell they didn't because so many people left early."
 The fraternity's front room was packed to capacity for both days' opening lectures but was only about half full for the final workshops.
 But some participants delcared the day a success.
 "Absolutely, this program made a difference," said Jeffrey Kirschner, a freshman from Villanova, PA. "We weren't pounded with, 'This is bad, this is bad,' like in high school."
 Lisa Hart, a nursing major from Farmington Hills, Mich., said: "I learned a lot of things I thought I knew already. The people who are here wanted to be here. It's not easy to give up a Sunday afternoon in college."

Will Tuesday's Disaffection Become Rejection At the 1992 Polls?

BYLINE: By R.W. APPLE Jr.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
IT is a mistake to try too hard to project the results of midterm elections forward two years to the next Presidential election. Inevitably, the context changes. The issues come and go.
Between now and 1992, for example, the economy will either emerge from its difficulties or it will not. The perilous situation in the Persian Gulf will either be resolved or will become much worse. In any event, issues like those, plus some others that cannot be foreseen now, are likely to dominate the headlines and shape the results in the next White House race, not the budget tangle or President Bush's flip-flops. 
 Four Presidents since World War II have won an election, then seen their party lose seats in the House of Representatives two years later, then run again -- Dwight D. Eisenhower, Richard M. Nixon, Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan. Two of them, Eisenhower and Carter, lost ground in the Senate as well.
But there was no correlation at all between what happened to them in the midterm balloting and what happened when they sought re-election. In fact, the two biggest losers -- Eisenhower, with a deficit of 18 House seats, and Reagan, with a loss of 26 -- were two of the biggest second-term victors of the era.
Still, there was remarkable agreement among political professionals last week, after an election in which the President's Republicans lost a senator and eight seats in the House, that something new was afoot, even though for the fourth straight election more than 95 per cent of House members who sought re-election were successful. That something was real, deep dissatisfaction with Washington.
Among others, Edward J. Rollins Jr., the co-chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee, said that he expected the disaffection "to grow rapidly, not to go away, over the next two years."
Roger Ailes, who made Mr. Bush's 1988 television commercials and is often credited with electing him, said that "a sleeping giant has awakened." The voters, he said, are "trying to tell the politicians that there are things they don't like, and they may be on the verge of seizing control of the political process for the first time in many years, by voting with their heads instead of just their hearts."
The message was muffled this time. Most incumbents won, but their margins of victory were smaller, and even some of the big names were shaken. "Because of the disparity in financial resources and all the structural advantages of incumbency," said Peter Hart, a leading poll taker for Democrats, "the message arrived by second class mail, not by fax or Federal Express. But in 1992, in a Presidential year, rebellion could explode. The problems are there -- the economy, war and peace, the political system."
Interviews by The New York Times and CBS News with voters leaving the polls all across the country last Tuesday certainly suggest that the electorate is more than superficially miffed with politics as it is now practiced. Fully 76 per cent said they were dissatisfied with the way Congress was doing its job, 71 per cent said they thought there should be a limit on how many terms members of Congress could serve, and 65 per cent said they trusted the government in Washington "to do what is right" only some of the time or never.
Mr. Bush did better, getting a 59 per cent approval rating, but that didn't help the Republicans much, the survey showed, because 64 per cent said the President was not a factor in the way they voted for House candidates. He campaigned for Republican gubernatorial nominees in Florida and Texas, two of the three key states in this campaign, and worked hard for Senator Rudy Boschwitz of Minnesota; all three lost. Only the victory of Republican candidates for governor in the Midwest and Senator Pete Wilson's triumph in California, the single most important battleground of 1990, eased the pain.
The 1992 contest is getting under way later than any in two decades. But begun it has, with the creation of an exploratory committee last week by friends of Gov. Douglas Wilder of Virginia, which raised the possibility that the Democrats might have two black hopefuls. The other possibility would be Jesse Jackson, who gained his first elective office last week as an unpaid District of Columbia "shadow Senator."
Real action, however, will probably not start until early next spring, less than a year before the caucuses in Iowa and the primary in New Hampshire.
Among the Democrats who regularly crop up on lists of potential Democratic candidates, a pair of northeasterners, Gov. Mario M. Cuomo of New York and Senator Bill Bradley of New Jersey, stubbed their toes with less than impressive victories. Mr. Bradley's best-known expertise is in the politically perilous field of taxation, so he may have some trouble clawing his way back, and Mr. Cuomo faces the prospect of a fiscal crunch in Albany that may force him to do things, like raising taxes or cutting services or both, that would make it hard for him to sell himself to the nation, if he decides to try.
Governors are on the line every day in this time of unpalatable choices, and they have fewer resources at hand, partly because the Reagan Administration curtailed the flow of Federal money to state capitals, partly because the economy is shrinking. This year, 14 governorships shifted from one party to another; two years from now looks like an inopportune moment for governors to be seeking the Presidency, although Gov. Bob Casey of Pennsylvania impressed a lot of people with his million-vote victory margin.
For all that, and despite his failure to break the Republicans' hold on the state Senate, Mr. Cuomo is counted the favorite by most Democratic professionals, not least because of his ability to make at least some liberal ideas palatable to the middle class. He sounded every inch the candidate in an interview with The Associated Press on Friday, criticizing Mr. Bush for not "sending the same kind of energy into the economic struggle as he's sending over to the sands of Arabia."
A pair of Southern Democrats, Senators Al Gore Jr. of Tennessee and Sam Nunn of Georgia, won easily, and kept their positions near the top of the list. Senator Charles S. Robb of Virginia is another possibility from that part of the country, which seems certain to produce at least one active candidate.
Senator Robert Kerrey of Nebraska, a nascent dove on Iraq who won the Congressional Medal of Honor in Vietnam, might be propelled by events into the race, and Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri is another Midwestern possibility if Congressional leadership does not prove to be a stigma. Lloyd Bentsen, the 1988 Vice Presidential nominee, will be 71 years old in 1992, but he is lean and fit, and if the recession proves severe, his expertise as chairman of the Senate Finance Committee could help.
Mr. Bush will almost certainly draw opposition in the primaries. Richard A. Viguerie, the conservative money-raising expert, announced the day after the election that "the inquest begins now" in the Republican party. But Jack Kemp, the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, says he isn't interested, so the challenge is likely to be more irksome than truly threatening, more like that of John Ashbrook against Richard Nixon in 1972 than that of Ronald Reagan against Gerald Ford in 1976.
One lesson drawn by many conservatives from the election results was that the President should never have abandoned his "no-new-taxes" pledge. So he went right back to it at a news conference on Thursday, as a first step in what he termed the "remedial work" facing himself and the Republican party. "He's lost some of his credibility in the last month or so," said John Sears, who managed Mr. Reagan's 1976 effort. "He has to be sure in the next couple of years that when he takes a position, he stays with it. Otherwise he'll end 1992 in a bad way."
To put the same point in other words, the campaign just ended proved Mr. Bush vulnerable. It suggested strongly that the issues are there for the Democrats to exploit, if they can find an effective standard-bearer and unite behind him. More than that about the 1992 race it is difficult to say, except perhaps to recall that at this stage in 1970 Edmund S. Muskie looked like a sure thing and at this stage in 1974 few people knew Jimmy Carter's name.
 
SOME WINNERS AND LOSERS
 
There's a reason that the national parties poured millions of dollars into state-level races this year: where seats in the House of Representatives are to be gained or lost after the census, the party in charge of the state is in charge of the new Congressional map. Following are the projected gains and losses in seats from the nation's 13 largest states, based on preliminary Census Bureau figures, and results from last week's voting.
 
California: +7
 
Pete Wilson's victory keeps governorship in Republican hands, insuring opposition to the Democratic-controlled Legislature. State Republicans are still mindful of losses after the 1980 Census, when Democrats had the governor's seat, too. Partisan clashes this year were muted, however, as the moderate Mr. Wilson faced the moderate Dianne Feinstein.
 
New York: -3
 
The only question was whether Pierre A. Rinfret, the reluctant Republican candidate, would finish ahead of the Conservative Party's Herbert London, thus keeping the Republicans on the second row of state ballots. He did. Gov. Mario M. Cuomo won with a disappointing 53 percent and will once again face a Republican Senate. The Assembly remains Democratic.
 
Texas; +3
 
Ann Richards, the Democratic half of one of 1990's nastiest campaigns, took the Governor's seat away from the Republicans in her narrow, come-from-behind defeat of Clayton Williams, a businessman and political newcomer. The Democrats control the Legislature, too, so they should have an easy time drawing new Congressional districts to their liking.
 
Florida; +4
 
In a race that the Republican Party fought hard, Democratic former Senator Lawton Chiles unseated Gov. Bob Martinez, who had switched parties several years ago. Democrats control both houses of the Legislature as well and will control redistricting, although the electorate is increasingly Republican, particularly in the fast-growing coastal areas of the state.
 
Pennsylvania; -2
 
Gov. Bob Casey, a Democrat, defeated State Auditor General Barbara Hafer with 68 percent of the vote, the largest margin in half a century. The vote bolstered Democrats but failed to wrest the Senate from the Republicans. The Democrats' stronghold, Philadelphia, is shrinking, and an ugly fight over new districts in the area is anticipated.
 
Illinois; -2
 
The governorship remains in Republican hands, after an odd race in which an anti-tax Democrat from Chicago, Neil Hartigan, lost narrowly to a pro-choice, downstate Republican, James Edgar, who pledged more money for schools. But Democrats continue to dominate both houses of the General Assembly, insuring a rough reapportionment battle.
 
Ohio; -2
 
The Republicans took over the Governor's seat as former Cleveland Mayor George V. Voinovich defeated State Attorney General Anthony J. Celebrezze. Republicans control the Senate and the Democrats the House. The 1982 redistricting was bipartisan, but with a Republican Governor now, the process figures to be more contentious.
 
Michigan; -2
 
As in Ohio, Republicans gained leverage. The Democratic Governor, Jim Blanchard, unexpectedly lost to John Engler, a conservative state legislator. The Legislature remains split, portending a tough reapportionment fight. The Detroit metropolitan area, where Republican suburbs surround a Democratic city, is expected to lose at least one seat.
 
New Jersey; -1
 
Gov. Jim Florio, who sailed into office last January and promptly pushed tax increases through, was the focus of nearly every race. The Democrats paid for the voters' anger at the Governor -- Senator Bill Bradley barely won, and Republicans gained in local offices -- but they still control the Legislature and can probably minimize their losses in reapportionment.
 
North Carolina; +1
 
This year, all attention was on the Senate race as Harvey Gantt, former Mayor of Charlotte, lost a heated contest to the incumbent, Jesse A. Helms. Republican Gov. Jim Martin was not up for re-election. Democrats control the Legislature, but Republicans have a strong presence, especially in counties where growth would logically place a new Congressional seat.
 
Georgia; +1
 
Democratic Lieut. Gov. Zell Miller comfortably defeated Johnny Isakson in the Governor's race, although Mr. Isakson's 45 percent was the strongest gubernatorial showing in years for a Republican. The Democratic Legislature should dominate redistricting, but the fastest growth is in Atlanta's Republican suburbs and a new seat there may be unavoidable.
 
Virginia; +1
 
Democrats are firmly in charge. The Governor, L. Douglas Wilder, took office in January and has been widely popular. The party also controls the Legislature. On Tuesday, one of the state's 10 Congressional seats changed hands; Stan Parris, a conservative Republican from the Washington suburbs, lost to James P. Moran Jr., the Mayor of Alexandria.
 
Massachusetts; -1
 
Registered Democrats outnumber Republicans by four to one, but in the Governor's race many defected from John Silber to the milder-mannered Republican, William F. Weld. Mr. Weld will be at odds with the Democratic Legislature on many counts, including his promise to roll back taxes; the voters turned down a tax-cut proposition on Tuesday.

Among War's Problems: It Would Be A Hard Sell

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN

DATELINE: TAIF , Saudi Arabia

 BODY:
IF Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d's visit to the Saudi desert last week demonstrated anything about America's ability to go to war against Iraq, it is that the Bush Administration could still face a tough time justifying the costs to the American people.
If war breaks out, the Administration's political Achilles heel could well lie in the stark contrast Mr. Baker was exposed to: The American troops he visited Sunday are dug in on the harsh Saudi desert floor, while the Kuwaiti ruling family he visited Monday is ensconced in the Presidential Suite of the Taif Sheraton Hotel. In wartime, it could be difficult to explain the contrast between American troops in camouflage garb fighting in the desert and white-robed Kuwaitis sitting around hotel lobbies in Taif, Paris, London, Geneva, Monaco and Bahrain, sipping coffee and applauding the liberation of their homeland by others. American officials say only 3,000 of the 700,000 exiled Kuwaitis are among the troops on the front lines in the desert. 
 "I know, I know," said a senior Administration official traveling with Mr. Baker. "That's why if the war starts it has to go well for us from the very start, and by well I mean it has to be over fast. We will have to show discernible progress every day. Otherwise . . ."
Secretary Baker, when asked about the contrast, began by saying how moved he was by the four Kuwaitis he met in Taif who had been tortured by Iraqis. Then, however, he quickly added: "It's important to realize that our forces are there for a number of reasons. We've talked about the importance to Americans -- the average, everyday American -- in terms of what will happen to his pocketbook, to his standard of living, to his life style, if a dictator succeeds in putting himself astride the economic lifeline of the industrial world."
 
Too Many Reasons to Fight?
 Mr. Baker's answer only seemed to underscore a problem that has bedeviled the Administration's gulf policy from the start -- the difficulty of explaining quickly and simply what Americans are being asked to fight for. While Mr. Baker's answer suggested that a main reason was economic, he touched a different theme in addressing the troops earlier last week. Then, all he said was that they were fighting for "American values," particularly the principle that aggression should not be allowed to pay. And President Bush himself, at different times, has advanced a number of reasons for the American commitment: to defend Saudi Arabia, to defeat a dangerous dictator, to preserve economic stability and to preserve "our way of life." While on the campaign trail the President ruled out oil as a reason, but at the news conference on Thursday at which he announced an expanded buildup with an ability for attack, he acknowledged that "oil is part of it, but it is not a main reason -- a main reason we are there is to see that aggression is unrewarded."
These explanations have several fundamental weaknesses that some officials acknowledge are a source of worry. To begin with, many of these explanations are disconnected from the immediate concerns and lives of Americans; much as the troops in the desert seem out of their element, many of these explanations seem somehow artificial and out of context. A visitor to the troops is struck by how utterly alone the troops appear. When Mr. Baker went by helicopter to visit the First Cavalry Division, he flew for an hour over nothing but empty sand, and at the base camp all that could be seen in any direction was sand, sand and more sand. When reporters asked a handful of First Cavalry soldiers what their mission was, each gave a different answer -- protect oil, protect Saudi Arabia, defeat Saddam Hussein, smash Iraq, free Kuwait. There was no single gut reason -- no "Remember Pearl Harbor" -- that all intuitively grasped, identified with and could rearticulate. When they said, "We have a job to do," it seemed that they were motivated more by a sense of professional duty than a heartfelt commitment.
In fact, the United States has not made it a practice to go to war -- particularly on this scale -- just to uphold the principle that aggression never pays. When Vietnam invaded Cambodia and when Turkey invaded Cyprus, the United States did not commit troops, because no larger interests were at stake. Even in World War II, America did not become engaged until people who shared democratic values -- the French and British in particular -- had fallen or were in mortal danger.
In the gulf, President Bush cannot argue that the United States is protecting other democracies, because Kuwait and Saudi Arabia are feudal societies. The other larger interest -- oil -- is one the President is reluctant to articulate, officials say, because many people would find the use of American troops to fight over resources mercenary. Thus, the Bush Administration falls back on the admired, but somewhat abstract, principle that aggression must never be allowed to pay.
When Mr. Baker used the argument about aggression, the troops all seemed to nod in agreement and applaud. But when he was done, the soldiers still had a variety of explanations to offer, rather than a simple and compelling message that they had clearly taken to heart.
The second difficulty with the Administrationi's arguments is that Mr. Bush has made the restoration of the Kuwaiti ruling family an important goal -- not because he is enamored of them, but because their return would be the proof that aggression brought Mr. Hussein nothing. If the al-Sabahs go home, Mr. Bush wins; if not, Mr. Hussein wins, at least something.
That means, though, American officials acknowledge in private, that the symbol for the triumph of American principles is the restoration of feudal rulers who don't share democratic values.
As long as there is no shooting, and American troops are just defending Saudi Arabia and suffering sunburns, these questions and contradictions can be expected to remain largely in the back of people's minds. But if Americans shed their blood to evict Iraqis from Kuwait, and if the fighting is protracted, that could quickly change.

HEADLINE: The Nation: Measuring the Pain;
Why It's Too Soon To Predict Another Great Depression

BYLINE: By LEONARD SILK

 BODY:
ONE big reason for the angry mood of many voters last week was pain in the pocketbook, actual or expected, from sinking incomes, lost jobs, failing businesses, higher fuel prices and rising taxes. Even more disturbing than the perceived pain was a gnawing anxiety that the American economy might be headed not just for another brief recession, the 10th of the post-World War II period, but for a real depression.
Despite the headaches that are the hangover of the wild excesses of the 1980's, the United States economy has not yet cracked, nor is it inevitable that it will. But those who believe that anxiety is warranted say the nation's weakened financial structure might buckle if the economy goes into steep decline. James J. O'Leary, economic consultant to the United States Trust Company of New York, ticks off some major areas of stress: 
 As corporate profits decline, heavy interest payments on outstanding debt are increasing the risk, or reality, of business failures and creating rising losses for lending institutions. Cost-cutting and layoffs are the order of the day. Productivity is picking up, but the job losses and falling incomes are chopping into sales.
* Many commercial banks and life insurance companies are experiencing high and rising delinquency and foreclosure rates, and losses on their mortgage and business loans. Declining real estate prices in some areas are increasing the losses.
* The junk bonds issued during the go-go years, now gone, are raising grave problems for the corporations that used them to finance mergers and acquisitions, and for the people and institutions that acquired the bonds.
* Belatedly reacting to the savings and loan debacle, the Federal Reserve, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Comptroller of the Currency are tightening credit standards, especially on commercial mortgage loans. Banks and life insurance companies are far less willing to make such loans, except on terms that better reflect the risks. Bond rating agencies are lowering the ratings of some commercial banks and insurance companies, making it costlier for them to borrow. The slowing economy and the falling dollar, now at its lowest level ever against the German mark and Swiss franc, are stanching the flow of foreign capital to the United States. An enormous credit crunch looms.
If that were the whole story, one could title it "The Great Depression of the 1990's" and send it to press. But it is not. Even if fullscale war were to break out in the Persian Gulf, it seems unlikely that it would become the kind of protracted and ruinous event that would inflict lasting damage to the American or world economy.
As Adam Smith wrote in 1776, "There is a lot of ruin in a nation," and the country has learned a lot since 1776, and particularly since 1929-1933, about how to prevent economic collapse.
Most important is the lesson that the fiscal and monetary powers of the Federal Government and the Federal Reserve System can be used to maintain the overall level of national income and prevent even the most severe financial shock from bringing the economy down.
Black Monday in October 1987, when the Dow Jones industrial average fell over 500 points, demonstrated the point. After the New York stock market crashed, and closely linked foreign markets crashed as well, the Federal Reserve and foreign central banks made sure that enough money was available for banks to take care of their customers. So businesses kept borrowing and investing, consumers kept borrowing and spending, and the economy continued to expand.
In the United States, the gross national product, the total output of goods and services, continued to rise through 1988, 1989 and well into 1990, though at a slower rate. It was still expanding in the third quarter of 1990.
Nevertheless, many economists and noneconomists alike think that the longest peacetime expansion, dating back to November 1982, is finally over. The consensus view of the Blue Chip Economic Indicators survey of 55 leading economists for November is that real G.N.P. will decline at annual rates of 0.8 percent in the current quarter and 0.6 percent in the first quarter of next year. Two negative-growth quarters in a row would, by a common definition, make for a recession. Three-fourths of the economists surveyed expect the recession to last only two or three quarters, and an even larger majority -- 82 percent -- expect it to be relatively mild.
Are the economists, most of whom switched to their "mild" recession forecast only after Iraq invaded Kuwait and oil prices shot up, still too blithe? Many noneconomists think the situation is worse than the economists are saying. A psychotherapist asks if she shouldn't put all her dollars into Swiss francs, so the family doesn't lose all its money as her father did in prewar Germany. A journalist and his wife decide to scale back and delay the renovation of the second floor of their house. A political pollster says the economy will be the big issue in 1992.
Economists define the "misery index" as the sum of the unemployment and inflation rates. Unemployment held at 5.7 percent last month, but was up from a low of 5.2 percent last March, and the inflation rate, measured by the consumer price index, is running at 5.5 percent over last year. Objectively, the country has seen much worse. But misery is a subjective thing, and the classic popular definition is, "A recession is when you are out of work, and a depression is when I am out ofwork." The mind has its reasons, but so has the stomach.
Business people register a great depression when their own businesses fail, and the failure rate is up sharply this year. Dun & Bradstreet reports that in the first nine months of 1990 business failures increased 14.5 percent over 1989.
The failure story varied greatly, however, in different parts of the country. In New England, deep in its own recession, the number of business failures leaped by 192.8 percent. In the Middle Atlantic States, also hard hit, failures were up by 64.6 percent in the first nine months of this year. But on the Pacific Coast, business failures were down 3.5 percent, and in the East North Central states, which include Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Michigan and Wisconsin, they were down 8.5 percent. Some could still argue that the United States economy was experiencing what once was called a rolling readjustment, with some regions and industries down while others were still up, and each area taking its turn sequentially. By this reckoning, the Southwest and Midwest have largely taken their lumps, while the Northeast and Middle Atlantic States are in the midst of their agony.
These shifts also reflect differences by industry. The liabilities of failures in finance, insurance and real estate totaled $28.3 billion in the first nine months of this year, while failures in manufacturing were $4.1 billion and in mining just $287.5 million. The intensity of the current depression psychology may be subjectively affected by the fact that hard-hit New York is the financial and media capital of the nation, with Wall Street having laid off more than 75,000 employees since the crash, advertising off sharply, and The Daily News in the midst of a bruising strike.
Whether the country is on the verge of a depression is, however, another question. The answer will depend on national and international monetary, fiscal and trade policies. And right now the answer looks relatively reassuring. There is every reason to expect that, with the budget battle over and worries about recession rising, the Federal Reserve will ease money and keep nudging interest rates down, which should help housing, autos and other durable goods, and help brace falling consumer confidence. The Fed will need the cooperation of the other major central banks, especially the German Bundesbank and the Bank of Japan, if it is to follow this course without driving the dollar down too fast and far.
The cheapening of the dollar against the mark, the yen and other currencies should help strengthen United States exports and help offset any further decline in domestic production. It would help greatly if America's partners in Europe and Asia keep expanding and open their markets more widely to American manufactured goods, farm products, intellectual property and services. A successful outcome of the Uruguay Round of trade negotiations under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, which are expected to conclude before the end of the year, would do a lot to ward off the threat of recession or depression.
The threat will also likely be parried by falling oil prices, as a result of Saudi Arabia's decision to increase its oil production sharply, with output having already risen to 8.2 million barrels a day and scheduled to rise to 8.5 million barrels a day early next year. Further, the price should be pushed down by overall levels of supply and the declining world demand for oil. Of course, war in the gulf would wreck that hopeful expectation. Last Wednesday, hawkish comments by Margaret Thatcher, the British Prime Minister, were enough to send oil prices shooting up $2.68 a barrel, the sharpest gain in two weeks. But if war is avoided, a reversal of oil-price inflation promises to strengthen business and consumer spending on other goods and services. Even at recent oil prices, business investment and consumer spending have held up remarkably well. The danger of a heavy wave of inventory cutting by American industry is not large; business has been holding inventories tight to conserve cash and keep down costs. The stability of the economy in the third quarter reflected this determination of industry to stay lean, mean and competitive.
The most serious problem hanging over the United States economy remains the huge debt burden. Total debt outstanding has reached $12.5 trillion, compared with just $2 trillion a decade and a half ago. If the American economy keeps growing, that enormous debt, four-fifths of it private and the rest public, can be handled. The grave danger of a steep recession is that it could create a huge wave of defaults that would threaten to wreck the financial structure.
This is why the nation's money managers hope to sustain the slow expansion, if that is still possible -- or, if it is too late, to keep the recession brief and mild, while laying the groundwork for a stable recovery. A rise by any other name would smell as sweet.

HEADLINE: In McCarthy Era, TV Networks Cowered;
'The White Case'

 BODY:
To the Editor:
In "Warmed-Over Smear" (column, Oct. 29) Anthony Lewis calls attention to the accusations made more than 40 years ago against Harry Dexter White, once a Treasury official. The "White case," it seems, has once again been given sensationalized publicity in Time magazine.
Thoughtful observers have long come to regard the so-called McCarthy era as a shameful period in our nation's past. They know that during the late 1940's and for more than a decade after, the reputations and often the lives of thousands of innocent citizens were ruined by irresponsible accusations of disloyalty.
Harry White was an early victim of McCarthyism. If Americans recognize the name at all, they probably have heard only the accusations that he was a highly placed spy and a traitor to his country.
We think it pertinent to remind readers of the following:
* Despite years of close surveillance by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, which included shadowing and wiretaps, the evidence produced against White never consisted of anything more than the unsubstantiated allegations of two F.B.I. informers unknown to the accused (including Time magazine's own Whittaker Chambers).
* As Mr. Lewis remarks, the members of a grand jury who examined this evidence found it so flimsy that they failed even to bring an indictment against White.
* Just three days before his untimely death -- a direct consequence of his persecution -- the ailing White appeared before the House Committee on Un-American Activities at his own request to clear his name. There, on Aug. 13, 1948, he vigorously denied the charges against him. He defended himself as ably as was possible for a man forced into attempting to prove a negative and denied even the elementary right to confront his accusers. Anyone interested in learning what sort of man Harry Dexter White was need only read the statement of his creed in the transcript of his testimony that day.
It is pertinent to recall White's outstanding contributions as Assistant Secretary of the Treasury and as author of the original plans for the International Monetary Fund and the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (the World Bank). As a distinguished civil servant and a brilliant economist, Harry White served his country well.
We reaffirm that we are proud to be his daughters.

HEADLINE: The Region;
Worse Than Cuts And Layoffs? More Taxes

BYLINE: By TODD S. PURDUM

 BODY:
MAYOR DAVID N. DINKINS warned that he had "some bad news and some worse news" last week as he outlined the cutbacks needed in New York City's budget to keep it balanced this year and next. He said it was too early even to talk about what new taxes might be required.
Yet those taxes could be the worst news of all in a stagnant economy and in the wake of last week's elections, which saw the defeat of a $2 billion environmental bond act in New York State and the near defeat of Senator Bill Bradley in New Jersey, in a backlash over Gov. Jim Florio's aggressive tax policies there. 
 To close a gap of $388 million between expected revenues and expenses in the current budget, Mr. Dinkins announced immediate cutbacks in services, from parks to schools, and the layoff of more than 500 workers. But he said far deeper cuts, and perhaps thousands of layoffs, would be needed to close a gap of at least $1.6 billion in the fiscal year starting July 1.
The state's problems may be even deeper, with a probable budget gap for this year of at least $900 million, and another of between $2 billion and $3 billion for next year. In the last two years, City Hall and Albany have already raised taxes by more than $3 billion, so the choices for the future are tough.
"I think that anyone who doesn't view the election results and understand that voters were sending a clear message is living in Never-Never Land and doesn't understand reality," said Herbert E. Berman, chairman of the New York City Council's finance committee. "The region is in a recession, and the worst thing for local businesses now would be an increase in taxes."
Mr. Berman, Council Speaker Peter F. Vallone and other city officials do not rule out some tax increases, especially if they are reserved for financing specific needs, like law enforcement. But they stress that the easy options have already been used up.
 
'The Last Resort'
 "We've picked all the low-hanging fruit already," said Carol O'Cleireacain, the city's Finance Commissioner. "If we're going to start going after more taxes, then we've got to sit down in coordination and say which is more reasonable for us to go after at the state level, which at the local level and so forth.
"I think it's safe to say that the tax component of any gap-closing will be the absolutely last resort," Ms. O'Cleireacain said.
Before the election, some city officials and fiscal experts had said there was probably room for one more round of substantial state and city tax increases next spring. Privately, city officials now say they could not conceive of their own tax proposals exceeding a few hundred million dollars, which would come on top of a record $800 million increase this year.
The tax that experts most often point to as ripe for increase is the property tax on one- , two- and three-family homes. Historically, this class of taxpayers has been shielded, while commercial property taxes rose faster. The City Council alone has the power to raise property taxes, one of the very few categories over which it has sole control.
But raising these taxes next year would be particularly problematic, because the Council districts are to be redrawn under the new City Charter, and in a special election all 35 seats will be up for grabs and 16 new seats will be added, not only threatening incumbents but reshaping the entire local political order.
"That's clearly an issue," Mr. Berman said. "The political process is there."
Yet there appears to be some public support for higher taxes. A telephone poll of 766 city residents conducted before the election by the Marist Institute of Public Opinion found that 54 percent supported raising taxes to balance the budget, compared to 25 percent who favored cutting services. For the same purpose, 61 percent favored higher taxes, compared to 23 percent who favored layoffs.
If the taxes were for specific needs, the support was greater, with 62 percent agreeing that an increase in property taxes was a good way to finance Mr. Dinkins's proposal to hire thousands of additional police officers and expand the criminal justice system.
The poll also found that 76 percent of New Yorkers supported Mr. Dinkins's call for a payroll tax to help finance the same program, while 83 percent favored his proposal for a 25-cent surcharge on lottery tickets. The poll had a sampling error of plus or minus 4 percentage points.
 
 'Difficult Balancing Act'
 "Public opinion seems to suggest," Lee M. Miringoff, director of the Marist Institute, "that there is an understanding -- not an eagerness, but an understanding -- that when taxes are earmarked for specific purposes, that might be a way to go."
Yet the tax proposals for the anti-crime plan either face tough sledding or are considered dead in Albany and the City Council. And many fiscal experts, business people and even some advocacy groups oppose dedicated taxes, on the grounds that once a tax is reserved for a certain need, advocates of other needs will press for special taxes too, thus weakening the general ability of government to gather resources and spend them as needed.
"When you're the highest tax jurisdiction in the United States, raising taxes is always a gamble," said Ronald K. Shelp, president of the New York City Partnership and the New York Chamber of Commerce and Industry, which last year gave state leaders a list of taxes it said could be raised.
But, he added, given the recent record increases, "and when you're in an economic slowdown and you have other jurisdictions around the country courting your businesses, raising taxes is not just a gamble, it's betting against yourself."
On the other hand, Mr. Shelp said, businesses, like everyone else, also care "about housing, public education, quality of life and the rest -- you've got a difficult balancing act."

HEADLINE: Enduring, Not Always Endearing 'Wall Street Week'

BYLINE: By N. R. KLEINFIELD

DATELINE: OWINGS MILLS, Md.

 BODY:
"NOW Lou should walk into the studio in 5 or 10 minutes," announced the technician. "As soon as Lou walks in, please stay in your seat and keep quiet. Try to keep all your laughter to yourself if he says something funny. And no eating or smoking."
The faces of the small audience lifted in attention and, sure enough, in 10 minutes Louis Rukeyser loped in. He gave a winsome smile and got himself into position. Some last-minute makeup was patted on his nose.
"Do we have liftoff?" Mr. Rukeyser asked.
"Let's go," someone said. 
 And so it was once again time to tape "Wall Street Week," that animated, occasionally impertinent Friday-evening dissection of the economic landscape. As always, the improbable setting was the studios of Maryland Public Television in the town of Owings Mills, outside Baltimore.
The program, which celebrates its 20th anniversary on Friday with a festive episode at Tavern on the Green in Manhattan, has been one of the most popular and robust public affairs shows on national television, and it has done a lot to spawn other business programming. Along with success, however, has come a fair amount of vitriol. Any number of viewers and guests find the program irksome and complain of its game-show feel and question its stock-picking wisdom.
With public television audiences lately migrating to other television choices, the show's popularity has shrunk, though not as much as many other public TV offerings. "Wall Street Week" is carried by 318 stations (including Channel 13 in the New York area), but its ratings the last two years have settled at their lowest point in a decade. According to the Public Broadcasting Service, the show averaged a 2.8 rating (which equates to about 2.6 million homes) the last two seasons, after rising as high as 4.3 in the 1982-83 season.
Besides the anniversary program, a one-hour special will be broadcast on Nov. 19 crammed with clips from the 20 years: the time when a hunter shot out the video feed and viewers saw no picture; when Milton Friedman was asked what he would replace the Federal Reserve with and he said, "A computer," and when a guest named Adriaan Schrikker, asked if he had any stock tips, dug out a slip of paper and rattled off 66 names, in alphabetical order.
SINCE the program's inception -- the idea came from the offhand suggestion of a Baltimore broker -- the host has been Mr. Rukeyser, a former newspaperman and network newscaster who was the first economics commentator at ABC. A large-framed, dapper man of 57 with wavy white hair and an impish grin, he is probably best known for his wisecracks and his incurable addiction to egregiously bad puns. (He once told a gas-and-electric analyst he would now turn him over to his utility infielders.)
The half-hour show is split into several segments: some remarks by Mr. Rukeyser, market chatter with three panelists, questions from viewers and finally an interview with a special guest.
For his work, Mr. Rukeyser earns about $300,000 a year, which is significant money but a fraction of what he pockets on the lecture circuit. He delivers about 40 speeches a year on the economy at $25,000 a talk, and fills up idle time writing books and a newspaper column. There has been a certain amount of financial journalism in his blood, for his father, Merryle, was an economics columnist, and one brother, William, had been managing editor of Fortune and now is editor in chief at Whittle Communications.
During its protracted run, "Wall Street Week" has made stars out of any number of guests and panelists previously well known only to their immediate family and their dentists. Monte Gordon, the director of research at the Dreyfus Corporation and a panelist since 1982, says, "I get recognized in bus lines. I get recognized when I'm eating in restaurants. There's a lot of psychic satisfaction to being on the show."
Some on Wall Street regularly pester their publicity agents to mount an assault on Rich Dubroff, the producer who picks guests. One hopeful broker once offered to send Mr. Dubroff a supply of his favorite liquor to help the process along. Mr. Dubroff reported the broker to his branch manager.
Len Kessler, a publicist for Lee Laino Associates, figures that a mutual fund manager who appears on the program could reap millions of dollars in new business. So how badly do people want to get on? "It's spelled k-i-l-l," Mr. Kessler says. One publicist says that he was offered $25,000 by a client if he got him on the show and knows of a colleague who was dangled $50,000. Neither got on.
But the program is by no means universally adored. " 'Wall Street Week' is too oiled," says Louis Ehrenkrantz, the research coordinator of Ladenburg Thalmann. "It's too reminiscent of a game show. It's even got it's own Vanna White. It's also got too much of the unction of the old French court."
Robert Nurock was a panelist on the first show and eventually designed the program's Technical Market Index, a stock market indicator. He freely admits his fame from the program enabled him to start his own investment advisory firm, Investors Analysis Inc., in Paoli, Pa. But after 19 years of appearances, Mr. Nurock quit in October 1989, contending that his views were being muffled.
"The show has become more show business than anything else," Mr. Nurock says. "I think it has lost a lot of its appeal to anyone who is interested in anything other than entertainment. It has become more mainstream and representative of the Wall Street establishment. It doesn't provide much insight to investors beyond the obvious."
For his part, Mr. Rukeyser feels that Mr. Nurock's forecasts had been off target in recent times and he grew embittered.
Though many guests have great fun, appearing on the program is not always an experience you would like your mother to see. Some individuals wobble out of the studio feeling as if they had been caught in a cement mixer. Letters to the program make it clear that many viewers own no stocks but tune in for what can seem like a financial version of professional wrestling.
FOR instance, Robert Prechter, editor of the Elliott Wave Theorist, a monthly market newsletter, has been on several times and, during his last appearance in 1988, got put in some pretty painful holds. "He came on lying," Mr. Rukeyser says. "He just denied the things he had said. And we had to point it out. He misunderstood and thought the program was for his own glorification."
"That's just the typical Rukeyser pathology," Mr. Prechter shoots back. "He would rather use the big lie story than admit a mistake. Rukeyser keeps claiming he represents the little guy and he's right. But the little guy is himself."
It isn't at all necessary to appear on the show to get a little mutilated. Earlier this year, P. Q. Wall, a Denver newsletter writer, was the subject of a profile in Barron's. The article mentioned that Mr. Wall had once written that Mr. Rukeyser resembled a "wax museum caricature of George Washington." That Friday, Mr. Rukeyser began his show ridiculing Mr. Wall and adding him to the list of "discredited gloomy gurus." Mr. Wall thinks the trigger was the wax museum analogy. But he's not too mad. "I'm basically an Irish Santa Claus," he says. "But I don't think Rukeyser gets too deeply into the cycles of the financial markets."
Of guests resentful of their treatment, Mr. Rukeyser responds: "My job is to be there for the viewer, not to massage the ego of some fat cat guest. The ones who are sensitive are the guys who say they called the last 42 turns in the market and who think they're the Lord incarnate."
Whatever emotions it incites, the show has been proficient at attracting money for itself. More than half of its annual budget of nearly $2 million is met by grants from Prudential-Bache, Travelers and the Enron Corporation. The rest flows from fees paid by stations for broadcast rights. Much of those fees are in turn underwritten by brokerage firms and banks.
It was late now, the night's taping finished, and Mr. Rukeyser and Mr. Dubroff repaired to a conference room with several others to watch a videotape of the show. Mr. Rukeyser nibbled on raw carrots and clutched a stopwatch to time each segment.
Mr. Rukeyser grumbled that a panelist took a whole minute to answer a question, and then watched, with growing mirth, the interview with special guest Richard H. Jenrette, the chairman of the Equitable Life Assurance Society. During the interview, Mr. Rukeyser repeatedly pointed out that Equitable seemed to be riddled with problems, while Mr. Jenrette essentially insisted that the world couldn't be more wonderful.
WATCHING Mr. Jenrette reply to a question about recent bad publicity -- "I would say the stories are greatly overblown" -- Mr. Rukeyser couldn't refrain from sniggering.
When Mr. Jenrette remarked, in dead seriousness, "Everybody has a bad year now and then," Mr. Rukeyser broke out in laughter.
On the tape, Mr. Rukeyser asked when things would improve for Equitable. Mr. Jenrette said, "Let's come back in a year and I'll give you a good report."
"Yeah, right!" Mr. Dubroff said.
"Would you buy a used GIC from this man?" Mr. Rukeyser said, referring to a popular insurance industry product known as a guaranteed investment contract.
"After looking at his company, division by division," Mr. Dubroff said, "I wouldn't buy anything from this man."
The room filled with laughter.
(In subsequent discussion, Mr. Jenrette was not joyous. "If you go on a show, you have to expect tough questions," he said, "but I felt there was unfair characterization of the company's overall position.")
After tending to assorted matters, Mr. Rukeyser left the studio at 10:30 for a late dinner. Over wine and lobster, he said he was still a long-term optimist on the stock market and that his aim was "to educate people to get rich slow."
He said he would keep doing the show as long as the audience wants him to and as long as it's fun. Time, perhaps, for Mr. Jenrette to make many additional appearances.
 
 
CAVEAT INVESTOR
 QUITE a few viewers see "Wall Street Week" as a way to get rich, or at least a little more comfortable. There has long been evidence of a pickup in trading volume of stocks mentioned on the program on the Monday following its airing. For some years, however, the actual wisdom of the stock recommendations has invited sharp differences of opinion.
Several studies have been done of the performance of stocks mentioned on the show, the most famous by Norman Fosback, the editor of Market Logic, a newsletter. In studies he did in the mid-1980's, he concluded that buying activity on the Monday after a show caused recommended stocks to advance an average of some 2 percent. Within a few months, however, he found that the prices settled back to their old levels.
(Some years ago, Barron's suggested that the best way to profit from the show would be to find out who upcoming guests are, read what they've been promoting in their research reports and then buy some of those stocks before the program.)
Louis Rukeyser, the program's host, dismisses Mr. Fosback's studies as "full of baloney," and insists that Mr. Fosback is miffed because he had never been invited to be on the show.
"He's totally off the wall," Mr. Fosback replies.
Mr. Rukeyser is adamant about pointing out that no one should trade stocks solely based on "Wall Street Week." "Anyone who is looking for a tip on a hot flier is in the wrong pew," he said. "You should use the name as a suggestion to do some homework."

HEADLINE: Judge Harold Stevens, 83, Dies; First Black on Court of Appeals

BYLINE: By MIREYA NAVARRO

 BODY:
Harold A. Stevens, the first black to sit on New York State's highest court and a former State Assemblyman, died on Friday at his home in Harlem. He was 83 years old.
Justice Stevens died of a heart attack and was pronounced dead at Harlem Hospital, said a friend and fellow jurist, Justice E. Leo Milonas. 
 Justice Stevens represented the 13th Assembly District in Albany from 1947 to 1950. He resigned from the Assembly after his election to the Court of General Sessions, his first judicial position.
In 1955, he was appointed Justice of the State Supreme Court by Gov. W. Averell Harriman. He was subsequently elected for a 14-year term.
 
First Black in Judicial Posts
 In 1958, he was named Associate Justice of the Appellate Division of the New York Supreme Court. In 1969, he was appointed Presiding Justice of the Appellate Division's First Department, where he helped supervise a reorganization of the court system and was the guiding force behind a program to build new courthouses.
He was named to the highest court, the State Court of Appeals, in 1974 as an interim appointment. The next year he was redesignated Presiding Justice of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court. He retired in 1977.
He was the first black to hold each of these positions.
As a judge, Justice Stevens created "sentencing panels" to review cases to avoid sentencing disparities that often reflected differences in race and economic status. He also directed a procedure to mediate medical malpractice cases and ease court crowding.
 
'No Voice of Protest'
 Harold Arnoldus Stevens was born in 1907 on a 1,000-acre farm owned by his father on John's Island, S.C. Justice Stevens graduated from Benedict College in Columbia, S.C. and obtained his law degreee from Boston College in 1936. In a 1958 interview, he said he had decided to become a lawyer after a 1926 incident in which a black woman and her two brothers, accused of killing a sheriff, were dragged from the county jail in Aiken, S.C., towed through town behind a car, shot and mutilated.
"There was no voice of protest raised," he said. "Then I was inspired to study law because it was our best bet to eliminate things like this."
A convert to Roman Catholicism, he received the Papal Pro Ecclesia et Pontifice medal in 1954 from Pope Pius XII for his interracial work.
He also served as special counsel to President Roosevelt's Committee on Fair Employment Practices, and was credited with forcing a hearing on efforts by Southern railroads and white engineers to oust black firefighters from their long-held jobs.
A World War II veteran, he received many awards and honorary law degrees, including one from the University of South Carolina in 1988. The school expelled his grandfather in the 1890's after a segregationist Governor, Wade Hampton, decided that no black would graduate from college in his state, said Justice Milonas.
Justice Stevens is survived by his wife, the former Ella C. Myers; a brother, John Stevens of New York City, and several nieces and nephews.

HEADLINE: Businesses Confront Office Wastepaper

BYLINE: By PENNY SINGER

DATELINE: ARDSLEY

 BODY:
THE same week McDonald's announced it would do away with its plastic foam hamburger box because "our customers just don't feel good about it," a broad spectrum of county businesses sent 70 representatives to a conference here to learn about protecting the planet by improving the disposal of office waste.
The Ciba-Geigy Corporation, which collects an average of 10 tons of recyclable material each month in the county, was the host for the seminar, sponsored by the Westchester County Association, the county government and Inform, a nonprofit environmental-research group based in Manhattan.
A series of speakers from industry and government outlined what they perceived as a growing crisis and then spoke about the role businesses played in generating waste and in disposing of it.
 
The Waste Stream Is Growing
 "It is a crisis," emphasized Constantine Sidamon-Eristoff, administrator of Region 2 of the Federal Environmental Protection Agency, an area that includes Westchester. "Since 1960, the waste stream has been growing faster than the population."
Nationally, he said, "we're generating 160 million tons of garbage a year and nearly a third of the country's 6,500 landfills are expected to close within two years."
So any effective strategy for managing waste, he concluded, must rely heavily on reducing waste and recycling it.
S. J. Schulman, president of the Westchester County Association, a business group, urged companies to take the lead in recycling efforts and suggested why: "One-third of the waste in Westchester is generated by business. If recycling fails, it means that more money will have to be spent on building a capital facility to handle it" like another garbage-to-energy incinerator.
 
Handling Government Paper
 The county built the incinerator in Peekskill that now handles much of the 371,00 tons of waste generated in Westchester a year. But it does not now have the money for a similar effort, said County Executive Andrew P. O'Rourke. "The 1991 budget is edged in black," he said. "We have to conserve what we have. Therefore, getting business involved in recycling becomes doubly important."
The county became committed to recycling two years ago, Mr. O'Rourke said. "Nothing produces paper like government and that is why legislation requiring government to use recycled paper is especially important," he said. "It helps create a market for recycled products."
Every month, 682 tons of paper from 185 companies in the New York City region are being recovered, according to the State Legislative Commission on Solid Waste. The efforts of businesses and government in Westchester set a good example for the country, said Joanna D. Underwood, president and founder of Inform.
"Recycling is a basic way of making businesses more efficient," Ms. Underwood said. "It is a process that doesn't call for any new technology. Only simple mundane steps are required, such as collecting waste and finding buyers and carters for materials."
One Westchester example cited at the conference was the Reader's Digest in Chappaqua, which has announced that it saved $100,000 a year in disposal costs because of its waste program.
"New industries, which use recycled materials to make their products, are then created," said Ms. Underwood, who added that the recycling of waste products is itself now an industry, and one that has provided jobs for semi-skilled people and handicapped workers.
 
Waste Law Going into Effect
 But aside from any potential economic incentives, waste management will become the law of the land, said Janet L. Matthews, legislative director of the New York State Legislative Commission on Solid Waste.
"Waste reduction is a priority of New York State," she said. "By 1992, separation of waste materials" -- plastics, glass, cardboard and paper -- "is mandated. Our goal is to increase recyclable materials by 40 percent and reduce waste by 10 percent."
State grants and loans are available for recycling programs, Ms. Matthews said, adding that the state is depending on the private sector to use secondary materials and recover materials from waste.
National goals, Mr. Sidamon-Eristoff of the E.P.A. said, call for a 25 percent reduction in the waste stream by 1992. This would be achieved by reduction and recycling, reversing the trend of increased waste production; by improving solid-waste management practices and by the development of needed landfills, municipal waste combusters and secondary markets to handle waste.
The conference's host, Ciba-Geigy, takes an "aggressive approach" to reducing the production of waste at its manufacturing plants, research laboratories and office buildings, said Richard Barth, Ciba-Geigy's president and chief operating officer.
"So far this year in the county, we have averaged 10 tons of recyclable materials a month," he said, "helped by the active participation of our employees, who have made recycling a natural part of their daily routine."
 
Employee Understanding Is a Key
 Thomas Bianchi, manager of engineering and maintenance, shared some nuts and bolts details of the Ciba-Geigy program with the seminar participants. What's needed, he said, is manpower, space, a budget and knowledge of the recycled materials market.
Mr. Bianchi said his company had carved out space for recycling stations throughout its 60-acre site here. "They're used mostly for paper and glassware collected from labs," he said. "For the first eight months of the year, we've collected 80 tons of paper, which is the equivalent of 400 trees, or 200 barrels of oil, which would heat 20 houses in New York State for a year."
Up-front costs include the labor of the 13 people needed for the recycling program. "We've realized $1,200, paid to us for recycled items," Mr. Bianchi said. "But the real results are down the road in the form of a sharp drop in disposal costs."
<> <> But the sharp drop in disposal costs is linked to finding markets for the recycled material, and that can be a problem, said James J. Hogan, director of resource management for the County Department of Public Works.
"What recycling actually means is selling recycled material to 'end users' who will make something of it," Mr. Hogan said. "But the problem is, the end user isn't always sure of a reliable supply of material. A mandatory recycling program is needed to insure the end user that he'll have his materials."
The county, Mr. Hogan said, is stimulating the markets for recycled materials by buying recycled products and by helping end users, like a company that is processing mixed plastic materials. "We're helping them find a site for their plant," he said.
The County Recycling Office has set up a hot line -- 285-2588 -- for businesses seeking recycling information.
Carl LaCavalla, vice president of Suburban Carting in Mamaroneck, a commercial transporting company, said carters have become solid-waste consultants and have begun to form recycling companies because "it's adapt or die."
"But recycling will cost business money," Mr. LaCavalla said, because the marketing structure "is not there."
Most wastepaper, which is the largest recycled item, is going overseas to Pacific Rim countries, he said. "The only way it can get used up here is to create a market. Wastepaper used to bring $40 a ton; now we have to pay $40 a ton to get rid of it."
He criticized the county, saying it had no good solid-waste management program in place. "We know garbage," he said. "We know small and large businesses must be part of the waste-management plan. Right now, it's a gloomy picture."
But to help them become part of the solution, the conference's participants each received a Business Recycling Manual. The manual, commissioned by the Westchester County Association, prepared by Inform and produced by Recourse Systems of Cambridge, Mass, delves into such topics as designing waste-management programs, teaching employees, negotiating with carters and dealing with special materials. To obtain a copy call 285-2532.

HEADLINE: LONG ISLAND Q&A: HAROLD E. ADAMS;
A 30-Year Veteran in the Many Efforts to Combat Drugs

BYLINE: By PHILLIP LUTZ

 BODY:
AFTER more than 30 years in the drug wars, Harold E. Adams, Commissioner of the Nassau County Department of Drug and Alcohol Addiction, says the efforts are largely imagery.
Mr. Adams, the only commissioner since the department was created in 1972, says addiction is as widespread and community resistance to treatment centers as pronounced today as when he began his career. Apathy toward and denial of the problems, he contends, are as prevalent as ever among some parents and school administrators.
Despite his strong support of anti-drug laws, Mr. Adams says that the long-term solution, if there is one, lies not in largely ineffective law-enforcement measures, but in emphasizing treatment and education.
Mr. Adams, 59 years old, began his career in 1958 as a parole officer, rising to supervisor. In 1969, he became a supervisor of after-care services for the state's old Narcotics Addiction Control Commission. In 1970, he became director of a mental-health clinic in the East New York section of Brooklyn.
A consultant to Federal and state agencies, Mr. Adams, in his $96,000-a-year position as Nassau Commissioner, supervises a $40 million budget that pays for 175 programs treating 25,000 people a year.
A native of Brooklyn, Mr. Adams lives with his wife in Roosevelt. They have one daughter, a doctor in Manhattan.
Q. How have the problems of chemical dependency evolved over the years, and what is the outlook for continued high levels of drug use?
A. It's cyclical. We've gone through a lot of different eras in this department. We've had the high incidence of heroin abuse, the LSD scares, PCP -- all types of periods where one drug or another seems to be most popular.
There's always a new drug. If you go through the history of this country -- starting with the Civil War veterans addicted to morphine and right through cocaine, marijuana and LSD -- there is always a different drug. The popular drug now, and the one creating so many problems, is cocaine and its derivative, crack.
Q. Is there any satisfactory way to treat crack addiction?
A. People are still learning, us included. One thing we've learned is that this population needs services very specifically developed to deal with that type of addiction. We find that residential treatment has to be more intensive, but on a shorter-term basis.
Q. Hasn't the typical course of treatment at Topic House, the county-run residential treatment center in Plainview, been relatively long term? Does this show a change in philosophy?
A. It does. Topic House has been basically a long-term facility where people have been in treatment for a year to 18 months, with 14 to 16 months a good average. We've been trying to revise that program to deal with the new addiction.
You have to understand that we still have only one residential treatment center in Nassau County, Topic House. It had a capacity of 75, and recently expanded to 88.
Just because we're dealing with the crack addiction there doesn't mean that heroin addiction has gone away. Heroin addiction is very much part of the scene. Crack is getting a lot of the publicity, but there has been an upsurge in heroin in recent months.
Q. Your department recieved $3 million from the Federal Government last year to expand outpatient, methadone maintenance, day treatment and residential services. You had been having some problem finding space for the residential beds, and the financing was to run out at the end of September. What happened?
A. We've been very successful in all the areas, with the exception of residential. We've asked that we be given more time for the residential phase and that the money originally awarded be diverted into day treatment, methadone and outpatient services, so that we wouldn't lose the money and, at the same time, would get an extension to develop additional residential treatment slots.
We've been meeting with the county administration on this, and we're hoping that we'll be able to increase our residential treatment capacity by the middle of next year.
In the interim, we've entered into a contract with a private organization called Mediplex, which runs short-term residential programs at two places near Albany and a third place in Pennsylvania that are pretty well suited to cocaine and crack addiction.
Individuals in need of short-term treatment come through our inpatient unit and are placed immediately into treatment at one of those facilities, with the idea that they'll be receiving clinical treatment.
Q. What are the prospects for being able to improve inpatient residential treatment?
A. That very issue is now under discussion with the county administration. Because of the "not in my backyard" syndrome, if we're really going to do something, the answer is going to have to be on either county- or state-owned property, where a facility can be converted, utilized or built.
We're exploring a plan possibly to do that on county property. That plan has not been fully developed yet. But we hope that by the middle of next year we will have a facility that will allow us to increase our residential capability by providing what I would call, for want of a better word, a halfway house for those individuals who come through Topic House, successfully complete the treatment phase and are being moved back into the community.
Q. Is there a specific site or building in mind?
A. No. Right now, the county is reviewing a couple of options. Originally, we had a Topic House at Mitchel Field in mind, but I don't think that's going to be a site location.
The decision has not been made as to what county properties might lend themselves to that.
Q. The Governor had been talking about a major expansion in the number of treatment beds. Is anything likely to come of that?
A. No. In my opinion, that's not going to happen any time in the near future because the state faces on a statewide basis the same problem we face locally. That is, where do you put these programs? The state is going to have to take the lead and make its facilities available for these programs.
Q. Your department provides individual counseling in a one-dormitory 60-bed treatment unit in the county jail. What are the prospects for expanding the number of people who are treated?
A. My department has the responsibility for providing services only to the D.W.I. population in the jail. The substance-abuse program is run by the jail itself. We work cooperatively with them, but we do not run the program.
Two things have happened that I think are significant. First, at the Sheriff's request, my department will be conducting intensive training programs for the jail staff that's going to be providing services.
Second, my department, working cooperatively with the jail, has submitted a propoal -- and early reaction has been favorable -- to the Federal Government for a $4.1 million grant for three components: One for the expansion of women's and children's services and two for services under the criminal-justice system.
The other criminal-justice component is probation. We're working very closely with the Probation Department in providing services for those individuals who are mandated into treatment by the courts.
Q. How useful is it to arrest users of drugs, considering that so many are being referred for treatment?
A. The law is the law, and people who violate it should be arrested, whether they're using drugs or breaking into houses. The law really is for possession and sales, although they go hand-in-hand with usage.
We are working with the County Court and Probation Department to develop programs for those caught up in drug sweeps. We feel we can develop a program that will see to it that those individuals who, after evaluation, are found not to present a problem, can be referred into the treatment network. Let's face it. The jails are overcrowded, and we have to look for alternatives for those individuals who don't pose a threat and are interested in trying to change.
Q. What do you think of the spending priorities among anti-drug agencies? Would it be better to spend more on treatment than on law enforcement?
A. My feeling is that the drug war, or wars -- and I've been a part of just about every one -- are mostly imagery or public relations. The one we have currently is a good example.
The so-called war on drugs, whose centerpiece was going to be Washington, has shown no significant changes a year later. The priorities have to be looked at and changed.
The prevention and education initiative has been greatly underfinanced over the years, not only on the Federal level, but on the state level as well. The reason for this is that it is very difficult to graphically illustrate that prevention and education work.
It takes time to work with kids and, hopefully, have an effect on their lives. But it's not dramatic -- not like having a big drug bust in which everyone gets his picture taken with great quantities of heroin or cocaine there. That appeases the public, but it does not really do anything in terms of eradicating the problem.
Q. How do you react to the questioning of the value of drug education by William Bennett, the President's Director of Drug Control Policy?
A. I find that very interesting in coming from the former Secretary of Education. The public has been misled. The current Administration's drug war has not really succeeded, and I think that part of the problem has been that there has been a lot of emphasis on the law-enforcement part of it and not enough emphasis on the treatment and prevention and education part of it.
Q. Would the decriminalization or legalization of certain drugs reduce the street crime tied to drugs?
A. Not in my opinion. That's a cop-out. The problem with our society is that we look for instantaneous cures. There is no such animal.
We have to be prepared to deal with a 50-year-old problem with long-term solutions, not short-term fixes. We have to deal with the reasons people use drugs, Unemployment, housing, lack of educational, vocational and professional opportunities. Suddenly saying that now it's legal for people to use drugs, and taking the street value out of it, is not going to solve the problem.
One of the things that concerns me is that there are still school districts in which the school administrations, board and possibly the parents have their heads in the sand, figuring this is a problem that does not affect them. There may be 10 or 12 districts where we feel this is a problem, and we're going to have to try to implement some program to get them involved in their communities.
One of the problems is that some of these districts feel that if they get involved with my department, this is an indication, an acknowledgement, that they have a serious problem. Nothing could be further from the truth. We have to dispel that myth.

HEADLINE: 'Lost' S.& L. Money Is Still Out There

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"No Taxes Needed in Savings and Loan Bailout," Robert Eisner's Oct. 10 letter, provides a neat demonstration of the dangers of metaphorical reasoning in economics. Professor Eisner argues that printing new money to bail out savings and loan depositors would be noninflationary, because the new money would merely replace money "lost" by the savings and loan industry. The argument assumes there is no difference between money "lost" as a result of bad loans and money lost in a fire.
But there is a big difference: money lost in a fire is gone for good, whereas money lost through bad loans (like money lost in casinos) is lost to someone, for example, borrowers and those whose goods are purchased with borrowed funds. The billions "lost" by the savings and loan industry have not gone up in smoke, but have wandered somewhere beyond their lenders' reach.
Professor Eisner's argument, in short, makes as much sense as the claim that breeding new kittens to replace all "lost" cats will not increase the cat population. The claim is true if the "lost" cats have all died, but false if they have merely wandered away. Dollars wander away all the time, but they seldom die unless the Federal Reserve chooses to kill them.

HEADLINE: New York City Is Hurt But Still Has Reserves;
Entertainment: Still a World Stage, But With Problems

BYLINE: By William H. Honan

 BODY:
Broadway, the arts and tourism still command a world spotlight, and in the last 10 years they have nearly doubled the number of people they employ -- to more than 50,000. But economic problems have led to worries about the future.
 Airport and Amtrak arrivals are up this year, and in the first six months of 1990, attendance at tourist attractions remained level with 1989.
"There are five billion people on the planet," said Marshall E. Murdaugh, president of New York City's Convention and Visitors Bureau. "Almost half of them speak some English, and most of those want to visit New York."
And Martin E. Segal, chairman of the New York International Festival of the Arts, said New York remained "the place where artists come to gain worldwide recognition."
"If the arts continued to flourish in London during the blitz," he said, "you can bet they will continue here."
But the restaurant business is down, as many New Yorkers are eating out less frequently. More than 130,000 people are employed at restaurants and bars in New York City, a slight decline from 1989.
 
'Things Are Good,' for Now
 Although 9 of the Shubert Organization's 17 theaters are dark at the moment, Gerald Schoenfeld, the chairman, said the shows that were running were highly profitable. "Things are good," he said.
Yet Mr. Schoenfeld took a dimmer view of the future. "If the performing arts are going to survive, there will have to be major adjustments in work rules, salary scales and city policy toward theater buildings, which cannot now be operated profitably," he said.
Off Broadway producers expressed some optimism, saying that an economic downturn was more likely to hurt large, expensive Broadway productions.
And at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, William H. Luers, the president, noted, "An institution like ours does well when things get tough -- we're cheap."
On the negative side, Mr. Luers said, 20 percent of the museum's support comes from the city, and "when the city is forced to cut its budget, arts institutions are sure to suffer."
Mary Schmidt Campbell, the Commissioner of New York City's Department of Cultural Affairs, warned of "a decentralization and gradual diffusion of cultural institutions away from New York." She said this could occur because of "an unusual confluence of events" -- including the 1986 Tax Reform Act, the 1987 stock market crash, political challenges to the National Endowment for the Arts, the flattening of corporate sponsorship and the economic problems of the city.
"We can't be complacent," she said, "We've got to be resourceful."

HEADLINE: New York City Is Hurt But Still Has Reserves;
Wall Street: A Pivotal Role, Even in Bad Times

BYLINE: By Leslie Wayne

 BODY:
There will always be a Wall Street.
 For nearly two centuries, New York City has been the financial capital of the nation and one of the pillars of the world's financial system. And despite the current gloomy atmos phere -- punctuated by huge layoffs at brokerage houses, declining business and the collapse of several firms -- many people say New York's securities industry is not threatened.
Still, Wall Street may never quite return to the manic 1980's, when it helped propel the city's and the nation's economies.
"I see an industry that has grown almost exponentially for the last decade and accumuluated a head count that cannot be sustained," said Samuel L. Hayes 3d, a finance professor at the Harvard Business School. "But to be at the cutting edge of investment banking, it means being on the cutting edge of market intelligence, and that's not easy from Dubuque."
The turning point for Wall Street came with the stock market crash of Oct. 19, 1987. Since then, employment has fallen by about 27,000 people, to 137,000, and it continues to plummet. Large firms like E. F. Hutton & Company and Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. are now history. And other major firms like Morgan Stanley & Company have talked about moving to the suburbs.
Professor Hayes doubts that any leading firm will leave the city -- largely because most high-profit lines of business depend on the personal interaction of skilled financiers.
 
'A Lot of Consolidation'
 But "it will be different," said Lowell L. Bryan, a director at McKinsey & Company, adding: "Wall Street will never have as many highly paid people as in the past decade. We will see a lot of consolidation. Technology will continue to replace people."
Wall Street has taken hits besides the '87 crash. Many of its businesses, like money market funds, have turned into high-volume, low-margin ventures, and deregulation has brought in tough competition from commercial banks.
Fortunately, opportunities have emerged from foreign demand for access to American markets and from the growing market for financial ventures that cross international borders. "Wall Street would be a lot smaller if it were not for globalization," said Robert S. Salomon Jr., a managing director at Salomon Brothers.
But over all, Wall Street seems to be looking toward a quieter future. "The 1980's was a period of excess that is unlikely to be repeated," said Michael Goldstein, an analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein & Company.

HEADLINE: Pillars Under Stress: New York's Economy - A Special Report;
New York City Is Hurt But Still Has Reserves

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE

 BODY:
Every so often, New Yorkers find themselves whistling past the graveyard. A recession sets in. Longstanding economic ills, masked during good times, recapture attention. And the city seems to be fading, perhaps irreversibly, as a great financial headquarters and as the center of creative industries.
This is one of those moments.
The question is, will the city pull out, as it always has, with most of its economic pillars in place, or is it sinking into permanent decline?
 
Some Surprising Strengths
 A close look at various segments of the economy of New York City and the interconnected suburbs finds some surprising strengths -- through public-works projects, Wall Street's resilience and in the entertainment industry, for example -- and little evidence of irreversible decline. But almost all of the great enterprises that have made this metropolitan area, with its 19 million people what it is, are facing complicated problems. 
 Some of these industries -- banking, retailing and network television, in particular -- may well emerge as permanently slimmed down from their 1980's levels, forcing many people to find work elsewhere or in other fields.
The securities industry, which helped drive the boom of the 80's, seems destined to remain headquartered in New York, as a major world force. Indeed, despite the recent layoffs, the investment houses are larger in numbers of people employed than they were when the boom started in 1982 -- although Wall Street will probably not generate in the 90's the kind of wealth that made tens of thousands of New Yorkers rich in the 80's.
 
Adjusting to the 90's
 Other industries that have historically drawn wealth to the city also seem to be adjusting to the 90's, more or less successfully. The entertainment industry in many ways is hotter than ever. But rising costs and America's growing regional entertainment threaten its prosperity. Almost all the nation's leading advertising agencies are still in New York. But some production operations are moving out, also because of rising costs. And the nation's large book publishers are clearly anchored in Manhattan. But they no longer generate new jobs.
In an odd way, an important positive factor in the New York area economy at present is public spending, even in the midst of budget crises here and almost everywhere in the nation. Not in decades has so much money gone for public works in the area -- airports, highways, bridges, sewers, subways and other projects. Roughly $12 billion will be spent in the metropolitan region in the current fiscal year.
Such government outlays are a healthy counterforce to a 43 percent decline since 1987 in the value of new private construction, a decline related to the sharp drop in real estate prices.
Government has also been a stronghold for new employment. Today, the metropolitan area's various governments employ 1.2 million people, half of them within New York City, out of a total work force of 7.6 million, half of which is also within the city. While nearly every industry in the private sector has been reducing payrolls since spring, government hiring has risen, maintaining an annual growth rate of 20,000 people since 1987.
But the growing shortage of tax revenue threatens the public sector as an important economic stimulus. In fact, Mayor David N. Dinkins's announcement on Friday that more than 10,000 city jobs are to be eliminated represents the first major reversal of the government hiring trend since 1982.
 
An Army of Immigrants
 The New York economic machine has also been getting a powerful push from its army of immigrants. By most estimates, people born abroad now constitute 30 percent of the city's population of more than seven million, a huge source of labor and entrepreneurial energy. Immigrants have been especially well represented in manufacturing jobs, although these jobs have been disappearing from New York City for 40 years. In apparel making, one of the two large manufacturing industries left (the other is printing), immigrants constitute an estimated 40 percent of the 100,000 workers.
Because of its long decline, manufacturing has ceased to be thought of as a reliable underpinning. Yet it still gives work to 350,000 people within the city -- and a million in the metropolitan area -- putting the city and its suburbs among the nation's six largest manufacturing centers.
There are those who believe New York cannot permanently remain vibrant without a reversal in the decline of manufacturing, a decline often attributed to adverse government policies and high operating costs. Labor costs were part of the problem in earlier times, but have become less of an issue in recent years, notwithstanding the current strike at The Daily News, where costly work rules are at issue.
 
Powerful Stimulus Is Gone
 Some urban experts argue that manufacturing is essential to provide the economic diversity needed for sustained growth. That concern was forgotten in the 80's. The Wall Street boom, the corporate takeovers, the huge flow of foreign investment into the United States, with New York City as the gateway, seemed to lift all boats. In fact, most of New York's income growth went to Wall Street's people, while the average earnings of others barely kept up with inflation.
Wall Street's powerful stimulus is gone now. Still, many experts maintain that the framework remains -- not only the bankers, lawyers, accountants and brokers that make New York a world financial center, but also the theaters, museums, orchestras and artistic groups that sustain the city as the nation's cultural center.
The problem lies in keeping this structure in place during the recession. No single industry is likely in the 90's to generate the good times that Wall Street made possible in the 80's.
But many experts note that the city government's finances are in far better shape than they were in the 70's, when New York nearly went bankrupt, and thus public spending, even in the current budget crisis, is in a better position to help minimize the recession's impact. Others argue that manufacturing is not likely to decline as sharply in the 90's as it did during the city's last recession, from 1969 to 1977.
If hope, then, for the future is alive, there is equal realization that the next few years will be hard. "My guess is that we are in for a long recession," said Ray Horton, an economist and the president of the Citizens Budget Commission. "But some sort of hot thing will probably come along, and you and I will say, 'Why did we not see it?' "

HEADLINE: Uncertainty At Computer Exposition

BYLINE: By PETER H. LEWIS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LAS VEGAS, Nev., Nov. 11

 BODY:
Amid a mixture of glitz and uncertainty, Comdex/Fall, the world's largest annual exposition of computer products, opens here Monday for a weeklong trade show expected to attract 100,000 buyers and sellers, nearly a fifth from overseas.
The glitz, impressive even by the standards of this neon-washed desert city, is provided by 1,800 companies, from the International Business Machines Corporation to tiny start-ups hoping for a big break. The First Interface Group of Needham, Mass., which produces the Comdex shows, said the exhibitors will fill more than a million square feet of display space and will demonstrate an unusually large number of new products. 
 The uncertainty arises from how well those new products will sell if the economy falters, as many people here expect.
 
 'Like Christmas Shopping'
 "From a product standpoint, this is the most interesting and exciting Comdex in several years," said Lissa Morgenthaler, senior analyst for the California Technology Stock Letter in San Francisco. "It's a little like Christmas shopping for me, but the companies will be feeling a fair amount of trepidation."
"Excitement isn't always what a company wants," she noted. "Certainty is sometimes better."
Among the new products are miniature portable computers that match the power of desktop PC's, software applications designed to take advantage of the Microsoft Corporation's DOS-Windows operating system, storage devices that can hold billions of characters of data, and powerful Unix-based work stations, which will compete with both conventional PC's and more costly minicomputers and mainframes.
Dealers at the show will be wrestling with fundamental changes in the way businesses now shop for PC's. As small computers become more powerful and complex, and as networked PC's become more important, the traditional retail channels are being squeezed by specialized dealers and warehouse-style discounters.

HEADLINE: Freedom Bank's Failure Hits Harlem Like a Death in the Family

BYLINE: By ANDREW L. YARROW

 BODY:
The failure of the Freedom National Bank of New York last week was more than just the demise of another shaky financial institution. It was also a symbolic blow to Harlem, where the bank was based, and marked the end of an idealistic venture begun during the height of the civil-rights movement.
"This is devastating to our community and the city," Representative Charles B. Rangel said in an interview. The Congressman, whose district includes Harlem, is working with Mayor David N. Dinkins and a group of black clergymen in a last-minute effort to rescue Freedom, which was one of America's largest black-owned banks. "Symbolically, it's a terrible blow, becausethis was a black bank formed by Jackie Robinson that was more sensitive to the businesses and people in this community." 
 Many depositors have come to the heavily guarded bank, and learned that the F.D.I.C. plans to begin issuing refund checks for deposits up to $100,000 at the 125th Street and the Flatbush branches beginning tomorrow.
The bank, which had $101.9 million in assets and two branches in Brooklyn, had been riven by internal power struggles and had lost money in the last few years due to an increasing number of defaults on bad loans. Yet, many black political and business leaders, as well as many of the bank's 22,000 depositors and 97 employees, were shocked and saddened when agents of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation descendedon the bank's main office at 275 West 125th Street on Friday afternoon.
"It makes me feel helpless, like I've been robbed," said Abiodun, a poet who had an account with the bank. "It's a step backward for the empowerment of black people."
Abiodun stood in front of the bank, whose windows were plastered with notices from the F.D.I.C. and the Comptroller of the Currency and whose offices were swarming with 60 F.D.I.C. employees over the weekend. "Freedom Bank," he said, "is now an enslaved bank."
"I'm sick," said Emily Ricks, a real-estate broker who was a shareholder in the bank. "I've had money in Freedom from the beginning, and we have mortgages with it. Ilose and Harlem loses."
The Rev. M. Moran Weston, who in 1949 helped found Carver Savings, a black-owned savings and loan based in Harlem, said: "Freedom is a loss to the entire African-American community, because of the importance of having black institutions involved in economic activities."
Freedom was founded in 1964 by a group of investors that included Jackie Robinson and Dunbar McLaurin, a lawyer, at a time when there were almost no black-owned lending institutions and it was difficult for many blacks to obtain loans from large banks.
"The idea was that the cultural heart of black America should have a commercial bank," said the Rev. Wyatt Tee Walker, a former chairman of Freedom's board and the pastor at Canaan Baptist Church of Christ. "Many small businesses and churches in Harlem bought stock in the bank -- not with the idea that they'd reap any benefit, but rather that Freedom would be a financial resource for people in the minority community to get loans."
After a shaky first decade, the bank's fortunes improved under Hughlyn F. Fierce, an executive with Chase Manhattan Bank who was brought in to serve as Freedom's president for two years. He helped rescue it in 1975, at a time of plunging assets and mounting losses, by getting 11 large banks to invest a total of $4 million. Freedom became consistently profitable around 1977, when Sharnia (Tab) Buford was named president, and its net return on assets was one of the highest of any New York bank in the early 1980's.
Despite its financial success, the bank always attempted to balance fiscal prudence and profitability against its founders' goal of helping small businesses and home-buyers in black neighborhoods by offering low-cost loans. The bank also provided financing for redevelopment projects.
 
A Greater Responsibility
 "We had to be businesslike and our credit criteria couldn't be different from banks downtown," Mr. Buford recalled. "But we also had a greater responsibility because we were chartered as a minority bank. We had to empathize with the customer."
Mr. Buford was ousted in 1986 in a power struggle, and critics such as Mr. Walker say that those who succeeded him were too ambitious.
"They pointed the bank in a different direction, expecting bigger profits, and they wanted to multiply its assets five or six times," Mr. Walker said. That, he added, "contributed to its demise."
In 1988, yet another management team, led by George A. Russell Jr. and Isaiah Robinson Jr., took over, but was unable to attract enough new investors or staunch the bank's growing losses. Freedom lost $1.9 million in 1988 and $2.8 million last year, according to David M. Barr, an F.D.I.C. spokesman. This year's losses were expected to exceed $2 million.
 
Contacted Scores of Banks
 Last month the Comptroller of the Currency, who regulates national banks, notified the F.D.I.C. that Freedom would have to close, Mr. Barr said. "We began contacting scores of banks locally and nationally for a bidder, but none came forward to buy Freedom."
Harlem clergymen and political leaders, including Mr. Walker and Mr. Rangel, appealed yesterday to the city's financial community to help resurrect the bank with an infusion of at least $6 million before a deadline of 9 A.M. tomorrow, when the F.D.I.C. begins paying depositors.
To save the bank, investors would need to obtain a bank charter or an existing bank would have to work out a way of taking over Freedom's assets or deposits from the F.D.I.C.
Supporters of the bank are seeking to extend the deadline to Friday.
 
Rescue Efforts

"Had this been a white bank of comparable size and circumstance, the decision to shut its doors would not have been made so precipitously," Mr. Walker said at a news conference in front of the bank yesterday.
About $2 million had been pledged by last night, said Eugene Webb, a Harlem realtor and a member of Freedom's board of directors, who said that he believed that enough money could be raised to reopen the bank under a new charter.
If the rescue effort is unsuccessful, the bank's supporters said that they would consider establishing a new bank, but that the country's current economic problems would make that difficult.
"It will be a profound tragedy and a stunning defeat for the people of Harlem, especially in view of the coming depression," said Wilbert Tatum, the publisher of The Amsterdam News, a weekly newspaper based in Harlem. "There has to be a move within the community to bolster its financial health, because help won't come from the outside."

HEADLINE: MIDEAST TENSIONS;
Egypt Angry at Former Arab Allies

BYLINE: By JUDITH MILLER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CAIRO, Nov. 9

 BODY:
In a reflection of the bitterness that Egypt holds toward former Arab allies over the Iraqi seizing of Kuwait, senior Government officials here have traced the Iraqi invasion to what they call a conspiracy more than a year old involving Jordan and Yemen as well as Baghdad.
In interviews this week, a senior official described the framework of what he charged was an intricate conspiracy among the three countries to isolate Saudi Arabia and enable Iraq to seize not only Kuwait but also the United Arab Emirates. The official said that efforts to secure Cairo's acquiesence in this culminated last February in what he characterized as a not-so-subtle attempt to bribe Egypt. 
 The senior official, whose account was elaborated on by other officials, offered only circumstantial evidence and no documentation or other hard evidence to support the charges.
The belief in a conspiracy is widely held by Egyptian officials, reportedly even by President Hosni Mubarak, and reflects the bitterness and suspicion that Egypt harbors toward the three countries with which it was closely aligned only three months ago. Since Egypt is at the forefront of Arab opposition to the seizing of Kuwait, this belief also complicates efforts to devise an "Arab solution" to the gulf crisis.
 
Secret Contacts Described
 In interviews, the senior Egyptian official and others, all of whom spoke on condition that they not be further identified, described a series of heretofore secret contacts and efforts by King Hussein of Jordan and President Ali Abdullah Saleh of Yemen to transform the Arab Cooperation Council, an economic and political group consisting of Iraq, Egypt, Jordan and Yemen, into a military organization.
Egyptians now say that the council, whose members are situated around Saudi Arabia, was an important vehicle through which Iraq attempted to neutralize Cairo and dominate the Saudi Government in Riyadh.
King Hussein and other Jordanian officials have vehemently denied the Egyptian charges, as has the Yemeni leader, but the conspiracy plot has gained wide currency in countries that oppose President Saddam Hussein of Iraq. Jordan and Yemen have both expressed considerable sympathy for Iraq, trying to adopt what they call a "neutral" stance by condemning both Iraq's invasion of Kuwait and the presence of American forces in the gulf.
The Arab Cooperation Council was launched in Baghdad in February 1989, ostensibly to foster economic cooperation among Iraq and nations had strongly supported Iraq during its war with Iran.
But, the official said, even before its formal creation, King Hussein, the group's prime mover, repeatedly tried to broaden its mandate by turning it into a defense and security group, with its own integrated military and intelligence structure.
The Egyptians said the aim was to use the council to enmesh Cairo in military and political entanglements with Iraq that would limit Egypt's flexibility and effectively neutralize it after the invasion.
 
Jordanian's First Approach
 Late in 1987, King Hussein initially discussed the idea of the council with President Mubarak, according to the Egyptian account. The King presented it as an Arab version of the European Community. But he also said it should have a military component, a suggestion that immediately aroused Mr. Mubarak's suspicions, the official said.
Mr. Mubarak asked King Hussein whether he had discussed his concept with King Fahd of Saudi Arabia. "Riyadh might have some objections to an alliance of countries that did not include it but that shared its borders, particularly if such a group had a military dimension," the official said.
The official said that King Hussein told Mr. Mubarak that the Saudis had approved the idea. Later that day, the official said, Mr. Mubarak called King Fahd, who became agitated when he heard of the plan for a military alliance, insisting that King Hussein had not mentioned it. The Saudi ruler immediately sent an envoy to Cairo to discuss the proposal.
The Egyptian President told the envoy that he would insure that the group would not evolve into a military organization and that it "would never be used as an ax against Saudi Arabia," the official said.
When Mr. Mubarak toured gulf countries in January 1989, he found that King Hussein had also failed to mention the proposed defense dimension of the council to any head of state there, the official asserted.
When the agreement to form the council was launched at a signing ceremony in Baghdad in February 1989, the Prime Ministers of the member nations were summoned to a meeting shortly before midnight. Until 3 A.M., "they kept pushing for a military clause in the agreement," the official said, referring to Jordan, Yemen and Iraq. But Mr. Mubarak had instructed his Prime Minister to refuse; the next day, the ceremony took place without a military dimension in the agreement.
 
Two Version of Agreement
 In July 1989, the four leaders met again in Alexandria, Egypt, to approve the council's new charter. Mr. Mubarak again found himself under pressure to add a defense and security component to the group's mandate, the official said. Moreover, the official said, Mr. Mubarak found that two versions of the charter agreement had been prepared. Only when Egypt refused to sign the military version was a second version produced and signed, the official said.
At the first anniversary of the council's creation in February 1990, the leaders met privately. King Hussein said that Jordan and Iraq intended to propose the creation of an "Arab cooperation fund" to channel at least $5 billion a year in aid from the gulf oil states to poorer Arab nations.
King Hussein told Mr. Mubarak that "Egypt would get the lion's share," the official said. But Mr. Mubarak refused. "Egypt will not appear to be begging for money from other Arabs," Mr. Mubarak was quoted as having replied.
The official said that after the invasion, Mr. Mubarak concluded that the fund proposal was an attempt to bribe Egypt into condoning a long-planned aggression against Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates. The official noted that Iraq's bellicose speeches in the months preceding the invasion were directed at both countries. But unlike Kuwait, the emirates asked the United States for a show of support; joint maneuvers were held in the Persian Gulf in July.
The official said that Mr. Mubarak also became suspicious of the council forum because President Hussein rarely voiced proposals to which Egypt objected. "King Hussein always seemed to be carrying the message for him," the official said. Mr. Mubarak began to feel isolated in the council.
At an Arab League meeting in Baghdad in February 1990, Mr. Mubarak's feeling of exclusion intensified. The leaders were in bungalows near one another, the official said. Mr. Mubarak saw King Hussein and Saddam Hussein "walking and talking in the garden. Then President Hussein would visit President Saleh of Yemen." But he did not pay a special visit to Mr. Mubarak, the official said. When Mr. Mubarak inquired why not, President Hussein replied that he thought Mr. Mubarak had already left the gathering.
 
Visit by Iraqi's Brother
 The final example of what the official called "Iraqi duplicity" involving the council occurred 10 days before the invasion. On very short notice, President Hussein's brother, the chief of Iraqi intelligence, arrived in Cairo to propose an intelligence-sharing arrangement between Egypt and Iraq and then other council members. Egypt said no.
"In restropsect, it was obvious that military cooperation was to be the sine qua non of the A.C.C.," the official said. "It really persuaded us that the aggression against Kuwait was long-planned, and that members of the A.C.C. were part of this conspiracy."
King Hussein, who has repeatedly denied any advance knowledge of the invasion, denied in interviews last month having participated in such a conspiracy. He confirmed that he had proposed a military dimension for the council, but said he quickly dropped it when Mr. Mubarak objected.
He did not understand, the King said in a telephone interview on Friday, why Egypt and Saudi Arabia had found the idea of a military component for the council so threatening.
The King said he had hoped that the Arab Cooperation Council would foster cooperation and even greater unity between Arab states and Egypt, which had been long ostracized over its peace treaty with Israel. "There was no conspiracy," he declared.
President Saleh of Yemen also denied in an interview two weeks ago having participated in any conspiracy. "What is the basis for these charges?" he asked with extreme agitation. "Where is the proof? Where is the evidence? I have been direct in all my dealings with Arab states. No one can say anything else."

Nunn, Citing 'Rush' to War, Assails Decision to Drop Troop Rotation Plan

BYLINE: By MICHAEL R. GORDON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 10

 BODY:
The chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee today criticized the Bush Administration's decision to drop its plan to rotate troops in Saudi Arabia, saying that it puts the United States on too fast a track toward war.
Senate Sam Nunn, the Georgia Democrat who heads the committee, said that the decision to drop the troop rotation plan was a "mistake." He said that the move unduly limited the United States' options and added that President Bush should consider reversing it. 
 The abandonment of the rotation plan reflects the Bush Administration's apparent decision to speed up the timetable for resolving the Persian Gulf crisis, by persuading Iraq to withdraw its troops or by using force to drive Iraq out of Kuwait.
In addition, the decision not to rotate troops in itself appeared to add to the pressure to resolve the crisis soon before the morale of American and allied soldiers deteriorates.
 
Debate on Force Intensified
 In the wake of the earlier Administration decision to heavily reinforce United States forces in Saudi Arabia, the move to cancel troop rotation has intensified the policy debate over the question of when and whether military force should be used.
Critics of the Administration's apparent direction note that the Washington kept troops in Europe for 40 years before the decline of the Soviet economy encouraged Moscow to start withdrawing its forces. They say that it is too late to save Kuwait from destruction at the hands of the Iraqis and too soon to tell if economic sanctions will force Iraq to remove its forces from Kuwait. Why not wait a year or more for the economic sanctions to work before ordering an attack that would led to American casualties? some critics ask.
"The first thing the President has to say is why we're in such a hurry," Senator Nunn said on the CBS News program "Face the Nation."
"I haven't been told the reasons why we have to rush this thing," Mr. Nunn said. "Why not let the embargo work?"
 
'A Host of Questions'
 "It's one thing to say it's important -- and it is important -- that Kuwait be liberated and that we're going to use economic sanctions to do so," Senator Nunn added. "It's another thing to say that America is going to take on the mission -- with some help, but not a lot of help -- to confront Iraq and to liberate Kuwait. That's a different mission and raises a host of questions."
While the Bush Administration says publicly that it has not given up on economic sanctions, a senior Administration official who asked not to be identified said that the Administration does not want to wait a long time to see if they will work.
The senior official added that Arab resentment against the American military presence might grow if the United States keeps large number of troops in Saudi Arabia for a prolonged period. The official also expressed concern that American fighting men might lose their edge and that the multinational coalition arrayed against Iraq might unravel if the crisis remained unresolved for an extended period.
Beyond that, the official said it was necessary to send more than 150,000 troops to the region and move toward a quicker resolution of the crisis to shock President Saddam Hussein of Iraq into taking American threats to use force seriously.
 
Aspin Supports Administration
 In a sign of the sharpening divisions over Adminstration policy, Representative Les Aspin, the chairman the House Armed Services Committee, split with Mr. Nunn, his Senate counterpart, and voiced strong support for the Administration decision to send reinforcements to the Persian Gulf and to cancel plans for rotating troops.
"I think the combination of sending more troops and the no rotation policy says the critical crunch point comes sometime between the end of January and probably the first of March," Mr. Aspin, a Wisconsin Democrat, said on the ABC News program "This Week."
"Somewhere in there is the time that there will be a decision made, probably an ultimatum delivered to Saddam Hussein, and if he doesn't respond, I think it probably means war," Mr. Aspin added.
Asked if whether the United States ought to go to war if Iraq refused to withdraw its troops from Kuwait, Mr. Aspin said: " I think that we definitely will, if there's no progress, and I think that's the right policy to adopt."
 
No Explanation, Nunn Says
 In contrast, Mr. Nunn complained that President Bush had not yet provided an explanation of how American military forces might be used in the gulf.
He said, "Getting bogged down in a ground war there is the last thing we want, and plays right into Saddam Hussein's hands and makes our logistic difficulties, which are already present, much more difficult."
Offensive action against Iraq, Senator Nunn said, "is something the military were not given to begin with and were not prepared for."
"And I think the President has a real obligation here," he added, "to explain why liberating Kuwait is in our vital interest."
 
Role of Congress Asserted
 Mr. Nunn said that Congressional leaders were notified before the Administration decided to send massive reinforcements to the Gulf and were not consulted until the decision to end rotation and send more than 150,000 additional troops was made. He said that he and other Congressional leaders would meet with Mr. Bush and Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney this week.
Senator Nunn and Representative Aspin agreed that the Administration should seek Congressional approval if it decided to wage war against Iraq.
Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, the Maine Democrat, said that the Administration had informed him that no decision has been made to attack Iraqi forces. The Senator added that any such action would require a formal declaration by Congress.
If the President decides to attack Iraq, Senator Mitchell said, "he must come to Congress and ask for a declaration."
"If he does not get it, then there is no legal authority for the United States to go to war," he added.

HEADLINE: SUNY Campus in Cornfields Cultivates an Ivy Reputation

BYLINE: By LISA W. FODERARO, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: GENESEO, N.Y.

 BODY:
In the Genesee River Valley, the ivy-covered buildings of the State University of New York's College of Arts and Sciences at Geneseo soar startlingly out of the surrounding cornfields.
So, in recent years, has SUNY Geneseo itself, becoming one of the nation's most selective, highly regarded public colleges. 
 How the school accomplished this says much about the course of higher education in the 1980's, particularly the power of marketing and national publicity, and the growing appeal of the relatively low tuition at public colleges. But its setbacks also suggest the problems ahead for public colleges.
 
Lobbying for a Tuition Increase
 Geneseo succeeded by becoming more exclusive, educating the middle class rather than the working class, in part by offering these students a tuition bargain. Yet its success has not protected it from the budget problems facing public universities across the Northeast. Facing cuts in academic departments and programs, its students andfaculty members are trying something rarely done in higher education, public or private. They are lobbying for a tuition increase.
"Our tuition is too low -- it's terrible -- and the whole system could collapse," said Ron Herzman, a professor of English. "We have a chance to really be good, to be as good as some people say we are, and it could go either way."
School officials set out in the late 1970's to reverse declines in applications and standards by shoring up marketing, making academic programs more rigorous and becoming choosier about admissions.
"We hypothesized that there was a niche in the market for a small selective liberal arts college that might represent a reasonable alternative for the best and brightest kids whose parents didn't want to spend $20,000 a year," said William L. Caren, a former dean of admissions.
Tuition is now $1,350 a year, and room and board bring costs to about $6,500. SUNY officials said last week that Chancellor D. Bruce Johnstone is considering asking the Legislature for a tuition increase of between $50 and $100 for the spring semester to head off the effects of a new round of budget cuts.
SUNY Geneseo has strengths, starting with a Gothic-style campus bordered on one side by a Main Street listed on the National Register of Historic Places. In the 1970's, it had some solid departments, and one of the system's least-tenured faculties, leaving room for new talent.
The administration began emphasizing teaching over research, and stressed the humanities, rich in required readings from Plato to Shakespeare to Freud.
The admissions office wrote to high-school guidance counselors, sent recruiters across the state, urged students to visit the campus and added an essay requirement to the generic SUNY application. A new poster showed two students under a Gothic arch and read: "A Touch of New England in Western New York."
 
Ranked 2d After New College
 Then in 1986 Money magazine included Geneseo in an article on state colleges titled "Ten Colleges With an Ivy Twist." National publicity continued, and this fall the "Money Guide: America's Best College Buys," ranked Geneseo second among public colleges nationwide, behind only New College, which is part of the University of South Florida, in Tampa.
As applications grew, admission became tougher. The college accepted less than a third of the 9,296 applicants in 1988, compared with 78 percent of the 4,378 in 1979. The high-school grade average of incoming freshmen rose to 92 this year from 84 in 1979, while the average score on the Scholastic Aptitude Test rose to 1160 from 990.
"The whole thing has just gone off the charts," said Geneseo's president, Dr. Carol Harter.
David Truax, the university's associate vice chancellor for access services in Albany, said, "People in SUNY's central administration marvel at what Geneseo has been able to accomplish."
Allan W. Ostar, president of the American Association of State Colleges and Universities in Washington, said: "It's not just the cost. Even more to the point is the growing recognition of the increasing quality of an institution like Geneseo."
 
Not Worth $16,000 More
 Cost, however, is a major factor for both students and the ratings, which are unpopular among many educators who believe they serve mainly to focus attention on a narrow range of schools.
"The rankings reflects the new mentality of students and parents, which is that they are looking for the best education for their dollar," said Christine R. Paulson, a research policy analyst for the Education Commission of the States in Denver.
Jeff Fenton of Webster, N.Y., transferred from a community college to Geneseo in September, turning down Cornell and Brown.
"What those schools held over Geneseo was that they had better buildings on campus and more diversity in the student body, and that didn't seem worth the extra $16,000 a year," said Mr. Fenton, who expects to spend about $6,500 this year on tuition, room and board, fees and expenses.
The change in Geneseo's mission has also transformed the student body. While 10 years ago most students were the first in their families to attend college, now most are the second or third generation. While most have grants, loans or jobs, a majority come from families with incomes over $50,000.
New York's university system does not recruit out of state, and so Geneseo's students are overwhelmingly from New York. But the college draws students from 59 of the state's 62 counties, a broad reach for a SUNY campus. While Monroe and Erie Counties, to the immediate north and west, account for 25 percent of the freshman class, Suffolk County on the east end of Long Island sends 11 percent.
 
'I Miss Steelworkers' Kids'
 Changes in the demographics are cause for some misgivings.
"The downside for me is that the people who come here are a little too suburban and homogenized," said Prof. Ron Herzman of the English department. "What I miss are the kids of Buffalo steelworkers who didn't know they were smart till they got here."
Dr. James H. Willey, a music professor, said: "Today's students are very bright and interesting. But sometimes, when I see a student driving a BMW, I say, 'Ah-hah!' They can have the expensive car because their parents are saving money on college."
Officials defend both their product and their consumers. "The fact is most of our students couldn't afford a Cornell or a Brown," the provost, Donald S. Spencer, said. "And a liberal arts education should not be limited to the most affluent in our society."
 
9 Percent Are Minorities
 Administrators say a priority is attracting a better racial, ethnic and socio-economic mix without lowering standards. The student body is still overwhelmingly white and Protestant or Catholic. Nine percent of this year's 1,135 freshmen were minorities.
"Those improvements have to be redoubled," Dr. Spencer said.
Despite SUNY's guiding principle of accessibility to all high school students, officials in the central administration say there is room within the system for a University Center, like Binghamton, which has long been highly competitive, and now a college like Geneseo. Many campuses, especially the community colleges, have open admissions.
 
Money, the Grim Reaper
 The entire state university system in New York has benefited from the growing cost-consciousness of families as the state has held tuition steady since 1983. The share of all New York high school graduates who applied to at least one of 49 of the system's campuses including Geneseo rose to 41 percent last year from 29 percent in 1979.
The lack of money looms as a sort of grim reaper. In the 1980's, as Governor Cuomo kept tuition flat, Geneseo cut maintenance workers, raised the student-faculty ratio and, to save on fuel, turned down the heat, even bursting the pipes in one dormitory.
A tuition increase alone would not solve SUNY's budget crisis, administrators say, since a $100 hike generates only about $10 million. SUNY's budget gap for next year is estimated to be between $300 million and $400 million.
So far, Geneseo has spared its academic program. But officials expect large cuts that could mean the loss of departments and faculty members. "There isn't any fat left," Dr. Spencer said. "The students at Geneseo would welcome a tuition increase if they knew the money would go into the instructional program instead of a black hole in state government."

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
New Rate Cut By Fed Panel Is Predicted

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
Credit market analysts say they expect the Federal Reserve's Open Market Committee to approve another cut in a key short-term interest rate when the policy-making group meets in Washington tomorrow.
Deep-seated concern about inflationary pressures is likely to prompt at least two committee members, F. Lee Hoskins, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland, and Wayne D. Angell, a governor of the Fed, to oppose the move. 
 But private analysts say mounting evidence that the economy may have slipped into a recession will probably sway the majority to approve a cut in the overnight Federal funds rate to 7.5 percent, from its current 7.75 percent target rate.
 
 'Early Stages of Recession'
 "I would be very surprised if the Fed didn't ease," said Donald J. Fine, chief market analyst at the Chase Manhattan Bank. "We are in the early stages of a recession, one whose mildness or severity is still in question. And the lack of economic activity will help to fight inflation."
A cut in the funds rate would be the second in less than a month. Responding to a Federal budget package that earmarks close to $500 billion in savings over the next five years, the Fed reduced the funds rate in late October by 25 basis points.
Though they would welcome it, another quarter-point cut in the funds rate would come as no surprise to market participants. Moreover, commercial bankers said last week that a cut of that size would probably not be large enough to prompt banks to reduce their prime lending rate, which has stood at 10 percent since early January.
Yet, if history is a guide, a drop in the funds rate to 7.5 percent should lead to a cut in the prime rate. In the past, banks have tended to reduce their most visible rate when the gap between the prime and their own cost of funds is about two percentage points.
Cynthia Latta, a senior financial economist at DRI McGraw-Hill, the economic forecasting firm, says the spread between the rates is already unusually wide.
Using a weighted average cost of funds that includes three-month Eurodollar rates, three-month certificate of deposit rates and Federal funds, Ms. Latta said the spread between those costs and the prime was now 225 basis points. Normally, the spread is about 175 basis points, she added.
 
 Abnormal Problems Cited
 Bankers acknowledge that the differential is wider than normal. But they add that at this juncture financial problems within the banking system are decidedly abnormal and therefore warrant a wider spread.
"In general, I don't think you will see the banks react favorably" to a quarter-point cut in the funds rate, said Alan C. Lerner, a managing director at the Bankers Trust Comapny. "In normal times it might be enough to get the prime down. But right now the banks want to build back profit margins."
Mr. Lerner and others said a move by the Fed to cut the funds rate to 7.25 percent, either all at once or in two moves, would almost certainly lead to a cut in the prime rate to 9.5 percent.
"If you wanted to get a quick and dramatic reduction in the prime, you would have to cut the funds rate by 50 basis points," said another banker, who spoke on condition that he not be identified.
 
 Spur for Decline in Rates
 Confidence that the Fed will move soon to ease credit conditions was a driving force behind the drop in short- and long-term interest rates last week. By late Friday, yields on 7 3/4 percent two-year notes, a good proxy of market expectations about the Fed's intentions, had fallen to 7.59 percent. Bond yields, more sensitive to longer-term economic fundamentals, stood at just over 8.6 percent late last week, down from 8.69 percent on Nov. 2.
A drop in the prime would make borrowed money more affordable for a wide range of businesses and consumers who have loans that are based on movements in the prime. But economists said that in the current climate a half-point cut would probably not noticeably increase loan demand, or the willingness of banks to lend.
"A rebuilding of household balance sheets, which shows that consumers are less willing to borrow, and tightening up on bank lending standards makes the economy less sensitive now to a drop in interest rates" than previously, said Gary Schlossberg, a vice president and senior economist at the Wells Fargo Bank in San Francisco.
 
 Need Seen for New Drops
 As far as debt-strapped corporations are concerned, long-term money market interest rates will have to fall a bit further before any benefits can be realized, said Robert A. Schwartz, an analyst at Merrill Lynch & Company. "Long rates have come down quite a bit over the last month to six weeks," he added, "and we are getting to the point where corporations are thinking not only about refinancing long-term debt but about paying down short-term debt."
Nevertheless, Mr. Schwartz said, long-term rates would need to fall "at least" another 25 basis points before major refinancings would begin.
Aside from watching the Fed, during the course of this holiday-shortened week -- the bond markets are closed today in observance of Veterans Day -- fresh economic data will probably be the primary focus for market participants.
 
 Further Evidence Expected
 Analysts expect that both the figures on retail sales, expected on Wednesday, and those on industrial production, due tomorrow, will provide further evidence that the economy weakened considerably in October. Those statistics may impress Fed governors, but analysts said a move to lower the funds rate will probably be delayed until after October consumer price data are released on Friday.
As with the October producer price report released last Friday, market particpants will probably place more importance on the "core" rate of consumer price inflation -- the rise in prices excluding food and energy -- than in the overall index.
Economists said it was unlikely that the core measure of consumer price inflation behaved as well as the core producer price index did last month.
Excluding food and energy prices, the producer price index was unchanged in October. Due to service-sector inflation, most analysts are forecasting that October consumer prices rose by about three-tenths of a percentage point, the same rate of increase recorded in September. An increase of that size should not be enough to prevent the Fed from easing policy, the economists added.

HEADLINE: Japanese Give in Grudgingly On a New Way of Shopping

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, Nov. 11

 BODY:
A few months ago the Summit supermarket and department store in Nakano, a quiet neighborhood on the west side of Tokyo, posted notices that it would stay open an hour later every evening, until 7 o'clock.
Within hours, the store was mobbed by owners of small shops, who carried protest signs and shouted accusations that Summit was being deceitful. The crowd kept up its protest until the store's management came out to negotiate. 
 "They acted without talking to us," said Michihisa Ando, who owns a small camera store a few blocks away. "That is why we got so mad."
Throughout Japan, battles over hours, floor space and other matters are beginning. They involve large stores, maverick mid-size stores like Summit and the traditional family-owned businesses that have long dominated retailing in Japan. The instigator of this turmoil is the United States.
Washington has long complained of Japanese barriers to trade, and after years of resistance, Japan agreed earlier this year to drastically weaken the power of small shopowners to keep bigger competitors out. That has radically improved the economics of opening large stores here.
 
Outcome is Unclear
 But it is not clear whether large stores, once they open, will sell many more imported goods than small shops, or whether they will help drive down the cost of consumer goods, thereby increasing consumption, the premises that underlay America's demands for change. For one thing, with a few exceptions like Toys "R" Us and Tower Records, the big retailers now rushing into previously off-limits neighborhoods are largely owned by Japanese, not Americans.
The agreement to foster competition was a important concession Japan made after Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu and President Bush, in talks in Palm Springs, Calif., last spring, broke the deadlock in trade negotiations between the countries.
The countries held negotiations with the unwieldy name of the Structural Impediments Initiative, signifying that the Governments were trying to resolve underlying conflicts in how the national cultures and economies work. In the talks, Japan agreed, among other things, to toughen its antitrust enforcement and loosen the relationships among Japanese companies that exclude outside suppliers. The United States vowed to cut its budget deficit, increase savings, and improve education in hopes of making its economy more competitive.
Without question Japan's antiquated and inefficient retailing system, in which wholesalers sometimes send a truck to deliver five boxes of detergent and the abacus still reigns supreme, is an area in which one can starkly see the results of America's endless trade talks with Japan.
Already, there are groundbreakings all over the country for shopping malls and large stores.
"I think we are beginning to prevail," a Japanese partner of Toys "R" Us said the other day, after a meeting in the Tokyo suburb of Chiba, where plans for a giant toy store were described to a sullen but largely uncomplaining group of local merchants. "I think they are coming to see the big stores as inevitable, maybe even beneficial in some neighborhoods."
Beneficial is not how Ryusuke Shinoyama, who heads the association of shopowners in Nakano, would describe the changes. "It is certain that the number of large-scale retailers will be increased," Mr. Shinoyama said at a gathering of shopowners at a sushi shop in their neighborhood. "But it is also certain that Japanese local society will be destroyed. You already see it happening."
With the supermarket and the smaller shops all staying open until 7 P.M. an uneasy truce now prevails in Nakano, whose business district, like those of most Tokyo neighborhoods, is centered on the Japan Railways station. Most shopowners are older people who rebuilt the neighborhood after it was flattened by American bombs near the end of World War II. They sweep the streets in front of their stores, and greet weary returning workers with cries of "okaeri nasai," roughly "welcome home."
And most of them play by Japanese retailing's unwritten rules: no big sales promotions that lead to price wars, no negative advertising, and limited introductions of products, which might disrupt the "orderliness" of neighborhood markets.
Then came Summit Stores Inc., a mid-size supermarket chain. It is owned by the Sumitomo Corporation, a subsidiary of the huge corporate group that includes the Sumitomo Bank and manufacturing companies.
"We knew right away that it would be big trouble, and there was opposition immediately," said Mr. Ando, who has already seen much of his camera business drawn away by big stores in Shinjuku, a giant Tokyo shopping center a few stops away on the train.
The shopkeepers took advantage of the law that American negotiators finally succeeded in modifying earlier this year: the Large-Scale Retail Store Law, which requires neighborhood approval for any store larger than 600 square yards. The 1.3 million owners of small stores form the bedrock of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party and they feared little retribution, until American complaints gave Government bureaucrats and large department stores the excuse they were waiting for.
Though Japan's complex distribution system is often blamed for the inefficiencies of the retail market here, and the resulting high prices, manufacturers themselves play a significant role. The high prices Japanese pay at home in effect subsidize the competitive prices Japanese manufacturers offer elsewhere.
Japanese consumers rarely complain about the prices they pay for Japanese-made goods. But they vote with their travel budgets. Many Japanese return from vacations and business trips with Japanese-made goods that they bought for perhaps a third less overseas.
Summit wanted to open in Nakano in 1981 or 1982, but the negotiations dragged on until 1987. To reach agreement, the company offered numerous concessions. It reduced its floor space. It agreed to close 48 days a year, rather than its original plan of 29. It agreed to shut each night at 6 P.M.
"Still, the influence was greater than we thought," said Mr. Shinoyama, the head of the Nakano shopowners' group. Within three years of Summit's opening, seven or eight nearby stores, most selling meat and vegetables, closed or rented their locations to other retailers, he added.
 
The American Goals
 Still, what remains unclear is whether all this change is achieving the goal the United States had in mind: lower prices, increased consumption and a narrowed trade gap.
Masafumi Jimbo, the manager of the Summit store, said he had made space available for imported products, like Levi's jeans. "We have definitely been told that we are to promote the sales of imports," he added, as his assistants entered stock data on a computer network. That, in turn, may force the local shopkeepers to stock imported goods as well.
The pressure to allow in imports has been so strong that efforts to slow stores like Toys "R" Us are faltering. The toy chain has announced plans to open more than 100 stores in Japan, starting with four next year. Its partner is perhaps the most successful retailer in Japan, the licensee for McDonald's restaurants, which owns prime retail sites and holds a major stake in Toys "R" Us Japan.
For a while, after owners of toy stores in Nigata Prefecture, an important farming belt, mounted repeated protests, it looked as though the toy chain faced years of negotiation. But Toys "R" Us is learning how to play the game Japanese style. It is putting most of its big stores in largely undeveloped neighborhoods, near highways and inside shopping malls -- away from local shops. It is holding community meetings to explain its plans. And it has learned how to apply political pressure.
The Japanese, ever attuned to symbolic messages, saw the future when the wife of Japan's trade minister returned from a visit to Washington not long ago laden with gifts -- all bought in a shopping spree at a Toys "R" Us store.

Othermerchants with him were, from the left; Michihisa Ando, Yojiiro Umehara, and Yuji Sanda. "But it is also certain that Japanese local society will be destroyed," he said. "You already see it happening." (David E.

KING OF MOROCCO ASKS ARAB SUMMIT

BYLINE: By JUDITH MILLER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: AMMAN, Jordan, Nov. 11

 BODY:
King Hassan II of Morocco called today for an emergency Arab summit meeting to avert a war in the Persian Gulf.
In a speech broadcast on the Moroccan radio, King Hassan, whose deployment of 1,200 troops was among the first Arab commitments to defend Saudi Arabia, warned that a conflict was drawing near and that he was willing to be the host of an Arab summit meeting within the next week "to give peace a last chance." 
 "A war between Arabs is drawing near, and the drums of war are beginning to throb," he said.
In its initial reaction to the King's call, Iraq's official press agency criticized Morocco for failing to consult with Baghdad before making its proposal. But the statement said Iraq might attend such a meeting if it was consulted about the timing, location and subjects to be discussed, and if these included discussion of the Arab-Israeli dispute.
"The proposed summit should not be part of efforts to prepare the political theater as a cover for American aggression against Iraq and the Arab nation," Baghdad declared.
 
Little Other Arab Reaction
 There was no immediate reaction from other Arab states to the Moroccan proposal. But earlier this week, President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt rejected a proposal by President Mikhail S. Gorbachev of the Soviet Union for an Arab summit meeting. In an interview, Mr. Mubarak said that the Arabs were too divided for such a session to be productive, and that supporters of Iraq were likely to try to turn it into a forum for sanctioning Baghdad's seizure of Kuwait.
The Iraqi leader, President Saddam Hussein, said today that Baghdad was ready to enter a dialogue concerning "the requirements for security in our region" provided the Palestinian question was included in the discussions.
Mr. Hussein's latest repetition of the terms under which he is ready to discuss the crisis came in an interview with the Independent Television News of Britain, which broadcast segments of the interview tonight in London. The interview took place today before King Hassan's call for an Arab summit meeting.
There was no immediate reaction from nations opposing Iraq. But the United States and other members of the coalition that have sent forces to the gulf to confront Iraq have previously rejected negotiations before a total and unconditional Iraqi withdrawal from Kuwait. They have also rejected any linkage between efforts to settle the gulf crisis and the Arab-Israeli conflict.
 
Chinese Confers in Baghdad
 In Baghdad today, Foreign Minister Qian Qichen of China held two round of talks with his Iraqi counterpart, Tariq Aziz. The Iraqi press agency said that in their second meeting, the Foreign Ministers had "exchanged views on regional conditions and ways to find a peaceful and comprehensive solution to the problems in the region." It gave no details. Mr. Qian is expected to meet with Mr. Hussein.
Iraqis have attached high priority to the Chinese visit, seeking to dissuade China from supporting any United Nations resolution that would authorize the use of force if diplomacy and economic sanctions do not persuade Iraq to quit Kuwait. As one of the five permanent members of the Security Council, China has veto power over its resolutions.
President Mubarak and American officials who met with Mr. Qian have said China would not use its veto to block such a resolution. But Chinese officials have said "detailed consultations" are needed before they would support a Security Council resolution to use force.
Before leaving Amman for Baghdad today, the Chinese Foreign Minister was quoted by Reuters as telling reporters, "I think that the armies stationed in the gulf are too many -- in a way more than necessary."
 
Tough Statement by Briton
 But Britain's Defense Secretary, Tom King, said today while en route to Saudi Arabia that Britain was considering sending additional forces to the gulf. Britain has sent close to 15,000 troops plus air support to Saudi Arabia.
Mr. King, reacting to Mr. Hussein's interview, said he saw little new in his statements. He said the Iraqi leader was "trying to divide the alliance."
In an interview with Independent Television, Mr. King added that Mr. Hussein had to withdraw from Kuwait or face war. "We are not bluffing," he said.
Iran announced today that it would hold its largest air and naval exercises in the gulf next month. Iran's naval commander, Ali Shamkani, was quoted by the Iranian press agency as saying that more than 50 ships, hundreds of small boats and helicopters would take part in the maneuvers in the Persian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman.

 BODY:
The Daily News in Los Angeles will lay off 4 percent of its workers in a cost-cutting move, its publisher, David J. Auger, said last week. The newspaper, based in the San Fernando Valley, employs about 1,200, indicating that about 48 employees will be let go. The Daily News has offered a voluntary early retirement plan to some employees, Mr. Auger said. He attributed the layoffs to the economic downturn that has hurt newspapers across the country.

A DEBATE UNFOLDS OVER GOING TO WAR AGAINST THE IRAQIS

BYLINE: By MICHAEL ORESKES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 11

 BODY:
After 14 weeks of proceeding virtually unchallenged at home, the United States policy in the Persian Gulf has become the focus of a national debate. Political and government leaders and prominent academics are examining the question of whether the country's interests in the region are worth defending in a war with Iraq.
Senator Sam Nunn of Georgia, the Democratic Party's leading spokesman on military matters, joined the other voices today in suggesting that President Bush was moving too quickly down the road to war and should be more patient to see if the United Nations-imposed sanctions would work.
 
Questions Halt to Rotation
 Mr. Nunn said the Administration had made a mistake in canceling a plan to rotate home some of the troops now in the gulf. It marked the first time a leading Democratic Party figure had directly criticized Mr. Bush's handling of the gulf situation. [Page A15.] 
 And in the last few days, voices as disparate as those of the conservative Roman Catholic Archbishop of Los Angeles, Roger Mahony, and the liberal historian Arthur Schlesinger Jr. have questioned the Bush Administration's means or its ends in the gulf crisis. The Cato Institute, a libertarian public policy research group in Washington, issued a report saying that America has no vital interest in the gulf worth going to war for, certainly not oil.
 
Democrats Are Cautious
 The Democratic leaders on Capitol Hill are proceeding cautiously. They want neither to give Mr. Bush a blank check for military action nor to appear to be undermining him in a foreign confrontation. In a joint statement, the House Speaker, Representative Thomas S. Foley, Democrat of Washington, and the majority leader, Representative Richard A. Gephardt, Democrat of Missouri, said, "We urge the President to explain fully to the American people the strategy and aims that underlie his decision to dispatch additional forces to the region."
Democratic leaders say they recognize that if American military action is to be debated before it is taken, that debate must begin soon, and certainly no later than the return of Congress in January. But at the same time, they worry that such a debate would send a message of division to Baghdad, making it appear that Democrats had undercut the essential purpose of the military buildup: to persuade the Iraqi leadership that America is united and unwavering and that the only choices are withdrawal or war.
The issue was largely avoided in the recent session of Congress and in the political campaign that ended last week. But the issue came into sharper focus as Mr. Bush embarked on a new phase of his gulf policy after the election, announcing reinforcements of the American troops in the Saudi desert to a level that will reach nearly 400,000 with the purpose of convincing President Saddam Hussein of Iraq that the United States is ready for war.
Whether he will succeed in convincing Americans as well is another matter, political and government leaders say. In and outside Washington, there are expressions of concern that Americans have not fully explored whether the human and financial costs of war in the gulf, not to mention the potential political consequences in the Middle East, are worth the hoped-for gains.
 
New Critics Emerge
 Through most of the gulf buildup, criticism of the military intervention was confined largely to what Vice President Dan Quayle referred to last week as the "isolationists" of the Republican Party.
In explaining the motives for American action, President Bush has stopped emphasizing the need to protect oil supplies, an issue he once cited along with the need to resist aggression. He now concentrates on opposing aggression, comparing Mr. Hussein to Hitler. There are critics of both rationales, and a fear of repeating the Vietnam experience -- suffering great loss of life for little purpose.
Already, political leaders in both parties have warned the White House that while Mr. Bush has a national consensus for the steps he has taken so far to defend Saudi Arabia and isolate Iraq, that may not hold for a costly offensive to drive the Iraqis from Kuwait. There is criticism from his own party on Capitol Hill that the President has done a better job of consulting with the United Nations than with the Congress and the American people.
"I think all of us who have just been out on the campaign trail are impressed that the support for the President is broad, but also very thin," said Representative Lee H. Hamilton of Indiana, a senior Democrat on the Foreign Affairs Committee. "And there's a great deal of uneasiness about all of this. They do not want American casualties. They feel that very, very strongly. No one wants American casualties."
In a letter to Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d, Archbishop Mahony, chairman of the international policy committee of the United States Catholic Conference, wrote, "Our country needs an informed and substantive discussion of the human and ethical dimensions of the policy choices under consideration."
 
Beginnings of Partisan Division
 One-third of voters surveyed on Election Day opposed American military action that would produce heavy casualties, a level of opposition reached during the Vietnam War only after several years of fighting. The survey also found the clear beginnings of the sort of partisan division that tore the country during Vietnam: two-thirds of those opposing American action in the gulf, and in particular, black Americans, voted Democratic. But more than half of those who say the nation should persevere even in the face of many casualties voted Republican.
In writing that war was simply the continuation of politics by other means, Clausewitz, the Prussian military strategist, expanded on the crucial link between the two: "Since war is not an act of senseless passion but is controlled by its political object, the value of this object must determine the sacrifices to be made for it in magnitude and also in duration. Once the expenditure of effort exceeds the value of the political object, the object must be renounced and peace must follow."
What then is the nation's political object in the gulf, and what level of sacrifice is it worth?
The Administration has given different answers to this question. Soon after the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, Mr. Bush said: "Our jobs, our way of life, our own freedom and the freedom of friendly countries around the world will suffer if control of the world's great oil reserves falls into the hands of Saddam Hussein."
 
'Fight Isn't About Oil'
 But more recently the Adminstration has abandoned -- indeed rejected -- this suggestion that the gulf confrontation is a modern day spice war, a defense of crucial economic interests. Mr. Bush returned to the image of America as the defender of freedom, the central argument in support of every other war America has fought in this century.
"The fight isn't about oil," Mr. Bush said during a pre-election campaign swing. "The fight is about naked aggression that will not stand."
"We can only presume that this line has been taken because some pollster had told the President that the public would not support sacrifice of American lives to secure Mideast oil and that he'd better start talking on a moral basis if he wanted to make hay with voters," said Ted Van Dyk, a Democratic analyst of economic and political events.
Mr. Van Dyk suggested that Mr. Bush's current rationale was inconsistent with past American policy toward Iraq.
"Fact is," he said, "Saddam Hussein has been acting like a mini-Hitler for many years. We, in fact, supported his invasion of, and war with, Iran."
"We are engaged only because of oil, as we should be," Mr. Van Dyk continued. "But to deny that self-evident fact was to further shake our partners' confidence in the President and to disturb thinking people here. You can be sure we wouldn't have a platoon on the Kuwaiti frontier if the resource in the region was guano."
 
How Much Oil, and How Vital?
 But there are conflicting views over whether Middle Eastern oil is a vital American interest. Statements that Saddam Hussein could end up controlling 40 percent of the world's oil reserves are true, but largely irrelevant, The Cato Institute argues in its report, written by Christopher Layne, a Los Angeles attorney, and Ted Galen Carpenter, the institute's director of foreign policy.
Oil reserves, they argue, are a geologist's concept, a measure of how much oil lies beneath a piece of land. "The pertinent question is how much control Iraq could gain over current world oil production," they wrote. "Even a worst-case scenario does not support the Bush Administration's panic-mongering. Iraq's conquest of Kuwait gave Baghdad control over 7 percent of global production. If Saddam were to take over Saudi Arabia, that figure would increase to only 15.7 percent."
Michael Mandelbaum, director of East-West studies at the Council on Foreign Relations and a professor at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies, argues that this is still a substantial fraction of world production. "Oil is power," he said, and it matters who holds that power, since Mr. Hussein would use it to expand his military strength and thus his influence in the region.
Mr. Schlesinger argued that the sanctions addressed this problem by cutting off Iraq's oil revenues. He and others also challenged the notion that the United States could, or should, be the deterrent to aggression throughout the third world.

'The Unknown War,' On the Korean Conflict

BYLINE: By WALTER GOODMAN

 BODY:
The cold war may be over in Europe, but the political frost is still on Korea. How that nation came to be divided, why it remains so and its prospects for reunification after almost a half century are among the matters addressed in "Korea: The Unknown War." Most of its six hours, however, are given to an eventful account of the war itself.
 The series, which begins tonight from 9 to 11 on Channels 13 and 49 and continues into tomorrow and Wednesday, has already been criticized for a revisionist tone that is unduly kind to North Korea and gives insufficient credit to American forces in the field. The writers have complained in turn that the original script has been changed under pressure from such critics. I must leave that quarrel to the specialists. To this congenitally suspicious reviewer, however, the documentary, produced by Thames Television of Britain in association with WGBH, Boston's public station, is filled with sharp and memory-jogging details and does not seem to be pushing any extreme line at the expense of the record. 
 The opener, "Many Roads to War," concentrates on the few years between Korea's liberation from Japan, its traditional enemy, after World War II and the outbreak of hostilities in 1950. It is presented as a case history of how conflicts within a small country can influence relations among great powers.
 The series is rich in newsreel clips from both North Korea, which came under Soviet occupation in 1945, and from South Korea, which was occupied by the United States, and in the recollections of players on both sides. The division at the 38th parallel, recalls Dean Rusk, who was then Assistant Secretary of State for the Far East, was arbitrary and assumed to be temporary.
 In both sectors indigenous leaders congenial to the occupying powers took over: The Communist Kim Il Sung in the North, the conservative nationalist Syngman Rhee in the South. Neither proved to be a model democrat -- though the series takes care to distinguish between the totalitarian North and the authoritarian South; both made claims to the entire country and used postwar tensions between East and West to advance their ambitions.
Military feints came regularly from both sides of the 38th parallel. The withdrawal of American military forces from the South in June 1949, followed by a speech by Secretary of State Dean Acheson that was interpreted as placing Korea out of America's "defense perimeter" in the Pacific may have been taken as an invitation to invasion by the heavily armed North. The comments of former American and Soviet officers and diplomats suggest that the superpowers, whose concerns were mainly centered on Europe, would have been content to leave their bellicose Asian clients to their own devices, but were too deeply entangled to walk away.
Both sides said they were taken by surprise. Whoever started it, this became the first war to be fought by the United Nations, then pro-West, under the leadership of the United States. In a revealing interview, a Soviet official tells of his surprise that his country's U.N. delegation, which had been boycotting the Security Council over its refusal to admit China, did not return to block the U.N. action. He calls it a "stupid error."
The series relies, on camera and off, on Bruce Cumings, a professor of history at the University of Chicago, as its major consultant. Tonight's two-part program ends with the Communist victories, including the fall of Seoul, in the early weeks of the war, preparing the way for Gen. Douglas MacArthur's spectacular landing at Inchon in September 1950.
Veterans from both sides are heard tomorrow and Wednesday in an account of the crossing of the 38th parallel by the U.N. forces, which prompted a powerful counterattack by Chinese "volunteers." Also covered are President Harry S. Truman's dismissal of MacArthur for going public with his proposal to attack mainland China; the brainwashing of American prisoners of war, and the charges, orchestrated by the world political left, that the United States was using germ warfare. (No definitive conclusion is offered on the accuracy of those charges.) The final program deals largely with the truce of 1953. By this account the deadlock at the prolonged negotiations was broken by President Dwight D. Eisenhower's leaked threat to use the atomic bomb.
The end of the war left Korea as divided as it was at the start. In the years since, of course, South Korea has become an economic wonder, whose relations with the North are still far from warm. Viewers with a memory of television's treatment of the Vietnam War may find themselves wondering how matters might have turned out if Americans at home had been a nightly audience to scenes from the bitter battlefield of Korea.

HEADLINE: Review/Opera;
Ravel and Sendak, Affectionately Paired

BYLINE: By JOHN ROCKWELL

 BODY:
The double bill of Maurice Ravel's entire operatic output -- the witty "Heure Espagnol" of 1907 and the enchanting "Enfant et les Sortileges" of 1924, each about 50 minutes long -- finally made it on Saturday to the New York City Opera, where it will run with alternating casts through Sunday afternoon.
Directed by Frank Corsaro and designed by Maurice Sendak, the children's book illustrator, this production was first seen at the Glyndebourne Festival Opera in England in 1987 and 1988. The sets and costumes were purchased by the City Opera and intended for last fall. A labor dispute forced the company to cancel its 1989 fall season and postpone this production until now. 
 What finally arrived onstage at the New York State Theater on Saturday, with one cast in the afternoon and the other in the evening, has its distinct charms, both as a production concept and as performance. It is an honorable, affectionate look at Ravel. But it cannot be said that the more ambitious of the productions, of "L'Enfant et les Sortileges," comes close to New York's closest standard of comparison, the Metropolitan Opera's version of a decade ago, with David Hockney's visionary decor.
The problem in both operas lies more with Mr. Sendak than Mr. Corsaro, who handles stage action deftly apart from his lingering predilection for extraneous mime figures and bits of business. Mr. Sendak's book illustrations, surely familiar to most people, involve large, cartoonlike creatures and a muted color palette. Translated to the stage, in this and his other operatic designs, the same techniques look blunt and unevocative -- cute, often, but remiss in illusionist mystery.
"L'Heure Espagnol," a sexy comedy involving a clockmaker in Toledo, Spain, his rambunctious wife, two aspiring but silly lovers and a brawny muleteer, was placed in a cheerful but oddly dingy setting, with none of the vibrant colors, strong contrasts and visual elegance implied by the Spanish setting and Ravel's music.
It was odd, too, that Mr. Corsaro chose to make the clockmaker, who is referred to as a "ridiculous husband" in the final ensemble, into a benign overseer of the action, with all the characters his mechanical confections. Nothing in the libretto by Maurice Le Grant, who wrote under the name Franc-Nohain, suggests such an inflation of stature.
"L'Enfant et les Sortileges," Colette's fable of a naughty child who is punished when furniture, toys, animals and plants come to life to chastise him, was presented in an ingenious combination of film, slides, sets and animated props. Here Mr. Sendak's childlike cartoons worked more appropriately, if without Mr. Hockney's glowing magic.
But there were technical problems. Ronald Chase's film jiggled continuously, calling attention to itself; perhaps in Glyndebourne's far smaller theater, this problem was less severe. Sometimes the film effects were delightful, as in dancing fire and the manic numbers accompanying the torments of Arithmetic. But too often, even with a covered orchestra pit, they further diluted the colors; even the sparkling stars and comets at the end looked fuzzy and dim.
Still, there is plenty left to enjoy in the operas themselves, these productions and the musical performances, and Cori Ellison's sure supertitles contribute to the audience's pleasure.
For the comparison shopper, the Saturday evening cast, with Anna Steiger as the flirtatious wife in "L'Heure Espagnol," is preferable to the matinee cast. But those who have already bought tickets for the afternoon cast need not feel cheated. Its principals are all good and sometimes better; there is plenty of overlapping in the many small roles in "L'Enfant," and the refined orchestral playing and idiomatic conducting of Guido Ajmone-Marsan are common to both casts.
Miss Steiger, the daughter of Rod Steiger and Claire Bloom, had sung Concepcion at Glyndebourne and was making her City Opera debut. She brought a fuller, sweeter, more easily produced soprano to the part than Kathryn Gamberoni, and an earthier wit to her acting. The evening cast also offered the richly comic Don Inigo Gomez of Joseph McKee, funnier and better sung than that of Jan Opalach.
Kevin Anderson and Michael Rees Davis were about equal as Gonzalve, the impossibly poetical poet. And while Jonathan Green as the clockmaker (a surer singer than John Lankston) and Robert Orth as the muleteer (more macho-looking than Richard Byrne) in the afternoon were better, and while the afternoon cast seemed slightly more at ease with the French, the balance was still tipped decisively toward the evening.
In "L'Enfant et les Sortileges," the evening cast was again superior, though not so markedly. Julia Parks was a shorter (and hence more believably boyish) Child than Robin Tabachnik; Michele McBride sang more dulcetly as the Princess than Young Ok Shin, Mr. Roth and Byrne were about equal in their triple roles, and Lisa Saffer, with her crystalline coloratura, made a more striking Fire and Nightingale than Virginia Sublett.

HEADLINE: After Rape Charge, 2 Lives Hurt and 1 Destroyed

BYLINE: By WILLIAM CELIS 3d, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SOUTH KINGSTON, R.I., Nov. 11

 BODY:
A University of Rhode Island fraternity held a time-honored college rite two weeks ago: a Saturday night bash at the fraternity house with plenty of beer and a throng of young women.
But what happened at the Tau Kappa Epsilon house the night of Oct. 27 and in the following days has rocked this sedate campus of 10,000 students. An 18-year-old freshman told the police that a man raped her at the party while at least five other men watched. 
 On Oct. 31, Dave Lallemand, 19, was arrested and charged with rape. Held for a week without bail, he was released Wednesday when the woman testified at a bail hearing that she was not certain that Mr. Lallemand had assaulted her because she had been drinking heavily the day of the party.
Even as the woman testified, 20-year-old Michael Lindell lay dying in a nearby hospital after shooting himself in the head at his family's home in Pawtucket hours before he was scheduled to meet with the state police to discuss what he saw that night in the fraternity house. The former University of Rhode Island student, who had attended previous parties at the fraternity house, died Wednesday night.
 
Sympathy for 'Three Victims'
 "There really are three victims, and I feel sorry for them all," said Sandra Wall, a student from Pawtucket who went to high school with Mr. Lindell.
Investigators have declined to say whether they see a link between the incident and the suicide of Mr. Lindell, who Miss Wall said had personal problems. Mr. Lindell is believed by the authorities to have been one of the five in the room at the time of the incident.
The twists and turns of the case have been played out against rising reports of sex crimes on campuses across the country. Earlier this year, for example, six students at St. John's University in New York, including five members of the lacrosse team, were accused of sexually assaulting a female student.
Although no definitive statistics on campus rape exist, anecdotal evidence suggests that it is occurring more often these days, partly because universities are doing a better job of compiling data and because women are coming forward more often to press charges.
 
More Relaxed Rules
 Some university officials here believe that more relaxed rules on campuses have made sexual assaults more common. Those changes in rules helped create dormitories shared by both sexes, prompted the lifting of curfews and resulted in looser drinking practices, all of which have played significant roles in campus sexual assaults. Few schools seem immune to the problem, university officials said in interviews last week. The University of Rhode Island, despite its quiet setting, is no exception.
The Tau Kappa Epsilon party began on a crisp Saturday evening in the fraternity's sprawling three-story, 18-bedroom home, with a spacious living room and a large-screen television set.
The woman arrived about 9:30 P.M. with another woman after drinking earlier in the day, according to a statement she gave the police.
The woman, who lives in a university dormitory and returned to campus late last week after going to her parents' home in Massachusetts, could not be reached for comment. But in her statement to the police, she said she went upstairs because she became bored with the party downstairs. Once she arrived in a third-floor bedroom, she told the police, a man she would later identify as Mr. Lallemand, who is 6 feet 7 inches tall, began pawing her. She said that when she tried to push him away he forced himself on her.
 
Student Is Defended
 She told the police that two or three other men who were present tried to prevent her from dressing after the assault. She said another man whom she did not know picked her up, put her over his shoulder and carried her to her dormitory.
The incident shocked students and prompted about 200 women to stage a vigil last week demanding more safety measures. The incident also elicited a defense of the young woman, despite questions raised publicly by some students about her judgment.
Some said the real victim was Mr. Lallemand, a first-year student who is trying to join the fraternity. Neither he nor his family could be reached for comment, but the student maintained his innocence in published comments after his release.
 
Bad Feelings Remain
 Taillights on the cars of some fraternity members have been smashed and the word "rapist" scrawled in lipstick on their car windows. Other members have been shunned by the university community. In a move that especially hurt the fraternity, the organization was banned from holding social functions until state and university investigations are complete. "There are questions still hanging in the air," said Michael P. Brady, the fraternity's president and a senior economics major from Albany. "We don't know what happened, but I can say that Dave is 100 percent innocent."
Mr. Lallemand is one of 21 underclassmen trying to join the fraternity in the pledging process, which requires the student to wear a fraternity pin and perform services for members. The woman told the police that her assailant wore a pledge pin. While viewing 21 photographs of the pledges, she identified her assailant as Mr. Lallemand, who she said had introduced himself as "Dan."
The case unraveled Wednesday, when the woman testified that she could no longer say with certainty that Mr. Lallemand had assaulted her. She testified that she went blank for a time and that she remembered waking up on a couch before a man whom she did not know carried her back to her dormitory.
In investigating the incident, the second reported sexual-assault case on the campus this fall, the state police began interviewing five or six other men believed to have been in the room when the attack occurred. One of them was Mr. Lindell, who attended the university last year but had since left the school. The former high school football player had attended several fraternity parties because of hometown ties with at least one fraternity member, said friends of Mr. Lindell.
 
Was Not a Suspect
 Last Tuesday, hours before he was to have been questioned by the police, Mr. Lindell used a gun belonging to his roommate and shot himself. Lieut. Brian R. Andrews, chief of the Rhode Island state police's detective unit, said Mr. Lindell was not a suspect. But he said the turn of events will make the case more difficult to solve because of discrepancies in the accounts given to the police by 18 people who were at the fraternity house.
The state police are to confer with the State Attorney General's office on Wednesday, when a decision is expected to be made to refer the case to a grand jury, Lieutenant Andrews said.
The incident occurred even as university officials have tried to exert more control over student life. Freshman are warned during orientation about campus rape. University officials, noting that 70 to 80 percent of disciplinary problems are alcohol-related, said the incident may prod efforts to create an alcohol-free campus.
