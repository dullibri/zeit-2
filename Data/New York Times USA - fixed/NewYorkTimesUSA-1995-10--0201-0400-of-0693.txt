HEADLINE: The Greening of U.S. Diplomacy: Focus on Ecology

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 8

 BODY:
Environmental threats like the beautiful water hyacinths choking Lake Victoria and the desert sands eating away the sparse pastures bordering the Sahara are some of the issues deemed urgent today by American foreign policy makers in much the same manner as military threats like new surface-to-air missile sites alarmed policy makers several decades ago.
These days, intelligence officials are being asked to look at softer targets -- those flowers and sand dunes -- to shed light on this decade's hot wars. Through this optic, Somalia and Rwanda can be interpreted not as spontaneous outbreaks of clan warfare or ethnic violence, but as conflicts nourished by the underlying strains of hunger, drought and a lack of arable land in Somalia, and huge population growth and population density in Rwanda. 
 So in addition to their traditional intelligence gathering -- arms, nuclear weapons programs, expansion of foreign armies -- American policy makers are looking more than ever before at natural phenomena in their search for the deeper roots of war and threats to global security. They are expecting more wars like Somalia, where the United States sent troops to calm a desperate situation spawned by environmental calamities and the brutal political response to it. To prepare for such future wars, they are analyzing subjects like the water table levels in Central Asia and the water hyacinths in Central Africa.
In August, the Defense Intelligence Agency finished a study on the rapid spread of the water hyacinth plant in Lake Victoria, which provides 120,000 tons of fish each year to Uganda, Kenya and Tanzania. The agency noted with due seriousness how a single water hyacinth can multiply into a million plants in one year and, the report warned, these plants could ultimately strangle the lake and kill most of its fish. The consequences would be serious: famine and such political instability in neighboring countries that the United States could be called in to help.
In looking at the underlying causes of war and crisis, the intelligence community now examines an expanded menu of subjects, including agriculture, demographics, economics and epidemiology. It looks, for instance, at China's economic boom and how it is causing considerable overcrowding in China's cities; at the AIDS epidemic in East Africa and how it is affecting the region's military and political elites; and at Mexico's industrial leap forward and how it has left millions of peasants behind.
Some old-line intelligence officials disparage this new focus on what they call "soft stuff." But the Clinton Administration, led by Vice President Al Gore, has deliberately added this new focus on environmental and natural factors -- famine, soil erosion, rapid population growth, the expansion of deserts -- that they believe will produce many of the world crises of tomorrow.
"During the cold war, most security threats stemmed from state-to-state aggression, so most of the analysis was of factors that could produce state-to-state aggression," said James Steinberg, the State Department's director of policy planning. "Now we're focusing more on internal factors that can destabilize governments and lead to civil wars and ethnic strife. Now we're paying much more attention to early warning factors, like famine and the environment."
The United States looks less than before at who is sitting where in the Kremlin and more at how good this fall's harvest will be in the Central Asian republics.
The Central Intelligence Agency recently commissioned a study to determine whether there was a correlation between a country's infant mortality rate, the openness of a country's trading system to imports and the stability of its government, hoping that finding a way to view these factors collectively would help the C.I.A. predict where the next crisis might erupt.
Gathering of the so-called soft intelligence has become routine. The C.I.A. now does an annual study, called "Global Humanitarian Emergencies" that forecasts which countries are most likely to suffer from natural disasters. It set up a global affairs department two years ago that analyzes environmental matters, the global food situation and other issues the agency once gave little attention.
"We've been looking at some of these softer issues for a long time," said one intelligence official. "What's different now is these issues have moved from the periphery to take a more central role."
Angelo Codevilla, an intelligence expert who teaches at Boston University, said this new approach is misguided. "All this soft stuff is a silly idea," he said. "The purpose of intelligence is to ferret out secrets from people who want to keep those secrets. To turn intelligence into environmental reports is not to understand environmental problems or intelligence."
Professor Codevilla said it was wrong to switch from harder to softer intelligence. "The hard stuff is as important as ever because guns will determine the future of the world as much as they ever did," he said.
Toby Gati, Assistant Secretary of State for Intelligence, disagrees, saying, "This soft stuff immediately becomes hard when you have to send in the Marines."
George Moose, the Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs, is a promoter of this new approach and says that if the intelligence community had studied Somalia's water table levels in the three years before the outbreak of famine and clan warfare there, the information might have warned diplomats of an imminent crisis. Since Africa is his responsibility, Mr. Moose is particularly sensitive to the role of natural disasters in human conflicts. He argues that the rapid spread of the Sahara desert set off the 1989 conflict between Senegal and Mauritania, when herdsmen from the two countries went to war over a dwindling amount of grazing land.
In recent years the Pentagon has sent troops to Somalia, where American soldiers made it safe for relief groups to deliver food to starving people, and to Zaire, where the United States set up emergency camps for Rwandan refugees. Even in the more traditional Haiti operation, American troops were called upon to restore an ousted, democratically elected president who vowed to combat poverty rather than to take up arms in a classic government-to-government confrontation like the wars in Korean and Vietnam.
The Administration says the American people care about the problems addressed recently. "The issues of overpopulation, of refugees, of famine, of human rights problems are issues the American people have become more interested in," said one National Security Council official.
This shift toward softer intelligence has brought with it another shift: more than ever before, the intelligence community is using public material, particularly relief reports produced by organizations like the International Committee of the Red Cross.
In Africa, where the the C.I.A. is cutting back its presence, intelligence officials acknowledge that the thousands of relief workers there are a trove of information about the continent. To take advantage of this, the Clinton Administration is setting up a computer information network, called "Relief Net," to speed the flow of information from the Red Cross and other relief groups to Government agencies.

HEADLINE: White House Skirts Moynihan Proposal

BYLINE: By The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 8

 BODY:
White House Chief of Staff Leon Panetta expressed wariness today about proposals by some Democrats and Republicans in Congress to ease the budget crunch by changing the formula the Federal Government uses to measure the cost of living.
Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, the New York Democrat who is the ranking minority member of the Finance Committee, wants to reduce the Consumer Price Index by one percentage point a year. A panel of economists commissioned by the Finance Committee concluded last month that the index overstated the true level of inflation. 
 Since the index is used to fix the level of many Federal expenses, including Social Security payments, an overstatement of one percentage point, which the economists call the most plausible figure, would cost the Government $600 billion over the next 10 years, the panel said.
On the NBC's "Meet the Press," Mr. Panetta was cautious about Mr. Moynihan's proposal.
"It should not be a deal in which everybody looks into the budget and says, 'Oh, my God, we're $50 billion to $60 billion short. Let's throw the C.P.I. into that mix in order to make up the difference," he said.
Appearing later on the same program, Senator Moynihan expressed frustration at the White House's reluctance to support the idea.
"They're scared of what the American Association of Retired Persons will say and others will say," he said.

HEADLINE: Nafta Trade-Off: Some Jobs Lost, Others Gained

BYLINE: By JAMES STERNGOLD 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Oct. 6

 BODY:
Twenty-one months after the North American Free Trade Agreement took effect with ebullient projections that it would create hundreds of thousands of jobs, the experience of the Key Tronic Corporation, a big manufacturer of computer keyboards in Spokane, Wash., is a reason some critics argue the trade pact has cost the United States dearly.
Key Tronic, which faces stiff competition from Japanese manufacturers, has laid off 277 workers and moved their jobs to a plant in Ciudad Juarez, Mexico, where wages are a fourth of those in Washington. In fact, tens of thousands of factory jobs in this country have been lost since the agreement took effect for precisely the same reason. 
 But as it happens, Key Tronic is also an example of the benefits created by the trade pact. Ronald F. Klawitter, the company's chief financial officer, said that Key Tronic's sales had jumped because of the lower costs of manufacturing in Mexico, which enabled the company to lower prices and win new orders. And since many of the components used in the keyboards assembled in Ciudad Juarez come from plants near Spokane, overall employment in the area has actually increased to keep up with the demand.
"Some of the business we've picked up we wouldn't have gotten if we didn't have the Mexican plant," said Mr. Klawitter, who added that without Nafta the company might have had to consider manufacturing in low-wage Asian countries.
Mexico's President, Ernesto Zedillo, is coming to Washington on Tuesday, and Nafta will weigh heavily on both his talks with President Clinton, and how critics will assess the relationship between the countries. When the pact was passed by Congress in November 1993, Mr. Clinton called the agreement "a defining moment for our nation" and his economists said it would create 170,000 jobs in the first year. Clearly that has not been the case, because of the deep Mexican recession. But many businessmen and economists say jobs were the wrong way to measure Nafta's effects; as in the case of Key Tronic and many other companies, Nafta is all about corporate efficiency.
Even within Mexico there is some disappointment with Nafta because of its perceived failure to create jobs and the fact that last December's peso crisis created a deep recession that for the time being has outweighed any potential benefits.
On the political level, much of the debate in the United States has involved hyperbole and oversimplification. Conservatives like Pat Buchanan, a Republican Presidential hopeful, and labor unions have found common purpose in calling for Nafta's repeal. Backers say it is just a matter of time before benefits begin to outweigh short-term job losses.
Perhaps more important, the peso crisis, which caused the Mexican currency to plummet by nearly 50 percent and sent the economy into a paralyzing recession, has made it even more difficult to assess just how the lowering of tariffs and other barriers under Nafta has affected American companies and workers. Clearly, economists say, some job losses in this country are a result of the steep drop in demand in Mexico for goods of all kinds, not Nafta.
But as the Key Tronic example demonstrates, Nafta has not been a zero-sum game, where one country's gains translate into the other country's losses. The Nafta experience has borne out the fact that the effects of trade involve a powerful dynamic in which many forces push and pull to reshape the economic structure of both countries, and that those changes are not without much pain.
For instance, one of the big pluses for the Chrysler Corporation is not just the potential increase in the sale of its cars and trucks in Mexico -- sales are down considerably this year because of the recession, after a huge jump in sales last year -- but the fact that it can now sharply increase the efficiency of its Mexican plants.
James D. Donlon, a Chrysler vice president, said one Mexican plant previously produced several models in relatively small numbers, largely for sale in what was then a protected Mexican market that was highly resistant to imports from the United States. Now, with many of those barriers being phased out, that plant will produce just one model, in far greater numbers and thus at less cost per vehicle, in a few years. And those autos will be sold both domestically and in the United States. In addition, Chrysler will be able to export autos from the United States to Mexico, making a wider range of vehicles available to Mexican consumers.
"Our ability to integrate our marketing and our production represents a total operation well beyond what the two could have been separately," Mr. Donlon said. "But we won't see the full benefit for two or three years."
Then there are workers like Manuel Lepe. Mr. Lepe, a mechanic who works on apparel-cutting machines, lost his job last year at a Los Angeles factory after 20 years with the company.
The blow was softened by the fact that the company helped Mr. Lepe find a new job with another apparel contractor. But there was one problem: his new job came with a pay cut to $6.25 an hour from $8.50.
And consider what has happened to California farmers. Exports to Mexico of many agricultural products, like lettuce and peaches, have risen since Nafta lowered tariffs on many of those commodities.
"It turned out that it was cheaper to produce lettuce here using Mexican labor than in Mexico," said Philip L. Martin, an agricultural economist at the University of California at Davis.
"But the perverse effect of that is that it has increased the demand here for Mexican workers," who are willing to do this tough, low-wage work, Mr. Martin added. "We're still sucking in workers to export these commodities."
That, of course, contradicts the Clinton Administration's claims that Nafta would reduce the floodtide of illegal immigrants by creating more opportunities in Mexico. It also counters the argument of Ross Perot that jobs would flow one-way under Nafta -- to Mexico -- creating "a giant sucking sound."
"We reject that," said Mr. Donlon of Chrysler. "We firmly believe that there will be more total jobs and more jobs in the U.S. It is hard for me to put my finger on and prove because of the peso crisis and what that has done to our business. But if you look at what has happened with Canada, there's one heck of a lot more commerce on both sides of the border."
Other businessmen say that many low-wage jobs will inevitably migrate overseas, but that now some will move to Mexico rather than East Asia.
"The great sucking sound is not the sucking of our jobs to Mexico, it is the sucking of jobs from the Orient," said Robert Paltrow, president of N. A. Communications, a marketing concern based in Armonk, N.Y.
His company has built a plant in Tijuana that assembles one million direct mailing packets a day and that also has a section doing high-tech sewing. The plant has 400 employees after 7 months of operation.
Mr. Paltrow said that with wages roughly one-seventh the level in the United States, "Tijuana and Baja are going to become monstrously large sewing centers," and that will fuel expansion in the United States, where design and other knowledge-intensive operations take place.
Jagdish Bhagwati, an economics professor at Columbia University and a strong proponent of free trade, said that the Nafta experience had left him with some reservations. He said Nafta does appear to be putting downward pressure on American wages and is causing some net reduction in jobs without providing sufficient help for displaced workers.
The Department of Labor, in fact, has documented the loss of 42,221 jobs because of Nafta as of Sept. 30. But that is regarded as a low count since it includes only those workers who have applied and qualified for a Government program to assist them in job training and in finding new jobs.
There are also complaints that Mexico is dragging its feet in carrying out some of the pact's provisions. For instance, the United Parcel Service has said that before Nafta it was able to use only small, inefficient vans to move packages in Mexico, because the Government would not grant it the permits to use the big trucks that its Mexican competitors freely used.
Nafta was supposed to have changed that immediately, but U.P.S. says the Mexican Government has refused to grant it the permits. So it has filed the first complaint under a procedure Nafta set up for resolving such disputes.
Nevertheless, U.P.S. said it still backs Nafta and believes that in the long run it will benefit both countries. It also says that for every increase of 70 packages that it moves to and from Mexico, one job is created in the United States.
"The main point was not that tariffs were lowered under Nafta; they were already pretty low," said Edward Leamers, a professor at Yale and the University of California at Los Angeles. "More important was that Nafta guarantees the tariffs won't suddenly be raised. It is a major risk reduction document for investors."
"If your time clock is year by year, then Nafta was definitely oversold," Mr. Leamers added. "If your clock runs decade by decade, this is a more important event."

HEADLINE: For Mexico, Nafta's Promise Of Jobs Is Still Just a Promise

BYLINE: By ANTHONY DePALMA 

DATELINE: MONTERREY, Mexico, Oct. 7

 BODY:
So many people expected this brawny city of steel and glass to become a showcase of free trade and open competition after the three nations of North America signed a trade pact in 1993 that Monterrey officials put up an eight-foot monument to the agreement called "A Hope for Development."
The North American Free Trade Agreement, or Nafta, was supposed to reach its full potential here, creating more jobs, more prosperity, more hope that Mexico's future would be bright enough to keep struggling Mexicans from illegally crossing the border. 
 Besides an artistically questionable monument on the main highway into town, however, what Monterrey's million residents got during the last two years is typical of what Mexico has gotten since joining Nafta: unfulfilled promises.
Few Mexicans have lost sight of Nafta's basic accomplishment: permanently linking Mexico's struggling economy to the world's largest consumer market, the United States. That alone has made Mexico the envy of Chile and most of the other countries of the hemisphere lining up to join Nafta.
Still, the long-range promise of the agreement has not alleviated unemployment in Monterrey, which approaches 10 percent and is consistently the highest in Mexico, and the $3-a-day minimum wage buys less than ever before. Retail sales have plummeted.
"I thought that after Nafta there would be more jobs, and a greater flow of information and goods," said Marcela Acosta, a 22-year-old from Monterrey who was recently seeking her first permanent job since graduating with a degree in international commerce from a Mexican university last December. "I thought that was the future."
Hundreds of businesses in Monterrey have closed, with few new ones opening. And some American demographers say the number of illegal emigrants streaming north out of Mexico may have actually increased in recent months.
But Monterrey is not complaining too loudly. When President Ernesto Zedillo meets with President Clinton in Washington on Tuesday to discuss Nafta and other economic issues, few Mexicans plan to protest against the trade pact.
Most businessmen here recognize that Monterrey's misery is caused more by Mexico's current recession than by Nafta. The trade pact has helped some people here do quite well. The Vitro glass company, Cemex, a cement maker, Grupo Alfa, which makes steel among other items, and a handful of other big Monterrey companies have sharply increased exports.
"Many people say the cause of the crisis is Nafta," said Hiram Peon, a spokesman for Vitro, which increased exports of flat glass and drinking glasses almost 30 percent this year, but without adding any jobs. "But when the markets recover, all the infrastructure and trade contacts are going to give us the chance to sell our products and take advantage of the North American market."
Nafta did not make the border between the United States and Mexico disappear. Trucks still back up in mile-long lines at the border.
But Nafta is the guarantee that Mexico is committed to the kind of no-holds-barred economy that Washington has long tried to get it to adopt. Perhaps more than anything, Nafta, and the years of trade liberalization it capped, have increased United States influence in Mexico.
The combination of Nafta's passage and the economic crisis have pushed Mexico to accelerate the sale of Government-owned railroads, airports and the oil monopoly Pemex. Mexico has also liberalized its foreign investment law so that United States companies are now major players in banking, telecommunications and almost every part of the economy, bringing in direct investment capital that Mexico, after devaluation of the peso, sorely needs.
President Clinton has been criticized because Nafta and the devalued peso have combined to tip the trade balance in Mexico's favor. By the end of July, Mexico had sold the United States almost $9 billion more in merchandise than it had imported. Mexican exports of cars, winter tomatoes, frozen strawberries and many other products are up sharply, and this year Mexico will record its first trade surplus with the United States since 1990.
Mexico's trade advantage has irritated opponents of Nafta in the United States, even though Mexico has often sold more to the United States than it bought. American surpluses from 1991 through 1994 were the only ones since 1981. Before that, Mexico's economy was so restricted that trade between the two nations was largely limited to Mexican oil and American machines.
Opponents of Nafta, led by organizations like Public Citizen and by politicians like Patrick J. Buchanan, have recently accused the Mexicans of reneging on the deal. They say the peso devaluation, combined with Mexico's low wages and the lowering of tariffs by Nafta, gives Mexican products an overwhelming advantage over American goods.
Such criticism is not surprising considering that Nafta represents the first time that fully developed economies, like those of the United States and Canada, agreed to throw down trade barriers with a low-wage developing country like Mexico. Under Nafta, tariffs on most goods dropped substantially when the pact took effect on Jan. 1, 1994, and will be phased out completely over 15 years.
Despite a rebellion in the southern state of Chiapas that started on the day Nafta took effect, the deal worked pretty much as it was supposed to during most of 1994. Mexican exports to the United States increased, but so did American exports to Mexico. Then the economy collapsed last December.
Most economists say Nafta had little or nothing to do with the crisis. But they agree that the current Mexican economy should be seen as the outcome of a decadelong process of tearing down barriers that began with Mexico's application to join the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trades, or GATT, in 1986. Tariffs dropped from as high as 100 percent to 20 percent or less. Nafta brought the tariffs on most goods down to zero or slightly above.
That was supposed to have given American producers and retailers a market of 90 million prosperous Mexicans, but so far it has remained just a marketer's dream.
Expectations seem to be on hold at the huge new Wal-Mart on the outskirts of Monterrey, just west of the Nafta monument. On a recent Sunday, only half of the 44 cash registers were operating. When the store opened in June 1994, its shelves were packed with Dustbusters and other American products.
Now, store managers say, higher import prices caused by the devaluation have forced them to cut back American goods to only 20 percent of stock. The Dustbusters are still there, but most other items come from Mexico.
That is not what President Clinton had in mind when he promised that Nafta would create 200,000 new American jobs by this year. Nor does it coincide with the 600,000 new Mexican jobs that some economists had predicted for Mexico in 1995.
The United States Labor Department reports that because of Nafta, 41,201 American manufacturing jobs have been lost since January 1994. But America's loss was not always Mexico's gain; the latest Mexican Government figures indicate that a million Mexicans have been put out of work this year alone, continuing a trend. Manufacturing employment has dropped every month since September 1990.
So far this year, 1,664 businesses in Monterrey have closed while only 346 new ones opened, the chamber of commerce says. Retail sales have plummeted to half their 1994 level.
It's not that Nafta has not given Monterrey anything to smile about.
Last month the Blue Bird Corporation, an American company, opened a plant that is building buses in Monterrey for sale in Mexico and export to Central and South America.
And the Mexican construction company ICA, Northern Telecom of Canada and Fluor Daniel of the United States have joined in a new venture to build more than 2,500 miles of fiber optic network for MCI Communications Corporation and the Mexican bank Banamex.
Although President Clinton twisted Mexican arms on wages, labor rights and the environment, the accords have not done much to improve conditions in those areas.
Mexican minimum wages are now indexed to increases in productivity, as the Mexicans promised, but inflation has eaten away any real improvements.
Mr. Clinton told a skeptical Congress that by creating jobs, Nafta could reduce the number of illegal emigrants who cross the border.
Then after the disastrous peso devaluation last December, the administration warned that unless Washington helped Mexico with a multi-billion-dollar bailout, a half million new illegal immigrants would flood into the United States.
How many Mexicans have crossed the border in recent months is hotly debated. But no one on either side of the border claims any more that Nafta has slowed immigration by invigorating Mexico's economy, as the treaty's backers promised.
The net gain for Monterrey and Mexico after Nafta is not anywhere near what either expected. But in a city that is about to mark its 400th anniversary, many Mexicans, like Flavio Ortega, a 35-year-old former computer technician who now shines shoes outside the Howard Johnson Hotel here, have learned the value of patience.
"I really didn't expect much to happen in two years," he said. "I thought it would take more like five years.
"But if it's true we've hit bottom in the crisis, and we don't know if what they tell us is the truth or a lie, three years will still be enough time to recover."

Japan Knew of Daiwa Loss Weeks Before U.S. Officials
The Japanese Government knew of a huge loss by a rogue trader at Daiwa Bank six weeks before American regulators were told of the $1.1 billion scandal. American officials are privately outraged by Japan's failure to disclose the scandal, which led to the resignations of top officials of Daiwa Bank. The issue of notification is just one aspect of the incident under investigation.
The disclosure raised questions about why Japan's Ministry of Finance kept Washington in the dark for so long. [Page A1.]
 
Stocks Tumble; Dow Loses 42.99
The stock market stum bled badly, pulled down by a broad retreat in technology stocks and growing concerns about corporate profits. The Dow industrials, which at one point dropped as much as 57.47 points, closed at 4,726.22, down 42.99 points, or nearly 1 percent. The Nasdaq composite index fell 27.30 points, or 2.7 percent, to 984.74. [D14.]

HEADLINE: 5 Million Strike in France to Protest Pay Freeze

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: PARIS, Oct. 9

 BODY:
France and its conservative Government braced for chaos as more than five million public-sector workers began a general walkout tonight to fight a pay freeze.
From trains, subways, telephones and air travel to buses, mail, schools, hospitals and weather forecasts, France's vital functions are expected to be reduced or suspended completely for more than a day. 
 The strike is the first major labor challenge to the conservative Prime Minister, Alain Juppe, who came to power in May with promises to cut France's huge deficit as well as 11.5 percent unemployment. He is grappling with a public sector that accounts for half the nation's productivity.
The Government says nearly 40 percent of its deficit-ridden budget goes into public sector employee paychecks. Unions counter that they are being made scapegoats for France's economic crisis.
The Organization for Economic Development and Cooperation says state workers in France made up 25 percent of the work force in 1993, compared with 14.5 percent in the United States, 16.9 percent in Britain and 14.9 percent in Germany.
Mr. Juppe also is under fire for his role in a housing scandal. His office has denied persistent rumors that his resignation is imminent.
The walkout began when the nation's train system shut down at 8 P.M. Workers said it would not resume until 6 A.M. Wednesday. Paris train stations were eerily empty as the last travelers straggled away.
Unions planned demonstrations for Tuesday, and their leaders threatened more strikes, demonstrations and work slowdowns unless the Government backs down.
It is the first time that all seven Government service unions have united to strike since 1986, when Jacques Chirac, now France's President but then its Prime Minister, froze wages.
The French railway company said most international trains scheduled to leave Paris on Tuesday would be canceled, as would 75 percent of domestic trains.
The Government said the police would not issue parking tickets or read parking meters on Tuesday, to help people forced by the bus and subway shutdown to drive to work.
France's Civil Service Minister, Jean Puech, said today that the Government would hold new salary talks with public sector unions in the second quarter of next year. He criticized the strike for upsetting citizens' lives.
But a recent public opinion poll published by the newspaper Le Figaro indicated that the French are divided on the issue: 47 percent approved of the strike and 48 percent opposed it.
The franc and the French stock market have fallen since Mr. Juppe pressured Finance Minister Alain Madelin to resign in August after he urged cuts in civil service jobs.

HEADLINE: Technology Stocks Lead Market Dive

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE M. FISHER 

 BODY:
Technology stocks fell sharply yesterday in a broad retreat that many analysts interpreted as the beginning of the long-awaited selloff in this high-flying group.
The dive in technology stocks dragged the Nasdaq composite index down 27.30 points, or 2.7 percent, to close at 984.74. The negative sentiment also spilled over into blue-chip stocks, with the Dow Jones industrial average falling 42.99 points, to 4,726.22. [Page D14.] 
 The initial catalyst for the decline was an announcement late Friday by Novell Inc. that its fourth-quarter financial results would fall far short of Wall Street estimates. But analysts noted that Novell was only the latest in a series of big technology companies to disappoint in the September quarter, and they expected more to follow.
Technology stocks, which have led the broader stock market higher all year, have had a series of one-day selloffs in the last few months that were followed by immediate rebounds. But because there was more bad news after the close of the market yesterday, some analysts concluded that this decline might last longer.
Motorola Inc. reported earnings of 81 cents a share, slightly below the average estimate of 83 cents, based on 25 analysts surveyed by IBES International. Sequent Computer Systems also said that its earnings would fall below estimates.
In addition, orders for computer chips dropped 2.1 percent in September, although the ratio of new orders to sales remained positive, an industry association reported.
"We're going to see a selloff until you see some flow of good numbers," said Michael Murphy, editor of the California Technology Stock Letter, "and that will not happen until next week, if it happens at all. The rest of this week is going to be anticipation and fear of more negative surprises."
The Microsoft Corporation is to report its third-quarter earnings next week, and many analysts expect them to be positive. But if they are disappointing -- or perhaps, just on target -- this could lead to more selling.
After any sharp run-up in the market, analysts worry about what they call corrections -- sharp selloffs as investors decide that the rally is over or that it has just gone too far too fast. Because of such correction jitters, bad news is more damaging and even usually positive news can be interpreted negatively, setting off selling as money managers try to lock in profits before prices plunge.
But corrections are also seen as positive because once over, there is room for stocks to rally again.
Novell attributed its expectation of lower earnings to a steep drop in the sales of its Wordperfect line of personal computer applications, primarily due to the fact that the company had not yet shipped versions of the programs tailored to Microsoft's new operating system, Windows 95.
Novell said applications sales could fall 56 percent, to $59 million, from $134 million in the period a year earlier, and that it expected earnings of 15 cents to 18 cents a share while the consensus estimate had been for the company to earn 28 cents.
In response, Novell shares plummeted $2.75 yesterday, to $14.625, in Nasdaq trading.
Although Novell's problems in the quarter were partly predictable, and partly specific to the company, analysts said they contributed to a growing anxiety among investors about technology stocks in general. After a dramatic run-up in the first eight months of the year, many analysts have suggested that the group is ripe for a selloff, and any piece of bad news from a major company can act as a catalyst. I.B.M. began a series of earnings warnings from large companies on Sept. 13.
"Anybody who follows Novell closely was probably not surprised by the announcement Friday, but in terms of the technology-stock anxiety, it just reinforced what was already going on," said Peter Rogers, an analyst with Bear, Stearns & Company in San Francisco. He noted that his index of 31 software stocks was up 135 percent since June 1994, so some sort of correction was inevitable.
"One has to view this as painful in the short term, but healthy in the long run," Mr. Rogers said.
Technology companies appeared to defy their usual seasonal dip this summer, and confident analysts began talking about a "secular change," spurred largely by the unexpected growth of the consumer computer market and a similarly unexpected surge in use of the Internet. The introduction of Windows 95 in August was also seen as a spur to continued growth.
But as third-quarter results begin to be announced, there is a growing perception that growth has slowed, and indeed, that Windows 95 may not have met analysts' high expectations.
Mr. Murphy said that after a few false starts, technology stocks had entered the long-anticipated correction.
"It's what we had feared; the industry had built up too much inventory in anticipation of Windows 95," he said. "They believed the Microsoft hype, and it clearly is not happening." He said he expected canceled orders for chips and other components, and retail price cuts that would keep technology stocks depressed for three to four months.
Firm numbers for Windows 95 sales are not yet available, and will not be until Microsoft reports its results next week, but anecdotal evidence is beginning to show up indicating that its sales are strong, but not up to the most optimistic estimates. Microsoft's European president, Bernard Vergnes, said yesterday that there was excess Windows 95 stock in distribution channels.
"The problem is they shipped 8 million to 10 million copies on Day One, and we only expect them to sell 10 million copies in total over the next 18 months," said Rick Sherlund, an analyst with Goldman, Sachs. "The distribution channel was reluctant to under-order -- they didn't know what would happen -- so everyone over-ordered," he said. "The sell-through rate is not living up to the original hype."

HEADLINE: JAPANESE DELAYED LETTING U.S. KNOW OF BIG BANK LOSS

BYLINE: By SHERYL WuDUNN 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Oct. 9

 BODY:
The Japanese Government said today that it knew of a huge loss by a rogue trader at Daiwa Bank's New York operation six weeks before American regulators were told of the $1.1 billion scandal. The failure to inform Washington comes as both Governments have said that they are working closely on sensitive financial issues.
Several American officials said in private that they were outraged by Japan's failure to disclose the scandal, which led to the resignations today of top officials of Daiwa Bank. In public, they said simply that the issue of notification was just one of many aspects of the incident under investigation. 
 The disclosure raised a host of questions about why officials in Japan's Ministry of Finance kept their counterparts in Washington in the dark for so long, particularly when Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin has been expressing grave concern about the solidity of the Japanese banking system. Mr. Rubin has said recently that the cooperation between Tokyo and Washington is close on issues ranging from efforts to support the dollar to Japan's program to revive its economy.
Treasury Department officials declined to be interviewed on the subject, but even from the muted statement the department issued today it was clear that Japan's failure to notify Federal regulators was regarded as a serious breach.
"The Daiwa Bank situation is an open investigation at the Justice Department, and I cannot comment on this issue," said Howard Schloss, the chief spokesman for Mr. Rubin. "As a matter of policy if Japan or any country's regulatory authorities become aware of significant financial issues of concern to the United States, we would expect to be fully informed in a timely manner. If this were not to occur, it would be a matter of great concern to us."
Federal and state banking regulations require a bank operating in New York to report immediately any significant improprieties that it discovers and any development that significantly affects its previous financial statements. Daiwa has said that it was not aware that this was a legal requirement and that it regarded as only an opinion the advice of its American law firm that it report the losses promptly.
Today's disclosures effectively spread responsibility for the scandal beyond the bank to include the Japanese Government as well. Japanese officials insisted that while they knew about the suspicions of improprieties -- including a letter describing the huge losses sent by the rogue trader to Daiwa's president in July -- they were under no obligation to tell American officials that United States laws might have been broken. Kyosuke Shinozawa, Japan's Vice Minister of Finance, said today that it was Daiwa's responsibility, not the ministry's, to notify American regulators.
"If it is true, it's certainly a dent to their credibility," S. David Snoddy, a bank analyst with Jardine Fleming Securities Ltd., said of today's disclosures and the ministry officials. "And it shows they knowingly allowed a bank under their supervision to basically break the rules of another country."
"It certainly changes how the public sees them," he added. "It moves from a situation of Daiwa being on trial to the ministry being on trial."
There were also suggestions today that Daiwa issued misleading statements two weeks ago when the scope of the loss was made public.
At the time of the initial disclosures, it appeared that Toshihide Iguchi, a Japanese-born bond trader in Daiwa Bank's New York office, had deceived the bank for 11 years, losing $1.1 billion and forging 30,000 trading slips and other documents to cover up his mounting losses. Daiwa has said that it first learned of the huge deception from the rambling 30-page confession that Mr. Iguchi sent to Tokyo in July.
Daiwa had earlier said that Japanese and American regulators were notified simultaneously, on Sept. 18, about the scandal. But Daiwa executives said at a news conference today that they had informally advised the Ministry of Finance's top banking official, Yoshimasa Nishimura, of the problem on Aug. 8.
While the ministry confirmed that the meeting with the bank occurred, it tried to play it down, suggesting that it was a chance meeting and that Mr. Nishimura was given only sketchy information. It also denied that it was backtracking on previous statements about exactly when it was told of the losses by Daiwa.
"It was a very difficult and delicate case," said a ministry official, who insisted on not being identified. "At that time, the financial authorities judged it was premature to share the information with other authorities."
At the Aug. 8 meeting, Akira Fujita, the president of Daiwa, told the ministry that he had received a letter from an employee in its New York branch. Mr. Fujita added that the letter stated that the trader had incurred a big loss from United States bond dealings, according to Toshio Muraki, the director of the commercial banking division at the ministry.
Mr. Fujita said then that the bank was not sure of the letter's accuracy and was investigating it, according to Mr. Muraki.
Mr. Nishimura at the ministry then told Mr. Fujita to "find out the situation as soon as possible and report to us immediately when you do," Mr. Muraki said.
On Sept. 12, Daiwa told the ministry of the $1.1 billion loss and gave a general outline of how it happened. Daiwa did not make its official report to United States authorities until six days later, and Finance Ministry officials did not inform the United States either.
Another ministry official emphasized that it was the bank's responsibility, not the ministry's, to inform American authorities of the scandal.
"We receive all kinds of whistle-blower calls everyday, but we do not report it before we clarify whether it is true," Mr. Muraki said today in a phone interview. "On Sept. 12, we told the bank to report to authorities including the Bank of Japan and the United States institutions as soon as possible, but I did not tell them they should do it within a certain number of days."
Mr. Muraki also mentioned that Sept. 15 was a national holiday. However, on Sept. 14, Daiwa Bank reported the losses to the Bank of Japan, according to news reports in Tokyo.
"We just said we received a report on Sept. 18 because that was the date the official report was submitted," Mr. Muraki said, referring to the day Daiwa turned in its official report of the loss to the ministry.
David Threadgold, a bank analyst at BZW Securities (Japan) Ltd., said of the Federal Reserve, "If I were the Fed, I'd be furious."
Daiwa officials also disclosed today that its United States subsidiary, Daiwa Bank Trust, had hidden $97 million in losses from financial authorities since 1987.
Today's disclosures were made at the same time that Daiwa announced the resignations of Mr. Fujita and Sumio Abekawa, the chairman. Mr. Fujita's resignation takes effect immediately, but Mr. Abekawa will not step down until March.
Mr. Iguchi has been arrested by the Federal Bureau of Investigation.
Three other Daiwa employees in the New York branch office worked with Mr. Iguchi in trading Treasury bonds, but it is unclear whether they were aware of Mr. Iguchi's deception, Japanese newspapers reported today. Still, the reports speculated that American authorities might consider the three Japanese employees as accomplices because they worked under Mr. Iguchi.
The Daiwa scandal has further tainted American perceptions of Japanese financial institutions as Japan's banks try to deal with at least $500 billion in bad loans. Because of all these problems, even the best of Japan's banks are paying at least a quarter of a percentage point more than prevailing interest rates when they raise funds in overseas money markets.

HEADLINE: Dow Falls 42.99 Points; Technology Issues Feel Pressure

BYLINE: By LEONARD SLOANE 

 BODY:
The stock market stumbled badly yesterday, pulled down by many of the same technology stocks that have been the leaders of this year's rally.
The Dow Jones industrial average fell 42.99 points, or nearly 1 percent, to close at 4,726.22. 
 Of the major market indicators, the greatest fall was taken by the Nasdaq composite index, which is loaded with technology issues. It sank 27.30 points, or 2.70 percent, to 984.74. This decline, on better than average trading volume on the Columbus Day holiday, brought the index to its lowest level since Aug. 3, when it closed at 983.75.
"It was a one-story market focused on technology earnings," said Barbara G. Marcin, vice president of Citibank Global Asset Management. "It will be important to see what carries through tomorrow when everyone is back."
Wall Street has become increasingly worried that corporate profits for the latest quarter will prove disappointing. In the last month, almost 100 companies have warned that their earnings would be sharply below analysts' expectations.
"When companies pre-announce lower-than-expected earnings, they are really getting clipped," Ms. Marcin noted.
With the Treasury bond market closed yesterday because of the holiday and little in the way of outside news to influence stocks, prices were more related to anticipated or reported weak profits than to any other single factor.
The selling on Wall Street sent the Dow industrials down as much as 57.47 points during trading. As soon as it fell 50 points, the New York Stock Exchange invoked its "circuit breaker" rules, which were established after the 1987 market crash to limit excessive market volatility.
Computer-guided trading was responsible for almost half the decline in the Dow, according to Birinyi Associates. "Program trading played a major part in the drop in the Dow, but it was not the only factor," said Jeffrey Rubin, an analyst at Birinyi.
The Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks eased 4.12 points, or seven-tenths of 1 percent, to 578.37. And the American Stock Exchange market value index closed at 527.48, down 6.06 points, or 1.14 percent.
Declining issues on the Big Board exceeded advancers by more than 2 to 1, at 1,641 to 623. But in contrast to the steady turnover on Nasdaq, only 275.3 million shares changed hands in slow trading on the New York exchange, compared with 313.7 million shares on Friday.
Nasdaq volume on the holiday was 416.3 million shares, compared with an average daily volume in 1995 of 374 million shares. Turnover on Nasdaq has exceeded 500 million shares during eight sessions in 1995, including the all-time record volume day of 597.5 million shares on July 19.
Nasdaq's automated trading system was closed down for an hour yesterday, officials said, because of a computer failure. The problem is the latest in a series of glitches related to a broad upgrade of Nasdaq computer systems aimed at handling the market's rapid growth. In July 1994, a software problem led to several shutdowns of the nation's second-largest market, one of which lasted for two and a half hours.
Among technology issues, three companies that projected disappointing earnings on Friday all suffered declines yesterday. Novell fourth-quarter fell 2 3/4, to 14 5/8. DSC Communications sank 5 1/8 a share, to 39 1/4. And BMC Software dropped 8 3/4, to 34 1/2.
Other technology shares that fell included those of Micron Technology, down 5 5/8, to 65; Microsoft, down 2 3/4, to 83 1/8; Intel, down 1 7/8, to 60 1/8; and Cisco Systems, down 2 5/8, to 64 7/16.
I.B.M. fell 2 1/8, to 92; Hewlett-Packard lost 2 5/8, to 78 1/4, and Texas Instruments dropped 4 1/2 to 70 3/8.
The Andrew Corporation, which was downgraded yesterday by a Merrill Lynch analyst, plunged 10 7/8 a share, to 43.
Scientific-Atlanta said late last week that its first-quarter profits would not meet Wall Street estimates; yesterday, its shares tumbled 3, to 12 5/8. Performance Systems International predicted a third-quarter loss and dropped 1 1/2, to 15 1/8.
Duracraft lost a third of its value, falling 12 1/2, to 24 3/4. The company, which makes heaters, said its third-quarter earnings would fall more than 60 percent.
Shares of forest products and paper companies -- one of the so-called cyclical groups that are highly sensitive to changes in the economy -- were also sluggish, as traders demonstrated concerns over their economic prospects. International Paper closed at 37 5/8, down 1 3/8 a share; Georgia-Pacific closed at 82 5/8, down 2 3/8; Mead closed at 54 3/4, down 1 1/2; Boise Cascade closed at 37 7/8, down 1 5/8, and Weyerhaeuser closed at 44 3/4, down 3/4.
Some brand-name consumer stocks bucked the downward trend, with analysts citing their ability to export successfully even if the United States economy weakened. Shares of Coca-Cola rose 7/8, to 71 5/8, and those of Procter & Gamble advanced 1, to 81 1/8.

HEADLINE: World Bank Urges Congress To Restore Promised U.S. Aid

BYLINE: By PAUL LEWIS 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 9

 BODY:
Finance ministers joined with the president of the World Bank today in pressing Congress to restore large amounts of money it is planning to cut from the United States' contribution to a key international development agency. They said such reductions would deal a severe blow to very poor nations.
The World Bank's development committee said the proposed cuts facing the International Development Association, the bank's soft-loan agency, "present a very serious risk to poverty reduction and economic growth in the world's poorest countries." 
 The 24-nation development committee "expressed great concern that potential reductions in contributions to I.D.A. were likely to jeopardize its future," and it stressed that other contributing nations attached great importance to "equitable burden-sharing," meaning that the United States should pay its share of the $18 billion fund.
If a nation fails to pay its contribution, others have the right to cut back their payments proportionately, as Germany and several other countries have hinted they may do if Congress withholds funds. The World Bank's new president, James D. Wolfensohn, responded with a terse "no" when asked if he had received any assurance that others would maintain financing if the United States reduced its contribution.
Mr. Wolfensohn, at a closing news conference here, said today, "For me, this is the single most important challenge in recent years to development assistance," adding that "a weakened I.D.A. would greatly hurt world stability." His remarks came at the end of a weekend of meetings here of finance ministers and central bankers of leading industrial nations.
Today's appeal reinforced a similar one over the weekend by the Committee of 24, a body representing all regions of the developing world. Both are 11th-hour efforts to influence Congress on the eve of a crucial conference between House and Senate representatives later this week that will seek agreement on a new United States aid bill.
The Clinton Administration has agreed to contribute $1.25 billion annually over three years to the fund, but the Senate has cut this year's installment to $775 million, and the House wants to provide $575 million.
The International Development Association offers long-term loans at nominal rates of interest to 78 countries with per-capita incomes of less than $865, in an attempt to jump-start their economic development.

HEADLINE: COMPANY REPORTS;
Earnings at Motorola Rose By 30.5% in Third Quarter

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
Motorola Inc. said yesterday that earnings rose 30.5 percent in the third quarter, less than what some analysts had expected.
A slowing United States economy and declining prices for cellular phones contributed to the disappointing earnings, analysts said. 
 Motorola earned $496 million, or 81 cents a share, up from $380 million, or 65 cents, in the comparable quarter a year earlier. Sales rose 21.1 percent, to $6.85 billion, from $5.66 billion.
The results were slightly below the average estimate of 83 cents, based on 25 analysts surveyed by Ibes International Inc. The highest estimate was 89 cents.
The results were announced after the stock market had closed. Earlier, shares of Motorola, which have fallen 9 percent in the last week, rose 25 cents, to $69, on the New York Stock Exchange.
Noting the number of big technology companies that have disappointed Wall Street in recent weeks, analysts said they expected Motorola's shares to fall today.
And the declining demand in the cellular industry portends a more difficult fourth quarter for Motorola, with slowing growth, analysts said.
"The December quarter coming up may be less than stellar overall for the industry," said Rakesh Sood, an analyst with Hambrecht & Quist, who had expected Motorola to have sales of more than $7 billion and per-share earnings of 84 cents.
In the third quarter, sales in the company's general systems business rose 21 percent, to $2.6 billion, with orders rising 14 percent. Motorola said growth in the cellular business was moderating in the United States and Europe, but continued to grow in other international markets.
"Cellular revenue was lower because the U.S. cellular market hasn't shown good growth this year," said Nikos Theodosopoulos, an analyst with UBS Securities.
Prices for cellular phones fell "somewhat more quickly" during this quarter than in the past, said Chris Galvin, president and chief operating officer for the company.
Sales of semiconductor products rose 28 percent, to $2.3 billion, with orders increasing 23 percent. Demand for chips in the personal computer and work station markets was highest, especially for the company's reduced instruction set microprocessors.
The company's gross margin narrowed to 35.9 percent, from 37.5 percent in the quarter a year ago because of increased start-up costs for chip manufacturing plants.
Motorola, like most other chip makers, is scrambling to add capacity for making chips. The company announced plans to spend $3 billion on a chip plant near Richmond to build Power PC microprocessors.

HEADLINE: Silent for Months, Health Lobby Takes On G.O.P.

BYLINE: By ADAM CLYMER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 9

 BODY:
For months, Republican plans to curb Federal health care spending have sailed along on a silent wave of interest group approval, or at least resignation, that seemed remarkable after the brawl over President Clinton's health care legislation.
While Democrats denounced the plans, advocates for the elderly were all but silent. Doctors bought an advertisement praising the plan. The insurance industry approved. The hospitals stuck out in their unhappiness, but even they seemed to have toned it down since last spring. 
 But now, cracks are showing. The American Medical Association is starting to complain about the impact on care; the American Association of Retired Persons is planning an advertisement campaign to declare that the cuts are too deep.
Weeks of flattering courtship and consultation of one group after another in Speaker Newt Gingrich's office, an effort that resulted in many provisions dear to their hearts, may not be enough to satisfy the major players because of one simple problem: money. If Republicans succeed in squeezing half a trillion dollars out of the health care system, hardly anyone will avoid a serious hit.
Some players worry that the trade-offs they were offered will be watered down or eliminated, while the Republicans stick to their overall dollar figures. At the heart of the plan in both houses of Congress is an effort to save $270 billion from Medicare, the health program for the elderly and disabled, and another $182 billion from Medicaid, the state-Federal program that serves the poor. The Medicaid program includes elderly who have become poor because of medical and nursing expenses.
Doctors know that the sharp curbs on malpractice lawsuits that Mr. Gingrich favors face a tough future in the Senate. Nursing homes worry that promises of access to the financial resources of their patients' adult children may not be kept. And all those, like teaching hospitals or community health centers, who were promised some sort of financial safety net know that such a commitment may be hard to maintain in a time of shortage.
Some of the earlier silence may have been dictated by a sense that Republican success was inevitable. But there was that same sense, for a time, about the Clinton plan; indeed one of the main reasons it failed was that many groups that liked it generally spent all their energy on their own particular interests, and none on overall support.
The pace of the Republicans' efforts may diminish the influence of the growing doubts. Their actual legislation only became available for inspection in the last week or so, and until then, the uncertainty about it stilled most lobbying forces. Republicans plan votes in both houses later this month, which leaves potential opponents little time.
The players had more time to focus on the Clinton plan. Its details were available in late September 1993, the bill itself by Oct. 28, and nobody expected votes on the floor before late spring of 1994. (In the end there were none at all because the plan was bleeding to death, riddled by months of attack advertisements.)
This year there has been less time to react, which may make the lobbyists less effective. But the shifts among interest groups are still important.
Take the American Medical Association, among the most ardently wooed organizations and a natural Republican ally. It negotiated early and often and started out supporting the plan until it soured on it last week. Indeed, as recently as Sept. 27, the A.M.A. bought an advertisement in The Washington Times to say: "Now it's time for action. Let your Representatives know you support the House Leadership's effort to reform Medicare."
And last week Kirk Johnson, the A.M.A.'s general counsel, said the group still believed that the plan faced up to long-term financing problems and liked its effort to reduce the threats of antitrust and malpractice lawsuits against doctors -- changes that enrage some consumer advocates.
"We are willing to take our fair share of pain for all the positive things that are in the bill," Mr. Johnson said.
But he continued, "What we can't agree to is price rollbacks that will impact on the quality of care."
The reductions were so severe, he said, that they "will unquestionably cause some physicians to leave Medicare."
The A.M.A.'s overall position is not settled. Officials have been promised another meeting with Mr. Gingrich; something might be worked out then.
Another case is the National Association of Community Health Centers, a smaller player, which represents centers in inner cities that treat about nine million people a year, most of them on Medicaid.
The Senate Finance Committee went out of its way to insulate these centers, a War on Poverty invention from the 60's that even House Republicans used to say was the real route to medical care for everyone. The committee voted to set aside for the centers 1 percent of the new state block grants that will replace the existing Medicaid program.
But Dan Hawkins, the policy director of the health center association, said his group remained "deeply concerned that the level of resources in this bill and the structural changes that the legislation would make in the Medicaid program are going to have significant negative effects for not only access to care for low-income Americans, but on the cost of care for all Americans."
Or consider the American Association of Retired Persons. Its friendly nonendorsement of the Clinton plan in 1993 and 1994 was a grave disappointment to the Administration. Instead of bolstering the President's plan, the association campaigned for more commitments to the elderly beyond the ones the President promised, like coverage for prescription drugs.
With its 35 million members, the retirees' group has been of particular interest to Speaker Gingrich. Its legislative director, John Rother, acknowledged last week that the Republicans "have been responsive to some of our concerns, by taking off the table increases in co-payments and deductibles, and even more by fundamentally permitting the fee-for-service Medicare program to continue."
But on Thursday, Tess Canja, an association board member speaking for the organization, told Senate Democrats that "the $276 billion in Medicare spending reductions in the Senate Finance Committee proposal is too much, too fast."
And Mr. Rother said today that his group's leaders would start taking their concerns to the membership.
Money is not what bothers the Health Insurance Association of America, the industry's dominant trade group, whose television advertisements made stars of Harry and Louise and devastated the Clinton plan.
What bothers the trade group are the rules surrounding a provision designed to please the doctors and the hospitals, enabling them to join to provide care in what are called provider sponsored networks, without going through insurance companies.
Bill Gradison, president of the insurance association, scoffed at the Republican plan as a "tip of the hat to the doctors and the hospitals," and he warned against the lack of regulation.
"This is shades of the S & L situation," Mr. Gradison said. "If these entities are allowed to operate and become insolvent, who picks up the tab?"
But that is the provision before Congress that the hospitals like best. Richard J. Pollack, executive vice president of the American Hospital Association, said, "If we are to be able to manage in the future, this is critical."
Insurers "don't want the competition," Mr. Pollack said.
But Mr. Johnson of the A.M.A. said, "The challenge to find economies and efficiencies is something that ultimately doctors are going to have to do." It is essential to give networks a boost at the start, he said, by freeing them from "the potentially heavy hand of regulation by the states."
Mary Nell Lehnhard, speaking for another foe of the Republican plan, the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association, said, "We're concerned that all the consumer protections are going out the window."
The problem could be severe, Ms. Lehnhard said, because the provider networks "will be in the individual market, which is so high-risk."
The dispute over provider networks is the biggest example of how complicated any political intervention in the health business can be. Without extra money, it is hard to please one player without displeasing another. And when the money is less, not more, it is just about impossible not to displease many.
The only criticism that is yet on the airwaves is in television advertisements by unions and the Democratic National Committee. Neither is spending much money. Among the providers, the disagreements have thus far been relatively mild. Only the retirees' group is talking about any full-fledged public campaign, and it does not plan to use television.

HEADLINE: The Rebellion in 'Pole City'

BYLINE: By AGIS SALPUKAS 

DATELINE: CLYDE, Ohio

 BODY:
Two sets of poles carrying a welter of transmission lines run parallel down the narrow streets of this town -- one for the big regional power company, Toledo Edison, and the other, newer set for a municipal utility created six years ago, Clyde Light and Power.
This conservative farming community of 6,000 people nestled amid the cornfields and fruit orchards of northeastern Ohio might seem an unlikely recruiting ground for a consumer rebellion against America's powerful utility industry. But in the late 1980's, soaring electricity bills persuaded residents to break their ties with Toledo Edison and set up their own transmission system. Today, most of them are hooked up to it -- and enjoying a savings windfall averaging more than $200 a year. 
 "It's a new ball game of lower costs," boasts Dennis E. Benesh, the manager of Clyde Light and Power, as he guides his Jeep Cherokee along streets so jammed with utility poles that newspapers in the region have taken to calling it Pole City.
Clyde officials may not have realized it at the time, but in kicking out Toledo Edison they were helping to revive a movement that briefly swept the country early in the century: municipalization. The original wave created thousands of publicly owned systems. Today, about 2,000 survive and serve one in seven Americans, mostly in small towns but also in some big cities like Seattle, Nashville and Los Angeles.
And now, a growing number of localities again are opting for ownership. In a trend that runs counter to the groundswell to privatize city services from garbage collection to running airports, 33 municipal systems have been formed since 1980, industry analysts say. Currently, 25 communities are actively pursuing conversion and scores more are studying the idea. Among those furthest along are Palm Springs, Calif.; Las Cruces, N.M., and Alma, Mich. Voters in Aberdeen, N.J., will decide in a referendum on Nov. 7 whether to make the switch.
New York State's proposed takeover of the Long Island Lighting Company, while a special case largely because of the mothballed Shoreham nuclear power plant, would follow a similar path of converting to public ownership in an attempt to get rates down. [Page D6.]
In the old days, the motive was necessity: rural areas could not get investor-owned utilities to come in because there was no profit in it. Today, the driving force is economics, with towns trying to get the utilities out.
But while municipal utilities offer savings averaging 25 percent, according to one industry study, creating them is fraught with dangers, as the town of Clyde found out. The cost can be considerable for localities with narrow tax bases. Opposition from established utilities can be fierce. And the investment could turn out to be a losing proposition over the long term.
It was not just higher electricity rates that prompted many municipalities in the 1980's to take a new look at an old idea. The United States was enjoying a surplus of electricity-transmission capacity, and changes in Federal law made it easier for big utilities to sell power outside their service areas. Most important, American industry was reorganizing -- and putting pressure on towns where its plants were situated to shop around for cheaper energy.
Sometimes, just threatening to abandon a utility can pay off. Brook Park, Ohio, considered but ultimately dropped plans to form a municipal system five years ago. The Ford Motor Company, which operates two engine plants in Brook Park, a Cleveland suburb, used its support for the proposal to negotiate lower rates from the Cleveland Electric and Illuminating Company. Ford donated part of the $8 million savings to Brook Park, which uses the money to send checks of about $185 to each utility customer in town every December.
"It's an important issue even in areas where it might be difficult and costly to accomplish," said Barry Abramson, a utility analyst for Prudential Securities. "It puts a lot of pressure on the local utility. That often leads to a negotiated resolution for lower rates."
Here in Clyde, most residents are delighted with the change, which has resulted in rates 25 percent below those charged by Toledo Edison. Even so, other localities contemplating public ownership would do well to study the town's example. Not only did it have to fight a rancorous battle to dislodge an entrenched energy provider, it also took a huge long-term gamble that it might yet lose.
"You may get most of the savings dropped in your lap anyway," as a result of deregulation in the power industry, said Robert D. Glynn Jr., president of Pacific Gas and Electric, the nation's largest utility.
Moreover, like other small utilities, Clyde Light and Power could be vulnerable to sudden changes in business conditions. For example, some critics wonder how well the Clyde system would do if the local Whirlpool Corporation plant, which generates 60 percent of the utility'srevenue, was to unexpectedly close or switch to another supplier.
And recently, Clyde officials disquieted even some supporters by trying to force Toledo Edison to cut off service to its few remaining customers and tear down its transmission lines, in effect replacing an old monopoly with a new one.
The idea for cutting loose from Toledo Edison was first floated in 1986 by a new town manager, Nelson Summit. The advantages seemed clear-cut: A municipal utility can shop around for cheap power, does not have to pay taxes or dividends to stockholders, and can raise money cheaply by issuing tax-free bonds. The town hired a consulting firm, which issued a report favoring municipalization. Meantime, a series of sharp rate increases by Toledo Edision had town residents grumbling.
Clyde officials gained a powerful ally when the Whirlpool factory, which employs 3,200 workers and is the anchor of the local economy, decided to support their drive.
Clyde tried to buy Toledo Edison's distribution system, but was rebuffed by an unrealistic asking price of $32 million. Then it explored the idea of setting up its own system of poles and lines. At town meetings and in full-page newspaper ads, Toledo Edison attacked the plan and reminded residents of the frequent outages that occurred with the old municipal utility that Clyde abandoned 25 years ago.
Even after voters approved bond issues totaling $11 million to build a system, Toledo Edison fought a rear-guard action, filing suit to retain the right to serve the community. Clyde ultimately agreed out of court to let Toledo Edison continue offering service. Toledo Edison has been able to hold on to some apartment buildings because the landlords prefer its policy of holding tenants, not landlords, responsible for unpaid bills. It has also kept some elderly and low-income customers by providing special services to them.
For John Courtney, one of the consultants instrumental in organizing the transition, the lesson of all this was clear. "Utilities will not roll over and play dead," he said. "If you don't have the stomach for this politically, don't waste your money."
Mr. Courtney, who heads his own consulting firm, crisscrosses the East and Midwest by plane and car advising more than a dozen towns on setting up municipal systems. He is skeptical about the notion that municipalities will get cheaper energy by sitting back and waiting for changes. While a number of states, including California, are lifting restrictions on the purchase of cheap power from providers in other states, change is coming slowly, he says.
Meantime, the industry remains highly regulated, and many utilities are burdened by cost overruns from nuclear power plants or other special costs that they are forced to pass on to consumers. Even Clyde's supplier of electricity is under pressure. Ohio Power, a unit of the American Electric Power Company, one of the country's largest utilities, faces enormous expenses for bringing many of its coal-fired plants into compliance with clean-air laws.
Mr. Benesh, the manager of Clyde Light and Power, is upbeat. He says the city negotiated a deal with Whirlpool that would require the company to pay $3 million of the utility's debt if Whirlpool switched to another energy provider. He also says he is keeping costs low with a staff of just five that operates out of a house that the city already owned, with the maintenance crew also using an older city-owned building.
For all his confident talk, doubts about Clyde's municipalization persist. And a recent effort by the town to establish itself as the sole energy supplier only galvanized a faltering opposition.
In January, the City Council decreed that all new hookups must be to the Clyde system, and it began proceedings before the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio to require Toledo Edison to take down its lines, an action that would force the remaining holdouts to switch to the Clyde system.
The move touched off a furor. A group of residents, mostly from the 300 remaining Toledo Edison customers, formed a protest group called Voice for Choice. Some of them showed up at City Council meetings, wearing T-shirts emblazoned with the group name.
"What's frightening people is that they will be a monopoly," said Tami Keegan, one of two founders of the group. Phyllis Wyss, the other, questioned the long-term viability of the local utility. "You have to look down the road," she said. "They have no way to generate electricity on their own."
Toledo Edison itself is counterattacking. It has gone to court to fight the town's move to take away its remaining customers. It has asked the state utility commission to force Clyde to reimburse it for a portion of its past investments. And it has undertaken a new public-relations offensive, warning residents that its forced withdrawal would deprive the town of $85,000 in taxes.
Fred J. Lange, the president of Toledo Edison, acknowledges that Clyde residents are getting lower rates for now, but estimates that the reduction is 15 percent, not 25.
Besides, he says, his utility is working to hold rate increases to a bare minimum, and that effort will eventually be evident when comparisons are made. "The spread will narrow," he said. "In the short term there will be savings. In the long run it's not the right way to go."

HEADLINE: Kukrit Pramoj, Thai Ex-Prime Minister, Dies at 84

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE 

 BODY:
Kukrit Pramoj, a former Prime Minister of Thailand who steered the country through a difficult and politically dangerous period after the end of the Vietnam War, died yesterday in Bangkok. He was 84 and had been hospitalized for heart disease and diabetes.
Mr. Kukrit -- who was usually addressed with the noble title of Mom Rajawong because he was the son of a royal prince -- was one of Thailand's most colorful, outspoken and versatile characters. He co-founded a newspaper and wrote political commentary, mastered classical Thai dancing and opened a school to teach it to younger generations, acted in a film -- "The Ugly American" with Marlon Brando -- and remained an unashamedly opinionated elder statesman until the end of his life. 
 It was as a defender of nascent Thai democracy in the 1970's that Mr. Kukrit is best remembered by historians of contemporary Southeast Asia. Prime Minister for only 14 months in 1975-1976, he faced the collapse of South Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia to Communist movements, which many believed would soon threaten Thailand.
But Mr. Kukrit, rejecting the domino theory, established diplomatic relations with China and asked American troops to leave the huge bases from which they had mounted much of the war in Vietnam.
These bold steps were popular with Thai intellectuals, particularly leftists who had a influence on his thinking, John Bresnan, executive director of the Pacific Basin studies program at Columbia University, said yesterday. But his policies quickly provoked a conservative backlash. Mr. Kukrit and his Social Action Party were defeated in an election in 1976 that he had called in the hope of strengthening his political hand.
While Prime Minister, Mr. Kukrit tried to build a democratic polity strong enough to resist persistent pressures from the Thai Army, which has staged repeated coups over more than half a century. As late as 1987, when he was in his 70's, he was still defying the generals. After a speech in which he accused the military of trying to establish the equivalent of a Communist-style "politburo" to run the country, 250 ill-disciplined Thai Army rangers, troops known for violent behavior, arrived in buses from the remote northeast and tried to break into his home to threaten him.
When the Army commander, Gen. Chavalit Yongchaiyudh, who is now Defense Minister, did not discipline the troops, a storm of criticism arose in the ever-bolder Thai press. Students from 21 institutions of higher education -- precursors of the student leaders and young professionals who would take to the streets to defend democracy in 1992 -- came to his home with bouquets of flowers, a touching, traditional Thai way of showing respect or making amends.
Mr. Kukrit was born on April 20, 1911, and was educated in Thailand and at Oxford University. At 25, he married Pakpring Tongyai and they had two children: a son, Rongrit, and a daughter, Visumitra. His political career began in 1946 with his election to the Thai Parliament. Several years later he co-founded the Thai-language newspaper Siam Rath. He did not withdraw formally from politics until about four years ago.
A quiet nationalist -- his dog barked only at Westerners, he would tell visitors with a chuckle -- Mr. Kukrit became a strong advocate of holding on to Thai traditions in architecture, language and the arts while others were rushing into the Westernization that accompanied a phenomenal economic takeoff. In the center of booming Bangkok, surrounded by rising concrete apartment blocks and offices, he lived in a classical Thai house built of tropical wood, and filled it with Thai treasures. He set a powerful, if increasingly lonely, example.
"We Thai can lead a life that is genuinely Thai and be quite happy about it," he said in an interview in 1987. "We don't have to live in Western houses or employ Western methods in our daily lives. If we were to limit ourselves to just being Thai people, I think we would be happier all around."
In addition to his immediate family, Mr. Kukrit is survived by a brother, Seni Pramoj, 90, also a former Prime Minister.

South Africa McDonald's Loses Name

BYLINE: By DONALD G. McNEIL Jr. 

DATELINE: JOHANNESBURG, Oct. 9

 BODY:
In a court ruling that could profoundly discourage American businesses planning to enter South Africa, the McDonald's Corporation has lost the right to call its restaurants now under construction here "McDonald's."
On Friday, a provincial court in Pretoria ruled that the company had abandoned its trademark by failing to use it since it first registered it in South Africa in 1968. It also closed two possible avenues for American corporations fighting for their trademarks: It held that McDonald's contention that it did not open a restaurant here because of apartheid sanctions made no difference, and it ruled that it did not matter that McDonald's is a household name in America since it is unknown here. 
 The International Trademark Association said the decision might be interpreted as turning South Africa into "a safe haven for trademark pirates."
McDonald's plans to appeal to a higher court. Also it hopes that the Registrar of Trademarks might reject the application by the winner of last week's lawsuit, a South African man who owns the Chicken Licken chain here and a hamburger stand in Durban that has been operating under the name McDonald's since 1978.
The new South African Government is even more upset. It is very eager to attract American investment and to get off the United States Government's "watch list" of countries that do not adequately protect intellectual property.
The Minister of Trade and Information, Trevor Manuel, said he would ask the Justice Ministry for a quick hearing of the appeal. "It is the Government's firm belief that foreign companies are entitled to proper intellectual property protection," he said.
The American Embassy has expressed its "surprise, dismay and concern" over the decision.
If Mr. Samboros does win, other American corporations may be even more hesitant than they are to invest in South Africa or open franchises here.
South Africans love things with American cachet, and the country is full of logos that look familiar but have something slightly off about them. There is a Toys R Us chain with the R backwards, but its mascot is a blue elephant, not Geoffrey the Giraffe. In the upscale Sandton City mall north of Johannesburg, there's a Spago's restaurant that serves salad by weight, a Ghirardelli's that doesn't sell chocolate and a Trumps that the Donald surely never licensed.
For now, George Samboros is the closest to owning the South African rights to Ronald McDonald, Big Macs and even the golden arches themselves. Using the profits of his chicken franchises, he plans to open a chain of McDonald's here.
"We will wait until we are the registered owner, and then, if the American corporation opens a restaurant called McDonald's, we will sue them for trademark infringement," said Sean Ryan, a lawyer for Mr. Samboros. Winning, he estimated, would entitle his client to about 5 percent of the gross sales of the outlets.
Inviting a court battle, McDonald's still plans to open its first two outlets, in Johannesburg and Cape Town under its own name on Nov. 16.
There's no reason to assume that politics or anti-American bias are behind the decision. South Africa has long had an independent judiciary, one that often overturned attempts by the apartheid-era Government to illegally imprison or ban dissidents. In this case, the court seems to be following the letter of the law.
McDonald's registered its trademarks here in 1968, 1974, 1979, 1980, 1985 and 1993. But under South African law -- as under American and British -- a company must use a trademark within five years to keep it.
McDonald's never opened a restaurant or licensed a franchise, and did not seem to have serious plans to do so until Mr. Samboros, in early 1993, asked the trademarks office to grant him the McDonald's name.
McDonald's sued to stop him, arguing that the law said well-known companies need not use their trademarks locally to protect them.

HEADLINE: Progress on Cuba

 BODY:
Neither Fidel Castro's Government in Havana nor hard-line Cuban exiles in the United States are happy with the Clinton Administration's eased policies on travel, humanitarian relief and cultural exchange with Cuba. But the new approach, incorporated in an executive order signed last week, well serves American interests. By letting ordinary Cubans receive more financial help from their American relatives and gain wider exposure to American ideas, Washington improves the chances for a liberalized political climate in Cuba.
Most of the travel and family assistance restrictions Mr. Clinton is now easing were imposed after Mr. Castro allowed thousands of Cubans to set sail across the Florida Straits last year. A new diplomatic agreement to expand legal migration of Cubans to the United States resolved that crisis. Mr. Clinton's order also allows American human rights and relief groups to widen the scope of their work in Cuba and American news organizations to open permanent bureaus there. 
 As advance word of the new American approach leaked out, Havana reacted warily. It correctly reads Washington's goal as undermining Cuban Communism. Hard-line Cuban-American groups object to any easing of restrictions. But more moderate Cuban-American voices welcome the chance to ease the suffering of family members back home, widen channels of communication and make it possible for American newspapers and broadcasters to report on conditions in Cuba.
Meanwhile, a harsh Republican bill that would tighten the outdated American economic embargo on Cuba has passed the House by a large margin and will soon be considered by the Senate. While Mr. Clinton has stopped short of lifting the embargo, he offers a much better approach to encouraging democracy in Cuba.

HEADLINE: Coffee Trading Move in Doubt

 BODY:
New York's Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange Inc. canceled a special meeting that had been scheduled yesterday to vote on a proposed move to New Jersey, raising doubts about its relocation plans.
In a statement to its membership dated Oct. 5, the exchange noted that the meeting had been scheduled before New York City and New York State offered millions of dollars in a bid to keep the exchange in New York. 
 The statement added that the Coffee Exchange's Board of Managers would consider New York's new financing offer at its next regular meeting, scheduled for tomorrow.
Last week the city and state offered an incentive package worth $75 million to $80 million to the Coffee Exchange and the New York Cotton Exchange, including $30 million in cash, in an effort to keep them in New York.
The Coffee and Cotton exchanges announced in July that they intended to build a joint trading facility in Jersey City, across the Hudson River from their current home at the World Trade Center in downtown Manhattan.

HEADLINE: Price of Global Warming? Debate Weighs Dollars and Cents

BYLINE: By WILLIAM K. STEVENS 

 BODY:
IF the world's climate is warming because of the burning of fossil fuels, how much will it cost to fix the problem? And is the fix worth the cost?
Some economists say that reducing emissions of heat-trapping carbon dioxide by 20 percent, as has been proposed to nations that signed the the 1992 climate treaty, would crimp the economy, reducing the gross domestic product of the United States by 1 percent to 2 percent. Others are more upbeat, saying that simply making energy production more efficient would take care of the problem -- at a net profit to the economy. 
 The debate over the costs and benefits of averting climate warming has suddenly assumed new pertinence now that the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change is concluding for the first time that at least part of the global warming of the last century was probably caused by the heat-trapping greenhouse gases emitted by the burning of fossil fuel.
The panel's scientists have estimated, according to recently revealed drafts of a new report, that the world's average surface temperature will rise by 1.4 to 6.3 degrees Fahrenheit over the next century unless emissions of carbon dioxide are reduced, and that this amount of warming will probably cause widespread dislocations in the economies and environments of nations.
The economic argument over how best to address these consequences will come to a boil starting tomorrow in Montreal, where a subgroup of the intergovernmental panel is to meet for three days to draw up its final report to policy makers on the costs and benefits of reducing greenhouse gases. The intergovernmental panel's mission is to advise the parties to the 1992 treaty.
As the Montreal meeting convenes, there appears to be a wide measure of agreement on one major point: that the world has significant opportunities to control emissions by making its energy system more efficient, and that these opportunities should be seized. Since energy efficiency is desirable for economic reasons, many economists argue, achieving it in the interest of heading off global warming amounts to a policy of "no regrets."
But there the arguments begin.
One school of thought holds that by carrying out the available means of improving energy efficiency, likemore efficient automobiles, emissions could be reduced by 60 percent over the next few decades. At the same time, according to this analysis, the more efficient use of energy would increase the gross domestic product by 1 percent to 2 percent. This gain does not include the benefits of averting the damage caused by climate change.
On the other side are the economic modelers, whose simulations show that reducing emissions by 20 percent below 1990 levels by the year 2010 would reduce the gross domestic product of the United States by 1 percent to 2 percent. This calculation also does not include the benefits of reduced damage to the climate.
The flaw in the modelers' analysis is that it assumes that the economy is already using energy as efficiently as possible and therefore underestimates the potential of more efficient energy practices, said Dr. Florintin Krause, an author of the intergovernmental panel's chapter covering the subject. Dr. Krause is an energy economist with the International Project for Sustainable Energy Paths, a research organization in El Cerrito, Calif.
The modelers reply that these efficiencies cannot be achieved on the scale that Dr. Krause believes. "We all agree there is some free lunch out there," said Dr. Richard Richels, an economist at the Electric Power Research Institute, an organization in Palo Alto, Calif., that is supported by the power industry. "What we don't agree on is how much." Dr. Richels, an expert on modeling, is also an author of the intergovernmental panel's report. "It's somewhat of a gamble as to who's right," he said. "Over time, we'll learn who's right."
Another author of the panel's report, Dr. William R. Cline of the Institute for International Economics in Washington, said that even if Dr. Krause was right, the early and relatively easy "no regrets" reductions would represent a one-time windfall whose impact would not come close to solving the emissions problem in the long term.
Both Dr. Richels and Dr. Cline argue that the long-term view should prevail, and this raises perplexing issues as to the timing of emissions reductions. Too large a reduction now, Dr. Richels said, could work a financial hardship on the economy by forcing it to replace physical plant and equipment with new technologies prematurely.
The intergovernmental panel, in a draft report, said there would be at least two replacement cycles over the next century. Each would offer an opportunity to adopt alternative fuels and technologies like solar and wind power, electric and hydrogen-powered vehicles, fuels made from wood or grain and nuclear power if safety concerns can be met. It makes economic sense, Dr. Richels argues, to use the cheaper fossil fuels now, while investing in the research and development that can bring down the cost of alternative fuels and technologies and make them more attractive in the next investment cycle.
Another point of contention has to do with the trade-offs involved in deciding whether to take stronger action sooner rather than later. Some economists say the only economically efficient course is to make very modest emissions reductions and to delay even those. Others say this merely delays effective action, thereby favoring the economic well-being of the present generation at the expense of future ones: today's consumers would behave like grasshoppers rather than ants.
Few analyses of the costs and benefits of dealing with climate change look more than a century ahead. But Dr. Cline said this was not far enough for a true reading. He said that if no emissions reductions were made, enough fossil fuel remained to allow atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations to rise for 300 years before mixing processes in the deep ocean started to stabilize them.
Placing a dollar value on the benefits of avoiding damage from climate change is an even more difficult exercise than calculating the costs. Some experts say that in some ways it may be impossible: what is the worth, for instance, of the culture of an ocean island destroyed by rising seas? Nevertheless, a number of attempts to calculate benefits have been made. The potential damages to be avoided include, for example, agricultural losses, damage to natural ecosystems, inundation by rising seas, higher cooling bills, human illness, displacement of populations and damages from extreme weather.
Typically, studies value the benefit of avoiding damages caused in the United States by a doubling of atmospheric carbon dioxide at 1 percent to 2.5 percent of the nation's gross domestic product -- roughly the same range of the modelers' estimates of cost. The benefits are probably higher for developing countries, Dr. Cline said.
But he points out that if the world pursues business as usual, atmospheric concentrations will not stop at a doubling. Concentrations three centuries from now could be eight times those of today, leading to a global average temperature about 18 degrees higher than now, he said. This would return the climate to something like that of the Cretaceous period, the heyday of the dinosaurs.
For this scale of warming, Dr. Cline calculates that the benefits of damage prevention in the United States would amount to at least 6 percent of the gross domestic product. The benefits of modest but increasingly stringent emissions reductions would exceed the costs at first, according to his analysis. But as soon as the early efficiency gains in fossil-fuel use have been exhausted, costs would outpace benefits for a few decades before benefits again exceeded them.
This calculation excludes what some scientists consider the possibility of catastrophe brought on by climate change. Some studies have suggested that a possible quadrupling of atmospheric carbon dioxide would so change the climate that the Gulf Stream would shut down. Without the Gulf Stream's warming influence, Northern Europe's climate could become as cold as that of Hudson Bay.
Many scientists also warn that there is no guarantee that warming or other climatic disruptions would be gradual; the system could suddenly shift to an unstable and highly damaging state. This possibility makes the estimate of climate damages and the benefits of preventing them even more uncertain.
In the face of this, many environmentalists invoke what is called the precautionary principle: although it is necessary to reduce costs as much as possible, cost should not stand in the way of whatever action is necessary to avoid the risk of catastrophe. A draft of the policy makers' summary of the working group about to meet in Montreal says that all told, the risk of "aggregate net damage" and the adoption of the precautionary principle "provide rationales for action beyond 'no regrets.' "

HEADLINE: Selloff Becomes 'Opportunity' as Stocks Reverse a Plunge

BYLINE: By EDWARD WYATT 

 BODY:
Investors dived into a rapidly falling stock market yesterday morning to snatch up shares of stocks -- particularly those of computer, software, communications and other technology companies that had plunged more than 5 percent in less than three days.
The result was a sharp reversal of a stock market decline that swept around the globe yesterday, producing big losses in Asian and European markets. The rebound also provides an illustration of how fiercely American investors have embraced the faith that stock prices will continue to rise over the long term. 
 After dropping more than 60 points in the first half-hour of trading, the Dow Jones industrial average finished the session down 5.42 points, at 4,720.80, a decline of just eleven-hundredths of 1 percent. Similarly, the Nasdaq composite index, which is rich with technology issues and initially fell more than 25 points, or 2.6 percent, finished down a mere 1.27 points at 983.47. At its lowest point yesterday, the index was down 5.4 percent since Thursday and 10.1 percent since peaking at 1,067.40 on Sept. 13.
"What that tells me is that the decline in the technology stocks that led to a drop in the market is overdone," said Steve G. Einhorn, portfolio strategist at Goldman, Sachs & Company. "These corrections are being increasingly and properly viewed as opportunities rather than an indication of any substantive problems."
Blindly buying stocks when the market declines could prove foolhardy if, as some market strategists believe, a general downtrend in stock prices continues through the end of the year. For his part, though, Mr. Einhorn believes that the stock market will be higher at the end of 1995 than it is now, the Dow by as much as 200 points.
Indeed, while the leading market averages finished slightly lower and more stocks declined in price than rose yesterday, share prices of several American technology companies rebounded yesterday to finish higher. Shares of the Intel Corporation, for example, rose $1.50, to $61.625, while those of the Microsoft Corporation rose 62.5 cents, to $83.75.
Investors in Motorola Inc. fared less well, though. The company, a maker of semiconductor chips and cellular phones, said on Monday night that it expected growth of its American and European cellular subscriber base to slow. Investors responded yesterday by sending its shares plummeting $5, to $64, on the New York Stock Exchange, where it was the day's most active issue.
By the time American equity markets opened yesterday, investors the world over had already spent most of the day generally selling shares, both in response to Motorola's news and the disappointing earnings estimate from Novell Inc., a computer software company, released on Friday night. The Novell report helped send the Nasdaq down 2.7 percent Monday while the Dow fell nine-tenths of 1 percent.
In addition, overseas investors turned skittish as further signs emerged of sluggish economic growth around the globe. In Hong Kong, stocks prices fell 1.4 percent; in Australia, where Rupert Murdoch, the chairman of the News Corporation, said earnings at the media company might have fallen in the September quarter, prices slipped a similar amount. Markets in Japan were closed for a national holiday.
European markets followed with one of their worst days of the year. The FT-SE 100, the bellwether London stock index, fell 1.4 percent following forecasts that the British budget deficit would be higher than expected. Stock prices experienced similar declines in Germany and in France. And in Finland, home of Nokia A.B., a cellular-phone maker that competes with Motorola, share prices plunged 4.7 percent.
"Things sort of came undone today," said Nicholas Knight, head of strategy at Nomura Research Institute Europe in London. "There is a general feeling that the economic and interest-rate environment through the end of the year is going to give Europe a very rough time, that it is going to be weaker than that of the U.S."
In the United States, though, investors repeated the pattern they followed after a sharp selloff in technology stocks in mid-July. Then, Microsoft and Intel warned Wall Street analysts not to be too optimistic with projections, leading to a two-day decline of more than 5 percent in the Nasdaq composite index.
But any investor who bought stocks at that time would be in the black since then. Even after yesterday's decline, the Nasdaq composite remained more than 3 percent ahead of its close on July 19, when the index recorded its largest one-day drop since 1987.
Investors can expect more such situations in coming days in American markets and overseas, analysts said. "We're going to see more volatility the rest of the month," said David Shulman, chief equity strategist at Salomon Brothers.
After seven quarters in which earnings exceeded expectations, "we're seeing something new to the market -- a lack of earnings momentum," he added. "But in order to have the weakness in technology stocks turn into a more general decline, the selloff will have to extend to the consumer and financial companies. That hasn't happened yet."
Technology stocks and the mutual funds that invest in them have taken a beating, though. In the last two sessions, funds that invest primarily in the shares of technology companies have fallen an average of 3.5 percent, according to Lipper Analytical Services. Among the biggest losers were the First American Technology fund, which slumped 5.4 percent, and the FMR Corporation's Fidelity Select Software fund, which declined 4.8 percent.
Several diversified equity funds that invest heavily in technology shares also fell sharply. Robertson Stephens & Company's Value and Growth fund, which earlier this year had as much as 70 percent of its assets in technology stocks, fell 4.3 percent in the two-day span. Navellier's Aggressive Small Cap Equity fund plunged 6.9 percent in value in the same stretch.
The Fidelity Magellan fund fell only 2.8 percent, equal to the two-day decline in the Nasdaq composite index. At the end of July, the most recent report available, the Magellan fund had 43 percent of its assets in technology stocks.
While buyers rushed into the market to support technology issues after their sharp fall, broader economic trends might continue to work against stocks.
Charles Clough, chief investment strategist at Merrill Lynch & Company, said that disappointing corporate earnings and declining profit margins were likely to hurt stocks enough to make bonds look more attractive for the rest of the year.
While the stock market is not suffering the sharp contraction in liquidity that occurred in 1987, Mr. Clough said stocks were likely to undergo a correction of about 10 percent between now and the year-end. At yesterday's close of 577.53, down 0.84 point, the Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks was just 1.6 percent below the recent high of 586.77 it reached on Sept. 20.

HEADLINE: G.O.P. Leaders Tell Clinton To Get Serious on the Budget

BYLINE: By ADAM CLYMER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 10

 BODY:
Republican leaders today demanded that President Clinton stop playing politics and negotiate seriously on the budget. If he does not, they threatened, they would pass their own bills and let him take the blame if he vetoes them and the Government shuts down.
"The White House doesn't quite get it yet," Speaker Newt Gingrich said. "The legislative branch has very legitimate prerogatives." 
 At a news conference, Mr. Gingrich and Senator Bob Dole of Kansas, the majority leader, repeatedly assailed Mr. Clinton's political tactics of accusing Republicans of reducing Medicare spending to pay for tax cuts. Mr. Gingrich said the President used "scare talks on Saturday morning to frighten 85-year-olds in order to get through the next election." Mr. Dole said, "He's just prepared to play politics every day."
But clearly the Republican attack had some underlying internal problems. The complaints about Mr. Clinton's sharp attacks suggested that those denunciations were getting through to voters, even though Mr. Gingrich contended "we are gradually winning the fight" for public opinion on Medicare. Mr. Dole acknowledged that "there are some Americans who don't think we are going to produce."
For his part, President Clinton today returned the accusation of a lack of good faith about negotiation. He said, "There are a lot of ways we can meet and talk together, but we don't need to get into a fight about it." He said, "My door is open and we'll walk through it." He also said, "It's not clear to me what is going on in Congress."
What appears to be going on is that each side thinks the other is displaying no give at all. Each side is hoping to sell the public on this view, so that if no budget agreement is reached, the other side will get the blame.
With less than five weeks to go until temporary spending authority approved by Congress last month expires, Republicans have been increasingly quarrelsome. Mr. Dole was criticized even by Mr. Gingrich for a suggestion 10 days ago that the promised $245 billion in tax cuts might not be delivered. And Republican conservatives in the House killed two spending measures despite leadership appeals that they act responsibility.
Today the Republicans claimed perfect unity in their party, but at the same time announced two moves designed to improve it. One is a steering committee of leaders from both houses that will meet daily on budget and spending measures. Tony Blankley, Mr. Gingrich's press secretary, said the purpose was to make sure that both chambers moved in as much harmony as possible, "so there will be no daylight between our shoulders." That would minimize problems in House-Senate conferences, another highly placed aide said. Congress is so far behind schedule that lengthy conferences could make it Congress's fault if deadlines are missed.
The other step was to postpone a markup on the budget reconciliation scheduled for Wednesday in the House. The purpose is to hold a party caucus, and in particular to permit moderates whose votes could sink the plan, to vent their unhappiness at ideologically pure but legislatively difficult proposals like oil drilling in the Arctic National WIldlife Refuge.
Some moderates have grumbled that there was no point in asking them to cast politically dangerous votes for provisions that leaders knew would have to be scrapped before the Senate would agree to them as part of a House-Senate compromise on the budget resolution.
And while White House aides gleefully put today's Republican display down to fear of the Republican right, it seemed just as likely that concessions would be made to moderates in order to get legislation to Mr. Clinton before the temporary spending measures expires on Nov. 12.
Mr. Clinton spoke before the Republican news conference. But Senator Tom Daschle of South Dakota, the minority leader, seized on the Republican tone at a later news conference.
He said he was confident that the Democrats were scoring with the argument that Republicans were cutting Medicare, the health care program for the elderly, in order to finance a tax cut. "It's not just the seniors who are scared," he said. "I think the Republicans are scared." Senator Bob Graham of Florida joined in, saying Republican rhetoric was being employed as a substitute for any answer as to why they were cutting Medicare $270 billion to make up a shortfall of $89 billion.
The tone was certainly sharp, about as harsh as Mr. Clinton has been employing against Republicans lately, as when he accused them on Sept. 30 of planning to install "a Medicaid police with vast power to seize your assets and put you out of your home and make sure you have nothing left to pass on to your children."
When Mr. Gingrich was asked about the President's suggestion that the two sides compromise on economic assumptions, he said that that amounted to saying, "Let's find one more excuse to lie to the American people."

HEADLINE: Upbeat White House Visit For the President of Mexico

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 10

 BODY:
The rescued came to thank the rescuer today, as President Ernesto Zedillo of Mexico met President Clinton for the first time since the Administration sidestepped Congress to bail out the Mexican economy. The two leaders declared that jobs and prosperity had been saved on both sides of the border.
Mr. Zedillo's visit was an effort to turn a political liability -- the perception among many Americans that closer economic ties with Mexico have brought more misery than profit -- into a celebration of the country's return to some semblance of financial stability. 
 Mr. Clinton praised Mr. Zedillo's "courage and determination" in keeping Mexican markets open to American goods despite huge political pressure at home to exclude foreign products at a time when a million Mexican workers have lost their jobs in a deep recession.
For his part Mr. Zedillo, who was feted at a state dinner tonight, praised his host's "vision and courage" for lending funds to Mexico over Congressional and public objections, saying that Mr. Clinton had prevented a systemic economic crisis "of world scope."
Beyond the mutual praise, a few concrete agreements were announced today. The two countries ended a long-running dispute over the labeling and inspection of tires made in Mexico by American manufacturers, and the United States announced $70 million in financing from the Export-Import Bank to allow Mexico to purchase radar equipment for anti-narcotics operations.
But two other major trade disputes remain unresolved, despite last minute efforts before Mr. Zedillo's arrival: Mexico's refusal to speed up a reduction in tariffs on wine imports, and a continuing dispute with the United Parcel Service over its desire to use large trucks on Mexican roads.
But today was hardly a day when either side wanted to dwell on problems. Mr. Clinton made the case that the $12.5 billion loaned to Mexico -- another $7.5 billion was promised but will probably not be necessary -- profited both nations.
The United States Treasury has already received roughly $470 million in interest, in addition to an early repayment of principal on the loan, which Mr. Zedillo engineered last week by floating a bond issue on the private markets, a step that would have been impossible when the country seemed a far larger risk in the spring.
Responding to conservative critics like Patrick J. Buchanan and liberal opponents of the bailout like Ralph Nader, Administration officials have argued in recent days that their emergency loan program also succeeded in stemming far worse economic disruption and a surge of illegal immigration across the border.
"A strong, democratic Mexico will be an even more effective partner in the struggle against drugs and crime and pollution," Mr. Clinton said at a news conference at the White House.
But as Mr. Clinton's advisers have conceded privately in recent weeks, even the most favorable statistics, including the Administration's somewhat optimistic estimate that 340,000 jobs have been created as a result of the North American Free Trade Agreement, cannot shake the perception that the free trade accord and the bailout have yielded few benefits for American workers. And that, in turn, has fed into the broader political problem of an American work force seized by insecurity.
"This is a tricky political problem for the President," one of his close economic advisers said recently. "We were doing fine until the peso crisis. You could make a credible case that the Nafta was benefiting us. But now you get an earful wherever you go."
Even if Mexico resumes strong economic growth, however, it is unlikely that the Mexican market will become an engine of growth for American exports before the Presidential election. That has far more to do with the depth of Mexico's recession than with the trade accord itself. But in the public mind, the trade accord and the bailout are fused into one, and that has dampened any political enthusiasm for Mr. Clinton's biggest free trade initiative.
"Nafta has become a mirror for our political dilemma over trade," said Jeffrey E. Garten, the Undersecretary of Commerce for international trade. "While many gain, others lose, and the losers are much more visible."
Such realities have frustrated many of Mr. Clinton's closest aides. "There is a fiction around that U.S. personal income has gone down since Nafta was enacted; in fact, it has gone up," said Mickey Kantor, the United States trade representative. "Our share of imports in the Mexican market has gone up. Our total exports to Mexico are above what they were in 1993, despite the recession there. And it would have been an even greater success had it not been for the peso crisis."
Nevertheless, Mr. Buchanan, the most overtly anti-free-trader of the Republicans seeking the presidential nomination, wins huge applause whenever he makes the point that the United States' $2 billion trade surplus with Mexico has turned into a $15 billion trade deficit this year.
Mr. Zedillo dwelled on none of that today. Instead, he offered assurances that his administration would continue to fight drug trafficking and would attempt an experimental program of "repatriating" illegal immigrants caught in the United States, sending those who volunteer back to their hometowns rather than letting them sit on the southern side of the border, where they are likely to attempt another illegal crossing.
But most of all, Mr. Zedillo promised to continue his austerity program, the chief requirement American officials placed on his country in return for the loans.
"I am fully confident that we are going to achieve our growth goal," Mr. Zedillo said to Mr. Clinton today, "because throughout history the Mexican people have risen to the challenges and proven that we are capable of great achievements."

HEADLINE: Unlikely Allies Battle Congress Over Anti-Immigration Plans

BYLINE: By MATTHEW PURDY 

 BODY:
As Congress today considers some of the most severe anti-immigration measures since the 1920's, it is facing resistance from a surprising alliance of high-technology manufacturers, religious leaders, conservative think tanks, civil liberties organizations and tiny, grass-roots immigrant groups.
From Microsoft, which is fighting limitations on visas for foreign computer scientists, to the Roman Catholic Church, which is battling for the rights of political refugees, the coalition is giving some heft to the loosely organized opposition by immigrants, who belatedly realized that the mood of the country had turned against them. 
 "There's a wide array of groups that think the legal immigration system is not broken and doesn't need radical changes," said Ira Rubinstein, a senior lawyer for Microsoft.
It is a loose alliance, and each group has its own concerns with the Omnibus Immigration Bill, which is to be taken up by the House Judiciary Committee today, as well as with similar proposals in the Senate. In New York City, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani has sided with the proposal's opponents and against many Republican leaders nationally.
The diversity of the opposition reflects the broad sweep of the various Congressional proposals, which began as an attack on illegal immigration and were broadened to restrict legal immigration as well.
Manufacturers, insistent that they need foreigners with special skills to remain competitive, oppose attempts to limit visas used by United States companies to hire foreign engineers, computer programmers and scientists. Ethnic groups in cities across the country denounce a proposal that would cut the annual level of legal immigration by 30 percent and restrict their rights to bring their foreign relatives here. Church organizations and immigration lawyers oppose pending cuts in the number of refugees and the rights of people seeking political asylum.
And a proposed national computer system to enable employers to check the legal status of prospective workers has drawn opposition both from civil liberties groups, who fear it would lead to discrimination, and from anti-regulation libertarians and business groups, who see it as an expensive and invasive growth of government.
"Most of these groups have never worked together before," said Rick Swartz, a lawyer who started the National Immigration Forum and is instrumental in the current coalition. "Some of them may have found this difficult to imagine a year ago."
These groups do not speak with a single voice, nor do they have a single agenda. But the cumulative effect of their activities is expanding what was a one-sided debate about how immigrants are draining the American economy to include at least some emphasis on the role of immigrants in helping the country stay competitive in the global economy and in restoring forgotten inner-city neighborhoods.
While it is unclear whether they are having any impact beyond that, the opponents of the new restrictions seem to have pushed the Judiciary Committee to consider splitting the omnibus bill into two, one focusing on illegal immigration and the other on legal.
Representatives have been lobbied from all sides. Both the Massachusetts Immigration and Refugee Advocacy Coalition and Reebok International, the shoe company, have lobbied Representative Barney Frank, a Democrat of Massachusetts who serves on the Judiciary Committee. The National Association of Manufacturers, Intel and the Cato Institute, a conservative study group in Washington, have lobbied Representative Lamar Smith, a Republican of Texas whose legislation contains the strong restrictions.
The most interesting union is between traditionally liberal immigration groups and pro-growth, free-trade conservative organizations, which defend immigration as a matter of principle and espouse the virtues of most immigrants. They have always agreed on the benefits of immigration, but rarely allied themselves publicly.
Steve Moore, an economist with the Cato Institute, called the restrictive proposals "anti-business, anti-family, anti-freedom."
And Luis A. Miranda Jr., the president of the Hispanic Federation of New York, said, "Unless we begin to educate the general public that immigrants don't make the cities and country worse, people see lack of employment, lack of opportunity and think we should close the door."
In June, President Clinton endorsed a recommendation of the Federal Commission on Immigration Reform to cut legal immigration by one-third. Dick Day, the chief counsel to the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Immigration, said the alliance fighting the proposals was "Washington groups and on the other side are the American people" who have asked for "some breathing space" from immigration. The subcommittee is led by Senator Alan K. Simpson, a Republican of Wyoming who is a chief proponent of the restrictive measures.
Representative Smith has said that opponents have overstated his bill's effect on both family members and skilled workers and that he was responding to a national consensus that legal immigration should be reformed.
John L. Martin, the research director of the Center for Immigration Studies, which supports the restrictive measures, said the opponents were "the very liberal element that is in favor of diversity in the country, business interests that benefit from a free flow of labor and people who simply don't like big government." He said the lobbying had led some members of Congress "to water down some of the proposals."
Opposition to the proposals has just recently been organized, two years after the anti-immigration movement began gathering steam behind California's Proposition 187, which bars illegal immigrants from public education and other benefits. California voters approved it overwhelmingly in November 1994.
"I think we are at the beginning of a pretty ferocious debate about the role of immigrants: Do we still want to be a nation of immigrants or do we want to throw up the walls and say 'No More'?" asked Frank Sharry, the executive director of the National Immigration Forum.
Pope John Paul II, during his United States visit last week, warned of the threats to the country's tradition of welcoming immigrants, a theme already sounded by the National Council of Catholic Bishops.
The anti-immigrant sentiment has created a sense of siege among immigrants, unifying ethnic groups that often exist in parallel worlds and stirring political activity in organizations initially established to serve the more basic housing and economic needs of immigrants.
"If you're a new immigrant, you're trying to hold down three or four jobs and get your kids in school," said Marjie McHugh, executive director of the New York Immigration Coalition. "There has not been time for political organizing. But because of what's been going on nationally in terms of the debate, it's speeding up that process."
The strength of the activism by immigrants and business leaders was demonstrated last month when, on one day, about 300 immigrants went to Washington to lobby members of Congress against restricting the immigration of family members. The next day, representatives of 65 companies organized by the National Association of Manufacturers and the American Immigration Lawyers Association showed up to make similar arguments against imposing restrictions on visas for skilled and professional workers.
Mr. Rubinstein, of Microsoft, disputed the contention that foreign workers were taking corporate jobs from Americans. He said that 25 percent of the job openings his company had last year -- about 1,000 positions -- remained vacant because qualified people could not be found, either here or abroad.
Last month, the National Immigration Forum held a series of news conferences in major cities to release a study titled "Together In Our Differences," profiling immigrant enterprises working to rebuild poor city neighborhoods.
The strong presence of business has added a new dimension to the issue, said Austin T. Fragomen, a New York lawyer who represents such companies as I.B.M., Procter & Gamble and Walt Disney. All three are concerned about how the proposals would restrict their freedom to hire foreign workers for jobs in the United States.
"When Congressmen think of immigration, they typically think of the Polish-American Alliance coming to beat up on them," Mr. Fragomen said. "They never had any idea business was interested in immigration."

HEADLINE: Opponents of Gay Topics Press Crusade

BYLINE: By DAVID W. DUNLAP

 BODY:
Buoyed by fresh victories at local school boards in New Hampshire and Iowa, conservatives who believe that homosexual topics have no place in public-school curriculums are preparing to make their case to Congress.
A 34-year-old English teacher at a rural New Hampshire high school, Penny J. Culliton, was dismissed last month for insubordination because she had distributed novels, without school board approval, that depicted gay and lesbian characters. One was "Maurice" by E. M. Forster. 
 Two weeks earlier, Jonathan C. Wilson was defeated for re-election to the Des Moines school board, after having served 12 years. In a debate in January on gay and lesbian topics in the curriculum, Mr. Wilson, a 50-year-old father of two, publicly disclosed his homosexuality.
The Rev. Louis P. Sheldon, chairman of a nationwide church network called the Traditional Values Coalition, said he was "very much encouraged" by these developments. Mr. Sheldon and other conservative leaders oppose Federal aid to school districts in which there are gay and lesbian programs. They are marshaling witnesses for a Congressional hearing this fall.
Conservatives worry that teaching homosexual issues, themes and characters, particularly in a positive light, can sway students toward homosexuality at a vulnerable time. They also say parents are denied a voice in deciding how much their children should learn about such a divisive subject.
Mr. Sheldon said the introduction of such topics amounted to "parental rights being denied at the classroom level while Federal dollars, through different agencies, are used to promote and advocate the homosexual life style."
On the other side are those who maintain that all students benefit from lessons in diversity and acceptance of others, while homosexual and bisexual youths benefit especially from learning that they are not isolated, either culturally or historically. Advocates suggest this may inculcate a self-esteem that can carry a gay or lesbian teen-ager through suicidal despondency.
"They need to know that there are gay and lesbian people in history," said Jean Genasci, a vice president of Parents, Families and Friends of Lesbians and Gays. "They need to know that they're O.K. as people. They have a right to feel safe in schools."
The Congressional hearing is to be held by an Economic and Educational Opportunities subcommittee. Representative Peter Hoekstra, Republican of Michigan, is the subcommittee chairman.
Although the hearing has been criticized as a tax-financed platform for Mr. Sheldon's views, Mr. Hoekstra's press secretary, Jon P. Brandt, said the panel would hear from all sides.
It was three years ago that the battle over the curriculum on diversity, the "Children of the Rainbow," erupted in New York City. Such fights have now reached rural areas like the Mascenic Regional School District in New Hampshire, about 25 miles southwest of Manchester.
That is where the board dismissed Ms. Culliton for distributing "Maurice" to seniors and "The Education of Harriet Hatfield," by May Sarton, to juniors. The books had been bought with a grant awarded for projects that focus on the needs of gay and lesbian youths.
Ms. Culliton said she chose those works because "each of them shows gay and lesbian people going about their lives, not perpetuating the usual stereotypes we see in literature, that if you're gay you must be psychotic or a child molester or promiscuous or alcoholic."
When she handed out the books last spring, Ms. Culliton had not been authorized to do so by the board. She said it had never before been the board's policy to require approval for anything except textbooks. But the board said that "thematically sensitive materials" were subject to special consideration and that Ms. Culliton's actions amounted to "willful insubordination."
The board emphasized that professional conduct was the issue, not anti-gay bias. "It definitely is not homophobia," said Steven B. Lizotte, the chairman.
Ms. Culliton disagreed, as did her union, the National Education Association. "If these books were about any other subject than homosexuality, Penny Culliton would not have been fired," said Dennis Murphy, public affairs director for the union in New Hampshire.
Ms. Culliton said she hoped to win her job back through arbitration. The day after her dismissal was announced, 40 students held a protest demonstration. "I think we can handle reading a book," said Amy Malboeuf, a sophomore.
In Des Moines, a curriculum fight exploded when a list was made public of an advisory committee's recommendations on how homosexual issues might be "thoughtfully infused in the educational program." The recommendations included a "discussion of how homophobia impacted the governmental response to H.I.V. disease" and "information on the Stonewall riots."
In the ensuing debate, Mr. Wilson disclosed he is gay, saying he did it so opponents could not use rumors of his homosexuality as a weapon. He had served on the seven-member Des Moines board since 1983, for three terms as president and two as vice president.
"We should defer to mom and dad and churches on the right and wrong of homosexuality," Mr. Wilson said. "But with respect to tolerance, respect and discrimination, even though we have kids coming to school thinking it's O.K. to discriminate, the schools should teach otherwise."
A leader in the fight against the curriculum and Mr. Wilson's re-election was Bill Horn, the Midwest regional director of the Report, a group that reports instances and evidence of what it calls the "gay agenda," which is also the title of a videotape it distributes.
"We want respect and tolerance for all students -- period," Mr. Horn said. "You don't have to single out homosexual students. There are more overweight people than gay people but we don't have classes on the historical contributions of overweight people."
Mr. Horn's efforts were endorsed by Senator Phil Gramm of Texas, a candidate for the Republican Presidential nomination. "Thank God for Bill and the thousands of parents who would not be intimidated by the liberal media or the radical homosexual community," Mr. Gramm declared in a letter to Iowa voters just before a straw poll in August.
Mr. Wilson said he raised $60,000, an extraordinary sum for a school board race, and "was still outspent by my detractors by about 2 to 1." On Sept. 12, nearly 30,000 voters cast ballots, more than four times the normal turnout. Mr. Wilson placed last in a field of four candidates for two seats.
"We're dealing with a new phase in the evolution of the radical right," Mr. Wilson said, "because now they have demonstrated their confidence in their ability to turn out voters who'll march in lockstep, or perhaps I should say goose step.
"Even my detractors knew I was the best qualified candidate. They all know that the reason this person didn't get the job was solely and exclusively because he was a gay man."
But Mr. Horn said Mr. Wilson had only himself to blame. "He wasn't defeated because he was homosexual," Mr. Horn said. "He was defeated because he became a homosexual activist."
Dan Woog, author of "School's Out: The Impact of Gay and Lesbian Issues on America's Schools" (Alyson Publications, 1995), said he saw benefits from the Culliton and Wilson cases.
"When I was in school in the mid-70's," Mr. Woog said, "the 'G' and 'L' words were never spoken. Now they're being talked about, even if negatively. Kids are recognizing they're not alone. They're learning that people are out there fighting for them."

World Bank Chief Backs Public Projects

BYLINE: By PAUL LEWIS 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 10

 BODY:
The new president of the World Bank, James D. Wolfensohn, said today that he wanted the institution to do more to encourage private investment in developing countries, but that it would also continue to back large public projects.
He also again criticized Congress for planning sharp cuts in the United States' contribution to the International Development Association, the World Bank's agency that helps poor countries; he warned that American companies could be excluded from overseas contracts as a result. 
 Speaking to world finance ministers here, Mr. Wolfensohn said the World Bank would increase its efforts to help developing countries "attract private and public investment in high-quality projects."
These would include "helping governments strengthen their business regulatory and financial systems in order to provide the assurance to private investors that they will have no nasty surprises in carrying out their plans," he said.
But Mr. Wolfensohn made clear that he still saw an important role for the World Bank in its traditional business of financing large public projects despite his recent decision to cancel a $1 billion dam in Nepal.
The institution's "original genius remains as valid, if not more valid, today than it was five decades ago," he said, referring to the developing world's need for power plants, ports and roads -- especially in the fast-growing economies of Asia.
Some of those who heard Mr. Wolfensohn today, in his first address to members of the World Bank, were disappointed that he did not offer a more sweeping vision of the bank's future. President Clinton's choice of Mr. Wolfensohn, a 61-year-old investment banker, had raised expectations that he could revitalize the international development effort much as Robert McNamara did when he took over the World Bank in 1968.
In addition to his criticism of planned Congressional cuts in financing for the World Bank, Mr. Wolfensohn said that American corporations as well as the poor would both lose if Congress enacts the cuts later this week.
At a news conference before his address, he said that if other countries made up the expected shortfall in the American contribution to the International Development Association this year, they would probably try to bar American corporations from bidding for the dams and other projects the money would finance.
"I'm not sure they will put in the money," he said. "But if they do, they will seek to exclude the U.S. from benefiting from the funds."

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Treasuries Are Mostly Down in Price

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
After a three-day weekend, Treasury prices ended generally lower yesterday.
But prices of short-term maturities rose, benefiting from investors fleeing the turmoil in the stock market for more security. 
 The price of the 30-year bond fell 9/32, to 105 24/32. Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from its price, rose to 6.44 percent, from 6.42 percent on Friday. The cash market for Treasury securities was closed on Monday in observance of Columbus Day.
But the price of the three-month bill rose, with its rate falling a basis point, to 5.28 percent. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. The rate on the six-month bill was unchanged at 5.33 percent.
Traders said some market participants initially held back in the early going to see how the stock market would perform at the opening, after the battering it took on Monday. Investors did not have to wait long as the Dow Jones industrial average sank nearly 66 points within the first 15 minutes. The Dow later recovered, ending down 5.42 points for the day.
Matthew F. Alexy, chief market strategist at CS First Boston in New York, said prices were largely stuck in a trading range yesterday. "Earlier weakness in stocks prompted a positive bond market response," he said, "and after equities settled down, so did bonds."
Hugh A. Johnson, chief investment strategist and director at First Albany Corporation, said: "The most important help to bonds today, has been the disarray in stocks. And many investors have shifted from stocks in general, and technology issues in particular, into safe havens, such as utility stocks and bonds."
Mr. Alexy said he expected that the market would maintain its narrow trading patterns. "The only risk for the market is that it is being left to its own devices," he said. "Most people are content in waiting for new information rather than speculating ahead of it."
It was the same in futures trading yesterday, he said. The futures market, which strongly affects the cash market is "sort of bidding its time," he said. The December bond contract hit a new contract high at 116 on technical buying yesterday, about the time stocks were way down.
There were signs of buying in the five-year and 10-year maturities, and as the December 10-year approached a 6 percent equivalent cash yield there was speculation that a rise above that level could prompt more buying in Treasury securities and selling in mortgages. Companies holding mortgages might seek to extend the duration of portfolios and look for protection against the risk of mortgages' prepayment if interest rates continued to fall.
The December bond contract, whose high price was 116, closed at 115 21/32.
In the cash market, bond prices received some support from two reports showing retail sales weakening. The Johnson Redbook Service's survey for the first week of October showed a decline of 1.2 percent, while a weekly report on chain-store sales from Mitsubishi Bank Ltd. and Schroder Wertheim & Company showed a decline of three-tenths of 1 percent.
"There are still ongoing worries about the economy which are providing the support to bonds," Mr. Johnson of First Albany said.
The employment report released on Friday did little to change the market's view that the economy is enjoying moderate growth and low inflation. But important price reports are due out this week, which could shed more light on the direction of interest rates. Data on producer prices in September will come out tomorrow, and reports on consumer prices and retail sales will be released on Friday.
"A lot of this is all about waiting," Mr. Johnson said, "with producer prices on Thursday and consumer prices and monthly retail sales on Friday."
Because of the Columbus Day holiday, the Treasury delayed until yesterday the auction of new three- and six-month bills.
Bill rates at auction declined to three-week lows, with the three-month bills down 3 basis points, to 5.31 percent, and the six-month rate down 6 basis points, to 5.32 percent.
Tomorrow, the Treasury plans to sell $18.25 billion of new one-year bills. The rate for a one-year bill yesterday was 5.29 percent, up a basis point.
Following are the results of yesterday's Treasury auction of new three- and six-month bills:
 
(000 omitted in dollar figures)

 	 	 		3-Mo. Bills	6-Mo. Bills	Average Price	98.658	97.310	Discounted Rate	5.31%	5.32%	Coupon Yield	5.47%	5.56%	High Price	98.663	97.326	Discounted Rate	5.29%	5.29%	Coupon Yield	5.45%	5.53%	Low Price	98.658	97.310	Discounted Rate	5.31%	5.32%	Coupon Yield	5.47%	5.56%	Accepted at low price	43%	69%	Total applied for	$45,105,700	$41,683,737	Accepted	$13,102,014	$13,094,653	Noncompetitive	$1,488,107	$1,324,355	

Both issues are dated Oct. 12, 1995. The three-month bills mature on Jan. 11, 1996, and the six-month bills mature on April 11, 1996.

HEADLINE: A Nobel Award for a University of Chicago Economist, Yet Again

BYLINE: By PETER PASSELL 

 BODY:
Robert E. Lucas Jr., a 58-year-old professor at the University of Chicago, was awarded the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Science yesterday -- the fifth winner in economics from the University of Chicago in the last six years.
In enumerating Professor Lucas's achievements, the Swedish Royal Academy of Sciences said that he was "the economist who has had the greatest influence on macroeconomic research since 1970." 
 That assessment squares with the views of his peers, even those who disagree with many of his views on policy issues. "Lucas deserves the recognition," said James Tobin of Yale University, the winner of the prize in 1981. "He changed the methodology of the profession," forcing a more disciplined look at the assumptions about human behavior that underlie economic models, Mr. Tobin said.
Mr. Lucas helped lead a shift in the profession away from the government interventionist approach identified with John Maynard Keynes and toward a more skeptical attitude about the ability of government policy makers to fine-tune the economy. And he thinks that the change has paid off.
"The U.S. economy is in excellent shape," Mr. Lucas said at a news conference in Chicago yesterday. "The Government is not trying to do things with economic policy that it isn't capable of doing."
Mr. Lucas holds a bachelor's degree (in history) and a doctorate (in economics) from the University of Chicago. He spent the first decade of his career as a teacher at Carnegie-Mellon University in Pittsburgh and returned to the University of Chicago's department of economics in 1974, where, save for a brief stint as a visiting professor at Northwestern University in 1981, he has been ever since.
His path-breaking work is best understood in the context of its times. Once a field without clear demarcations, economics diverged in the 1920's and 1930's into microeconomics, the study of markets, and macroeconomics, the analysis of whole economies. By the late 1960's, microeconomic theory was painstakingly erected on an edifice of clear assumptions, with only incidental application to real world problems.
Macroeconomics, by contrast, was cast in the crucible of the Depression. A simple theoretical framework, accessible to any bright undergraduate, rationalized the use of government fiscal and monetary tools to tame the ups and downs -- particularly the downs -- of the business cycle. It was assumed to be correct largely because it seemed to work, not because it had been constructed from universally accepted first principles. And while its senior practitioners were certainly able scholars, they were primarily hands-on problem solvers.
Mr. Lucas went back to basics, asking how people would act in maximizing their own interests in the face of changing government policies. And the more closely he looked, the less plausible it seemed that individuals would play by the Keynesian rules.
Take, for example, the impact of monetary policy on business activity. Keynesians assumed that a cut in interest rates would stimulate demand for a wide variety of products, increasing overall business activity. Building on the earlier research of John Muth, who asked how farmers would incorporate knowledge of past prices and costs to generate future plans, Mr. Lucas focused on the impact of monetary stimulus on a single producer of, say, thingamabobs.
The immediate, positive impact on demand for thingamabobs would lead to an increase in their market price, probably convincing the producer to increase output and hire more workers. But the monetary jolt would presumably have the same effect on thousands of other products, raising the cost of producing thingamabobs more or less in proportion to the increase in potential revenue from their sales.
The only way monetary policy can work, Mr. Lucas concluded, is to mislead in systematic ways. But if producers are rational, they will learn from the error of assuming that the price of thingamabobs will go up more than the costs. Indeed, he theorized, after enough learning from changing government policies, the impact of monetary stimulus ceases to be predictable: the residual impact comes from unanticipated effects, which can even be the opposite of what policy makers intend.
"Lucas was smart," said N. Gregory Mankiw, an economist at Harvard University. The incorporation of "rational expectations" in macroeconomic theory was just too good an idea to ignore. "But Lucas was also lucky," Mr. Mankiw added, because the ideas came along in the mid-1970's, when the world was open to new concepts just as policy makers were losing confidence in Keynesian fine-tuning.
Indeed, Mr. Lucas is reluctant to toot his own horn. Unlike most leaders of the economics profession, he spends little time offering advice to politicians or second-guessing them in print. And in a telephone interview after winning the Nobel prize he was quick to share the credit for rational expectations theory with others. "Ed Prescott and Tom Sargent applied the ideas at about the same time," he said, referring to former colleagues at the University of Chicago.
Mr. Lucas also acknowledged disappointment that his work had done more to wreck the credibility of Keynesian prescriptions than to create replacements for the old rules -- a disappointment shared by many economists. To get solid results from rational expectations models of economic behavior, Mr. Tobin said, "you have to specify who knows what when" -- an overwhelming task in a complex economy.
What everyone agrees, however, is that Mr. Lucas remains one of the most inventive economic minds at a university that can also boast of Nobel prizes in economics for Robert W. Fogel (1993), Gary S. Becker (1992), Ronald H. Coase (1991), Merton H. Miller (1990), George J. Stigler (1982), Theodore W. Schultz (1979) and Milton Friedman (1976).Indeed, Mr. Lucas may become the first economist to win two Nobel prizes: His later work on the forces driving economic development has helped generate an avalanche of research in what is now called the "new growth theory."

HEADLINE: All a Matter of Perspective

BYLINE: By STEVEN A. HOLMES 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 10

 BODY:
To Ronald and Bridgette Lathern, Nationsbank is guilty of racial discrimination, a biased lender that unfairly rejected their mortgage application because they are black. That rejection, they said, caused them to miss out on the tidy three-bedroom home in suburban Maryland they had their hearts set on.
"We had high hopes, and to be turned down like that was the worst thing," Mr. Lathern said. "The first thing I felt was that as a black man, they just don't give us a break." 
 John Taylor has a very different view. Mr. Taylor, president of the National Community Reinvestment Coalition, acknowledges that Nationsbank -- America's fourth-largest bank -- may have treated minorities unfairly on occasion, but he notes that it is still considered an industry leader in lending in minority and low-income neighborhoods. In fact, the bank has fought efforts by Republican to weaken a Federal law meant to encourage such loans.
The two views -- some say two faces -- of Nationsbank have been highlighted by a lawsuit filed last month, accusing the bank, which is based in Charlotte, N.C., of violating Federal anti-discrimination laws in its mortgage lending in the Washington area.
Lawyers for the plaintiffs argue that no matter what the bank's overall record is, their clients were treated unfairly. Oficials at Nationsbank say that figures alone give a distorted picture, since lenders that aggressively seek to make loans in low-income and minority neighborhoods -- as Nationsbank has -- can end up denying loans to more people.
"They stuck their neck out at the risk of it getting chopped off by others in their industry," said Mr. Taylor, whose group represents housing and community groups seeking to encourage investments in minority and low-income areas.
The truth may lie somewhere in between. "They may not be the Mother Teresa of banking, but they are far from the Mark Fuhrman of banking," said Kenneth Thomas, an independent consultant based in Miami. "These are not the bad ones they should be going after. There are many other banks, usually small banks, that are much worse."
The Nationsbank case highlights a broader issue in banking. One difficulty in trying to sort this out is that the only way to gauge bias in the industry -- which is a vexing, continuing problem across the nation -- is by looking at statistics that banks have been required to provide to the Government since 1990. In conflicts, each side tends to provide numbers that bolster its particular legal point.
The class action suit filed by the Washington Lawyers Committee for Civil Rights and Urban Affairs on behalf of 11 African-American plaintiffs -- including the Latherns -- may be a harbinger of things to come, experts in the field say.
Starting under President George Bush, the Justice Department reached out-of-court settlements with a number of banks that it accused of showing bias in lending. The 1990 law requiring deposit-taking institutions and mortgage companies to report approval and denial rates for loans by sex, income and race has provided civil rights and fair- housing groups with fertile statistical grounds to bolster their claims.
The action against Nationsbank is the first lawsuit filed by either the Government or a private organization accusing a major bank of lending discrimination.
"This is the second wave, a new era where the private sector is beginning to pick up these cases," said John P. Relman, a lawyer for the plaintiffs who is also director of the Fair Housing Project at the Lawyers Committee. "I don't think it's going to matter so much any more who is in the White House and what is politically going on in the Justice Department because the private sector will bring these cases."
The suit contends that among other things, Nationsbank refused to give African-American applicants a fair chance to provide an explanation if they have poor credit histories -- an opportunity, the suit states, that whites are normally given. It also maintains that the bank required blacks to meet unnecessarily high standards to qualify for loans -- often higher than what is required by those who repurchase mortgages in the secondary market -- and failed to offer black applicants advice on how to lower their monthly debt to qualify for mortgage loans.
Lawyers for the Lawyers Committee seek to bolster their claim that the 11 black plaintiffs were treated unfairly by citing statistics indicating that at Nationsbank in Washington black applicants were turned down at a rate five times that of whites. That, the lawyers say, is the largest racial disparity of any bank among institutions that received at least 400 mortgage applications in the Washington area.
The lawyers also assert that while 10.2 percent of African-American applicants were rejected for poor credit histories, fewer than 1 percent of whites were; again, the largest disparity of any lender in the area.
Lawyers for the plaintiffs say the large disparity in rejections occurred regardless of income group and despite the fact that many lower-income blacks seeking loans from Nationsbank were pre-screened for credit problems by a community group before applying to the bank.
Nationsbank officials deny the accusations and vow to fight the case in court. They argue that looking at disparities alone does not take into account factors like the state of a local economy and housing stock. "We may have more strikeouts, but over all we're going to make a lot more loans than anybody else, because we go to bat a lot more times," said Cathy Bessant, senior vice president for Nationsbank.
With assets of more than $170 billion, Nationsbank is notable for its size -- it has grown rapidly through acquisitions in recent years -- but also for its image as a relative paragon of corporate responsibility. Its chairman, Hugh L. McColl, has given speeches defending affirmative action. It has pledged to lend $10 billion over a 10-year period in minority communities. And it has sponsored conferences to help grass-roots organizations and housing advocacy groups devise ways to draw more capital into poorer neighborhoods.
Earlier this year, Nationsbank officials testified against changes proposed by some Republican lawmakers that would have weakened the Community Reinvestment Act, a measure that seeks to encourage investment in low- and moderate-income neighborhoods by linking approval of a bank's mergers and acquisitions to its lending record in all communities where it operates. The effort to change the law was eventually defeated in the Senate.
In January, the National Community Investment Coalition released a study of lending activity in the country's 20 largest cities and it gave Nationsbank relatively good marks for the way it marketed, approved or denied loans to minority communities. The study did, however, point out that of all the markets in which Nationsbank operated, its Washington operation had the worst record.
Officials at Nationsbank, which needs a good public image if it wants to keep up its rapid expansion through mergers, have not been shy in pointing out their record as they try to rally grass-roots support among housing and community development advocates. And they are also not shy about pointing out what they see as one possible consequence of the lawsuit.
"One of my big concerns about this case is that it will discourage other lenders from being as aggressive as they might have been," Ms. Bessant said in a telephone interview from the bank's corporate headquarters. "This lawsuit says, 'Don't be aggressive, because if you're aggressive we'll come after you.' "
But Mr. Relman counters that whatever Nationsbank's record in Congress defending the Community Reinvestment Act or the number of mortgages it approves in minority areas around the country, it still treated his 11 plaintiffs unfairly and should be held responsible.
"The question is: Are they immunized from judicial scrutiny and should we not be protecting and advocating rights of people?" Mr. Relman said. "Should we turn a blind eye because this bank has people who stand on the Hill and defend C.R.A.?"
The Latherns certainly don't think so.
Mr. Lathern said Nationsbank loan officers turned him and his wife down in March 1994 because his wife was late on three payments on her Sears credit card. He said the officers did not give them a chance to explain the late payments and refused to consider solely Mr. Lathern's credit history, which he said was flawless.
Mr. Lathern, a mailroom supervisor at the Federal Trade Commission, said he earned enough to qualify for the mortgage without counting his wife's income.
Three months later, the Latherns bought another house, also in suburban Maryland. This time, a different bank also questioned his wife's late payments. But after she wrote a letter explaining that she had been short of cash after helping to pay funeral expenses from two deaths in her family, the bank approved their application.
The second house, unlike the first, needed fixing up and was not in as pretty a neighborhood, the Latherns said. And interest rates had risen in the interim, so they were not able to get as good a deal on their loan.
"The first house had a lot more features," Mr. Lathern said. "It was in better shape. That was the house that we wanted to get. It was tailor-made."

THE PLANTIFFS SAY
 Nationsbank discriminates against black mortgage applicants in the Washington area. The bank rejected 17.5 percent of its black applicants from 1990 to 1993, compared with 3.3 percent of its white applicants. Black applicants were not given the same chance to defend their credit histories.
 "To be turned down like that was the worst thing. The first thing I felt was that as a black man, they just don't give us a break." -- RONALD LATHERN, with wife, Bridgette and son, Ronald Jr. (Karin Anderson for The New York Times)
 
THE BANK SAYS
 It aggressively seeks to make loans in low-income and minority neighborhoods, which results in more rejected applications. The bank extended nearly twice as many loans to Washington-area blacks in 1994 as it did two years earlier, even as the number of loans to whites declined by 42 percent. Across the nation, the bank extends loans to blacks at more than twice the proportion of the average bank.

HEADLINE: Susan F. Glass, 60, A Selective Publicist

 BODY:
Susan F. Glass, a highly particular public relations woman who made a career being paid for advancing causes she believed in, died on Friday at her home in Manhattan. She was 60, and until she went on medical leave at the end of 1994, she was a senior vice president of the Urban Development Corporation.
The cause was lung cancer, her friend Sandy Silverman said. 
 Whether she was writing speeches for Dore Schary at the Anti-Defamation League, editing Albert Shanker's newspaper columns for the United Federation of Teachers or, more recently, advancing her friend Mario M. Cuomo's economic development programs at the U.D.C., Ms. Glass pursued her work with a passion that seemed to go far beyond her professional obligations.
That, her friends say, was because Ms. Glass, a fierce supporter of Democratic politicians from Robert F. Kennedy to Mr. Cuomo, was such an intense idealist that she made a point of working only for those institutions she deemed worthy of her passions.
Ms. Glass was born in Richmond Hill, Queens, graduated from Queens College and received a master's degree in English from New York University. She began her career at the old Long Island Press, working as women's news editor before shifting to public relations.
She is survived by a brother, Michael, of Miami.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Edges Up, Yielding Most Of Its Early Gains Against Mark

BYLINE: By Reuters 

 BODY:
The dollar ended little changed yesterday, giving up gains in Europe after stocks fell for a second consecutive day in the United States and fresh concerns arose over Mexico's economic health.
The currency made modest progress in Europe overnight against the German mark as the mark's rally against the French franc stalled. But a lack of follow-through buying in New York caused the dollar to retest the day's lows. 
 Traders expect tight dollar ranges to continue. "The dollar remains in a choppy range and we expect more of the same this week," said Philip Vasan, managing director for foreign-exchange derivatives at CS First Boston.
Weakness in the stock market also put pressure on the dollar, as the Dow Jones industrial average plummeted in early trading after falling 42.99 points on Monday.
In New York trading late yesterday, the dollar rose to 100.88 Japanese yen from 100.43 yen on Monday. It rose to 1.4184 marks from 1.4124 and to 1.1485 Swiss francs from 1.1425 Swiss francs.
The Mexican peso unnerved dollar holders yesterday as the peso fell as much as 4.2 percent. The collapse of the peso last winter had dragged down the dollar because of the close economic ties between the United States and Mexico.
But Mexican financial weakness is not as threatening to the dollar as it was last winter, according to some traders, including Mr. Vasan of CS First Boston, who said, "Overseas holdings of Mexican assets are not as large as they used to be."
The peso settled at 6.7450 to the dollar yesterday, weaker than the rate of 6.6500 to the dollar late Monday.
The reversal of the mark's sharp climb against the French franc helped support the dollar versus the mark overnight, traders said. The mark rose sharply against the franc on Monday before an increase in French short-term interest rates halted the franc's slide.
"We saw some selling of marks in Europe, and that gave a lift to the dollar," said Paul Farrell, managing director for foreign exchange at Chase Manhattan Bank.
The dollar traded as high as 1.4231 marks before retreating.
Currency traders remain wary that central banks will buy dollars in support of a call for a stronger dollar made over the weekend by the Group of Seven industrial nations.

HEADLINE: OLYMPICS;
African Athletes in New South

BYLINE: By JERE LONGMAN 

DATELINE: LAGRANGE, Ga.

 BODY:
As a civil rights leader, Andrew Young said he warily drove the roads of intolerance through this former cotton mill town during the days of the segregated South.
"When I lived in southern Georgia, I was scared to go through there on my way to Alabama," said Young, the former ambassador to the United Nations who is co-chairman of the Atlanta Olympic Organizing Committee. 
 Attitudes have changed in LaGrange, about 60 miles southwest of Atlanta, where an international vision has supplanted racial myopia. The town that Young once shunned because of its Jim Crow prejudice is now embraced by him for its training and cultural exchange programs with mostly African athletes who are preparing for the 1996 Summer Olympics.
Southern hospitality has not been extended so warmly by every Georgia community. The city of Winder rebuffed Somali athletes who sought a training site in Barrow County, and Cobb County lost the Olympic volleyball competition after passing an anti-homosexual resolution.
But even as the O. J. Simpson trial has underscored the depth of the racial divide in this country, LaGrange is preparing to play host to a sort of Olympic rainbow coalition: the entire delegation from South Africa; track-and-field athletes from such places as Mozambique, Mauritius, Swaziland, Zambia, Saudi Arabia and the Czech Republic; female basketball players from Brazil; softball players from the Netherlands; the equestrian team from France and race walkers from the United States.
Last week, Bobby Rearden, a member of the Atlanta organizing committee and one of the people responsible for the "I Train in LaGrange" program, said: "I think Andy is overwhelmed by this. He told me once, 'People in L.A. and New York will never believe this happens in the South.' "
LaGrange, population 26,000, has evolved from cotton-mill dependence into a regional center of industry and textiles that expects to be home to 400 athletes from 14 countries as they become acclimated to Georgia's heat and humidity before the centennial Games open next July 19.
Some of the foreign athletes have already arrived. Since 1991, the "I Train in LaGrange" program has played host to 60 international track and field athletes who have come here to train under Ron Davis, a New Yorker who spent 17 years coaching in Africa. The program is supported by local philanthropy, city and county funds, corporate sponsors and scholarships offered by the International Olympic Committee to athletes from developing countries.
The athletes train on a modern running track, attend the Methodist-affiliated LaGrange College or West Georgia Technical College, visit the children at local elementary schools and socialize with local residents through an adopt-an-athlete program.
Ruth Mangwe, a sprinter from Equatorial Guinea, arrived in LaGrange last New Year's Eve, never having run on anything but a grass track and unable to say as much as "Good morning," in English. Because she spoke Spanish, she was paired in the adopt-an-athlete program with Adolfo Benavides, a native of Colombia who is chairman of the business and economics department at LaGrange College. Less than a year later, her English has improved as dramatically as her times at 200 and 400 meters.
"Everything was very difficult for me; I didn't know English, I missed my parents and my brothers and sisters," Mangwe said. "But when I'm talking to Mr. Benavides, I'm home."
Benavides is a runner himself, a marathoner who trains on the track with the Olympic hopefuls, who opens his house to them on Thanksgiving and sees a bit of himself in them -- foreigners who need a friend far from home.
"They have a big adjustment to make," Benavides said. "The adjustment is a lot easier if they have a friend."
Lynn Dye and her husband have been host for two years of Barnabe Jolicoeur, a sprinter from Mauritius. Jolicoeur, like the other foreign athletes here, lives in a dormitory at LaGrange College, but he and others attend with their adoptive families such weekend gatherings as church, dinners and high school football games.
"I've gotten to know athletes from countries I had never heard of," Dye said. "It makes the world a lot smaller, which is the purpose of the Olympics."
The athletes seem welcomed at Turner Hall on the LaGrange College campus, even if the warm and fuzzy feelings of their fellow students are sometimes met with an equally fuzzy sense of geography.
"Do you know where Mauritius is?" Davis, the track coach, asked a freshman named Shelly Mathews about the island nation off the coast of eastern Africa.
"Is it in Brazil?" she replied.
Tina Paulino of Mozambique is the most accomplished athlete training in LaGrange. Last month, at the African championships in Harare, Zimbabwe, she finished second at 800 meters to her cousin, Maria Mutola, the world's top-ranked runner in the event. Mutola is only a phone call away at her training base in Oregon, Paulino said, but so is a to-be-avoided temptation -- junk food.
"I have to watch everything I eat here," Paulino said. "In the middle of the night, you can call for a pizza. In Africa, that doesn't happen."
Paulino is one of five athletes in LaGrange on a scholarship provided to athletes from emerging nations by the I.O.C.'s Olympic Solidarity program, which provides a stipend of $1,800 a month as long as certain performance standards are met. She is also studying education at LaGrange College. It is the educational triumphs, not the running victories, of these athletes that give him the most satisfaction, said Davis, their coach.
"These people are going to go home and contribute to their countries; some will become leaders," Davis said. "You've got to have education behind the sporting activity."
Tommy Asinga, a native of Surinam and a former standout 800-meter runner at Eastern Michigan University, has completed a year of veterinary school at Tuskegee Institute, 50 miles away in Alabama. When his I.O.C. scholarship was terminated, the LaGrange Sports Authority helped him secure a loan to remain in school, and they have provided money for food and housing.
"Without their help, I could not have afforded school," Asinga said. "When I came here, I only knew about five veterinarians in Surinam. I don't think there are many more than that."
The program evolved from an effort by Young and Davis to train African athletes in Atlanta before the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles. Young was an aspiring Olympic sprinter while at Howard University in the early 1950's, while Davis was a steeplechaser and coach at San Jose State in the 1960's. Five years ago, when Atlanta was awarded the 1996 Summer Games, the mayor of LaGrange at the time, Chris Joseph, sought to have a piece of the Olympic pie carved for his constituents.
LaGrange has since become 1 of 48 Georgia communities that will serve as pre-Olympic training sites. Not everything has gone smoothly here. The training program suffered an embarrassment last year when Horace Dove-Edwin of Sierra Leone took second place to Olympic champion Linford Christie of Britain at 100 meters at the British Commonwealth Games, only to be disqualified after failing a drug test.
Other athletes have left the program, uncomfortable with dormitory life and the rigors of school. Also, the LaGrange Sports Authority must raise about $2.5 million from foundations and corporate sponsors to meet its goal of becoming a regional training site for American athletes after the Atlanta Olympics. Still, the city has opened its arms in a way once thought unimaginable.
"It has become like a home," said Stephen Lugor, a 400-meter runner from Sudan. "I was away for three weeks this summer, competing in Sweden and Egypt, and I was lonely to come back."

HEADLINE: Mexico's Political Crisis

 BODY:
Two years of upheaval in Mexico has cracked a once-monolithic political establishment, but the transition from authoritarianism to democracy is incomplete. President Ernesto Zedillo, who met with President Clinton yesterday, has demonstrated more commitment to political reform than any recent Mexican leader. But he has run into strong opposition within his own, ruling party.
The Clinton Administration can help him by demonstrating that the United States attaches as much importance to his desire to free Mexico's politics as it does to opening its economy. Mexico's economic and social stability will be increasingly at risk until an outdated system of unaccountable political power is transformed. 
Washington has always offered rhetorical support to Mexican democracy, but its private messages have been ambiguous. Successive Administrations have known that elements of Mexico's ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, stole elections and protected drug traffickers. But as long as Mexican leaders promoted market reform and presented themselves as guarantors of stability, Washington raised no protest.
The PRI in its present state, however, is no longer a force for stability. Its original 1994 Presidential candidate was assassinated, and rogue elements of the PRI are suspected of involvement. Its Secretary General was gunned down in Mexico City, and the brother of former President Salinas is accused of masterminding the crime. Armed rebels in Chiapas won widespread support by demanding a more democratic political system.
Mr. Zedillo won the presidency last year in the least tainted election in decades. Though thrown off balance by an inherited financial crisis, he took promising early steps to cleanse the political system, for example appointing an independent attorney general to probe last year's assassinations. But Mexico still has a long way to go. Judges are not independent. Police torture of suspects is common. Recently the assassination investigations have stalled. Opposition from ruling party barons may be just too powerful.
Mr. Zedillo must break through this impasse. He must thoroughly separate the ruling party from the machinery of government. Without this, there can be no fair multi-party competition.
Debate on Mexico in this country has focused on the North American Free Trade Agreement, which despite the setback of the peso crisis is working reasonably well, and on this year's loan guarantees, which Mexico is paying back.
The issue of political reform is no less important, and there is not much time left for Mexico to get it right.

HEADLINE: Rebuilding New York Creates Jobs and Votes

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"New York City's Capital Needs" (editorial, Oct. 6), while on the money in calling for renewed capital funding to revitalize the city's ailing infrastructure, omits an important piece of the financial pie: Capital projects create jobs for thousands of (voting) New Yorkers. 
From architects, engineers, designers, consultants and construction managers, support staff, building tradespeople and unskilled laborers to such spinoff businesses as blueprinters and messengers that serve the industry, these jobs impact class, color and neighborhoods in the entire metropolitan area.
State politicians and city budgeteers, including Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and Comptroller Alan G. Hevesi, must remember that investing in infrastructure not only enhances our environment but also strengthens the work force and tax base.
New York's design and construction industry has been an important part of the city's economy. As public spending on capital projects for hospitals, housing, schools, jails, courts and other essentials has decreased, so has the vitality of this industry, leaving large and small businesses hard hit by the triple whammy effect of Federal, state and city cutbacks.

HEADLINE: BOOKS OF THE TIMES;
A Plea for Simpler Living as the World Warms Up

BYLINE: By RICHARD BERNSTEIN 

 BODY:

HOPE, HUMAN AND WILD
True Stories of Living Lightly on the Earth
By Bill McKibben
227 pages. Little, Brown & Company. $22.95.
This new book by Bill McKibben is a kind of sequel to "The End of Nature," which attracted a great deal of attention when it was published six years ago and made Mr. McKibben perhaps the nation's most prominent literary environmentalist. The book's stark concept was that global warming, caused by hydrocarbon consumption, erased nature as something separate from human civilization. Too much carbon dioxide affects all of nature, altering "the most fundamental phenomena," with consequences likely to be disastrous.
"Writing that book depressed me," Mr. McKibben declares near the beginning of "Hope, Human and Wild." In his new book, which is "devoted to strategies for retooling our societies and economies so they do less damage," Mr. McKibben tries to improve the mood by providing evidence that we could live more "lightly on the earth" and still be all right. He talks about three places, the Adirondacks where he lives, the city of Curitiba in Brazil and the densely populated state of Kerala in extreme southwestern India. Curitiba and Kerala, he writes, make do with far less than we have, and yet they have not sacrificed health, longevity or the possibility of happiness. They therefore provide the sort of hope and vision that might help us to think more boldly about home. 
 Mr. McKibben is certainly not wrong to emphasize the gravity of our ecological situation or to advocate simpler ways of life in which we would use bicycles for transportation, do without bananas (and the environmental cost of shipping them), join rural cooperatives for our fruit and vegetables and begin to think of other economic paradigms besides continuous growth. His new book, which often has the homiletic tone of a Sunday school sermon, is nonetheless disappointing as an environmentalist's prescription for a new future.
In part this is because Mr. McKibben is not a sophisticated thinker on economic matters. He does not generally take into account the consequences of the measures he proposes. A reduction in the huge North American consumption of bananas, to take one small example, would increase poverty among South Americans who grow them, yet reconciling ecological needs with basic economic needs is the nub of the issue. Meanwhile, Mr. McKibben's descriptions of places like Curitiba and Kerala are too breathless to provide the inspiration he intends.
To be sure, Mr. McKibben is much too smart to fall into a simple utopianism as he searches for lessons in these locales. He allows that the communities he has studied, including the American one where he lives, are poor and want to be less so. But Curitiba and Kerala, he argues, can ease our understandable fear that living with less "would plunge us into a world of poverty, disease, ignorance -- that it's either our life in all its detail or a grim, short, narrow life." Kerala, for example, has achieved life expectancies, infant mortality rates, levels of literacy and an atmosphere of liveliness that rival our own, but on one-seventieth of what we spend per capita. "It gives the lie to the idea that only endless economic growth can produce decent human lives," Mr. McKibben writes.
But one month in Brazil and another month in India do not make for great expertise on either place, and one senses that Mr. McKibben's descriptions are both too rosy and too thin. "Romanticizing Kerala is a mistake," Mr. McKibben writes, but he does romanticize Kerala. While Japan, Taiwan and South Korea have gone in for economic growth, "Kerala has been much more interested in sharing what wealth is available," he writes. But Japan et al. have achieved Western standards of living and of cultural and scientific advance. Kerala has a per capita income of $330, and its chief source of hard currency is the tens of thousands of its sons who leave their homes and families to labor in the oilfields of the Persian Gulf. One critic cited by Mr. McKibben calls Kerala "a bloated social welfare state without the economy to support it."
And still Mr. McKibben glows with admiration. "If there's a general lesson about socialism provided by Kerala, it's that the government benefits from having to answer to voters," he writes, not explaining why this is a lesson in socialism rather than democracy. Mr. McKibben interviews a Gandhian disciple named Vishwanathan who describes to him "a future as close to the one envisioned by E. F. Schumacher or Thomas Jefferson or Gandhi as is currently imaginable on this planet." On a per capita income of $330?
Mr. McKibben surely does us a service in raising the possibility of alternative concepts of the good life, but he often leaves difficult questions unanswered. He disparages the new policies of economic growth in China, but plainly the Chinese people, who were forced to endure three decades of a political philosophy that largely prevented economic growth, want it now. Is there really a Kerala-style alternative? Early on, talking about his home territory, Mr. McKibben describes the regeneration of the Northeastern American forest, calling it "the great environmental story of the United States -- in some ways, of the whole world." But wasn't this natural regeneration made possible by agribusiness in the Midwest and by the replacement of wood by oil as a primary source of fuel, in short by the sorts of development he deplores? Later, Mr. McKibben speaks approvingly of efforts in the Northeast to revive farming, so the region can be more self-sufficient, even if it means food will be more expensive. But wouldn't such a revival on a scale sufficient for self-sufficiency lead again to the cutting of the forests?
What we seem to need, especially in light of possible global warming, is a way of making environmental prudence compatible with development to alleviate global poverty and perhaps produce more new technology, like fiber optics, to ease the strain on the earth's natural resources.
Hard thinking will be required on this, and there are probably few more qualified to do it than Mr. McKibben. He just hasn't done enough of it yet.

HEADLINE: Wine Talk

BYLINE: By Frank J. Prial 

 BODY:
A DEATH in California, an anniversary in Maryland, a winery closing in France: three events, none directly related, but all of them worthy of note for anyone interested in wine as a cultural and social phenomenon and as a part of history.
When Leon D. Adams first wrote his "Wines of America" (McGraw-Hill), in 1973, there were 254 bonded wineries in 18 of the 50 states. In 1990, when he published the fourth edition, there were 1,200. There have been more learned treatises on American wine over the years but few as readable and none as opinionated. Mr. Adams died on Sept. 14 at 90. 
 Mr. Adams was a journalist in his early days, but when his interest was drawn to wine, he became an advocate -- and a feisty one at that. Throughout his long life, his nemesis was prohibition and its adherents. He excoriated the temperance advocates who condemned wine drinking on moral and economic grounds, and then the current wave of fitness enthusiasts who see wine as harmful to good health (he described them pungently as "health fascists").
Long before the American middle class thought of wine as anything but a foreign affectation or a drink for poor immigrants, Mr. Adams was crusading for it as a healthy, moderate substitute for hard liquor -- a food product as deserving of a place at every dinner table as bread.
He was an unabashed chauvinist. "In the quantity of wine it produces annually, the United States ranks sixth among wine-growing nations," he wrote. "In the quality of its wines, it ranks first."
As much as he railed at the idea of prohibition -- and he was old enough to remember the real thing -- Mr. Adams believed it was a major factor in this country's subsequent wine-making achievements. "Reborn when national Prohibition ended in 1933," he wrote, the American wine industry "chose the scientific approach to quality."
The Americans rejected "the traditions, cobwebbed cellars and primitive methods that long hindered wine progress in Europe," he wrote, to utilize "the new research in viticulture and enology in which the United States has led the world."
Mr. Adams's writing seems confrontational, almost belligerent now, in a time when wine has pretty much achieved its place in the sun. But few among us realize what an uphill battle he and his colleagues fought, not too many years ago, to make wine not even popular -- just respectable.
A longtime editor of food magazines recalled those days -- which were as recent as the 70's. "If we published a recipe for coq au vin," she said, "we had to make it clear that the alcohol in the wine boiled off during the cooking."
Mr. Adams spent a lifetime trying to make wine, especially American wine, a part of American life. He lived long enough to see his dream come true.
On the other side of the United States, just five years after Mr. Adams's "Wines of America" first appeared, a young Baltimore lawyer borrowed $2,000 from his parents and mailed out 6,500 copies of a wine newsletter he had just prepared. Now, 18 years later, Robert M. Parker Jr. is celebrating the 100th issue of that newsletter, known among wine enthusiasts worldwide as The Wine Advocate.
It took Mr. Parker six years to reach 10,000 in paid circulation, the point at which he had promised himself that he would leave law and devote all his energy to wine. That was in 1984, the year he announced in his newsletter that the 1982 vintage in Bordeaux was one of the greatest ever. Other American wine critics disagreed, but in denouncing Mr. Parker's position, they gave him, he readily acknowledges now, the publicity he needed to make wine his career.
Six times a year in The Wine Advocate, Mr. Parker reviews hundreds of wines. He pioneered the use of the 100-point system, familiar to anyone who attended American schools, in evaluating wines. The system has made his critiques accessible to his American audience but has also irritated some critics and segments of the wine trade, who argue that numbers are inadequate to the judgment of something so complex.
Mr. Parker's influence is formidable. Stories, mostly apocryphal, circulate about rich collectors of uncertain tastes who demand of their wine merchants "$10,000 of 1990 Bordeaux, all above 95 in Parker." There is gossip, too, about French wine makers who supposedly change their vinification procedures to make wines that Mr. Parker might conceivably praise.
More important, perhaps, is the fact that, after tasting literally thousands of wines, his enthusiasm remains undiminished. Reporting on Burgundies in the current issue of The Wine Advocate, he finds the 1993's of the Domaine Meo-Camuzet to be "thrilling wines." On the Domaine Leroy, he explains that his tasting notes will be brief because "it is almost criminal to describe wines that may be the greatest red Burgundies I will taste in my life." Of the 1986 Penfolds Grange Hermitage, from Australia, he writes, "This may turn out to be superior to the 1971 and 1976 -- imagine that!"
Mr. Parker, who is 48, represents a different generation from that of Mr. Adams, but he is as passionate about furthering the cause of wine as Mr. Adams was. Mr. Adams fought for wine's recognition. Mr. Parker takes that for granted: he fights for better wines by challenging all wine makers to make them better.
Traditions, in wine writing or wine making, are new to the United States -- they are really just starting. In France last week, a venerable one came to an end. In Argenteuil, a suburb of Paris, Jacques Defresne, a part-time grape grower and wine maker, announced that 1995 would be his last vintage. Mr. Defresne's half-acre of hybrid Seyve-Villard grapes is almost all that remains of what was until the 18th-century an important wine producing area.
"My family has cultivated the vine in Argenteuil since 1342," Mr. Defresne told his local newspaper, "but I'm 73 now and even my little plot is too much work. I'm going to concentrate on my fruit trees."
 
Tasting
 
Rodney Strong Zinfandel, River West Vineyard
Old Vines, 1993. About $14.
 
Rod Strong has retired from the remarkable wine business he founded more than 35 years ago, but his legacy lingers on -- not just in his name, but also in wines like this delicious, medium-bodied zinfandel. Even in Sonoma County, California's optimum zinfandel region, River West Vineyard is prime. The old vines are valued, not for their productiveness, which can be very low, but for the concentration of flavor in the few grapes they do provide. The current vogue for richly flavored, darkly hued California wines made from robust warm-climate grapes like mourvedre and sangiovese owes much to zinfandel. It sometimes lacks the finesse of the best cabernets, but its rustic quality fits those robust, uncomplicated dishes of the chilly months ahead.

New Love, Without Walls or Artifice

BYLINE: By ALLAN KOZINN 

 BODY:
The New York City Opera tends to wring as much as it can out of its standard-repertory productions, but even this economical company sometimes scraps its old favorites and starts fresh. Its durable old production of "La Boheme" dated from 1966, the year the City Opera moved to the New York State Theater, and although it served the company well, it looked increasingly shopworn in recent seasons.
To replace it, the City Opera brought in Graziella Sciutti, an Italian soprano who gave up the stage in 1977 and became a director. Her version of the Puccini classic, which had its premiere on Saturday night, is a handsome, traditional staging, nicely detailed yet uncluttered and unlikely to grow dated quickly. Its stage pictures, designed by Michael Anania, are appealingly panoramic. The sparsely furnished garret of the first and last acts radiates around a huge window with the walls only suggested, so that one looks through them over the roofs of Montmartre. 
 The walls of the Cafe Momus are similarly transparent; the revelry in the Latin Quarter streets on Christmas Eve merges with the hubbub inside the cafe. And the third act unfolds before a graceful, arching gateway to a snowy lane lined with bare trees. Jeff Davis's lighting suggests the Parisian midwinter chill as well as the warm glow of the finale.
The company has cast this attractive staging with singers who sound and look right in the roles, and Ms. Sciutti moves them through the piece with an unpretentious efficiency that yields a sense of realism. A minor but telling touch is her direction of the landlord Benoit and of Musetta's sugar daddy, Alcindoro. Often played as slapstick by a single singer, the roles are taken here by Don Yule and William Ledbetter, who do them straight and let the comedy come from the music and the text, not from overacting.
This sensible approach to the smallest roles was a bonus in a show that was consistently well cast. Stella Zambalis played Mimi as sweet and demure, but with a reserve of strong personal will that blossomed in the last two acts. Vocally, Ms. Zambalis was a delight: her high notes floated without strain, and she sang with vibrato and a sense of color that were regulated to suit the shape of the line.
John Fowler matched her nicely as Rodolfo. His tenor seemed small in the opening horseplay scenes, but by the time he reached "Che gelida manina," his sound was heftier and better rounded. He sang that tenor showpiece with considered lyricism, and occasionally with a touch of old-fashioned coloration, and he gave Rodolfo dimension, particularly in the emotional juggling of the third act.
Robert Perry was a robust, likable Marcello. Stephen Powell and Dong-Jian Gong might have been more colorful as Shaunard and Colline, but they were unobjectionable and unobtrusive. And if Jane Thorngren did not quite match Ms. Zambalis's beauty of tone, her Musetta was an endearing firebrand.
Robert Duerr, the conductor, has proven himself a strong asset to the company this year, stepping in to conduct the difficult "Mathis der Maler" while preparing his own productions. His approach to "Boheme" was unusually flexible, beginning at a brisk pace that stripped away the glutinous overlay that too often weakens the opening scenes, yet allowing his Rodolfo and Mimi enough leeway to convey the exploratory moments of a new love affair. Later Mr. Duerr was more expansive, both in his tempos and in his expressive toying with dynamics, and in the last two acts he drew from the orchestra as rich a sound as it has produced in recent memory.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING;
A California savings and loan takes some shots at the big banks, and meets with apparent success.

BYLINE: By Andrea Adelson 

 BODY:
IN the typically genteel world of financial-institution advertising, tradition remains important. Messages suggest stability and financial might, most making no claim bolder than "Our C.D. Rates Add Up to Big Numbers." Comparisons are indirect, if at all.
But in California, one institution is rewriting those rules. Glendale Federal Bank has ditched gentility for a bare-knuckle attack, spending $16 million to specifically take on the state's biggest banks, Bank of America and Wells Fargo, in a contentious campaign by the BBDO West unit of the Omnicom Group in Los Angeles. 
 "You Deserve Better," one Glendale Federal billboard declares; the red "no" slash symbol appears over the words "B of A." The sign encourages Bank of America customers to call 1 800-41-FED UP.
A print ad aimed at Wells Fargo & Company and its famous logo says, "After spending five minutes with the stagecoach bankers, maybe you'll want to get the hell out of Dodge."
This is a landmark campaign in an industry where hard-sell advertising aimed at rivals is rare, Gail J. Liberman, editor of the Bank Rate Monitor, a weekly financial trade publication in North Palm Beach, Fla., said, "It's fairly controversial to give equal weight to a competitor."
But other banks using aggressive advertising to try "to create a whole movement in the marketplace" have seen it pay off, Ms. Liberman said, like the Bank South Corporation in Atlanta and the Washington Mutual Savings Bank in Seattle.
The spirited ads by Bank South and Washington Mutual spoke to consumers with bruised loyalties after out-of-town banks took over local institutions in those markets.
"There was an opportunistic period where we took advantage of the situation," said Craig Metz, advertising director of Bank South. Ads knocking the bank's four main rivals on issues like convenience helped Bank South increase its market share to 33 percent from 15 percent in less than three years, he said. (After the campaign ended in 1994, Bank South was bought by a target of its ads, Nationsbank.)
In Seattle, an eight-month ad blitz in 1992 that urged consumers to "merge with" Washington Mutual is credited with doubling the institution's account growth.
"We felt there was an opportunity to attract disenchanted customers from other institutions," said William Ehrlich, a spokesman for Washington Mutual.
It has been two years since California's largest bank merger, between the BankAmerica Corporation and Security Pacific. Even so, "people will readily tell you they're dissatisfied," said Stephen J. Trafton, chief executive of Glendale Federal, which is based in Glendale, Calif. "It's alienated the customer base," he added, which is "ripe for attack."
Early this year, as Mr. Trafton sought to distance Glendale Federal from its troubled past, the savings and loan scrapped its previous campaign, a snoozer that emphasized savings. After nearly being seized by regulators, Glendale Federal was replenished with fresh capital last year, partly from the sale of out-of-state holdings, narrowing its focus to 148 branches in California.
The attack ads are not merely marketing ploys; they underscore a substantive effort by Glendale Federal to expand beyond just mortgages and offering better rates on certificates of deposit. Like other savings institutions, Glendale Federal is becoming more like commercial banks, wooing checking-account customers to try selling them an array of financial services.
It has also helped that Glendale Federal's stronghold is Southern California, which had been Security Pacific's home turf.
"Glendale has really come alive since March," said Barry Rubens, president of the California Research Corporation in Santa Monica, publisher of a bank newsletter. "They are feeding on existing discontent with B of A.
"If they keep hammering, it becomes more than a perception," he added. "It could be effective."
Besides the attack campaign, BBDO West has created memorable but less pointed TV commercials that ridicule big banks for poor service. More print ads and television spots are planned for next month.
Since the campaign began in January, according to two analysts' reports, Glendale Federal has seen deposits increase 20 percent, while other California savings and loans saw growth of 10 percent or less. At the same time, the reports said, Wells Fargo, First Interstate Bancorp and Bank of America lost deposits.
Still, Glendale Federal is a piggy bank compared with its giant rivals; it has $15 billion in assets, while Bank of America, for example, has $180 billion. And Bank of America is estimated to have outspent Glendale 4 to 1 in advertising last year.
Mr. Trafton credited the aggressive campaign with lowering the average age of Glendale Federal clients to 38 from 58 and improving the savings and loan's profit margins.
Have the big banks counterattacked? "No," he said, asserting, "That's how much they care about retail customers."
Bank of America, for its part, said it intended to stick with a campaign carrying the theme "Banking on America," created by Ketchum Advertising, a unit of Ketchum Communications Inc. Harvey M. Radin, a BankAmerica spokesman in San Francisco, said that "we're not seeing any impact" from the tough-talking Glendale Federal ads.
Lorna Doubet, a spokeswoman for Wells Fargo in San Francisco, said her company chose to take the high road: "We don't do this kind of advertising, and don't respond to attacks like this."

HEADLINE: Russia Answers Capitalism: Let the People Have Fur!

BYLINE: By MICHAEL SPECTER 

DATELINE: PUSHKINO, Russia

 BODY:
A sharp hint of winter has begun to fill the air here. Most days the frost is still gone with the sun, but now is the time when Russians begin to dress like Russians again: the season of fur has returned.
And this year it has returned with a twist that has astonished everyone from the people in this small town who run the country's largest fur farm to shopkeepers in Moscow and importers across the globe. 
 With six types of mink, huge reserves of fox, and sable so luxurious that, according to legend, the ancient Greeks and Romans called it the Golden Fleece, fur exports have always helped fix the Russian identity in Western minds.
Not anymore. Fur exports have slowed to a fraction of what they were just five years ago, but not because prices have soared or animal-rights advocates have turned off the West entirely to fur.
It's simpler than that. Russians themselves -- often newly rich, profoundly ostentatious and hellbent on staying warm throughout the six-month winter -- are buying fur as never before.
"The market in Russia is simply exploding," said Jay Mechutan, a New York fur importer who has been working with the Russians for more than 50 years, longer than any other American fur company.
"They used to send us anything they could. Now they are buying even the most expensive of their own products, and when that isn't good enough you find them at every world auction from Greece to Stockholm to Hong Kong. With the possible exception of the Koreans, they have become the largest consumers in the world market. And it pretty much happened overnight."
Well, maybe not quite overnight. Fur and caviar, after all, are Russia's two most famous luxury items. And fur has been a signature status symbol here for centuries.
It was the magnificent and elusive sable, with its rich silky undercoat, that helped lure Russians 5,000 miles across Siberia over much of the world's most inhospitable terrain. By the middle of the 17th century Europe had lost its mind over the stuff, and it was worth more than gold. Long before, however, some fanciful 10th-century designer even tried to stitch sable and mink along the edges of a few early Russian Knights' shining armor.
But fur sales have had their rough spots lately, particularly in the United States. In the 1980's retail sales of fur cruised up to about $2 billion. But the 80's are over, at least in the West. Tighter money, the second warmest winter in a century and the clear impact of animal-rights protests nearly halved retail sales in the United States last year from what they were in 1987.
In earlier decades that might have devastated the market here. But, at least for the privileged few thousand, times are better now.
While no statistics are issued on domestic fur consumption, in 1991, the Russian state statistical agency says, there was almost exactly $60 million worth of fur purchased for export. The next year the figure inched up to $62 million, and it grew again in 1993, when for the first time more than 50,000 pounds of pelts, worth $64 million, were sent abroad.
But last year the export market appeared to crash, falling to only $30 million worth of sales, even though more skins were culled than ever before. This year that trend will surely deepen.
"We were taken by surprise at first," said Andrei P. Nyukhalov, deputy director of the Pushkino fur farm here less than an hour north of Moscow, where thousands of sables live their very abbreviated, caged lives under security that would make the old leaders of the K.G.B. proud.
"We thought nobody was going to buy the fur," he added. "Then we realized they were buying it all in Russia."
The fur stores of Moscow are having a busy autumn. The expensive skins are selling briskly, but the cheaper coats are almost impossible to keep in stock.
"Of course I have always wanted a fur coat," Irina P. Titova, a 35-year-old secretary, said as she tried on a dark mink that cost about $6,500 in a store at Petrovsky Passage, one of Moscow's tonier shopping malls. "The question I have been asking all summer is, 'Do I buy something this good or do I settle for less?' "
She reluctantly settled for fox at less than half the price. But many people, in Moscow at least, no longer have to. It is possible to buy a full-length mink coat in Moscow for less than $5,000 -- still unimaginably expensive for most Russians -- but a trifle for the truly wealthy new Russians who would not think twice about dropping that amount in a brief night at a casino.
Sable, of course, is another thing. At Pushkino, where 40 percent of the caged sable in Russia is raised each year in individual cages not much bigger than the animals themselves, each pelt can go for up to $500 -- and it can take 100 of them to make a coat. But the average price for a sable coat is more than $50,000 -- because it is so difficult to match the pelts properly.
"If you've ever managed to scrape up enough money to find some fur to wear through a Russian winter you will never turn back," said Valintina V. Ponikova, the deputy director of one of the city's largest fur stores near Red Square, named Fur Store, which is what they all used to be called in the Soviet era.
Mrs. Ponikova has worked in the same store for 35 years, so she can lay claim to some perspective. "Russian women come in here every day and buy $10,000 coats now," she said, still a little taken aback by it all. "But the real growth has been in the cheaper furs. Not everyone has the money for a real good mink, but often people can pay for something less rare."
As the Russian consumer starts earning enough money to make the leap from a fur hem on a wool coat to a genuine fur hat or a fur coat itself, producers here are trying to accommodate them by raising breeds ordinary people can afford. Many Russian fur producers are turning away from mink and sable to less expensive products like lambskin, nutria and cheaper varieties of fox that can all sell for less than $1,000 a coat.
This is driven partly by the desire to meet a market, but even more powerfully by today's farm realities. It costs a lot of money to feed a sable or mink -- at least $250 in the six months of its existence -- and the food has to be rich in vitamins if the skins are going to be warm and soft. The food investment has driven hundreds of small fur farms out of business, although bigger companies like this one in Pushkino are always ready to sweep up the spoils.
There are few countries that have as much right as Russia to be gung-ho on fur. Two-thirds of the Russian land mass stays frozen from October to April. Most of the rest of the country has winters far colder than say, Dallas or Miami, two of the cities where, according to the Fur Information Council, American fur consumption never seems to dip.
Even animal-rights activists here do not waste too much energy on the issue.
"We have so many serious problems with the way animals are treated in this country that I cannot honestly say this is one of our biggest concerns," said Vera Maksimova, head of the Russian Society for the Protection of Animals. It is the only major animal-rights agency remaining in Russia.
"We are against the wearing of fur," she said. "But I have to admit that it's a sign of a strong economy, and that is something in the end I can hardly oppose. I guess I think asking Russians not to wear fur is a little bit unrealistic, even for me."

HEADLINE: COMPANY REPORTS;
Chrysler Posts Drop in Profit As Kerkorian Hones Attack

BYLINE: By JAMES BENNET 

DATELINE: DETROIT, Oct. 11

 BODY:
As Kirk Kerkorian turned up the heat on the Chrysler Corporation today by accusing it of complacency and highhandedness toward shareholders, the company reported sharply lower earnings for the third quarter, citing the costs of introducing new mini-vans and of priming a reluctant market with rebates.
In line with analysts' expectations, Chrysler's net income fell 46 percent, to $354 million, from a record $651 million in the corresponding period a year earlier. Chrysler's worldwide vehicle sales dipped slightly in the quarter, but revenue climbed 2.6 percent, to $12 billion from $11.7 billion. 
 The earnings came to 91 cents a share, down from $1.76 a share a year earlier. With Chrysler predicting a return to strong profitability in the fourth quarter, its stock rose slightly, closing at $52.75 a share, up 12.5 cents, on the New York Stock Exchange.
The stock might also have been buoyed by the saber-rattling in Mr. Kerkorian's camp, analysts said. Jerome B. York, Mr. Kerkorian's chief strategist, assailed the company today in a speech in New York, saying his weeks spent analyzing Chrysler had convinced him that its costs were rising dangerously.
In the clearest articulation yet of a theme crucial to Mr. Kerkorian as he takes on Chrysler, Mr. York portrayed himself as an avatar of shareholder activism squaring off against top managers and directors who are unresponsive to shareholders' concerns. "They can't stand the thought of having directors on the board that really represent shareholders," said Mr. York, who once was Chrysler's chief financial officer.
Mr. York said that Chrysler was trying to paint the Tracinda Corporation, Mr. Kerkorian's wholly owned company, as hostile to create an excuse to dismiss Tracinda's criticisms. "The comments emanating from Chrysler suggest they want to roll back the hands of time to the 'good old days' -- as they would view it -- before shareholder activism," Mr. York said.
Mr. York said Chrysler's fixed costs had risen from slightly more than $8 billion in 1992 to $10.5 billion this year, and would reach $11 billion in 1996. He also said warranty costs had risen 50 percent since 1993, to $2 billion or more. In a telephone interview, Mr. York said the increased warranty costs probably arose mostly from faulty engines and transmissions.
The rising costs, he said, are increasing Chrysler's break-even point, the level of sales at which the company is profitable, to about 70 percent of factory capacity this year from 65 percent in 1994. Mr. York's speech, before the Nationsbank 1995 Corporate Bond Conference, had been scheduled before he left I.B.M. on Sept. 5 to join Mr. Kerkorian, Tracinda said.
Chrysler dismissed Mr. York's numbers, but declined to address them point by point. In a statement, the company said, "Kerkorian and his people are out of touch with the auto industry in general and Chrysler in particular."
The company said it welcomed "constructive dialogue" with shareholders, but added, "Given Kerkorian's past record of sucking out cash and selling off assets, we are not convinced that his motives are in the best interests of all Chrysler shareholders."
For the three months ended Sept. 30, Chrysler's woes centered on mini-vans. A shortage of new-model mini-vans cost the company sales, while a surplus of the old ones drove up incentive costs. In addition to those costs, Chrysler said it spent $70 million in the quarter to introduce its new mini-vans and $30 million to start production of its full-size Ram pickup truck at a plant in St. Louis.
Incentives in the quarter averaged $870 a vehicle, up from $520 a year earlier, but down from $1,035 in the second quarter. David Healy, auto analyst with Burnham Securities, said that incentives declined to an average of $671 by the end of the quarter, as Chrysler sold out of its old mini-vans. That bodes well for the rest of the year, he said.
Gary C. Valade, Chrysler's chief financial officer, said: "We see good things for the fourth quarter. The mini-van launch is behind us." He said Chrysler would have full production of mini-vans by the end of the year.
Asked whether Chrysler would post a year-over-year increase in profits in the fourth quarter after three quarters of declines, Mr. Valade said, "We have a shot at having more favorable earnings."
Chrysler finished the third quarter with $6.4 billion in cash on hand, down from $6.6 billion a year earlier and $6.9 billion at the end of the second quarter. Mr. Valade said the declining reserve did not reflect pressure from Mr. Kerkorian, who has said Chrysler should be keeping no more than $5 billion on hand to protect it in a downturn.
Mr. Valade said Chrysler expected to have about $7 billion in cash at the end of the year. Chrysler has set a target for the reserve of $7.5 billion.
Chrysler said that its sales in Mexico dropped to 6,000 vehicles in the third quarter from 24,000 a year earlier, costing the company about $100 million in revenue.

The decline in earnings for the latest third quarter compared with the year-earlier period was primarily due to lower mini-van production volume, costs associated with the introduction of new mini-vans, and the production start of Chrysler's full-size Dodge Ram pickup truck. The decline was also due to a leaner sales mixture, more costly incentives and the unfavorable economic conditions in Mexico.
Revenue is total revenue.

HEADLINE: Police Bullets Among Those That Wounded an Officer

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS 

 BODY:
A police officer who was shot four times in an East Village bodega Tuesday night was caught in a hail of gunfire between the police and drug dealers, the police said, with two of the bullets striking him fired by fellow officers.
As the wounded officer, Keith Prunty, 29, remained in very serious condition yesterday at Bellevue Hospital with bullet wounds in the chest, groin, shoulder and thigh, investigators tried to reconstruct what they said they believed was a robbery gone awry at the Lopez Deli at 272 Third Street off Avenue C. One of four men the police said were robbing the bodega of heroin and cash was fatally shot, and the other three men were arrested. 
 Officer Prunty and his partner, Officer Gerald Derby, were patrolling in their radio car around 11 P.M. when a pedestrian flagged them down to report a robbery on the block. The officers called for backup as they sped toward the bodega. When they arrived, "there was a fusillade," said Assistant Chief John J. Hill, commanding officer of Manhattan detectives.
John F. Timoney, First Deputy Police Commissioner, said at a news conference late yesterday that a man in the bodega had reached for a gun, and Officers Prunty and Derby had shot him. When Officer Prunty moved to search the suspect, a second gunman emerged from a rear door of the bodega.
By then four more police officers had arrived at the bodega, and Officer Prunty was caught in the ensuing gunfight, Mr. Timoney said. A total of five police officers fired, including Officer Prunty, with two of their bullets striking Officer Prunty, the police said. Officer Prunty fired 15 shots, emptying his gun. There were at least 30 shots fired altogether, the police said. All of the officers were wearing bulletproof vests.
Officials said that all of the officers would be questioned and that ballistics tests would be done to determine which officers fired and when. The officials emphasized that while officers are trained to avoid endangering one another, in the case of wild shootouts, accidents can happen.
The police found 50 small bags of heroin and three semiautomatic handguns yesterday at the bodega.
"It appears like it was a drug ripoff," Chief Hill said in a brief interview.
A man whose apartment is in the same building as the store and who spoke on the condition of anonymity said he heard intense arguing in Spanish among three or four men for several minutes before he heard shots.
Police officials said the owner and employees of the bodega are being questioned. They said that the bodega has been under surveillance by the police and the Federal Drug Enforcement Administration for a year and has been the scene of three shootings since April, including Tuesday's.
Officer Prunty of Levittown, L.I., is the son of a retired New York City police officer. He is married, with two daughters, ages 9 and 3 months. He has received several commendations during his four-year career.
Mr. Timoney, speaking from Bellevue Hospital, said that Officer Prunty was in good spirits. "He gave a thumbs up and wrote a note to his wife saying he loved her," Mr. Timoney said.
"He is a good solid cop, a good street guy," said Deputy Inspector Richard E. Seta, who was Officer Prunty's commanding officer until December. "He was responsive to the community and very reliable."
The police could not immediately identify the man killed in the shooting. The three men who were arrested and charged with assault and robbery were Benjamin Lugo, 18, of 662 Water Street in Manhattan; Sigfredo Mendez, 22, of 934 East Seventh Street in Manhattan, and Edwin Rivera, 20, of 89-01 202d Street in the Hollis section of Queens.
Neighborhood residents complained of open drug dealing and of young lookouts armed with beepers who stand at the corners of Avenues C and D to warn of police patrols.
"Everywhere you go you see a grocery store and they're dealing drugs," said George Rodriguez, a 40-year-old unemployed man who lives a block away. "Nobody's safe."

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS;
2 Magazines To Appoint New Publishers

BYLINE: By DEIRDRE CARMODY 

 BODY:
The American Express Publishing Corporation, which has struggled to overcome the effects of poor management and a lack of investment in the early 1990's, is finally feeling cocky again. Today it is expected to announce new publishers for Travel & Leisure and Food & Wine.
"We are putting the finishing touches on the turnaround of our magazines," said Daniel B. Brewster Jr., president and chief executive of the corporation, which is the publishing arm of the American Express Company. 
 Ed Kelly, publisher of Food & Wine, will succeed Richard Barthelmes as publisher of Travel & Leisure. Julie McGowan, advertising director of The New Yorker and prior to that founding publisher of Family Life, will replace Mr. Kelly. Mr. Barthelmes is leaving to pursue other endeavors.
The division also publishes Departures, Your Company and Sky Guide, an in-flight directory. It has a book group and a new media group.
Even as many magazines are feeling the effects of increases in postal rates and paper costs, Mr. Brewster said that the American Express group's profit would rise for the first time since 1991. He said that revenue is up 10 percent from last year.
Figures from Publishers Information Bureau, which tracks ad pages and revenue, show Travel & Leisure down 3.2 percent in ad pages for the first nine months of the year compared with the corresponding period last year, a time when Conde Nast Traveler, published by Advance Publications, passed Travel & Leisure in ad pages for the first time.
Mr. Brewster said that while the third quarter was weak, Travel & Leisure would finish strongly because of a strong fourth quarter. Its circulation of 962,000 is up 4.7 percent for the first six months of 1995.
Food & Wine, with a circulation of 789,000, is up 30 percent in ad pages for the first nine months of the year.
Since 1993, the company has been managed by Time Inc. Ventures, a unit of Time Warner, under the terms of an unusual deal signed in March 1993. Mr. Brewster, who is employed by Time, reports to a board of officials from Time Inc. and American Express Travel Related Services. Time Inc. receives a management fee and profits above a benchmark level are shared.
When Time Inc. took over, an advertising recession besetting the magazine industry had been in effect for three years. Circulation and ad pages were down, the American Express magazines were stagnant and the parent company had virtually ceased investing in the publications.
Individuals at Time Inc. said that Time Inc. tried to sell the magazines. But it learned that the loss of the American Express data base made them far less attractive to potential buyers, so it decided to try to turn the magazines around.

HEADLINE: All 36 of Pataki's Nominees Confirmed by State Senate

BYLINE: By RAYMOND HERNANDEZ 

DATELINE: ALBANY, Oct. 11

 BODY:
The State Senate today confirmed 36 of Gov. George E. Pataki's nominees -- many of them his political supporters and campaign contributors -- to an assortment of posts, rejecting none.
The confirmations, ranging from the important to the minor, included two men named to run the state's Mental Health Department and the Division of Human Rights. The approvals of the nominees came as Democrats complained that the Pataki administration had used a number of posts to reward supporters. 
 "I think it's excessive the way that they are using the levers of government to reward people for their partisan political activities and their fund raising," said Senator Franz S. Leichter, a Democrat from Manhattan. "I find it disturbing."
Criticism focused on three nominees for directors of the state's Science and Technology Board, which awards large grants to research institutes and companies to encourage high-technology industries in the state.
The men -- Charles Dorkey 3d, David Feinberg and Anthony Gioia -- have collectively made contributions of more than $86,000 to Mr. Pataki's campaign. Their confirmations are expected to be taken up by the Senate on Thursday.
But Mr. Gioia, a businessman from Buffalo, dismissed the criticism and said that it was not unusual for a politician to appoint someone who was a campaign supporter.
"It's not the first time this has happened in the history of either party," said Mr. Gioia, who like the others would receive no salary if confirmed. "I supported Governor Pataki because we shared the same ideology, and he would like that ideology implemented through his appointments."
Mr. Pataki also nominated to minor posts a number of other people who contributed to his campaign, including James Ortenzio, a business executive from New York City, and Louise Woerner, who heads a home health care company in Rochester.
Their collective contributions totaled $25,500. The Senate voted to approve Mr. Ortenzio's nomination to the board of trustees of Cornell University, as well as approving Ms. Woerner's nomination to the Public Health Council.
The Governor also nominated the Rev. Calvin Butts to both the Science and Technology Board and the Empire State Development Corporation, an economic-development agency. The Rev. Butts gave Mr. Pataki's campaign a major push last year after he invited the Governor to speak to his congregation at the Abyssinian Baptist Church, a prominent black church in Harlem.
The formal vote in the Republican-controlled Senate took place this afternoon after a roughly one-hour hearing before the Senate Finance Committee in which every one of the 36 nominees was accepted with no resistance. The Senate will resume the nomination hearings on Thursday.
James L. Stone, 55, a former director of mental health and community services in Monroe County, was approved as Commissioner of the Mental Health Department, one of the nation's largest mental health systems, with 2,300 employees and a $2 billion annual budget. He has been Acting Commissioner since his nomination in August. His salary will be $102,335.
The Senate also filled two other important posts today, voting to accept Edward Mercado as the new Commissioner of the Division of Human Rights and Roland M. Malan as the new Inspector General of the Metropolitan Transit Authority. Mr. Mercado's salary will be $82,614, while Mr. Malan will earn $102,335.

HEADLINE: Geisha Tradition In Heart of Manhattan;
Clubs Provide a Familiar Atmosphere For Relaxing and Conducting Business

BYLINE: By ASHLEY DUNN 

 BODY:
Sitting in the dimly lighted Club Ohogi around a $150 bottle of Martell Cognac and a tiny plate of peanuts, Isahiro Asami and Fumio Yoshida sip from crystal tumblers as the three hostesses at their table fawn over them, searching for unlighted cigarettes and half-filled glasses. For two hours, the two business executives talk, chat with the hostesses and play bar games.
For all this, the two will pay a $250 tab before sauntering off to the Club Stella a block away. By the end of the night, they will spend several hundred more dollars. The peanuts are free. 
 "It's very relaxing," said Mr. Asami, a jovial, gray-haired printing broker in Manhattan who goes out clubbing with clients twice a week. "This is traditional Japanese-style business."
Paying exorbitant sums for a drink has long been a tradition in places like the Ginza district in Tokyo, where business relationships that will last a lifetime are forged in clubs that cater to men with expense accounts. But over the last two decades, driven by the influx of Japanese executives to America, these exclusive kurabu, as they are known in Japanese, have been transported -- stale peanuts and all -- to a quiet stretch of midtown, just west of the United Nations. Several dozen are scattered over roughly 16 square blocks.
The migration has been so discreet that many people who live nearby have no idea the clubs exist. Usually, the only marker is a tiny plaque, purposely small to keep passers-by, no matter how well heeled, from inadvertently stumbling into this world.
For the legions of executives who stay in the United States only a few years before returning to Japan, the clubs are a welcome taste of home -- a place to relax and engage in ritualized flirting with hostesses that harks back to the days of the geisha.
But in their migration to the West, the clubs also have changed in subtle ways as the geisha traditions of female service clash with the sensibilities of Americanized hostesses.
"It's good money, it's flexible and has short hours, but a lot of women get angry doing this," said Etsuko Kizawa, a hostess at Club Ohogi, who said she is paid about $100 an evening for about five hours' work.
She came to the United States seven years ago to flee the oppression of Japanese society. "I was searching for a paradise in New York," she said, "but I've ended up playing the same old role."
Club Ohogi sits on a quiet block of East 49th Street, just east of Third Avenue, filled with brownstone co-ops and doctors' offices, a street that gets eerily quiet for Manhattan after 8:30 P.M. There is little to indicate a club except for an awning over the front door with the single word Ohogi, in Japanese and English.
"If you don't know, you're not going to know," said Franz Stephens, a doorman at a building across the street who for years watched the groups of businessmen enter the building at night and wondered what went on inside.
Through the front door, up a spiral staircase that winds past a large photograph of a woman's leg, each customer is met by a hostess, dressed for the office, whose standard greeting is to present a business card.
Next to the stairway is a case filled with bottles of Chivas Regal, Johnny Walker Black Label, Martell and other liquors, each bearing the name of the customer who bought it.
The club owner, Takeshi Okazaki, said most Westerners who come with Japanese customers have a hard time grasping what the club is about. At $120 a person just to get inside, some assume that more than drinks and peanuts are offered.
Hostesses said the Ginza-style clubs, where businessmen and hostesses sit at prudish distances from each other, are as innocent as they proclaim, although other Asian clubs may be involved in prostitution.
Officer Steve Cohen of the Manhattan South vice unit said the police had never received any complaints or reports of prostitutions at the Japanese clubs. "They really don't cause a problem," he said.
Mr. Okazaki said the clubs in New York date back 15 to 20 years. When he arrived in New York in 1980 as a salesman for a Japanese chemical company, there were already a dozen in the quiet side streets near the United Nations.
Mr. Okazaki was a typical Japanese executive expected eventually to return home after a few years in the United States. But like thousands of others who have come to this country, he never did.
"Well, my kids wanted to stay," he said. "They liked it here."
He could have stayed as a salesman, but after years of drinking in Ginza-style clubs, he struck out on his own in the club business. He claims, however, "It's not as profitable as you think." The high prices, he said, reflect the expense of paying the hostesses, who receive about $100 a night.
Compared with clubs in Tokyo, said Mr. Asami, the printing broker, the New York clubs are a bargain since going to one of the fanciest in Ginza can cost $600.
But the camaraderie with the client is the same. After spending several hundred dollars on a client and joking together with a young woman for several hours, Mr. Asami said, "When I call them the next morning, there is a different feeling between us."
A former Ginza hostess, who refused to allow her name to be used because she owns a boutique in the West Village, said: "These men really don't know how to relax. That's why they need us."
In Ginza, hostesses at the best clubs are required to read the major newspapers every day and keep up with economic developments. In New York clubs, the requirements are less stringent.
Inside Club Ohogi, the rituals of the hostess can be as formal as a tea ceremony and as bawdy as an afternoon talk show.
As Mr. Asami and Mr. Yoshida, the owner of a Manhattan insurance company that caters to Japanese clients, puff on their cigarettes, Ms. Kizawa delicately places ice cubes in each glass. It is a ceremony that takes minutes to complete.
Then she lifts the bottle of Cognac and pours, after turning the bottle so the label is clearly visible to the men.
After some small talk, she has the table laughing raucously with a game in which everyone at the table has to answer a true-or-false questions by slipping a quarter under a napkin. Heads for true, tails for false.
"O.K., did anyone make love last night?" she asks as the table breaks into laughter.
Ms. Kizawa came to the United States in 1988 to study film making, one of the thousands of young Japanese turning away from the strict regimen of Japanese life.
Her father had worked for a large electronics company all his life, but she saw herself as a rebel.
"I just felt I really didn't fit in there," she said. "By the time I was 15, I already knew I wanted to get out. There wasn't a space for me there."
Like many other young Japanese, she took up the bohemian life in the East Village and became immersed in studying film. For several years, she supported herself by working in Japanese restaurants, but eventually discovered that the best pay came from working at the clubs.
In her search for freedom, she found herself working in the most traditional role she could imagine, which she describes as being a modern geisha.
Last year, she finished a film about her club experience, "New York Geisha." In the film, a student project for the School of Visual Arts, she portrays a harsh and humiliating world in which women grovel before men, laughing at their jokes with forced smiles. In the end, the her protagonist leaves the world of the clubs.
Unlike her film heroine, Ms. Kizawa still works at Club Ohogi three nights a week. It is a job that allows her to work on film projects by day.
"It's not that degrading and it's not dangerous, and I do sometimes make good contacts with people," she said. "It's tolerable and, after three years of this, I'm used to it."

HEADLINE: Manzi Departure Unlikely To Derail I.B.M.'s Plans

BYLINE: By STEVE LOHR 

 BODY:
For I.B.M., the abrupt departure of Jim P. Manzi is less a strategic blow than a sobering reminder of how quickly the human assets of a software company can take flight.
It was less than four months ago that Mr. Manzi, the 43-year-old chief executive of the Lotus Development Corporation, agreed to sell Lotus to I.B.M. for $3.5 billion and join the executive ranks of I.B.M. 
 Most analysts expect other Lotus executives to leave the International Business Machines Corporation in the wake of Mr. Manzi's move. But they say a trickle of departures should have scant effect on I.B.M.'s strategy for making Lotus software -- especially its Notes program -- a vehicle for growth during the next several years.
The real danger, analysts say, would be if there were a wholesale exodus of key Lotus people from I.B.M., like the team of developers behind Notes, which enables computer-linked employees to work in far-flung teams. The head of the Notes team is Ray Ozzie, whom William H. Gates of Microsoft once called "one of the top five programmers in the universe."
"Manzi's departure is not any kind of derailing of I.B.M.'s strategy for Lotus," said Stuart Woodring, an analyst at Forrester Research Inc. in Cambridge, Mass. "But if Ozzie and a few others left, that would be a real problem."
I.B.M. paid cash for Lotus, which means that people like Mr. Ozzie instantly became multimillionaires thanks to their Lotus shares. And despite reports that Mr. Ozzie has a contract to complete two more upgrades of Notes, which could keep him at I.B.M. for another 18 months or so, one executive close to Lotus said there was no contract holding Mr. Ozzie. Mr. Ozzie could not be reached for comment yesterday.
Keeping the key Lotus developers and managers within the I.B.M. fold, and keeping them motivated and productive, is vital if I.B.M. is going to make a success of its software business in the future.
Today, I.B.M.'s sizable software business is largely dependent on the company's mainframe and mini-computer lines, and is growing very little, according to Stephen K. Smith, an analyst for Paine Webber Inc.
Since 1988, I.B.M.'s software revenues have increased by just $1 billion, to $11 billion last year, Mr. Smith estimated. During the same period, he said, the total computer software market has grown to $75 billion from $30 billion.
"I.B.M. desperately needs to get growth from the software business, and that's what the Lotus acquisition was about," Mr. Smith said.
Armed with Lotus Notes, I.B.M. hopes to retain its corporate customers and to finally beat the Microsoft Corporation in an important product category. Despite spending heavily, I.B.M. has been unable to make its OS/2 desktop operating program any kind of a rival to Microsoft's Windows.
Major corporations increasingly want their employees to share documents, reports and financial information across time zones and borders. Lotus Notes is the leading program that enables this kind of teamwork -- a software category called groupware.
Recently, Notes has become a hot product among large industrial companies, banks and high-tech concerns. Installations are expected to double this year to roughly 2.6 million. And significantly for I.B.M., Microsoft has been an uncharacteristic laggard in groupware.
Yet so far, most analysts said, the early signs from the I.B.M.-Lotus merger look encouraging, despite Mr. Manzi's surprise departure. Last July, for example, I.B.M. executives announced that Lotus products like cc:mail, Lotus Organizer and Lotus Approach would be the standard desktop offerings from I.B.M.
"To date, the integration of the two companies is ahead of schedule," said John B. Jones Jr., an analyst for Salomon Brothers Inc.
Investors apparently agreed, shrugging off news of Mr. Manzi's resignation. I.B.M. shares closed yesterday at $92.50, up $1.75.
"The direction of change at I.B.M. is still upward," said Dan Mandresh, an analyst at Merrill Lynch & Company.

HEADLINE: S.E.C. Faults Gibson Greetings's Accounting in Derivatives Deals

BYLINE: By SAUL HANSELL 

 BODY:
Sending a message that companies need to be stricter in the way they account for and control their complex financial dealings, the Securities and Exchange Commission sanctioned Gibson Greetings yesterday for its handling of derivatives trading.
The commission issued a cease-and-desist order against the company, mandating improved controls and better accounting, but did not impose any fines. The S.E.C. typically does not fine publicly held companies for accounting violations because such punishment would fall on the shareholders that the commission is trying to protect. 
 But the action is significant because it comes after Bankers Trust settled S.E.C. charges that it misled Gibson on the risks of derivatives. Gibson, a Cincinnati-based greeting-card company, lost $20.7 million as a result of the derivatives. Bankers Trust, which paid $10 million to settle the commission's complaint, also settled a suit brought by Gibson by agreeing to void $14.5 million of the loss.
"The S.E.C. is telling companies they ought to do much more in disclosing their derivatives activities to the public," said Henry Hu, an expert in derivatives law at the University of Texas at Austin.
Colleen P. Mahoney, deputy director of enforcement for the commission, said, "The fact that Bankers Trust committed fraud in selling derivatives does not absolve Gibson from making sure they have the internal controls necessary to control the risks of these transactions and to account for them accurately on their financial statements."
Accounting experts said the S.E.C. could bring similar charges against other companies that faced derivatives losses, including Procter & Gamble, which is in the middle of a bitter fraud suit against Bankers Trust.
"The cases of Gibson and Procter & Gamble seem very similar," said Michael S. Joseph, a partner with the accounting firm Ernst & Young. But he noted that the commission might not need to bring additional cases to make its point. "They are trying to make a good example of a company, then move on," he said.
Ms. Mahoney of the S.E.C. declined to comment on whether the agency was considering other cases involving derivatives.
Derivatives are contracts with values that are based on -- or derived from -- an underlying financial asset like stocks, bonds or currencies. They are often used by companies to reduce, or hedge, their risks -- for example, to lock in an interest rate on their debt. Derivatives can also be used to invest or speculate on a market's direction.
The commission is expected to propose a more general set of rules in coming weeks about how companies report their derivatives positions.
The S.E.C. said Gibson was speculating on interest rates with derivatives, but was using accounting rules meant for hedging that allowed the gains or losses from the transactions to be postponed until they matured. It found that Gibson should have recorded its profits and losses from the derivatives in each quarter.
The commission also criticized Gibson for not disclosing the nature of the risks of its derivative position in the management discussion and analysis section of its quarterly financial reports.
Separately, it found that by not maintaining adequate internal controls to keep tabs on the risk of its derivatives positions, Gibson violated securities laws that require companies to maintain accurate books and records.
Gibson agreed to the provisions of the S.E.C. order, although it neither admitted nor denied the findings. "We are pleased this matter has been resolved," Benjamin J. Sottile, the company's chairman, said in a statement.

Treasury Prices Mixed; Long Bond's Yield Dips

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
As traders awaited this week's inflation and retail sales data, prices of Treasury securities were mixed yesterday, with the yield on the long bond edging below Tuesday's close.
Traders said they did not expect to see any big changes in the direction of interest rates and that they expect trading to be spotty, with the market staying in a narrow range. 
 The benchmark 30-year bond rose 4/32 , to a price of 10528/32 to yield 6.43 percent, down a basis point from Tuesday. Shorter-maturity bill rates improved a bit, as did intermediate-term notes.
The market did not appear to respond to speeches by Federal Reserve officials, traders said. Alan Blinder, the Fed's vice chairman, appeared before a House Banking Committee and Michael Moskow, president of the Chicago Fed, spoke before an urban affairs group in Chicago. Even with a firm opening in the stock market, there was little response from bonds. On Tuesday, debt futures gave back gains partly in response to a recovery in equities.
Participants expect a favorable tone to bond trading this week, because they are expecting market-friendly data over the next two days in the form of producer prices today and consumer prices and retail sales tomorrow. The Treasury will auction $18.25 billion of new one-year bills today. Yesterday, the rate on the one-year bill was unchanged at 5.29 percent.
Gerald A. Guild, senior vice president of the taxable fixed-income department at Advest Inc.'s New York offices, said the market was clearly treading water yesterday, awaiting fundamental economic data to confirm slow growth and overstated inflation pressures.
"Does the market have potential for a move higher? Yes it does," Mr. Guild said. "I think the next test will be a yield of 6.25 percent on the long bond. Long range, I still expect a new low in interest rates below the 5.79 percent level in October 1993."
Mr. Guild said trading in part had been influenced by budget talks in Washington. "This jawboning will continue too long, which I think will freeze the Federal Open Market Committee from acting on Nov. 15 and maybe Dec. 19," he said. Last November, the F.O.M.C. raised the Fed funds rates 75 basis points. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
Mr. Guild said that a recession could ensue if the Fed waits until December, or later, to ease rates.
In futures trading, the day was just as quiet with the December contract finishing at the previous day's close of 11520/32 , with not much fluctuation.
Stewart Taylor, a fixed-income market analyst for Thomson Research in Boston, said: "Bonds continue to hang at the precipice. The next two to three sessions should prove pivotal to the intermediate- and long-term outlook."
He said that "the related market environment continues to improve, thereby reducing the near-term fundamental risk to bonds."
Municipal bonds were little changed as investors focused on yesterday's $1.2 billion in new issues, including a $420 million Connecticut general obligation bond offering through J. P. Morgan Securities, and $268.5 million of New York State general obligation debt through Bear, Stearns & Company.
The Connecticut debt was rated double-A by Moody's Investors Service and AA- by Standard & Poor's, except for bonds due in 2006 to 2009, which were insured by the Financial Guaranty Insurance Company and rated triple-A. The debt was priced to yield from 3.70 percent in 1996 to 5.70 percent in 2014 and 2015.
Dealers said the New York offer, which was expected to be rated A by Moody's and A- by S.& P., was priced to yield a maximum 5.85 percent for an issue due in 2020, down 5 basis points from its initial pricing because of investor demand. Serial bonds with shorter maturities were priced to yield from 3.85 percent in 1996 to 5.65 percent in 2012.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
French Franc Gains, Mark Falls And the Dollar Is Beneficiary

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
The dollar edged higher yesterday, bolstered by weakness in the German mark.
The mark fell and the French franc rose after the chief prosecutor of Paris told the French Justice Ministry that he would not open a formal judicial investigation of Prime Minister Alain Juppe. 
 The dollar was also aided by a stable Mexican peso and revived stock prices in the United States. The dollar's mild rise against European currencies also helped it gain on the Japanese yen.
In New York trading late yesterday, the dollar rose to 101.07 Japanese yen from 100.88 yen on Tuesday. The dollar rose to 1.4260 marks from 1.4184 marks and to 1.1565 Swiss francs from 1.1485 Swiss francs. The British pound fell to $1.5718 from $1.5771.
The French franc rallied in European trading on the news that Mr. Juppe had escaped the French equivalent of an indictment, which would have forced him to resign. Mr. Juppe had been accused of misusing his office when he was deputy mayor of Paris to obtain cheap housing for himself and his son.
The French franc had been weakened recently by the political uncertainty surrounding the Prime Minister.
The rally in the franc drove the mark lower and helped the dollar, in part because currency traders selling marks sometimes need to sell marks first for dollars before buying other European currencies.
The mark also fell against the Italian lira and the British pound.
"The dollar is really doing a little better because the German mark has eased against European currencies," said John Ryding, a senior economist at Bear, Stearns & Company.
The dollar was also helped by a recovery in American stocks yesterday, after a sharp drop in morning trading on Tuesday rattled currency traders. The Dow Jones industrial average ended 14.45 points higher yesterday.
In addition, the Mexican peso, which fell sharply against the dollar on Tuesday, stabilized yesterday.
The peso was 6.7450 pesos to the dollar yesterday, the same rate as on Tuesday.
"The dollar was obviously bolstered by the Dow" and the peso, said Hugh Walsh, a vice president at ING Capital Markets Inc. "Those two things coupled with all the mark crosses being sold off aggressively" pushed the dollar higher, he said, referring to mark transactions that involved dollar purchases as a first step.

Clinton Backs Funds for World Bank Agency

BYLINE: By PAUL LEWIS 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 11

 BODY:
President Clinton lent his support today to an effort by the world's finance ministers to reverse sweeping Congressional cuts in America's contribution to an international aid agency, but he stopped short of threatening to veto the legislation.
His audience, the finance ministers of the 179 member governments of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, burst into applause as the President called for restoring full American financial support for the World Bank's International Development Association, which provides loans to poor countries. 
 "Restoring funding for the I.D.A. is one of our Administration's top priorities because it is the right thing to do," the President told finance ministers at the 50th annual meeting of the World Bank and the I.M.F. "Of course it serves our interests, but it is the right thing to do."
Still, the President did not say whether he would veto the 1996 foreign aid bill if it does not increase the American contribution for the I.D.A.
On Capitol Hill, an influential legislator said it was too late for the President to get the cut funds restored, complaining that the Administration had delayed getting involved in the struggle when it might have done some good.
"The Administration went missing in action this spring when we were putting this legislation together and needed their help," said Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky. "Now it's too late. The most they will get is the Senate figure and that's not certain." The Senator is chairman of the appropriations subcommittee on foreign operations, the key Senate body handling the I.D.A. funds.
The President's appeal came in a speech in which Mr. Clinton again denounced isolationism in the United States and stressed his Administration's achievements in promoting freer world trade, rescuing Mexico from financial disaster and strengthening the international monetary system.
"Ironically, just when the advantages of expanded trade have become so dramatic, we are again hearing the voices of retreat here in our own country," the President said, adding, "There are those who say that America should simply erect a wall and live within its own borders economically, and when it comes to foreign policy we should just go it alone."
Restoration of full American financing for the I.D.A., which lends to the poorest of the poor for 50 years at only 0.5 percent interest, has become one of the finance ministers' principal demands at this year's World Bank and I.M.F. meetings.
The Clinton Administration has asked Congress for $1.3 billion for the final year of a three-year agreement on financing the I.D.A. This amount represents America's agreed contribution to the $18 billion fund of $1.25 billion this year, plus a small margin for arrears.
But the Senate is only offering to pay $775 million, a cut of about 42 percent in the Administration's request, while the House has appropriated only $575 million. Both houses of Congress say cuts are unavoidable if the Federal budget is to be brought into balance.
While the House wants to hold the total American foreign aid budget to $12 billion this year, compared with $13.9 billion last year, the Senate favors a slightly higher total of $12.3 billion. House and Senate conferees will meet next week to reconcile their differences.
The World Bank staff also fears that any substantial cut in America's I.D.A. contribution this year will raise a serious question about the Administration's ability to help the agency when it runs out of funds next year.

Miami Herald Plans More Cuts in News Staff

BYLINE: By WILLIAM GLABERSON 

 BODY:
The Miami Herald, which has already reduced the size of its news staff this year, announced a series of cost-cutting steps yesterday that will include more newsroom cuts next year.
Like most large newspapers, The Herald is under intense financial pressures. Its publisher, David Lawrence Jr., said its total newsroom staff would shrink to about 415 in 1996 from about 455 earlier this year. The total staff at the paper is to shrink from 2,200 earlier this year to 1,900 by the end of next year. 
 The cuts come as part of a continuing effort to reduce costs at the paper; Mr. Lawrence said that 70 jobs have already been trimmed this year, including some news positions, and that 130 more would be eliminated by the end of the year, though none in the newsroom.
More cuts in news staffing are to come next year, though, when it is to contribute about 20 of an expected 100 jobs to be eliminated.
Management hopes to reduce the staff through an early-retirement program and attrition. Some layoffs are anticipated, Mr. Lawrence said, though none in the newsroom.
Mr. Lawrence also said that the news staff of El Nuevo Herald, the Spanish-language daily published by The Herald, would shrink from 96 earlier this year to 88 next year.
The cutbacks, Mr. Lawrence said yesterday, reflected "the economic realities of our business." The Herald had previously said it would try to cut about $32 million in annual costs, or about 10 percent of its annual revenue of roughly $320 million.
With a daily circulation of about 400,000, The Miami Herald is one of the 25 largest newspapers in the country. Like most big metropolitan papers, it was hit with sharply rising newsprint costs this year as it struggled with increasing competition for advertiser dollars and readers.
Newspaper companies have also been pressed by Wall Street to improve their financial results. The Herald is owned by Knight-Ridder Inc., which also owns The Philadelphia Inquirer, a broadsheet, and The Philadelphia Daily News, a tabloid.
Last week, the publisher of the Philadelphia papers, Robert J. Hall, said job cuts and other cost-cutting moves were being planned there. Mr. Hall did not rule out the possibility of closing The Daily News, which has long struggled financially.
The Knight-Ridder papers have been watched carefully because of a recent change in the company's leadership. P. Anthony Ridder, a longtime executive known for his bottom-line orientation, became chief executive this spring and then chairman this summer after the death of the company's former chairman, James K. Batten.
This summer, Knight-Ridder closed a research center in Colorado that had been set up to explore electronic alternatives to newspaper publication. Some analysts at the time regarded that as a signal that Mr. Ridder's tenure would be marked by sharp new cuts at the company's newspapers.
Mr. Lawrence said the moves in Miami reflected an effort to deal with issues that affect newspapers nationwide. For example, to address what he called "the problem of getting and keeping readers," Mr. Lawrence said that hundreds of the paper's staff members had participated in a strategic planning process.
One result of that planning was described in a memorandum from Mr. Lawrence to the newspaper's staff yesterday. The paper will now "focus its newsroom resources on nine subject areas that readers have told us are especially important and useful: local government; education; sports; environment; consumer news; Florida news; Latin America; health/medicine and crime."

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
Why is a rich country down in the dumps, if it is?

BYLINE: By Peter Passell 

 BODY:
IF the economy is up, why is America down? That question certainly interests President Clinton, who is planning to lead the nation from its funk (assuming it's in one). But it is also the title of the cover article in the October issue of The Atlantic Monthly, the work of three researchers at a left-of-center think tank in San Francisco called Redefining Progress.
The article will no doubt be dismissed by some as a familiar critique of the ways professional bean counters mismeasure economic progress by focusing so intently on the gross domestic product, a barometer designed to measure the total output of goods and services produced by the economy. And in this case, the critique is also spiced with just a pinch of paranoia. But the core of the argument -- that traditional income accounting offers at best an incomplete index of national welfare -- deserves a close look. 
 A different index, termed the "genuine progress indicator" by the authors, is not likely to "transform our society," as the magazine's headline writers suggest. Indeed, recent research suggests that better numbers are as likely to lead to self-satisfaction as outrage. Surely, though, it would be healthy to re-examine the G.D.P. measure, which was never intended as the last word on the economic well-being.
The authors, Clifford Cobb, Ted Halstead and Jonathan Rowe, point out that national income accounting is a relatively new concept whose evolution closely tracks the rise of activist government since the Great Depression. They also point out that implicit in the calculation of income and growth is a lot of conceptual corner-cutting.
With a few exceptions, only goods and services that change hands for money are counted. Consequently, Big Macs add billions to national income but the homemade lasagna they are displacing never shows up. Since leisure isn't bought and sold, the time to read Dickens, run marathons or make love that is lost when someone takes a second job is not weighed against the extra income generated. And since resource depletion and environmental degradation don't rate inclusion for the same reason, the Government effectively "treats the earth as a business in liquidation," they contend.
Most important, perhaps, the income accounts assume that all output generates value equal to its market price, no matter who buys it. Hence the distribution of income has no weight in an index used as a benchmark for economic welfare.
None of this comes as a great shock to William D. Nordhaus and James Tobin of Yale University. A quarter century ago they attempted some revisions of the standard methodology. They found, Mr. Nordhaus said, that "leisure was the most important omission," surprisingly outpacing such factors as pollution and resource depletion.
But is leisure time falling? The explosion of women in the work force along with the rise of day care centers and deliver-anything services suggests that it is. But Dale Jorgenson of Harvard University says more women in the labor force has been offset by an increase in male leisure, as men retire earlier. "Over all," Mr. Jorgenson says, "it's been a wash."
By the same token the resource depletion argument appears to be more sound than fury, at least for America. The Department of Commerce is now tracking changes in subsoil resource wealth as part of a broader project of "green" accounting. And Mr. Nordhaus contends that the impact is effectively zero: depletion is offset by technical change that makes it cheaper to extract minerals.
The news on pollution, yet to be measured as systematically by Washington, may prove even more cheerful. By virtually every benchmark, the air and water are cleaner than a decade ago.
Perhaps the ultimate ace in the hole for the optimists in this debate is an emerging consensus that price indexes overstate inflation -- and thus understate growth. A commission led by Michael J. Boskin recently estimated that the failure to account fully for quality improvements in everything from prescription drugs to autos was falsely adding at least a percentage point annually to the calculation of inflation. And that implies that at least $70 billion is being added each year to income without being counted.
Then there is that issue of income distribution. The rich certainly are getting richer and the poor poorer, in spite of what some House Republicans may say. But even here, it is unclear whether that translates into a fall in national welfare. Mr. Jorgenson argues that consumption is a better measure of welfare than income, and consumption, he insists, is no less equally distributed than it was in the 1970's.
Why, then, are Americans in the dumps? Perhaps they aren't. Or perhaps they are in a pensive mood after the cold war and not able to come to terms with a rapidly changing culture no longer united by a common enemy. "It's a new world out there," Mr. Jorgenson said, "not a worse one."

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS;
A Payoff for Clinton's Helping Hand to Mexico

BYLINE: By PETER PASSELL 

 BODY:
This week's White House visit of Mexico's embattled President, Ernesto Zedillo, no doubt stirred painful memories in Washington. Just 14 months after strong-arming the North American Free Trade Agreement through Congress, President Clinton was forced to scrounge $52 billion to save Mexico from a financial crisis -- a rescue widely viewed as a bailout for Wall Street and a symbol of the Administration's inept foreign policy.
But economists are inclined to interpret these events far more kindly. By most criteria Mr. Clinton's decision to act as lender of last resort has apparently paid off. While Mexico's recession has been deeper than expected and unemployment remains punishingly high, exports have surged. And in spite of pessimistic predictions from critics of the bailout, Mexico has managed to refinance the short-term debts that led it to the brink of default without exhausting its line of credit with the United States Treasury. The Union Bank of Switzerland, among others, is predicting a return to modest economic growth next year financed in part with imported capital that had fled Mexico only months ago. 
 Without help, Mexico would have been forced to default on debts to foreigners -- mostly American mutual funds. And while it may not be Washington's responsibility to bail out Wall Street, much more was at stake.
"Default would have meant chaos," said Lawrence Krohn, a senior economist at the Union Bank of Switzerland, isolating Mexican business from international markets, setting back Mexico's leap to modernity, and creating problems for other merging economies in Latin America and Asia.
Most economists agreed that Nafta was oversold as a jobs program, and they wished the Administration had been able to stir Mexico to act before the collapse of the peso last December. But over all, the economists give Mr. Clinton high marks for leadership.
In the view of Robert D. Hormats, an Assistant Secretary of State in the Reagan Administration, the rescue of Mexico in the face of Congressional opposition and European indifference was "Bill Clinton's finest hour."
Robert Z. Lawrence, an economist at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government, said Nafta meant more to Mexico because trade barriers between the two countries were already low. "What really distinguished Nafta," he said, "was the emphasis on foreign investment," which locked in the rights of American business to compete on equal terms in a country long inclined toward xenophobia.
Where the Clinton Administration erred was in creating unrealistic expectations about new jobs for Americans -- expectations that have left many with the sense that Nafta is a failure. The gains from freer trade are generally measurable in lower consumer prices and better-paying jobs, not more jobs, said Jagdish Bhagwati, an economics professor at Columbia University. Total employment is largely controlled by the Federal Reserve, which uses monetary policy to balance the benefits from faster growth against the risks of accelerating inflation.
But Mr. Bhagwati is sympathetic with the political reasoning that led the Administration to brandish rosy economic analyses in support of Nafta. "You might as well get credit for creating jobs with exports if the other side is going to hammer you with jobs lost to imports," he said.
From this perspective, President Clinton's errors in ramming through the agreement were purely tactical. Indeed, at the time, passage of the enabling legislation was widely hailed as a triumph of national interest over the parochial concerns of the President's allies in Congress.
But memories clouded shortly thereafter. To critics, the fact that Mexico was importing far, far more than it was exporting though the 1990's should have set off alarm bells in the Clinton Administration, especially after the assassination of Luis Donaldo Colosio, the ruling party's candidate for President, in March 1994, when the torrent of dollars going to Mexico abruptly stopped.
After the Mexican election in August, President Clinton should have read the riot act to President Carlos Salinas, then a lame duck, to put on the economic brakes. But in what is probably the most careful dissection of these events to date, Jeffrey Sachs and Aaron Tornell of Harvard along with Andres Velasco of New York University see this conventional wisdom as a series of half-truths that at very least make it a stretch to blame the Clinton Administration.
Mexico's heavy dependence on imported capital in the 1990's seemed as much a confirmation of belief in the Mexican economic miracle as it was a warning that "import led" economic development could not be sustained. Indeed, telltale signs of profligacy were hard to find: The Mexican Government's budget was in surplus in every year from 1990 through 1994. What's more, the economy as a whole appeared creditworthy. Though private businesses in Mexico were borrowing heavily, the interest they owed, measured as a percentage of export earnings, fell steadily from 30 percent in 1986 to 11 percent in 1993.
The events in the months preceding the collapse bear closer examination. Numerous accounts suggest that the technocrats advising President Salinas were aware that dwindling foreign currency reserves after August 1994 would eventually force a tighter monetary policy or a devaluation of the peso -- and that the Clinton Administration was urging action sooner rather than later. But it should not be entirely surprising that warnings from United States Treasury officials failed to bring radical action. "While the danger was clear," Mr. Tornell said, "a crisis never seemed inevitable."
Once the panic set in, was it necessary for the Clinton Administration to put tens of billions of dollars of taxpayers' money at risk to contain it?
Although they never managed to explain how Nafta and the run on the peso were linked, senior Congressional Democrats certainly made no secret of their view that it was all a matter of the chickens coming home to roost. And after it was clear that the President could not count on strong support from his own party, key Republicans -- notably Alfonse M. D'Amato of New York, chairman of the Senate Banking Committee -- joined the chorus contending that aid was nothing more than a bailout for Wall Street. That forced the Administration to tap contingency funds set aside to defend the dollar against currency fluctuations, a move that Congressional leaders have warned they would never again allow.
Mr. Velasco of New York University said that lending to the Mexican Government was akin to lending to a bank whose assets far exceed its liabilities but could not come up with the cash overnight to pay off panicked depositors. "It hasn't cost the American taxpayers a penny," he notes. Nor, for that matter, was there ever much risk that it would: under the loan agreement, Washington had first claim on Mexico's oil revenues in the event of a default.
Default, however, has also been likely to create panic in other emerging markets that depend on foreign capital, Mr. Hormats suggested. "The contagion effect would have been felt from Brazil to Thailand," he said.

HEADLINE: Eco-Privy: Bringing Outdoor Plumbing Indoors

BYLINE: By PATRICIA LEIGH BROWN 

 BODY:
SOMEWHERE on the Eastern Seaboard, in a house whose residents prefer to remain anonymous, is perhaps the most revolutionary "bathroom" in America. It is not really a bathroom, but rather an indoor wetlands, constructed in specially designed tanks in a greenhouse, in which aerobic microbes, snails, fish, hibiscus and splendiferous wetland plants of nearly every description have been recruited to do the deed that a septic tank used to do.
This surreptitious biological sewage system is not legal inside single-family homes yet (and it's doubtful snails will ever replace Sani-Flush). But in these ecologically trying times, perhaps no design problem is as poignant as the quest for the perfect toilet. 
 Around the country, homeowners and communities fed up with overdevelopment, contaminated ground water and overflowing septic tanks are turning to novel solutions to dispose of waste ecologically. Although their numbers remain small, they are growing, as more stringent laws proliferate, like Title 5 in Massachusetts, which requires homeowners with on-site septic systems to meet new environmental and public health standards before building an addition or selling a house.
Those in search of the trenches of eco-design need look no further than the constructed wetlands that are popping up in hundreds of backyards across the country, among people who wouldn't previously have considered themselves "green." In place of conventional drain or leach fields, wetland plants like cattails, reeds and bamboo are sprouting. Unlike a conventional septic system, the water is not destined simply to go into the ground, but rather to be absorbed by the roots of plants.
Others are turning to composting toilets, which use peat moss and sawdust in place of water. In Taos, N.M., one group has even begun marketing a build-it-yourself solar toilet. They have borrowed the motto of the Starship Enterprise: "To boldly go where no man has gone before."
"We have to get beyond flush-and-forget technology," said Sim Van der Ryn, founder of the nonprofit Ecological Design Institute in Sausalito, Calif., and author of "The Toilet Papers: Recycling Waste and Conserving Water."
"The main bent is to deal with one's own waste as close to the source as possible," Mr. Van der Ryn said.
At Sam and Wendy Hitt's house in Santa Fe, N.M., on a patch of semiarid land once farmed by the Anasazi Indians, the sight of cattails and bulrushes amid the wild sage and chamisa "does stand out," Ms. Hitt said. She and her husband, the director of Forest Guardians, a forest conservation organization, moved into a house with what she called a terrible septic system and drain field. "We wanted to try something different that had less impact on the land," she said.
Waste water is piped from the Hitts' conventional septic tank to a specially designed lined bed layered with water, gravel and vegetation. As it moves slowly through this wetland, chemical reactions and microbial activity in the plants absorb and assimilate harmful substances, including nitrogen and phosphorous compounds that can cause rampant algae growth and might otherwise be pollutants. Solids remain in the septic tank. The system is designed so that the waste water remains underground during the weeklong process, without providing malodorous competition to the intoxicating scent of Santa Fe pinon. Once the water is purified (recyclable but not drinkable), it meanders on to the Hitts' drip-water irrigation system that nourishes the squaw bush and ponderosa pines they have planted as a windbreak.
In places like Taos County, where uncontrolled growth has resulted in ground water pollution from septic tanks, the backyard wetland trend is in its infancy, but "growing rapidly," said Alfred Krause, a water expert with the Environmental Protection Agency in Chicago. Current estimates range from 800 to 3,000 individual systems nationwide, most in Kentucky, Mississippi and Louisiana, states that have detailed guidelines. Between 400 and 500 communities have built wetlands on a broader scale as a more natural alternative to conventional sewage treatment plants, he said.
At the Arcata Marsh and Wildlife Sanctuary in Northern California, residents in 1986 inaugurated their new sewage system, which is ringed with bird watchers with spotting scopes on busy days, by holding a Flush With Pride festival.
One problem with individual, backyard wetlands is cost, at least initially. Morton Nilssen, a residential specialist with the Southwest Wetlands Group in Santa Fe, said a backyard wetland is about two and a half times as expensive to set up as a traditional septic system. Wetlands also need nurturing, preferably by a specialist trained to guide a natural system.
The advantages may be greater for a small community. In a study of 30 ecological treatment plants, construction costs were from 10 to 50 percent lower than for a conventional sewage treatment plant, Mr. Krause said. They are also easier to operate and do not require tons of concrete and large amounts of chemicals.
In Indiana, the state's Department of Health has classified backyard wetlands as experimental systems that must be monitored by county health departments. The LaGrange County Department of Public Health began a constructed-wetland program for single-family homes last month, spurred by a public health crisis from contaminated ground water that has caused upper respiratory and gastrointestinal disorders in the county. Septic tank technology invented in 1874 has been stretched beyond the limit as the population expands, said Bill Grant, the county administrator.
His department now provides homeowners with blueprints. A wetland for a typical three-bedroom house would be about 14 feet by 25 or 30 feet, about the size of the floor space in a two-car garage.
"Constructed wetlands are probably not the last word, but we've got to start someplace," Mr. Grant said.
An impediment to this and other unconventional approaches has been what he calls a "by-the-book mentality," a Catch-22 patchwork of regulations, which vary from county to county.
But the problem remains this, Mr. Krause said: "Every day, under the best of circumstances, we use 1.6 gallons of drinking water to flush half a pint of waste."
Ultimately, Mr. Krause said, economics, including the phasing out of Federal construction grants for local waste-water treatment, may force Americans to consider the alternatives. These include composting toilets, which allow bacteria and fungi to break down waste to humus, and are harvested about once a year. Composting toilet enthusiasts number only in the thousands.
David Del Porto, founder of Sustainable Strategies, a Concord, Mass., ecological engineering firm, calls composting toilets "the natural cycle, writ small."
The grandmother of composting toilets is the Clivus Multrum (a Latin-Swedish amalgam that means "inclining compost room"), developed in Sweden in the 1930's. The Clivus is distributed in the United States by a company run by Abby Rockefeller, David Rockefeller's daughter.
Many of the compact toilets look like glorified potties. There are other psychological hurdles, even among former hippies like J. Baldwin, a senior editor of The Whole Earth Review in Sausalito, who has lived in a converted chicken coop. "If you can't get your teen-ager to clean up his or her own room, what is going to happen with the composting toilet?" he asked.
John Douglas and Joan Waltermire, a graphic designer and museum curator in Vershire, Vt., who have had a Norwegian composting toilet for 10 years, remember the first time they emptied it, with a shovel and much trepidation. "It smelled like forest soil!" he said. "The only problem was, the instructions were in Norwegian."
Mr. Krause of the E.P.A. said, "Some composting toilets work marvelously, some abominably." In an ideal world, he said, composting collectors would be as ubiquitous as garbage collectors. But he wondered, "Is America ready for the Good Humus man?"
At the least, homeowners can consider replacing old plumbing fixtures with low-flow toilets and shower heads, as was done citywide in San Simeon, Calif., where water use was cut by 50 percent, he said.
A poetic alternative is the "living machine" concept pioneered by John Todd, a Massachusetts biologist and an advocate of living more lightly on the land.
At Corkscrew Swamp, a National Audubon Society sanctuary near Naples, Fla., visitors can experience a living machine. To get to the bathroom, they walk through an aluminum screened enclosure into what seems to be a garden, a space with plastic tanks and lined trenches brimming with native marsh plants and species. These natural decomposers -- what Jan Beyea, an Audubon senior scientist, calls "nature's wonderful garbage men" -- purify the waste water, 90 percent of which is then recycled for yet another flush.
The E.P.A., which has financed four living-machine demonstration projects across the country, awaits results of an independent study to determine whether their performance is "sustainable over the years," said Robert Bastian, a senior environmental scientist with the E.P.A.
But the living machine already has its passionate adherents, including the cartoonist Jim Davis of "Garfield the Cat" fame, who has installed a Solar Aquatic system, a type of living machine, in a large greenhouse in Indiana on the property of his studio, Paws Inc. It is operated by a full-time horticulturist, Russ Vernon, who describes his job as "taking care of Garfield's litter box."
His system, designed by Ecological Engineering Associates of Marion, Mass., uses photosynthesis to speed the purification process by holding artificial ponds and marshes in translucent solar tanks. The constant flow keeps show-quality orchids blooming.
Because the technology is still considered experimental, Mr. Davis ran the risk of being shut down by the state if clean water requirements were not met. But so far, he said, "it's performed like a champion."
He added: "The only thing that's stopping the growth of this kind of operation is tradi tional thinking."

HEADLINE: Business Said to Put More In Arts

BYLINE: By WILLIAM GRIMES 

 BODY:
Business support for arts organizations in the United States reached an estimated $875 million last year, according to a survey released today by the Business Committee for the Arts, a nonprofit organization that encourages corporate investment in the arts. The figure represents a big jump from the $518 million in the committee's last survey, conducted in 1991 and published in 1992, and a shift in spending toward arts education and performing-arts centers at the expense of museums and conventional theaters.
The survey, presented in "The B.C.A. Report: 1995 National Survey of Business Support to the Arts," found that 47 percent of businesses supported the arts, compared with 37 percent in 1991, and that businesses devoted an average of 19 percent of their philanthropic budgets to the arts, up from 11 percent in 1991. 
 Symphony orchestras accounted for the largest single percentage of arts spending (15 percent), followed by multi-use performing-arts centers (13 percent), museums (12 percent), theaters (11 percent) and arts education (1 percent). Regionally, the Northeast led in arts support, followed by the South (including Texas), the Midwest and the West.
Perhaps most striking were the findings that about three-quarters of arts spending was by small to medium-size companies with annual revenue of less than $50 million, and that 93 percent of the money went to local arts organizations. Both figures, virtually unchanged from 1992, reflect trends that the committee has tracked over the long term.
The two statistics may have a causal relationship. "About a decade ago we decided these companies were the future for arts support," said Judith A. Jedlicka, the president of Business Committee for the Arts, referring to smaller businesses.
A variety of economic studies and forecasts, she said, strongly suggest that smaller businesses will begin playing a larger role in economic life and in cultural support. "If you haven't got a vibrant arts environment, it's tough to get people to work and live in your community," she said.
The heads of several nonprofit arts groups reached yesterday expressed surprise at the overall increase, saying that their corporate support had remained flat or declined over the last several years. The business committee's survey does not contradict that perception. It shows that corporate giving remained the same or decreased for symphonies, museums and theaters, while increasing for more populist and educational purposes like the multi-use performing-arts centers and arts education programs.
"Our last report, through fiscal 1994, indicated virtually flat giving as far as corporate donations to theaters is concerned," said Barbara Janowitz, the director of management and government programs at the Theater Communications Group, which represents 320 nonprofit professional theaters across the country. "Adjusted for inflation, theaters actually lost a percentage point over the last 5 years."
Ms. Jedlicka said: "The perception depends on the discipline. The performing-arts centers represent some very large grants."
When asked to give the main reasons why they supported the arts, 73 percent of the companies said in the report that they wanted to "demonstrate good corporate citizenship." That figure was up from 40 percent in 1991. Other reasons were to enhance the quality of life in the community (66 percent) and to enhance the company's image and reputation (46 percent).
The respondents were asked to list factors that would influence their arts support in the future. Somewhat surprisingly, more companies cited the level of executive interest in the arts as a factor than the money available.
At the same time, the survey revealed a broadening of the decision-making process when it comes to arts support. In 1991, 82 percent of businesses reported that the chairman, chief executive officer or partner made decisions about charitable giving. In 1994, that figure dropped to 76 percent. Companies in which such decisions are made by a charitable contributions department or committee jumped from 4 percent in 1991 to 27 percent, and those by employee committees from 2 percent to 14 percent.
The total dollar figure in 1991 reflected the negative effect of the economic recession, which caused corporate giving to dip to $518 million from $634 million in 1989. In the committee's first survey, conducted in 1967, total corporate giving was $22 million.
The rise in corporate philanthropy comes at a time when Federal dollars for the arts are dwindling. The budget of the National Endowment for the Arts was cut from $162.2 million this year to $99.5 million next year.
State and local arts agencies have increased their budgets modestly in the last two years after a steep decline from a peak of $280.9 million in 1990 to $210 million in 1992, according to a survey of 56 state and special jurisdictional arts agencies carried out by the National Assembly of State Arts Agencies in Washington. As of April 1995, state and local arts budgets had risen to $259.5 million.
The New York State Council on the Arts, however, has experienced a budget cut, from $31.8 million in 1995 to $28.5 million next year. Typically, arts organizations receive about 10 percent of their budgets from public sources.
The business committee survey, conducted by Roper Starch Worldwide, was based on telephone interviews with 1,000 businesses with annual revenue of $1 million or more. The $875 million figure is a projection from the survey data. It was arrived at by multiplying the percentage of businesses that made cash grants (45 percent) by the current Dun & Bradstreet estimate of the number of businesses with revenue of at least $1 million (972,653). The resulting figure, 437,694, was then multiplied by the median donation for the companies surveyed by the committee, which was $2,000.

HEADLINE: Saving the Tarrytown Riverbank

 BODY:
The Hudson River, with its breathtaking panoramas, is one of the world's great waterways. But its riverbanks suffer the legacy of an era when the Hudson was valued more as an industrial site than as a natural wonder. As industry moves out, local and state governments need to move forcefully to see that these big pieces of riverbank are used well. They are a natural resource of great potential.
Such an opportunity now exists in North Tarrytown. First built in 1898, the General Motors assembly plant on the village's riverfront is the company's oldest. The plant will close next fall, and its minivan assembly operations will be moved to Georgia. For the past two years the company and the villages of Tarrytown and North Tarrytown have been trying to work out the terms of G.M.'s departure from the 98-acre site. 
 Ten years ago the state, Westchester County and the village of North Tarrytown persuaded G.M. to stay. The company was taken off the tax rolls in return for a commitment to a schedule of payments to the village and the school district, which takes in both the Tarrytowns. Voters also approved a $30 million bond issue for G.M. to build a paint plant.
Despite that agreement, the company now plans to vacate the site. It can pay off the bonds at any time and the property will revert to the company for $1. It is unlikely that another industrial enterprise will move in. Big industry has been leaving the area in recent years, and polls have shown that local residents would prefer the land to be put to another use. But with a large, sprawling industrial plant and possibly polluted soil from years of car-making, the site is unattractive.
With that in mind, the village passed a law last year requiring any relocating company to remove all hazards and post a bond to cover the cost of demolishing buildings and removing hazardous waste. It was the first law of its kind in New York State. Last November, G.M. sought an injunction. It withdrew the suit last month, and is now negotiating with the village to work out a deal.
North Tarrytown's Mayor, Sean Treacy, dreams of a waterfront development including some houses, a deep-water dock with a ferry service to New York City, a marina, shops and restaurants. But to attract a developer to help realize that dream, the site will need to be cleaned up. A village-owned park is already under construction next door to the G.M. site.
G.M. has been a part of the North Tarrytown community for almost a century. It benefited from a special bond issue. Its impending departure is already causing economic hardship as workers are laid off in preparation for the move. The company owes it to this small village, and to the region, to help with the transition and to leave the site clean.
North Tarrytown hopes to escape the fate of other towns along the riverbank that are stuck with the decaying hulks of defunct industry on land they cannot control, or have fallen victim to wrongheaded development. The old Anaconda plant in Hastings is an egregious eyesore blighting the riverbank and the town. Another is the uninhabited pink high-rise monstrosity across the river in Nyack. Friends of the river are trying in all these places to reclaim its banks and remake its image. They deserve all the help they can get.

HEADLINE: A Hard-Hearted Tax Bill

 BODY:
The Senate Finance Committee is debating a tax bill that does everything wrong. It promotes consumption rather than savings. It cuts taxes on the rich and raises them on the poor. It creates tax shelters for corporations. It widens the deficit by $245 billion, meaning that important social programs would be vulnerable to later efforts to reduce that deficit.
The only nice thing to say about the Senate Republicans' plan is that it is better than the House plan. There are moderate Republicans who might try to pull the bill even closer to fiscal responsibility before it emerges from committee. Here are several ways to ameliorate the bill's harmful impact. 
 Capital gains: The Republicans want to encourage investment by cutting nearly in half the tax on capital gains -- the profit on the sale of stocks, bonds and property. The cut is unwarranted because capital gains income is already favored by a lower tax rate. In addition, investors can postpone paying taxes on the rising value of stocks and real estate until they decide to sell, whereas taxes on wage and interest earnings are due each year.
Further, the G.O.P. proposal would give the new tax break to owners of old investments, a needless giveaway. At the very least, the committee should restrict the tax cut to assets that investors buy in the future. The committee should also reject a House proposal to index the capital gains tax so that investors are protected from inflation. Indexation might make sense, but only if interest payments are indexed at the same time. If Congress insists on treating different types of assets differently, then it will unintentionally create get-rich schemes for sophisticated investors.
Child credits: Republicans propose to hand out a $500 tax credit per child to families earning up to, in some versions, $200,000. Families too poor to owe tax get nothing. It is anticipated that parents will spend almost all of the credit. That would be a great idea if what America needed was more consumption. However, the economy needs savings. The committee could make the provision fair by extending it to poor families, and limit the overall damage by restricting the credit to families earning $75,000 or less. Even better, the credit could be made temporary.
Corporate taxes: House Republicans want to raise the deduction that corporations are permitted to take on investment in plant and equipment. The proposed deduction would be so large that corporations could invest in money-losing projects, yet walk away with a profit after cashing in the additional tax deduction. The added deduction amounts to telling corporations to get rich by making bad investments. This provision ought to be scrapped.
The Republicans also propose to wipe out the minimum tax that corporations have to pay no matter how many shelters they are able to exploit. Ideally, Congress should remove unwarranted shelters. But until that happens, the minimum tax is needed.
Earned income tax credits: The committee would cut back a credit that goes to low-paid workers to keep them out of poverty. The G.O.P. says the program is riddled with fraud. They exaggerate. Besides, Congress can go after fraud without going after the millions of families that rely on the credit to stay off welfare.
The best choice, of course, would be for the Senate to shelve any tax cut until it can prove that it knows how to balance the existing budget without wrecking the safety net for the needy or public investments. A smaller tax cut would threaten worthwhile Government programs less. Unfortunately, there are too few votes for paring the tax cut below $245 billion. Therefore, the best outcome that one can now hope for would seem to be a bill reworked in committee that includes a trimmed-down capital gains tax cut and a targeted child credit, keeps the earned income credit and omits new corporate loopholes.
Such a bill would still, on balance, be weighted against the poor and against savings. But it would not be nearly as damaging as the measure that emerged from the House.

HEADLINE: Saving the Galapagos

BYLINE: By Marc Miller and Donald Kennedy; Marc Miller, a law professor at Emory University, is a visiting scholar at Stanford University, where Donald Kennedy is a professor of environmental science.

DATELINE: STANFORD, Calif.

 BODY:
Charles Darwin would be appalled. The ecosystem of the Galapagos Islands, where he gathered evidence crucial to his theory of natural selection, is threatened by angry fishermen.
Perhaps the world is ignoring the threat because the islands, 600 miles off the coast of Ecuador, are in the middle of nowhere. Partly because it is isolated, the archipelago forms a cornucopia of biological diversity and a laboratory for studies of evolution in action. 
 In 1959, Ecuador's Government declared more than 95 percent of the island a national park and put careful safeguards on the unique flora and fauna, for example, limiting visitors to fixed paths and requiring the use of trained naturalists as guides. Despite a long history of the introduction of alien species, including goats, rats and some plants, most of the archipelago is in remarkably pristine condition -- for the moment.
But tensions between mainland Ecuador and the islanders are mounting. Earlier this year, Eduardo Veliz, the islands' sole delegate to the National Congress, sponsored a bill that would have shifted administrative power to the Galapagos residents and reduced protection for the ecosystem.
It passed in the Congress, but on Sept. 1, President Sixto Duran Ballen vetoed it. A few days later, protesters wielding machetes and supported by the mayor of the largest town, Puerto Ayora, seized the Charles Darwin Research Station and the national park headquarters. They closed two airports that serve the archipelago. The Government sent in troops and calmed the situation. It also agreed to talk with the protesters about their grievances. Their demands included the signing of the bill, control of local government, a requirement that all visitors spend at least one night ashore and the dismissal of the park superintendent because he opposed a shift to local control.
 The islanders' anger at the Government has been building since December, when the Government closed a lucrative fishery for sea cucumbers, which are exported for use in Asian cooking, after the legal harvesting limit was vastly exceeded. The fishermen seized the Darwin station but didn't harm anyone.
The sea cucumber fishery is only one of several industries that have threatened the islands' ecosystem. The Ecuadorian Government also banned the shark fishing industry because the fishermen killed sharks, took the fins and let the rest of the carcass rot.
But this is not the familiar story of poor locals whose need for economic development is being fought by affluent outside conservationists. Long-term residents have relied on agriculture and subsistence fishing. And their economic future will be improved more by preserving the ecosystem and promoting tourism than by exports of extracted natural resources.
The Government is negotiating with the islanders on providing economic advantages. But conservation is not negotiable. The ecological threat goes well beyond the overfishing of the sea cucumbers. At least 90 of the famed giant tortoises have been killed in recent years, and a major fire, probably arson, destroyed parts of the largest island. Fishermen have camped on some islands illegally and have destroyed a critical mangrove habitat.
The protesters have threatened further arson -- and hostage-taking -- if their demands are not met. Neutralizing this threat and protecting an area crucial to our understanding of nature and humans' place in it should be high on the agenda this week as Timothy Wirth, the Undersecretary of State for Global Affairs, visits Ecuador.

HEADLINE: Storms Expose Florida's Vulnerability

BYLINE: By MIREYA NAVARRO 

DATELINE: MIAMI, Oct. 12

 BODY:
This year's Atlantic hurricane season, on its way to becoming the most active on record, has pounded Florida with wind, rain and the realization that despite what the state learned from Hurricane Andrew, it is still no match for Mother Nature.
Hurricane Andrew, the most expensive natural disaster in the nation's history, landed a single knockout punch on South Florida in August 1992, destroying 85,000 homes, displacing 250,000 people and causing more than $30 billion in property damage. After the storm, Florida officials revamped their statewide disaster response strategy, improved emergency communications and made each county come up with its own hurricane preparedness and mutual aid plan. 
 Then came this year's hurricane season -- with 17 storms so far, 10 of them hurricanes. And the succession of storms has exposed the state's most vulnerable spots: an insurance market in crisis, inadequate construction, population growth in coastal areas that hampers evacuations and increases the insurance risk and, despite significant improvements, some weaknesses in disaster planning.
The 1995 season, which has also caused destruction in Alabama, the Carolinas, Georgia and Texas and has hit Mexico and small Caribbean islands even harder, has prompted renewed calls for a national disaster fund. In addition, it has called attention to the differences between Federal financing for hurricane research and aid, and that for earthquakes. While most earthquakes have historically been less destructive, according to research by the National Hurricane Center here, more money is spent to study and prepare for them than for hurricanes.
"This hurricane season has, probably better than any other, shown that we can no longer treat hurricanes and insurance and issues of development and zoning as if they're acute problems" to be dealt with after each disaster, said Walter G. Peacock, an associate sociology professor at Florida International University here.
"These are long-term, chronic issues that can't sit on the back burner without dire consequences," said Mr. Peacock, who heads the faculty committee for the university's new Center for Hurricane Damage Research and Mitigation.
The 1995 season began with Hurricane Allison, the earliest such storm to come ashore in the United States in more than a century. That storm hit Florida's Gulf Coast in June, only five days into the season, and caught many residents without supplies or an escape plan.
In August, Hurricane Erin spared South Florida but threatened it long enough to uncover flawed preparation plans in Dade County shelters, causing the downfall of an emergency manager who had been regarded as a hero in Hurricane Andrew.
And Hurricane Opal, which intensified in a matter of a few hours on Oct. 4, prompted a huge traffic jam in the Florida Panhandle as thousands of people tried to flee.
Not since 1933, when 21 storms occurred, has the northwestern coast of Africa lobbed so many storms into the Atlantic. Last year was so calm, with only four storms and three hurricanes, that 32,000 Cubans set out to cross the Straits of Florida on rafts and small boats.
But officials at the National Hurricane Center say the last two decades have been abnormally quiet. Meteorologists expect more hurricane activity, and its associated problems, over the next 25 years.
The improvements that Florida made after Hurricane Andrew generally served the state well this year. Hurricane Opal, the worst of the season so far here, caused only 2 deaths out of 20 that occurred in other parts of the Southeast and 10 in Mexico.
But the season also exposed Florida's remaining weaknesses. With few exceptions, Mr. Peacock said, building codes have not been strengthened or residential development scrutinized more to respond to the threat of hurricanes. State insurance department officials say the storms showed that much of the construction does not even meet current standards.
After Hurricane Andrew, half a dozen insurance companies went bankrupt, rates increased 63 percent and the state stepped in as the insurer of last resort to become Florida's third-largest home insurer. And the market remains in crisis.
In August, State Farm, the largest insurer in Florida, announced that it would not write new homeowner policies. The decision resulted from the busy hurricane season, said Steve Vogel, a company spokesman, who added, "This series of storms reminds us how at risk Florida is."
Even at the National Hurricane Center, there was soul-searching after Hurricane Erin hit the Florida Panhandle and killed 11 people. Residents accused forecasters of letting them go to bed thinking the storm was headed for Gulfport, Miss., only to wake up and find it so close that there was no time to evacuate.
Robert Burpee, director of the hurricane center, said the forecasts were accurate and gave "a fairly good lead time" to prepare. But Mr. Burpee added that since that experience, state and Federal emergency officials now report to the center whenever a storm approaches "to try to insure there's no communication gap between us and emergency managers" who order evacuations.
The biggest concern for state officials is complacency and late public reaction to a hurricane warning, which is the highest level of alert and is issued 24 hours before a storm is expected to hit land.
With Hurricane Opal, state emergency officials said, tens of thousands of people between Panama City and Pensacola left at the same time, only after the winds ofthe approaching hurricane reached 150 miles an hour. Those fleeing created such gridlock on Interstate 10, the principal east-west highway, that many went back or pulled off to seek other shelter.
Generally, only those living on the coast, in mobile homes or low-lying areas are supposed to evacuate. But many others leave, too.
The season also highlighted the vulnerability of the Florida peninsula. More than three-fourths of Florida's residents live on a coastline; in the last decade, their numbers rose to 10.1 million from 7.9 million, out of a total state population of 12.9 million. Recent demographic studies estimate that Florida now has 14 million residents.
"People don't move to Florida to live in the middle of the pine trees," said Jo Miglino, a spokeswoman for the State Division of Emergency Management.
In densely populated South Florida, the early warnings of Hurricane Erin sent residents home from work and rushing to grocery and hardware stores. The storm bypassed populous Dade County but exposed flaws in disaster planning, particularly a lack of emergency food and supplies in shelters for the elderly and those with special needs.
In the controversy that ensued, Kate Hale, the Dade County emergency management director, lost her job. Ms. Hale had gained national attention shortly after Hurricane Andrew when she went on television and demanded Federal relief, asking, "Where in the hell is the cavalry on this one?"
After Hurricane Erin, she said it was difficult to deal with a large elderly population during a hurricane when money for emergency programs has been dwindling. "There were no resources to address the need," Ms. Hale said. "It's a problem in all of Florida."
But state officials say most problems can be addressed with adequate planning. This year's season, which ends on Nov. 30, has sent officials back to the drawing boards to study ways to alleviate traffic congestion during evacuations.
State insurance officials, who said insured losses for Hurricane Erin were estimated at $350 million and for Hurricane Opal at $1.8 billion, plan to draft legislation based on recently released recommendations of a task force that focused on how to avoid an economic catastrophe if another storm like Hurricane Andrew should hit.
But some Floridians are rethinking their decision to live in one of the nation's fastest-growing states.
"About half my clients want to leave," said Elaine Bell, a clinical social worker in Homestead, which took the brunt of Hurricane Andrew three years ago. "They are not only scared, but tired of having to keep an eye on the weather all the time."
 
 
 
HOW IT WORKS: Beyond Jennifer and Jason
 The Atlantic region hurricane season, which runs from June 1 through November 30, has been so active this year that for the first time it risks running out of names for storms.
 Storms are named in alphabetical order -- this season is currently up to Roxanne -- but names beginning with Q, U, X, Y and Z are excluded because of their scarcity. That means this year's list only has four names left: Sebastien, Tanya, Van and Wendy. National Hurricane Center officials say any subsequent storm would be named after the Greek alphabet, starting with Alpha.
 Hurricanes were first named in 1950 but since 1979 the World Metereological Organization has used six lists of names that alternate gender and are recycled every six years. The 1995 season's list was last used in 1989. Only if a hurricane is particularly devastating, like Hugo in 1989 and Andrew in 1992, a name is retired for at least ten years to avoid confusion in legal actions, insurance claims, studies and other documents that may arise in their aftermath.
 The name lists reflect regional and language differences. In the Atlantic region, which includes the United States, the Caribbean, Central America and parts of South America, English, Spanish and French are spoken, so its storms go by "Allison," "Pablo" and "Gabrielle." In the Central Pacific region, which includes the Hawaiian islands, people brace for "Akoni," "Lala" and "Halola."
 Names, which are given at the point a tropical disturbance intensifies into a tropical storm with winds of more than 39 miles per hour, must be easy to pronounce and politically and culturally sensitive, said Frank C. Lepore, a spokesman for the hurricane center.
"You wouldn't want a storm named after Idi Amin," he said.

 BODY:

Producer Prices Up 0.3%; Stocks and Bonds Rally
Producer prices rose three-tenths of 1 percent in September, the biggest increase in eight months, but economists dismissed the jump as the result of only temporary factors, not growing inflation.
Economists said that the increase mainly reflected short-term surges in the cost of vegetables and other food as well as the effect of seasonal adjustment, but many products posted declines. "Inflation fundamentals look as good as they have in 30 years," one economist said. [D2.]
 
The report lifted the stock market as the Dow industrials rose 29.63 points, to 4,764.88, and the Nasdaq index climbed 14.06 points, to 1,015.63. On the bond market, the yield on 30-year Treasuries fell to 6.39 percent, its lowest since Feb. 7, 1994. [D8.]
 
Paine Webber Earnings Nearly Triple
Paine Webber surprised Wall Street by reporting that third-quarter earnings nearly tripled to $782 million, or 71 cents a share, helped by the surging stock markets, lower interest rates and a flood of money flowing into mutual funds. Its stock hit a new high for the year before closing at $21.375, up $1.75, or 9 percent. [D4.]
 
Texas Instruments Profits Jump
Texas Instruments reported that its third-quarter earnings rose 55 percent to $289 million, or $1.48 a share, on soaring demand for computer chips around the world. [D4.]
 
AT&T Names Top Executives
AT&T named one of its top executives to run its core communication company and an outsider to head the equipment business that will be spun off next year. Also, the F.C.C. freed AT&T from the last remnants of rate regulations imposed in 1984. [D2.]
 
Coffee Exchange Stays in New York
The Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange has decided to cancel its plans to move to Jersey City and will instead build a new trading center in Manhattan. [B1.]
 
J. P. Morgan Earnings Up 10%
J. P. Morgan said its third-quarter net income rose 10 percent to $360 million, or $1.78 a share, its best results since 1993. [D4.]
 
Petrie Retail Files for Bankruptcy
Petrie Retail sought protection from its creditors in a bankruptcy filing, and said it has obtained a $115 million credit line from Chemical Bank. [D4.]
 
Sybase Net Income Plunges 95%
Sybase's third-quarter earnings fell 95 percent to $1.14 million, or 2 cents a share. Revenue rose 7 percent to $233.1 million. [D4.]
 
Xerox Introduces Digital Copiers
Xerox introduced the first of a line of digital copier-printers that are designed to be connected to office computer networks. The two new machines differ from traditional copiers because they can receive documents directly from desktop computers, store them in memory and print them as ordered. [D8.]
 
Turner Offers to Take Pay Cut
In a speech, Ted Turner defended the tens of millions of dollars that are to be paid to Michael R. Milken, an adviser on the proposed $7.4 billion takeover of Turner Broadcasting by Time Warner, and offered to cut his own pay package, which is reportedly more than $100 million. [D5.]
 
Britain to Monitor Salomon Unit
British regulators plan to monitor the invest ment business of Salomon Brothers Interna tional for a year. The firm, an arm of Salomon Inc., lost $126 million last year. [D15.].

HEADLINE: Unimpressed by '96 Flock, Some Voters Are in No Hurry

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE 

DATELINE: EASTON, Pa., Oct. 8

 BODY:
Tom and Evelyn Dinan stood in a drizzle outside this city's Center Square the other day trading names of prospective Presidents. But like many other voters here, they were more certain of whom they did not want in the White House than whom they wanted.
"Certainly not Dole," said Mrs. Dinan, who, like her husband, is a Democrat who sometimes backs Republicans. She thrust both hands out as if she were trying to stop Senator Bob Dole, who leads in the polls for the Republican nomination. "I just can't stand Dole." 
 Yet the Dinans looked just as pained at the mention of President Clinton. Mr. Dinan, a 73-year-old retired construction worker, suggested a third-party candidate, as long as it was not Ross Perot or Gen. Colin L. Powell.
Finally, he came up with a name: "I'll vote for Harry Truman. Where's Harry Truman?" The 75-year-old Mrs. Dinan concurred, saying, "That's what we need."
The Republican Presidential competition is in full tilt in Iowa and New Hampshire. Mr. Clinton has amassed millions for his re-election drive. Mr. Perot is hurriedly putting together a third party as he mulls over running himself. And General Powell, the former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, is basking in the will-he-or-won't-he speculation.
But in this once-thriving industrial city of 27,000 in the Lehigh Valley of eastern Pennsylvania, now best known as the home of the former heavyweight boxing champion Larry Holmes, voters are only beginning to sort through their choices for President.
In dozens of random interviews, Easton residents did not sound particularly thrilled with their options. Not one voter said he or she had decided to back one of the major Republican candidates; in fact, most said they were not sure who was in the race and who was out. And even those who have closely followed the parade of candidates and would-be candidates insisted that they had not settled on a favorite and were in no rush to do so.
Nestled among hills and ridges at the confluence of the Delaware and Lehigh Rivers, this city was heavily Democratic in its industrial glory days, when the steel mills were dominant and the city's factories were in full force, cranking out Crayola crayons and Dixie cups. As Easton has struggled to diversify its economy by attracting new businesses, its partisan makeup has also grown more mixed. Voters in the 15th Congressional District, which extends beyond Easton to the larger cities of Allentown and Bethlehem, backed George Bush for President in 1988, then Bill Clinton four years later.
Nowadays, many voters here say they are not wedded to one party or another. And they hardly seem wedded to any candidate.
Lee Clewell, 38, who works in the Crayola factory, said that he usually voted Republican but that none of the contenders struck him particularly favorably. Asked about Mr. Dole, he said he would vote for him only as a last resort.
"When you mention that name," Mr. Clewell said, "it sends chills up my spine." But he could not cite any specific concerns about Mr. Dole, saying "just the way he presents himself -- that turns me off."
Mr. Clewell said that Speaker Newt Gingrich, who is not running but has not completely closed the door on a bid, "is pretty much all Republicans have going for them right now."
But several other voters, including some Republicans, registered doubts about Mr. Gingrich, particularly over whether he was Presidential timber.
Adolf Klova, a 63-year-old semi retired advertising executive, said he was pleased to see Republicans controlling Congress, explaining that Mr. Gingrich "lends balance where there never has been any before."
That said, Mr. Klova does not want the Speaker to run for President. "He's a little quirky in some cases," the executive said. "I could never see him as President, he's too erratic."
But then Mr. Klova put down the Republican contenders one by one, saying, "We need someone with new thoughts and new ideas."
As for another noncandidate, General Powell, voters here were not as infatuated with him as might have been expected given that thousands of Americans have been lining up to buy copies of his memoirs.
While die-hard backers said they would vote for General Powell no matter whether he ran as an independent or a Republican, others vowed never to support him..
Virginia Taylor, a 33-year-old housewife who backed President Bush in 1992, said she hoped that General Powell, who is retired, ran as a Republican. She said she would favor him by far over the current field.
"He gives heroism back to America," Mrs. Taylor said. "He's done a job and proven he can do a job." If General Powell runs as in independent next year, she said she would still vote for him.
Mrs. Taylor offered a "dream ticket": Powell-Perot. "Powell's stability would help to balance Perot," she said.
Such a ticket was also suggested by a handful of other Easton residents, including Julio Rivera, 23, who voted for Mr. Clinton in 1992.
"Colin Powell can be the President and Ross Perot can be the Vice President," said Mr. Rivera, a nursing home aide. "Ross Perot can give him ideas about the economy. And Powell knows the ins and outs of Washington, D.C. But I don't know if he'll ever get elected being the first black guy."
Several white voters said they hoped General Powell would run to help smooth racial divisions -- rubbed particularly raw in the aftermath of O.J. Simpson's acquittal on murder charges. "I'd love to see the guy get in," said Al Manazer, 62, who runs the Easton Bus Terminal. "He's been a military man. A career man. He might be able to do something with this racist thing."
But a block away, Larry Kinchen, a 42-year-old black foundry worker, said he would stick with Mr. Clinton even though he thought the President had let down the poor and elderly.
"Why vote for Colin Powell?" Mr. Kinchen asked. "He doesn't have the experience whatsoever."
Gerald Stern, 70, a poet, also prefers Mr. Clinton, but for different reasons. "What is it with America that we're in love with a military person?" he asked. "Is what's attractive about him that he's an enigma? Are we going to vote for another puzzle?"
Mr. Stern said it was only with great reluctance that he expected to vote again for Mr. Clinton. "What troubles me about Clinton is what makes him successful," he said. "An extraordinary politician is one who can change his position in an instant and pretend he's always had it."
The media saturation about General Powell has apparently not touched everyone here. The name drew several blank stares.
"Don't know of him," said Samuel Nutall, 25, a crane operator. Explaining that he voted for Ross Perot in 1992, and wants to do so again next year, Mr. Nutall said: "He made himself a billionaire. And I like the way he speaks."
But mostly, the mention of Mr. Perot was greeted with snickers. "He wants attention, a little bit of love," Mr. Stern said.
Jim Vones, 76, a landlord who voted for Mr. Perot in 1992, said he was not eager to do so again. "Perot knows how to make money," Mr. Vones said. "But what good does that do you? When you get in there, you make more money."
Having soured on the candidates now running, Mr. Vones also put in a plug for an old favorite.
"You know what you need?" he asked. "You need a farmer with some good common sense. A guy like Harry Truman."

Latest Data On Economy Lift Bonds

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities rose yesterday, as some investors decided that the latest economic reports meant the door was still open to another interest-rate cut by the Federal Reserve this year.
The 30-year bond rumbled ahead for a gain of 19/32, to a price of 106 15/32; its yield, which moves in the opposite direction of its price, fell to 6.39 percent, from 6.43 percent on Wednesday, the lowest since Feb. 7, 1994. 
 The Labor Department's Producer Price Index and weekly initial unemployment claims for the period ended Oct. 7 did little to change market expectations of moderate growth and inflation, since both were within economists' forecasts. And this means there is still a chance that the Fed will make another rate cut to give the economy a little lift.
Larry Berman, senior fixed-income analyst at Technical Data in Boston, said that "the market is now poised to break into new ground." He predicted that today's economic releases, led by the Consumer Price Index, would provide "additional stimulus for the markets and traders will be buying any perceived weakness" in anticipation of a cut in short-term interest rates by the Federal Reserve at the meeting next month of its policy-setting arm, the Federal Open Market Committee.
Anthony E. Spare, chief investment officer at Spare, Kaplan, Bischel & Associates, a $2 billion money management firm in San Francisco, said he was not betting on another interest-rate cut. "There is not really any strong reason for them to do anything," he said.
Mr. Spare believes the current cash-market yields are likely to establish the lower end of the trading range for the next six to nine months, rather than the middle or higher end.
In the day's trading, prices got some support from the producer prices report, which showed prices rising three-tenths of 1 percent in September. But as the dollar sagged against the major world currencies, bonds followed.
Bonds rebounded after the Atlanta Fed said that its national production index tumbled to a minus 6.5 versus a plus 3.3 in August. Economists said that the report by the regional Fed was yet another piece of data added to a growing mound of evidence that suggests the economy is slowing.
The cash market was fueled by the strong finish in debt futures, where the December bond hit a new contract high of 116 5/32. "The continuous contract high is 122 10/32," said Robin Mesch, fixed-income analyst with Thomson Research in Boston, referring to the continuing high price of a bond future regardless of its expiration date.
That, she said, "leaves more room to the upside," adding, "However, a move under 115 7/32 in the next five days would suggest to me that the rally was a failure."
The December bond contract also hit a settlement high of 116 2/32.
Traders attributed the late surge in bond prices to short-covering by those investors who had been betting against further market strength. "There is only one conclusion you can make about today's break to the upside over new contract highs," Ms. Mesch said -- prices will go higher.
"Our original quarterly targets are 116 21/32 to 116 27/32," she said. "But it's best not to try to anticipate where a rally will end. Rather, people should monitor support levels to hold onto their bonds, rather than think about what resistance levels will break down. As long as support holds, the rally will remain intact."
At yesterday's $18.25 billion auction of new one-year Treasury bills, the average rate increased to 5.30 percent, from 5.21 percent last month, the highest rate in two months. That was a sign not all traders expect the Fed to cut rates at its next policy meeting on Nov. 15. Had more traders bought the bill, the price would have gone higher and its rate would have come in lower.
The following are the results of yesterday's Treasury auction of new 52-week bills:

HEADLINE: 6 Companies Lose Control At Market

BYLINE: By SELWYN RAAB 

 BODY:
In its boldest move yet to break the Mafia's grip on the Fulton Fish Market, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's administration has decided to remove six companies that have long controlled the flow of fish into the market, officials said yesterday. It plans to replace them with a new company that has no experience in the seafood-distribution business.
The new system, which will begin Sunday, affects companies, known as unloaders, that collect $2 million in fees annually for unloading seafood supplies, the officials said. 
 Speaking on the condition of anonymity, the officials and city investigators said that reinforced police contingents would be assigned to the market in lower Manhattan to head off any work disruptions because of the changeovers and dismissals of employees who work for the six unloading companies.
A major revision in the unloading system will require for the first time that the new company unload and deliver seafood from refrigerated trucks on a first-come, first-served basis to 60 wholesale dealers in the market. More than 100 trucking companies deliver 150 million pounds of fish and seafood each year from Atlantic and Gulf Coast ports and from airports.
Under the old unloading system, each of the six companies had specific territorial rights, and decided among themselves the order in which trucks were unloaded and how quickly. Because seafood is perishable, the unloaders had economic strangleholds over truckers and wholesalers, the officials said. City officials and Federal investigators said that in the past, the truckers and merchants had no choice in selecting an unloading company, and were forced to pay the prices the unloaders dictated.
City officials said they expected that the new system would lower prices for merchants by about 20 percent. The wholesalers generally pay most of the unloading charges. In the past, officials said, unloaders also charged illegal fees to truckers who wanted their fish unloaded more quickly. The officials said such supplemental fees would now be banned.
The concern chosen by the city to take over the exclusive unloading duties is Laro Maintenance Company of Bay Shore, L.I. The company, according to business records, has specialized in cleaning and maintenance services for office buildings in the New York area.
Aides to Mayor Giuliani said the Laro company had passed a background check by the city's Department of Investigation.
Rudy Washington, the city's Commissioner of Business Services, will inform the six ousted firms and the wholesalers in the market today of the new setup.
The Laro company will be licensed for two years, officials said. It will not be required to hire any of the 40-odd employees now working for the six expelled unloading companies.
Without city licenses, and acting on their own authority, the six firms had for decades been in charge of unloading seafood when they arrived at the market in refrigerated trucks and transporting them short distances to the wholesale dealers. The dealers then sold the produce to retail merchants and restaurateurs.
In 1987, when Mayor Giuliani was Federal Attorney in Manhattan, his office cited the principal owners of the six unloading companies in a civil racketeering case as associates in the Genovese crime family.
The owners have denied links to organized crime and no criminal charges were brought against them.
Ousting the unloading companies is the most significant move by the administration since a licensing law went into effect on Sept. 1, empowering the city to determine who can do business and who can work in the market. The law is intended to end corruption in business practices and to rid the market of organized crime.
In its 160 years of existence, the market has inspired colorful tales of gritty merchants and laborers who toil from midnight to dawn on the banks of the East River to supply the New York area with fresh seafood. But Federal and state investigations have produced another story of a rough, insular landscape in which mobsters thrive on extortions, no-show jobs and illegal gambling and loan-sharking rackets.
For the last 60 years, law enforcement officials have said the Genovese crime family and to a lesser extent the Bonanno family control many wholesale dealers and companies in the market through their influence in groups like the unloaders.
The companies that are to be removed are: P.A.S. & G. Unloading Company; Seaport Unloaders; Dead Fish Relocators (formerly Fish Unloaders); J. Fox Unloading; R. Fox Unloading, and Jet Unloading.

HEADLINE: New York Makes Staying Put Irresistible to Coffee Exchange

BYLINE: By BRETT PULLEY 

 BODY:
Offering one of the most lucrative packages of subsidies ever provided in New York City, state and city officials persuaded the board of the Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange yesterday to cancel plans to move the exchange to Jersey City, and instead to build a new trading center in Manhattan.
Officials described the exchange's decision as a critical victory in the economic development war with New Jersey, which had offered a valuable set of incentives to lure both the Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange and the Cotton Exchange across the Hudson River. 
 Together, the two exchanges directly employ about 3,500 people, but city and state officials estimated that a total of 5,000 jobs would be lost if both moved to Jersey City.
The Cotton Exchange's 30-member board had voted earlier this week to move its operation to Jersey City. But after its sister trading group's announcement, the Cotton Exchange issued a terse statement that it would reconsider its decision next week. Relocation plans for the two have been linked, and are expected to stay that way.
New York officials were hopeful that the Cotton Exchange's board would reverse itself.
"We're elated that the Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange voted to stay in New York," said Charles A. Gargano, chairman of the state's Empire State Development Corporation. "But our proposal is for both of them to act in unison. The bottom line is to keep 5,000 jobs here in New York."
To keep the exchanges in New York, the city and state offered $91 million in subsidies, which places the deal among the largest the city has offered to keep a business. Only one other recent retention deal has compared. In August 1994, the New York Mercantile Exchange threatened to move to Jersey City and was granted $184 million in subsidies to build a facility in Battery Park City. That building is under construction.
With the new offer, the city and state have offered a total of $275 million over the past year to keep the futures industry based in Manhattan. According to the New York City Economic Development Corporation, the largest retention package in the city's history was for $235 million, to Chase Manhattan Corporation in 1988. Measured against the number of employees involved, 4,600, the Chase deal cost the city $51,000 per employee.
By comparison, the city's offer to the Coffee and Cotton exchanges cost about $26,000 for each of the 3,500 employees. The deal with the Mercantile Exchange cost $22,700 for each of the 8,100 employees. But to Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, the benefits outweigh the costs. "It's important for New York City, within the balance of the things that we can negotiate, to retain these exchanges," he said at a news conference. "It helps to secure our position as the financial capital of the world, and particularly if they're going to also build a new exchange. That really solidifies they're remaining here."
In July, the Cotton and Coffee exchanges signed a tentative agreement with New Jersey to build a $118 million trading floor at the site of the former Colgate Center. Under that pact, the exchanges had until yesterday to confirm their plans with New Jersey officials.
"We know that the Cotton Exchange has voted to accept a proposal from New Jersey," Brian Kelly, the Coffee Exchange's chairman, said in a prepared statement, "but additional benefits were made available from New York subsequent to that vote which significantly impacted the C.S.C.E. decision.
"We are hopeful that the Cotton Exchange will agree with us on the quality of the New York deal and join us so we may finally move forward to develop the trading facility we so desperately need for the members of both of our exchanges."
Under the terms of New York's offer, the exchanges, which together represent about 17 percent of the commodity trading volume in New York City, will build the trading center in the TriBeCa section of lower Manhattan, on a site bordered by Murray, Warren, Greenwich and West Streets.
Specific details for the building are still unclear, but a Coffee Exchange spokeswoman said the new TriBeCa operation would be "fundamentally the same" as the one planned for Jersey City. That facility was designed to provide 275,000 square feet of space, and a 25,000 square-foot trading floor.
The decision marked a bitter setback for New Jersey, which had hoped that its own package of subsidies as well as the lower costs of doing business would persuade the exchanges to abandon Manhattan. Although several New York-based firms have opened large back-office operations in Jersey City, the exchanges would have been the first major front offices based there.
"Obviously we're disappointed," said Thomas Gallagher, press secretary for Mayor Bret Schundler of Jersey City. The presence of the exchanges, he said, "could have a massive impact not just from the influx of jobs, but also the prestige factor."
Jersey City and state officials refused to disclose the value of their incentive package, which included cash, financing for infrastructure, and tax and utility abatements. People familiar with the negotiations say that the dollar amount was several million less than the amount New York offered. However, when the difference in cost structures in the two states is taken into account, according to these sources, New York's offer was only slightly better than New Jersey's.
"The large incentive package that New York had to offer to keep the exchanges shows the competitive strength of the Jersey City waterfront," Mr. Gallagher said.
The commodities exchanges have threatened to accept subsidized relocation offers from New Jersey on at least three occasions over the last several years, but each time the city and state have countered with retention packages that include new trading facilities. Even so, the Mercantile development is the first one of those that has actually gone forward with construction.
In lower Manhattan, retaining the exchanges bolsters prospects for recovery from the losses and personnel cutbacks that have hit the financial services industry recently.
In addition to the jobs that would be lost to a relocation, an exodus of futures exchanges would decentralize commodities trading activity in the New York area, which according to the Futures Industry Association accounts for about 20 percent of futures trading in the nation.
Chicago, home of the Chicago Board of Trade and Chicago Mercantile Exchange, dominates the U.S. commodities market, with more than 75 percent of domestic futures trading volume.
Futures exchanges are marketplaces in which contracts for the future delivery of commodities such as coffee and cotton are traded according to pre-established conditions. The contract itself is a transferable agreement to deliver or receive the commodity at a specified time and at a specified price.
By retaining the Coffee Exchange, New York also maintains an important position in an industry that is growing worldwide. Although the Coffee Exchange only accounts for 2.3 percent of the commodities trading volume in the United States, the total worldwide volume of futures trading has more than doubled over the last 25 years. "It's gone up, up, up," said John Damgard, president of the Futures Industry Association, a Washington-based trade group.
This rapid growth has left New York's commodities markets physically squeezed inside their current home at the World Trade Center, where they share a crowded trading floor that is both inefficient and outdated. Competition from new foreign exchanges with modern operations is forcing improvements on domestic exchanges. "If those markets can't attract business on an efficient basis," Mr. Damgard said, "then that business is going to go someplace else."
According to the terms of the proposal, New York will give the exchanges a cash grant of $36 million. It will also provide about $55 million in tax and other noncash incentives. In addition, it has offered to help finance the construction of a facility by guaranteeing up to $20 million in loans. Under the terms offered, the cash grant would be provided as long as the Coffee and Cotton exchanges stayed in New York, regardless of the outcome of a proposed merger with the Mercantile Exchange.

HEADLINE: Tax Breaks Approved to Spur Growth in Lower Manhattan

BYLINE: By THOMAS J. LUECK 

 BODY:
The New York State Senate, clearing a political snag that had delayed an ambitious economic development plan for New York City, yesterday approved a tax abatement bill intended to spur office and housing construction in lower Manhattan.
The tax abatements are part of a plan announced by Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani that is meant to help reverse the decline of Wall Street and the rest of the financial district. Office vacancies there are high, many buildings are outdated for the computer age, and its streets are all but deserted at night. The bill that passed the Senate is meant to encourage redevelopment to attract businesses, and, for the first time, spur residential use of the area. 
 Although the Mayor's plan has won wide support -- it has been passed by the Assembly and endorsed by Gov. George E. Pataki -- it was held up in June when the leader of the Senate's Republican majority, Joseph L. Bruno of Rensselaer County, refused to allow it to reach the floor for a vote.
The squabble erupted after the Senate's minority leader, Martin Connor of Brooklyn, refused to deliver Democratic support for a resolution to legalize casino gambling, which was sponsored by Mr. Bruno.
But yesterday, the tax abatement bill cleared the Senate on a 53-to-1 vote, with Senator Franz Leichter, a Democrat of Manhattan who has long criticized tax breaks for business, voting against the measure.
Business people said that Senate passage, coming on a day when Mayor Giuliani won a battle to persuade the Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange to stay in lower Manhattan, was critical to a broad effort to improve the area.
The tax abatements in the bill would benefit developers who renovate buildings below Chambers Street that were built before 1975, or help those who build new ones. The inducements are intended in part to encourage conversion of old buildings into apartments or to modern offices equipped with the wiring necessary for computers.
Some abatements would flow directly to office tenants. They include a sharp five-year cut in the city's commercial rent tax, which is assessed at 6 percent of total rent and is almost always paid by tenants.
As an inducement to developers, the abatements would also include a five-year reduction in property taxes, and a 10-year exemption from higher property tax assessments based on the improvements.

HEADLINE: Cash Needed For Investing, Chrysler Says

BYLINE: By JAMES BENNET 

DATELINE: DETROIT, Oct. 12

 BODY:
To rally support against Kirk Kerkorian, the Chrysler Corporation has prepared a detailed defense for stockholders that illustrates how the company has broadened its justification for a $7.5 billion cash reserve, judging by a draft report of the presentation.
In the past, Chrysler executives stressed that the cash fund was intended to cushion the company in the next economic downturn. But as Mr. Kerkorian has attacked the target as excessive, urging Chrysler to return more money to stockholders, the company has begun to speak of the cash cushion as though it were also a vast checking account, enabling it to pursue unexpected opportunities. 
 The company plans to take that approach when it meets with institutional investors this month, judging by the draft report. As one might expect, the draft also shows that Chrysler intends to defend vigorously the quality of its cars and trucks, the return on its stock and its long-term plans.
Chrysler confirmed that the document, which was provided to The New York Times by a person who insisted on anonymity, was an early draft of its presentation. "Financial Flexibility/Cash Target" is the title of the page in the draft presentation that outlines the cash goal. "Cash reserves are necessary to provide flexibility for new investment opportunities, as well as to provide reserves for a downturn," the text reads, in part. Chrysler said it planned to make the same point in the final presentation.
In May, in an address to shareholders at the company's annual meeting, Robert J. Eaton, Chrysler's chairman and chief executive, did not mention investment opportunities as a rationale for the cash reserve. "Considering what a downturn can do to an auto company's cash flow, that cushion is altogether reasonable," he said of the $7.5 billion.
Chrysler currently has $6.4 billion in its reserve fund.
Steven Harris, a Chrysler spokesman, acknowledged that Chrysler had recently begun to emphasize that its cash reserve could finance unexpected investments. He said Chrysler had always had that motive for storing up cash, but did not communicate it before. With so much public discussion of the reserve, he said, "we just felt we need to explain it as fully as we can."
But George Sard, a spokesman for the Tracinda Corporation, Mr. Kerkorian's wholly owned company, said, "This is a backhand acknowledgement by Chrysler that they really don't need $7.5 billion in cash to ride out the next recession." Mr. Kerkorian is Chrysler's largest shareholder, with a stake of more than 14 percent.
According to the draft, Chrysler intends to argue that its cash target is in line with those established by its competitors. Its target is 15 percent of automotive revenue, compared with 11 percent at the General Motors Corporation, 16 percent at the Ford Motor Company, and 33 percent at the Toyota Motor Corporation, according to the document.
Mr. Harris said that the presentation had changed in subsequent drafts. "It's definitely not the final," he said of the draft copy. Although the draft says the presentations are scheduled to run from Oct. 18 to Oct. 20, Mr. Harris said no final dates had been set.
After Mr. Kerkorian hired Jerome B. York, a former Chrysler chief financial officer, on Sept. 5, Chrysler appeared to go on the defensive as Mr. York criticized its financial management and the quality of its vehicles. But Chrysler has recently appeared to regain its footing. The draft presentation echoes a speech Mr. Eaton delivered to institutional investors in New York last week in which he strongly defended his management of the nation's No. 3 auto maker.
In the document, Chrysler proudly points to its rich mix of sales, with highly profitable light trucks increasingly outselling its cars. The document also underlines Chrysler's plans for international growth, to 500,000 sales by 1999, from 229,000 this year.
But the draft presentation does not knock down all of Mr. York's criticisms, and it selectively addresses others.
For example, the draft says that problems covered by warranties had dropped 26 percent since 1992. It does not mention that warranty costs per car have risen somewhat.
And while it correctly notes the performance of Chrysler's light trucks in the J. D. Power & Associates Initial Quality Survey, it does not mention that Chrysler cars, as a group, lag behind many competitors in the survey. Mr. Harris pointed out, as does the draft report, that five of the nine most-improved car models in the Power study were Chrysler products, including the two most improved.
In the draft report, Tracinda is mentioned only in the penultimate item on the summary page. "Tracinda is a distraction -- not acting in best interest of all shareholders," reads the item.
It is followed by one last, even briefer note: "Need your support."

HEADLINE: Follow the Leader

BYLINE: By ALLEN R. MYERSON 

 BODY:
In September 1993, Arnold P. Cohen arrived in Eldersburg, Md., as chief executive of the London Fog Corporation, the raincoat maker. He soon announced that he was closing the company's five plants there, moving production overseas and the headquarters to Darien, Conn.
"The reality is that the fashion industry is located in Manhattan and we wanted to move closer," Mr. Cohen told reporters. 
 The reality is also that Darien is even closer to Westport, Conn. -- about a 20-minute drive -- than to New York's Fashion Avenue. And Mr. Cohen had a home in Westport.
In August 1994, with the company dizzy and near financial collapse, Mr. Cohen, who said his predecessors had decided to move to the New York area, exited. In January of this year, only two months after the migration was completed, a new chief offered a new idea, since adopted: head back to Eldersburg.
An isolated case? Hardly. London Fog's move was just one of many corporate relocations in which a declaration of high corporate purpose happens to coincide with making the boss's life more convenient.
Earlier this year, Albert J. Dunlap, an avid golf and tennis player, announced plans to move the Scott Paper Company from Philadelphia to Boca Raton, Fla. The announcement came just days after he bought a $1.8 million home there. Over dinner before the move, he had told a local member of Congress that it could be his first home or his second. Mr. Dunlap confirmed recently that his wife was not so coy. According to an account that he did not dispute, she had said, "I don't know about you, Al, but it's going to be my first home."
Just last month, Tenneco Inc. announced a move from Houston to Greenwich, Conn. Dana G. Mead, the chief executive, said he wanted to shuck his company's oil-patch image. Yes, he lived in Greenwich for four years until he joined Tenneco in 1992, he said, but wanting to go back there played no role in the decision.
Mr. Mead might study the example of Armco Inc. , the steelmaker. The company, wanting to diversify and distance itself from its smokestacks, moved in 1985 from Middletown, an Ohio steel town, to Parsippany, N.J. Eight years later, after continuing losses, the company moved back to steel country, to Pittsburgh, under a new chief, a Pittsburgh native.
Executives seldom need prompting to provide business rationale for relocations. But many bosses seem most alert to the rationale for moving to Connecticut's executive havens or, increasingly, to southern Florida's beachfront resort areas, where the golf season never ends. Larry Pelton, a business recruiter in Palm Beach County, which includes Boca Raton, boasts that he is in relocation talks with four Fortune 500 companies whose top executives all have local homes.
Although statistics are few, relocation specialists and attentive investors say corporations are becoming more mobile, with executive fancy figuring ever larger in their moves. "It seems to be escalating," said Anne S. Hansen, deputy director of the Council of Institutional Investors, representing pension funds with $800 billion in assets. "It's our money, and it's being used to pay for moving expenses we are not really convinced are necessary."
Having fought to limit executive pay, shareholders are starting to watch out for bosses who turn a headquarters move into another perk. "It's just a sneakier way of getting more compensation," Ms. Hansen said. "Now that people are attuned to these sky-high compensation agreements, you're getting paid in different ways. One of the current ways to escape scrutiny for higher compensation is to move the company to your favorite place to live."
The ability to manage by telephone, fax and computer has made it easier for a core of executives to plop down in a verdant suburb or resort, leaving everyone else behind. Mr. Mead's new headquarters, for just 100 employees, will have the latest in video-conferencing gear, allowing the Greenwich bosses to glare at division managers in places like Evanston, Ill.; Newport News, Va., and Houston.
Companies moving only their top management put the cost at a few million dollars to $25 million, depending on how many go, whether the new headquarters are bought or leased and what the company considers as a relocation expense. But that does not include the human costs of dislocation or layoffs for underlings.
As much as 90's-style chief executives talk about re-engineering, right-sizing and maximizing shareholder value, real estate agents sense a different message. "That's always been the big joke in the real estate business," said Randy Strait, a senior vice president with the Transwestern Property Company in Houston. "You try to find out where the chairman lives and show him a building nearby."
This inspiration helps Palm Beach County convince many an executive that the business climate is as balmy as the beaches. Besides Scott Paper, in the last few years the county has snared W. R. Grace & Company and the Thompson Medical Company from New York, and several more concerns, including the Wackenhut Corporation, from the Miami area.
Two years ago, county planners quietly began approaching virtually any executive with a local home valued at $1 million or more. "They don't have to live in the Northeast nine months of the year and visit here three months," said Mr. Pelton, with the Business Development Board of Palm Beach County. "They can reverse that, and just visit the Northeast for three months." Instead of blowing its budget on a national publicity campaign, the development board has found it can reach all the right people just by advertising in The Palm Beach Post over the winter.
W. R. Grace became the first big corporation to hit the local beaches when it moved to Boca Raton from New York in 1991. Chuck Suits, a spokesman, says the company's chairman at the time, the late J. Peter Grace Jr., and J. P. Bolduc, then the president, were absolutely not influenced by having vacation homes nearby. "The decision to relocate was part of an extensive three-year study of 100 cities on the Eastern Seaboard," he said.
It was Mr. Bolduc, Mr. Dunlap said, who helped lure him and Scott Paper. Mr. Dunlap had bought a home and moved to Boca Raton, wanting to retire there. In April 1994, Scott Paper hired and brought him to Philadelphia, buying his Boca Raton home for $3.3 million.
But Philadelphia proved too chilly for Mr. Dunlap. In a December speech at the Union League Club, he derided the wintry climate and the city's failure to appreciate his rescue of Scott Paper and the huge payoff for shareholders. Instead, he said, reporters vilified him, presenting the plaints of workers caught in vast layoffs.
Other cities, he said, named buildings for him, held parades for him. "Of course," said John Claypool, executive director of Greater Philadelphia First, a business development group, "those were situations where he had moved companies to town.'
Having slashed the size of the office staff, Mr. Dunlap next wanted to dispose of Scott's tranquil 55-acre headquarters in Philadelphia. "We had a pond, we had geese, we had walking trails," Mr. Dunlap said recently. "It was idyllic, except nothing much happened there."
Development officials of Boca Raton took full advantage of Mr. Dunlap's discontent, offering $780,000 in local and state subsidies. Local bankers, developers, medical leaders and politicians trooped up to see him. In March, Mr. Dunlap closed on a $1.8 million mansion at the Boca Raton Hotel and Resort. A week later, he announced that he was moving the company, too.
"My decision to move down here was done solely on economics," Mr. Dunlap said. And any demands from his wife? "She had zero influence."
Then, four months later, Mr. Dunlap agreed to sell the company to the Kimberly-Clark Corporation for $7 billion. The merged company will keep enough jobs in Boca Raton to justify the incentives, he said.
Tenneco, however, has decided to go for the geese, reversing the usual, southward course of the corporate flock.
As an executive of the International Paper Company, Mr. Mead had a major role in moving the company from Manhattan to Purchase, N.Y., in 1987. He lived across the Connecticut border in the Cos Cob neighborhood of Greenwich until Tenneco recruited him as president in 1992.
When he became chief executive of Tenneco early last year, he followed through on his predecessor's search for a new corporate home. He announced the move to Connecticut, costing as much as $25 million, last month. The destination is an estate once owned by Henry R. Luce, the co-founder of Time magazine. There, a flock of Canada geese will find a new protector.
Mr. Mead, a Midwesterner, said Tenneco was becoming less of an energy company than a maker of auto parts, packaging and other goods, and thus needed to be near New York deal makers. "This is a business decision," he said. "We clearly picked a place where we'd like to live. But when you get down to it it's one word: New York."
Or maybe two or three words, among them "Greenwich." Greenwich, Mr. Mead said, is "as close as you can get to New York and still be in Connecticut."
The consultants who help corporate chiefs choose their new quarters can readily serve their own cause, too. As Moran, Stahl & Boyer, the relocation agency, prepared to move out of Manhattan in May, it was pulled in two directions. Charles K. Elliott, the second-in-command, lives in Irvington, N.Y. But the agency's new chief lives in Atlanta.
Trust the consultants to find a solution. Several members of the firm are going to Atlanta and others to Valhalla, N.Y., the home of the agency's parent company, a unit of the Prudential Insurance Company. Valhalla is about 15 minutes from Mr. Elliott's house.
"We didn't think this out strategically," said W. Kurt Foreman, a consultant at Moran, Stahl & Boyer. "We sort of did the Boca thing."


GRAPHIC: Scott Paper's old corporate campus was in cold Philadelphia. But Albert J. Dunlap, the company's chief executive, bought a $1.8 million house in Boca Raton, Fla. A week after he closed on the house in March, Mr. Dunlap announced that the company would be moving, too.

 When Arnold P. Cohen took over London Fog, he moved the company from Eldersburg, Md., to Darien, Conn., close to his home in Westport. After a year of turmoil, London Fog decided to return to Eldersburg. More recently, Dana G. Mead, Teneco's chief executive, said Tenneco would move from Houston to Greenwich, Conn., his home before joining the company.

HEADLINE: Rowland Sets Stage for Casino Battle

BYLINE: By JONATHAN RABINOVITZ 

DATELINE: CROMWELL, Conn., Oct. 12

 BODY:
Faced with an uphill battle to win legislative approval for a casino in Bridgeport, Gov. John G. Rowland today started using the tool that so often wins votes: He began promising people money.
In a speech to the Connecticut Conference of Municipalities, whose members represent the state's 169 cities and towns, Governor Rowland announced that the casino would increase state revenues by $200 million during the next three years. That money, he said, would go directly to cities and towns for property tax relief. 
 Mr. Rowland's plan represents a remarkable shift in his priorities and an apparent bow to pragmatic politics. In his election bid last year, Mr. Rowland, a Republican, said that massive cuts in the income tax would be his first order of business, and that property tax reductions favored by his Democratic opponent were a secondary concern.
Now, 10 months into his term, and still $300 million short of meeting his original goal for an income tax cut, Mr. Rowland has apparently changed his focus to win the legislative support he needs for a casino.
"This morning I would implore all of you to do what's best for your community, for Bridgeport and for the state of Connecticut: join us in this effort," he said, asking the mayors and selectmen to lobby their legislators.
Then, describing Bridgeport as a dying city that cannot even attract a new car dealership, he sounded a plaintive note, "I don't have any other solutions."
Mr. Rowland's plea comes two weeks before a special session of the legislature is to consider the Governor's recommendation to allow the Mashantucket Pequot Indian tribe to open a casino in Bridgeport. The tribe, which operates the Foxwoods Resort Casino in Ledyard, near the Rhode Island border, has proposed spending $875 million for the new waterfront casino complex that would include a hotel, restaurants and a shopping arcade.
It would be the closest casino to New York City -- about a one-hour train trip. And Foxwoods executives have predicted that it would be the most profitable casino in the world.
Still, it has generated opposition in the legislature from an unlikley alliance of two groups. Some lawmakers are opposed to any expansion of casino gambling in the state. Others are opposed to the Pequots, pointing to their refusal to allow slot machines in the jai alai fronton in Milford, the dog track in Plainfield and off-track betting parlors. These lawmakers favor a more expansive gambling proposal by the Las Vegas-based Mirage Resorts, which Mr. Rowland rejected.
For Mr. Rowland, the decision boiled down to economics. The Pequots last year paid the state $135 million from Foxwoods in return for the state granting them and another tribe a monopoly on slot machines. The Indians would cease paying this money if Mirage were allowed to build a casino in Bridgeport.
While Mirage officials claimed that they had submitted a letter of credit that would make up for any loss of revenue the state might suffer, Mr. Rowland today dismissed their offer. "It was not worth the paper it was written on," he remarked, clearly trying to discourage lawmakers who want to revive Mirage's bid.
Mr. Rowland's bid for support seemed to persuade some officials.
H. Richard Borer Jr., the Mayor of West Haven, said he had been "indifferent" about the new casino until this morning's speech. "Right now we receive $1 million," he explained, referring to the money his town receives from the Foxwoods payments. "If we could increase that and lower property taxes, I'm all for it."
Mr. Borer said he planned to call the four lawmakers who represent his town, including three who have been critical of the Pequots' proposal, to urge them to support the Bridgeport project.
Others, however, were skeptical that the towns would ever receive more of the revenue. The state promised two years ago to forward all Indian revenues to the towns, but last year kept 37 percent for its own budget. "It's an enormous pie in the sky," said Arthur S. Rosenblatt, First Selectman of Norfolk.
Still, property tax relief has been a cherished dream for the Connecticut Conference of Muncipalities for years, and the group, an important player in state politics, will decide next week whether to endorse Mr. Rowland's proposal.
Mr. Rowland was cautious today in predicting the outcome of the casino vote, giving it a "50-50" chance for approval. But he made it clear that he would not hold back in his push for the project.
"I've got my prestige on the line," he said.

HEADLINE: Producer Price Index Is Up, But Increase Is Discounted

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 12

 BODY:
The Labor Department reported today that prices paid to American producers rose in September by the biggest amount in eight months, but economists dismissed the jump as the result of only temporary factors and quirks, not accelerated inflation.
The Producer Price Index for finished goods rose three-tenths of 1 percent, but economists said that it mainly reflected short-term surges in the cost of vegetables and other food as well as the effect of seasonal adjustment. 
 "I don't see anything here that's bothersome," Maury N. Harris, chief economist at Paine Webber Inc., said of the report. "I don't think we've got an inflation problem."
Indeed, goods at the intermediate stage of production, like bolts of cloth, posted their first decline since late 1993 and raw materials other than food and energy fell 2.1 percent.
"Inflation fundamentals look as good as they have in 30 years," Daniel Friel, senior economic analyst at Nationsbank in Charlotte, N.C., said.
Producer prices are the prices that manufacturers and farmers charge for products they sell to retailers, distributors or other buyers.
A spot-check of corporate executives confirmed that the ability to raise prices had largely vanished in many industries and seemed unlikely to return anytime soon.
"We're having a very difficult time" passing along even small cost increases, said Carroll D. Curless, vice president and controller of Eagle-Picher Industries, a Cincinnati producer of industrial products. He said pressure to hold down prices was the most intense in at least two decades, especially in the automotive industry, where about 60 percent of Eagle-Picher's output is focused.
In a separate report, the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta found that business activity in the Southeast ebbed a bit last month, while the number of companies getting lower prices expanded to balance those getting higher prices. The proportion of companies paying higher prices, though still a majority, shrank.
A second set of Labor Department figures today showed that first-time claims for unemployment benefits rose by 6,000, to 348,000, in the week ended Saturday, the second straight increase following a large decline for the week ended Sept. 23.
The rise in producer prices, which was the first for finished goods since May, brought the annual pace for the third quarter to nine-tenths of 1 percent, the same as in the April-June period. But excluding the erratic food and energy components, prices eased to a 2 percent pace in the July-September quarter compared with a 2.9 percent pace during each of the first two quarters of 1995.
The advance in core producer prices for September alone was two-tenths of 1 percent, the same as the average for the preceding six months. Without seasonal adjustment, core prices actually fell five-tenths of 1 percent.
Food prices climbed 1 percent last month as fresh and dry vegetables soared nearly 40 percent after dropping 13 percent in August. Prices of shortening and cooking oils and pasta turned up while declines for beef and veal slowed sharply.
Energy prices eased five-tenths of 1 percent, partly reflecting a fourth consecutive drop, 2 percent, in the price of gasoline. Prices of passenger cars rose five-tenths of 1 percent but fell 3.1 percent without applying the seasonal adjustment factor.
"The P.P.I. report is yet another sign that inflation remains under control," Merrill Lynch told clients. "We do not expect any cyclical pickup in inflation during the next 12 months and there is a possibility of some further price deceleration."

HEADLINE: The Vietnamese in Germany: No Jobs, No Country

BYLINE: By ALAN COWELL 

DATELINE: BERLIN, Oct. 10

 BODY:
If there is a German version of the American dream, it begins and ends for some in Block F of a housing project at 6 Gehrenseestrasse, in what was once East Berlin.
Here, framed by the concrete symmetry of Communist-era architecture, hundreds of Vietnamese trade gossip, buy newspapers in their own language, pay high rents for mediocre housing and scout for jobs. But they also keep one eye out for the police and wait for the answer to a question that hangs over them all: Will they be among the 40,000 Vietnamese that Germany plans to deport to Vietnam over the next five years? 
 This plan for systematic expulsion of contract workers hired by the Communist Government in the former East Germany, who were never given permanent residency status, and of other Vietnamese who have immigrated illegally, was devised this year. It has been smoothed by a $140 million German aid package for Vietnam -- what some Germans are calling "head money."
It is a tangled tale of many strands and few heroes -- of cold war divisions that have worked to the advantage of organized crime.
But, most of all, the deportation, which could become the biggest of its kind in postwar Germany, exposes the central paradox of the country's attitude toward foreigners. To prevent a revival of xenophobic neo-Nazi violence, officials insist, unwanted and undocumented foreigners should be kept out of Germany. But that, in turn, means that the agenda of the far right -- summed up in its slogan, "Foreigners go home" -- is being fulfilled by a Government that says it seeks social peace and justice.
Interior Minister Manfred Kanther, a man of both tough words and strong action, says that such a policy is "the only guarantee against the abuses of uncontrollable movements of immigrants in the future and against popular discontent turning to radical political forces."
That is not how it seems in the hostels and apartment houses here that are so densely and exclusively filled with Vietnamese that some Germans call them ghettos.
"The people are afraid," said Son Vu Van, who runs a counseling service for Vietnamese at another drab housing project nearby. "They are afraid to talk. They are afraid they will be expelled."
A 33-year-old man who lives in Block F declined to be identified because he feared that publicity would draw the immigration authorities' attention to him. "Who knows who will be expelled, or why?" he said. "All we can do is wait and see. There's nothing for us in Vietnam, so no one wants to go. But it's not good here, either."
His home, he said, is a 150-square-foot room that he shares with one other person in the five-story, government-run workers' hostel where many Vietnamese have found homes. The toilets, kitchens and showers are all communal. The rent is around $370 a month -- about half his earnings from construction work, the man said.
The residents of Block F are among an estimated 100,000 Vietnamese currently in Germany, the product of decades of uneven immigration.
In the 1970's, tens of thousands of South Vietnamese -- the so-called boat people -- found willing asylum in the former West Germany, which introduced a special law to give them permanent residence rights.
After the Communist victory in Vietnam, East Germany imported some 70,000 Vietnamese as contract laborers in the 1980's, just as the West Germans imported hundreds of thousands of Turks as laborers in the 1960's.
Then came the collapse of Communism and German unification.
With too many workers and too few jobs as the newly unified state sought to implant a free-market economy in the east, the Government offered each Vietnamese contract worker a $2,000 payment and a ticket home. As many as 50,000 Vietnamese took the money and left.
But, as Europe's border restrictions began to crumble with the end of Communism, up to 20,000 more Vietnamese workers who had been brought in by other countries of Eastern Europe came here unlawfully, adding to the flow of Poles, Russians, Gypsies and others already being drawn to what Mr. Kanther, the Interior Minister, called "the magnet-like attraction of an economically strong Germany."
The response to the influx of foreigners was a violent neo-Nazi upsurge from 1990 until 1993 that persuaded the German authorities not only to crack down on the far-rightists, but also to strengthen immigration controls.
Germany's longstanding constitutional guarantees of asylum were scrapped. New legislation narrowed guarantees of asylum only to those fleeing persecution who had valid identity documents and who had not traveled through any other country to reach Germany.
A separate set of rules was adopted to cover the anomalous situation of the Vietnamese from the former East Germany. These rules offered limited residence rights for a maximum of two years, but only to those who had jobs, homes and no criminal record.
In one way, the new rules worked. In 1992, 430,000 people sought asylum in Germany. In 1994, the figure was 120,000 and of these, only 12,000 were given residence permits.
Germany's crackdown carries heavy emotional and political cargo: if Germans seem too tough on non-Germans, it inevitably evokes the country's Nazi past. German officials respond by boasting that Germany has a large number of foreigners -- some seven million in a land of 81 million people.
Mr. Kanther said in a recent published interview that Germany spends between $8 billion and $11 billion a year to enforce its immigration laws and to provide social services for people seeking residence.
"That is exemplary," he said. "For me there is not the slightest cause to suggest that German asylum laws are inhumane."
That did not stop him from ordering the expulsion last month of seven Sudanese asylum-seekers after a court dismissed their contention that they faced political persecution at home. They were sent back to Khartoum aboard a chartered Romanian plane despite the protests from the opposition Social Democrats and the German Foreign Ministry. For Mr. Kanther, the point was to prove that Germany is no easy touch for unlawful immigrants.
In the former East Germany, contract workers lived in small rooms and forfeited part of their salary to the Communist authorities in Vietnam. Then, after Communism's fall, Vietnam refused to take back the Vietnamese workers who had not availed themselves of the initial $2,000 offer.
The German authorities, however, were under pressure from German industry to normalize economic ties with Vietnam and thus to secure access to an emerging Southeast Asian market. So last January, Germany and Vietnam agreed to a deal promising aid and export guarantees if Vietnam would take back 40,000 of its own people -- the first 2,500 by the end of this year.
The agreement, which does not affect those who were granted legal asylum, went into effect last month. No one has been expelled yet because the Vietnamese authorities have not approved an initial list of 200 to be deported.
"People are very worried about their stay here," said Hang Trinh Thu, a 25-year-old woman from Hanoi who has been in Germany for six years and who works at a counseling center in Block F.
"Some of them gave up everything in Vietnam to come here. Here, they have jobs, houses, children at school. They will do everything they can to stay in Germany. In their own land, they are strangers."

Daiwa Scandal: As Serious a Question as Barings

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 12

 BODY:
When Barings P.L.C. collapsed last spring after a trader in Singapore lost more than $1.3 billion, some regulators and financial analysts worried out loud about a possible threat to the stability of the international financial system.
There was nothing like the same level of alarm last month when the Daiwa Bank of Japan said that one of its traders in New York had lost $1.1 billion in unauthorized Treasury bond trading and managed to conceal the loss for 11 years. 
 Yet that loss now appears to have highlighted gaps in global financial supervision that are every bit as serious, if not more so. The Daiwa losses have also raised a serious question as to how well the overseers of the world's two largest economies -- the United States and Japan -- are working together to enforce these rules.
After the Barings collapse, some Western regulators privately suggested that bank oversight in Singapore might simply have been inadequate and that similar losses were unlikely in Western industrial countries. Yet the Daiwa losses occurred in an office overseen by the Federal Reserve, one of the best-regarded regulators and a leader in setting standards for the international coordination of banking rules.
The Barings collapse produced considerable relief among regulators that close international cooperation had limited the extent of the damage. Yet Japanese regulators now acknowledge that they had known for six weeks of the mammoth losses at Daiwa's office in the United States, but said nothing to American officials.
When Barings went under, regulators were able to contain the damage quickly, arranging a fast takeover of the venerable Barings and settling its transactions without losses to other financial institutions. Daiwa's losses, while fully absorbed by the parent bank in Tokyo, have only added to the current taint on the international image of Japanese banks at a time when they are already struggling with immense losses on bad loans.
And while regulators had a partial excuse in the sheer speed with which Nicholas W. Leeson, the Barings trader in Singapore, managed to accumulate his losses, the Daiwa losses were built up over 11 years. During that period, the Daiwa Bank's office in New York was repeatedly examined by a succession of Japanese and American regulators.
"The best regulator in the world, the Fed, clearly failed to unveil this problem," said Representative Jim Leach of Iowa, the Republican chairman of the House Banking Committee.
The overall effect of the losses is to underline the extent to which bank regulation still relies on the honesty, good judgment and good sense of bankers. At the same time, the most important cushion against mistakes is the bank's own capital base, which proved adequate in Daiwa's case. Regulators have required banks to increase their capital over the last several decade.
Nonetheless, the losses are a deep embarrassment for the Federal Reserve, which learned of the lack of internal controls at Daiwa three years ago but then failed to notice the losses that this deficiency produced. And the delay in disclosing the losses continues to bedevil the Japanese regulators, who appear, officials here say, to have put their loyalty to fellow nationals ahead of their duties to their international counterparts.
Many regulators and bank industry experts, although not all, say that regulators at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and the New York State Department of Banking should not have been expected to spot the losses at Daiwa sooner. Regulators in the United States review whether a bank has an adequate financial cushion against losses and look at whether it has rules and procedures that will prevent risky activities that could lead to the bank's collapse. But they seldom check specific transactions for fraud, almost always leaving that responsibility to the banks' internal auditors.
Federal Reserve officials may not have done a particularly good job at detecting the fraud, said L. William Seidman, the former chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. "But did they do a miserable job?" he asked. "I don't think so."
In November 1992 and again in November 1993, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York warned Daiwa about the mingling of trading operations with the back office processing of trades, a combination that makes it hard to detect fraud. The bank made some changes but the Fed now contends that those changes did not halt the problem. The Fed has declined to say what, if anything, it did to follow up that order with a review of whether improprieties had already taken place.
Peter Bakstansky, a spokesman for the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, would only say today that "this incident is another wake-up call about the importance of internal controls and the need for constant vigilance on the part of financial institutions to protect their assets."
Still, some banking experts said the Fed should also be held to account. "They should have realized that they had to be aggressive in following up on that," said Bert Ely, a financial consultant in Alexandria, Va. "Every indication is that they had come across a serious control problem."

HEADLINE: FUTURES MARKETS;
Copper Prices Make Big Gains On Reports of Japanese Buying

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
Signs of resurgent Japanese demand drove copper prices up sharply on the Commodity Exchange of New York yesterday, bolstering a fledgling rally in the volatile market.
On other commodity markets, natural gas prices fell for a third consecutive session, and corn and soybeans gave up some of Wednesday's strong gains. The Commodity Research Bureau's index of 21 commodities slipped 0.59 point, to 240.24. 
 Copper for December delivery rose 1.95 cents, to $1.27 a pound.
Analysts cited reports that a large Japanese dealer had purchased rights to copper in warehouses registered with the London Metal Exchange. Demand from Japan, which accounts for 13 percent of world consumption, has been weak this year because of declining automobile and machinery production.
News of the Japanese purchase of the warrants surprised traders. "That was the first sign that demand has kind of turned around," said Stephen Platt of Dean Witter, Discover & Company.
Strength in the United States economy and tight near-term supplies have kept copper trading near six-year highs, but domestic demand slackened in September after prices topped $1.40 a pound. The recent drop below $1.30 has reignited demand, analysts said.
When the December copper contract neared $1.23 in trading on Wednesday, "there was very good trade buying," Bernard Savaiko, an analyst with Paine Webber Inc., said.
Natural gas futures tumbled for a third consecutive day on the New York Mercantile Exchange, reflecting unseasonably warm weather and aggressive stockpiling of gas for winter. November deliveries fell 2.6 cents, to $1.735 for 1,000 cubic feet.
Natural gas producers injected 48 billion cubic feet of gas into underground storage facilities last week despite sharply reduced production from temporary shutdowns of offshore platforms that had been threatened by Hurricane Opal, the American Gas Association, a trade group, reported after the close of trading on Wednesday.
Corn and soybean prices gave back about half of the gains they posted a day earlier on the Chicago Board of Trade.
Soybeans had risen about 10 cents a bushel, and corn gained about 5 cents a bushel on Wednesday after the Agriculture Department lowered its American production estimates to reflect insect damage and an early frost in the Midwest.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Is Weaker Amid Doubts About Central Banks' Intentions

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
The dollar was weaker yesterday as currency traders decided to test the leading central banks' commitment to a stronger dollar.
Concern that central banks would enter foreign exchange markets had kept traders cautious since the weekend. On Saturday, the Group of Seven industrialized nations -- the United States, Japan, Germany, Britain, France, Canada and Italy -- said they would welcome a stronger dollar and vowed to "cooperate closely" in the foreign exchange market. 
 But with little sign of central bank intervention and the dollar higher on Wednesday because of a retreat in the German mark, traders decided to test the price levels of the dollar.
"I don't hear intervention being talked about as much now," said Ian Spence, currency trader for Rabobank Nederland in New York. "As each day goes by with the absence of intervention, if and when it does happen, it will be less effective" in lifting the dollar, he said.
In New York trading late yesterday, the dollar fell to 100.21 yen from 101.07 yen on Wednesday. It also fell to 1.4180 marks from 1.4260 marks. But it edged up to 1.1489 Swiss francs from 1.1485 Swiss francs. The British pound rose to $1.5761 from $1.5718.
Orders from Japanese exporters to sell dollars at 101.20 to 101.30 yen drove the dollar down from its Asian high of 101.25 yen, said David Eddy, chief currency trader at Sumitomo Bank in London.
The dollar fell further against the yen than against the mark yesterday because traders were buying yen for marks. Some of those transactions are executed via the dollar, meaning traders were buying dollars for marks and selling those dollars for yen.
The mark had risen 7 percent against the yen from Sept. 1 through Tuesday, as the German economy has grown steadily while Japan's has stagnated.
"This is just a slight correction" for the mark, as it rose too far, too fast against the yen, said Jay Wertheimer, senior currency trader at Banco di Sicilia in New York.
Many traders expect the dollar to move no more than 3 percent in either direction against the mark and yen over the next three weeks. Solid economic growth in the United States will attract foreign investment, which will give the dollar a boost, they said.
Still, the mark's strength against other European currencies, particularly the French franc, will prevent the dollar from rising much, traders said.

HEADLINE: Shortchanging Inmates on Death Row

 BODY:
In their zeal to limit death penalty appeals, both houses of Congress have approved legislation that is apt to have the perverse effect of dragging out appeals and increasing their cost to the taxpayer. Worse yet, the legislation will increase the chance that innocent defendants, or defendants whose trials were constitutionally flawed, will be executed.
The bills would end $20 million in Federal funding for Post-Conviction Defender Organizations, a network of lawyers in 20 states who handle death row inmates' appeals and advise private attorneys on such cases. Unless the money is restored, death row inmates will spend additional years sitting in prison as states scramble to find lawyers to represent them in Federal court, as required by Federal law. These lawyers are likely to be less experienced, less competent and vastly more expensive than Defender Organization lawyers, who make an average of $30,000 a year. 
 The organizations were founded in the mid-1980's in response to Federal judges' concerns that states were taking years to find lawyers for inmates and that many of the lawyers did not know what they were doing. At minimal cost -- Pennsylvania has five lawyers to work with nearly 200 prisoners -- the organizations keep track of cases and prevent inmates from losing the right to a hearing simply because they had no lawyers or their lawyers missed filing deadlines. Most important, they have kept many innocent or unfairly tried people out of the electric chair.
Good appeals lawyers are important because bad trial lawyers are common. Incompetent or unprepared lawyers crop up so often that Federal judges, largely Reagan and Bush appointees, send back 40 percent of the death sentences they see.
The organizations' success is, of course, the reason death penalty advocates are so exercised. Many states have also ended their portion of Defender Organization funding and several defenders' offices have already closed. The House bill would shut them all immediately. The Senate bill would shut them as of next April 1. Both bills are part of an appropriations measure that President Clinton has threatened to veto for other reasons.
The defenders' program deserves to live. A Congress committed to the death penalty cannot in good conscience deny competent legal counsel. Abolishing the Defender Organizations harms the causes of economy, speed and justice.

HEADLINE: Cloistered Japanese Banks

 BODY:
The recently disclosed trading loss of $1.1 billion at Daiwa Bank will not hasten the collapse of the bank itself. Nor will the losses seriously damage Japan's banking system or economy. But Japan's long delay in informing American regulators of a scandal involving the bank's New York branch has impaired the trust that was developing between the two countries on economic issues. The arrogant and clumsy way the matter was handled in Tokyo also raises doubts about the sincerity of Japan's promised effort to open up its economic system.
In other recent trading debacles, including the $1.3 billion in losses at the Singapore office of Barings P.L.C. of London, bank regulators were among the first to investigate. By contrast, the Finance Ministry in Japan appears to have closed ranks with Daiwa to minimize embarrassment and cover up the damage. 
 With Japan stagnating in its longest postwar recession, it may be understandable that the Government would not want to create a panic about its banking system. The collapse of stock and real estate prices has led to $400 billion in bad loans held by Japanese banks. Many analysts say the loss is twice as big as that. But the Government's impulse has been to let the banks hide the extent of their losses, as if public ignorance would make matters better. A Ministry official offered the remarkable suggestion yesterday that a prompt investigation would have been unseemly in light of the Government's great trust in Japanese banking executives.
American officials make no secret of their disappointment at Japan's action, especially because they have been touting the supposedly extraordinary cooperation they have achieved with their Japanese counterparts on exchange rates and trade matters. But the insular and secretive ways of the Finance Ministry have also drawn criticism in many influential quarters in Japan. A leading Japanese newspaper called the ministry an "anachronistic monster," noting that its bureaucrats havegreater say than elected officials over public works outlays and government spending.
It is up to Japan to determine how best to open up its economy to outside scrutiny. But the United States has a clear interest in Japanese banking reforms. The Daiwa Bank may have violated laws of the United States and New York State. The weakness of Japanese banks has led to higher Japanese interest rates, hampering a recovery that affects the United States as well as Japan.
The United States needs to remind Japanese leaders that the obligation to disclose is a foundation for all international dealings of financial institutions. In Japan, the Government should use the banking crisis to redouble its once promising drive to open up the economic system and make it more accountable to those who depend on it.

HEADLINE: Tunnel Dwellers Give Us No Easy Answers on Homelessness

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re "Homes for the Invisible" (Op- Ed, Oct. 7) by Margaret Morton, on the relocation of homeless tunnel dwellers in New York City under a Federal program set up to provide vouchers for permanent housing to people living underground:
The dilemma hinted at in Ms. Morton's bracing account merits elaboration, if only to hedge the notion that here is living proof of "solutions to homelessness." 
 Nor is the successful relocation she documented a demonstration of the economies of housing over shelter: the tunnel dwellers avoided the public shelters, after all. What we have is an object lesson in the futility of making policy through gesture.
Consider the alternative perspectives of advocates and officials.
Advocates have no choice but to welcome any addition to the housing stock for single adults and will surely labor to demonstrate that such an offer is not wasted upon those who have refused the city's grudging assistance. At the same time, they must find it troubling to target an obscure group of subterranean homeless as the object of a special set-aside of scarce housing vouchers.
When lines are long, distress is widespread and resources are slim, the logic of queue-jumping ought to have a certain face validity. Here, it seems merely the capricious chords of sympathy struck on a haphazard tour of the lower depths.
For city officials, the tunnel dwellers are a standing reproach to the public shelter system. This comes as the terms and conditions of access to the shelters are being tightened, the better to force those who have recourse elsewhere to make use of it.
Enforcement of "quality-of-life" standards in public spaces is at a postwar high. Detection of irregular accommodations rarely translates into relocation assistance.
So the lesson for city officials will be to insure that the rule of last resort continues to apply to the shelters, while disabusing those who evade the shelters of the notion that they've earned any special consideration. The message to the street-dwelling homeless? Hide better.

HEADLINE: Why Colin Powell Can't Win as Independent;
Paving the Way

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Brent Staples's "West Indian Reaganaut" (Editorial Notebook, Oct. 3) does not fully explore the nuances of that dilemma. West Indians are primarily a New York City phenomenon, where they are primarily low-level office workers, bank tellers and transit workers. They do not enjoy the nationwide visibility of black Americans or their successes.
Colin Powell's success is that of an individual who benefited from the civil rights struggles of the 1950's and 60's. Gen. Daniel (Chappie) James Jr. preceded him into the four-star ranks. 
 Black Americans have paved the way for successes by any person of color within the United States. The black American economy exceeds $400 billion a year, 100 times greater than that of all Caribbean nations and sub-Saharan Africa combined.
It is time for West Indians to criticize the system, rather than to remain quiet while others do the dirty work. Colin Powell will soon have to speak to the issues. We will then see how many whites remain colorblind to his campaign.

Responding to pleas from New Jersey's congressional delegation, the Clinton Administration has decided to retain the Coast Guard Training Center in Cape May, United States Senator Frank R. Lautenberg, Democrat of New Jersey, announced yesterday. 
 The Coast Guard had considered closing Cape May and other training centers as part of a broader consolidation. The members of Congress argued successfully that the shutdown would devastate the county's economy, since the Coast Guard is the largest single employer there.

HEADLINE: At Boeing, a War Over Job Exodus

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY EGAN 

DATELINE: SEATTLE, Oct. 13

 BODY:
The last time production workers at the Boeing Company went on strike, in 1989, the issue was too much work. Turning out airplanes at the rate of nearly one a day, they said they were exhausted by forced overtime and wanted some relief.
Six years later, the people who assemble airplanes for the world's leading jet manufacturer are again on strike. But this time their concern is too little work, which they say has them fighting for their very survival. 
 The biggest issue in the week-old Boeing strike, by the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, stems from an announcement that the company, based here, made a few months ago. For the first time in its history, Boeing said, it will try to have a majority of its work done outside the company. By contracting out 52 percent of its work rather than the current 48 percent, management said, it can save $600 million a year.
To Boeing machinists, who earn an average of $22 an hour, that announcement was like being handed a plane ticket to oblivion.
What they now realize, they say, is that even here, in a region more dependent on foreign trade than any other in the nation, playing by the rules of a global economy can exact heavy casualties. Boeing workers are in the awkward position of rooting for free trade to bring in business that keeps the company flourishing, while bemoaning one effect of an open world economy: the lower labor costs that American companies find overseas.
"I've been with Boeing since 1966, and I've given the company my knees, my back and my heart and soul," Jon Fulwiler, 47, said as he walked a picket line in the drizzle near one of Boeing's plants in the Seattle area. "What I realize this time around is that there is no other place in America where a guy like me, without a college degree, can go to make $22 an hour."
Mr. Fulwiler was surrounded by pickets carrying signs that said, "Boeing -- Stay in the U.S.A." and "Export Planes -- Not Our Jobs."
But Boeing officials say it is impossible to export planes without sending a significant number of jobs overseas as well.
Boeing is the nation's leading exporter: 70 percent of its sales are overseas, and it manufactures 6 of every 10 airplanes bought worldwide. But when a foreign nation agrees to buy planes from Boeing, it typically does so on the condition that some of the work will be done in that country.
Beyond those contract requirements, Boeing has been trying to cut costs by having more of its work done either overseas or by nonunion contractors in the United States.
"Our customers -- airlines and governments alike -- tell us our products simply cost too much," Boeing's chairman, Frank Shrontz, and its president, Phil Condit, said in a letter to machinists before their vote to strike last week. "We need to take decisive action to control our destiny. If we don't, our competitors will control it for us."
The machinists, while concerned about Boeing's demand that they pay more of their health insurance premiums and accept a wage increase of about 3 percent in a three-year contract, say pay and benefits are not the real issues. They want the right to review work that is going outside the company and to offer an alternative bid for that work, demands that Boeing says are not feasible.
"Wages are not the issue -- we make good money," said Dave Hopkins, an 11-year employee. "But if you want to remain a world-class company, you have to retain world-class workers."
A union survey of machinists last spring showed that job security was their No. 1 concern. "Our biggest competitors are not McDonnell Douglas and the Airbus consortium of Europe," Mr. Fulwiler said. "It's workers in Mexico and Poland."
As it is, the machinists have lost a considerable number of jobs in a Boeing production cutback that resulted from hard times in the airline industry. The company now employs 105,000 people around the country, mainly in the Seattle area, down from a high of nearly 150,000 six years ago. Boeing plans to deliver 235 airplanes this year, a little more than half the 446 it delivered in 1992.
The strike has idled about one-third of the company's work force. Boeing, though slowed, expects to continue production on a limited basis by using supervisors and other employees.
Outside experts say the machinists may never be able to stem the tide of jobs flowing across the oceans.
"They're fighting a losing cause," said Prof. Charles Hill of the University of Washington School of Business. "Boeing has to get its cost structure down, because the airlines are simply not willing to pay the present price for planes."
Professor Hill said there were some things -- like making blankets and doors -- that outside contractors could do better and cheaper than can Boeing machinists. Like other experts who have studied the company, he expects production to pick up in the late 1990's, but with far fewer employees.
Boeing says it will always do the most skilled parts of its airplane assembly in the United States. Fewer than 2,000 jobs that could have been held by Boeing workers in this country have instead gone overseas, said Paul Binder, a Boeing spokesman. But the machinists' demands that such jobs stay here would ultimately put the company in decline, Mr. Binder said.
"They would rather have all the jobs for a little while," he said, "than a fair amount of jobs for infinity."
Boeing machinists say that if the company is interested in cost-cutting, it should not be giving five top executives stock options totaling nearly $6 million, as was recently announced. Boeing officials say stock options of that size are typical of compensation for leading executives of major companies.
But noting that the price of Boeing's stock had risen more than 50 percent in the last year, Connie Kelliher, a spokeswoman for the union, said: "We simply want our share. These workers helped to bring in those profits. They helped to get that stock price up."

That is the central issue in a week-old strike by Boeing production workers, many of whom gathered outside the company's headquarters in Seattle on Wednesday for a rally where they heard from Robby Stern of the Washington State Labor Council.

HEADLINE: SENATE G.O.P. UNIT UNVEILS TAX PLAN; A $245 BILLION CUT

BYLINE: By JERRY GRAY 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 13

 BODY:
Republican tax-writers in the Senate agreed today to a seven-year, $245 billion package of tax cuts that includes a $500 per-child tax credit for most families, significant reductions in capital gains taxes and a break for corporations.
Today's presentation of the majority's tax plan was the first step down a tortuous road for the tax bill, which has drawn nearly universal opposition from Democrats and the White House and only grudging support from some Senate Republicans. 
 The tax package must be approved by the full Finance Committee -- a formality since the Republicans hold a majority -- and then placed in a huge reconciliation bill that includes the welfare and Medicare programs among others. Senator Bob Dole of Kansas, the majority leader, said he expected the tax package to go to committee by next week and the reconciliation bill to be voted on by Oct. 24.
It is likely, nonetheless, that a bill resembling the one presented today will ultimately make its way to President Clinton, and almost equally likely that he will veto it.
Senator William V. Roth Jr. of Delaware, the chairman of the Finance Committee, released only a bare-bones sketch of the tax plan today, saying that staff members were still fine-tuning some of the numbers.
But the highlight of the package is the $500-per-child credit for families, a provision that is also the centerpiece of the House's tax-cut bill. The tax credit has also become a source of wrangling by the major contenders for the Republican Presidential nomination.
Within an hour of the Republicans reaching agreement, the two leading candidates in the 10-man Republican field -- Senator Dole and Senator Phil Gramm of Texas -- had each staked out political credit for the bill.
Whatever bill clears the Senate floor must then be reconciled with the eventual House version before being sent to President Clinton, who has threatened to veto the big package over numerous of its elements.
The House of Representatives approved a seven-year, $350 billion tax cut in April, but in negotiations with the Senate agreed to lower the target to $245 billion. The House must still wrestle with how to pare its original tax savings back to the compromise level.
Even though the bottom line is identical for both chambers, there are significant differences in their versions.
The House bill makes the $500-per-child credit available to taxpayers with adjusted gross income of up to $200,000 per family. The Senate set its caps for the credit at $75,000 a year in taxable income for a single parent and $110,000 for couples. The lower caps were meant to help rebut charges by Democrats that the Republicans' tax plans favored the well-to-do.
Mr. Gramm succeeded in turning back an effort by committee colleagues to make the credit temporary, ending it in 1999. But to make it more affordable, the Senate agreed not to make it retroactive to Jan. 1, which some members had wanted in order to put the money into taxpayers' pockets next year.
"You make it retroactive, you create a big budget problem the first year," Mr. Dole said.
Both Mr. Dole and Mr. Gramm said, however, that they supported giving the tax credit to families with higher incomes as well, but neither has publicly stated a figure.
The Senate and the House are in closer step over capital gains taxes. Each plan would allow individuals to protect from income taxes 50 percent of any profit from selling securities, real estate or other assets. That would effectively reduce the capital gains tax rate for those in the highest tax bracket to 19.8 percent, from 28 percent.
For corporations, the rate would go from 35 percent to 28 percent in the Senate plan and to 25 percent in the House version.
Both plans offer major changes in Individual Retirement Accounts, which allow savers to deduct $2,000 in contributions to such accounts.
Although the Republicans did not give full details of the changes today, they said that the bill would allow penalty-free withdrawals from I.R.A.s for first-time home purchases, major medical expenses, long-term unemployment and for college education. All taxpayers, including homemakers with no income, would be allowed to set aside $2,000 in an I.R.A.
The Senate plan also would phase out certain corporate tax breaks, like the credit that some pharmaceutical manufacturers receive in Puerto Rico and other United States territories. But to offset that tax bite, the Republicans would extend other corporate tax breaks for research and development and the creation of drugs to treat rare diseases.
The Senate agreement came after two days of closed-door negotiations among the 11 Republican members of the tax-writing Finance Committee. Democrats, who hold nine seats on the committee, refused to participate, saying that whatever the outcome they would probably oppose the package.
In a televised interview nearly two weeks ago, Mr. Dole had cast doubt on whether the Senate would support the entire $245 billion tax cut. The majority leader said that even some of the most conservative Republicans were worried about the wisdom of giving such a large tax cut at a time when Congress was trying to balance the budget by 2002.
But Mr. Dole backpedaled from that position under a withering attack from Mr. Gramm and other Republican Presidential rivals.
By the time the Senate Republicans finally sat down to work out a tax plan this week, the fight had shifted to another front.
"What the battle was over here was temporary versus permanent," Mr. Gramm said. "That's where the basic struggle has been in the last few days."
Mr. Gramm, the newest member of the committee, led a group of hard-line conservatives who threatened to oppose any deal that did not include permanent tax cuts and a bottom line of $245 billion.
The Texas Senator's threat was more than just political bluster. With the 11-to-9 party split on the Finance Committee, a single Republican defection would create a tie vote and a defeat of the legislation in committee.

HEADLINE: For Gingrich the Conqueror, a New Role: Conciliator

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINES 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 13

 BODY:
Is Newt Gingrich still leading the tiger, or is he riding it?
As an ever-more-rancorous debate over balancing the budget edges toward some ill-defined climax, maybe this month, maybe next, it is no longer so easy to tell. 
 For nine months nobody doubted that Mr. Gingrich, the revolutionary-turned-House Speaker, was the field general in the Republican march toward small government. He goaded Republican members of Appropriations subcommittees at swords' point into cutting programs they wanted to preserve and harangued Republican moderates into rubber-stamping tax cuts they believed unnecessary.
But now that his efforts have brought the Republicans to the brink of a huge legislative coup, he must begin to play another role: peace negotiator with factions in his own House, with a less zealous Senate and with an enemy White House.
Mr. Gingrich's task is to broker a deal that will inevitably fall short of the budget-cutters' desires, but not to appear so weak in the process that he loses their confidence.
"If Newt Gingrich can't bring the revolutionaries along over there, the budget can't pass," said one Senate aide in the thick of the battle. "And even if it does pass, I still worry."
The immediate concern is to cobble together a budget that can pass the House -- no small matter, as Mr. Gingrich can alienate only 17 Republicans before losing his majority -- and still offer a starting point for talks with the Senate.
Mr. Gingrich, who is also still testing the 1996 Presidential waters, has responded with a mix of ingenuity and power. For example, he and the Senate majority leader, Bob Dole, formed steering groups this week to dovetail the two chambers' work and settle disputes early over the final language of spending bills.
Within the House, Mr. Gingrich has deftly sapped the power of committees to push through spending bills that will alienate central parts of the House Republican coalition. Gingrich task forces are aiming to produce compromises on issues like environmental spending where the party is split along ideological lines. And the Rules Committee, the gatekeeper for all bills bound for the House floor, will settle other disputes by changing the language of a bill to its liking -- which is to say, the Republican leadership's liking.
Mr. Gingrich spent two hours today making line-by-line adjustments to Medicare legislation that is scheduled to reach the Rules Committee and the House floor next week. He is said to have mollified moderates by arranging for the Rules Committee to excise several right-wing clauses from spending bills, such as one that opens an Alaskan wildlife refuge to oil drilling.
And where committees have failed to agree on cuts -- a South-Midwest brouhaha on the Agriculture Committee, for example -- the Speaker is writing compromises for the Rules Committee to insert.
Such moves have convinced many outsiders that the 1996 Federal budget, with all its explosive changes in social programs and benefits, will pass the House and the Senate with less trouble than anyone might have imagined a few months ago.
Striking a satisfactory deal with the White House, however, is a far dicier proposition.
The delicacy of the Speaker's legislative task was hinted at this week in the oratorical firefight between him and President Clinton over whose budget should become the starting point for bargaining between the two camps.
The Gingrich camp struck first by floating the notion that it might open talks if the White House would only accede to core Republican principles: erasing the deficit and cutting taxes by $245 billion, all in seven years. The White House, certain that the Speaker wanted to dicker because public opinion is turning against him, spurned the offer.
Mr. Gingrich then threatened to dump the whole budget on the President's desk hours before Federal authority to spend and borrow money expires next month. Veto it, he warned Mr. Clinton, and the Government and the global economy would be thrown into chaos.
The Speaker's lieutenants said the threat was hardly a sign of weakness, but rather a "wake-up call," a signal that Republican resolve will not collapse. But it signaled something else, too: that a good many House members are ultimately willing to shut down the Government and default on the national debt if that will force capitulation, regardless of what their leaders think.
"We could not pass a free-standing debt-limit bill in the House, period," a senior aide to House Republicans said. "We've got letters from 150, 200 people on the Republican side saying they won't sign onto a debt-limit bill without a balanced budget."
Some of them argue, populist-style, that the bondholders on Wall Street should suffer if the little guy has to keep bearing the tax burden of a mounting deficit, the aide said.
How broad and deep such passions really run in the House is impossible to tell. Some of the most ardent deficit-cutters are right-wing members of the 1992 and 1994 classes of Republican lawmakers who were swept into power on a wave of anti-Government sentiment.
But they also include long-timers like Representative Gerald B. H. Solomon of upstate New Yok, the chairman of the Rules Committee, and moderates like Representative Christopher Shays of Connecticut. Mr. Shays said this week that he may oppose even a temporary extension of the Federal debt ceiling unless the President commits to a balanced-budget amendment or other guarantee of quick fiscal balance.
Tax cuts and spending cuts are negotiable, he said, but "we will not compromise on a basic principle, and that basic principle is a balanced budget -- in seven years."
Mr. Shays said he was confident that Mr. Gingrich felt the same way. So did Representative Roger Wicker of Massachusetts, the leader of the populist freshman class, who said the first-termers' bottom line -- overhauling Medicare and welfare, and erasing the deficit in seven years -- "is the Speaker's bottom line, too."
After all, Mr. Shays said, Mr. Gingrich is the original and authentic revolutionary. And "this isn't a rebellion," he added. "A rebellion is a failed revolution. This is a revolution."

HEADLINE: U.S. REPORTS SHOW MODERATE GROWTH AND LOW INFLATION

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 13

 BODY:
Reassuring reports of low inflation and moderate growth helped propel the bond and stock markets today as more analysts became convinced that the economy was in little danger of either stalling or soaring out of control.
Consumer prices rose only one-tenth of 1 percent in September, a bit less than expected, as inflation seemed likely to finish another year under 3 percent despite four and a half years of business expansion. 
 And shoppers spent a moderate $197.5 billion last month, three-tenths of 1 percent more than in August, the Commerce Department reported, as solid and widespread advances more than offset a drop in sales at auto showrooms.
Beyond the welcome news for the financial markets, one consequence of low inflation is that more than 40 million recipients of Social Security benefits will get cost-of-living increases next year of just 2.6 percent. That matched the 2.6 percent benefits increase for 1994, the smallest since automatic adjustments began in 1975 except for a 1.3 percent rise for 1987 after a collapse in oil prices.
Bond prices, which had already been rallying overnight, powered to large gains, with the rate for the 10-year Treasury issues tumbling below 6 percent for the first time this year. Rates on the longest-term Treasury bonds fell below the level of February 1994, when the Federal Reserve began increasing short-term interest rates in an apparently successful bid to prevent the economy from overheating. [Page 33.]
Stock prices surged, but the Dow Jones industrial average, after moving well past the 4,800 level, retreated to end the day below its previous record of 4,801.80. The Dow closed at 4,793.78, up 28.90 points.
"It seems like nothing can go wrong in this economy -- at least for now," said Edward F. McKelvey, senior economist at Goldman, Sachs. "This should be very pleasing to the Federal Reserve."
For retirees, the latest inflation report means that the average monthly Social Security benefit will climb to $720 from $702, beginning with checks to be received Jan. 3. The average for an aged couple, both receiving benefits, will rise to $1,215 from $1,184, the Social Security Administration announced.
Low as the inflation rate is, some analysts believe that it could go still lower as companies find themselves unable to pass along even modest increases in costs. "Price stability has been demanded by income-constrained consumers," said Rosanne M. Cahn, an economist at CS First Boston.
Over the last year, the commodity portion of the Consumer Price Index, has climbed 1.5 percent compared with 3.4 percent for services, the Labor Department report showed. But inflation in services subsided to a 2.6 percent pace during the third quarter, one of the lowest rates since the 1960's.
"There's a lot of downward pressure on the service side of the C.P.I.," said Lincoln F. Anderson, director of economic research at Fidelity Investments, the Boston-based mutual fund giant. "There's room for optimism going forward."
And while the index benefited from a hefty 1.4 percent decline in the price of energy, which swings widely from month to month, the so-called core rate that excludes both food and energy rose a modest two-tenths of 1 percent for the fifth month in a row. This compared with higher readings each month from January through April.
Grocery store food prices advanced six-tenths of 1 percent last month, the most since April, with a huge rise for fruits and vegetables accounting for nearly three-quarters of the total. Lettuce was a big factor, jumping 25.1 percent. Meats, poultry, fish and eggs were also up significantly.
But a sharp downturn for fuel and utilities kept the rise for the important housing sector to a minimum one-tenth of 1 percent. Transportation prices eased for the third straight month as airline fares and used-car prices continued to unwind after sharp increases during the first half of the year.
Medical costs climbed three-tenths of 1 percent, and at 3.9 percent are running a full point lower so far this year than in 1994.
The Consumer Price Index for urban consumers now stands at 153.2, meaning that a basket of goods and services that cost $10 in the 1982-84 base period now costs $15.32.
The companion index covering urban wage earners and clerical workers and on which the cost-of-living adjustments are based rose two-tenths of 1 percent last month, the report also showed. It stands at 150.6.
The department also calculated that real average weekly earnings rose four-tenths of 1 percent in September.
The Commerce Department's estimate of retail sales, based on a small sample that is often revised as further data trickle in, found increases nearly across the board. The only exception was at auto dealers, where sales fell 1 percent from the previous month.
Among nondurables, sales rose 1 percent at stores selling general merchandise, seven-tenths of 1 percent at food stores, nine-tenths of 1 percent at gasoline service stations, 1.7 percent at apparel stores, 1.4 percent at drug and variety stores and one-tenth of 1 percent at restaurants and bars.
Sales of durable goods, those designed to last at least three years, were eight-tenths of 1 percent higher at stores selling furniture and other equipment for the home and six-tenths of 1 percent higher at stores selling building materials, hardware, garden supplies and mobile homes.
The department trimmed the sales gain for August to five-tenths of 1 percent from the six-tenths of 1 percent that it initially estimated.
September's sales were 4.6 percent higher than those of September 1994, for a real gain above inflation of about 2 percent.
The latest data, said Tracy Mulling, president of the National Retail Federation, "indicate that the modest growth trend has resumed and the economy is stabilizing."

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS;
Export Agency Likely to Deny China Dam Aid

BYLINE: By PAUL LEWIS 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 13

 BODY:
In response to strong pressure from the Clinton Administration, the country's chief export credit agency is not likely to help American companies win work on China's mammoth Three Gorges Dam, Administration officials said yesterday.
The Clinton Administration made its opposition to assisting the project known in a Sept. 22 memo to the Export-Import Bank, an independent agency that promotes exports by giving American companies financial support to help them win foreign contracts. 
 The Administration opposes the project because of environmental and human rights concerns, worries that protracted litigation over the project would tie up Export-Import Bank resources and doubts about the dam's financial viability. The Three Gorges project on the Yangtze River is the largest public works project in the world and is expected to cost upward of $30 billion.
While the bank is just beginning the process of considering financial aid in connection with the project, an Administration official said yesterday that the bank's own concerns about tying up its funds could be enough alone to make the bank decide not to get involved.
The White House move represents a rare occasion in which the Clinton Administration has abandoned its traditional policy of supporting American corporations seeking business overseas -- the most recent being its decision to ban domestic companies from buying oil from Iran because of that country's weapons program and support for terrorism. It is also an example of how efforts to promote trade come in conflict with political concerns.
The Administration opposition to aiding American companies complicates America's political relations with China, which have been badly strained in recent months by disputes over human rights and relations with Taiwan. President Clinton is scheduled to meet later this month in New York with Jiang Zemin, the Chinese President.
In addition, the decision will anger some major American companies, including Caterpillar Inc., the big construction-equipment manufacturer, that want to bid on the lucrative contracts in connection with the dam.
The Export-Import Bank is being forced to consider the issue because Caterpillar has formally asked the agency whether it will support its plan to bid for an undisclosed contract connected with the project, giving the company subsidized loans that would enable it to offer lower prices than it could otherwise afford.
Its request, made on Oct. 6, came about two weeks after the White House sent the bank its memorandum. While the memorandum said that American companies would still be free to bid on contracts, the absence of cheap credits is likely to make American concerns less competitive against their Japanese and other foreign rivals that have access to subsidized government credits.
Caterpillar said it was encouraged to submit its request for what is known as a "letter of interest" by Export-Import Bank officials both before and after they had received the White House memo, evidently because they wanted to bring the issue to a conclusion. "The Ex-Im Bank came to us both before and after the White House memo and encouraged us to make an application," said Bill Lane, Washington manager of government affairs for Caterpillar. "We hope that Kenneth Brody, as head of this independent agency, will make an independent decision." The bank has not yet replied to Caterpillar's request.
Mr. Lane said the contract Caterpillar is after would provide it with 1,000 man-hours of work, though he declined to disclose its dollar value.
Although the White House believes the bank should not back the Three Gorges project, the Administration nonetheless wants to avoid publicizing the decision or condemning the dam since this would further strain relations with China.
Other American companies interested in bidding for portions of the Three Gorges project are known to include Voith Hydro Inc., the United States subsidiary of the German turbine manufacturer J. M. Voith G.m.b.H. and Rotec Industries, a company specializing in heavy concrete construction.
In the White House memo, which was first reported in The Wall Street Journal today, Samuel R. Berger, deputy national security adviser, said there were three broad reasons for the Administration opposition.
"First, we think it would be unwise for the U.S. Government to align itself with a project that raises environmental and human rights concerns on the scale of the Three Gorges," the memo states.
Second, the memo cites "the legal difficulties that would be associated with any decision to provide assistance," saying that environmental and human rights groups probably would sue the bank if it became involved, leading to protracted litigation that would tie up the bank's funds.
Finally, the White House expressed concern about the project's financial viability, saying private bankers and the World Bank have raised serious questions about the Chinese Government's estimates of the project's likely cost as well as its economic benefits. And the World Bank has refused to give it any support.
But the memo concludes that to avoid damaging United States relations with China, the Administration should refrain from criticizing the dam directly or from publicizing its recommendation that the Export-Import Bank withhold financing.
The White House memo represents the outcome of an interagency review ordered by the Clinton Administration last year of President George Bush's decision not to let the United States Government become involved in the project.
"At the time it looked as if President Clinton was looking for a way to reverse the Bush decision," said Owen Lammers, executive director of International Rivers Network, a California-based environmental organization that has led the fight against the Chinese dam. "But now he has put another nail in the coffin of the Three Gorges project."
Opponents of the project say it is the largest hydroelectric project ever undertaken. The dam will flood some 350 miles of river canyon, destroying the homes and livelihoods of about 1.3 million people as well as the Three Gorges, an area that has inspired Chinese artists for centuries.
Serious questions have also been raised about the safety of the project as well as about the amount of electricity it will produce.
Local opposition to the project from those who will be displaced became so strong that in 1990 the Chinese leadership suspended it. But it was reintroduced in 1991 after a crackdown on dissidents, although a third of the deputies in the National People's Congress opposed it or abstained when it was put to a vote in April 1992.

HEADLINE: Haiti's Prime Minister Resigns After Disputes Over Economy

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER 

DATELINE: PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti, Oct. 13

 BODY:
Frustrated by his inability to gain the support of President Jean-Bertrand Aristide for economic reforms backed by the United States, the Prime Minister of Haiti has submitted his resignation, Haitian officials and foreign diplomats said today.
The decision by the Prime Minister, Smarck Michel, which has not been announced publicly, comes just before the first anniversary of Mr. Aristide's return to power after three years in exile. 
 On Sunday, Mr. Aristide is to commemorate his restoration by 20,000 American troops with ceremonies that Vice President Al Gore and the United Nations Secretary General, Boutros Boutros-Ghali, are to attend.
Mr. Michel, a businessman, was appointed Prime Minister a year ago this month and has worked closely with the United States and other foreign donors to carry out economic reforms that Mr. Aristide endorsed while in exile in Washington.
But many of the measures, intended to open up Haiti's traditionally closed economy, have been opposed by Mr. Aristide's closest advisers and most ardent followers.
Haitian and foreign officials said Mr. Michel submitted his resignation after an agitated Cabinet meeting early this week. The immediate impetus, they said, was his inability to win approval to sign an agreement that would bring Haiti $100 million in credits from the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank.
A Haitian Government official said this afternoon that Mr. Aristide attended the meeting but did not take a position for or against the measures that Haiti would have to undertake in order to obtain the money, acting instead as "a referee."
It is not clear whether Mr. Aristide has already accepted Mr. Michel's letter of resignation, which reportedly specifies Monday as his date of departure.
Mr. Aristide and his Prime Minister have also clashed over the related question of privatizing state-owned companies, including the telephone and electricity utilities, banks and the main port. Mr. Michel has been leading that effort with little visible support from the President, whose own declarations on the subject have been ambiguous.
The issue is crucial because millions of dollars in foreign assistance to Haiti are contingent on the Government's agreeing to and carrying out a comprehensive privatization program. Without those credits, Haiti is certain to encounter a severe budget shortfall, which would likely lead to rising unemployment, cutbacks in social programs, high inflation and a weakened currency.
"These guys will take a major hit" if the privatization program is not put into effect, one diplomat said.
Popular dissatisfaction with the slow pace of Haiti's economic recovery from three years of dictatorial military rule and an international embargo has led in recent months to street demonstrations.
These and other protests have been directed not at Mr. Aristide but at Mr. Michel, who is accused by some of Mr. Aristide's supporters on the left of being a pawn of the United States and the I.M.F.
Mr. Michel's position has been further weakened by parliamentary elections that have strengthened the nationalist left wing of Mr. Aristide's Lavalas movement. The new National Assembly is not scheduled to convene until Sunday, but some deputies have already demanded that Mr. Michel and other members of his economic team be tried for treason.
Other legislators, pointing out that Mr. Michel was originally appointed under the previous Parliament, have been insisting that he submit to an immediate vote of confidence. With Mr. Aristide's public expressions of support only lukewarm, it was not clear whether Mr. Michel could survive such a vote.
At the Parliament building this afternoon, speculation over a successor to Mr. Michel centered on two other members of his Cabinet, Foreign Minister Claudette Werleigh and Minister of Planning Jean-Marie Cherestal. Diplomats and businessmen here expressed concern that a larger role might be in the offing for Mr. Cherestal, who is said to have led opposition within the Cabinet to the reform package that Mr. Michel has been pushing.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Has Broad-Based Rise After Rally in Stocks and Bonds

BYLINE: By Reuters 

 BODY:
The dollar edged up against most leading currencies yesterday, lifted by rallies in stocks and bonds in the United States.
The dollar weakened in Asian trading, but buyers halted the slide just below 1.4160 marks and then took the currency higher. 
 "The market was bearish dollars going into the New York close Thursday," said Alfonso Alejo, senior trader at Sakura Bank. But yesterday morning's economic reports, showing low inflation and moderate retail spending in the United States, helped turn the sentiment around.
The Commerce Department reported that consumer prices rose one-tenth of a percent in September, less then expected. Another report said that retail sales rose a healthy three-tenths of a percent last month. The data caused bond and stock prices to surge, and the strong reactions in the markets heightened confidence in America's economy and the dollar, traders said.
"I like the dollar right now," said Scott Gromacki, a dealer at NBD Bank. "The bond market looks great, and I think the dollar will test its highs before its lows next week."
In New York trading late yesterday, the dollar rose to 100.76 Japanese yen from 100.21 yen on Thursday. The dollar also rose to 1.4265 marks from 1.4180 marks and to 1.1547 Swiss francs from 1.1489 Swiss francs. The British pound slipped to $1.5755 from $1.5761.
The dollar appears to be caught in a tight range versus the yen, with various Japanese investors seen as ready to buy the dollar below 100 yen and sell it above 101, traders said
At the same time, the yen remains weak against the mark, said Lizbeth Goldberg, assistant vice president at Bayerische Hypotheken and Wechsel Bank.
The mark-yen rate is helping to keep the dollar in a tight range of 1.40 to 1.44 marks, she noted. "We've been trading in that range for so long that the market gets blase about any changes in direction," Ms. Goldberg said. "But I think we'll see 1.44 before we see 1.40 again."
But the dollar could weaken against the mark if economic and political turmoil surrounding European monetary union flares up , analysts said.
Traders worry over a potential repeat of a recent flight to the mark, which sank the dollar. "The dollar is still anemic," Mr. Alejo of Sakura Bank said. "It's rallying, but only half-heartedly against the Europeans."

HEADLINE: S.E.C. Planning Action on Denver Bonds

BYLINE: By LESLIE WAYNE 

 BODY:
In a move that could set a significant precedent, the Securities and Exchange Commission has informed Denver officials that it plans to bring an enforcement action against them over the sale of bonds to finance the city's new airport.
Denver's city attorney, Daniel Muse, said yesterday that the city and county of Denver had received so-called Wells notices in which the S.E.C. indicated that it would bring an administrative enforcement action unless Denver officials could provide a compelling reason to stop it. 
 The S.E.C. action against Denver stems from an investigation by Federal securities regulators into whether buyers of more than $3 billion in bonds to finance the new Denver airport were adequately informed of skyrocketing cost overruns. This action could expose Denver to fines, but not criminal penalties.
Mr. Muse criticized the S.E.C.'s move, saying that his city was becoming a "guinea pig" in attempts by the S.E.C. to take the antifraud provisions of the Federal securities laws that govern corporate securities offerings and apply them to the municipal markets.
The S.E.C. does not have specific jurisdiction over the municipal bond market, which has more than $1.5 trillion in bonds outstanding. But the S.E.C.'s chairman, Arthur Levitt Jr., has long been seeking to expand the reach of his agency by arguing that the antifraud sections of Federal securities laws govern both corporate and municipal offerings.
To that end, the agency has either brought or has announced that it will bring enforcement actions in a growing number of municipal cases, including against such high-profile municipal issuers as Orange County, Calif., which sought bankruptcy protection from its creditors last year after losing more than $1 billion from high-risk investments.
Last month, the S.E.C. settled with a St. Louis municipal bond firm, Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, and received $1.4 million, in a case in which the agency accused the firm of self-dealing in its Oklahoma public finance office. The firm settled the case without admitting or denying the charges.
But what sets the Denver action apart is that it is being brought against public officials, who have not been named yet, and against a municipality itself over the issuance of bonds for public projects, said Mr. Muse, the Denver city attorney. He added the the bonds in question were all paying the interest rates offered to investors. Unlike Orange County, where the county's bonds outstanding are in default, all of Denver's airport bonds are currently trading.
"Never in the history of the Republic has this happened," Mr. Muse said. "Never has an administrative action been brought against a municipality for issuing bonds and it's not clear that the S.E.C. even has jurisdiction to do this."
Mr. Muse said it was not uncommon for large public works to have huge cost overruns and cited the Eurotunnel that connects Britain and France and the Alaskan pipeline as two examples.
"Chairman Levitt has said he wants to have broader jurisdiction over municipal offers and bringing enforcement actions against municipalities is a convenient way for him to accomplish what he wants," Mr. Muse said. "But, he's barking up the wrong tree."
The S.E.C., as a matter of policy, does not comment on cases before they are settled.

HEADLINE: Yield on 30-Year Bond Falls to 6.30%, Lowest Since Early 1994

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
The yield on the Treasury's 30-year bond dropped to 6.30 percent yesterday, returning to its level before the Federal Reserve began raising short-term interest rates in February 1994.
This lower yield -- nearly two percentage points below where it was last November -- comes amid growing optimism among market participants that the economy continues to show steady growth without accelerating inflation. In addition, there is still hope that the Clinton Administration and Congress can reach a budget compromise without either shutting down the Government when the Federal borrowing ceiling is reached shortly or defaulting on the Government's debt obligations. 
 The optimism was reinforced yesterday with the report that the Consumer Price Index rose one-tenth of 1 percent in September and that retail sales increased a modest three-tenths of 1 percent.
"I felt quite strongly before the release of the number that inflation was subdued, benign and nonthreatening," said Donald Fine, chief market analyst at Chase Securities. "Quite obviously, I still feel the same way, only more so today."
By the close of New York trading, the price of the 30-year Treasury bond gained 1 6/32 , to 107 21/32 . Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from its price, dropped to 6.30 percent, from 6.39 percent Thursday.
The yield was last at 6.30 percent on Feb. 3, 1994, a day before the Fed first tightened credit and raised the Federal funds rate a quarter of a percentage point. Investors gained $11.88 yesterday for every $1,000 of bonds held.
Short-term interest rates also moved slightly lower but they are still higher than a year ago.
Robert Brusca, chief economist at Nikko Securities International, noted "the two-year Treasury on the short end of the yield curve is now 5.65 percent, well below the Federal funds rate of 5.75 percent."
While these kinds of yields in the marketplace clearly point to an expectation that the Fed will cut rates soon, Mr. Brusca does not expect the Federal Reserve to do so. "The good inflation figure is an accommodating factor for the Fed; what it lacks is a motivating factor," he said.
And it is likely that the optimism about inflation and moderate growth will continue for the time being, analysts said.
"Given the well-behaved inflation numbers, credit markets will probably be able to tolerate much faster economic activity before they panic," said Anthony Chan, chief economist at Banc One Investment Advisers in Columbus, Ohio.
Although concern about the debt ceiling may roil the Treasury market a little as the White House and Congress near the deadline, traders do not expect the Government to default because the debt ceiling game of chicken is played almost every year, as Congress and the White House use the threat of default as a lever to get what they want.
Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin, however, seemed to heighten the tension yesterday when he told reporters attending a Business Council conference in Williamsburg, Va., that the Federal Government would run out of borrowing authority Oct. 31. This is two weeks earlier than the Nov. 15 date that had been the deadline.
But, according to Bloomberg Business News, Mr. Rubin added, "In the final analysis, the Congress of the United States is not going to want to default on the full faith and credit of the United States."
Mr. Brusca at Nikko and other analysts said they were not worried.
"We've seen it before," Mr. Brusca said. "It's a temporary thing and some accord will eventually be reached."
In trading in the futures market yesterday, the December bond contract reached a high for the second consecutive session as well as a new contract settlement high of 117 14/32 . "On the monthly chart, there appears to be nothing but air until we reach 118 27/32 ," said Robin Mesch, fixed-income analyst at Thomson Research in Boston, indicating there does not appear to be any resistance among buyers up to that price.

Retail and Price Reports Show Economy in Harmony
Consumer prices rose only one-tenth of 1 percent in September, a bit less than expected, as inflation seemed likely to finish another year under 3 percent despite four and a half years of business expansion. 
 Separately, retail sales rose a moderate three-tenths of 1 percent as shoppers spent $197.5 billion. The reports propelled the bond and stock markets as more analysts became convinced that the economy was in little danger of either stalling or soaring out of control. [Page 1.]
Stocks rallied as interest rates tumbled to a 20-month low. The Dow industrials climbed 28.90 points, to 4,793.78, and the Nasdaq index rose 2.75 points, to 1,018.38. The S.& P. index was up 1.40 points, to 584.50. [36.]
 
Senate Republicans Agree
To $245 Billion in Tax Cuts
Republican tax writers in the Senate agreed to a seven-year $245 billion package of tax cuts that includes a $500-per-child tax credit for most families, significant reductions in capital gains taxes and a break for corporations. The vote was the first step down a tortuous road for the tax bill, although a measure resembling the one presented yesterday will ultimately make its way to President Clinton, who is expected to veto it. [1.]
 
U.S. Opposes China Project
In response to strong opposition from the Clinton Administration, the country's chief export credit agency is not likely to help American companies win work on China's mammoth Three Gorges Dam. The Administration opposes the project because of environmental and human rights concerns, worries that protracted litigation over the project would tie up valuable Export-Import bank resources and doubts about the dam's financial viability. [1.]
 
RJR to Cut Work Force 5.2%
RJR Nabisco said it would move the headquarters of its international tobacco operations to Europe and cut its work force in the United States by 5.2 percent in an effort to reduce costs and bolster global sales. The moves will result in a $160 million charge. [35.]
 
Pechiney to Sell Turbine Business
Pechiney International of France announced that it was selling its turbine components business to an American joint venture of the Carlyle Group and the Thiokol Corporation for $750 million. The sale includes the Howmet Corporation, which makes cast components for gas turbine engines, and the Cercast Group, a producer of aluminum castings. [35.]
 
Denver Faces Action Over Bonds
The S.E.C. has informed Denver officials that it plans to bring an enforcement action against them over the sale of $3 billion worth of bonds to finance the city's new airport. [34.]
 
Panel Set for Communications Bill
Nearly two months after the House and Senate passed separate bills to overhaul the communications industry, the two chambers named the lawmakers who will participate in a conference committee to iron out differences. But prospects for the bill are still murky. [35.]
 
Boeing Strike Is Over Outside Work
The biggest issue in the week-old Machinists strike at Boeing is the company's announcement that in trying to save about $600 million, it will seek to have a majority of its work done outside the company. The union wants the right to review the outside work and to offer an alternative bid. [7.]
 
Book Fair No Longer a Page Turner
Once fax machines began letting agents and publishers exchange proposals across oceans, the Frankfurt Book Fair lost much of its significance and allure and now has the feeling of a tired cocktail party. Publishers still try to talk up their forthcoming titles, but as one publisher said about the fair, "Socially, it's rewarding, but that's about it." [10.]
 
Crop Estimate Jolts Coffee Prices
Coffee prices leaped more than 3 cents a pound after the Agriculture Department trimmed its estimate of this year's Brazilian crop by 5 percent. Green arabica coffee beans for December delivery rose 3.4 cents, to $1.2205 a pound, on the Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange in New York. [43.]

And Bear in Mind
(Editor's Choices of other recent books of particular interest)
 
ALBERT SPEER: HIS BATTLE WITH TRUTH, by Gitta Sereny. (Knopf, $35.) The author, a lifelong student of the Nazi bosses and for years a friend of Speer, who served Hitler as Minister of Armaments, examines his stratagems to avoid knowing exactly what it was that he knew.
 
CASINO: Love and Honor in Las Vegas, by Nicholas Pileggi. (Simon & Schuster, $24.) The unease and aimlessness of the gangster life, captured fly-on-the-wall fashion and conveyed in the perceptions of the crooks themselves.
 
EDWARD HOPPER: An Intimate Biography, by Gail Levin. (Knopf, $35.) Ms. Levin's sixth book on Hopper only peripherally concerns Hopper's art; it's a nearly flawless account of the life of a great American painter whose temperament, especially in respect of his weirdly long-suffering and combative wife, was simply abominable.
 
THE END OF AFFLUENCE: The Causes and Consequences of America's Economic Dilemma, by Jeffrey Madrick. (Random House, $22.) A journalist turned economic historian argues that historical changes have killed the prosperity many Americans remember, and that no economic or political nostrums can bring it back.

HEART: A Memoir, by Lance Morrow. (Warner, $22.95.) A moving work of literal introspection: in the wake of his second heart attack and second bypass operation, Mr. Morrow tries to find out what's really wrong with his life and himself.
 
THE HUSBANDS: An Account of Books 3 and 4 of Homer's "Iliad," by Christopher Logue. (Farrar, Straus & Giroux, $19.) A heroic, often brilliant, portion of the author's long-term project of bringing this distant, uncomfortable, alien poem closer to readers of contemporary poetry.
 
PALIMPSEST: A Memoir, by Gore Vidal. (Random House, $27.50.) As Mr. Vidal recalls his first 39 years (1925-64), his abundant self-admiration escapes self-absorption, and many people he did not care for receive at least the tribute of his keen attention. Too bad for them!
 
PANAMA, by Eric Zencey. (Farrar, Straus & Giroux, $24.) Henry Adams (yes, the Henry Adams) turns private investigator in this complex, ambitious detective novel, which starts in Panama but moves to the Paris of the 1890's.
 
WILLIAM MORRIS: A Life for Our Time, by Fiona MacCarthy. (Knopf, $45.) A witty, shrewd, learned full-scale biography of the great 19th-century English designer whose amazing versatility (propaganda was one of his skills) has always made his center hard to find.
 
WRITING HOME, by Alan Bennett. (Random House, $25.) Notes, prefaces, diary entries and fugitive pieces, charming and insightful, by the slyest of contemporary British playwrights.

HEADLINE: NEWT'S REAL TARGET: THE OTHER ROOSEVELT

BYLINE: By WALTER RUSSELL MEAD; Walter Russell Mead is the President's Fellow at the World Policy Institute at the New School. Research assistance was provided by Tomas Matza.

 BODY:
THE TROUBLE WITH THEODORE," HIS FRIENDS USED to say, "is that he wants to be the bride at every wedding and the corpse at every funeral."
Newt Gingrich is the only politician today with anything like Teddy Roosevelt's capacity to grab public attention, and the resemblances don't stop there. Roosevelt struck his contemporaries as an overgrown boy. Newt has the same mix of half-charming, half-alarming enthusiasm, impulsiveness and -- sometimes -- lack of judgment and perspective. Both men were fascinated by dead animals: the Bull Moose shot big game in Africa. The Bull Newt speculates about a real-life Jurassic Park. 
 They are also big-game hunters in the swamp of American politics, and in 1994 the Bull Newt bagged his first trophy kill. The Congressional election spelled the end of the Democratic era in Congress. There may never be another. Even so, the crisis of the Democrats is also bad news for the Republicans. The Democrats may be disintegrating, but as Newt Gingrich tries to exorcise the spirit of Franklin Roosevelt from American life, his real job is to get the ghost of the other Roosevelt -- the progressive, big-government Theodore -- out of the Republican Party.
Both of the great American political parties are in trouble, and the Democrats -- the oldest continuously functioning political party in the world -- may be on the verge of death. Sensing the disarray among the parties, many pundits predict the imminent demise of the two-party system.
Wrong. Underneath the surface turbulence, the political system remains extraordinarily resilient. The United States has been divided into two parties since George Washington's day. The Hamiltonian party -- variously known through history as the Federalists, the Whigs and most recently the Republicans -- was the party of a strong national Government in alliance with big business. The Jeffersonian party, known for most of its history as the Democrats, supported states' rights, hated the cultural elite and thought that the major banks and businesses were in unholy league with foreigners to undermine the living standards of the average American family.
That conflict is once again moving to center stage, and our political parties must and will reflect it. The names may change and the current parties may rise or fall. But when the current realignment is completed, the political landscape will most likely be familiar to each one of the guys on Mount Rushmore.
For 65 years, until last November, Congress was largely a Democratic institution. Accordingly, most Democrats think of 1994 as just a brief interruption of their long-term control, particularly in the House. Few of them seem to have noticed how the ground has shifted.
What beat the Democrats in 1994 wasn't the Contract With America. It was something much bigger: a historic shift in American politics. The white South, solidly Republican at the Presidential level since 1964, is moving monolithically into the G.O.P. column for House and Senate races.
Of the 22 men sent to the Senate in 1962 by the states of the former Confederacy, 21 were Democrats. Dixie had 106 votes in the House in 1962, 99 of them Democrats. After the 1994 election, Southern Democrats held 10 Senate seats and 61 (out of 125 Southern seats) in the House. By the turn of the century, the Democrats will be lucky to have held onto more than four Senate seats and about 30 House seats.
Thus, to regain control of Congress, the Democrats must make substantial gains in the North and West. This doesn't look likely. They may hold their own in the North -- and they may even pick up some voters disgusted by G.O.P. pandering to the white South on religion and race -- but they are unlikely to offset the tidal change now under way.
 SO WHY DOES ALL THIS MEAN TROUBLE FOR THE G.O.P.? EASY question, for those who remember their history.
Ever since Abraham Lincoln debated Stephen Douglas, the G.O.P. has been a Hamiltonian party. Its founders were in the tradition of the Federalists, America's first governing party, which was crushed by the Jeffersonians in 1800. The Whigs replaced the Federalists and themselves broke up in a welter of third and fourth parties in the 1840's and 50's. Lincoln got the formula right and the Republicans stuck with it until the Depression.
The Republican Party fought the Civil War against Democrats who believed in states' rights. Like the Federalists and the Whigs, the classic G.O.P. was not only pro-big business and big government but also anti-populist. On racial issues especially, the Republicans prided themselves on their enlightened views. Woodrow Wilson, a Democrat revered today as a symbol of American high-mindedness and idealism, imposed segregation on Washington and gave a White House screening to D. W. Griffith's racist film "Birth of a Nation." Teddy Roosevelt, by contrast, shocked Southern opinion by inviting Booker T. Washington to the White House and appointing African-Americans to Federal posts in the South.
Teddy Roosevelt was one of the most vigorous exponents of Republican Hamiltonianism. While he tried to disentangle the G.O.P. from an uncritical embrace of every big business, his faith in big government remained strong. "There was a time," Roosevelt said, "when the limitation of governmental power meant increasing liberty for the people. In the present day, the limitation of governmental power, of governmental action, means the enslavement of the people by the great corporations."
Republican domination of the Presidency and Congress broke down in the Depression, when their traditional policies no longer worked; Herbert Hoover's refusal to use the full power of the Government gave Franklin Roosevelt the chance to look Hamiltonian, using the national government to bolster the national economy. With the success of the New Deal, Democrats broke out of their southern ghetto to rule for two generations. On those occasions when Republicans took power, they did so only with the help of men like Eisenhower and Nixon, whose views placed them squarely in the Hamiltonian tradition.
The current upheaval in American politics has come about because neither the Democrats nor the Republicans adequately represent either the underlying Jeffersonian or Hamiltonian parties. Ron Brown's Commerce Department and Bill Clinton's trade policy are sure enough big government, big business approaches but the Democrats' ties to labor and the left make them suspect to the business establishment.
The Republicans, on the other hand, are increasingly split between their historic Hamiltonianism and the yahoo Jeffersonianism of their new Southern allies. Jesse Helms and Strom Thurmond have little in common with Abraham Lincoln, Theodore Roosevelt or Dwight Eisenhower. Pat Robertson thinks that the world's central bankers are the lackeys of Satan, while traditional Republicans revere them as the custodians of the faith. This split can only widen. Christ and Antichrist cannot run on the same ticket.
In fact, the Democrats are all that hold the Republicans together now. Big business wants to get rid of the remaining shackles and government-imposed costs of the New Deal era. With the exception of farm subsidies, that is fine with the white South. The yahoo Jeffersonians for very different reasons also want to trim back the Government.
But once this has been accomplished there will be a struggle between the Jeffersonian and Hamiltonian wings. The winners will consolidate their hold on the Republican name; the losers will ultimately form a new party. Both sides will bid for the support of the remaining Democrats. Most conservative and liberal centrists in the Democratic Party -- people like Senators Sam Nunn and Bill Bradley -- will move toward the Hamiltonians. So will most African-Americans. Labor will be torn between the anti-business stance of the Jeffersonians and the Hamiltonian sympathy for reasonable regulation of business in the national interest.
In the end, the United States will once again have a strong two-party system, with the Republicans of 2010 possibly the rough equivalent of the Democrats of 1896. The new G.O.P. will be strong in the white South, anti-elitist and anti-big business. It will be pro-military but isolationist. It will stand for states' rights against Federal intrusions. It will be a party of protest, for those left behind by economic and social change. It will be a stormy party, combining genuine heartfelt cries for economic justice with demagogic rhetoric on subjects like immigration, culture, religion and trade. In retrospect, the 1994 election may ultimately be seen not as the triumph of the Republicans' Southern stategy, but as the triumph of the white South's Republican strategy.
The other party will be internationalist, pro-business and moderately progressive. Looking more to Theodore Roosevelt than to his cousin Franklin, it will favor a relatively strong Federal Government and a basic social safety net, but it will not attempt to recreate the network of subsidies and social programs of the New Deal era. It will be moderately conservative on social and cultural issues, but it will also be tolerant.
The next historic movement in American politics is likely to be the emergence of such a moderately progressive Hamiltonian party -- a party that might reach from Jack Kemp on the right through Colin Powell and William Weld in the center to Bill Bradley and Daniel Patrick Moynihan on the left. Jesse Jackson might not like it, but a new generation of African-American leaders would find it their least bad choice.
Thus, no matter what happens to the Republican Party, Newt's war with Teddy Roosevelt is doomed to defeat. Progressive Hamiltonianism is a permanent feature of American political life, and the Bull Moose will still be on Mt. Rushmore long after the Bull Newt has gone to that great Jurassic Park in the sky.

HEADLINE: GORE VIDAL RECEIVES A VISITOR

BYLINE: By ANDREW SOLOMONS; Andrew Solomon is a contributing writer to the Magazine. His profile of the artist Bruce Nauman appeared in March.

 BODY:
Gore Vidal's villa in Ravello, though not particularly big or grand, is as enchanting as he makes it sound: white stucco anchored miraculously into the sheer face of the cliff, 12 acres of vertical stone and terraced gardens, a pool that commands the same panorama as the house, an extra balcony for cocktails just along the rock face. Vidal's forthcoming memoir, "Palimpsest," which I have finished over breakfast, overflows with this place and its vistas: being here now is like being received at Elsinore the morning you finish "Hamlet."
"You must be Solomon," says a man, mild and tanned and middle-aged, as he helps me through the three gates between the private road and the house. He is Vidal's companion of the last 45 years, Howard Austen (ne Auster), and has a marginal presence at best in "Palimpsest." "A memoir is about what was -- if he were dead, I might examine our relationship, but I'm not about to be a recorder of domestic detail and cooks that we have had," Vidal will explain later. The secret to the sustained connection, he will add, is that they never have sex with each other. The study is the first room on the left. "Gore, this is Solomon." Austen withdraws. 
 For almost seven years, Gore Vidal has refused to talk to newspapers and magazines. (He told Hillary Clinton that he would never again do a print interview in English.) "This is the last time," he announces with grim satisfaction. I shake the hand that shook the hand that shook the hand of Wilde. We admire the variations on the view from several rooms, then settle for the day on the suede sofa in the study, Vidal reclining at one end like Xerxes, heaped on pillows, his head silhouetted against the window so that the sparkling sea seems a nimbus around his noble head. The light is kind to his 70th year, and you cannot miss the handsome shape of his face; his bare ankle on the pietra dura table top is curiously evocative of the same ankle, 45 years younger and as many years more slender, on the cover of this year's hardback reissue of "The City and the Pillar." His epigrammatic discourse -- bred in equal measure of imagination, affectation and brilliance -- is delivered in a voice as rich and smooth and alcoholic as zabaglione. Though he does not indulge the ego of the interlocutor, his manner of well-bred control is most engaging, and you can see at once why so many thousands of people slept with him (cf. "Palimpsest"), and why so many others wanted to (op. cit.). For someone whose projection of self and eros are so intertwined, growing old is unfortunate, but the effect is more anomalous than homely.
If the rest of the Democratic Party had Vidal's subtle grasp of power, we might live in the welcome compass of liberal rule, for he, by his own admission, understands domination more profoundly than most modern politicians do, and perhaps better than any other American novelist does. We begin, gently, with the past. "Harry Truman, with bipartisan support, militarized the economy so that we might be forever at war," he says, his tone grandiloquent with a thin edge of paranoiac insight. "It was just decided that we were going to stay in the war racket -- that's how we went broke. Now we have an enemy-of-the-month club. If it's not Noriega, it's Bishop in Grenada; Qaddafi, whose eyeliner is very ominous; Saddam, just like Hitler. When they get into their bunkers they always find a copy of 'Mein Kampf,' a portrait of Hitler, women's underdrawers -- which they wear -- a couple of dead Boy Scouts and three mistresses, because they do both terrible things."
Vidal's grandfather T. P. Gore was a Democratic Senator from Oklahoma who flirted with the Presidency. In 1960, Vidal himself ran for Congress in New York's 29th District (mid-Hudson), losing the race but winning more votes than any upstate Democrat in 50 years. He declined to be nominated for the United States Senate in 1962 and finished second in the California senatorial primary in 1982. "I'm shocked by the literary figures of our day who go from university to university and have no lives in the world," Vidal remarks. "What was Goethe's line? 'Talent is formed in quiet, character in the stream of the world.' I have been water-skiing on the stream of the world." Jackie Kennedy was Vidal's mother's second husband's third wife's daughter, and so Vidal was an early member of the Camelot circle. "Palimpsest" includes a series of haloed recollections about J.F.K. that unfold Talmudically from 13 pages of notes that Vidal took in 1961. "Jack believed in the cold war," he says now. "He really was a war-lover, a very, very right-wing boy from a very Catholic family; we can thank Cardinal Spellman for a good bit of the Vietnam War. Jack wanted to be a great President, and he'd figured out that the great Presidents were war Presidents."
Vidal makes you feel that the world turns as it does because of some ultra-powerful people whom he has spurned and who have excluded you. (It's an Emersonian, anti-Tolstoyan view: his "Lincoln" can be read as a rebuttal of "War and Peace.") Do not say "conspiracy": Vidal doesn't like it. "They don't have to conspire because they all think alike -- I mean, who runs The Times and Harvard and the State Department and Hollywood? The country has always been an oligarchy of money." He describes a debate with John Kenneth Galbraith and Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr.: "There is no ruling class, they said, and used as an example somebody -- Levine, I think he was called -- who was president of Du Pont, and no du Pont was. And I said: 'Yes, I've been to Nelson Rockefeller's house. He did not cook the lunch, you'll be surprised to know, but it was still his house, I'm positive, even though somebody else put the food on the table.' " Meaningful pause. "Politics was for the ones who weren't very good at business, and the family was terrified to make them president of the company. Nelson Rockefeller took it a little too far, and the family got quite upset, because the Governor of New York and the President of the United States, these are people that you hire, that you pay for, and then they do what you want them to do."
Vidal's influence disseminates through his novels. "Every Presidential candidate, even Reagan, claimed to have read 'Lincoln,' " Vidal says. "He probably colored it -- we had a version for them to color. Even Newt Gingrich said 'Lincoln' is a wonderful book. I'd like to say that professional politicians are struck by Lincoln's lack of vindictiveness, which is almost unique in American politics, but what they like about it -- it's a complete blueprint for how to become dictator of the United States and cover it with rhetoric."
It is possible to take exception to the structuring devices of Vidal's historical novels. The classical ones ("Julian," "Creation") include tedious writing, but the American series -- "Burr," "Lincoln," "1876," "Empire," "Hollywood" and "Washington, D.C." -- are strong works of fiction. They return America's history to its people, humanizing events that frighten us in their abstraction, and present logical motivations for dark circumstances we thought impossible fully to grasp. Vidal's trademark flights of fancy -- "Myra Breckinridge," "Myron," "Duluth" and "Live From Golgotha" -- are called by Italo Calvino "the hypernovel, or the novel elevated to the square or to the cube." They are evil satires that out-poststructuralize the deconstructionists; when they are not maudlin, confusing and overwritten, they are gloriously uninhibited and very funny. Vidal is also the author of screenplays and plays, and a collection of his excellent essays won the National Book Award in 1993. He is perhaps the best-selling serious writer in our language. "At something like 13 or 14, I wanted to be a politician, but knew that I was a writer, and was writing. The surprise was, just going back over it, how consistently I was myself, from a very early age."
It's an alarming consistency, demon of an aphoristic mind. "I seem to have met everyone, but I know no one," Vidal once remarked proudly. In "Palimpsest": "Sexually, [Sir Henry Channon] preferred men to women and royalty to either"; "Osbert [Sitwell] was rosy-cheeked, with small sharp eyes alongside an important nose" and, ludicrously, "Fully clothed, I got into bed with [Cecilia Sternberg] and we passed bottle back and forth, and spoke blithely of the dead."
He is a brilliant mimic: during the afternoon we spend together, he evokes Eleanor Roosevelt (" 'No dear, I'm not angry, only a little sad.' That can drive a whole family around the bend, as hers was driven"), Lyndon Johnson ("That voice makes men in Washington tremble"), Anais Nin (" 'My nerves are shattered, but I am indomitable!' I never thought women were very good at erotic writing") and Truman Capote, whom Vidal famously, and successfully, sued for libel. "Truman could not tell the truth about anything. He was a psychopath, and the lies would get crazier and crazier, and I'd watch his face as he told them, and there was a kind of rictus going on, as though he was out of control, orgasmic -- 'And then, you know, Greta Garbo got down on the waiter, and I just said, "Greta, you can't do this here, and. . . ." ' You'd have to take him away foaming. Truman thought his world was high society, never figured out that the jet set was not high society. I was not about to let him know." The witticisms fly around stinging, like an invasion of beautiful wasps. Vidal has an air of geniality throughout. ("An air of geniality isn't difficult, is it, if you're nicely brought up and have gone to dancing school?") It's basically Charisma Central in Ravello, except that Vidal does tend to relate these tales of the grand and glamorous life with that tone of exaggerated, meticulous clarity with which I.B.M. support services will explain to you a computer you thought you knew how to use.
A former President of Colombia, Alfonso Lopez, was a classmate at St. Albans; Vidal recollects that he was the first to develop pubic hair -- "Latin blood," he says. Jack Kerouac was circumcised, "to my surprise." Tennessee Williams cruised Jack Kennedy, which amused the President-to-be. Jackie douched with one foot in the bathtub and the other on the floor. Vidal's maternal grandfather once raped a blind girl; Vidal's father had three testicles. In Vidal's hands, such information is power. Regarding a battle with an editor of the Exeter literary magazine some 50 years ago: "It was a lovely victory." Meeting Norman Mailer: "Mailer tells me that I was curious about his age. . . . He says that I then calculated that I would 'win,' as I was bound, actuarially, to outlive him." On the attacks that came from the mainstream when he wrote a novel about homosexuals: "I decided that I was going to win." Of J.F.K.: "I am lucky. He was not." Elsewhere: "I had risen far higher in the world than [my mother] Nina or our other connections, excepting always Jackie . . . and I was not about to let Nina forget my victory over her." Martin Amis wrote memorably about Vidal: "He has removed pain from his own life, or narrowed it down to manageable areas; and it is one thing he cannot convincingly recreate in his own fiction. But his deeply competitive nature is still reassured to know that there is plenty of pain about."
VIDAL'S NOVEL "THE CITY AND THE pillar," with its portrayal of eminently male and athletic and "normal" homosexuality, is a landmark for the American gay movement, and Vidal is still one of America's gay role models. "It was believed in right-wing circles that I invented same sexuality in 1948 with 'The City and the Pillar,' that nothing like that had ever happened in the United States until my book. I feel like Prometheus having brought fire from heaven." But he staunchly resists the idea of gay identity. "I don't want people in ghettos. I'm a universalist. I think people should intermingle. Once you get the idea that there's such a thing as a gay sensibility, then you've got to say that there's such a thing as a straight sensibility. It's just hopeless. But if other people are going to proscribe people belonging to a nonexistent category, one must fight back with every weapon." And on the modern gay movement: "The resentments! 'I share your resentments' should be a greeting. As you enter a queer bar: 'I share your resentments, good evening, I share them. May all your resentments be mine.' My God! 'We had a wonderful day at the beach resenting consenting adults of the other sex.' " Nor does he much like the idea of gay fiction: "What on earth is that? Does that mean the book only hangs out with other books?"
Sex is as dissociated from love in Vidal's narrative of his life as in his narrative of romping, rape-happy, fabulous Myra. "If you're not in the business of baby making," he says, "the anonymous or paid encounter is far more satisfactory. It takes so much time the other way. The anonymous encounter is the pure thing. If it's somebody that you know, there's nothing exciting about it at all to me; if I know somebody in one capacity, I certainly have no interest in the other." He writes in "Palimpsest": "In my anonymous encounters, at least, I was what used to be called 'trade.' I did nothing -- deliberately at least -- to please the other. When I became too old for these attentions from the young, I paid, gladly, thus relieving myself of having to please anyone in any way." The sex with people he knew is rare and striking: he and Kerouac "both thought, even then (this was before 'On the Road'), that we owed it to literary history to couple." Vidal makes the point, emphatically, that he was the top.
But there is a figure throughout Vidal's work of "the one and only," most clearly presented as Bob in "The City and the Pillar" -- an athletic straight man who in the innocence of youth gives a perfect erotic and emotional satisfaction to another young man. In "Palimpsest," the model for this figure is revealed as Jimmie Trimble, a baseball hero from Vidal's class at St. Albans. "He was the unfinished business of my life," Vidal once told a journalist. Here he writes: "I had once been (in this very room -- and ever since?) in love." And, "We were in Arcadia." And, "We were whole." Trimble was killed at 19 in World War II, and Vidal's memoir drifts back and forth to him, an elegy to an athlete dying young that is in curious contrast to the rather hard tone of the other memories here.
In the Ravello sunshine, he declares that Trimble was his "twin" (the notion of the twin fascinates, nearly obsesses him) and that such things do not happen twice in the world -- but it seems to me that for most people, they either happen not at all or over and over again. In "Palimpsest": "I was obliged to face the fact that I was never going to make the journey from homoerotic to homosexual and so I was never going to be able to have anything other than one-sided passing sex. . . . This belated revelation was to prove a great timesaver over the years."
Vidal has kept himself out of psychotherapy of any kind, which seems to reflect an astonishing self-discipline; if ever anyone has had the painful credentials for the psychoanalysis racket that has spoiled many of our most interesting writers, it is he. He connects his resistance to sexual and emotional ties to the horrendous example of his mother, who sounds, in his description, like the worst mother anyone has ever had. "She confessed that rage made her orgasmic. I forgot to ask her if sex ever did." And: "I got one good thing from Nina. I would never marry. Ever. If they'd said, 'You'll get the White House if you have a wife and five children,' all I had to do was think of my mother and, nope, nope, no way."
A striking passage from "Lincoln":
"Oh kindness . . . !" Stevens turned to Hay. "Are you kind, sir?"
"No, sir," said Hay. "I don't think I am."
"But surely," said Chase, the only believing Christian of the three, "you try to be."
"Well, no, sir, I don't think I do. At least not very hard."
"You see, Mr. Chase? There is a candid young man. He is like me. What kindness we possess is of a general nature. You will be a statesman one day, Mr. Hay. No doubt of that."
Vidal twice in the course of a day tells how Francois Mitterand, asked what quality is most necessary in a great leader, said, "Well, I'd like to say sincerity, but I'm afraid I must say indifference." Vidal achieves much personal and literary power through the rigorous exercise of a steely disengagement. He once wrote of Mary McCarthy that she was "uncorrupted by compassion." In explicating Mitterand: "You bring yourself to the point of indifference so that you can examine a situation with as little emotion and as much logic and intelligence as you can bring to it, which you cannot bring to it if your heart is breaking." Later, he says: "Kind? Is that an adjective one uses for writing? Isn't writing more observation? You write what you see, what you hear, what you think you see, what you think you hear, what you invent. Satirists are not kindly people, and I'm a satirist. Kindness might be disabling for the novelist."
But he also says, "I can't imagine how you could write anything without empathy." No one would accuse Gore Vidal of being nice, and if he has inherited his mother's particular relationship to rage, he must live in a state of perpetual climax. But he is not (as his reputation would have it) cold; he has sometimes aspired to but has never fully achieved the statesman's indifference. He is a circumspect romantic; it is the need to transcend feeling that weighs on his heroes, from Cyrus Spitama to Lincoln to even the gorgeous Myra. The pathos and elegance of his work lie in the conflict between the bearing of a visionary if unelectable politician and the sensibility of a fine writer -- between an accomplished distance and palpably emotional self-recognition. Vidal has been water-skiing on the stream of the world for 70 years, often in choppy water; he has occasionally got wet. These days, he both resists and acknowledges his experience of loss, concentrated in the manageable metaphor of Jimmie Trimble, because he reckons his startling gift for pain mostly as a liability.
All this matters little. Vidal is on stage for the moment not for his accomplishments, but for who and how he was. His memoir sensibly tails off with the Kennedy stories, as if to freeze the image of him forever in a period we have lately gilded. Like his chum Paul Bowles, whose concerts in New York last month were jampacked, Vidal has let his artistic successes be overshadowed by his life style. If he is to remain famous, it will largely be for his writing, but at this moment, his writing is nearly irrelevant to his aura of glamour. Lacking a live Scott Fitzgerald, one clings to his voice, cynical about an era previous to the one about which we are cynical, an era whose ickiness is far enough away to seem stylish to most of us. Vidal of the memoir is, depressingly enough, as charming as a poodle skirt with a tennis sweater, as chic as old Balenciaga.

HEADLINE: ART;
Produced in the Soviet Dark, Collected by a Secret Admirer

BYLINE: By ANDREW SOLOMON; Andrew Solomon is the author of "The Irony Tower: Soviet Art in a Time of Glasnost."

DATELINE: NEW BRUNSWICK, N.J.

 BODY:
AN ENTIRE EPOCH IN RUSSIA'S cultural history now has its major repository in New Brunswick, N.J. And it has a name as unwieldy as any created by a Soviet bureaucracy: the Norton and Nancy Dodge Collection of Nonconformist Art From the Soviet Union at the Jane Voorhees Zimmerli Art Museum at Rutgers University.
But people interested in the world's most important collection of Russian dissident art from the 1950's through the 1980's will have to come here to see it, starting next Sunday. 
 The Dodge collection includes about 12,000 objects collected over 30 years. Only about 350 pieces will be on rotating display; the others are stored as a study collection, and about 3,000 have been photographed for a data base at Rutgers. The art, which until recently lived in barns on the Dodge farm in Maryland, is at last in a climate-controlled environment.
Most of the artists in the collection worked outside the mainstream in the Soviet Union and would probably have disappeared from view altogether if not for the visionary heroics of Norton Townshend Dodge, a retired professor of economics at the University of Maryland. Mr. Dodge began his secret life in Russia when he went there in 1955 without revealing to the authorities that he was writing a dissertation on Soviet tractors. He later returned many times for a book on women's contributions to the Soviet economy, a project, when he describes it, that sounds like a study in chaos.
While in Russia, he met and fell in love with the artists of the vanguard, and his collecting ventures, which began as diversions, became the true purpose of his visits. Most of the pieces he chose were produced in secret; their manufacture was dangerous and their sale or export was usually illegal. Such work was often destroyed, sometimes by the artists themselves. Whatever survived tended to fall apart later, being subjected as it was to the daily abrasions of Soviet life.
In putting together his collection, Mr. Dodge became not only the archivist of the Russian underground but also its patron saint, helping to support artists who had no official status in their country, no source of income and no chance to display their creations. He did not limit himself to the most exotic and romantic figures, however; his collection includes work by the left wing of the Union of Artists, apostates at the edge of the mainstream, as well as by figures of the true underground.
How did he get away with it? Even Mr. Dodge himself is unable to explain. Some authorities turned a blind eye; some were ignorant; some failed to understand what he was doing; many others didn't take him seriously. His modest, genial manner, rambling conversation and rumpled, walrusy appearance do not suggest a revolutionary, but in his collecting he was at least as radical as any of the artists whose work he sought.
In the late 1980's, during the first heady days of glasnost and perestroika, the work of artists like Ilya Kabakov and Erik Bulatov began to be shown in major museums in Paris, Amsterdam and New York. The artists of their circle quickly attracted a buzz of critical theory, and their work traded at very high prices.
Though the United States managed fewer good exhibitions of this work than most European countries, it did get a few important shows -- the touring exhibit "10 Plus 10" of 1989 and "Between Spring and Summer" in 1990-91 in Boston and in Tacoma, Wash. These introduced a vision as surprising to Americans as the East Village would be to the people of Russia. It was interesting to draw connections between this material and Russian art from the 1920's, which was simultaneously attracting renewed attention.
Since Constructivism and Suprematism, in their pure geometry, are necessary precursors of Modernism and Minimalism, they have been accorded strong canonical position here; but for much of this century, politics prevented a clear-eyed esthetic response to these movements. The "Great Utopia" exhibition at the Guggenheim Museum in 1992 underlined the magnificent scale and iconoclastic accomplishments of Russian post-Revolutionary art; its popularity with the public testified to a continuing fascination with that work.
But until now, the public has had little opportunity to look at what lay between the great avant-garde experiments of the 20's and the full-fledged Conceptualism of the 80's. The Dodge Collection is the missing link.
The collection includes work from the 50's, 60's, 70's and early 80's. (In the Stalinist period, nothing happened in the Soviet world of vanguard or underground art.) Close examination of the Dodge Collection explains the legacy Malevich and Kandinsky left in Russia, and it also shows the origins of the recent avant-garde art that has taken the West by storm.
The Zimmerli has devoted the bulk of its exhibition space to the Dodge Collection. "This museum was started 50 years too late for the kind of broad-based world holdings that one finds at Yale or Princeton," said Dennis Cate, the director of the Zimmerli. "But we can achieve some importance through intensive specialization." In 1991, Mr. Cate brought to the museum the 1,200-object George Riabov Collection of Russian Art, which spans six centuries and serves as an elegant background to the Dodge material.
 The main exhibition on the ground floor has been divided by Alla Rosenfeld, the curator, into a dozen or so categories: "Social and Political Commentary," "Primitivist Trends," "Geometric Abstraction" and so on. This kind of classification sometimes becomes reductively literal, as in "Religious Imagery" and "Fantasy and Surrealism." But elsewhere Ms. Rosenfeld provides lucid text panels to support her clean and intelligent displays.
Faced with an enormous collection, she has found a structure that should help viewers make some kind of sense of the art. There is an "AptArt" (Apartment Art) installation, assembled with the independent curators Margarita and Viktor Tupitsyn, which is extremely witty. The sections on "Sots Art" (Socialist Pop Art) and "Word and Image" display early work by Erik Bulatov, Viktor Pivovarov, Vadim Zakharov, Vladimir Yankilevsky, Komar and Melamid, Francisco Infante, Alexandr Kosalopov and others. It is both illuminating and strangely heartwarming to see the production of these artists, who worked so closely together and who have formed such a wide Diaspora, displayed with the intimacy with which it must have first been experienced.
 THE UPSTAIRS exhibition, installations of 16 early nonconformist artists, gives a real sense of what was going on in Russia in (mostly) the 1960's. Here are works created by names familiar in the West (Oscar Rabin, Yuri Dyshlenko, Ernst Neizvestny) and by artists highly regarded in Russia but unfamiliar here (Dmitri Krasnopevtsev, Mikhail Roginsky, Dmitri Plavinsky). There is a third part of the exhibit, a room devoted to graphic art of the Baltic Republics that underlines Mr. Dodge's geographical range.
Though the Dodge Collection has many major canvases and sculptures, only a few of the "missing link" artists who make up the bulk of these holdings are generally considered as good as those who came before or after them. But the artists' struggle to arrive at artistic truths in a society that was trying to annihilate such truths is unmistakable here.
"Russian Jewish Artists," currently at the Jewish Museum in Manhattan, spans the same decades and includes extensive loans from the Dodge Collection. That show, in chronicling Russian Jewish artists, touches on every major theme and style in Russian art of the same period. With these two exhibitions, we are given a history that has been obscure for too long. The narrative of the creation of and, at the Zimmerli, the collecting of this work casts a glow on these shows: each is like visiting a war memorial, a museum and a house of worship all in one.

HEADLINE: ARTS/ARTIFACTS;
Under the Exquisite Spell of Japanese Screens

BYLINE: By RITA REIF 

 BODY:
JAPANESE SCREENS, WITH THEIR striking images of flowers, landscapes, battles and folk tales, are back in the spotlight in America. They're being avidly collected, they're on view in major exhibitions, and, after some softening in the early 90's, the market for them shows signs of rebounding.
On Wednesday, the most important show of such works ever held in New York, "Worlds Seen and Imagined: Japanese Screens From the Idemitsu Museum of Arts," opens at the Asia Society, where it will run through December. In addition, seven screens, collected at the turn of the century by Frank Lloyd Wright, are part of an exhibition of his Japanese art at the Los Angeles County Art Museum. 
 Surprisingly, some of the 57 examples in the Asia Society exhibition were actually bought in New York in the last decade, when prices for the best Japanese screens escalated sharply at the auction houses, going from less than $100,000 to $1.8 million. Such prices were also seen at galleries as Manhattan became the dominant outpost in the West for the sale of Japanese screens. Meanwhile, in Tokyo, the Idemitsu Museum paid $3 million to $6 million for screens on several occasions.
But there were bargains too. In 1986, the museum, run by the Idemitsu petrochemical company, acquired a pair of 19th-century screens by Suzuki Kiitsu that had cost $17,600 at Christie's in New York. "I'm sure the pair is now worth more than $1 million," said Sebastian Izzard, who heads Japanese art sales at Christie's.
Leighton Longhi, a prominent dealer in New York, regrets missing out on those gloriously patterned floral screens. "That's the pair that got away," he said.
In 1988, a year after the market for Impressionist paintings took off, fueled in part by Japanese buying at auction, prices for screens finally reached six figures. That year, a Japanese dealer paid $473,000 at Sotheby's for a pair of 16th-century screens. Then, in 1991, a pair of gold-leafed screens from the 19th century were auctioned at Christie's for $440,000, more than three times what the set had sold for in 1985.
Americans began their on-again, off-again love affair with Japanese screens in the 1880's, when collectors -- most often on trips to Japan -- became mesmerized by them as exotica. The screens, of painted paper or silk, summoned up ravishing images of samurais, emperors and dancing girls in this land of fragile teacups and towering mountains. The first wave of buying eventually enriched many museums. Henry O. Havemeyer, the sugar magnate, and his wife, Louisine, gave their screens to the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Charles Lang Freer, a Detroit industrialist, sent his to the Freer Gallery of Art in Washington. Boston's two exceptional collections remained in the city: Isabella Stewart Gardner left her screens to the museum that bears her name, and William Sturgis Bigelow donated his to the Museum of Fine Arts.
After a lull during World War II, Americans resumed buying screens in Japan in the 1950's and 60's. John D. Rockefeller 3d acquired several and gave them to the Asia Society. But John W. Gruber, a New York accountant, took the auction route and rocked the market in 1990 when he sold an extraordinary 17th-century pair, depicting Kyoto street scenes, for $1.8 million at Christie's. The buyer was an unidentified Japanese museum.
Today's dedicated collectors, Mr. Longhi said, vie with American and Japanese museums for screens by famous artists. Among the top-ranking collectors who have been buying for 30 years or more are Joe D. Price, an oil heir from Oklahoma City; Mary Griggs Burke of New York, whose family was in lumber and railroading; and John Powers, a former book publisher, of Carbondale, Colo. Mr. Longhi said that at least 10 other collectors had spent several hundred thousand dollars each for one or more pairs of screens.
But the global recession in the 90's has taken its toll on medium-priced screens, costing less than $100,000. They had sold well in the 80's, but "sales are very spotty right now," Mr. Longhi said.
When it comes to the finest screens, however, even at public sales, buyers are paying large sums. "When we get the right things, we are able to sell them for strong prices," Mr. Izzard said. In 1991, Christie's sold a 16th-century pair of landscapes with monkeys for $572,000. These are now owned by the Metropolitan Museum. Last year, for $662,500, Christie's auctioned a 17th-century screen depicting a Portuguese sailing ship. Mr. Longhi bought it and sold it to the Peabody and Essex Museum in Salem, Mass. Also in 1994, Sotheby's in London auctioned a 17th-century screen, depicting six dancers, for $1.6 million, a record for a single screen.
Mr. Izzard said he was optimistic that buying would increase again, especially in America. "Screens were always much more popular here than in Europe," he said. "They work better in modern architecture than in period rooms. And screens are very large and very decorative. With a screen 5 feet high and 12 feet long, you get a lot of bang for your buck."

HEADLINE: TRAVEL ADVISORY: CORRESPONDENT'S REPORT;
Air Traffic System Feeds Flight Delays in Europe

BYLINE: By JOHN TAGLIABUE 

DATELINE: ROME

 BODY:
ALITALIA flight 3901 from Venice to Rome left 40 minutes late one sunny September day, and the pilot's excuse was one passengers heard a lot this summer on intra-European routes.
"There's just a lot of congestion in the sky," he said. 
 In fact, Alitalia was hobbled this summer by an Italian air traffic controllers' strike. But this particular flight was not among those affected, and even disregarding strikes, clogged skies sharply increased flight delays this year. This rekindled an old debate between European airlines and governments about why, every couple of years, there is an surge in delays.
From April to June, according to the 25-member Association of European Airlines, 17 percent of aircraft takeoffs were late (defined as more than 15 minutes after scheduled time), compared with 12 percent in the same period last year. In June, almost 20 percent of flights left late, the worst figure in three years.
The association's secretary general, Karl-
Heinz Neumeister, ascribed the delays to the slow pace of improvements in Europe's splintered system of air traffic control. While some delays were caused by weather or crowded airports, he said, almost two-thirds were caused by poor air traffic control.
According to a 1992 study by the association, Western Europe had 54 air traffic control centers, compared with 20 in the United States. The European centers used 31 different computerized systems made by 18 manufacturers. The airlines estimate that the excess time planes spend circling in the air or parked on runways increases the cost of their operations by about $5 billion a year. Since those costs are passed on to the customer, travelers pay an average 8 percent more per ticket, the airlines say.
The airlines are quick to point out that the situation poses no risk to travelers' safety. But that is simply because air traffic controllers limit the number of planes in the air to allow for the network's shortcomings.
At the heart of the airlines' complaint is the argument that national governments in Europe are obsessed with local sovereignty, refusing to surrender control of the skies over national territories to any supranational authority. Their association supports a plan put forward in the early 1990's by the European Civil Aviation Conference, which includes transport ministers from 33 countries, to reduce the number of control centers and to introduce the latest satellite systems. But with so many fingers in the pie, the pace of change is painfully slow.
Mr. Neumeister points to delays in implementing two key features aimed at increasing flight capacity, one called area navigation, which essentially allows aircraft to move about freely under computer control rather than within the confines of fixed flight paths, and another that will gradually reduce the height of vertical air corridors, allowing aircraft to cross over and under each other at closer intervals. The measures were supposed to be in place by the end of the decade. Both, he says, are hopelessly late.
These assertions meet harsh criticism from the Aviation Conference. Klaus Ludeloff, a spokesman for Eurocontrol, the Brussels-based organization that the conference has designated to implement change, says that in Brussels the first of a series of central flow management units, designed to replace local control centers, is functioning, and a second is planned in Frankfurt in the next year or two. Radar coverage has been improved by reducing 18 national centers to only 8.
Recently, Mr. Ludeloff said all 33 conference members committed themselves in writing to unified traffic control measures. This, of course, is no guarantee that they will live up to their commitments on time. "We are talking," he added, with a tinge of resignation, "about 33 independent states."
Not all the airlines attribute the delays to poor traffic control. Allan Solloway, a spokesman in London for British Airways, which calls itself the "On-Time Airline" but had 48 percent of its flights leave late this summer, depicted traffic control as "manageable." An Alitalia spokeswoman, Maria Bergamin, said increased traffic flow as a result of the end of Europe's long recession may also have slowed departures. Michael Lamberty, a Lufthansa spokesman in Frankfurt, emphasized airport congestion on the ground, caused by insufficient capacity at many airports and by planes lined up waiting to take off.
And not much advice is forthcoming to travelers who want to avoid the delays. They can, of course, shun peak seasons and try to skirt heavily trafficked routes like Paris to London. Or the best advice may be to test alternative modes. Travelers between Paris and London, for example, can take the Eurostar Chunnel train.

Vietnam's Tet Holiday
 Q. We plan to visit Vietnam as independent travelers next February. When is Tet, the lunar new year, and is it a good time or a bad time to be there? -- J. Tuttle, Orinda, Calif.
A. The Tet celebrations will be held from Feb. 18 to 20, and if joyous but noisy celebrations, with lots of fireworks and milling crowds, are what you have in mind then you are headed for the right place.
Many regular public activities will come to a halt as people take off from work to spend time with families and friends. Many others will be visiting Buddhist pagodas and churches and other public places. New Year's Eve, Feb. 18, is the night for joining the crowds on the streets.
If you haven't booked a hotel room by now, particularly in Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City, formerly Saigon, you might have left it too late. The Tet holiday brings thousands of people to those two cities, including Vietnamese from overseas.
And be sure your airline reservations have been made. Because of the large number of visiting Vietnamese, getting in and getting out can be a problem at Tet time.
 
 
The Train in Spain
 Q. I am planning to visit Spain this fall and want to travel by overnight train from Barcelona to Madrid. I would like to reserve sleeping-car accommodations for the journey and don't want to wait till arriving to make them. Can I can do that from the United States? -- Lawrence M. Quigley, Fair Haven, N.J.
A. Tickets and sleeping car reservations for that train can be obtained from Rail Europe, a marketing group that represents rail travel in virtually all of Continental western Europe, and big cities in eastern Europe.
This fall, from Sept. 24 to Dec. 3, the overnight train runs Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday. It leaves Barcelona Sants station at 11 P.M., arriving at Madrid Chamartin at 8 A.M. the next day.

HEADLINE: A School's Pride Suffers a Blow

BYLINE: By JACK CAVANAUGH 

 BODY:
HADDAM and Killingworth -- nestled in Middlesex County, between Long Island Sound and Middletown -- could well have inspired Norman Rockwell paintings, those that capture the essence of small-town New England. Although many of their residents commute to jobs in Middletown, Hartford and New Haven, the towns are far more close-knit than bedroom communities elsewhere. In the two communities people share a pride in the area's rustic charm and its respected regional school system, including Haddam-Killingworth High School, where the girls' field hockey team won a the state championship last year.
But that pride has suffered a severe blow since last month, when 25 of the 32 members of that field hockey team admitted shoplifting about $600 worth of merchandise from two stores while on Nantucket for a preseason scrimmage. 
 No charges were filed by the two stores, and, indeed, the Nantucket Police Chief, Randolph Norris said his department did not become aware of the incident until it began to receive calls from reporters. By then, the 25 team members, had confessed and had been suspended from school for two days.
Chief Norris said in an interview that since the stores -- which have not been identified -- elected not to press charges, his department did not see fit to get involved.
"Shoplifting is a misdemeanor, with the first such offense punishable with a fine of up to $250," he said. "And in such a situation, there's no point in us making arrests, since the matter was settled privately. And we understand that the girls made restitution." That they did, but only after the high school principal, Dr. Richard Carmelich, summoned members of the team and their parents to separate meetings in his office on Sept. 12, two days after the team returned from the weekend trip to Nantucket. Dr. Carmelich did so after the coach, Patricia Kamercia, who is a teacher at the school, informed him that the coach of the Nantucket High School field hockey team had telephoned and told her of the shoplifting accusations. Dr. Carmelich said that the girls admitted their guilt during a meeting with Ms. Kamercia on Sept. 11. At his meetings with the players and their parents, Dr. Carmelich said, he demanded that restitution be made for the stolen items, which included dresses, sweaters, costume jewelry and some other merchandise. "We were all very upset and saddened by the incident, and we think we addressed it forcefully," Dr. Carmelich said in an interview. "In addition, the parents have taken measures on their own. The girls were very forthcoming and showed remorse and realized the error of their ways."
But many townspeople in both Haddam, site of the Region 17 high school, a town of about 6,750 about 15 miles northeast of New Haven, and in Killingworth, a community of 5,000 that straddles the Connecticut River, said that the punishment was much too lenient, and that, in effect, the girls got away with stealing.
"I, like a lot of others, think they got off too easily," said the Haddam Town Clerk, Ann Huffstetler. "Why didn't they prosecute?"
Another Haddam resident, Daniel Clifford, said: "I think the girls involved should be required to do some sort of community service. After all, the incident did affect the entire community." Mr. Clifford's daughter, not a member of the hockey team, is a junior at the high school, which has a swimming pool, a television studio and amenities that other schools might envy.
Jane Carlson, an owner of the Country Market in the Higgenum section of Haddam, which includes the main shopping district and the high school, said, "A lot of people are embarrassed" by the incident. "The matter was dismissed too lightly," she said. "It also wasn't fair to the girls on the team who didn't shoplift, because a lot of people don't know who the guilty ones are. There should have been more punishment."
A year ago, the Haddam-Killingworth field hockey team was the pride of the area after winning the Class C (small school) state championship. After that accomplishment, members of the team wore their jackets, emblazoned with the school's name, proudly. But now, fearful of being taunted, some of the players have left their team jackets at home.
On the field, members of the team, which plays in the Shore Line Conference, have not encountered any taunting from opponents, said the Haddam-Killingworth High School athletic director, Jeff Talbot. "I think the other players have some empathy for our kids on the field hockey team," he said.
The shoplifting incident was the latest in a series of unpleasant events that have caused concern in the Haddam-Killingworth area, where median incomes are around $50,000, well above the state average, and where the education system benefits from tax payments from a nuclear power plant in the village of East Haddam, across the Connecticut River but a part of the town of Haddam.
In August 1994, 15 school buses that serve Region 17, which includes five schools in the two towns, were set afire and destroyed. Three young men who had recently graduated from the high school and are now attending college were arrested and are facing charges. And in recent years, the number of arrests among teen-agers on drug charges has risen to the point where several organizations have been established to try to address the problem.
The last five years have seen bitter battles over the Region 17 school budget. In 1991, for instance, it took nine referendums before voters in the two towns approved the budget. And so far this year, residents have turned down eight budget proposals. The most recent budget rejection was last Tuesday.
"I think the stress and tension over economic insecurity in the area, along with the budget and some other matters, carries down to the kids," said the Rev. Ed Cornell, the pastor of the Congregational Church in Killingworth. "I don't condone the shoplifting, but I think some of these issues affect the adolescents in a negative way. We have to find ways to let the young people let off steam in a healthy way."
Some people believe that the shoplifting incident, while embarrassing to the players, the school and to the towns, was an aberration. "These are good kids who've never been in trouble before," said Dr. Carmelich. "What they did was totally out of character and hard to explain."
He said the results of the experience were both negative and positive. "The negative impact was that both the innocent and the guilty have been treated badly by some adults," the principal said. "The positives are that the kids are glad that they got caught and that they've learned from it, although it's not the way we like them to be taught. Other kids in the school also have learned from the experience. And the matter has actually drawn the student body closer together."
Why did 25 teammates inexplicably go on a shoplifting binge?
"I think a couple of them decided to take a risk, and that the others, who would never have initiated it on their own, decided to follow the leaders," said the chairman of the Region 17 school board, Robert Norton. "And they've all learned an immense and painful lesson."
Both Dr. Carmelich and Mr. Norton pointed out that the high school, which has 520 students, had an excellent academic reputation. Approximately 90 per cent of the students go on to higher education, the principal said. He noted that the students' scores on the Scholastic Aptitude Test were consistently higher than the state and national averages. "This year, for example, the combined average score at our school was 977, compared with 908 for the rest of the state and 910 nationally," he said. "As I say, we have a terrific group of kids."
Mr. Cornell said that most townspeople are willing to look past the students' actions. "Our job is not to point fingers but to forgive them and let them know that God loves them," said Mr. Cornell, who devoted his sermon to the parable of the lost sheep on the Sunday after the incident became public.
The president of the Haddam-Killingworth High School Student Government, Molly Danaher, said she thought it was time for the towns to put the entire matter behind them.
"The kids involved are good kids, but what they did was stupid, and they know it," she said. "I guess it's just part of growing up."

HEADLINE: YOUR HOME;
Home Equity Loans

BYLINE: By JAY ROMANO 

 BODY:
IN case you haven't heard, the answer to all your financial woes -- not to mention some extra cash for a new car, a Caribbean vacation or your child's college tuition -- could be tucked away in the brick, mortar and wood you call your home.
Home equity loans (formerly called second mortgages) have become the debt of choice for borrowers and lenders alike. 
 Since 1986 -- when Congress eliminated tax deductions for interest on nearly all consumer debt other than home mortgages -- homeowners have been blitzed by lenders eager to lend large sums of money over long periods of time as quickly, easily and painlessly as possible. Consumers responded with a passion, converting billions of dollars of high-interest, nondeductible, credit-card debt into lower-interest, tax-deductible, home equity loan debt.
But as useful and economically appealing as such loans may be when used judiciously, experts say that caution and restraint must be exercised for borrowers to avoid ending up worse off financially then they were when they started. "I think it's scary," said Larry D. Powers, president of Consumer Loan Advocates, a Lake Bluff, Ill., credit counseling company. "The debt that people are absorbing nowadays is astounding."
Just a generation or two ago, Mr. Powers said, homeowners who needed a new washer and dryer would save until they had enough money to pay cash. "But now," he said, "home equity loans are so easy to get that people who need a new washer and dryer say, 'Hey, let's take out a home equity loan and throw in a new refrigerator too.' "
Indeed, he said, while lenders used to insist that home equity loans be used only to increase the value of the home itself, they now encourage borrowers to use such loans for everything from debt consolidation to college tuition. And that, experts say, is how some borrowers can get into trouble.
"Home equity loans are seen as the most wonderful invention on earth," said Dan Lieberman, president of Mirada Home Strategies, a consumer organization in Oakland, Calif. "But because of that attitude, people have a tendency to get sloppy with them." For example, Mr. Lieberman said, using a home equity loan to buy a new car initially appears attractive because the deductibility of the interest on the equity loan effectively lowers the interest rate being paid. And since home equity loans are typically repaid over longer periods of time than auto loans, the monthly payments end up lower than a four-year car loan.
But there's a catch.
"If you took a $20,000 car loan at 10 percent interest for four years, that car is going to cost you about $24,000," said Mr. Lieberman, whose company publishes a booklet detailing the fine points of home equity borrowing. But buying the same car using a 20-year home equity loan at the same interest rate, he said, would end up costing the borrower about $46,320. After the tax deduction for someone in the 28 percent bracket, the cost would be about $39,000. If that isn't frustrating enough, Mr. Lieberman said, imagine how it would feel to still be paying for that car 20 years from now.
Things get even dicier when home equity loans are used to consolidate consumer debt, even though credit-card interest rates are usually higher. "People think they're saving a huge amount of money by consolidating their credit-card debt," Mr. Lieberman said. "But unless they're paying the same total monthly amount as they were before, they're doing themselves a disservice." Again, said Mr. Lieberman, the minimum payments required under a home equity loan's extended repayment schedule could eventually eliminate any savings realized by paying off existing credit cards with the loan, even with the tax deduction.
And then there is the question of what happens when the borrower receives that first "zero balance" credit card statement in the mail. "If you can control your spending, you shouldn't have a problem," Mr. Lieberman said, adding that generally, those who can control their spending probably wouldn't need a home equity loan to consolidate their debts in the first place.
Equity lines of credit can create even more problems for undisciplined borrowers. Unlike home equity loans, which are usually fixed-interest-rate loans for a fixed period of time, equity lines of credit are typically variable-rate and open-ended.
The advantage of such loans, Mr. Lieberman said, is that money is always available and interest is charged only on money borrowed. "The problem is that people treat them like giant credit cards and go out on spending sprees," he said. "You end up spending five years paying off a two-week vacation."
Fritz Elmendorf, a spokesman for the Consumer Bankers Association, a banking industry trade association in Washington, described home equity loans and lines of credit in more glowing terms. "It's the only credit product -- outside of the first mortgage -- that a household needs," he said. "You can use it to buy a car or put the kids through college or put an addition on the house."
Indeed, most experts agree that home equity borrowing -- with its Internal Revenue Service imprimatur, relatively low interest rate and long repayment schedule -- makes sense for homeowners who need the cash stored as equity in their homes. Still, Mr. Elmendorf noted, restraint is essential for using home equity loans wisely and effectively. "It's simply a matter of not using the availability of credit to make purchases that would otherwise be unaffordable or not prudent," he said.
Robert Hobbs, deputy director of the National Consumer Law Center in Boston, said that whatever the reason for securing a loan or line of credit, borrowers should be wary of deals that appear too good to be true.
"People should be careful about teaser rates," Mr. Hobbs said, explaining that equity lines of credit are sometimes advertised with very low initial interest rates that subsequently skyrocket.
David Ginsburg, president of Loantech, a mortgage auditing company in Gaithersburg, Md., said that borrowers should "check the fine print" to see how the interest rate on a variable-rate loan is determined. Typically, he said, lenders use a widely available index -- such as the prime rate -- in conjunction with another figure, known as the margin, to calculate interest rate changes.
"The margin is a fixed amount that's added to the index to calculate the customer's interest rate," he said. "So the smaller the margin, the better for the consumer."
Mr. Ginsburg also noted that many borrowers seem to be unaware of a basic fact of life regarding home equity loans and lines of credit. "A lot of consumers still do not realize that an equity line of credit is basically a credit card secured by your home," he said. "And if you don't make your payments, the worst-case scenario is not pretty. Because if you don't pay the loan, you could lose your home."
In short, a home equity loan should be treated like fine wine: sipped slowly and savored, it can be a rewarding experience. But overindulge, and even the best wine leaves you with a heck of a hangover.

HEADLINE: Q. & A.

 BODY:

Revenue Stamps On Deeds
Q. When I purchased my house in 1963, United States revenue stamps were affixed to the deed. What are these stamps and are they still necessary? . . . Ellery H. Fancher, the Bronx. 
 A. Robert Jacobs, a Manhattan real estate lawyer, said that the stamps signify payment of a Federal tax that was imposed on the transfer of real estate at the time. The stamps were issued by the Federal government, Mr. Jacobs said, and were affixed to deeds as evidence of payment. Without such proof of payment, he said, the deed could not be recorded.
"Generally, it is the seller who pays the transfer tax," Mr. Jacobs said, explaining that when stamps were used to prove payment of the Federal transfer tax, the seller would usually write a check for the tax at the time of sale and give that check to the buyer's title company. The title company would then purchase the stamps from the Federal government, affix the stamps to the deed, and record the deed at the appropriate recorder's office.
The use of Federal tax stamps ended in 1968, said William Colavito, a Manhattan lawyer who is chairman of the Real Property Section of the New York State Bar Association.
Shortly after the Federal law expired, Mr. Colavito said, New York State enacted a state transfer tax law that imposed a tax upon most deeds at the rate of 55 cents for each $500 of consideration paid. The law was later amended to increase the rate to $2 for every $500 of consideration and remains in effect today.
As with the Federal tax law, proof of payment of the state taxes must still be provided before a deed can be recorded. "At this point, payment of the tax is indicated by a rubber stamp," said Mr. Jacobs. "That's why they don't use those interesting stamps anymore."
 
Adjusting Rent For Fuel Costs
 Q. Isn't a rent-controlled tenant required to pay a monthly fuel pass-through charge on top of his or her rent? . . . Julius Levy, Manhattan.
 A. According to an information fact sheet provided by the New York State Division of Housing and Community Renewal, a 1980 amendment to the Rent Control Law permits rent adjustments based on the changes, up or down, in the price of various types of heating fuels.
The annual rent adjustment is based on fuel price changes between the beginning and end of the prior year. Generally, 75 percent of the annual change in fuel cost is passed along to tenants on a per-room basis. If annual fuel costs decrease, and the owner fails to report the decrease to the agency and reduce rents accordingly, then all previous increases received will be suspended for a year.
Only tenants in rent-controlled apartments in New York City are subject to such fuel-cost adjustments.
To obtain a fuel-cost adjustment, a property owner must certify that he or she is maintaining essential services in the building and must serve upon each tenant a copy of the state agency's official "Owner's Report, Certification, and Notice of Fuel Cost Adjustment Eligibility." Owners must also file a copy of the report with the agency, together with a schedule of monthly rent increases for all the rent-controlled tenants subject to the adjustment.
If a tenant believes that the owner's request for the fuel-cost rent increase is inaccurate or unjustified, the tenant can challenge it by filing a special form with the agency within 30 days of receipt of notice of the increase. The appropriate form (RAC-2202.13) can be obtained by calling the agency's Rent InfoLine at (718) 739-6400.

HEADLINE: Bringing Downtown Back Up

BYLINE: By DAVID W. DUNLAP 

 BODY:
FOR the last 40 years, whenever lower Manhattan needed a shot in the arm, it came in the form of enormous new projects, each larger than the one before: Chase Manhattan Plaza in the 1950's, the World Trade Center in the 70's, Battery Park City in the 80's.
The approach in the 90's may be radically different, one that seeks to exploit the buildings that are already there. The administration of Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani has been moving on a number of fronts to encourage residential and commercial reuse: tax breaks, zoning changes and landmark designations. 
 Although construction began last month on the New York Mercantile Exchange at Battery Park City, no one expects many more groundbreakings downtown in the near future. A truer sign of the times is the Rudin family's effort to resuscitate 55 Broad Street, an empty 28-year-old tower, as the New York Information Technology Center.
Whether visionary or delusional, the possibility is also being explored of converting some distinguished but obsolete office towers into apartment buildings; cliff dwellings and aeries that would appeal to the same pioneering spirit that colonized SoHo and TriBeCa.
Which buildings? Probably those with smaller floors, which have proportionally more windows and exposures, meaning that daylight can reach more of the interior. Elevation is another factor. Even the hardiest trail-blazer is not likely to move downtown simply to live near the bottom of a dark canyon.
Taking these attributes as a guide, the Environmental Simulation Center of the New School for Social Research pinpointed on its computer model of lower Manhattan every floor 180 feet or more above sea level (typically, about 15 stories above the street), with 8,000 square feet of space or less. The results are shown above in red.
One building that stands out in this view is 40 Wall Street, on which Donald J. Trump holds a purchase option, with the view of turning it into a mixed-use building. But Mr. Trump and other prospective players downtown have been waiting for the State Legislature to act on a package of tax benefits proposed by the Giuliani administration to encourage residential conversion and commercial renovation. The bill was passed in the Assembly June 28 but was not approved by the Senate until Thursday afternoon, by a vote of 53 to 1. Senator Franz S. Leichter, Democrat of Manhattan, cast the only no vote.
"There are developers waiting in the wings for passage of the legislation," said Deputy Mayor Fran Reiter, who heads the Lower Manhattan Task Force, together with Deputy Mayor John S. Dyson. "When you look at what the Rudins have already committed to at 55 Broad Street, that's exactly the kind of investment we wanted. I think we're going to quickly see some older buildings take advantage of the benefits to do residential conversions."
The incentive package accompanies a series of zoning changes that the City Planning Commission approved Tuesday, Sept. 19, a day that may prove to have been particularly fateful for lower Manhattan. Also that day, the Landmarks Preservation Commission made the first of a new round of designations downtown and ground -- or at least landfill -- was broken for the New York Mercantile Exchange.
The exchange building, at Battery Park City, will be 15 stories high, with two 25,000-square-foot trading floors. The structure, designed by Skidmore, Owings & Merrill, is to be completed in 1997 as part of the World Financial Center. The Mercantile Exchange merged with the Commodity Exchange last year and is now composed of two divisions, known as Nymex and Comex. Officials estimated that the project would keep more than 8,000 jobs in New York.
The retention of an additional 5,000 or so jobs seemed all but guaranteed Thursday when the Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange said it would remain in lower Manhattan rather than move to Jersey City, after New York officials offered a $91 million incentive package. The New York Cotton Exchange is to vote Tuesday on whether to reconsider its planned move in light of the decision by the Coffee exchange.
Even as they play high-stakes retention games with New Jersey, city officials acknowledge that downtown will need to do more to survive than simply hold on to its reputation as a financial service center. They say it will have to grow into what planners are fond of calling a "24-hour" community: with residents, restaurants, stores, maybe even a movie theater.
"The traditional character of the area isn't what business wants today," said Joseph B. Rose, chairman of the City Planning Commission. "The good thing is that you have an immense amount to build on."
TO encourage residential conversion, a 14-year abatement is being offered on property taxes for office buildings that are turned into apartment buildings, beginning the year that a temporary certificate of occupancy is issued for the new use. The abatement is 100 percent for 10 years and then declines by increments of 20 percent over the remaining years.
In addition, a 12-year exemption is being offered from the increase in taxes that an owner would owe due to the higher assessed value of the building. The exemption would be 100 percent in the first eight years and then decline by increments of 20 percent over the following four years.
The zoning changes would relax restrictions on joint living and working spaces, make it easier to convert the very high density office towers that were built before the 1961 Zoning Resolution and allow parking to be provided in converted buildings.
"We've taken away all the regulatory impediments to adaptive reuse of these buildings," Mr. Rose said. "There's a market moment and we're very intent on not letting that moment go by."
"It's a very aggressive program," said Carl Weisbrod, president of the Alliance for Downtown New York, which manages the Lower Manhattan Business Improvement District. "The city estimates that it would produce 200 or 300 units a year. My guess is that it would be higher. People are waiting for the starting gun. Even 2,000 units will significantly change the look and feel of downtown.
"Downtown has fabulous space, spectacular views and universal access to the waterfront," he said. "It will provide a place where middle-class and upper middle-class people can live and walk to work."
But State Senator Leichter, who has questioned governmental incentives over the years, took a skeptical view of the Giuliani plan. "Government is not justified in spending money to support the creation of what is essentially luxury housing," he said.
"What economic justification is there in supporting Donald Trump's conversion of 40 Wall Street?" Mr. Leichter asked. "Is that going to bring back Wall Street and create a lot of jobs in lower Manhattan? I wonder whether we're like King Canute, telling the tide not to come in."
The downtown residential market commands rents of roughly $25 to $30 a square foot annually, or $2,100 to $2,500 monthly for a 1,000-square-foot unit. These rents are about 10 to 20 percent less than in TriBeCa and SoHo. "Without the benefits, you couldn't renovate these buildings and make them come into what the market will bear," said Ann Weisbrod, vice president for economic development at the Alliance (and no relation to Carl Weisbrod).
Residential conversion is not the only goal. To encourage commercial renovation of older buildings, a five-year abatement of existing property taxes and commercial rent taxes will be granted on space that is either newly leased or re-leased. These savings, which would be retroactive to April 1, are to be passed on to tenants. They would apply to buildings constructed before 1975.
The programs could reduce commercial occupancy costs in lower Manhattan by an average of roughly $5 a square foot a year, bringing it down to around $25 a square foot, which is competitive with new space in northern New Jersey, said Connie Fishman, director of planning and development for Deputy Mayor Reiter.
Property taxes would be cut by 50 percent for the first three years of the abatement, but the abatement cannot exceed $2.50 a square foot. The abatement would decline by one-third in the fourth year and two-thirds in the fifth year. There would be a 100 percent exemption from commercial rent taxes in the first three years. The exemption would then decline.
Among the conditions are that large tenants -- more than 50 employees -- must sign leases running at least 10 years. Smaller tenants must sign leases running at least 5 years. Tenants that are relocating must either come from Manhattan, south of 96th Street, or from outside New York City.
If a tenant is renewing, the landlord must invest at least $10 a square foot in improving tenant space or common areas. For newly leased space, the landlord must invest at least $35 a square foot.
In this category is the New York Information Technology Center, a 31-story office tower at the corner of Beaver Street with 400,000 square feet of empty space. The structure is being renovated for information and telecommunication companies, offering data transmission capabilities and rents beginning around $15 a square foot. It is to open next month.
"We're going to be the first project on line and taking advantage of the Mayor's plan almost immediately," said William C. Rudin, president of Rudin Management, which took a calculated gamble and began the renovation before the Legislature acted.
MR. RUDIN said four tenants had been signed for 25,000 square feet, with deals pending for another 150,000 square feet. "The leasing activity has gone beyond our expectations," he said.
"We're looking at our building as a prototype," Mr. Rudin said. "We're hoping this spreads beyond our building and becomes a district. You're going to have the energy of these young software entrepreneurs working around the clock."
Two blocks away is 40 Wall Street, the leasehold of which Mr. Trump intends to purchase. One possibility is a $100 million renovation of the 66-story skyscraper, built in 1929 as the Bank of the Manhattan Company headquarters, into a mixed-use building, with 160 apartments in the tower portion. The building is topped by a pyramidal copper peak that has long been one of the unofficial landmarks of downtown.
Mr. Trump startled preservationists Sept. 19 when he appeared personally before the landmarks commission to speak conditionally in favor of the official designation of 40 Wall Street. Those whose memories went back to 1980 could recall workers razing the Bonwit Teller Building on Fifth Avenue to make way for Trump Tower.
"He came down to support preservation," said Jennifer Raab, chairwoman of the landmarks commission. "People's jaws were really dropping."
For his part, Mr. Trump said: "I have a lot of respect for the current commission. Jennifer Raab's philosophy meshes with what I think, so I went down and made a lot of people very happy."
"Forty Wall Street is a great building," Mr. Trump said, "but I don't want to be inhibited from bringing it back to greatness again." For instance, he would not want to be stopped from gilding the copper top of the building. "That's an important element from a marketing standpoint," he said.
The Wall Street tower is one of about 20 buildings and a historic district in lower Manhattan that are on the landmarks agenda. The commission has already designated four structures around Bowling Green:
* 1 Broadway, which was remodeled in 1921 to serve as headquarters for J. P. Morgan's steamship combine, the International Mercantile Marine Company. On the facades are mosaic coats of arms representing the company's chief ports of call.
* 11 Broadway, completed in 1898 as the Bowling Green Offices. The facade is rich with Greek architectural elements.
* 25 Broadway, completed in 1921 as the Cunard Building. Cunard's former steamship ticket office, now a post office, has an octagonal rotunda under a 68-foot-high dome that is covered in rich and colorful murals. One of the least known and most ornate public rooms in lower Manhattan, the great hall received a separate interior landmark designation.
* 26 Broadway, completed in 1928 as the headquarters of the Standard Oil Company. A colossal oil lamp atop the building's spire still attests to its origins.
OTHER early office towers currently under consideration are the former American Express Building (65 Broadway), the Empire Building (71 Broadway), the former American Surety Building (100 Broadway) and the former Equitable Building (120 Broadway), which was so frighteningly massive that it helped spur the first Zoning Resolution in 1916.
The commission is also weighing the creation of a Stone Street Historic District, taking in 15 small buildings on two blocks south of Hanover Square, including India House, a 142-year-old individual landmark that was once home to the Cotton Exchange.
As part of the process, an economic development plan is being prepared by the Praedium Group, a real estate consulting firm, suggesting some of the uses for the buildings. And an architectural master plan has been drawn up by the firm of Beyer Blinder Belle, including streetscape and facade improvements. "It's a pre-approved plan, so you can be in and out in a week or so," Ms. Raab said.
"My goal is to have the regulatory plan approved at the same time, or very close to the same time, as the district itself," she said. "I'm trying to explain to owners that I really want to be their advocate down here. I want to help this area become revitalized."
One of the more daunting hurdles to residential revitalization is the lack of open space. A new urban design plan by Peterson Littenberg Architects, sponsored by the Battery Park City Authority and J. M. Kaplan Fund, calls for the creation of several small parks throughout lower Manhattan.
Residential buildings tend to cluster around each other, said Jon McMillan, director of planning for the authority. "If, indeed, there is so much undervalued real estate in lower Manhattan and more office space than anyone could need," he said, "why not acquire office buildings, tear them down and put in place a park? You could vastly improve the value of real estate around that park."
The computer model at the New School could be used to search for the potential locations of such parks, based on where the likeliest residential redevelopment might occur. "It allows you to poke at reality by combining visual and non-visual information," said Michael Kwartler, director of the Environmental Simulation Center.
The model can highlight dozens of attributes besides floor size and elevation -- use, age, landmark status, number of elevators, floor-to-floor height, floor area and the extent to which it exceeds or falls short of current zoning. Soon, with the addition of data on 267 buildings from Cushman & Wakefield, the model will be able to pinpoint vacancy rates as well.
The completion of the model was underwritten by the Kaplan Fund. The cochairman of the fund, Richard D. Kaplan, an architect, has taken on lower Manhattan as a kind of personal crusade.
"Those species survive that maximize available resources, I'm reminded by Darwin," he said. "The available resource of downtown is an incredible base of fantastic buildings. Now is an opportune time, as rents and prices drop, for a new kind of city to grow up out of this old one.
"Can we turn the great dowager queen of American cities into a charming princess at the ball?" Mr. Kaplan asked. "It's the first time anyone has thought of this question in an area so dense and so full of history."

GRAPHIC: Photos: A computer model of lower Manhattan by the New School's Environmental Simulation Center shows in red the kind of office floors that might be candidates for residential conversion: 8,000 square feet or less, more than 15 stories above the street. Towers with many such floors include 70 Pine Street (1), 40 Wall Street (2), 20 Exchange Place (3), 1 Wall Street (4) and 30 Broad Street (5). Trinity Church is in the foreground. (Pete S.

HEADLINE: ROAD AND RAIL;
Champions Seek Use for Old Tunnel

BYLINE: By DAVID W. CHEN 

DATELINE: EDGEWATER

 BODY:
It is literally a hole in the wall now, a place obscured by weeds and bushes, and an invitation for trash, crushed soda cans, golf balls, rags and other debris.
But the Susquehanna Tunnel was once an important rail passage cutting through the Palisades, linking the Hudson River waterfront to the state's interior. And the tunnel's storied past, as well as its possible future use as a light-rail corridor, has Albert F. Cafiero exasperated. 
 Mr. Cafiero, chairman of the Transit Committee of Bergen County, a private advocacy group, says any future use of the tunnel may be compromised by the current widening of River Road here, right across the street. "The road will destroy the right-of-way, and the tunnel as a resource is going to be lost," he said. "We can't have any more cars. We should use that tunnel."
Edgewater, county and state officials disagree that the tunnel and the road are mutually exclusive. Furthermore, they say the River Road project is crucial to alleviating stop-and-go traffic and jump-starting the borough's moribund economy.
"The two-lane road was at levels of service D and F, and the time it took to get out of a place of employment in Edgewater was 15 or 20 minutes for some people," said Chester P. Mattson, director of Bergen County's Department of Planning and Economic Development.
For those who don't know Edgewater, the one-mile tunnel might be easy to miss. It sits under an elevated stretch of River Road, a few hundred yards from the riverfront, its mouth veering away at a 45-degree angle.
It was built in 1892 at the height of industrial activity in the region. For years, the tunnel's double-track lines carried coal and other freight to the waterfront. As industries died or moved, usage dropped. In 1990, its last year of operation, only two cars traversed the tunnel each week. Now, the tracks are gone, replaced by an oil pipeline run by the Amerada Hess Corporation, said Walter Rich, president and chief executive of the New York Susquehanna and Western Railway in Cooperstown, N.Y.
The tunnel had been suggested as a passageway for the proposed Hudson-Bergen Light Rail Transit System. But it was rejected, much to Bergen County's disappointment, in favor of a tunnel in Weehawken.
Meanwhile, River Road continues to be reconfigured. For a four-mile stretch, the two-lane road will be widened to four lanes, with a fifth in the middle of intersections for left turns. The project will be done in two stages, each two miles: the southern section is expected to open by early spring, at a cost of $7 million, about half of which is coming from the developer, G. Heller Enterprises of Englewood Cliffs. The speed limit figures to be 40 miles an hour.
The widened road complements the adjacent development of Edgewater Commons, a 428,000-square-foot shopping center It is to open by June.
This is not good news for Mr. Cafiero and his allies, who fear that the road will become a highway at the foot of the Palisades and that the subsequent pollution will be too much to bear.
"Nobody is overseeing this," said Susan O'Kane, a Hoboken environmentalist, adding that the River Road project is part of a "stealth highway" from the George Washington Bridge to the Bayonne Bridge.
There is the question of cost, however. Refurbishing the tunnel would cost more than $100 million, Mr. Cafiero said, and that doesn't include the trolley system, which could cost $500 million. The road, by contrast, might run $15 million.
"That tunnel can be used, and we all like to see mass transit, but mass transit for the waterfront is 10 to 20 years away," said Mayor Bryan Christiansen of Edgewater. "Meanwhile, what does Edgewater do? Sit and watch as property values go down?"

October in Atlantic Highlands: Dancing, Music, Knockwurst, Beer

BYLINE: By CHRISTINA JOHNSON 

 BODY:
The site of what is considered New Jersey's oldest Oktoberfest is a pavilion of dark wood and brick, set high on the hills of Atlantic Highlands' Scenic Drive in Monmouth County.
Each year, the restaurant, called the Hofbrauhaus, celebrates the betrothal of Princess Therese von Sachsen-Hildburghausen to the Bavarian Crown Prince (later Ludwig I), a party that began in 1810. It has become so popular that it begins in mid-September and runs to mid-November, attracting more than 12,000 hungry, thirsty devotees who come on weekends to stuff themselves with sausages, clap to the animated cowbell musician and the three-man oom-pah band and, of course, toast the dancers. 
 The restaurant is more than 45 years old, and has been in the hands of Hilda and Thomas Lesbirel for the last 19. They intend to turn over control to their son, Christopher, soon. None of them have ever been to the ultimate Oktoberfest in Munich, they say, because Oktoberfest here has always been such madness.
Q. What is Oktoberfest about?
HILDA LESBIREL -- What is it in Munich? It's a big beer party. No one is celebrating that Prince Ludwig is married to Princess Therese. Half of them don't even know why they are there. They are just there to have a good time.
Q. And Oktoberfest beer?
CHRISTOPHER LESBIREL -- It's the first beer of the season. It's a little darker than amber in color and has a slightly caramel-y flavor. They do serve it a little warmer in Germany than we do.
Q. Why are there so few German restaurants?
HILDA -- What has happened is that no one has come from Germany any more. All the Germans came over after the war, you see, because of economic conditions at that time. Those people are now in their 60's and 70's. The tradition is slowly being lost. Second-generation Germans, if there's something to celebrate, they're out, but they don't eat the German food as much. It's very, very hearty food. It's not at all good if you are calorie-conscious, and this is what has happened.
Q. What is German food?
THOMAS LESBIREL -- Mostly meat. There's the traditional knockwurst, bratwurst, smoked pork chops. We also have the rouladen, which is the rolled beef stuffed with onions, pickles and mustard; we have an Oktoberfest sampler platter where you get the rouladen, the traditional pork schnitzel and one sausage, served with the German noodle spatzle, covered with a nice hearty brown sauce. Don't forget the kalbshaxen, which is the veal shank. It's the whole lower leg of the veal. There's probably a pound of meat on it. It's served on a platter with a knife sticking out of the top of it. That's for the big eater.
Q. Do people eat this way every day?
HILDA -- Absolutely not. At one point in time in southern Bavaria, they were farmers; they ate like this every day. They also worked in the fields every day. And in the cities, no one eats like this because everyone would be 250 pounds.
Q. Are there many Germans in this area?
HILDA -- Union was at one point heavily populated by Germans, as was New Brunswick, with Germans and Hungarians.
Q. People are eating less meat and drinking less, and there are fewer native Germans. Does that make you nervous?
THOMAS -- We look at it this way: We are one of the few surviving German restaurants. There's not a lot of competition. There's only three of us in New Jersey that operate a brauhaus with entertainment. So yes, is there a time when our menu may have to totally change with our restaurant? Yes. CHRISTINA JOHNSON

VILLELLA'S TROUPE
Edward Villella, the American dancer-choreographer who helped change America's stereotypical perception of male ballet dancers, brings his Miami City Ballet to the Performing Arts Center at Purchase College today at 3 P.M. 
 Drawn from the New York City Ballet, Dance Theater of Harlem, the Joffrey Ballet and the Boston Ballet, the 33 members of the troupe exemplify Mr. Villella's own energetic and technically precise style. Formed in 1986, the company has performed throughout the United States, Europe, Israel, South America and Central America.
Mr. Villella was heavily influenced by Balanchine during his years with the New York City Ballet as a member of the corps and later as a principal dancer from 1957 through the 60's. In 1975 he won an Emmy for his CBS television production of "Harlequin," and he later produced and directed the Public Broadcasting Service's "Dance in America" series for a year and a half.
Tickets for today's performance are $21 to $40 and may be obtained by calling 251-6200 or Ticketmaster at 454-3388.
 
ON WOMEN'S FORUM
 Two women who attended the World Women's Conference in Beijing will talk about the experience today at 2 P.M. in the White Plains Library at 100 Martine Avenue.
Leila Doss, retired United Nations Assistant Secretary General for Personnel Services, was an accredited observer at the Intergovernmental Conference from Sept. 4 through 15, representing the Federation of Associations of Former International Civil Servants.
Nancy M. Yanofsky attended the Non-Governmental Forum in Hairou from Aug. 30 through Sept. 8 as executive director of the Pro Choice Resource Center of Mamaroneck.
The program, to which admission is free, has been sponsored by the League of Women Voters of Westchester and the library. Call 422-1400 for more information.
 
ART EXHIBITION
 Igor Trout Fine Arts, a four-month-old gallery in New Rochelle, has a new exhibition opening on Thursday, featuring the work of the partner-owners Gail Nicholson and Richard Leon. Paintings and pastels of their travels through Spain, Mexico, Central America and the United States are indicative of their admiration for the representational-expressionist style of the Bay City School in San Francisco, best exemplified by Richard Diebenkorn.
Igor Trout is a play on the name of a well-known art dealer in Manhattan: Ivan Carp. The entrance to the high-ceilinged, large-windowed studio, warmed by carpeting and draperies, is on Memorial Highway, but the address is 519 Main Street over the Starlite Deli.
Also exhibited are works by Marne Rizika, Michael Morse, Robert Nickson and Paul Jumar, former classmates of Ms. Nicholson and Mr. Leon at the Art Students League in Manhattan. In its continuing campaign to revitalize the downtown area through the arts, the city made several vacant storefronts available to the gallery's artists as exhibition space.
Viewing hours at Igor Trout are Mondays through Fridays from 5 to 7 P.M. and Saturdays from noon to 5 P.M. "We haven't given up our day jobs yet," Mr. Leon said, explaining the limited weekday hours. He is a building contractor, and Ms. Nicholson is a freelance textile designer. An opening reception will be held on Thursday from 5 to 9 P.M. and an open house is scheduled on Saturday from noon to 5 P.M. For more information, call 654-9330.
 
THREE EXHIBITIONS
 Three simultaneous exhibitions sponsored by the Westchester Arts Council may be seen through Nov. 23 at the Association of Community Based Artists of Westchester in Mount Vernon, at Pace University Choate House Gallery in Pleasantville and the Rye Arts Center in Rye.
Three variations on a theme, allocated respectively to each venue are "Cultural Fantasies," "Natural Fantasies" and "Fantasy in Form," executed in a variety of mediums by 50 emerging and established professional artists who live or work in the county. A few of the names are Diane Brawarsky, Blanche Dolmatch, Nils Hill, Linda Nisselson, Creighton Michael and Michael Torlen.
Rosemary Cohane Erpf, curator of the show, chose the theme after viewing works in numerous slide registries, museums, galleries and studios.
The Acbaw Center, at 128 South Fourth Avenue, is open Tuesdays through Saturdays from 10 A.M. to 4 P.M. and the phone number is 667- 7278. For hours at Pace on Bedford Road (Route 117), call 773-3694. Hours at the Rye Art Center, 51 Milton Road, are Mondays through Fridays, 9:30 A.M. to 12:30 P.M. and 1:30 to 5 P.M.; Saturdays from 1 to 4 P.M. The phone number there is 967-0700.
 
FALL FOLIAGE RUN
 There is still time to enter the Scarsdale Historical Society's Annual Fall Foliage 3.1-mile run today at 3 P.M., or the 1.55-mile walk at 2:30. Check-in time is from 1 to 2:30 at the society headquarters, 937 Post Road, Scarsdale, and registration fees are $10, $8 for people younger than 18.
Tom Kline, a master walker (masters are at least 50 years old), will give a brief talk on walking and health at 1:30.
Awards will be presented to the first three top male and female runners according to age groups, and trophies will go to the overall male and female winners and to the winning male and female masters. The phone number for more information is 723-1744.

 Dr. Richard Jogodnik, veterinarian, wildlife expert and head instructor of Trout Unlimited Inc. Fishing Schools, will be the speaker at the organization's monthly meeting on Tuesday at 7:30 P.M. at the Fox Lane Middle School on Route 172 in Mount Kisco.
His subject will be a premiere fishery in the country, exceptional for running ice-cold through the middle of the New Mexico desert. He will discuss fishing and wildlife in and around the San Juan River in Navajo Dam, N.M., and the tourist area of Mesa Verde National Park.
Trout Unlimited meetings are free. The nonprofit ecological organization monitors natural water resources and reservoir systems for fishing potential.For more information about the program or classes in fly-fishing, call 941-6342.
 
LECTURE ON IRAQ
 A section of southern Iraq that was virtually unknown to the outside world until the late 1980's will be revealed in a talk by Edward Orchsenschlager, professor of anthropology and archeology at Brooklyn College. He will speak today at 3 P.M. at the Desmond-Fish Library in Garrison-on-Hudson.
As part of a series of expeditions undertaken by the Institute of Fine Arts of New York University and the Metropolitan Museum of Art beginning in 1968, Lagash, the ancient capital of Sumeria, now known as Al-Hiba, was studied in an effort to better understand its early and current cultures.

HEADLINE: A Fulbright Winner Is Off to Sri Lanka

BYLINE: By CHUCK SLATER 

 BODY:
I'M an adventurer at heart," said Dana Quante, a 29-year-old graduate of White Plains High School and Nazareth College of Rochester. Today she will begin a very special adventure: an academic year's study in Sri Lanka on a Fulbright Fellowship.
Not that Ms. Quante spent the summer at her family's White Plains home -- she was on a summer scholarship in Italy, studying Italian at the walled medieval city of Siena. But a Fulbright is, well, very special. 
 Of 4,488 applications for Fulbrights from the American academic community last spring, only 885 were granted. In New York State, Ms. Quante is one of 87 successful candidates among 546 applicants. Since the late Senator J. W. Fulbright was instrumental in the 1946 Congressional legislation "to foster mutual understanding among nations through educational and cultural exchange," about 200,000 college graduates and postgraduates have taken part in the Fulbright program.
Ms. Quante is well suited to it. Besides her love of adventure, she carries a 3.98 grade-point average from Nazareth.
"The director says Dana was the best of the bunch of undergraduates chosen," said Dr. Alec Southerland, the English professor at Nazareth who is the Fulbright program representative on the campus. "She is extraordinarily versatile and a very quick study."
Also, enthusiastic. Ms. Quante's voice fairly bubbled over the phone from London as she talked about her coming adventure.
"I will be attending the University of Peradeniya in the center of the island," she said, "near the large city of Kandy. I will be studying the ancient language of Pali, the canonical and liturgical language of Buddhism.
"Pali is a dead language related to Sanskrit and spoken in the western part of India during the time of the Buddha. That was circa 500 B.C.E. -- Before the Common Era, to be politically correct.
"What I will be studying is the Pali Canon, called Tipitaka. My proposal entails, hopefully, a collection of poems in this Tipitaka, which are attributed to women elders of early Buddhism. This will parallel a study of women's religious and socioeconomic authority and autonomy today."
Ms. Quante, who was in London being prepared by Tissa Jayatilaka, a Sri Lankan representative of the United States Educational Foundation, said she was impressed by what she has learned of Sri Lankan women.
"Sri Lanka is a very special nation in South Asia," she said. "It is special economically. The human development index is 86, which is quite high. Women's literacy is 87 percent, which is tremendous for a so-called third world country."
There is also a 12-year-old civil war going on in Sri Lanka, formerly Ceylon. The adventurer shrugs it off. "I'm definitely not in danger," she said. "The Fulbright committee wouldn't have sent me if I were."
Her mother tries to shrug it off. "I'm a little nervous," Nancy Quante said. "But she tells me not to worry."
Ms. Quante, the fifth of six children, has been surprising her mother for a long time.
"When she was 2, she suddenly recited the alphabet backward," Mrs. Quante recalled. "We didn't know she knew it forward. "As a child, the encyclopedia was her basic recreational reading."
As a child, Dana was partly responsible for her family's move from the Bronx to White Plains. "One of her teachers in the Bronx thought it would be better for her academic growth," Mrs. Quante said.
Hank Quante, Dana's father, has worked his way up from an employee to the owner of the Gedney Way gas station in White Plains. He said he is a little awed by his daughter's award. "I didn't realize just how big a deal the Fulbright is," he said, "but my customers keep congratulating me."
In her Fulbright presentation, Ms. Quante wrote, "You've got to remember, I'm a blue-collar girl from the Bronx." She does.
In the telephone interview from London, she said: "My whole personality was formed in my early childhood in the Bronx. I always go back to that center inside me."
Professor Southerland, who himself completed a Fulbright in Sri Lanka, said: "Her versatility comes partly from having met all kinds of people. She has also worked all kinds of jobs."
Ms. Quante interrupted her college education to work as the house manager of a professional regional theater in Rochester. "You meet a few hundred different people a night," she said.
Starting today, she will be meeting a lot more.
"The Sri Lankans I have met are extremely gracious, inquisitive and lovely," she said. "I can't wait. I love to travel. I love to adapt to a new culture."
Even if it means a change in hair style. She has always worn her brown hair short, but Ms. Quante has not introduced it to a scissors in some time. "For Sri Lankan women," she explained, "their long hair is their pride."

HEADLINE: No Easy Way To Benefit In Britain

BYLINE: By PETER TRUELL 

 BODY:
SO, can Americans profit from the hundreds of millions of dollars in foreign investment that Britain is attracting?
Surely all the savvy stateside investor has to do is identify a few fast-growing British companies that stand to profit from the trend, snap up their shares on the London Stock Exchange and watch their prices rise. 
 If only it were that simple. First, there is the currency risk. If the dollar continues to strengthen against the pound, as many expect it to do, American investors in Britain could take a foreign-exchange hit that would reduce or wipe out gains in the sterling value of their holdings.
Unlike Americans, the Germans, Swiss, Japanese and other big investors in Britain have comparatively strong currencies, which allow them to find good value for relatively low prices when they buy stocks in Britain.
It is no surprise, therefore, that Germany's Siemens and Dresdner Bank, Switzerland's Swiss Bank Corporation and Japan's Nissan and Fujitsu are among the biggest foreign companies investing in Britain. Their home currencies are strong, unlike the dollar.
"When you have a high foreign currency, you can use that to your advantage," said Peter Canelo, an equity strategist at the New York office of NatWest Markets, a unit of National Westminster Bank P.L.C., a big British bank. "You really need superior currency value to take advantage of this. When the currency is on the floor, you're a good seller and not a good buyer."
And there are other potential risks. As in the United States, the threat of a major stock market correction looms in Britain. In both countries, a long bull market has pushed prices close to all-time highs and made bargains scarce.
True, the influx of foreign money is bolstering Britain's economy, but these benefits have largely been factored into British stock prices, economists at brokerage firms in London said.
"It's improved the trade deficit; it's helped to improve management standards in the U.K.; it's taught lessons here. There are positive knock-on effects," said Gavyn Davies, head of research at Goldman, Sachs & Company's London office. But, he added, "It's not obvious how [the American investor] can benefit" from the trend.
ONE strategy suggested by Mr. Davies and by Paul C. Walton, an equity market strategist at Goldman, Sachs, was to buy shares in British companies like GKN P.L.C. and Lucas Industries, which make industrial equipment, and Unitech, which makes electronics parts. All three are likely to be suppliers to foreign companies setting up in Britain.
But, they cautioned, a lot of the smart money in Britain seems to be focusing more on potential players in the current wave of mergers and acquisitions than on beneficiaries of foreign investment.
Some analysts suggest that Americans eager to put their money in foreign stocks might be better off shopping around in Asia or elsewhere in Europe.
Merrill Lynch's international investment strategists, for example, are cautious on Europe in general.
As for Britain, "we've got a moderate underweight on it now," said Thomas C. van Leuven, an international investment strategist at Merrill Lynch in New York. "The U.K. is starting to resemble the U.S.; we see investors getting a little nervous about the earnings outlook."
In Europe, Mr. van Leuven added, "We like the peripheral markets, like Sweden, Spain, Switzerland and Finland."

HEADLINE: MARKET WATCH;
In Japan's Facade Of Control

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER; Floyd Norris is on vacation this week.

 BODY:
When the main measure of power in the world was military might, great and small powers dissembled with statistics inflating or minimizing their arsenals. Nowadays, in the struggle to attract capital or keep investors from fleeing, countries are perfecting the art of dissembling by omission.
Last year's champion was Mexico, which hid the numbers that would have tipped off investors that an impending devaluation of the peso was imminent. When the bad news seeped out, investors not only raced for the exits, they pulled out of other emerging markets -- the "contagion effect" that that Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin feared would circle the globe. 
 Now Japan, a country that usually drowns in statistical measures of itself, seems intent on seizing this year's title. This week, its ministry of finance admitted that it knew in early August that one of the country's biggest banks lost $1.1 billion during an 11-year fraud at its New York subsidiary. But rather than warn the Federal Reserve and the Treasury that a host of American laws had likely been violated, the financial leaders of the world's second largest economy clammed up for six weeks.
Mr. Rubin, who has championed greater disclosure rules in the post-Mexico era, offered a little lecture when his Japanese counterpart, Masayoshi Takemura, called Wednesday with what was later termed an apology on these shores and a nonapology in Tokyo. Credibility in the markets, he said, means spreading the bad news, as the United States did after the 1987 crash. Anything short of full candor, he told Mr. Takemura, undermines confidence in global markets.
There is reason to wonder if the message sunk in. "I don't think there was anything improper in what we have done," said Eisuke Sakakibara, a top official of the ministry and the leader of a camp that questions how closely Japan should align itself with the United States. He and others attributed the disagreement to "cultural differences."
There are many cultural differences with Japan; this is not one of them. If a Japanese bank president tried to keep such data from all-knowing Finance Ministry -- rather than from foreign authorities -- he would soon be refilling teller machines in the most frigid reaches of Hokkaido. Japan didn't get its reputation as the world's most regulated capitalist economy for nothing.
What was at work here was a radically different perception of national interest. The first instinct of United States regulators would likely be to embarrass and punish the offending bank, to set an example. In Japan, the first instinct is to say nothing that would tear down the banking system's facade of stability. After all, these are the same banks that went to extraordinary lengths to halt all major land transactions as soon as the real estate market began to collapse: If everyone knew how far prices had really fallen, the banks knew they would have to re-evaluate their portfolios and dramatically slash the value of their assets. That self-deception delayed the recognition of how serious Japan's banking crisis had become.
The United States and Japan like to say that despite their constant bickering on trade, their governments work hand-in-glove on the important stuff. But Japan, like Mexico, now joins the ranks of countries where investors will no longer fully believe the government officials who insist that everything is under control.

HEADLINE: Smitten by Britain, Business Rushes In

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: NEWCASTLE, England

 BODY:
NORTHEAST England is littered with dead and dying industries of yore. There are the coal mines, now just holes in the ground, that fueled the Industrial Revolution. There are the shipyards, now largely desolate, that helped Britannia rule the waves. There are the steel mills, now almost silent, that once roared with the nation's economic might.
But alongside those industrial dinosaurs, a new economy is emerging. Lucky Goldstar, the South Korean electronics company, just opened a gleaming new, $45 million television and microwave-oven factory in the area. After looking at sites all over Europe, Siemens of Germany recently announced that it would build a huge, $1.7 billion semiconductor plant here, and Fujitsu of Japan is doubling the size of its four-year-old chip plant. Nissan of Japan is expanding its nearby car factory. 
 In politics as in geography, Britain has long been on the fringes of Europe. But, as northeast England's experience suggests, it is increasingly seen as ground zero by companies all over the world needing a manufacturing base for the European single market.
Britain draws more foreign direct investment in new factories, research centers and other business operations -- and the jobs that go with them -- than any other country in Europe.
The volume has clearly surged since former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher took office in 1979 and began her free-market revolution. For example, the number of foreign projects more than doubled to 434 in the 1995 fiscal year ended June 30 from 183 in 1980, while the number of jobs those projects created, or kept from moving to other countries, rose to 88,000 from 14,000.
Japan alone announced 44 projects last year, seven more than in the entire period of 1980 to 1986, according to the Japanese Embassy here.
The influx has by no means solved all of the Newcastle area's economic problems, or Britain's. And it is hardly unusual for jobs to migrate to regions where unemployment is high, especially if governments and workers bend over backward to lure and accommodate employers. In an age of ruthless global competition, though, when corporate investment decisions can amount to a highly visible plebiscite on the economic future of the countries in which the companies do business, the investment flow to Britain has drawn the attention of other European nations.
For years, much of Europe derided Britain for creating a low-wage, low-security economy -- one far closer to the American model of flexible work forces and intense pressure to drive down costs than to the European tradition of high pay, lavish benefits, strong unions, restrictive work rules, generous social welfare systems and high taxes.
Now, however, policy makers in other countries are looking more closely at the British experience as they grapple with high unemployment and eroding international competitiveness. France's unemployment rate this year of 11.5 percent, for example, is more than three points above Britain's, but its average manufacturing labor costs are 30 percent higher. Britain's unemployment rate in August was 8.2 percent. Germany has a slightly lower rate at 8.1 percent, but its wage costs are nearly double Britain's.
Bernd Pischetsrieder, chairman of the German automaker BMW, said Britain had gotten a huge head start over the rest of Europe in making the wrenching policy changes necessary to compete in the global economy. Last year, BMW bought the British car maker Rover.
"Great Britain is currently the most attractive country among all European locations for the production of cars," Mr. Pischetsrieder said at an industry conference in Cambridge, England, last week. "This results from the structural reforms initiated by Margaret Thatcher in the early 1980's, the most significant factor of course being the rearrangement of industrial relations between companies and trade unions."
Noting that the United States invested 7.5 times as much in Britain between 1986 and 1993 as in Germany, Mr. Pischetsrieder added: "The bottom line is that what you started in Great Britain back in the early 1980's, other European countries still have to do today. They have to initiate a process of structural renewal on all levels and in all significant areas."
In Britain itself, some of the most economically deprived regions are grudgingly reassessing their longstanding antipathy to the policies pursued by the Conservative Government over the last 16 years, first under Mrs. Thatcher and now under her successor, John Major. Those policies include weakening the power of unions, resisting calls for a minimum wage, refusing to adopt European Union regulations protecting workers' rights and generally letting free-market forces, rather than government intervention, shape the economy.
 AROUND Newcastle, those policies were seen by most people as causing considerable pain as the region's old economy died out over the last two decades, pushing unemployment rates to more than 20 percent at their peak at the end of the 1980's and creating considerable social tension and political disaffection.
Now foreign investment is holding out the promise of an economic rebirth, albeit one shorn of the assurances of lifetime work and relatively high wages that workers once thought they could count on. While Newcastle still has some of the country's worst poverty, and the crime and other social problems that go with it, its unemployment rate has moved steadily down into the mid-teens.
As a result, even some people suspicious of the Conservative Party's ideology are asking a prickly political question: Is the new economy, and the brighter future it promises, the legacy of Thatcherism?
Ross Forbes, for one, is having trouble making up his mind about Mrs. Thatcher's legacy. A few years ago, Mr. Forbes was working for the National Union of Mineworkers, battling the Government's plans to close more of the region's pits and put thousands of miners out of work at a time when the other backbones of the regional economy were also breaking. (In 1975, 35 percent of the region's employment was in coal, shipbuilding and steel. Today it is less than 1 percent.)
Now Mr. Forbes is the communications manager for the North Tyneside Council, one of the local governments in the area, helping to promote the region's attractiveness to foreign investors. The Conservatives "did not have to go as far as they did" in closing unprofitable mines and allowing the region to go through such intense economic pain in the name of allowing the market to do its work, he said. "The treatment of the northeast region in the 1980's was bloody."
On the other hand, Mr. Forbes said, "There are rules in the global market that the National Union of Mineworkers could not rewrite."
The region is still a bastion of support for the opposition Labor Party. But even Labor, which a decade ago was fighting ferociously but unsuccessfully to restore the power of unions and force the government to take a more interventionist approach to the economy, has now embraced a market-driven economic policy and is de-emphasizing its historic links to unions.
Labor's economic policies, in fact, are increasingly difficult to distinguish from those of the Conservatives. As it has moved to the right, its popularity has risen sharply, and it now is far ahead of the Conservatives in the opinion polls. Around Newcastle, that means a growing acceptance that perhaps the changes of the Thatcher years contributed to putting Britain into something closer to international fighting trim than it was two decades ago.
"If the object is to attract investment on a global basis, someone has got the formula right," Mr. Forbes said.
That formula, he said, encompasses many factors, including the cooperation of unions, local and national government agencies and universities, but also undoubtedly the pro-business environment at the heart of Thatcherism.
"Five years ago I would have been a cynic about the ability of [foreign] investment to transform an area," Mr. Forbes said. Now, he said, he is a believer.
Thatcherism, of course, was aimed more at reinvigorating domestic industry than at attracting foreign companies. While there is a consensus that British industry is more vibrant and competitive now than 15 years ago, particularly in industries that were privatized under the Conservatives, Britain is by no means a world beater economically.
But while Germany is seeing corporate trend setters like Daimler-Benz and Volkswagen moving production to lower-cost sites, and while France has retained its traditional indifference to foreign investors, along with its high unemployment rates, Britain is at least reaping the benefits that come with new employers and the jobs and technologies they bring.
"The U.K. has a long tradition of welcoming inward investment, under Labor as well as under Conservative Governments before Mrs. Thatcher, but the increase has certainly been influenced by the Thatcherite changes that took place," said Sir Geoffrey Owen, the head of the Business Policy Program at the London School of Economics. "Certainly France and Germany are looking at the U.K. and the economic and political developments here and seeing what can be learned from it."
American companies have a long tradition of investing in Britain, which over the last several decades has been the site of more United States direct investment than any other country. In 1993, the most recent year for which figures were available, Britain accounted for 17.4 percent of America's direct investment worldwide and 35 percent of its direct investment in Europe.
But Britain's appeal is now much broader. Over the last decade, Britain has become the primary European location for the three big Japanese car companies, Nissan, Toyota and Honda. In the last year or two it has emerged as the No. 1 European choice for many Asian electronics companies, including Samsung of Korea; Fujitsu, and Lucky Goldstar's LG Electronics. At the same time it is attracting more investment from German and other European manufacturers who want to expand outside of their high-cost home markets; the recent Siemens deal and BMW's acquisition of Rover are the two most prominent examples.
THE surge of foreign investment is being driven by many factors, not least of which is that Britain, a trading nation throughout its history, has always sought out foreign investment more aggressively than its European neighbors have.
It does not hurt that English is almost always the first or second language of international companies. At the moment, Britain has a relatively weak currency, making goods exported from here more competitive in other European markets.
But in the end, most companies are looking for the best available combination of work force skills and flexibility and low costs. Different companies have different needs. In semiconductor manufacturing, labor costs are a small portion of total production costs. But Siemens found Britain attractive because the looser workplace restrictions made it cheaper and easier to run its new plant in the Newcastle area in three shifts around the clock than it could have elsewhere in Europe.
Lucky Goldstar had run a smaller microwave-oven plant in the Newcastle area for several years before deciding last year to build its much bigger new plant. But the company reviewed its British operation and its other big European plant, in Germany, where it produced televisions, and decided to move TV manufacturing to the new British plant.
"The cost structure in the U.K. is much more competitive than in mainland European countries," said Ray Couch, the new plant's personnel manager. "The casualty from our plant is the German factory, because we've taken their TV business from them."

HEADLINE: MUTUAL FUNDS;
Not for Do-Gooders: The Sex, Drugs and Rock 'n' Roll Fund

BYLINE: By NICK RAVO 

 BODY:
TIRED of all those whiny liberals who run so-called socially responsible mutual funds, the ones that shun companies that make booze or bombs?
 Then meet Burton Morgan, an irascible, 79-year-old bean farmer from Hudson, Ohio, who has created the nation's first socially irresponsible fund: Morgan Funshares.
The small, closed-end fund owns stakes in companies that profit from tobacco (Philip Morris), liquor (Seagram) and gambling (Circus Circus Enterprises), in addition to companies that sell condoms (Carter-Wallace) and lingerie (Frederick's of Hollywood). By some accounts, sin stocks all. 
 "We consider this to be a fund invested in consumer, nondurable goods that tend to be habitual," said Robert F. Pincus, a vice president of Maxus Asset Management in Cleveland and a manager of the fund.
Less prurient holdings include soft-drink sellers (Coca-Cola and Pepsico), media and entertainment conglomerates (Walt Disney and Time Warner) and a chewing gum maker (Wrigley).
"The fund is not as racy as it tries to make itself out to be," said S. Olivia Barbee, an analyst at Morningstar, the mutual fund research company in Chicago, who follows Morgan Funshares. "They own a lot of large-cap, well-diversified companies. For instance, Carter-Wallace makes condoms, but they also make Arrid Extra Dry."
Mr. Morgan is not only the fund's founder, but its largest shareholder, with about 43 percent of the shares. A farmer with a mechanical engineering degree from Purdue University, he helped Johnson & Johnson design a machine to make miniature Band-Aids; built a $400 million adhesive paper company, Morgan Adhesives; started a venture capital company, Basic Search, and made a mint on his large stake in R. J. Reynolds when the company became the subject of a leveraged buyout in 1988.
Mr. Morgan came up with the Funshares idea 15 years ago, called it Sinshares and kept it a private affair, for a few family members only. "It was just a joke," he said. But after several years of strong performance, he took the fund public 18 months ago.
"I really just wanted a fund that would be Depression-proof," he said. "I lived through a Depression, and it still scares me to death.
As he sees it, there are necessities and then there are necessities. "The theory is that there are certain things that people will not give up, no matter how poor they are," explained Mr. Morgan, a teetotaler and a nonsmoker. "They'll drink to their last nickel, smoke till they are dead."
He dropped "sin" from the fund's name after chatting with John Templeton, the pre-eminent investor of the Templeton family of mutual funds and a religious man, at a meeting in, well, Las Vegas, Nev.
"I told him about my fund, and he said it was a good idea, but he asked me if I knew what sin was," Mr. Morgan recalled. "I said, 'Yes, sin is what your mother told you not to do.'
"And he said, 'Oh no, that's not sin.' Then he told me about the seven deadly sins, and he named them -- apathy, pride, gluttony, all those bad things," Mr. Morgan said. "Just after that, I went home and changed the name of the fund."
With a mere $5.3 million in assets, the fund is one of the smallest closed-end funds tracked by Morningstar. It is trading at $8 a share over-the-counter, a 10.3 percent discount from its net asset value of $8.92 a share. Over the fund's life, it has traded at an average discount of 6.91 percent. A discount means anyone who bought the fund at its current price would profit if the marketprice merely rose to the underlying value of the fund's assets.
With his fear of economic downturns and the flood of redemptions that could follow, Mr. Morgan originally planned an open-end mutual fund with a whopping 10 percent sales charge when shares were redeemed, but was talked out of the idea. "I wanted to make it chicken-proof," he said. "If you chicken out, you don't get all your money back."
The fund carries a 1 percent management fee and pays an annual dividend. Last year, the dividend was 3 cents a share, a yield of less than 1 percent. "That might go up a little this year, because last year we had a lot of legal and accounting expenses," Mr. Pincus said.
Right now, the fund owns stock in just 20 companies. Among its largest positions are Johnson & Johnson, Time Warner and Philip Morris. Its cash hoard is 7.5 percent of assets, roughly the average for stock funds.
Even though he is not a fund manager, Mr. Morgan wields considerable influence. "We don't buy anything unless we both agree," he said of his relationship with Mr. Pincus. "And we never sell. That's my credo. Never sell."
Mr. Pincus begs to differ, noting that the fund has sold shares in the Huffy Corporation and in Morgan Foods, a Cleveland company not related to Mr. Morgan. "We're not comfortable saying we never sell," Mr. Pincus said. "But we are comfortable saying that we look for long-term growth."
For the year through Sept. 30, the net asset value of Morgan Funshares rose 22.9 percent, according to Morningstar, just trailing the Standard & Poor's 500 index. The share price was up 14.3 percent.
The fund, however, has outperformed many of the 42 socially responsible funds in Morningstar's data base. The Timothy Plan, a small fund that eschews stocks in companies involved in gambling, tobacco, abortion or pornography, gained only 7.45 percent for the year through Sept. 30.
Goody-goodies don't always come in last, though. The Domini 400 Social Equity, a market-weighted index of corporations that pass several broad tests -- no sales derived from weapon-related products nor any stake in nuclear power plants -- has returned 30.83 percent this year to investors in its open-end fund.
"We started up the fund, I wrote to a law professor and he wrote back, saying, 'When you come up with a sin index, I'll invest,' " said Peter D. Kinder, president of the five-year-old Domini Social Equity, which is based in Cambridge, Mass. "I always thought there was a market for something like that."
He cautioned that it was premature to judge his young fund or Morgan Funshares a success or a failure. "We will not know until we have been through a full market cycle," Mr. Kinder said.
Lest anyone think that Mr. Morgan has a hard heart, he says he contributes 20 percent of his gross income to charity and runs a charitable foundation, which has grown to $34 million in assets.
"Now that is socially responsible," he said. "If you want to make money, go ahead, invest and make money. And if you want to be socially responsible, give to charity."

OMERTA, JAPANESE STYLE
 
Who Knew What When?
The Daiwa Bank's loss of $1.1 billion because of one employee's unauthorized trading in U.S. Treasuries left egg all over the bank's top executives. Now the stain has spread: six weeks weeks before Daiwa notified American regulators of its problem, it told the Japanese Government -- which decided this was not information it had to share with Washington. At best, Tokyo's secrecy was a serious breach of protocol at a time when the two Governments were trying to sort out various financial issues -- and when concerns about the shaky underpinnings of some Japanese banks had reached the point that American institutions were charging a premium for lines of credit extended to Japan. A phone call between Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin and Japan's Finance Minister, Masayoshia Takemura, seemed to do little to mend the fence: Treasury officials said the Japanese had expressed regret; the Japanese insisted that they had not apologized and that American regulators were upset because of "cultural differences." In any event, said the Vice Minister of Finance, Kyosuke Shinozawa, it was Daiwa's responsibility to inform the United States, not the ministry's.
 
THE HIGH-TECH YO-YO
 
Which Way to Jump?
In the latest pang for all those heavily invested in high technology, the sector took a nose dive on Monday, with the Nasdaq composite down 2.7 percent, precipitated by Novell's announcement of anticipated lower earnings, followed by Motorola profits that disappointed some investors. By Tuesday's opening, the Dow had been dragged down 65 points. But then investors dived back in, and yet again The Selloff had become The Buying Opportunity. By week's end the markets were setting or flirting with records.
 
LABOR
 
Flight Attendants Win a Round
In a rare success for organized labor, arbitrators awarded the flight attendants union at American Airlines a 17 percent salary increase over four years and maintained vacation time at current levels. The 20,000 flight attendants at American struck just before Thanksgiving 1993; they returned to work five days later after President Clinton twisted the arm of Robert L. Crandall, the chairman of AMR, which owns the airline, until he agreed to arbitration. The arbitrators did grant American the right to reduce staffing on some flights.
 
GOODBYE
 
Manzi Bails Out at I.B.M.
In the credit markets, three months is short term. But that's not how Jim P. Manzi, chief executive of Lotus Development, sees things. After quickly giving in to I.B.M.'s takeover offer last summer, Mr. Manzi pledged to stay with Big Blue for "the long haul." Ninety-nine days later, he has walked away, saying he was not "the right person" to run a division at I.B.M., where no one seemed to be crying at the news. If Lotus's software geniuses were to follow Mr. Manzi out the door, that could change quickly.
 
CYBERSPACE
 
Roadworks Ahead
Weaknesses in the structural integrity of the Internet could allow a criminal to divert documents or transactions transmitted over computer networks, researchers at the University of California warned. The problem requires more than a hot patch on the information superhighway, the experts say, urging businesses to contain their enthusiasm for digital commerce until adequate safeguards are in place.
 
BANKING
 
New Week, New Merger
Forging a combination that would dominate banking in metropolitan Philadelphia, Core states Financial agreed to acquire Meridian Bancorp for $3.2 billion in stock. As banking mergers grew to fever pitch earlier this year, Meridian held out. But Corestates turned up the heat after an unsuccessful pass at the Bank of Boston. Corestates said the combined company would close or sell 115 branches and trim nearly 2,000 jobs, about 10 percent of its staff.
 
BORDER WAR
 
Coffee Exchange to Stay Put
Grabbing the gold ring offered by New York city and state officials, the Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange said it would remain in Manhattan and build a new home, rather than move to Jersey City as it had planned. New York officials hoped the Cotton Exchange would similarly reverse course. By agreeing to put up $91 million in subsidies, the officials said, they were saving 5,000 New York jobs.
 
WAR CHEST
 
A Reserve Against Speculators
Finance ministers from the world's richest nations agreed to set up a $50 billion fund to combat currency crises. The money would be available to the International Monetary Fund to make loans to countries suffering from capital flight. Even as the pool was established, brush fires flared in Europe, where speculators pressured the French franc and the lira.
 
NOBEL PRIZE
 
A Rite of Fall
It's a harbinger of the season, like leaves turning colors: Each year -- five of the last six, anyway -- the Nobel jurors look to the University of Chicago to award the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economics. This time around the winner was Robert E. Lucas Jr., whose influential research in macroeconomics encouraged skepticism about the ability of Government policy makers to fine-tune the economy. A man for the times.

HEADLINE: BEHIND THE WHEEL/Saab 9000 CS;
A No-Nonsense Swede With Excellent Lungs

BYLINE: By PETER PASSELL 

 BODY:
"FIND your own road," urges the advertising for Saab, which, translated from copywriter-speak, means: "We make these really weird cars. But if you have a mind of your own, you'll probably like them." And few Saabs illustrate the point better than the Saab 9000 CS, a bulky hatchback that does just about everything very well.
Start with the interior. Every auto company has learned a thing or two in the last few years about making cars roomier on the inside and smaller on the outside. Yet the 9000 CS is cavernous in comparison with the Toyota Camry, the gold standard of midsized sedans -- and actually a bit shorter. 
 The space behind the fifth door of this hatchback can swallow 24 cubic feet of luggage, half again more than the trunk of a Mercedes-Benz S-Class. If you insist on bringing along the refrigerator, the rear seats fold flat to create a yawning cavity of 56 cubic feet.
The no-nonsense Swedes who design Saabs do not believe in cosseting their customers. Even equipped with optional leather seats, the 9000 CS has a faintly military feel, with its attache-size storage pockets on the doors and expanses of unadorned plastic paneling.
Get past the impression that this Saab is a giant Tonka toy, though, and you'll notice how much thought went into the 9000 CS. The front seats are almost high and wide enough to pass for captain's chairs in a mini-van, and they are individually heated for winter driving. The rear seats offer limousine-like legroom. All four headrests are softly padded and angled forward, where they belong to prevent whiplash.
Buttons (except for those on the B-plus audio system) are lucidly marked and easily reached. The automatic climate control responds to the humidity as well as the temperature, running the defrosters and adjusting the vents for maximum comfort and fog-free windows.
None of this would matter much if the 9000 CS lacked muscle or pleasing road manners. But here again, Saab charts its own unorthodox route to excellence.
Consider the engine. In the 1980's, turbocharging -- forcing extra air into the cylinders with a compressor -- was widely used to coax oomph-on-demand from small engines. Turbochargers were often unreliable and always kicked in with an irritating lag. But they sipped less fuel than bigger engines with equal performance, and they gave wannabe racers an opportunity to pretend they were dashing for the checkered flag at Le Mans.
Then gas prices plunged and Americans once again asked for engines that purred and throttles that responded at a touch. Most makers of expensive cars abandoned both turbochargers and small power plants, replacing them with normally aspirated six- and eight-cylinder engines that used electronics to keep the lid on fuel consumption.
But Saab is still following its own road, employing engine technology that it calls Ecopower -- for economical, "ecologically responsible" and powerful. If you insist, you can buy a gussied-up 9000 with a nice 3-liter V6 made by Saab's co-owner, General Motors. But rather than abandon the turbocharged four-cylinder that has served Saabs so well (and remains available in the 9000 CSE and 9000 Aero), the company has refined the concept.
With a 1995 price of $29,845, the 9000 CS comes with a 2.3-liter, 4-cylinder, 16-valve engine that gets a boost from a newfangled "light pressure" turbocharger. Gone are the characteristic turbo-whistle and turbo-lag, not to mention the expensive microprocessor and sensors needed to prevent high-pressure turbos from vanishing in a puff of smoke at awkward moments. What's left is a seamless 170 horsepower, enough to haul this 3,170-pound vehicle from zero to 60 in less than 8 seconds.
As important, the light-pressure turbo is there to help at relatively low engine speeds, providing plenty of kick for freeway ramps or passing on hills, and at no sacrifice in mileage. The 9000 CS, defined by the Environmental Protection Agency as a full-size car, rates 21 miles per gallon in city driving and 29 on the highway with the 5-speed manual transmission (17 and 25 with a four-speed automatic).
The front-wheel-drive 9000 CS is made to survive Swedish winters. Standard equipment includes a fuss-free five-speed standard transmission, dual air bags and four-wheel-disk brakes with an anti-lock feature. A competent suspension eats bumps without disguising the feel of the road. But this is no sports car: push it hard on the curves and both body roll and resistance in the steering gently remind you to act like an adult.
Saabs have never sold well in a "near luxury" market crowded with quieter, better-looking, more refined cars from Nissan, Mazda, Toyota and BMW. But such comparisons are unfair. The 9000 CS is as roomy as the cavernous Chrysler Concorde and as versatile as the Volvo 850 station wagon, and it rides a lot better on asphalt than the Jeep Grand Cherokee.
This hefty Swedish hatchback with a hefty sticker price (often heavily discounted, mind you) is plainly not everyone's cup of lingonberry tea. It could probably win over a lot of the skeptics, though, if only they gave it a chance.

INSIDE TRACK: A masterpiece of function for big-car buyers not overly concerned with form.

HEADLINE: Tough Tariff Measures Were Followed by the Great Depression

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"Buchanan's Tough Tariff Talk Rattles G.O.P." (front page, Oct. 8) reports on one of the major campaign themes of the Republican Presidential contender Patrick J. Buchanan: a call for the imposition of higher import tariffs as a means of curing the chronic United States trade deficit. 
 Are new tariffs a good idea? On balance, do Americans and the United States economy stand to benefit from such a protectionist measure? The modern record stretching back to the tariff law known as the Smoot-Hawley Act suggests the opposite.
 This notorious legislation was passed by Congress in June 1929, and stock market developments that year -- while affected by many factors -- did not portend a ringing endorsement of this legislative initiative.
Before long, the trade war escalated as American customs duties rose on average to a high level -- just below 50 percent -- and 25 countries took retaliatory measures and raised duties on imports from the United States. The full effect of the tariff law on the Great Depression is subject to debate, but there is little doubt that the trade war further retarded international trade and the American economy.
Mr. Buchanan discounts the threat of retaliation by other nations, and he argues -- not without some logic -- that those who run big surpluses in their trade with us have more to lose from a full-scale trade war.
However, even if other countries do not take overt hostile measures, such tariffs are likely to do more damage than good. This point has been demonstrated by a recent United States International Trade Commission study that concluded that the removal of outstanding antidumping and countervailing duty orders that were in effect in 1991 would have netted that year alone a gain to the United States economy of $1.6 billion.

HEADLINE: Beware Propaganda From Teachers' Union

 BODY:
"No Teacher Pacts in 34 Districts" [Sept. 24] was a propaganda effort, as always, by the representatives of their union, New York State United Teachers, to present a "hardship" scenario of more money and benefits. And part of the script of desperation is their coeur di crie, "We have been working without a contract," which is false.
Under the State labor law is the provision known as the Triboro Law, which insures and protects striking workers when a deadlock or an impasse occurs in negotiations, which provides that the workers will be continued under their expired contract. 
 What is particularly peculiar that at any one time the taxpayer is kept in a state of ignorance as far as negotiations and even after them. The union realizes that human memory is short, and the school board for political reasons chooses to remain silent. So within this conspiratorial vacuum, Mr. and Mrs. Taxpayer are required to continually be faced with escalating salary demands and benefits to a fair thee well.
However it is their fault, by not taking advantage of the provision provided under the Freedom of Information Law, by demanding from their district offices copies of salary schedules and contracts at either 25 cents per page or simply a request to view the information at the office, taking notes.
In the meantime there has been no teacher shortage other than in some areas of special education or English as a Second Language, thus creating a strong buyers' market for teachers, where we are at today. Moreover one must realize that for every teacher vacancy there are hundreds, if not thousands, of applications for every opening.
This is occurring against a backdrop of the 1990's downsizing and re-engineering by corporations, especially on Long Island. Ironically these displaced workers are not only technically highly qualified, but lack basic education courses to teach. But they are or were the very taxpayers that have paid high education taxes.
The New York State United Teachers and its members and representatives choose to ignore the coming economic crisis of economic downturn, due to the selective unemployment of middle- to upper-middle-management employees, together with the refusal of major utilities such as Lilco and Jamaica Water Supply of western Nassau to restrain from passing their education property taxes along to the consumers .
So the next time you see an "informational" picket line in front of your child's school challenge the teachers to explain how in giving in to their demands will you be able to maintain a home and family.

HEADLINE: THE WORLD;
The Suspense Isn't Over in Haiti

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER 

DATELINE: PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti

 BODY:
UNDER the protection of 20,000 American troops, Jean-Bertrand Aristide returned to Haiti in triumph a year ago today. Much has changed in this country since then, including the Clinton Administration's level of commitment to the beneficiary of its first successful foreign policy gamble. But one central fact remains constant: even with his term of office rapidly drawing to a close, Mr. Aristide's authority shows no sign of ebbing.
Soon, however, Mr. Aristide's countrymen will discover whether one man's magnetism and charisma are sufficient to sustain an entire nation. And that promises to make for a tense next four months. 
 In that time, Haiti is scheduled first to elect and then to swear in a successor to Mr. Aristide, who is prohibited by the Haitian Constitution from serving two consecutive terms. And barely two weeks after the Feb. 7 inauguration date of the new president, the United Nations is scheduled to withdraw the 6,900 foreign soldiers and policemen who have been the guarantors of the country's security.
Once they are removed, Haiti will again be left to defend itself.
 
Haiti's DeGaulle
 The uncertainty that situation has engendered has little to do with Mr. Aristide himself, since most Haitians assume he will be running the country for the next five years, regardless of who is sitting in the National Palace. As Lionel Delatour, a leader of a reformist business group here, puts it, "Aristide is now for Haiti what Charles de Gaulle was for the Fifth Republic in France, or what Peron was for Argentina" -- that is, a force so dominant that it scarcely matters whether he is on the throne or merely behind it.
 
America's Contribution
 Rather, it is the prospect of relying on an untested and hastily trained national police force of some 5,000 members that is particularly unnerving to Haitians, many of whom continue to hope the United Nations will have a change of heart and extend its mandate here. In contrast to operations in places like Bosnia and Somalia, the peacekeeping force here has encountered no major setbacks, but that does not mean United Nations officials are willing to stay. Instead, they appear eager not to push their luck.
The United States has also contributed to the uneasiness that now prevails here. In order to avoid difficulties with Congressional Republicans who despise Mr. Aristide, the Clinton Administration has pressed the Haitian President to fulfill his promise to leave office, rather than seek restoration of the three years of his term that he lost as a result of the military coup that overthrew him on Sept. 30, 1991. But Senator Jesse Helms is now seeking to hold up disbursement of $1.3 million in American aid intended to conduct the very election that will show Mr. Aristide to the door.
"The issue now comes down not to Haiti and its internal politics, but election-year politics in the United States," one adviser to Mr. Aristide said about the hostile Republicans and their behavior. "It seems to me counterproductive to what their claims are."
After refusing for months to state unequivocally that he will step down, Mr. Aristide finally made a pledge in language satisfactory to Washington; if he had not, Vice President Al Gore would not be coming today to take part in the anniversary celebrations. But the President has also said he will respect the will of the new Parliament, dominated by legislators eager to do his bidding, that is to be seated today. They are already being urged by graffiti in the streets to follow this course: "No negotiations: Three more years for Aristide."
 
An Important Ally
 The dangers of trying to get anything done without Mr. Aristide as an ally were illustrated last week when Prime Minister Smarck Michel, frustrated by his inability to push through an economic reform package that the President has quietly undermined, decided he could no longer function and submitted his resignation.
The next prime minister, it is safe to assume, will be much less likely to aggressively pursue policies regarded as excessively friendly to foreign interests, such as cooperation with the International Monetary Fund and the privatization of state enterprises.
If there was a way to do it, the United States and the other members of the United Nations coalition that engineered Mr. Aristide's return to office last Oct. 15 would probably prefer to see him remain in office, rather than hand over the Government to a handpicked but unknown and unproven successor.
Mr. Aristide is "the only unifying force in this entire country," a diplomat here argued. "Why do something to deliberately destabilize the situation?"
The lack of palatable alternatives to Mr. Aristide is made clear by the names that emerge most often in the mounting speculation about his successor.
Several priests and former cabinet ministers are occasionally mentioned as the possible beneficiaries of his support, which would immediately confer front-runner status upon them, but the main focus of conjecture is Mr. Aristide's loyal aide Rene Preval, a former bakery owner who is now the Government's chief of patronage and a constant source of unease among Haiti's foreign backers.
 
Lean Times
 Whoever Mr. Aristide's successor turns out to be, he or she will quickly have to learn to make do with less. After pumping $235 million in assistance into the Haitian economy this year, the Clinton Administration has reduced its aid request for 1996 by more than half, to $90 million -- and may not get even that, given the mood in Congress.
In addition, the private investments that could help fill the gap have been slow to appear. Both the Haitians in diaspora (more than one million people in the United States, Canada and France) and foreign companies have been holding back, waiting for the political situation to clarify. "The vacillation can be explained not by economic policies, but the fact of presidential elections," Cristian Ossa, the representative of the United Nations Development Program here, said. "The private sector wants more certainty."
 
Boat People, Again?
 As a result, few new jobs have been created, and popular impatience with the economic situation is growing. In a small but disturbing echo of the "boat people" crisis that spurred the American intervention, a trickle of Haitians hoping to improve their fortunes is again taking to the seas: The Bahamas recently intercepted several rickety, overcrowded freighters, and a vessel with more than 300 aboard sailed into downtown Miami early this month.
"Yes, for the moment we have security, but there is still no money," said Luckner Gerard, an unemployed construction worker here.
"And soon the foreigners will be gone. What is going to become of us then?"

HEADLINE: FAMILY VALUES;
Marching to the Beat of a Million Drummers

BYLINE: By DON TERRY 

DATELINE: CHICAGO

 BODY:
THE bandwagon for Louis Farrakhan's Million Man March in Washington tomorrow is packed with a cross section of black America, from the militant to the mild.
But where it is going and how far it will follow Mr. Farrakhan, the leader of the Nation of Islam, is much less clear and is the subject of intense debate in black barber shops, beauty parlors, corporate hallways and college campuses across the country. 
 The rally in the capital is draped in the banners of responsibility, patriarchy, God and black nationalism, leaving some to wonder whether the crowded wagon is headed for the political right. Or is it destined for a more familiar path of protest and stubborn faith in government? Will it hook its fate to the Republicans next year when the nation holds the last Presidential election of the 20th century? Or will it follow a black general to the White House?
Or perhaps its wheels will fall off after tomorrow because too many people are trying to steer.
Some black political figures have endorsed the march while distancing themselves from Mr. Farrakhan, who is the keynote speaker. Dismissing their efforts, the Rev. Benjamin F. Chavis Jr., the national director of the march, said, "The message and the messenger have transcended all divisions in the black community."
No one knows how many men will actually answer Mr. Farrakhan's call and show up tomorrow. The head of the 8.2-million member National Baptist Convention has told his followers not to attend, and so has W. Deen Mohammed, the leader of the largest group of black Muslims in the country. The National Urban League and the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People have declined participation. Gen. Colin L. Powell sent his regrets, citing his book tour.
But at least 10,000 Chicagoans plan to attend. Supporters in Washington include Mayor Marion S. Barry, Jesse Jackson and the Congressional Black Caucus but not Representative Gary A. Franks of Connecticut, a Republican and a harsh critic of Mr. Farrakhan. The Hartford City Council has designated tomorrow a holy day, enabling employees to take unpaid leave or use their vacation time. Schools in Camden, N.J., will close because so many employees are going. New York City organizers expect to fill 1,600 buses.
Mr. Farrakhan has told black women not to come. This march, he says, is the business of men. But as a concession, he has invited Maya Angelou, the poet, and Rosa Parks, the civil rights heroine, to speak.
Almost everyone, however, agrees that black people can no longer sit still. It is time to do something, almost anything.
"In the black community, there is a unified unhappiness with the state of racial progress and a wide level of unity about seeing something done," said Michael C. Dawson, an associate professor of political science at the University of Chicago. "But there is real disagreement about what should be on the black agenda."
At the rally speakers are expected to call for a voter registration drive and an end to cutbacks in education and job-training programs. Some will call for a black political convention next spring to prepare a litmus test for Presidential candidates.
"On the eve of the last Presidential race in this century, we do not intend to allow the black vote to be for sale," Mr. Chavis said. "One way to keep it from being so is to make sure we have an agenda, a national black political agenda. But if a white candidate commits to our agenda, we are going beyond skin politics."
Mr. Farrakhan describes the rally as "a holy day of atonement, reconciliation and responsibility," in which men have a chance to apologize to women and to God for not taking better care of their families. In many ways, Mr. Farrakhan is a conservative, and on the surface, at least, some of the rally's themes echo those heard at Republican gatherings: God, loyalty, family, discipline.
"I have often made the point," said Salim Muwakkil, an editor at In These Times who is a former member of the Nation of Islam, "if it were not for his expressions of anti-Semitism, Minister Farrakhan would be the candidate of the Newt Gingriches, because he is basically talking their talk. It's the same message that the church is trying to sell, but the young aren't listening to the church. They are listening to Farrakhan." Though a critic of the Nation of Islam, Mr. Muwakkil says he plans to attend the rally.
Just as some of the marchers tomorrow will embrace the message but shun the messenger, blacks who approve of the family-values themes often denounce House Speaker Newt Gingrich and the tone of his "Contract With America." Blacks make the case that their values have been as solid and traditional as those elsewhere in America.
"This whole notion that the right has a patent on family values is absolute nonsense," said Connie Tucker, director the Southern Organizing Committee for Economic and Social Justice, an Atlanta-based group involved in environmental issues in Southern black communities. "We believe a lot of our families have been destroyed by racism, and now we have to build them back up. What the far right is saying now has been discussed in our community for years, and it has nothing to do with conservative politics."
Dennis M. Walcott, president of the New York Urban League, agreed. "I don't think the march represents a rightward shift," he said. "What it represents is the true beliefs of blacks for years: self-determination, strengthening families. Minister Farrakhan is not saying anything new, and this march does not represent anything new."
But Mr. Farrakhan has added another reason for the decline of the black family: the black man. His call for black men to atone is one of the most controversial elements of the march. For some supporters and opponents of the march, it sounds a lot like blaming the victim.
"I don't support this march for a variety of reasons," said Roger Wilkins, a professor of history at George Mason University. "The first thing is, I don't think black men have to atone to the nation at large. What black men need is not atonement, they need jobs. You need jobs to make strong families."
But Conrad Muhammad, minister of the Nation of Islam's Mosque No. 7 in Harlem, said, "We never blame the victim." He added: "White America has to accept culpability for the condition of black people. But we have reached a point where as black people we don't have another moment to waste waiting for government."
Ron Walters, a professor of political science at Howard University and a march supporter, said the notion of a collective atonement has caused much discomfort. "But the main thing is people want to make a statement about the condition of the black male," he said. "The black male is the most vilified symbol of our society."
Ms. Tucker, who supports the march, voiced reservations about its philosophy of patriarchy. "My concern is that there be no implication that somehow black men are more oppressed than black women," she said. "While black men are undergoing a character assassination from external forces, black women are undergoing an assassination internally. Just listen to gangster rap."
No matter what the turnout tomorrow, Mr. Farrakhan should be smiling like a lottery winner. He has collected a jackpot of publicity, the coin of politicians as well as tabloid celebrities and demagogues.
"If the march is successful," Mr. Wilkins said, "it seems to me a lot of people who are not in the Nation of Islam and who are not nationalists will view him as somebody who has provided the black community a great service.
"I think that's bad," he said. "His attacks on Jews, whether direct or indirect, are vile. They distort our history and our struggle and who we have been as a people."
Others argue that tomorrow's rally has already grown beyond the reach of one man.
"This is not about Minister Farrakhan," Mr. Walters said. "He issued the call and started this, but it has taken on a life of its own. This could be a watershed march. It could mark the renewal of grassroots political organizing. This march belongs to the people, and they've taken it over."

NO single issue is more emblematic of America's ambivalence toward immigrants than bilingual education. And now nagging questions have recast and magnified the issue, which has even become a subject of Presidential politics.
If the debate is familiar, the context is new. Bilingual education has become a target of anti-immigration groups and others eager to have English declared the nation's official language. Like affirmative action, bilingual education has been derided by the descendants of immigrants as an entitlement, a form of preferential treatment that, because it costs more in the short term, is bought at the expense of other school services. 
 Finally, it is regarded by some critics as another example of self-perpetuating bureaucratic bloat. The Federal Government now spends an estimated $250 million a year on bilingual education in public schools. where a shorage of money has made those programs, even if they are considered desirable in principle, harder and harder to justify in practice.
 
The Push Is On
 That is clearly the case in New York City, where the incoming schools chancellor, Rudolph F. Crew, pledged last week to make bilingual education a way station rather than a terminus. As it is now, some students spend up to six years virtually isolated from English-speaking classes. That system has prompted lawsuits from parents who complain that, among other things, children with Spanish surnames who happen to test poorly are automatically relegated to bilingual classes regardless of how well they speak English.
"I think that there is a need for bilingual education, but I think the need should be as a means to an end, not an end in itself," Dr. Crew said.
Now, he said, teachers and administrators often keep students in bilingual programs longer than necessary. "They don't want to let them go into the rest of the school community for fear they will meet sudden failure," he said. "I think you are going to have to really get people to see the whole system works in service to these kids."
Budgetary pressures provide a whole new dimension to a debate that, until recently, was largely centered around two questions:
Is it better to immerse students in English, even if at first they may not understand the instruction, or to teach them English over several years while educating them in other subjects in their native language?
And even if bilingual programs are better, why should the 1 in 20 public school students in the nation who can't speak English be taught in their own language today when the immigrant children who entered school speaking only Italian or Russian or Yiddish or German or Greek or Finnish a century ago managed to get along just fine?
Today, those questions seem to have been overtaken by concerns about whether bilingual programs yield the returns that would justify their cost. A backlash against entitlements and preferential programs has been aggravated as art, music, sports and other school activities have been decimated.
At the same time, enrollment in many districts is increasing -- in New York City, at the rate of 20,000 students a year, many of them immigrants. And that puts even more pressure on school spending. Out of a total budget of $8 billion, the Board of Education spends $300 million a year on bilingual programs.
At the beginning of this century, when foreign-born people constituted nearly twice the proportion of the population that they do today, immigrants' assimilation by learning English was taken for granted. But for those who could not learn the language, there were plenty of factory jobs available to dropouts. Today, even the most menial service jobs demand some ability to speak and read English (which may explain why, by some reports, more of today's immigrants earn less for longer periods than their counterparts did a century ago).
Still, bilingual education has received decidedly mixed reviews since it was first upheld by the United States Supreme Court in 1973 -- in a case involving Chinese children in San Francisco.
Some educators say the best bilingual programs speed immigrants into all-English classes at their normal grade level after two or three years. But some parents complain that students are left to languish in bilingual programs well beyond the three to five years in which they are expected -- or required -- to move into the academic mainstream.
All sides in the debate agree that bilingual education has fallen woefully short of its promise. Supporters say it never has been given a chance. They say that bilingual programs have too often been underfinanced, grudgingly put in place by school systems that never devised challenging curriculums, and taught by teachers who were not well trained in bilingual education.
Now, some colleges are preparing bilingual teachers better. Also, many states are letting school systems certify educated immigrant parents as teachers after short training sessions. Many cities, including San Francisco and, more recently, New York, have established "newcomer schools," where the entire student body is foreign-born and the courses are taught by teachers fluent in an array of languages. (In New York, students also learn in Spanish, Chinese, Russian, Korean, Polish and French, to name a few.)
 
Next, College
 Some bilingual programs do seem to work. Fully half of the 7,100 students in the Calexico Unified School District, in California near the Arizona state line and the Mexican border, are enrolled in bilingual classes. Most of the students are poor. But the district graduates nearly 90 percent of its high school students and sends nearly as many to four-year colleges. Calexico's curriculums for Spanish-speaking students and for English speakers are the same. The Spanish speakers move first into "sheltered English" classes conducted in both languages and then, typically within three to four years, transfer to all-English classes where they manage to perform at the same grade level as their English-speaking classmates.
"It can be done," says Emily J. Palacio, Calexico's assistant superintendent of instructional services. "But many school districts have viewed bilingual education as a compliance program and not an education program."
Still, at a time when school budgets are tight and when many Americans see immigrants as competition for employment rather than as potential assets in an increasingly global economy, the debate over bilingual education is not just academic.
"Do immigrants deserve special services? Yes," says Sanford J. Ungar, an American University professor and author of "Fresh Blood: The New American Immigrant."
"Will they get them? No. Not in this political climate."

HEADLINE: THE NATION;
A Tale of Two Republican Mayors

BYLINE: By STEVEN LEE MYERS 

 BODY:
THEY vaulted into office as outsiders spouting reform slogans and pledging to upset the liberal apple cart that has been big-city politics for most of this century. The very thought, at the time, seemed downright revolutionary: the Mayors of the nation's two largest cities, overwhelmingly Democratic cities to boot, were Republicans.
Mayor Richard J. Riordan of Los Angeles and Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani of New York, taking office in July 1993 and January 1994, set out to prove that their blend of law and order, fiscal conservativism and moderation on social issues was just what their cities wanted. And for a time, the Mayors became poster boys for a party eager to sell itself in the nation's cities as well as the suburbs. 
 So far, it hasn't quite worked out that way.
Each has pursued his campaign agenda, but with different results and by starkly different means. Their political styles reflect not only their distinct personas but the personality of their cities, which, in Mr. Giuliani's case, may, at times, have worked to his advantage.
With the bombast and, critics say, sneering bluster of the prosecutor he once was, Mr. Giuliani has shaken New York's municipal bureaucracy, slashing the payroll by attrition and buyouts and bashing almost anyone he perceives as part of the Democratic status quo. Nowhere was his style of contrived chaos, then compromise, more pronounced than in his epic battle with the Board of Education. He hounded out one schools chancellor, forced the board to reverse itself and reject its choice of a successor, struck a bizarre alliance with the Brooklyn Democratic organization to endorse someone else and finally settled last week on a man he had never met and who only vaguely embraced the Mayor's original conditions for support.
Mr. Riordan, acting more like the businessman he was, has taken a more conciliatory approach toward the same goals.
Both have also had to accommodate some of the very forces -- most of them Democratic -- that they had railed against as candidates. In New York, those compromises sometimes seem to have been obscured by Mr. Giuliani's muscular oratory, which reflects not only his personality and professional experience but, perhaps, the temperament of his city (although one of Mr. Riordan's predecessors, the combative Sam Yorty, may have seemed just as uncharacteristic of Los Angeles as the taciturn David N. Dinkins, whom Mr. Giuliani defeated, was of New York).
 
The Second Half
 Now, with Mr. Riordan past the midpoint of his tenure and Mr. Giuliani nearing his, they have found themselves in an uncomfortable middle, sounding neither terribly Republican nor very Democratic -- with their popularity slipping. If independence has become a political virtue, the flip side is that the Mayors have alienated both sides.
And the pressure is likely to increase. Their cities are almost certain to suffer deep cuts in Federal aid at the hands of Republicans in Congress. That's not likely to sit well with pivotal Democratic voters.
"They've at least established that it's possible to be elected as a Republican in overwhelmingly Democratic city," said Jay Severin, a Republican campaign strategist based in New York. "The real acid test is whether they can be re-elected."
Despite the stylistic differences, the parallels between these two Mayors are striking. Their elections, although by narrow margins, seemed to signal a willingness of weary voters to take a chance on men who had never before held elective office. They both replaced black mayors, prevailing in campaigns that underscored deep racial and economic divisions. They cast themselves as conservative on crime and government bureaucracy, while moderate on social issues like abortion and gay rights.
In the nonpartisan elections in Los Angeles, Mr. Riordan made less of his party affiliation than of his business background. Mr. Giuliani ran as a non-Democrat and would have lost without the votes he also received as the candidate of the maverick Liberal Party. Once in City Hall, they both balanced budgets, trimmed taxes, imposed managerial discipline and invested new resources in police departments -- in turn, claiming some of the credit for significant declines in reported crime.
"The message that came out of both elections was a desire for a more efficient urban government, urban government that would be socially and fiscally responsible, urban government that made public safety its priority," Mr. Giuliani's chief of staff, Randy Mastro, said. "I think both of these Mayors have focused the debate on these issues."
But they have also done things that, whether for pragmatism or politics or both, have defied the very expectations they set. Both have backed off from the wholesale shift of municipal services to private companies -- in part because of the opposition of municipal unions. Mr. Giuliani has even forged a tacit alliance with New York's unions that, to his critics, has undermined his pledges to extract specific productivity improvements and other concessions (although some critics acknowledge that he is only now undergoing his first real test in current bargaining).
"When you play to the organized labor movement, as he has, you're back in the old saddle again, just like mayors have done for years," said Ester R. Fuchs, a professor at Barnard College and a Dinkins adviser.
Nonetheless, these two Mayors have scored best with wary Democrats when they defied their own party. To the dismay of Republicans, they both rallied behind President Clinton on gun control and the crime bill. And they both crossed party lines to endorse Democrats for statewide office: Mr. Riordan for Senator Diane Feinstein and Mr. Giuliani for Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, the embodiment of Democratic liberalism.
Mr. Riordan's gamble paid off; at least Ms. Feinstein won. Mr. Giuliani's did not. The endorsement catapulted his approval ratings for a while, but he is still regarded as a traitor by supporters of the new Republican Governor, George E. Pataki.
"Orthodoxy," Mr. Severin said, "is a luxury that a big-city Republican cannot easily afford. Their brand of Republicanism is accommodation."
Both Mayors also have had to balance the promise of change they offered core supporters with the wariness of Democrats who consider the Republican Contract With America a threat to America's cities.
 
In Name Only
 Mr. Riordan ducked the debate in California last year over Proposition 187, which would limit government benefits for immigrants, but ordered a review of the city's affirmative action policies. Mr. Giuliani has railed against Republican efforts to restrict immigration, but has remained unusually muted on proposed Federal cuts in Medicaid and welfare.
Their critiques have not always sat well with fellow Republicans. For a time, Mr. Riordan was greeted by party colleagues wearing pins that read, "RINO," for Republican in Name Only. And after the Cuomo endorsment, angry Republicans suggested that Mr. Giuliani drop the facade and change parties, which is what the city's last Republican Mayor, John V. Lindsay, did.
Now they stand at a crossroads, embraced wholeheartedly by neither side. "This is why it's particularly difficult these days to be a Republican mayor," Mr. Shonenshein said, "and why mayors never rise to higher office."

HEADLINE: THE NATION;
Chicago's Scholarly Whirlwinds Reap Nobels

BYLINE: By PETER PASSELL 

 BODY:
FOR Robert E. Lucas Jr., winning the Nobel Prize in economics last week was, no doubt, the occasion of a lifetime. For his employer, though, it was business as usual: Economists from the University of Chicago have brought home Nobels in five of the last six years, and eight of the 22 economics prizes ever awarded to Americans.
Could it be something in the water? 
 No, but something does make Chicago a special place for economics. The weather certainly helps to concentrate the mind: economists who would as soon be bird-watching or playing tennis go elsewhere. And the university's talent for self-promotion probably makes a difference: "Nobel prizes require lobbying," explained an economist from another school who preferred to remain anonymous lest he be looked on with less favor by the Swedish Royal Academy Sciences, "and nobody lobbies better than Chicago."
But at the core, the economics is unusual at Chicago because it is pursued with a zeal derived from a sense that it's us versus them. "Chicago has a sort of bunker mentality," suggests Orley Ashenfelter, an economist at Princeton, a feeling of common purpose that nurtures hard work and unconventional thinking.
Claudia Goldin, a Chicago Ph.D. who now teaches at Harvard, offers a cheerier variation on the same theme. Walking the halls of the economics department, she recalls, you always had the sense that heavy-duty problems were on the verge of being solved, "that social science was as important as medical science."
 
Rattling Cages
 The guiding spirit behind all this, it is widely agreed, was Milton Friedman, whose larger-than-life presence dominated the department for nearly half a century. Mr. Friedman, now in semi-retirement at the Hoover Institution in California, is best known for his anti-statist views on subjects ranging from monetary policy to public education. And that goes a long way toward explaining why Chicago economics is synonymous in the public mind with conservative economics.
But in fact Mr. Friedman's primary impact was to give the department a unique identity as the gadfly and permanent outsider, the place where free thinkers would not be cowed by convention. In contrast to the other schools which painted economics in fuzzy grays, Chicago economics was "dominated by a clear vision," explains Ms. Goldin, "a simple and elegant" set of ideas about how markets worked. Those ideas provided a lens for seeing the world differently and a sense of moral purpose in challenging received wisdom.
Mr. Lucas' prize, for example, is largely based on the "Lucas critique," which aims for the jugular of Keynesian economics, arguing that people learn to anticipate government efforts to manipulate the economy and change their plans accordingly, often canceling out or reversing the desired effects. Robert Fogel, who won the prize in 1993, divided American economic historians into warring factions by claiming that most slave owners did not act brutishly because they did not wish to damage their property, and that the system of slavery may have been compatible with modern capitalism. Gary Becker, the Nobel winner in 1992, outraged traditional social scientists by using mechanistic economic models to explain why people had babies, why they took drugs, even why they divorced.
For all their focused and strongly held convictions, though, Mr. Friedman and his disciples also encouraged open, very competitive give and take. "Most economics departments are like country clubs," allows James Heckman, a faculty member who earned his Ph.D. from Princeton. "At Chicago everyone speaks bluntly, and you are only considered as good as your last paper."
 
Straddling Disciplines
 At other universities, economists often feign interest in interdisciplinary research. At Chicago they really are interested, in no small part because most are convinced that a handful of principles explain much of the way the world works. Ronald Coase, who is affiliated with the law school, won the Nobel Prize in economics in 1991 for using a disarmingly simple theorem of economics to analyze the common law.
All of Chicago's economics prizes have been for work done in the 1970's or long before. And not every sign suggests that its Nobel cup will continue to run over. In the past most of the faculty was trained at Chicago, coming back, perhaps, after a few years' seasoning at farm teams in Los Angeles, Minneapolis or Pittsburgh. But in the last decade, the city of Chicago's grim reputation and the department's free-wheeling, take-no-prisoners style seems to have repelled the very best and brightest.
 
Bring to a Boil
 Still, Mr. Heckman is fairly confident that the department can stay on top. "The intensity of the place drives away good faculty and students who can't stand the heat," he concedes, but those who stay "do some good cooking."
And while the university really doesn't put anything in the water, the department does offer some of the advantages of a fountain of youth. "Living, breathing and sleeping economics," claims Mr. Heckman, "adds 10 to 15 years to your intellectual life."

HEADLINE: Small Blast Damages a Detector Serving La Guardia Airport

BYLINE: By DENNIS HEVESI 

 BODY:
A small explosive blew out part of the wind-shear detection system serving La Guardia Airport on Friday afternoon, officials said, causing no air-traffic control problems but raising concerns about who might have set off the device and why.
A one-page handwritten note found at the site linked the incident to the Federal raid on the Branch Davidian compound outside Waco, Tex., in February 1993. "This is in response to the Waco incident, for all our fallen brothers," the note read. It also carried a scrawled swastika. 
 The Federal Bureau of Investigation said it was unclear whether the attack was simply vandalism, the work of copycats mimicking the attack on an Amtrak train in Arizona last week or an act of terrorism by a well-trained and highly organized group.
The equipment destroyed -- a 2-foot-by-18-inch metal box filled with electronics and attached at the base of a 40-foot wooden pole -- had been burned twice before in 1994, but no note had been left on either of those occasions, the police said.
Officers were classifying the explosion as a crime of criminal mischief. Deputy Inspector Robert Martin, head of the Police Department's special investigations division, said he was not ruling out an act of vandalism in which "someone, in the spirit of the times didn't say, 'Let's leave a note.' "
But noting the extra security precautions that would be taken next weekend, when dignitaries from all over the world are to arrive in New York City for the start of a three-day celebration of the 50th anniversary of the United Nations, he added, "We're giving it some significance because of the timing with the anniversary of the U.N. and, of course, other terrorist acts. We are thinking that this is serious."
Joseph Valiquette, a spokesman for the F.B.I. in New York City, said, "We are going to take it seriously until we know that we should not take it seriously."
If the Waco note is authentic, it would be the first time in recent memory that New York City was the victim of an attack by a white supremacist group. In the past, terrorist attacks have come from anarchists, Puerto Rican nationalists, war protesters, black-power groups and, more recently, Middle Eastern terrorists hoping to change United States foreign policy.
Neither the police nor the F.B.I. would say what kind of explosive was used in the blast, but Deputy Inspector Martin ruled out dynamite, saying, "If it had been dynamite, there would have been a big explosion."
The damage at the airport was limited to the charring of the metal box and the destruction of its contents; the pole that the box was attached to was not even toppled.
The explosion occurred at 4 P.M. on Friday at the old Flushing Airport across the bay from La Guardia, the police said. A police spokeswoman, Officer Kathleen Kelly, said someone had cut through a fence on the grounds of the old airport and attached "an improvised explosive device" next to what is called a low-level wind-shear alert system remote center.
The center is one of six that measure wind speed and direction and then send that information to a central computer at La Guardia.
Aviation experts said yesterday that the F.A.A. often chooses not to protect such unmanned equipment because it is not a big security risk. They likened the equipment to an individual traffic light -- helpful but dispensable, at least for short periods.
Officials at the airport said the explosion never jeopardized air traffic. The entire wind-shear detection system was up and operating by yesterday morning.
F.B.I. agents and members of the New York City Police Department's terrorism task force were at the site yesterday, inside a fenced-in area of the old airport, which is northwest of the Van Wyck Expressway near Linden Place and 28th Avenue in College Point.
The neighborhood is largely an isolated, marshy industrial tract, near the College Point Industrial Park and the depot for the Queens Surface Bus Company. At the gate through the chain-link fence to the airport, there are five concrete highway barriers, one of which is askew to allow vehicles to pass.
About 150 yards inside the gate stands the 40-foot-high wooden pole that held the damaged wind-shear equipment. The pole is enclosed by fence that is six feet high, five feet square and topped by razor wire.
Wind-measuring devices are attached at the top of the pole, and the box that was burned was connected at the base.
"It's not your usual telephone pole," Deputy Inspector Martin said. "It's possible it looked like something sophisticated to them."
Anthony Willett, a spokesman for the Federal Aviation Administration, said that his agency discovered the destruction immediately, and that the F.B.I. had been called in soon afterward, "as is standard procedure when a Federal facility is involved."
Yesterday morning, a man driving a private security company vehicle, who did not want to be identified, drove up to the gate and said that residents and business people in the area had often complained that security at the site was lax. He said teen-agers frequently entered the area.
The 70-acre Flushing Airport, which the city bought in 1955, was closed in 1984 because its runways frequently flooded. But the most recent attempts to revive it for aviation use ended two years ago when the city backed off a plan to convert it to a heliport.
In making the decision, the city's Economic Development Corporation cited concerns over the noise a heliport would create in surrounding neighborhoods and concluded that the small 1920's airfield was no longer suited to be an aviation hub.

HEADLINE: Drop in U.S. Social-Health Index Is Reported

 BODY:
An index devised by a group of social scientists at Fordham University reports that six social ills, including child abuse and the gap between rich and poor, are at their worst recorded levels and have dragged the nation's well-being to its fourth-lowest point in 24 years.
The researchers also tracked their social well-being index against the gross domestic product, the output of all goods and services within the country's borders, and concluded that the nation's economic prosperity and its social health, as measured by the index, are no longer linked. 
 The report, "The Index of Social Health," looks at Federal Government statistics on 16 different social problems, comparing each annual measure with the year in which it was at its best level. It then derives an index figure on a scale of 0 to 100, with 100 the best score.
The report was first produced in 1985 with statistics dating back to 1970. The nation's best year, as measured in the report, was 1973, when the index stood at 77.5. Its worst year was 1991, when the index was 38.1. In 1993, the year covered by this year's report, the index was 40.6, down from 42.5 in 1992.
"This is the first time that six problems have hit their lowest in one year," said Dr. Marc L. Miringoff, the study's author and director of the Fordham University Institute for Innovation in Social Policy in Tarrytown, N.Y. "And these problems cut across the age and income span."
In addition to the gap between rich and poor, and child abuse, problems measured at their index lows were: the number of poor children, the number of uninsured, average weekly earnings and the amount the elderly are paying for health care, Dr. Miringoff said. In two other categories, drug abuse and homicides, the index also showed drops from 1993.
In a related study, Dr. Miringoff extended his social research in nine categories back to 1959 and compared these with the gross domestic product. He found that until about 1975, the social health of the nation had risen with its overall wealth, but that since then, wealth has increased while social health, as measured by the index, has fallen.
"We cannot count any longer on having economic growth produce an improvement in some of the basic human problems we all face," Dr. Miringoff said.
He said he was surprised by the difference between the changes in the G.D.P. and in his index. While the G.D.P. has steadily risen, he said, the index has fallen.
Six of the categories used to calculate the social index did improve in 1993: infant mortality, food stamp coverage, the teen-age suicide rate, unemployment, poverty among the elderly and access to affordable housing. But these improvements were not sufficient to bring up the index. Two other categories, deaths from drunken driving and the high-school drop-out rate, remained about the same.
"All of this tells us a great deal about why people are upset," Dr. Miringoff said. "Behind these numbers there's a lot of insecurity, a lot of frustration."

HEADLINE: Santa Barbara Journal;
Big-City Problems Hit Close to Home

BYLINE: New York Times Regional Newspapers 

DATELINE: SANTA BARBARA, Calif., Oct. 14

 BODY:
Stretched between the Santa Ynez Mountains and the Pacific Ocean, this city of 90,000 people has long had a benign reputation as a refuge from the mayhem of Los Angeles, 90 miles south. Even Marcia Clark came here to escape the stresses of prosecuting O. J. Simpson.
But these days, Santa Barbara, colonized by Spanish missionaries in the 18th century, is beginning to show big-city growing pains not unlike those in Los Angeles. 
 Gang violence was unheard of here just five years ago. But now about once a week a gang problem erupts in some area of the city, the police say. Meanwhile, with a sluggish economy, several major high-technology employers have left the city. And although Santa Barbara has long had Hispanic residents, in the past 10 years their numbers have increased, as have the tensions between white and Hispanic residents, particularly in the public schools.
With the approach of the Nov. 7 election, in which 17 candidates are to compete for 4 of 7 seats on the City Council, solving these problems has taken on a new urgency. Civic soul-searching is under way, particularly over how to rejuvenate the economy and cope with the alarming increase in gang activity.
The police say more and more youth gangs have been traveling here on weekend nights from the southern cities of Oxnard and Ventura. Even more distressing, they say, Santa Barbara teen-agers are forming their own gangs on city streets that wind between adobe and red-tile-roofed buildings, some of which date to Spanish rule.
Compared with Los Angeles, the gang problem here is slight. "In our community, it's still manageable," said Lieut. John Thayer, spokesman for the Santa Barbara Police Department. Santa Barbara averages between four and five homicides a year, including those from gang warfare, while on one weekend in August this year, 29 people were shot dead in Los Angeles County as a result of gang violence alone.
But Santa Barbara police are still concerned. Earlier this year, the police department won a $1.5 million Federal grant to pay for educational programs in the high schools and to train officers in anti-gang work, as well as to hire more prosecutors.
While officials develop programs to combat crime, they are faced with another looming problem -- the exodus of technology jobs and the devastating effect on the local economy. For example, in a particularly painful week late last year, a combined 620 layoffs and job transfers were announced by Raytheon Corporation's Electromagnetic Systems Division, which makes hardware for the military, and by the Hughes Corporation's Santa Barbara Research Center, which does work for NASA and commercial space ventures.
Although the majority of Santa Barbara is white, nearly 32 percent is made up of Hispanic residents. The Hispanic population has increased 10 percent since 1980, according to the 1990 census, and with this growth has come increased tensions between different cultures.
In the public schools, for example, a debate has developed over a high school textbook, "The Mexican-American Heritage" by Carlos M. Jimenez, a Los Angeles teacher. The book includes a map showing land once claimed by Mexico that is now part of the United States, including California and parts of six other states in the Southwest. The area is described as Aztlan, the Aztec's mythic homeland.
Sandee Beckers, a school board member, says the book is trying to incite a Hispanic uprising. Deborah Sutherland, a supporter of Ms. Beckers, said in an interview, "The book consistently questions the validity of our existing border with Mexico."
But Grace Florez, the only Hispanic school board member, said in an interview, "It's not written from a Eurocentric perspective, so for all of us that grew up here, it's not a standard history book." And four local principals support the textbook, which continues to be used in the schools.
Still, Santa Barbara's problems, at least at this stage, pale against those of Los Angeles. And city leaders say an even-keeled community temperament and ethnically diverse history make Santa Barbara well equipped to solve its problems.
"I know there are certainly tensions and problems, but Santa Barbara as a community really seems to be together in trying to solve them," said Mike Caston, the superintendent of the Santa Barbara schools who worked for 23 years in the Los Angeles public school system before arriving here last year.
"Santa Barbara's a community that has a long tradition and has always had a large minority population," Mr. Caston said. "Look at community organizations, and there are minorities on advisory boards and in top jobs, in politics and in business."
Mayor Harriet Miller said: "We have a community that's very concerned about the future. There isn't that kind of neighborhood pride in big cities. It doesn't seem to exist in L.A."
Indeed, Los Angelenos continue to escape to Santa Barbara's relative calm. Los Angeles's District Attorney, Gil Garcetti, like his employee, Ms. Clark, recently came here for a political fund-raising event and some moments of peace from the Simpson matter.
"It's not Los Angeles," said Lynn Baragona, explaining why Ms. Clark, her best friend, often visits. "It's a lot less hectic. And everybody here is just a lot nicer."

HEADLINE: Proposed Cuts in Indian Programs Hit Those Who Rely Most on Federal Aid

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE 

DATELINE: PINE RIDGE, S.D.

 BODY:
With a gray autumn sky clamped like a steel colander over this bleak prairie reservation, Maxine Running Hawk recently talked about how she would keep her 10 children warm in their Government-supplied house this winter, by plugging wall holes with rags and by running the oven with the door off its hinges.
"We hoped to get the repairs done by winter," the 33-year-old Oglala Sioux told Bill Quijas, a visitor from the Tribal Housing Authority. "We can see light through the door. It gets cold in here." 
 But the solemn, pony-tailed housing official was not visiting to offer good cheer. Because of Government action in faraway Washington, renovation of Mrs. Running Hawk's two-bedroom cottage has now been postponed, to next spring, maybe.
Across the remote, far-flung archipelago of American tribal reservations, word is filtering back from the nation's capital that the Republican-controlled Congress has made the deepest cuts in memory in programs that support the ethnic group that is probably the most dependent on Federal aid: the nation's two million Indians.
The bill passed by Congress calls for a 10 percent cut in the budget of the Bureau of Indian Affairs, or $168 million, from last year's total of $1.7 billion. When adjusted for inflation and for Indian population growth, the per capita cut is more than 15 percent, Indian leaders say. President Clinton has said he would veto the legislation.
But cuts in welfare, food stamps and Federal housing subsidies are threatening like the wolf packs that snapped at the buffalo herds that once provided food and clothing for Great Plains tribes like the Oglala Sioux.
According to the 1990 census, 31 percent of Indians earned incomes below the poverty line -- the largest percentage of the nation's five racial groups. Here in Shannon County, which the Census Bureau ranks as the poorest in the nation, the Federal Government is the main support for a tribe suffering from 75 percent unemployment.
"Indians are the most vulnerable group in our society, and also the weakest in terms of political power," Ada E. Deer, the Interior Department's Assistant Secretary of Indian Affairs, said of a group that historically votes Democratic. "Congress found $8 billion to give to a Defense Department that did not even request it, but could find no money to provide an adequate elementary and secondary education for Indian children."
Trying to exploit the one bright spot in the economy of Indian country, Congress also wants to impose a 35 percent tax on casino gambling on Indian reservations. Indians object, saying that tribes cannot be taxed because they are sovereign entities, similar to states.
"Congress didn't want any input from us," Wilbur Between Lodges, president of the Oglala, said after coming home empty-handed in late September from a visit to Washington with other Indian leaders. "We are just here waiting to hear what is going to happen."
Noting that Congress recently passed bills favoring ranchers and mining companies, some Indian leaders say that this fall's legislative action is only the latest chapter in a familiar, 150-year record of Congress's favoring cowboys and miners over Indians.
Others acidly note that the Bureau of Indian Affairs received the largest cuts within the Interior Department, an agency that also includes the National Park Service and the United States Geological Survey.
"Rocks and parks are taking precedence over people," Albert Hale, president of the Navajo Nation, the largest Indian tribe, said recently.
Across the West, in private conversations and public forums, the cuts are provoking bitter debate.
Supporters of current policy say the cuts violate century-old guarantees and are too great, and too swift, for the tribes to absorb. Some critics of subsidies counter that Indians have depended too long on Government aid and that the Government should be promoting self-reliance.
But some Congressional moves would cut programs designed to stimulate economic self-sufficiency for tribes. Congress's budget virtually eliminates the Indian Bureau's economic development program.
In recent years, Indian artwork has mushroomed into a $500 million-a-year industry. But Congress has just passed a measure to halve the budget for the Institute of American Indian Arts in Santa Fe. Reduced to operating with $5 million, the school is cutting its enrollment to 178, from 250.
The proposed gambling tax would hit heavily the Indian gaming industry, which has created about 300,000 jobs nationwide, largely for Indians.
In a surreal scene here, miles of monotonous prairie are broken at this reservation's western edge by blue neon and flashing gold lights, drawing attention to a makeshift casino fashioned out of two double trailers hitched together.
"We employ 120 people, and a lot of them are off the welfare rolls," Wayne Barber, the manager, an Oglala Sioux, said as Nebraska farm couples huddled over poker tables and ringing slot machines. "You have to walk before you run. This could support a hotel, an R.V. park, a golf course."
As most Indian casinos, the Oglala's shares part of its profits with members of the tribe. But the casino is a rare example of private enterprise on the reservation. A century of Federal and missionary education has failed to teach business skills to many Oglala.
Starting with an 1868 treaty that stipulated rations of beef and "good substantial woolen clothing," the Federal Government long ago replaced the buffalo as the primary source of sustenance for the Oglala. Albeit precarious, this safety net has allowed the tribe's population to roughly double in this century, hitting 24,000 today.
The Federal Government is responsible for most of the Tribal Government budget, for the entire Bureau of Indian Affairs budget, for all schools except for one missionary school on the Oglala reservation and for the entire Indian Health Service budget.
"The biggest employers here are the Federal agencies," said Delbert Brewer, an Oglala who is superintendent of the local office of the Bureau of Indian Affairs. "The reservation is 90 percent dependent on the Federal Government -- and if that dries up, we are dead as a nation."
Countering accusations of inefficiency that are often leveled at the bureau, Mr. Brewer said that over the last two years he had reduced his staff to 79 from 120. With one-third fewer employees, he administers 25 programs in a reservation the size of Connecticut.
On this 5,000-square-mile reservation, the largest in South Dakota, the bureau maintains roads, runs schools, oversees all real estate transactions, enforces soil conservation practices, administers programs run under contract by the Tribal Government and pays out $2 million a year in welfare checks.
Next door to the bureau, at the Tribal Government building, Mr. Between Lodges said, "Given the past history of the state working with us, we want to be given a chance to run our own welfare system."
In the halls of the red brick tribal building, the nervous talk is of cuts. About one-third of the tribal police force of 90 officers is expected to be laid off this month. The number of scholarships to the tribe's new four-year community college could be cut in half this year, to 115.
Down the street, stands a federally financed showcase: the bureau's new Jim Thorpe High School. But inside, the principal said he was battling to retain students after losing 40 percent of his teaching positions over the last two years.
"I'm teaching a freshman world history class with 40 kids," said the principal, Gerald A. Ray. The school dropout rate is 60 percent.
Although the bureau is required to finance tribal schools at the same per-student average as the states they are in, Congress approved separate, and unequal, education levels. In a financing pattern that is similar for most Indian education, Congressional financing allows the bureau to spend $2,900 on each high school student here, while South Dakota spends an average of $3,350 for each student in public schools outside reservations.
At the other end of Pine Ridge's rundown main street, at the Tribal Housing Authority, officials are recalculating their budgets to account for a $2 million, or 19 percent, cut in their budget. Most of the reservation's 1,100 public housing units were built in the Great Society era of the 1960's.
Although Oglala poverty has changed little in 30 years, Congress has little interest in Great Society legacies like the Old Crazy Horse Cluster, the crumbling subdivision where Mrs. Running Hawk braces for another South Dakota winter. After the last round of cuts, the authority's annual repair budget amounts to $100 a house.

HEADLINE: Emerging Role For the C.I.A.: Economic Spy

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER and TIM WEINER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 14

 BODY:
During the Clinton Administration's tense negotiations with Japan last spring -- with the looming threat of sanctions to cut off Japanese luxury car imports to the United States -- American trade officials were accompanied everywhere by a small team of intelligence officers.
Each morning, they gave Mickey Kantor, the United States trade representative, and his aides inside information gathered by the Central Intelligence Agency's Tokyo station and the electronic eavesdropping equipment of the National Security Agency, sifted by C.I.A. analysts in Washington. 
 Mr. Kantor received descriptions of conversations among Japanese bureaucrats and auto executives from Toyota and Nissan who were pressing for a settlement, and read about the competing pressures on Japan's Trade Minister, Ryutaro Hashimoto.
When the negotiations came to a climax in Geneva, the intelligence team was in place at the Intercontinental Hotel, working alongside Mr. Kantor's negotiators, offering assessments of how far the Japanese side could be pressed.
"It was a remarkable performance, because the intelligence agencies finally realized this was the World Series -- the arms control talks of the new age," said one senior Administration official.
"But in the end, did it help much? Beyond some valuable detail we could not have gotten elsewhere, did it tell us much about which way Hashimoto would go? It would be hard to make that case."
Spying on allies for economic advantage is a crucial new assignment for the C.I.A. now that American foreign policy is focused on commercial interests abroad. President Clinton made economic intelligence a high priority of his Administration, specifically information to protect and defend American competitiveness, technology and financial security in a world where an economic crisis can spread across global markets in minutes.
But the transition is a rough one for an agency far less comfortable with capital flows than with Communist foes.
At the Treasury Department, the trade representative's office and the Commerce Department, officials say they now receive a torrent of information from the C.I.A. But in the next breath, they say the quantity is not matched by the quality.
The agency, they complain, often cannot separate the vital from the trivial, and its analysis of economic data is still amateurish. Recently some in the Administration have begun to wonder aloud whether much of the analysis should be farmed out to better-trained experts in Government and the private sector.
The C.I.A. tends "too often to reproduce mainstream, middle-of-the-road views," Deputy Treasury Secretary Lawrence H. Summers told Congress last month. He questioned whether it "can add much value" to the financial information and analysis the private sector produces from a wealth of public information.
With an increasing fraction of the $28 billion intelligence budget going to economic matters, the answer to that question may be crucial to the C.I.A.'s future.
At the agency, economics is still more a buzzword than a mission. The new director, John M. Deutch, talks about it often. But in a recent interview, one of the highest-ranking officials of the C.I.A. confessed complete ignorance of the subject. Some inside the agency ridicule the idea that car exports and exchange rates -- which they call "soft stuff" -- are remotely as important as the spread of nuclear weapons and terrorism -- "hard stuff."
Moreover, a generation of American spies trained to steal secrets from Communist enemies is having trouble adjusting to the more subtle world of trade politics. There, economic competitors are also political allies, and a far wider range of players -- industrialists, bankers, and politicians worried about jobs back home -- want their say. Even many who believe in economic spying are asking if the information gained is worth risking some of America's most important alliances.
 
Negotiating
New Territory: C.I.A. at GATT
 In 1993, the Administration asked the C.I.A. for dramatic improvement in three areas where it had previously played only a bit role: supporting trade negotiations, tracking legal and illegal tactics other countries use to win business and spotting financial troubles that can become foreign policy crises, as happened in Mexico last year.
One of the C.I.A.'s first explorations into the new territory came during the 1993 negotiations over the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. It provided accounts of discussions among key countries negotiating the worldwide trade accord, focusing on the thinking of the French President at the time, Francois Mitterrand; the French Prime Minister, Edouard Balladur, and the head of the European Commission, Jacques Delors.
But in the end, the agency displayed more energy than results, Administration officials say.
"We discovered this doesn't come to them naturally, like an arms-control negotiation," said one senior official who got C.I.A. reports. "Give them very specific direction on a limited basis, with a limited time and scope, where they can give you information that they have gathered electronically, and it's pretty helpful. But the minute that you rely on their political or economic assessments -- well, let me be delicate: their capabilities are limited."
Another top American official was more direct: "The important stuff is garbled. And most of what you get is garbage."
By most accounts, the agency did better in this year's high-stakes negotiations with Japan, where a key question was what the Japanese auto industry was telling -- and was being told -- by the Japanese Government. Partly prompted by intelligence reports, the Americans told the Japanese automakers that negotiators from Japan's Ministry of International Trade and Industry were misrepresenting American demands.
American negotiators also asked for details of internal discussions between the ministry and rival agencies. Thanks to Tokyo's own internecine rivalries, the C.I.A. got a break.
Most of the secure telephones in the Japanese Government are controlled by the Foreign Ministry. But officials at the trade ministry shunned those phones, both to keep their own diplomats from listening in and because Mr. Hashimoto's chief rival for the prime ministership at the time was the Foreign Minister.
In the end, intelligence proved of limited use in predicting how far Mr. Hashimoto would go. Critics of the unspectacular accord, which chipped away at market barriers without removing them, question whether the result justified the effort. But a senior Administration economic official said the political prominence of the car talks sent an important message to the C.I.A.: focus more energy on economic security.
"We can't go into this kind of thing disarmed," one top official said. Mr. Deutch knows that, the official said: "The question is whether he will have the time to change the culture of the agency."
 
Analysis
On the Big Picture, A Fuzzy Vision
 Government officials who rely on the C.I.A. for economic intelligence say it has failed at the second major task: warning Government officials about imminent changes in other nations' fiscal policies or looming financial debacles.
"The agency is accustomed to a world where it has a monopoly on information," said one senior official who receives daily C.I.A. reports. "If you are interested in Iraq's nuclear weapons program, you don't have many other choices for your information. But if you want to know what the Bundesbank is going to do next, or whether Brazil is thinking of devaluing its currency, there is a lot of competition. And it is hard for the agency to add value."
Many Administration officials suggest that the agency simply does not have the talent for such analysis. "The best graduate students don't go there, and who can blame them?" said one of the Administration's top economic officials. "And yet, when you sit in a meeting, the views of the C.I.A. are often given more weight than the Council of Economic Advisors. Go figure."
Tracking global capital flows or predicting currency crises is beyond the agency's ability, said Allan E. Goodman, a former C.I.A. official and academic dean of Georgetown University's School of Foreign Service.
"We don't have the sources, we don't have the expertise," he said. "To develop an understanding of the people who trade currencies, their motivations, their lifestyles, you'd have to send your people to Harvard, Stanford and Wharton for years. Currency traders keep secrets very, very well, and to penetrate that would be the equivalent of cracking all the Japanese codes in World War II."
 
Enforcement
Blowing a Whistle On Foreign Bribes
 When Commerce Secretary Ronald H. Brown went to Congress on Thursday with his annual report about how the United States is meeting foreign competition abroad, he brought with him a secret annex.
It focused on tactics used by France, England, Germany, Japan and Canada to win deals, mostly in Asia. Most of the tactics were legal; many are practiced by Washington, including having the President press foreign countries to award business to American firms.
But the unclassified version of the report also cited "almost 100 cases of foreign firms using bribery to undercut U.S. firms' efforts to win international contracts worth about $45 billion," adding, "The foreign firms that offer bribes typically win about 80 percent of the deals."
The C.I.A. asserts that in several cases it has caught foreign companies bribing their way into billion-dollar contracts abroad. When that happens, the agency tells the State Department, which protests on behalf of American corporations and, on occasion, wins. "This is probably an area where our intelligence can be used most effectively," a senior official said. "It's where the agency is getting better."
 
Espionage
Risks and Rewards Of Spying on Allies
When corporate America talks to the C.I.A. about economic espionage, it often pleads for its competitors' secrets -- but in vain.
"If we're willing to do dirty tricks for the defense part of national security, then why aren't we able to do dirty tricks for the economic part?" asks Robert Kohler, a retired C.I.A. official and general manager of TRW Avionics & Surveillance Group.
The agency says it will not ask its officers to risk their lives for companies instead of their country. It will, however, continue to spy on American allies to understand national strategies. That entails its own risks.
The issue has been a constant source of tension in the American Embassy in Tokyo. During the last years of the cold war, American officials told the Japanese that the station was chiefly devoted to keeping track of China, North Korea and Russia's eastern ports. But Japanese officials are increasingly unhappy as it becomes clear that they are a primary target.
Tensions are also growing in Europe. France has spied on American companies for years, planting moles in companies like Boeing and Texas Instruments and breaking into hotel rooms to rifle through attache cases. In late 1993, the C.I.A. stepped up a counterattack.
"No more Mr. Nice Guy," a former C.I.A. chief, R. James Woolsey, has warned publicly. The C.I.A.'s Paris station got in the game -- with disastrous results.
A young aide to the French Prime Minister, Mr. Balladur, found himself being courted by an American woman who introduced herself as public relations director for a save-the-rain-forest foundation. French counterintelligence officers warned the aide, Henri Plagnol, that the woman was a C.I.A. operative -- and told him to play along.
A two-year-long sting developed. A male C.I.A. officer quizzed Mr. Plagnol about key French positions on the GATT talks, especially on agricultural issues and limits on the importation of American movies for French television. He handed the Frenchman 500-franc notes -- about $100 each -- for his information.
Other C.I.A. officers fell under French surveillance. Two sought GATT information from a communications ministry officer. Another tried to bribe an engineer with the state-run France Telecom for information that would help the C.I.A. bug French telecommunications.
In February, the affair blew up when the French publicly demanded the expulsion of the C.I.A. station chief, his deputy and two other C.I.A. officers. The agency's longstanding liaison with French intelligence -- crucial for joint operations such as tracking terrorists -- has been suspended. The C.I.A. inspector general is assessing whether the operation was worth it.

HEADLINE: NATO Chief May Resign Over Scandal

BYLINE: By CRAIG R. WHITNEY 

DATELINE: PARIS, Oct. 14

 BODY:
The NATO Secretary General, Willy Claes, said today that he was considering resigning, after a Belgian parliamentary commission decided this morning to recommend that the country's highest court indict him in a widening arms corruption scandal.
If Mr. Claes were forced to resign, after little more than a year in office, the 16-nation alliance would be leaderless as it enters a crucial period. The organization faces possible expansion to include new members in central Europe and the assumption of a peacekeeping role with up to 60,000 soldiers if a political settlement is reached in Bosnia. 
 Mr. Claes, a 56-year-old Flemish politician, defended himself for six hours Friday before former colleagues in an all-party Belgian parliamentary commission.
The panel is investigating charges that when he was Economic Affairs Minister of Belgium in 1988, his Socialist Party took $1.72 million in kickbacks from the Italian aircraft manufacturer Agusta S.p.A. for a $267 million contract to build 48 helicopters for the Belgian Army.
"I had the opportunity to confirm that I am totally innocent," Mr. Claes said after last night's hearings.
But after this morning's decision by the commission to allow the Belgian Supreme Court to indict him if Parliament votes on Thursday to lift his immunity, Mr. Claes told Belgian radio, "I am absolutely stunned."
Asked whether he would resign, he said, "I must examine the text and think about it before making any decision," and he said he would have to "have the necessary consultations within NATO."
One NATO colleague said it seemed increasingly unlikely that Mr. Claes could hold onto his job, and diplomats said informal consultations were already under way about possible successors.
The more or less declared candidates include Ruud Lubbers, a former Prime Minister from the Netherlands who ran unsuccessfully for the Presidency of the European Union's Executive Commission last year, and the former Prime Minister of Denmark, Uffe Ellemann-Jensen.
Douglas Hurd, who resigned as British Foreign Secretary earlier this year, has also been suggested, as has Lord Owen of Britain, the former Foreign Secretary David Owen.
Lord Owen was the European Union's mediator for the former Yugoslavia until last year, and in that position he was often criticized by American officials for yielding too easily to the Bosnian Serbs.
Mr. Claes, an amateur musician who often makes guest appearances as a symphony orchestra conductor, was Foreign Minister of Belgium when he was picked to succeed Manfred Worner of Germany in September of 1994 after Mr. Worner died of cancer.
But early this year, investigators pursuing the Belgian bribery scandal began putting the spotlight on Mr. Claes. At first, he denied even hearing about illegal payments by the Agusta firm. But in February, after a fellow leader of the Flemish-speaking Socialist Party said he remembered Mr. Claes being at a meeting when the party treasurer, Etienne Mange, said he had heard the Italians were offering bribes for the helicopter contract, he acknowledged his presence.
He insisted, though, that he had told Mr. Mange to reject the offer. The former treasurer has been jailed since February, and his lawyers have said that he ignored Mr. Claes's advice and took the money.
Mr. Claes has maintained that he never knew that any money had actually changed hands, insisting on this even after his former chief of staff at the Economic Affairs Ministry, Johan Delanghe, was arrested and charged in February.
Mr. Claes went ahead with a planned visit to the United States and a meeting with President Clinton in March even though by that time, the Defense Minister of the Netherlands, Joris Voorhoeve, was saying it was time for him to step down.

HEADLINE: South Korea's President, in a Rift With North, Delays Talks

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF 

DATELINE: SEOUL, South Korea, Oct. 14

 BODY:
Saying that he feels "betrayed" and "disappointed" by hard-line Communists in North Korea, President Kim Young Sam of South Korea today ruled out further steps any time soon toward reconciliation and dialogue on the Korean peninsula.
Mr. Kim, speaking in a 90-minute interview on the eve of a trip to Canada and the United States, where he will meet with President Clinton, also dismissed the prospect of a summit meeting soon between the leaders of the two Koreas. "Given the uncertainty surrounding North Korea, I don't think this is an appropriate time to talk about an inter-Korean summit meeting," he said. 
 His remarks underscore the hardening of attitudes in South Korea toward the north, and the degree to which disillusionment and distrust have replaced the hopes for dialogue that had hung in the air as recently as this spring. In June, for example, Mr. Kim had spoken with moderate enthusiasm about the possibility of a summit meeting.
The boundary between the two Koreas, a no-man's-land of mines, barbed wire, tank traps and secret underground tunnels, remains the site of the greatest massing of enemy troops anywhere on the globe.
The United States has a huge stake in peace on the peninsula. While the border between the Koreas is no longer seen as a potential tripwire for World War III, as it was a decade or two ago, it remains a possible battleground involving United States troops and perhaps even nuclear weapons.
Mr. Kim's statements suggest that in Korea at least, the cold war is not only still alive but also risks breaking into a real war at any time.
"Our concern is that because of their desperation or frustration about their declining economy, they may start on a course of adventurous military provocation," Mr. Kim said. He added that signs of this have already become apparent in the last few months, with North Korea's beefing up its armed forces and giving more power to the armed forces.
The mood in Korea today contrasts with optimism that flickered quite recently. Last year, Mr. Kim was preparing for a summit meeting with the North Korean President, Kim Il Sung, when he suddenly died.
Then this spring, North Korea showed unexpected flexibility by asking for rice shipments to ease a shortage at home. South Korea began to ship rice to the north, and hopes grew that a peace process could be built on the sacks of rice.
Then North Korea forced one of the South Korean ships carrying rice to raise a North Korean flag and detained crew members of another on charges of spying. In addition, North Korea continued to hold a fishing boat and crew that it had seized at sea earlier this year.
Mr. Kim said today that the North Koreans had promised that if they received rice, they would release the fishing boat and also stop broadcasting denunciations of the South Korean Government. But the fishing boat and crew remain in northern hands and the broadcasts continue.
"We felt betrayed and we were very disappointed by North Korea's breach of its promises," Mr. Kim said. "North Korea is a very difficult partner to deal with. The ball is in North Korea's court now."
For South Korea to resume rice shipments and other steps toward reconciliation, Mr. Kim said, North Korea must first release the fishing boat and stop the broadcasts vilifying South Korea.
One factor behind Mr. Kim's tough line may be that his own popularity has dropped sharply. His Government has been criticized for being too weak to North Korea, so a tough policy may play well at home.
It is difficult to gauge North Korea's reaction, because North Korean leaders have refused to give interviews. But North Korean broadcasts argue that it was South Korea that deliberately poisoned the climate, and that the breakthrough needed to bring peace to the Korean peninsula is for the United States and North Korea to recognize each other.
President Kim, who in 1993 became South Korea's first elected civilian president in a generation, spoke warmly of the role of the 37,000 United States troops in South Korea in deterring invasion and war. Yet Mr. Kim also called for a revision of the Status of Forces Agreement, the document that stipulates how American soldiers and military bases are to be treated under Korean law.
South Korea and Japan now are both seeking changes in those agreements, largely because of popular resentment at crimes attributed to American soldiers. Mr. Kim warned that anti-Americanism would increase unless the Status of Forces Agreement is amended.
The Governments of both South Korea and Japan say they want to keep American bases. But the irritation at reported crimes and the demands for revising the documents have added to the uncertainties.
Although President Kim has railed at human rights abuses in North Korea, he strongly defended South Korea's rigid national security law, which is used to imprison peaceful supporters of North Korea.

HEADLINE: At Annual Gathering of Business Council, the Mood Is Upbeat

BYLINE: By JUDITH H. DOBRZYNSKI 

DATELINE: WILLIAMSBURG, Va., Oct. 14

 BODY:
The great funk that President Clinton said last month was afflicting the American public was nowhere to be seen these last few days, as the nation's business leaders gathered here for the annual meeting of the Business Council.
Rather, their mood was sunny, matching the clear blue skies that shined over this colonial resort. The chief executives were upbeat about both the economy and the eventual outcome of the bickering in Washington over balancing the budget. 
 The executives predicted healthy growth in corporate profits for the rest of this year and for 1996 -- some timed in double digits. They praised the Federal Reserve Board and its chairman, Alan Greenspan, for their management of monetary policy. "The Fed has been able to engineer a soft landing for the first time in history," said Richard M. Rosenberg, chief executive of the BankAmerica Corporation.
And as the gathering ended today, they called on Mr. Clinton to reappoint Mr. Greenspan as Fed chairman when his term expires next spring. "He has done a first-class job," said John F. Welch Jr., chairman and chief executive of the General Electric Company.
John L. Weinberg, senior chairman of Goldman, Sachs & Company, and other executives did express concern about the direction of interest rates. In a poll of members before the meeting, more than 80 percent of the respondents predicted that economic growth would continue in the 2 to 2 1/2 percent range during the next 12 months. They also saw inflation remaining flat.
"We'd like to see some moderate reduction in interest rates," said Mr. Rosenberg of BankAmerica.
About the only time these chief executives showed reserve was Friday evening, when Mr. Clinton addressed them. He gave a fighting speech -- he has backed off his pronouncement of a nationwide funk -- and recapped his achievements. He asked the executives to help facilitate a budget compromise between the Republican-controlled Congress and the White House.
The Republican plan aims at balancing the budget over seven years and makes deep cuts in Federal spending as well as offering tax cuts. The Democratic plan takes longer to end the red ink and makes smaller spending reductions.
"What I want is to get together with Congress and get a budget out that is an honorable compromise that is better than theirs and better than mine," Mr. Clinton said. "All I'm asking you to do is say, just get together, come up with something."
Throughout the speech, the Business Council members sat stony-faced, rarely interrupting with applause. When the President finished, he received a polite ovation.
The executives seemed less than worried about the budgetary stand-off, even though it threatens to shut the Federal Government if no agreement is reached by Nov. 15. "It's a war dance," said Edwin L. Artzt, who retired in July as chairman of the Procter & Gamble Company but remains on the company's board. "They have to work it out and they will work it out."
Some corporate chieftains are even heartened by the debate. "It's healthy to some degree, because there are tough choices to be made," said Joseph T. Gorman, chairman and chief executive of TRW Inc.
Lawrence A. Bossidy, chairman of Allied Signal Inc., predicted agreement after "another five to six weeks of political theater."
Many executives dismissed the dire predictions that a Government shutdown, should it happen, would roil the financial markets.

HEADLINE: Black Men Say the March in Washington Is About Them, Not Farrakhan

BYLINE: By KAREN DE WITT 

DATELINE: CLINTON, Md., Oct. 12

 BODY:
At the Update Barber Salon in a tiny mall here, outside the District of Columbia, no one questions whether Monday's planned march in the capital by thousands of black men is a good thing.
The shop's largely working-class black customers -- the airmen from nearby Andrews Air Force Base, the fathers with their sons -- and the barbers themselves, say the call for atonement, responsibility and unity that is the theme of the Million Man March is long overdue. 
 Much of the media focus has been on controversies about the march. Louis Farrakhan, the leader of the Nation of Islam and the initiator of the march, has been denounced by critics as an anti-Semite, race-baiter and homophobe. Some prominent black leaders and organizations have been unwilling to endorse or participate in the demonstration because of Mr. Farrakhan's role and some black women have criticized the exclusion of women by the organizers.
But the men in the barber shop say all these things are beside the point. For them, the march is not about any of that. It's about them.
 "Somewhere along the way we just forgot what we should be about," said Lewis Brandon, an airman. "The march isn't totally a stop sign, but it's a yield sign that says we should hold up."
So when an evening news program on a television in the corner features an interview with Mr. Farrakhan, the usual banter and gibes of barber and client halt.
In the interview, Mr. Farrakhan denies he is a racial provocateur or separatist, saying that he is calling on black men to be responsible to their communities, a message he has been delivering for years. There are nods of approval in the shop. When the announcer tells Mr. Farrakhan that Rep. Gary Franks, a black Republican from Connecticut, has denounced the march and will not come, that one Catholic priest will participate while another disavows the march because Mr. Farrakhan is the sponsor, one customer spits, "Who cares?"
For the men in the Update, the march is an opportunity for black men to address their condition at a time when their median income is half that of white men, where high unemployment seems endemic among black men and low academic achievement seems to be their norm.
"We have to begin with ourselves," said Darryl Pinkston, one of the barbers. "All the answers lie within ourselves."
At the barber shop, the men said the gathering is a chance to air "within the family" the dirty laundry of the black community: the wayward boys and men, deteriorating families, the drugs and crime that have turned once-stable inner city black neighborhoods into killing fields and made black men eight times more likely to be murdered than white men. These men say that it is time to put away poor excuses and elevate good examples, to take public a private conversation about morals and values that has been going on among blacks for more than two decades.
In fact, they hope the Monday march will be cathartic.
"We have to make an atonement," said Tim Taylor, a barber whose brother, Rick, is co-owner of the shop. "We have to begin to take back our neighborhoods. We have to give the brothers who have fallen by the wayside a chance, but bring judgment against them if they continue in the error of their ways."
The men here also see the march as a way to counter what they view as the media's overwhelmingly negative images of blacks, particularly black males. They see the media as invariably racializing America's problems, putting a black face on welfare, a black face on the problems of crime and drugs. This, they believe, has left many blacks afraid to speak out about about moral issues.
"Sure there are some who have defiled themselves, selling drugs, etc., but the bad images of black men are systematically put in place and highlighted," says Rick Taylor, co-owner of the shop.
"I don't see a representative of myself in the media," said Tim Taylor, his brother. "All the images in the media of black men are negative."
"And that's not our state in here," Rick Taylor chimed back. "We're working-class black men working every day taking care of our families. I'm pro-black but any man who doesn't take care of his family is worse than a dog."
The march, they predict, will refute those images and celebrate the majority of black men, who work hard and contribute to their communities. Men like themselves who moved to towns like this for safer streets, better housing and better schools.
Glenn C. Loury, a conservative black economist, has noted that the overwhelming majority of blacks are part of the middle and working classes and has said that only about 10 percent of those who are poor have the multiple problems that have come to represent the community.
"God first, family second," said one man. "If you take care of the family, then the community will be all right."
One force that has remained a obstacle for them, they say, is racism.
The men share tales of racial prejudice -- the wary glance in a store, the arbitrary harassment by police, the assumption that they are, in general, up to no good. They discuss on the reasons behind black-on-black crime, the legacy of slavery. They argue over the need for affirmative action. And while they acknowledge the contributions of strong black women -- several were raised by single mothers -- they say it is easier for black women to get work than for black men.
"Caucasian men fear black men so they hire black females," said Lewis Brandon, the airman.
Ivy Brandon, a 43-year-old computer technician who works for the Washington Metropolitan Transit Authority and is unrelated to Lewis Brandon, drew bitter laughter when he recounted getting call backs for jobs because employers assumed from his name that he was a woman.
Preliminary responses to a study of employer and worker attitudes in Atlanta, Boston, Detroit and Los Angeles sponsored by the Ford Foundation, and as yet unfinished, substantiate some of their experiences. Black men are often seen as lazy and hostile and lacking the go-along, get-along attitudes employers demand in a downsizing economy. Employers complain of the same problems with white workers, but Chris Tilly, a labor economist at the University of Massachusetts, said the widespread negative stereotypes of black men means they are at a disadvantage in job interviews if the interviewer is white.
In many ways, though, black men are reacting to the same thing that are angering white men. Real wages for working class men, regardless of race, have declined sharply over the two decades.
"The reality is that they're all in the same boat," said Harry J. Holzer, professor of economics at Michigan State University, visiting scholar at the Russell Sage Foundation.
Structural changes in the economy and a shift from a manufacturing to a service economy has meant that, the median real wages for full-time male workers have fallen from $34,048 in 1973 to $30,407 in 1993. Young men, ages 25 to 34, have been hit hardest of all. Their wages are down 25 percent.
For those without a college education, the situation is even worse. In 1979, college educated men earned 40 percent more than the average high school graduate, today the gap has nearly doubled with the college-educated earning 75 percent more.
Still, black men have been hit the hardest of all. In the 1970's, 75 percent of black men were able to maintain full-time, full-year employment, said Secretary of Labor Robert Reich. In the 1980's, that number dropped to 50 percent.
"If you compare white men, white women, black men and black women, black men have fallen farthest and hardest in terms of wages, benefits and employment," Mr. Reich said.
The men in the barber shop may not know the statistics or where they fit in a new global economic structure, but they know that something is terribly wrong in their communities and they say they want to put it right, beginning with themselves.
"The march is a line," says another man. "This is where we cut the madness off."
Other men offer their analyses:
"The older generation bears some of the responsibility for where we are," says another.
"Integration, that's where we got off track."
"Prisons -- all these young black men in prison -- it's just a new form of slavery."
The conversation in the barber shop is as thick as the clippings of hair on the floor round each chair. To a man, despite ideological differences, despite sharp clashes over some of its principles, the men say they will attend the march.
It is not, as one man put it, about what is "going on on the podium, but what is going on on the ground."

HEADLINE: Calcutta Hopes as Communists Push Free Marke

BYLINE: By JOHN F. BURNS 

DATELINE: CALCUTTA, India

 BODY:
Until last fall, American diplomats working in a high-walled compound in one of this city's more prosperous districts were often made to feel unwanted. During the Vietnam War, the street outside the United States Consulate General was renamed for Ho Chi Minh. The gesture signaled the onset of 25 years of demonstrations and harassment that made the consulate one of the most beleaguered American diplomatic posts anywhere.
Then, suddenly, from one day to the next, the protests stopped. Where angry crowds once threw up makeshift platforms against the consulate walls for left-wing politicians to declaim against American imperialism, Calcutta businessmen now line up for visas that will give them a crack at the burgeoning trade between India and the United States. 
 The new mood reflects the wider changes in India, which has sought improved relations with the United States since New Delhi's alliance with the Soviet Union collapsed. Nowhere has the change reverberated more strongly than in Calcutta, the capital of West Bengal, which has been governed since 1978 by a breakaway faction of the Indian Communist Party, the Communist Party of India (Marxist).
While land reforms introduced by the Communists broke up feudal fiefs that had dominated the state of West Bengal for centuries and produced some of the most bountiful grain harvests anywhere in India, the poverty that has made Calcutta a byword for urban degradation has shown little sign of receding.
Now, for the first time in a generation, Calcuttans are beginning to hope that the city's long descent may finally be over. Since September 1994, the government here has formally thrown its weight behind the free-market economic reforms that were adopted by the national Government in New Delhi in 1991.
In place of helter-skelter nationalization, work stoppages that had driven thousands of businesses into bankruptcy, and a general climate of hostility toward outsiders, the Communists here have become arch-apostles for the new doctrines of free enterprise, foreign investment and a work culture that emphasizes productivity over strikes.
These days, visitors calling on Jyoti Basu, the 82-year-old Communist leader who heads the state government as Chief Minister, are likely to find him tinkering with his new desktop computer in the Writer's Building, the colonial edifice that served as the East India Company's headquarters when it ruled much of India in the 18th and 19th centuries.
Mr. Basu himself, immaculate in a homespun muslin dhoti, reminisces about his visit this summer to the United States, where he criss-crossed the country addressing Wall Street bankers and corporate executives from Boston to San Francisco.
Mr. Basu shakes his head vigorously when visitors suggest that the collapse of the Soviet Union helped bankrupt the ideology he has followed since the British authorities imprisoned him for his work as an underground Communist leader more than 50 years ago.
"A debacle has taken place in the Soviet Union, but we don't think it as the end of Marxism," he said.
Still, Mr. Basu speaks of his new policies in ways that make them hard to distinguish from those of the governing Congress Party leaders in New Delhi, who initiated the free-market economic reforms at the national level that have set off a rush for private investment, especially foreign investment, by India's 32 states and territories.
"If you are a Marxist or a Socialist, you must look at the realities of the situation, not what you imagine to be there," he said.
His conversion could have far-reaching implications, and not only for West Bengal, whose 70 million people remain close to the bottom of Asia's social and economic ladder. Although the economic reforms appear to have stalled at the national level, many Indians cite acceptance of the reforms in West Bengal -- a bastion of Indian Communism since the 1930's -- as proof that whatever the short-run political obstacles to free-market reforms, India ultimately has nowhere else to go.
Also, political pundits continue to suggest Mr. Basu as a possible prime minister after general elections expected in March or April. With the Congress Party undermined by allegations of high-level corruption and by divisions over the economic reforms, many commentators predict that the pro-reform wing of the Congress Party could be forced to seek a coalition with left-wing groups, including the the Communists, whose two main factions, including the Basu group, hold 50 of the 545 seats in Parliament.
So far, in Calcutta, the reforms' effects have been limited. Especially during the monsoons, the city presents a dispiriting spectacle of decaying buildings, vast slums where millions survive amid seas of mud and filth, sidewalks lined with the homeless sleeping on mats of sodden cardboard, stick-thin mothers with small children begging a few rupees for food.
Along traffic-clogged avenues in the city center, signs suggest that Mr. Basu and his colleagues have started not so much a revolution as a battle for the city's soul. Ho Chi Minh Street and others renamed by the Communists -- Lenin Street, Karl Marx Street -- testify to old loyalties, as do posters in the bazaars that urge Calcuttans to attend a pro-Cuba congress at which Mr. Basu denounced the United States "imperialism" against Fidel Castro.
But Socialist paraphernalia are dwarfed by billboard advertisements for mobile telephones and whisky and computer courses. And in a building close to the mansion from which Britain's governors general ruled India for 150 years, a close ally of Mr. Basu in the state's Communist hierarchy runs an investment promotion agency -- the West Bengal Industrial Development Corporation -- that many Westerners, including the United States Ambassador, Frank G. Wisner, regard as the best of its kind in India.
Anybody visiting Somnath Chatterjee, the agency's chairman, finds it harder to imagine India's retreating from the free-market reforms. Like Mr. Basu, Mr. Chatterjee can box like a champion on matters of ideology, arguing that the Soviet Union failed not because of repression and economic sclerosis but because, as he put it, "the entire world ganged up on Soviet Russia."
Mr. Chatterjee, 66, who has a second role heading the Communist bloc in the Parliament in New Delhi, greets visitors from behind a desk that would not look out of place in the Oval Office.
When asked how a Marxist adjusts to negotiating with executives from a roll-call of the world's blue-chip corporations -- Caltex, Matsushita, Motorola, Philips, Price Waterhouse, Rolls-Royce, Siemens -- that have signed tentative investment deals, Mr. Chatterjee smiled.
"I am a very practical person, like all Communists," he said. Perhaps with an eye to Communist Party stalwarts who have yet to reconcile to the changes, he added: "Inviting foreign capital is regretful. But from the viewpoint of the people's interests, there is no choice. I have no right to keep them poor."
Mr. Basu and Mr. Chatterjee -- indeed, just about anybody who discusses the matter in West Bengal -- acknowledges another motive. When Britain moved India's capital from Calcutta to New Delhi in 1912, and as late as the 1950's, when Bombay entered the era of rapid growth that has made it India's industrial and commercial powerhouse, Calcutta considered itself India's leading city. Today, after 20 years of shrinking production, it is a distant second to Bombay, but Mr. Basu is confident that "within a few years we will regain our old position."
But before the long climb back, the government will have to convince elements of its own constituency, particularly West Bengal's powerful labor unions, that free enterprise is the key to a better future.
Hundreds of other state-owned enterprises are bogged down by restrictive labor practises and red tape. Many have been technically bankrupt for years, unable to discipline or lay off workers; some, including factories with thousands of workers, have produced nothing at all in recent memory.
The Communist leaders also face an internal party struggle over the new policies. At the party headquarters here, posters of Stalin and Che Guevara adorn the walls. But despite talk of the "dictatorship of the proletariat" and "scientific socialism," there are signs that even the hard-liners have found ways to see old enemies in a new light.
"We are not inviting capitalism to West Bengal; we are inviting capital," said Anil Biswas, editor of the party's newspaper.
Reaching for a dog-eared copy of the Communist Manifesto, he turned to the section on capital and added triumphantly, "Read that, and you'll see that capitalism and capital are two entirely different things."

HEADLINE: Rejecting Elders' Pessimism, Students Jam Medical School

BYLINE: By ELISABETH ROSENTHAL 

 BODY:
Doctors in private practice complain about H.M.O.'s. Economists predict that doctors' incomes will fall and there will be fewer jobs for specialists. Physicians forbid their children to enter the field.
And yet, despite this loud, woeful chorus, American college students are stampeding the gates of medical schools in record numbers. Last year, 45,365 people applied to American medical schools, a record, and almost double the number eight years ago. This year, with the final count still out, that record has already been surpassed. 
 The surprising enthusiasm of young people training to become doctors, despite the upheaval in the field, is likely to accelerate and smooth over the transformation of American medicine, a process that so far been rocky.
Rather than war with health maintenance organizations and budget-minded legislators, medicine's next generation is entering the profession expecting to be part of a more cost-conscious medical system oriented to primary care and dominated by managed care. Many medical students say they will work for a salary. Doctors in training are already turning in growing numbers to careers in general medicine, forgoing the specialist's income and prestige.
"The young doctors today are the ones pushing the engine," said Mark Callahan, director of health services research at Cornell University Medical College. "They're receptive to change in a way no one had predicted."
Medical educators debate the causes for the rise in medical school applications, citing the relative security of medicine in a bleak job market or the gritty glamour cast on physicians by shows like "E.R." But many of the 16,000 men and women who this fall donned white coats and rolled back plastic sheets to face cadavers for the first time give a simpler explanation: They think it will be fulfilling and interesting to take care of sick people.
"A lot of us went into medicine for different reasons than doctors 10 years ago," said Jennifer Gonzalez, a first-year student at Albert Einstein College of Medicine in the Bronx. "Everyone knows there are going to be changes. We're not expecting high-paying jobs. I don't mind being forced into primary care. If you go into medicine now, your goal is not money or prestige but simply treating patients."
In dozens of interviews across the country, medical students said they were well aware of the gloomy projections -- hammered home by older doctors in their lecture halls each day. But for the most part, they say they do not share their colleagues' nostalgia for a world where doctors reigned supreme, a world of small practices and big incomes, a world they view as history.
"It's like when people say baseball isn't what it used to be, now that there are three divisions instead of two," said Robert Pratt, a first-year student at Columbia's College of Physicians and Surgeons. "That may be true. But this is the only game we know."
Medicine has always attracted young people with a desire to help others. But until recently that altruistic route was nicely paved with the promise of being your own boss and getting big money -- particularly for specialists -- and respect. Today those benefits have eroded, leaving many older doctors disaffected -- but many doctors-to-be undeterred.
 
'Dumbest Time,' Friends Warn
 When David Klemer, 39, quit his job as a tenured professor of engineering at the University of Texas to go to medical school this year, his friends were shocked.
"They said that this is the dumbest time in the history of medicine to do this," he said, three weeks into his first year of medical school, and still smiling. "But I wanted to do family practice. To make a difference in people's lives. Money didn't enter into the picture."
Several years ago, doctors' groups warned that the vast changes in health care policy would make the medical market so uncertain that the brightest students would be deterred from becoming doctors. That prophecy has proved unfounded.
"If anything it's getting more competitive," said Dr. Edward Hundert, associate dean for student affairs at Harvard Medical School. "A lot of us think: 'Thank God I'm not applying now because I wouldn't get in.' " For new medical students, the average score on the Medical College Admissions Test has risen steadily, as has their college grade point average, to 3.47, on the border of a B plus and an A minus.
Many students arrive at medical school today with Ph.D.'s or successes in previous careers, Dr. Hundert said. The median age among first-year students has risen almost to 25, up from 22 a decade ago. Forty-two percent are women, up from just over 30 percent in 1984.
Some medical students and educators link the rise in applications to a sense of public duty among young people, in contrast to the "me" focus a decade ago. "I think there's a trend with people wanting more of a connection with society, with doing something meaningful," said Jennifer Anderson, a first-year student at the University of Washington Medical School who said she hopes to practice in a rural area.
Dr. Hundert agreed, noting that entering medical students at Harvard were volunteering in droves for community service projects, like teaching sex education at inner city schools or reading books to children with cancer. Ten years ago, he said, they would have been scrambling to labs. "It may well be that there will be more of a service mentality, which would be a happy thing for medicine," he said.
Dr. Jordan J. Cohen, president of the American Association of Medical Colleges, added that advances in basic science -- and the way they are trumpeted on TV shows or the evening news -- have seduced idealistic young people, who imagine doling out new cures.
But some are more skeptical, saying the popularity is related less to the allure of medicine than to a slump in the economy. They note that new doctors, unlike new lawyers, still tend to have jobs. A recent paper by Dr. Donald Kassenbaum in the journal American Medicine concluded that a significant cause of the rise in applications was the poor job market for college graduates, propelling cautious students toward careers perceived as dependable.
 
Less Boot Camp In Medical Training
 "A lot of people go to college wanting to be either a doctor or a lawyer -- and being a lawyer has a really bad reputation now," said Sacha St. Hill, a first-year student at the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey, in Newark, who said she wanted to be a doctor, regardless of status or pay.
All agree, however, that reforms in medical training and practice, which have reduced the sacrifices required, have bolstered the trend. Medical schools have de-emphasized rote memorization. Residencies have largely eliminated the requirement of spending every other night in the hospital, an existence part monk and part commando. Many hospitals and H.M.O.'s offer physicians part-time options, attractive to doctors with young children.
"If you're going to have a professional career, medicine allows for the greatest flexibility of life style, particularly in certain types of practice," said Jaymi Fermaglich, a first-year student at Einstein, interested in bioethics. "I have friends who are investment bankers. They work 80 hours and have no control."
Many medical students felt they had little in common with their older colleagues and were by turns amused and annoyed at the ever-present diatribes about the fall of medicine. Students at the New Jersey medical school laughed as they recalled a lecturer who started with a cartoon making fun of H.M.O.'s, and repeated his hatred for managed care 10 more times in an hour.
A number of students acknowledged that the medical system was in dire need of reform. "A lot of the decisions are being taken away from the physician -- what procedures to perform, and how much to charge," said Rachel D. St. John, a student at Virginia Commonwealth University. "It's frustrating, but it needs to be done. It's not working now -- we're not serving the entire public."
Practicing doctors complain bitterly that they must answer to employers, insurers, consumer groups and H.M.O.'s. But these constraints are not nearly as disturbing to medical students, who may have already had extensive contact with H.M.O.'s.
Randall Finley, a first-year student at Einstein, is a doctor's son. But his father, a pediatric gastroenterologist, works for Kaiser-Permanente, a large H.M.O. in California, where H.M.O.'s are the norm. "I haven't made up my mind about H.M.O.'s, but the fact that I don't have to do any of the business side is attractive to me," he said. "All of the doctors I know in H.M.O.'s -- my father's friends -- are happy there."
Almost 25 percent of entering medical students last year said they preferred to be employees, seeing patients for a salary. That percentage has risen steadily for the last eight years.
 
'I Want the Freedom To Do What I Want'
 "Working for someone else and having set hours means you can have a family and a little more free time," said Michele Puszkarczuk, a first-year student at the New Jersey medical school, whose interest in medicine started with putting Band-Aids on dolls as a toddler.
Nonetheless, she said: "I am worried that you won't be able to have control over your patients." Other students worried that their choice of specialty or job might be limited.
Joseph Helft, a first-year student at Einstein, has his heart set on private practice, like that of his father, a general surgeon. He worries that his dream is in jeopardy. "I see working for an H.M.O. as being low down in a big company where you can't make decisions," he said. "I want the freedom to do what I want to do and to specialize in whatever I want. But when I see how fed up my father is, it's scary."
Declining salaries, which have caused problems for older doctors -- with mortgages and children in private school -- are also less troubling to new applicants, who expect medicine to yield a comfortable income, if not the million-dollar practices that some specialists now enjoy.
"Going from $400,000 to probably $120,000 or lowest, $80,000, is not exactly a tragedy," said Jean Paul Rommes, who was an engineer until he entered medical school at the University of Texas this fall. "It's all relative. Eighty thousand is a great salary in most people's minds." He and other students expressed confidence medicine would remain a stable career.
Most students who were interviewed said their families were pleased with their decision to go to medical school. But all agreed that the letter of acceptance was no longer an occasion marked by celebrations and the bragging of grandparents. Many said they had to defend the choice to friends or family.
Stephan Chimosky, 30, gave up a career as a computer consultant to enter medical school this year, despite attempts by his father, a physician, to dissuade him. "I had a well-established career and I had a lot of counseling not to change from family members," said Mr. Chimosky, an M.B.A. who is now a student at the University of Washington.
Although many doctors say they do not want their children to enter the field, the fraction of new medical students whose parents are physicians -- about 16 percent -- is unchanged. And a number of students from medical families said that their parents were supportive.
"A lot of my father's friends say to him 'How can you let your son go to medical school?' " said Chris Morse, a first-year student at Columbia, whose father and grandfather are urologists. "My father's had to make a lot of adjustments, but he's educated me that medicine is changing and it's not so bad. What other job can you see interesting things and change people's lives?"
Next: The shift to primary care.

HEADLINE: Riders on the Storm

 BODY:
The O. J. Simpson case has produced a hot blast of racial disaffection in the country, and no one should be surprised that charlatans of all hues want to use that blast to lift unworthy careers and causes to new heights. Similarly, it is no surprise that Louis Farrakhan is foremost among the callous self-promoters. It is also unsurprising that the Rev. Benjamin Chavis Jr., whose disgraceful behavior almost wrecked the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, should have signed on as director of Mr. Farrakhan's Million Man March.
These two black men have this in common with the white racists of the previous generation. They want to prolong and exploit the nation's racial divisions. Yet their cunning invocations of black family stability and of a potent symbolic event, the 1963 March on Washington, have tended to make people of conscience overly timid about criticizing either their contrived event or the twisted Farrakhan ideology that it is intended to promote. 
 In endorsing the march, the Rev. Jesse Jackson and the Black Congressional Caucus have foolishly let a misguided solidarity about the march's public goals divert their attention from the ideas and character of its leader. Mary Frances Berry, chairwoman of the United States Commission on Civil Rights, has correctly diagnosed Mr. Farrakhan's pathology as racist, sexist, anti-Semitic and homophobic.
The coalition of black feminists led by Angela Davis and Jewell Jackson McCabe emphasized one of the many dangers inherent in this march. They labeled the march's message that it is "time for men to step forward and women to step back" as an insult to 400 years of burden-sharing by black men and women.
It is understandable that many black Americans will be tempted to overlook Mr. Farrakhan's separatism and Mr. Chavis's financial and personal peccadilloes because of a shared concern about drugs, unstable families, unemployment and violence. But they should realize that Mr. Farrakhan intends to use their support to aggrandize himself and the Nation of Islam. There has been a lot of talk about apples and trees lately. Everyone must recognize that only poisoned apples can fall from Mr. Farrakhan's tree.
In the last few days, even as his mainstream allies tried to buff up Mr. Farrakhan for national consumption or downplay his involvement, the man and his minions have become ever more flagrant in their racist self-promotion. In an interview released by Reuters on Friday, Mr. Farrakhan asserted that Jews, Arabs, Koreans and Vietnamese doing business in black communities are "bloodsuckers." On Thursday, Mr. Farrakhan's chief of staff told a press conference that those who march will be showing that they personally support Mr. Farrakhan and that they look to him as a national leader.
But contempt for the leaders of the march must not lead to any kind of national denial about the underlying realities of race in America. Prejudice remains a historic, thematic problem in American politics and law. The behavior of the Los Angeles police, the ceaseless Beltway war against Government programs that benefit minorities, the commercial excesses of the O. J. industry all attest to the continuing need for healing leadership. The way ahead will be made rougher by talk shows, tabloids and, if recent events are an indicator, perhaps by Mr. Simpson's delusional campaign for some kind of public approbation.
None of that changes one truth that serves this moment. No matter how many well-meaning citizens he can mislead on any given day, Mr. Farrakhan remains a symptom of our ills, not a physician who can heal them.

BYLINE: By MAUREEN DOWD 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
We grew up in the shadow of Fort Stevens, where Lincoln in his frock coat dodged the bullets of Jubal Early's Confederate troops in the battle that saved the capital.
You might say we grew up in the shadow of union. Cynthia and Deborah were my best friends and next-door neighbors. Though they were black and I was white, the significance of the fort escaped us. But it was a good place to go sledding. 
 In those days, we did not need sensitivity training. We had the same desires and disappointments. We played Double Dutch. (Now we would be accused of offending the Dutch.) We snitched the key to my dad's Seth Thomas to tighten our roller skates. We snuck in to see Vincent Price in "The Fall of the House of Usher."
Later, I would understand there were problems. I remember the fight the nuns waged when an amusement park did not want to let the black kids in our class come to a picnic. (They came. Never bet against nuns.) As children, we treated each other with maturity. As adults, we learned to be childish, to pick up and keep up tribal resentments. As the song from "South Pacific" goes, "You've got to be taught to hate and fear, to hate all the people your relatives hate."
Affirmative action has brought the sexes and races into the same room, but with wariness about who might get ahead. Just as men and women in the workplace circle each other, so do blacks and whites. If the sexes can't communicate clearly, why should it be simple for different races?
In the wake of the Simpson verdict, with the polarizing images of black thrills and white chills, and on the eve of the Million Man March, led by a man who peddles racial and religious divisions to promote himself, whites and blacks suddenly seem frozen in a split screen of resentment and incomprehension.
But is it so sudden? Or had we lived and played apart for so long that we lost track of how different our experiences and thoughts and perceptions of progress were?
The truth is that Washington has never become truly integrated. Whites cluster west of Rock Creek Park, in tony neighborhoods like Cleveland Park and Georgetown. Blacks live on the other side of the park, in nice middle-class neighborhoods, and beyond, in the dangerous, desolate places that are not listed on the tourist maps. We work together, but then, mostly, we retreat to separate worlds.
I went back to Rittenhouse Street, where it had seemed so easy to understand how blacks looked at the world, to see how they felt about the march and this split screen of O. J. Simpson and Mark Fuhrman.
(The truth is that the racist detective was my worst nightmare, too. My father was also a police detective. As a reporter, I avoided working on any stories about police brutality or corruption. I couldn't bear to know about bad cops poisoning the quiet bravery of good cops.)
I talked to Kelvin Tabbs, a 22-year-old college student in a Raiders cap, who said that white liberals are upset about the Farrakhan march because "they do not have the power to control blacks and choose their leaders.
"All these white people say, 'Don't blame me for what my forefathers did.' But they're missing the point. It's still going on, but it's a hidden agenda. I'm an ex-football player, a big black guy. Every time I walk into a store, people look at me suspiciously until I smile and start talking. We don't judge whites by the way they look, even if we see a guy who looks like Jesse Helms coming down the street."
Ray Thompson, a 40-year-old Navy veteran who is an electromagnetic signal analyst, was unpacking fishing gear from his car. He knows that Louis Farrakhan has a divisive message, but he thinks blacks need to hear his credo of economic independence. "Sometimes it seems that racism is like violence, a circle that has no beginning and no end," he said, softly. "People taking revenge for actions against them, or perceived actions, or historical actions. It's like Bosnia. Where does it end? When do we say: Both sides are guilty -- let's stop and move forward from here?"
He thinks that if we can talk to each other, instead of about each other, coded racism can be uncoded. "It's like a tiger lying out there, hiding behind the bushes," he said. "I'd rather know the tiger is there. That way, I may stand some chance of dealing with it effectively."

HEADLINE: Clinton Asks Men to Pledge Never to Strike Any Woman

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 14

 BODY:
President Clinton called on the nation's men today to pledge to "never, never lift a hand against a woman for as long as we live."
Mr. Clinton, who as a youngster intervened to stop his stepfather from beating his mother, made the appeal "not just as a president, or a father or a husband, but also as a son who has seen domestic violence first hand." 
 The President, in his weekly radio address, said the Republican-controlled Congress was bent on reducing the Government's domestic-violence programs by $50 million, hampering "our efforts to protect battered women and their children, to preserve families and to punish these crimes."
Mr. Clinton's overall message appeared aimed at people upset at O. J. Simpson's acquittal last week on charges of murdering his ex-wife and her friend. Mr. Simpson has admitted that he battered Mrs. Simpson.
On Monday, in a speech at the University of Texas in Austin, Mr. Clinton is set to address the racial divisions highlighted by the Simpson trial.
The speech coincides not only with the debate over the Simpson verdict but with Monday's rally of black men in Washington.
"I imagine he will address the need to bring Americans together and to shun those who advocate hate," said Michael D. McCurry, the White House press secretary.
Mr. Clinton has also remained focused on his budget battle with Congress.
And in a speech Friday night in Williamsburg, Va., he appealed to the chief executives of the nation's 100 largest corporations, all members of the Business Council, to broker an "honorable compromise" with Congress.
"The only thing I won't do," Mr. Clinton said. "I will not let balancing the budget serve as a cover for destroying the social compact; for cutting back on education, wrecking the environment or undermining our obligations to help protect our children and treat our elderly people decently because it is not necessary to balance the budget."
Delivering the weekly Republican radio address, Senator Pete Domenici of New Mexico took exception to Mr. Clinton's criticism of Republican budget cuts.
"America's budget deficit is growing at a rate of $482 million a day, but President Clinton won't support the balanced budget plan because he says balancing the budget in seven years is too fast," Mr. Domenici said. "It's not too fast for the unemployed, or underemployed, who can't get good work because of the deficit's stifling effect on job creation."
In his own radio address, Mr. Clinton noted that his Administration's crime bill, voted into law last year, also included the Violence Against Women Act, which he said combined sanctions against abusers with aid to the police, prosecutors and shelters.
But he said government alone could not prevail.
"The real solution to this problem starts with us, with our personal responsibility and a simple pledge that we will never, never lift a hand against a woman for as long as we live," the President said.

HEADLINE: ARCHITECTURE VIEW;
Lifting the Sights of a Neighborhood Tired and Low

BYLINE: By Herbert Muschamp 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES

 BODY:
WHEN IT COMES TO MEDIA coverage of Los Angeles, the rule seems to be: if you bash it, they will come; if you build it, they'll stay away in droves. Stage an earthquake, ignite a riot, and it will make the cover of Time magazine. But where are the helicopters, the television cameras, the real-time, live-action coverage that in a less topsy-turvy world would allow us to watch the completion of a new building by Eric Owen Moss?
From the roof of the Samitaur Building, the most recent project by this brilliant 52-year-old Los Angeles architect, you can spot Fedco and other stores in the South-Central section that were looted during the 1992 riots after the verdict in the Rodney King beating. Then, plumes of smoke curled toward the sky as dusk crept over the city, and across the country, people were glued to their television screens trying to figure out what was going on. 
 Today, at the corner of Corbett Street and Jefferson Boulevard, it's clear that at least three things are going on. Samitaur is a football-field-length office building dramatically raised 21 feet off the ground by a long row of round steel columns. Beyond that, the building is a vote of confidence by Frederick Smith, the developer, in a part of town that has become synonymous with urban unrest. And not least, it's a prototype for an ambitious idea that Moss and Smith have been promoting for several years: a half-mile urban-renewal project designed to boost the civic profile of South-Central.
A.R. City (for Air Rights City), as the plan is called, would make use of the space (air rights) above an abandoned spur of the Southern Pacific Railroad that loops through Culver City along the edge of South-Central. The spur was originally built to pick up freight from manufacturers once clustered in this district of low-rise industrial sheds. Now, the spur serves mainly as a reminder that industry has dispersed, much of it gone overseas in search of cheap labor. And the rail cut itself stands as a symbol of the economic disparities that divide this city.
Moss's A.R. City plan is designed to mend the tear in the urban fabric and also to reverse the area's economic decline. The rail cut would be converted into a linear park with trees, seating, pedestrian walkways and recreational areas. The strip would be punctuated by buildings raised over it on steel trusses. These would house theaters and other cultural organizations as well as commercial tenants. Combining elements of the traditional urban park with the suburban industrial park, A.R. City would be, in effect, a post-industrial park for a forward-looking city.
The Samitaur (named after his development company) could be a prototype for the kinds of buildings Mr. Smith envisions. Situated a few blocks from the rail spur, it hovers over a driveway that runs between a warehouse with corrugated metal walls and a squat brick building that once housed machine shops. It was designed to foster the coexistence of light industry with upscale enterprises -- design studios, small movie-production companies -- that have gravitated to Culver City in recent years. In theory, the purpose of raising the building was to let trucks continue to service the industrial tenants. But these tenants have gone and given the present economy, it is likely that offices will eventually be housed in the building's ground-floor spaces.
 MOSS'S MAIN GOAL, however, in raising the building was to provide visual excitement. Many of his most important projects are interior renovations. While stunningly inventive, they are often invisible from the street. At Samitaur, Moss lifts his architecture emphatically into the public domain. And the building's muscular upward push is part of the message Moss wants to share.
The long, bar-shaped building, connected at one end to a renovated industrial shed, has stucco walls the color of weathered copper. A grid of thin steel strips divides the stucco into square panels, enlivening the flat surface with glints of silvery light. Square, punched-out windows echo the grid.
On the street side of the building, an outdoor staircase is molded into a flamboyant whirl of plastic form; Moss calls it "the pumpkin." The teethlike cut of the stairs, the empty window sockets, evoke a jack-o'-lantern visage. The top of the pumpkin is carved into a bowl shape with a rim that frames a disk of southern California sky. When a plane flies overhead, bisecting the disk, it's a reminder that this is a legendary city of people who came hoping to find things looking up.
Halfway down the building's length, there's another boldly articulated stair. Here, water will splash down from the roof into a pool, while an opening in the wall reveals an urban panorama surprisingly like a seascape: the rounded roofs of the disheveled old factories appear to roll toward the Samitaur like waves of rust.
The Samitaur will make an excellent landmark; but a half-mile-long loop of city laid out by Eric Owen Moss? Isn't that just another architect's wild utopian dream? Is it even desirable? Like it or not, the dream isn't that farfetched. Smith and Moss have already remade a number of old factory sheds along National Boulevard in Culver City. Besides reversing a declining part of the city, their efforts have produced some of the most vigorous architecture of our time.
But does it portend anything affirmative for the residents of South-Central? Or would the invasion of upscale businesses into impoverished, predominantly black neighborhoods simply further displace an already marginalized population? I confess that Eric Moss's work inspires me with a sense of optimism that I can't justify by empirical evidence. Cleaner streets, a lower crime rate, a higher standard of living: there's no proof that design per se can improve an urban environment in material terms.
But are these the only, the best, standards with which to measure a building's impact? In his book "Emotional Intelligence," Daniel Goleman argues that optimism produces measurable rewards. It improves performance; it is contagious; it can make the difference between win or lose. Moss gives form to similar ideas. His optimism isn't naive.
The Samitaur does not turn away from its depressed surroundings. On the contrary, the design's emphasis on providing views of the city gives you a clear sense of where you are. And A.R. City depicts no serenely humming modern Utopia. The plan's fragmented, incrementally pieced-together cityscape doesn't exclude uncertainty, or even doubt. But it pushes past ambivalence. It suggests that a picture of hope may be harder to construct than an image of despair, but that the ingredients for both are in sight.
Goleman hopes that one day schools will offer courses in emotional intelligence. Moss's projects strike me as such a form of education. The knowing spontaneity of his forms, the hands-on approach implicit in their strong, sculptural contours, the relationship they describe between a city's vitality and the creative potential of its individuals: these coalesce into tangible lessons about how a city should face its future.

 CORRECTION:
An article on Oct. 15 about a Los Angeles urban renewal project known as A.R. City and about one of its components, the Samitaur Building, misstated their locations within the city. The project is intended for an area of Culver City adjacent to Baldwin Hills, not for South-Central. The Samitaur Building is situated in an unnamed district of Los Angeles between Culver City and Baldwin Hills, a site of riots after the Rodney King verdict in 1992 -- also not in South-Central.

HEADLINE: The Reopening of the Frontier

BYLINE: By JON MARGOLIS; Jon Margolis is a former national political correspondent for The Chicago Tribune and now lives in Vermont.

 BODY:
JOHN MURPHY'S GRANDFATHER HELPED CONQUER the frontier.
That earlier John Murphy had tree-claimed -- planted 10 acres of trees in return for 160 acres of North Dakota farmland -- in 1882, two years after the United States Census counted 37 people in Foster County, not even 1 for each 10 of its 450 square miles. 
 That made it "unsettled." By the census bureau's reckoning, Foster County needed 900 folks to even be considered a "frontier settlement," and it needed 2,700 -- 6 per square mile -- to emerge from frontier status altogether. It got there by 1900, 29 years before the present John Murphy was born on that same farm, outside what had become the thriving village of Bordulac, N.D.
"I went to school right here," says Murphy. He was driving a visitor out to his farm, slowing down as he approached what remains of the settlement -- a grain elevator, a small bar and a few white frame homes. "We had our own school district, all the way through high school. By then, my father had the farm, and it was a few hundred acres."
It's now a few thousand acres and there are no schools in Bordulac and no businesses except a grain elevator and a small bar. Murphy turned 1 year old when Foster County's population peaked at 6,353 in 1930. It's been going down ever since, to 3,983 in 1990 -- 8.6 per square mile and falling. Simply put, the frontier is coming back.
While hardly anyone was paying attention, something quite extraordinary happened to a huge swath of the United States: it emptied out. In five states of the Great Plains, there are more counties with fewer than six persons per square mile than there were in 1920. In Kansas, such counties cover more territory than they did in 1890, when the census inspired Frederick Jackson Turner's celebrated and controversial essay about the passing of the frontier. Even the number of counties with fewer than two persons per square mile is on the rise. There were six such counties in North Dakota in 1990; some experts think there may be as many as 20 in the year 2000.
What remains of human settlement in the rural Great Plains is a Federal welfare project, sustained by Government farm programs and even more by Social Security and Medicare. This is the country of lonely old women, the widows who don't want to move South and whose children have gone elsewhere to find jobs. There are small towns in western Kansas, in the Dakotas and in the Oklahoma panhandle where nothing thrives except the drugstore and the clinic, if there is one. Or maybe an "antiques" shop where the merchandise is really the detritus of several attics, and the proprietors are an elderly couple who don't have anything better to do.
White settlers defeated -- all but extinguished -- the wilderness, the American Indians and the buffalo. Now the descendants of those conquerors find themselves besieged by an unusual alliance -- nature and technology.
"A hundred-sixty acres was never big enough for this country, even back then," Murphy says. He is driving just past his farm now, along broad, level fields newly seeded with spring wheat, the earth still black with an occasional hint of light-green fuzz. Beyond the fields is a line of trees, their darker green leaves almost gray under a dreary sky. Beyond the timberline are more fields, stretching farther than the eye can see. Whatever this country may be short of, it is not space.
What it is often short of is moisture. This is east of the hundredth meridian, but just barely, and annual rainfall is not much above the semiarid level. "With the machinery we have today, the chemicals and all, even 1,000 acres is really too small," Murphy says. "You need a sizable operation these days just to pay for the machinery you need to farm all that land."
So every year there are fewer farmers, meaning fewer customers for the local stores, hence fewer stores and fewer towns. Bordulac is gone and Barlow, up in the northwest corner of the county, is going. As he explains this, Murphy drives past an abandoned farmstead. At first glance, it looks like a silhouette against the gray sky. That there are only a handful of such relics does not mean that the farms are thriving; it means local folks scavenge the lumber.
"THERE USED TO BE 27 BUSINESSES HERE," SAYS PAUL KLINDWORTH. He sits behind the counter of a little grocery store that he manages, one of the last three businesses left in Hamberg. "I have a picture of all the businesspeople here somewhere. I could show you."
But he doesn't seem anxious to rise from his chair; there is something about Hamberg that breeds torpor. This is a frontier outpost that has fallen, but in this different kind of war the vanquished are permitted to live on in occupied territory. Three of the remaining residents are Klindworths and four are Schneiders, including two of Mrs. Sylling's grandchildren, who go to school in Maddock, some 20 miles up the road in the next county. It takes them "close to an hour" each way, she says.
"But there used to be a school here. There it is up on the hill. This used to be quite a town."
Whether Hamberg was ever quite a town is a question of taste. It was at its largest -- 187 souls -- in the 1920 census. That there was a school of some substance is unmistakable. Its remains are indeed visible up on the hill, bestriding it in graceful but forlorn grandeur. At one time, the school dominated the town, a symbol of the people's faith in the future. In a sense, it dominates the town still.
In fact, there is nothing unusual in Hamberg about abandoned buildings. That's most of what Hamberg is. More than half of the 30 or so houses stand empty, most for so long that they are now uninhabitable. They stand, many of them, behind lilac bushes on the few flat, wide streets of the town.
"Bozo owns lots of them," Klindworth says. "He owns the school, too, just for the lumber. He doesn't want to sell any of these places. Bozo, he gets something old, a house or a car, he just doesn't want to sell it." Bozo, Klindworth explains, is his brother Clarence, the owner of Earl's Bar, one of the other two businesses in town. The third is the meat locker owned by Mrs. Sylling's son-in-law.
Clarence Klindworth was not around to explain why he would not sell any of his houses, nor to explain why, at age 66, he has recently started to go dancing, at least according to Mrs. Sylling, a widow of about the same age. He has not, she says, gone dancing with her. "I'm too old," she says, implying with little subtlety that she thought he was, too. Whether this is self-knowledge or resentment at not being invited is no doubt a subject of some discussion in town, but it cannot be conclusively determined here, and neither Clarence Klindworth nor Earl's Bar has a telephone. Clearly, though, Klindworth does not see much need to try to revive Hamberg. Neither does Orella Sylling.
"It's great here," she says. She works part time at the post office, and while she acknowledges that she doesn't have much of a social life, she does have a superb garden -- corn, beans, radishes, beets and onions -- and the garden, her yard and her grandchildren keep her busy.
"This place is big enough for me," she says. "I would have liked to live all my life on a farm. I could never live in a bigger town."
Not to worry. What is happening in Hamberg and scores of small Plains towns is nothing less than the unsettling of the West or at least part of it, the reversal of that process so central to a thousand movies and the nation's sense of itself. Besides economic growth and technological progress in this country, the winning of the West symbolizes the nation's expansive optimism and its commitment to civilized order.
Maybe the country will have to reassess itself. Depopulation of the rural Great Plains has been going on for decades. Now begins its endgame -- the disintegration of local institutions. Even towns bigger than Hamberg are withering, and rural counties are becoming too empty to continue as separate entities. If enough of them become that empty, at some point someone will ask this question: Is North Dakota necessary?
 "IT ISN'T A STUPID QUESTION," SAYS RICHARD RATHGE, THE director of the North Dakota State Data Center in Fargo. Not that it's likely to happen, Rathge insists. But it has been discussed.
How could it not be? Rathge's center projects that by 2010 there will be about 627,000 North Dakotans, some 9,000 fewer than there are now, despite healthy growth in the Red River Valley (Fargo and Grand Forks), which are not really part of the Great Plains, and stability in Minot and Bismarck. So the rural areas will become even emptier.
Rathge's numbers might be optimistic. He assumes that the state's two air bases will survive and that some new business ventures will succeed. Make just a few pessimistic assumptions and what looms in 2010 is a state of fewer than 600,000. That's bigger than Wyoming or Vermont and not much smaller than South Dakota. But those states are growing. And they are growing in more than one region; even South Dakota has a thriving metropolis at each end -- spiffy Sioux Falls in the east and funky Rapid City in the west. If North Dakota loses many more rural residents, almost half the population would live in the state's eastern fringe. Much of the other half would be in Minot, if the air base does not fall victim to world peace, and around Bismarck, but only because the state government is there.
So who needs a state government? What about having one Dakota? Or how about letting Minnesota annex the Red River Valley -- culturally it's Minnesotan anyway -- and let the other neighbors divide the hinterlands?
Better yet, spin off the sparsely settled stretches of both Dakotas and Nebraska and Kansas, along with the equally empty eastern stretches of Montana, Wyoming and Colorado, and let it all revert to territorial status. Now there's a step that would neatly symbolize the victory of the new frontier and the inversion of the winning of the West -- decommission a state or two and make some of the continental United States a territory again.
Ed Schafer has heard this discussion before. He sips from his can of Coke, smiles a bit quizzically and while he calmly explains why he does not think this will happen, he does not argue that it is impossible. This is not without significance because Schafer is the Governor of North Dakota, and governors are not accustomed to discussing the possible demise of their states.
"Well, what's the appropriate time?" he asks. "I refuse to design a government here for the option of people giving up. To throw in the towel and say, 'Let's design a government that works for 600,000 people and forget it.' Our role is to provide the atmosphere and the arena of performance so that people live and work here."
The Governor, a Republican of the moderate school, can discuss the dismantling of his state with a certain detachment because it is hardly imminent. In fact, it's all quite unlikely. Under the Constitution, abolition requires a vote by a state's legislators, who would thus be voting themselves out of a job. This is not the customary behavior of state legislators. As a formal entity, North Dakota is probably safe. As a society, it could die.
OF COURSE, THAT WON'T HAPPEN IF FOSTER COUNTY AND places like it start growing again, which is what will happen if John Murphy has anything to say about it. He does. He's the chairman of the County Commissioners, and from his office in the stately domed county courthouse in Carrington, he acts as commanding officer of the cavalry that is fighting the latest and probably last American frontier war.
If Foster County can't prevail, it's hard to think of a rural county on the Great Plains that can. Compared with most others, Foster County has a lot going for it -- energetic young people, a modern hospital and a new motel. And thanks to an intense local effort that Murphy helped orchestrate, Carrington is home to the Dakota Growers Pasta Company mill, a $40 million hunk of concrete, pipes, oven dryers, computers and 200 employees.
This, according to the experts, is exactly what North Dakota needs. It's "economic development," it's "diversification" and it's "value-added," the new buzzwords of the West. Why should rural areas just raise the raw material for others to process? If they could process it right at the source, they'd keep the jobs and the money here, and that would save the region.
Up to a point, John Gardner agrees.
"The pasta plant fits into the region and its role," he says. "We grow food."
Gardner is another officer in the army of the frontier. He and his wife, Julie, live in the Putnam House, which they bought in 1991 for $52,000. It sits right on Main Street, commanding the city's portals, a huge American four-square with pillars. T.N. Putnam, a founding father of the town, built it in 1907. A few years ago, somebody was going to take it away, jack it up on a truck and haul it to Jamestown, about 45 miles away.
"This was in the late 80's, at the depths of disillusionment around here," Gardner says. "Taking that house would have taken something significant from the town."
He's an agricultural scientist, the director of the North Dakota State University Research Extension Center in Carrington. That's where John Murphy and a group of other energetic folks first met to plan their campaign to attract the pasta mill.
Gardner was all for it. "It was good for the local economy," he says, "and it was good for the people to do it." Three big corporations make most of America's domestic pasta. "To challenge that structure, that's empowering."
To Gardner, the process was as important as the jobs it produced. He's all for economic development, diversification and value-added. He knows they are necessary. But he knows they are not enough.
It's a message that is starting to be accepted, grudgingly, in these parts.
"THIS LITTLE TOWN ISN'T IN SUCH BAD SHAPE," JOHN MURPHY says. He is guiding his 1979 Buick up Carrington's wide, straight Main Street to the grain elevator, three gray towers with reddish-orange and rust-brown piping crisscrossing among them. The elevator is where Main Street crosses the railroad tracks. The other, smaller businesses lie mostly to the east.
"You see, all these stores are occupied," Murphy says. "It wasn't like that a few years ago. The farm economy had been depressed and that attitude, it gets a little bit contagious. Getting that pasta mill, that changed the whole mental attitude around here."
Sounds easy. Attract a new plant, perk up the town and revive the rural Great Plains. As it turns out, it isn't that easy, and the very fact that some people think otherwise shows that old fantasies die hard.
This region has long been plagued by the delusion that some economic miracle would transform the rural West into a garden. Once, people here were convinced that "rain follows the plow," as though cultivating the land would seed the clouds. There are still some who believe that the small farm can revive, or that coal and oil deposits in the western Dakotas will attract thousands, or that "telecommunications" (the folks who call you up during dinner to sell you another credit card) will save the prairies.
But it doesn't add up. It was admirable the way everyone in Carrington worked to attract the pasta co-op. It would be nice to conclude that it will keep Foster County from sinking below frontier-level population density. It might. Most likely it won't.
First of all, the plant could fail. "This is the best start-up I've ever been involved in," says Tim Dodd, who runs the Dakota Growers Pasta Company. But he is under no illusions. "We feel like we're going to succeed. But like any new company, there's risk involved."
Let's say it succeeds, grows, has 250 or 300 employees in another five years. That's what Rathge assumed when he made a population projection for Foster County, and he projected more decline -- from the 1990 figure of 3,983 to 3,165 in 2010, or just about 7 people per square mile.
And this is just one county. Are there enough value-added enterprises to turn around the population decline in 40 rural counties?
"No, I'm afraid not," says Larry Leistritz, an agricultural economist at North Dakota State University in Fargo. Leistritz is a firm believer in value-added cooperatives. He's helping start them. He knows they aren't enough.
That's because all these local efforts cannot outweigh the national and global factors that will hurt the region. Lower farm subsidies, for instance. The great farmland would not be harmed. But most of that is in Illinois or eastern Iowa. "A lot of the Great Plains is on the margin of whether you want to farm it or not," Leistritz says. "We probably plowed up a lot of land that never should have been plowed."
A result of the impending reductions in Federal farm subsidies is that some marginal land will be converted from grain to grazing. So what happens to the land now used for grazing? "Central Wyoming," Leistritz says, "probably gets left to the antelope."
Central Wyoming and perhaps a bit of Kansas, Nebraska and the Dakotas. Maybe the Great Plains were simply destined to become emptier. Maybe Frank and Deborah Popper had a point when they wrote that depopulation should be encouraged so that the area could be transformed into a national eco-park, a "buffalo commons," a term that still enrages Dakotans even though the Poppers have amended their proposal. No one has yet suggested giving the Plains back to the Indians. But it's a thought.
Or maybe there's one other possibility, a kind of economic development that is not economic development as the term is usually understood.
WHEN JOHN AND JULIE Gardner bought the Putnam House, they didn't live in it. They made it the headquarters of a nonprofit local cultural society, with the idea that the group would buy it. (It never did -- the cultural society decided that buying the house would be too risky.) There were concerts, recitals, art exhibitions and literary discussions, and in a town with no bookstore or art gallery, the cultural society was a hit. It still is, even though the Gardners now live in the house.
 No, the Gardners do not expect Carrington to turn into the Athens of the Plains. But they do suspect that their frontier war will be won, if at all, as much by culture as by cultivation. This might seem absurd. But it's less absurd than believing that a few pasta plants will repopulate the prairie.
The Gardners and some others have figured out that the people who are here will stay and that others will come only if they want to; that what the Great Plains really have to offer is something intangible. It isn't that grain and pasta are unimportant. It's that agriculture is more than just growing crops. "A farm community," Gardner says, "is both -- farms and a community."
And the real attraction, he says, is "the landscape, the social structure, the way of life. Those are the things that make people want to live here." Value-added and economic development are not the modern versions of rain follows the plow. They are necessary, as are the lignite coal and the oil in western North Dakota and the telecommunications companies that have brought a few thousand jobs to the state.
But they aren't enough. Taken together, they can't make up for all the jobs lost by farm consolidation and labor-saving technology. People will return to the rural Great Plains only if they want to live here.
Here? Where it's 100 degrees in July and 30 below in January? Where there is neither a mountain range nor a forest worthy of the name, in the only state along the nation's northern border that lacks a trout stream? This is not, as Richard Rathge puts it, one of the "amenity areas." The people who can work at home with a modem, or who can run a small company out of a little building anywhere that has a good phone hookup -- they aren't coming here. They're going to Montana, the Ozarks, the Carolinas or northern New England. Who would come here?
Well, maybe you would. Think about it for a minute, some of you who live in places that are too crowded. There are places that are too empty. America could use some population redistribution. Consider the possibility that you are a Plains person.
Start your own trend -- rural North Dakota chic. For about $40,000 you can buy a very nice house in Carrington. Drive 13 miles west to Sykeston and there's a beauty for $16,000. Or try Hamberg. Get three or four friends or relatives, talk Bozo into selling and buy up half the town. Then you won't be lonely. And at those prices, you'd have plenty of money left for a big satellite dish and high-resolution television, for occasional trips to places where you could see a big-league ball game, a good show and a restaurant meal that was not a hunk of beef. The infrastructure is there. North Dakota has all the latest wiring and switches, not to mention good roads.
What would you get? Clean air, good schools, no crime, no traffic jams, people who are so friendly that it takes some getting used to. A life surrounded by austere and haunting beauty. A sense of tradition, here in the state where Teddy Roosevelt discovered the West, here in the home of great Americans -- Eric Sevareid, Lawrence Welk, Roger Maris.
You'd get space, endless acres of rolling prairie, on which wheat is grown, livestock graze and deer abound. Where ducks by the tens of thousands nest in sloughs in the spring, where they and the snow geese fly overhead in the fall. They are shootable, by shotgun for a month in autumn, by lens all year long.
 O.K., THE BEAUTY OF THE PLAINS IS AN ACQUIRED TASTE. "We lack a certain charisma," Leistritz admits. At first, the prairie may seem flat and monotonous. But look again. It undulates. Yes, all is green in the spring and brown in the winter, but those are different shades of green and brown, as there are different species of swallow and owl, duck and goose. More closely examined, this is a land rich in natural variety.
Human variety, too. More than anything else, what the immigrant to the rural Great Plains would gain is a certain sense of community, the kind that is fading elsewhere, the kind in which you have to participate. "At first, it might seem a bit stark," Gardner says. "But the winters here are a wonderful time for creativity, for introspection, for getting to know people."
And whether or not your friends followed you, you would be on the cutting edge of a trend. Because as it turns out, rural North Dakota is not the only place trying to deal with the transformation of an economy, and a society, in which producing material necessities has become insufficient for prosperity. Wheat farmers are no different from auto workers, loggers and mill hands. The world simply does not need as many of them as it once did.
No, the Great Plains are not alone in facing this change. It's just that the choices are a bit starker out here, making it harder to hide from the realities. Maybe rural North Dakota is as good a harbinger of the future -- its dangers and promise -- as you can find.
It's . . . well, it's a whole new frontier.

HEADLINE: In Arizona Politics, a Personal Fiscal Crisis

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE 

DATELINE: PHOENIX, Oct. 14

 BODY:
Despite his name, J. Fife Symington 3d, and his social pedigree as a great-grandson of the New York coal baron Henry Clay Frick, the saga of Arizona's Governor sounds more like South America than Southwest United States.
In September, a few weeks after celebrating his 50th birthday in London and Paris, Governor Symington came home to this desert capital to declare that he was unable to pay nearly $25 million in debts. 
 The legendary optimism and bounce of this strawberry blond Republican may falter on Oct. 31, the day lawyers for creditors are to grill him in Federal Bankruptcy Court here. In applying for personal bankruptcy, Governor Symington, a former real estate developer, listed only $61,795 in assets that could be used to liquidate debts of $24,788,325.
Although Mr. Symington is believed to be the first governor in this century to file for bankruptcy, the petition is not denting his upper-class style of living. Creditors are not expected to be able to attach the roughly $30,000 a year he earns from trusts set up for descendants of Mr. Frick, an industrialist best known to New Yorkers for endowing the Frick Collection, the art museum on Manhattan's East Side.
Equally untouchable, is the wealth of the Governor's wife, Ann Olin Pritzlaff Symington, a granddaughter of the founder of a chemical conglomerate now known as the Olin Corporation. A prenuptial agreement negotiated 20 years ago kept the Symingtons' money separate.
"About all they own together is a television," said a lawyer here for the Governor.
But, while Mr. Symington may absolve himself of all responsibilities for his debts in the court of law, he may not fare so well in the court of public opinion.
"Symington can stiff-upper-lip this one all he wants," said Earl de Berge, a veteran Arizona pollster. "Politicians can recover from blunders, from stupidity. But the one thing that is extremely difficult to recover from is breach of trust."
The bankruptcy filing was unethical, said 48 percent of voters polled by Mr. de Berge's company, the Behavior Research Center.
But down at the Mercado, a shopping mall that is one of the Governor's many failed ventures, Kare Lockhart, owner of the Frontier Boot Corral, predicted on Friday that voters would soon forget it all: "In three years, this will be done and gone. In three years, chances are that he will be re-elected."
In recent years, Arizonans have witnessed a series of corruption scandals and political embarrassments.
The national savings and loans collapse of the late 1980's is symbolized today by Charles A. Keating, a Phoenix banker who is now in jail. In the early 1990's, seven state legislators were convicted of charges stemming from payments made by an agent posing as a crooked lobbyist.
In 1988, Gov. Evan Mecham was removed from office after he provoked a nationwide boycott of Arizona by opposing a state holiday for the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.
Mr. Symington was elected in 1991 on a platform that touted the sharp business acumen of a developer who had weathered the state's real estate collapse of the late 1980's.
The Governor has proved to be an enthusiastic free marketeer, cutting taxes and spending. He has chastised welfare mothers and divorced fathers who fall behind on child support payments.
The bankruptcy has provoked sharp debate in the letters and editorial columns of The Arizona Republic, the leading statewide newspaper.
"What's the difference between an unwed mother filing for welfare and Gov. Fife Symington filing for Chapter 7 bankruptcy?" asked a letter writer, Robert Gregory of Phoenix.
Class and regional undertones sharpen the debate. His listing in the Social Register notes that he was born in New York and graduated from Harvard in 1968. The Governor is a distant relative of the late Senator Stuart Symington of Missouri. To finance the Mercado, he borrowed $10 million from union pension funds, largely those of Arizona blue collar workers like carpenters and masons.
"Symington, whose lineage includes millionaires of days gone by, is married to a business heiress, has sent his children to the most elite schools in the Valley, and now expects the Arizona public to believe that his assets total $61,000," wrote Cassio Saverino, of Peoria, Ariz.
But other Arizonans defended their Governor, saying his 13 failed projects here were only part of a wider economic hurricane that swept real estate markets in the region in the late 1980's.
"Nobody put a gun to the heads of the clowns running the pension funds who got greedy," wrote Neil C. Alden of Phoenix in another letter to the Republic. "Their speculative investment went sour."
The Governor, who did not respond to interview requests last week, has said that his bankruptcy has placed him in the company of other leaders who endured financial setbacks, including Thomas Jefferson and Harry Truman.
Some political analysts say the Governor timed his bankruptcy filing -- nine months into his second term -- in order to get it over with in time for a re-election bid in 1998.
But with 75 creditors gearing up for a protracted bankruptcy fight, it is unclear how many voters will agree in 1998 with his 1994 slogan: "I like Fife."
The filing is expected to give new life to a Federal grand jury that since 1991 has been interviewing lawyers, accountants, and bankers about Mr. Symington's business activities.
According to Phoenix newspapers, investigators are trying to determine if the Governor used state contracts and state jobs to defray personal legal and accounting expenses.
In addition, the grand jury is reportedly investigating whether Mr. Symington committed a felony by submitting false financial statements when seeking bank loans.
According to these statements, Mr. Symington suffered a one-year, $35 million negative swing in his personal finances. In June 1990, Mr. Symington said he had a net worth of $12 million. In May 1991, he said he was $23 million in the red.
Lawyers for creditors also want to know if he made illegal property transfers to his family before filing for bankruptcy. In a May 1990 financial statement, Mr. Symington said that he owned $250,000 worth of "art, jewelry, silver and antiques."
Last month, in his bankruptcy petition, he listed only a $100 watch and a $500 wedding ring. Both were listed as "exempt" from creditors.

HEADLINE: Clinton Asks Men to Pledge Not to Strike Women

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 15

 BODY:
President Clinton called on the nation's men on Saturday to pledge to "never, never lift a hand against a woman for as long as we live."
Mr. Clinton, who as a youngster once stopped his stepfather from beating his mother, appealed "not just as a President, or a father or a husband, but also as a son who has seen domestic violence first hand." 
 The President, in his weekly radio address, said the Republican-controlled Congress was bent on reducing the Government's domestic-violence programs by $50 million, hampering "our efforts to protect battered women and their children, to preserve families and to punish these crimes."
Mr. Clinton's overall message appeared aimed at people upset at O. J. Simpson's acquittal last week on charges of murdering his former wife and her friend. Mr. Simpson has admitted battering Mrs. Simpson.
On Monday, in a speech at the University of Texas in Austin, Mr. Clinton is set to address the racial divisions highlighted by the Simpson trial.
The speech coincides not only with the debate over the Simpson verdict but with Monday's rally of black men in Washington.
"I imagine he will address the need to bring Americans together and to shun those who advocate hate," said Michael D. McCurry, the White House press secretary.
Delivering the weekly Republican radio address, Senator Pete Domenici of New Mexico took exception to Mr. Clinton's criticism of Republican budget cuts.
"America's budget deficit is growing at a rate of $482 million a day, but President Clinton won't support the balanced budget plan because he says balancing the budget in seven years is too fast," Mr. Domenici said. "It's not too fast for the unemployed, or underemployed, who can't get good work because of the deficit's stifling effect on job creation."
In his own radio address, Mr. Clinton noted that his Administration's crime bill, voted into law last year, also included the Violence Against Women Act, which he said combined sanctions against abusers with aid to the police, prosecutors and shelters.
But he said government alone could not prevail.
"The real solution to this problem starts with us, with our personal responsibility and a simple pledge that we will never, never lift a hand against a woman for as long as we live," the President said.
Mr. Clinton is traveling extensively this week, with speeches and campaign fund-raising events in Connecticut, Texas, California, Ohio and Iowa. On Saturday, he flies to New York to address the United Nations General Assembly and to meet privately with other world leaders.

HEADLINE: Company Takes Over Unloading At Market

BYLINE: By SELWYN RAAB 

 BODY:
With a dozen displaced workers looking on angrily, and under a heavy police guard, a newly hired company began unloading fish and seafood last night in the latest phase of the city's campaign to rid the Fulton Fish Market of organized crime.
Before the first arriving cargo of halibut, swordfish and flounder was unloaded, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani made a brief walking tour through the market. He said the changes in the unloading practices there were "a new beginning" in improving business conditions at the market in lower Manhattan. 
 "This is going to be a real improvement in the right direction for an important part of New York City," the Mayor said. "It is the right thing to do and something that should have been done 20 or 30 years ago."
Within several hours last night, long unloading delays occurred. Drivers of refrigerated trucks that deliver the produce from the Atlantic and Gulf coasts said they had never previously seen such delays. The trucks were lined up on South Street for about a quarter of a mile.
The Fulton Fish Market, the nation's largest wholesale seafood distribution center, is an important cog in the city's economy. It generates about $1 billion a year in sales, salaries and other business dealings.
On Friday, the city awarded a two-year unloading contract to the Laro Maintenance Company of Bay Shore, L.I., a company with no experience in the seafood distribution business. Laro has been involved mainly in cleaning office buildings, airports and the Statue of Liberty.
Laro's owner, Robert Bertuglia Jr., said last night's delays were understandable. "The other companies have been here 70 years," he said. "Give us seven days and I promise you a cleaner and better market."
Under the agreement with the city, Laro will unload refrigerator trucks on a first-come, first-served basis.
The six companies that were ousted on Friday and replaced by Laro were known as unloaders. For 60 years, they had been the self-appointed companies to unload cargo at the market. They charged wholesale dealers about $2 million a year. The displaced companies also had territorial rights and determined among themselves the order of unloading.
Because fish is a perishable product, the companies, according to city officials and Federal investigators, have had an economic stranglehold on the flow of supplies into the market. City officials said Laro would cut unloading costs by about 20 percent.
At 7:50 P.M., 50 Laro employees began unloading the first tractor-trailor. The truck came from the Tidewater area of Virginia with a cargo of swordfish, halibut and flounder.
At the market's main arrival point, Peck Slip and South Street, Laro crews in red and orange jumpsuits swarmed around the truck and unloaded the fish by hand onto wooden pallets. The produce was then transported on forklifts to the merchants' stalls a short distance away.
Trucks from Poppin, Wis., and Riverhead, L.I., were the next to be relieved of their fish and seafood cargo.
John Gillio, the owner of Jet Unloaders Inc., standing behind the police barricade on South Street, looked on with a grim expression. "They've taken away my business and heritage," he said. "My family has been here 60 years, and Giuliani, overnight, has reduced us to nothing. I never gave a dime to anyone in organized crime, I worked too hard for my money down here."

HEADLINE: Newspapers Cut Spanish-Language Publications

BYLINE: By ALLEN R. MYERSON 

 BODY:
In the last few years, the surge in the country's Hispanic population and the success of Spanish-language radio and television have caused newspaper publishers across the nation to try to cash in. Start new Spanish supplements and Spanish editions, they ordered. Then they sat back to wait for the advertisements and dollars to roll in.
Que horror! The expected Hispanic readers never turned off their radios and televisions, advertisers never arrived and shareholders of the newspaper companies wanted to know why cash was pouring out, not in. Now the publishers are shutting their new sections or at least cutting them back. 
 In Los Angeles, Fort Worth and Chicago, newspapers have reversed course. And on Friday, The Daily News of New York confirmed that it too might close its bilingual newspaper, El Daily News, just four months after introducing it.
Across the nation, profit projections based on the surge in Hispanic buying power and notions about community service have confronted the realities of heavy competition from radio and television, rising newsprint costs and restive shareholders.
Initially, said Gilbert H. Bailon, president of the National Association of Hispanic Journalists and an editor at The Dallas Morning News, "people wanted to do it because they wanted to provide coverage for a community," confident that Spanish-language sections would win profits and praise. "Now," he added, "the bottom line is becoming more difficult."
Two years ago, The Los Angeles Times expanded Nuestro Tiempo, its Spanish-language supplement that had come out 15 times a year, and began publishing 400,000 copies weekly. "This exciting new publication expands our efforts in the largely bilingual and Spanish-speaking segment of the market," said David Laventhol, then the publisher of the Los Angeles Times, in his own newspaper.
Three months ago the paper announced the closing of Nuestro Tiempo. Though the Los Angeles area has a Hispanic population of about five million, at least two-thirds more than that in the New York area, the expanded section never gained enough advertisers to become profitable. After large shareholders of the newspaper's parent, the Times Mirror Company, brought in Mark H. Willes from General Mills as chief executive this year in an effort to generate higher returns, patience for Nuestro Tiempo and other money-losing newspaper operations quickly ran out.
In 1990, Times Mirror had hedged its bets by purchasing a 50 percent stake in the local competition, La Opinion, the nation's largest Spanish-language daily. Now Times Mirror will join with La Opinion to issue a less ambitious weekly section, Para Ti, with about half the circulation of Nuestro Tiempo, which will feature life-style articles instead of hard news. La Opinion will write and print the section, The Times will distribute it and both newspapers will sell advertisements.
Times Mirror is hardly alone. The Chicago Sun-Times has stopped distributing a separate Spanish newspaper with its Sunday issues. The Fort Worth Star-Telegram is scaling back the circulation of its weekly bilingual section, La Estrella, which was introduced last year. Even ventures as stable and successful as The Miami Herald's Spanish-language sibling, El Nuevo Herald, have had their staffs trimmed as part of broad campaigns to cut costs.
Heberto Gutierrez, president of Inventiva Inc., a leading Hispanic advertising agency based in San Antonio, said his clients looked to radio and, if they had the money, television. "You're going to go with what provides the biggest impact, which is sight, sound and action -- television and radio," he added in an interview.
Publishers having to cut back or close their Spanish-language supplements can only envy last year's 25.5 percent gain, to $454.2 million, in spending on television advertising aimed at the Hispanic market, as measured by Hispanic Business magazine. While most Spanish-language ventures by major newspapers were started in the last few years, the largest Hispanic markets had two or three television stations and half a dozen radio stations a decade ago. "They got there first," said Dick Tobin, president of Strategy Research, a marketing research company based in Miami.
La Estrella has been pruned to 12 pages from 16, and its circulation is being cut to about 115,000 from about 145,000. The Star-Telegram is owned by Capital Cities/ABC, which the Walt Disney Company has agreed to acquire.
There has been stiff competition in the print market from independent Spanish newspapers in many cities with large Hispanic populations. In New York, El Daily News has failed to break readers' loyalties to El Diario-La Prensa, the city's 82-year-old Spanish-language paper. Competition and distribution glitches have kept the circulation of El Daily News below 15,000, at least 10,000 lower than what the company, whose principal owner is Mortimer B. Zuckerman, had hoped for.
The Santa Barbara News-Press in California decided that its separate Spanish newspaper, El Nuevo Tiempo, which it began publishing in September 1993, could better survive independently, and it was sold in January. "The advertising revenue didn't materialize," said Raul Gil, El Nuevo Tiempo's former publisher. He cited a lack of newspaper readers in the relatively poor Hispanic community, a downturn in the region's economy and the small size of the Santa Barbara market. The News-Press is owned by The New York Times Company.
Although Miami Herald executives are discussing whether to expand El Nuevo Herald's circulation to the north, they meanwhile want to economize by cutting its news staff to 88 from 96. "Knight-Ridder is showing a good profit, the stock is up, but that doesn't mean The Miami Herald is allowed to burn up capital," said Mr. Tobin, the Miami market researcher. A new chief executive at Knight-Ridder Inc., the Herald's owner, has committed himself to raising profits and cutting costs.
Despite circulation that has stagnated over the last few years at about 101,000 daily and 126,000 on Sunday, El Nuevo Herald remains profitable. But Miami's Cuban community is more prosperous and better educated than the Hispanic populations in many other areas.

HEADLINE: Western Voices Break Into the Debate Over Sterling Forest

BYLINE: By IAN FISHER 

DATELINE: WARWICK, N.Y., Oct. 12

 BODY:
For more than a decade, there have been two competing visions for Sterling Forest, the privately owned woodland that blankets an area the size of Manhattan with hemlock and alder, providing a home to black bears and otters and even a few rare northern cricket frogs.
One vision calls for development, the other for preservation. 
 Now new voices, with a Western twang, have chimed in. A handful of Republican members of Congress, opponents of Washington's vast land holdings in their home states, say that any Federal role in preserving Sterling Forest as a two-state park -- as the Republican Governors of New York and New Jersey have requested -- is simply inappropriate.
"Do I have a basic philosophical dispute with this?" said Representative Helen Chenoweth, a freshman Republican from Idaho, where the Federal Government owns two-thirds of the land. "Yes."
In recent weeks, Ms. Chenoweth and other House Republicans, mostly freshmen from Western states, have said they oppose a plan, already passed in the Senate, to provide $17.5 million to help buy Sterling Forest from the Swiss insurance company that owns it. In budget-cutting times, they argue, the Federal Government owns too much land already, and poorly manages what it has.
If successful, their opposition could tilt the scales toward a plan by the forest's owners to build one of the largest planned communities in the Northeast: a project that would put homes for 35,000 people, golf courses and eight million square feet of commercial and industrial space in the 17,505-acre forest in Orange County, only 40 miles north of New York City.
The development plan, which would retain three-quarters of the forest as open space, has divided local residents, many of whom would welcome the economic boost such a large project would bring.
The opposition in Congress has worried Republican and Democratic officials in both states. The contention illustrates how the Republican Party can fragment along regional lines on environmental and other issues, like the proposal to distribute Medicaid money in a way that would benefit growing states in the West and South at the expense of the Northeast.
After testifying late last month before the House subcommittee where the opposition is centered, Bernadette Castro, a Republican and the Parks Commissioner in New York, said she was troubled by some members' doctrinaire opposition to the purchase.
"I think it's a political, philosophical issue with them and I'm trying to get them past that," said Ms. Castro. "They are freshmen and I don't think they understand the impact of a flippant decision they might make."
Representative Maurice D. Hinchey, a Democrat from upstate New York who is on the subcommittee for National Parks, Forests and Lands, agreed: "Particularly this new crop that was elected last year, somehow they have a very parochial view of the world. They have a very difficult time -- really a seeming inability -- to relate to the circumstances of other people in other parts of the country."
The special concerns of New York and New Jersey include preserving open space -- a commodity much more valued in the East than the West -- and protecting drinking water. New Jersey, which has already bought the 2,000 acres of Sterling Forest that laps into that state, wants to preserve the rest because drinking water for two million people comes from the Ramapo and Wanaque watersheds fed by streams there. Moreover, seven miles of the Appalachian Trial thread through the northern part of the forest.
The fight over Sterling Forest, once part of the huge holdings of the Harriman family, has picked up steam this year on several fronts: after taking office in January, Gov. George E. Pataki of New York, who grew up in nearby Peekskill and often hikes around the Hudson Highlands, came out strongly for preserving the forest, agreeing with a study that called the proposed development of 13,000 clustered homes in five hamlets "a good plan, but in the wrong place."
Then in June, Senator Bill Bradley, Democrat of New Jersey, forced the $17.5 million for the park purchase into a larger Senate bill on Alaskan land by threatening to bottleneck other bills before the Energy and Natural Resources Committee.
Meanwhile, New York has pledged $10 million, as a start toward the purchase, matched by $10 million from Gov. Christine Todd Whitman of New Jersey. Ms. Castro said she expects $5 million in private money, bringing the total near $45 million.
But even if the $17.5 million in Federal money stays in the final legislation, Ms. Castro acknowledges that there is no guarantee that the owners, the Zurich Insurance Group of Switzerland, would sell the forest for $45 million. Informal estimates of the land's value range from $50 million to $200 million -- an ambiguity that feeds the Western Republicans' opposition to spending Federal money on the proposed park.
"This is not a philosophical struggle," said Michael Hardiman, the spokesman for Representative Richard W. Pombo, a California Republican elected in 1992. "This is cold, hard common sense in management of Federal land."
Mr. Hardiman said his boss argues that the Federal Government already owns 700 million acres of land nationally, 55 percent of the total area in Oregon, for example. The Government has no business buying more parkland, he said, until it resolves struggles out West over how best to use land that many area residents feel should be in state or private hands.
"The Federal leviathan called the Interior Department is constantly seeking to expand its empire," he said. "We have got to revise Federal land management policies before we buy one more acre, aiming toward looking at what Federal land we have now, what can be sold to the private sector."
Other Republicans argue that Sterling Forest, where small areas have already been developed with a ski area and 300 houses, is not "nationally significant" enough to warrant spending Federal money. And some agree with the developers' contention that the proposed project would have little if any impact on the watersheds.
But Ms. Castro and New Jersey officials, along with the Congressional delegations of both states, are pressing their contention that preserving Sterling Forest is important and that the owners' willingness to sell, despite questions about price, offers a timely opportunity. Moreover, Ms. Castro said the park would require no Federal involvement beyond the initial financing: the park would be managed by the Palisades Interstate Park Commission, a bi-state agency chartered by Congress.
"My only concern is the ideological argument, because factually I think there is no argument," she said.
Despite the opposition in the House subcommittee, Congressional aides say the measure is far from dead, especially because Mr. Bradley appears to have made it a personal priority for his last term in office. "There might be a high price to pay for it, but if they are willing to pay that price, it might have a good chance," one aide said. "But it's going to be a tough sell."

HEADLINE: In Japan, Aid For Developing Chip of Future

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Oct. 15

 BODY:
In an effort to sharpen its competitiveness in electronics, Japan is planning a large Government-financed program to develop advanced techniques for manufacturing semiconductors, displays and computers, officials said on Friday.
The new effort, tentatively called the Super Advanced Electronics Technology program, will be financed initially by 10 billion yen, or $100 million, included in a package of measures announced last month to stimulate Japan's sagging economy. 
 The project is taking shape as Japan's manufacturers of semiconductors are feeling squeezed. South Korean companies have essentially caught up to Japan's electronic giants in their specialty, memory chips, while the United States has maintained a lead in microprocessors and other chips that do more advanced information processing tasks.
Japan has long been known for Government-backed efforts to move the nation into specific industries. In the 1970's, the VLSI Project -- it stands for very large system integration -- helped Japanese companies capture the world lead in the memory chip market.
But as Japan's electronics companies have become bigger and stronger and able to finance their own product development, the projects run by the Ministry of International Trade and Industry have shifted more toward basic research.
Katsuhiko Kaji, deputy director of the industrial electronics division at MITI, said the new project would work on basic materials and techniques that would be needed 10 years from now rather than on particular products.
These will include ways for making semiconductors with circuit patterns less than 0.1 micron in width, compared with several tenths of a micron in today's most advanced chips. The project also will work on techniques for measuring features that small. A micron is a millionth of a meter.
Mr. Kaji said a consortium of companies was expected to be set up next year to conduct the research. He said theministry wanted to continue the project for at least five years, but the annual financing probably would be far less than in the first year.
Mr. Kaji said the project might be open to some "competitive" non-Japanese companies, but added, "We will not welcome free riders."
In a separate development, 10 Japanese semiconductor companies are planning to work together to help introduce computer-chip manufacturing equipment that can handle silicon wafers that are 300 millimeters, or about 12 inches, in diameter.
The project would require 5 billion yen, or about $50 million, to start, and would need a budget of about $40 million a year, an industry official said, adding that there will be no Government financing.
Currently, chips are made from silicon wafers that are 200 millimeters, or 8 inches, in diameter. The change to 12-inch wafers, which is expected to take place toward the end of the decade, would allow far more chips to be made from a single wafer, cutting manufacturing costs.
The project is sponsored by the Semiconductor Industry Research Institute Japan, an organization formed last year by Japanese semiconductor companies to work on ways to increase the competitiveness of Japan's industry. The members of the institute include NEC, Toshiba, Hitachi and Fujitsu.
American companies, led by the Sematech consortium, are also planning a project to help develop manufacturing equipment for 12-inch wafers.
Taro Okabe, acting executive director of the Japanese institute, said there was a chance the two nations would cooperate.

HEADLINE: Mr. Chirac's Troubled Start

 BODY:
Jacques Chirac's presidency of France began last spring with a burst of energy and high public expectations. But the initial mood was deflated when the new Government could not deliver on its beguiling campaign promises of swift and painless economic revival. Mr. Chirac, whose term runs until 2002, still has plenty of time to turn things around. But he needs to begin making the tough economic policy decisions he evaded as a candidate and in his first few months.
Nobody, least of all someone with Mr. Chirac's long experience in government, should have believed it would be possible to slash unemployment, reduce taxes and sharply lower budget deficits all at the same time. The new Government tried to pursue these conflicting objectives, but the result has been a frustrating stalemate. 
 So the solid majority support Mr. Chirac enjoyed in May has evaporated. Prime Minister Alain Juppe has sunk even lower after barely escaping prosecution for providing his family with city-owned apartments at below-market rents in his former job as Deputy Mayor of Paris. The Juppes must vacate their apartments by the end of the year to avoid formal charges.
As Americans well know, politicians everywhere love to court voters with promises of tax cuts and balanced budgets. But when the same voters protest reductions in services and entitlements, politicians tend to back off, leaving deficit reduction for another day.
In France, however, such procrastination is no longer possible because of strict European Union requirements that France cut its budget deficit almost in half by 1997 to qualify for entry into the planned European Monetary Union. Joining the monetary union is the centerpiece of French European policy. But the deficit target cannot be met without unpopular cuts, unpopular tax hikes or both.
Two months ago, Finance Minister Alain Madelin proposed cutting civil service pensions and was forced to resign. More recently, Mr. Juppe announced a public-sector pay freeze, which was greeted last week by a national work stoppage. Unions also fiercely oppose any reduction in France's traditional five- to six-week annual vacation. The Government could strengthen its hand by pushing ahead with public-sector deregulation. But it hesitates, fearing a political backlash.
Similarly, unemployment, the most potent issue in French politics, cannot be greatly reduced without sacrifices by those now employed. In an integrated global economy, it is not possible to sustain uncompetitive wage and benefit levels without paying a huge price in deficits or jobs. Like his predecessor, Francois Mitterrand, Mr. Chirac is learning that France's ability to indulge in populist economics is sharply constrained by the more orthodox policies of its main European partners.
Mr. Chirac has a deserved reputation for obstinacy in day-to-day battles. But in his long career he has also demonstrated that he can learn from past mistakes and sharply change course when necessary. That is what he needs to do now.

HEADLINE: THE MARCH ON WASHINGTON: THE PARTICIPANTS;
A Bus to the Black March: 31 Men, Hope and History

BYLINE: MICHEL MARRIOTT 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 15

 BODY:
Somewhere along the gently rolling expanse of rural North Carolina today, a 430-horsepower workhorse of the open road plowed north on Interstate 85 and into a predawn darkness.
Inside this bus, while some tried to snooze away the miles, others tossed in their seats with restless anticipation. For most, the 12-hour journey from Atlanta to Washington was less to a place than to an appointment with black hope, history and renewal. 
 The busload of 31 black men, some graying and one not quite fully grown, were bound for Monday's Million Man March on the Mall. And that destination, simply that, infused nearly every gesture, expression and observation made along the trip, and, at times, the bus itself, with a deeply felt racial significance.
Jimmy Binion, who does engineering and design work for a telephone company in Atlanta, saw in the bus a symbolic response to the slave ships. Those vessels carried blacks, cramped and weary, to "negative" futures, he said, while today's ride was a "totally positive journey," with a cooler of soft drinks and trays of cold cuts to boot.
But when the bus, amply named "Go'in Places," finally pulled off the highway for a desperately needed breakfast stop at a roadside Shoney's restaurant, the decision swiftly led to a stern, yet good-natured, lecture on racial economics -- after most on the bus had wolfed down eggs, sausage, grits, gravy and fried potatoes.
"We just spent $150 in a white-owned establishment on our way to a march to protest about the economic conditions that we find ourselves in," the Rev. Ra Kabeer, a 52-year-old minister with the First African Presbyterian Church in Atlanta, said over the bus's public address system. The trip's organizer, Trina Ross, one of three black women making the trip but promising not to attend the all-male march, said the bus would stop at a black-owned restaurant on the return leg. Everyone appeared pleased.
Like Mr. Binion, who is 45, Mr. Kabeer felt himself to be on no ordinary ride. "We are here under the appointment of destiny," he said.
The march-bound bus was only one of thousands of scheduled busloads of black men that began arriving on Saturday in response to a call for a million men to join in a day of fasting, male bonding, soul-searching and atonement. Regional organizers of the march said many of the buses would be arriving on Monday just in time to drop passengers in the capital between midnight and 4 A.M. In addition, thousands more black men are expected to arrive here soon by air, vans and automobiles.
As preparations for the event neared completion, debate continued over the role of Louis Farrakhan, the leader of the Nation of Islam, who had issued the appeal.
But on this 40-foot-long, gray and lavender bus, little but praise was heard whenever Mr. Farrakhan's name was raised, as it often was.
"I've been following him for a long time, since I was 5 years old," said David LeGall, 35. "I would have to say he is the most inspirational, most educational teacher in the United States."
Shortly before the bus left the parking lot of the First African Presbyterian Church -- four hours late -- the men gathered in the two-story, brick and wood building and discussed Mr. Farrakhan, who is widely regarded as one of the most controversial black leaders in America.
Aboard this bus, there was little patience with the criticism that has come from many whites and some blacks about Mr. Farrakhan's role and his history of anti-Semitic and other inflammatory remarks.
That was not the picture they had of the man. The Rev. Mark Lomax, the soft-spoken pastor of the church, said he had met with Mr. Farrakhan, and 35 other religious leaders, a month ago in Atlanta and had been thoroughly impressed. "He is a prophet and he's down with the people," the Rev. Lomax said, adding, "We don't let our faith differences get in the way of our common agenda."
A common response for anyone who raised any questions about Mr. Farrakhan's role was that the march transcended any single man.
During today's trip, march-bound passengers packed into cars sometimes honked and waved in solidarity as they sped past the bus, which pleased L. Vernon Allwood, the director of community relations and special projects at the School of Medicine at Morehouse College. A veteran of the 1963 March on Washington, Mr. Allwood has been directing through churches 20-week manhood training sessions for black boys 12 to 14 years old. He echoed a call of the march in emphasizing that black men must take greater responsibility in raising families.
Between Arabic and Christian prayers, bouts of political debate and hours of reading pocket-sized copies of the Koran and the Bible, the ride rocked with old-fashioned fun.
"I didn't have any idea what to expect when I got on this bus," said Charles M. Canty, a real estate salesman in Atlanta and the father of four. "I only knew one person." With a chuckle, he added, "You could have all been a bunch of gangsters." He was greeted with laughter.
"This is a bus of fellowship," Otis Thomas Jr., 49. "There's a whole bunch of brothers here I've never seen before, yet we act like we've been around each other for a long time.
"That's what's going to happen at the march," he added. "That makes me very excited."
Many of the men on the bus were middle-aged and middle-class, but that didn't stop them from showing a definite flair for the Afrocentric. A glance over the tops of the bus seats revealed almost as many African-style kufi hats as baseball caps.
Claude Marshall, a 54-year-old man with a close-cropped scalp, began talking about his days in the Vietnam War and his one big regret.
"When the March on Washington happened in 1963, I was 22, and I didn't go," Mr. Marshall lamented. "Now I wish I did. I didn't think it would amount to much.
"But I told myself if there was another, I would go," he went on. "There wasn't anything significant enough for me to bother with until this march, and I'm going."

HEADLINE: THE MARCH ON WASHINGTON: THE OVERVIEW;
Debate on March, and Farrakhan, Persists as Black Men Converge on the Capital

BYLINE: By MICHAEL JANOFSKY 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 15

 BODY:
A stream of black men began arriving here today for the Million Man March conceived as a demonstration of black unity, even as many prominent supporters of the rally continued to wrestle with the debate that has sprung up over the role of the event's chief organizer, Louis Farrakhan.
Many of the 11,000 buses march organizers say are destined for Washington began arriving over the weekend. Today at the rally site, the Mall between the Capitol and the Lincoln Memorial, hundreds of black men strolled in the sunshine, many with their sons, many posing for pictures before the White House or the Capitol with their fists raised in a sign of pride. 
 Planes arriving at the three airports serving Washington brought scores of men who intend to participate, and Amtrak trains pulling into Union Station were jammed with marchers. But a vast majority of the march participants are expected to arrive in the early hours of Monday, creating the strong possibility of chaotic traffic patterns and miles of backups.
Planned by the Nation of Islam for more than a year, the rally has been promoted as a national "holy day of atonement and reconciliation" for black men to pledge responsibility to themselves and their families and to promise to reject behavior that has led many of them to abandon their children, commit crimes and indulge in drugs.
Mr. Farrakhan remained at the center of the debate about the march today, but some supporters continued to argue that his role was being given too much prominence.
"Whites are more likely to see this as a rally of divisiveness," said Ronald Walters, a political science professor at Howard University, who like other supporters acknowledged the disgust with which many people view Mr. Farrakhan for his years of racist and anti-Semitic comments.
But Mr. Walters argued that with retreats on welfare programs and a paucity of good jobs, problems facing blacks have reached such desperate levels that the politics of one individual grows insignificant beside the everyday worries over adequate food, housing and employment.
"For most blacks, this is about pain," Mr. Walters said. "The discussion of Farrakhan is a side issue for us."
Organizers have predicted that more than a million men will attend from around the country, a crowd that would make it the largest political demonstration in the city's history, far surpassing the 250,000 who heard Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. speak at the civil rights demonstration in 1963.
The rally has won the support of many leading black groups, like the Congressional Black Caucus and the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, as well as prominent individuals, like the Rev. Jesse L. Jackson and big-city mayors, like Dennis Archer of Detroit, Marion S. Barry Jr. of Washington and Kurt Schmoke of Baltimore, all of whom said they planned to attend.
But many other respected black voices, including leaders of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, the National Urban League and the National Baptist Convention, have not endorsed the march, citing Mr. Farrakhan's racist oratory and the separatist agenda of the Nation of Islam as wrong ideals. Roy Innis, chairman of the Congress of Racial Equality, said this weekend that march organizers were "exploiting the legitimate aspirations of the rank and file of black America."
Expressing many of the same sentiments, black political figures, like Representative John Lewis, a Democrat from Georgia and a veteran of civil rights battles in the 1960's, and two black House Republicans, J. C. Watts of Oklahoma and Gary A. Franks of Connecticut, said they did not plan to march.
In New York, H. Carl McCall, the State Comptroller, was adamant about refusing to attend. "My reasons for not going are based on my longstanding disagreements with Farrakhan," Mr. McCall said. "I personally cannot participate in anything he is leading."
Representative Charles B. Rangel, a Democrat from Harlem, and Representative Floyd Flake, a Democrat from Queens, did not plan to march either, though Mr. Rangel, despite his district being heavily Jewish, was careful not to criticize Mr. Farrakhan.
But several officials said that they planned to attend, and that they considered the march important. "Anytime you put that many people together in unity, it's excellent," said Adam Clayton Powell 4th, a New York City Councilman who represents East Harlem, parts of the Upper West Side and the South Bronx.
The march has also been denounced by black women's groups and gay and lesbian groups for excluding them from participating. While several black women, including Maya Angelou, the poet, and Rosa Parks, from the early civil rights period, have been invited to speak, all others have been urged to stay home -- from their jobs, their errands and the march -- in a show of solidarity.
But, as many leading black voices have withheld their support, they have nonetheless expressed sympathy for the goals of the march. To shore up support, organizers last week backed off an assertion that support for the march equaled support for Mr. Farrakhan, fearing that larger issues might be obscured by Mr. Farrakhan's reputation among many blacks and whites as a racist and hatemonger.
"There's a racial divide in our country, and this march can help heal it," said the Rev. Benjamin F. Chavis, national director of the march who was dismissed last year as executive director of the N.A.A.C.P. over the use of association money to settle a sex discrimination charge.
"If we can improve our quality of life, we can renew benefits to other people," he said. "If we can stop black-on-black crime, all crime will go down. If we can build strong economic development, if young men can find employment, if they can get a good education, then the whole of society benefits. When you hold down black people, you hold down the whole country."
State Senator David A. Patterson from Harlem said he could not be at the march but said today that he supported the ideals behind the march.
Mr. Jackson, a former Presidential candidate, expressed ardent support for the march today. And while he would not condemn Mr. Farrakhan for his views, Mr. Jackson urged critics to consider "the state of emergency in which the black community finds itself."
"Pain and predicament is driving this march," he said, laying specific blame on conservatives like Speaker Newt Gingrich and Associate Justice Clarence Thomas of the Supreme Court for their role in promoting an agenda against Government support for people in need. "Many cities now have two new buildings, a new jail and a new ballpark. Between those two mountains is a canyon where jobs are sucked out and youth are sucked up."
Mr. Jackson evaded several attempts to be pinned down on his level of support for Mr. Farrakhan.
Despite the calls to separate the leader from the event, the march on Monday could prove a turning point for Mr. Farrakhan, who is known by many Americans mostly for his racist comments.
Mr. Farrakhan, who canceled two television appearances today, citing exhaustion, stirred more criticism last week when Reuters television released an interview in which he called some Jews and other ethnic groups "bloodsuckers" for the way they have operated businesses in black communities.
On Saturday he said those comments were taken out of context.
 On behalf of Mr. Farrakhan and other leaders of black organizations, Mr. Jackson offered to open a dialogue with prominent American Jews, much in the way Mr. Farrakhan offered last week to meet with officials from the Anti-Defamation League of the B'nai B'rith.
Matching the swiftness and response of the League, Rabbi Marvin Hier of the Simon Wiesenthal Center in Los Angeles rejected any conversation between Jewish leaders and Mr. Farrakhan until Mr. Farrakhan "publicly apologizes for his bigotry and anti-Semitism."
Like many critics of the march, Mr. Hier said he could not look past Mr. Farrakhan to consider any positive message that might reach blacks on Monday.
"The only reasons we have not come out and told people not to go is because many have already arrived," he said. "It's ridiculous to think you can separate the message from the messenger," he said. "You can't."

HEADLINE: THE MARCH ON WASHINGTON: THE ORGANIZER;
In the End, Farrakhan Has His Day in the Sun

BYLINE: By DON TERRY 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 16

 BODY:
A sea of black men at his feet, the Capitol at his back and millions watching him on cable television, Louis Farrakhan, the leader of the Nation of Islam, delivered the kind of speech today that he often makes to his religious faithful on a lazy Sunday afternoon back home in Chicago. It was part inspiration, conspiracy theory and numerology, with a good dose of black nationalism and the joys and necessity of bootstrap capitalism. He attacked white supremacy in one breath and then turned around and condemned what he called the failures of black manhood.
"I point out the evils of black people like no other leader alive," the Muslim minister bellowed, a group of stern-faced members of the Nation's paramilitary detail, the Fruit of Islam, at his sides and back, dressed in their dark blue uniforms. 
 The speech, or "lecture," as he called it, began in bright sunshine and ended near dusk more than two hours later, as thousands of those who had come for his Million Man March began leaving to catch buses back to their cities and towns around the United States. According to the National Park Service, they had answered his call 400,000 strong for a day of prayer and protest; organizers put it at more than a million.
The 62-year-old grandfather has been working toward this moment for nearly four decades, since his days as a Calypso singer billed as "The Charmer," but especially in the last 17 years, as he traveled the country talking to small crowds in small churches.
As he methodically went about rebuilding the Nation of Islam in his image, most people beyond black neighborhoods ignored or dismissed him as the head of a sect with a penchant for bow ties and bean pies. And more recently, his public image has been haunted by accusations of anti-Semitism, sexism and homophobia. Just last Friday, in a broadcast interview released by Reuters, he accused some Jewish and Asian business owners of being "bloodsuckers."
But at least parts of his message of pride and anger have struck a chord across class lines, from the brother on the block to the brother in the board room.
"Minister Farrakhan is like E. F. Hutton," said Derick Williams, a 25-year-old resident of a Washington public housing project. "When he speaks, black people listen."
At major events, Mr. Farrakhan often speaks as long as he did today, or longer. At times today he stirred the crowd to cheers, as when he rebuked his critics and delivered his message of black empowerment. "Whether you like it or not, God brought the idea through me, and he didn't bring it through me because my heart was dark with hatred and anti-Semitism," he said, adding, "If my heart were that dark, how is the message so bright, the message so clear, the response so magnificent?"
But other parts of the speech left many baffled. "What is so deep about this number 19?" Mr. Farrakhan asked at one point. "Why are we standing on the Capitol steps today? That number 19, when you have a nine, you have a womb that is pregnant, and when you have a one standing by the nine, it means that there's something secret that has to be unfolded."
At least for this day, Mr. Farrakhan may have earned himself top billing in the drama of black political leadership. But as impressive as the sea of black men on the Mall was, it is unclear what it will mean for Mr. Farrakhan or what it says about the heart and direction of black America.
The turnout makes one thing clear. Mr. Farrakhan, unlike anyone else in some time, has tapped into a deep and wide sense of discontent in black America. Roger Wilkins, a historian at George Mason University, said Mr. Farrakhan had become a powerful voice largely by default.
"Responsible black people," Mr. Wilkins said, "have been trying to get the attention of the Democratic Party and the Republican Party for a long time to tell them that black people were unemployed at double-digit levels for two decades, that black teen-agers are in trouble, black families are falling apart largely because they do not have adequate incomes. White people have not listened.
"Their response," he continued, "was Gingrich's programs to punish the poor. By ignoring moderate black leaders, they sowed the seeds for the emergence of Farrakhan as a more important figure."
Mr. Farrakhan started his own version of the Nation of Islam in 1978, three years after the death of his mentor, Elijah Muhammad, the founder of the Nation 60 years ago.
In 1980, 15,000 people turned out to hear Mr. Farrakhan speak in New York City, and he has been packing them in ever since, said Lawrence H. Mamiya, a professor of religion at Vasser College, who has studied the minister and his Nation for years.
"I think he would like to be perceived as one of the legitimate leaders of black America," Mr. Mamiya said. "I think one reason he called for the march is he feels that the Nation of Islam, in order to grow, will have to begin including people from the member class."
Still, Mr. Mamiya said, Mr. Farrakhan "remains an enigma to those of us who study him."
"How do I characterize his politics?" Mr. Mamiya asked with a laugh. "Disruptive. You can never predict what he is going to say."
Mr. Farrakhan is a Booker T. Washington-style conservative and a Marcus Garvey black nationalist. He lives in the lap of luxury in an integrated neighborhood on Chicago's South Side, just blocks from some of the city's worst black poverty.
He is often portrayed as a militant, but much of what he says sounds ghost-written by a Republican, with its talk of self-help and bootstraps. He is a Muslim but tends to quote more frequently from the Bible of his youth.
In the year before this march, Mr. Farrakhan was devoting time to reconciliation and image polishing. In January, Malcolm X's daughter, Qubilah Bahiyah Shabazz, was charged in Federal court in Minneapolis with trying to hire a hit man to kill Mr. Farrakhan, whom Malcolm X's family had long suspected of playing a role in his death.
But instead of speaking out against Ms. Shabazz, Mr. Farrakhan condemned the Government, saying Ms. Shabazz had been set up. That led to a public embrace by Malcolm X's widow, a show of unity and healing that went a long way toward enhancing Mr. Farrakhan's reputation beyond the Nation.
That is a prospect that worries Prof. Adolph Reed, a professor of political science at Northwestern University.
Professor Reed said the march was a symbol of a growing sense of desperation in many blacks, including middle-class blacks who fear attacks on affirmative action.
"People are feeling pinched and threatened, and a lot of political leaders don't seem to have any answers," Professor Reed said. "People like Farrakhan feed on that sort of desperation. The substance of his message and agenda meshes well with right-wing Republicans."
But Professor Reed's concerns seemed far removed from the black men who had listened to Mr. Farrakhan for more than two hours. After the minister had finished, they hugged and shook hands with friends and strangers. Then they headed home past dozens of vendors selling T-shirts, videos, books and candy bars. Most of the items had a picture of a smiling Louis Farrakhan.

Fearing Japanese Bank Frailty, U.S. Agrees to Give Future Help

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 16

 BODY:
Worried by the financial health of Japanese banks, the Federal Reserve has arranged to provide Japanese financial authorities with billions of dollars almost instantly in exchange for Treasury bonds and bills in case of a sudden cash crisis, Government officials said tonight.
While the Federal Reserve has responded to shortages of credit in the past by paying cash for huge sums in Treasury securities, the new agreement appears to be the first time in memory that the Fed has sought in advance to guard against a possible crisis. 
 The plan seems to be aimed particularly at providing money quickly for use by Japanese regulators if one or more Japanese banks run into trouble and need a bailout during trading hours in the United States -- nighttime in Japan. The Japanese financial markets are closed then and the regulatory agencies are closed, as well.
The move appears to reflect deep concern among American financial officials about the potential for trouble among Japanese financial institutions, many of which are far larger than the biggest banks in the United States. The arrangement with Japan would give American regulators a presumably risk-free way of dampening the shock waves from any possible Japanese liquidity crisis.
In such a crisis, a Japanese bank with more assets than liabilities might nonetheless find itself suddenly unable to raise enough ready cash to meet a debt due immediately. In the worst case, that could potentially set off a chain reaction of defaults affecting banks around the world.
Representative Jim Leach, Republican of Iowa and chairman of the House Banking Committee, said tonight that he had recently been briefed by the Federal Reserve on the arrangement, which he praised as a prudent precaution. He said that it was virtually risk free, unlike the American-led bailout of Mexico, because the Fed would be accepting Treasury bonds and Treasury bills in exchange for the cash.
The deal would also allow Japanese financial authorities or big banks to raise immense amounts of cash without the potential disruption of financial markets and soaring interest rates that might accompany any Japanese move to sell huge quantities of Treasury securities. The Japanese central bank keeps large sums invested in Treasury securities at the Federal Reserve, and the new arrangement would allow a few regulators in Tokyo to move fast in the middle of the night there to raise money for a bank that had financial difficulties during the day in the United States.
The Japanese newspaper Asahi Shimbun reported last Thursday that the Government might borrow money from the Federal Reserve using Treasury securities as collateral. Japan's central bank denied the report today as wrong, but did not elaborate.
The Japanese banking industry has suffered a spate of bad news lately, forcing banks to begin paying slightly higher rates of interest as some foreign lenders perceive new risks. The bad news ranges from the failure of five financial institutions in the last year -- two last month -- to disappointing ratings by Moody's Investors Service to the disclosure of a $1.1 billion loss at Daiwa Bank from unauthorized trading in New York.
Over the last few months, officials at the Fed and the Treasury Department have tried to work behind the scenes with their Japanese counterparts to stabilize the situation, while minimizing their worries in public for fear of driving investment capital away from Tokyo.
Even so, foreign banks, concerned about Japan's banking crisis, are trimming their loans to Japanese financial institutions. That has raised the risk of a potential liquidity squeeze.
"There appear to be many banks that are facing great difficulty in raising foreign funds," Izumi Tagawa, a spokesman for the Chuo Trust and Banking Company, said today. Mr. Tagawa quickly said that his own bank, which is turning a profit mostly from stock sales, was not experiencing a problem raising money overseas.
Some Japanese financial institutions have recently been forced to turn for help to the country's biggest banks. Or, they have had to take their yen deposits and convert them into American dollars to meet financial obligations overseas, Japanese and foreign bankers and analysts said in interviews in Japan.
Mr. Leach, one of the Federal Reserve's closest allies on Capitol Hill, hinted at the arrangement during his opening remarks at a hearing he held today on the Japanese banking industry, which is struggling to cope with at least $400 billion in bad loans.
"While our Government does not expect an unmanageable situation to arise," he said, "it is prepared to cooperate fully with Japanese authorities to facilitate in any emergency liquidity for Japanese banks operating in the United States. It is also working closely with Japanese authorities to render appropriate advice and support with the understanding that the Japanese Government has the resources internally and externally to handle any problems on its own."
In a telephone interview tonight from his home, Mr. Leach said that the plan was aimed at preventing a sudden shortage of ready cash in the Japanese financial system, known in banking parlance as a lack of liquidity. A strong supporter of the American-led bailout of Mexico last winter, Mr. Leach drew the distinction between that effort and the new arrangement.
The Federal Reserve plan, he added, "is intended as a symbol of cooperation and the capacities of the Federal Reserve, which are rather enormous."
Fed officials declined to comment on all this today. Treasury Department officials would also not comment.
Many Japanese executives, discussing the same set of problems before Mr. Leach's hearing began, acknowledged in Tokyo that their industry suffered from liquidity problems abroad.
But they deny that the problems hamper their own institutions, an unsurprising stance, since a bank that admits to difficulties may be admired for its candor, but the admirers will not lend to it.
A study released here today by the Congressional Research Service said that two of Japan's major banks had to pay 19 basis points more for their short-term borrowings of dollars in London last month than comparable European and American banks. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. The Congressional service did not identify the two banks.
Japanese banks hold $400 billion in United States Treasury bonds, and account for 9.4 percent of all lending in the United States, the Congressional Research Service said, warning that a severe banking crisis in Japan could divert some of that money away from the United States.
But financial-industry experts testifying at today's House Banking Committee hearing played down that concern. "I don't see that we should be afraid of significant disinvestment in America" because Japanese banks still need to lend money to valued Japanese corporate customers doing business here, said Alicia Ogawa, a securities analyst at Salomon Brothers Asia in Tokyo.
It was not clear tonight whether Japanese authorities would have to sell Treasury bonds and bills to the Federal Reserve with no hope of recovering them. The alternative would be for the Fed to lend cash to the Japanese central bank while holding the Treasury securities as collateral.
Mr. Leach said that no legislation would be needed to carry out the Federal Reserve's arrangement, and that he did not expect any serious criticism of the plan in Congress.
"It's an understanding with Japanese banks and authorities -- it is not anything beyond the power of the Fed," he said. "It is patently reasonable; I don't think there would be any objection."

HEADLINE: Coast Guard Plans to Leave Governors I.

BYLINE: By DON VAN NATTA Jr. 

 BODY:
The United States Coast Guard will close its base on Governors Island in New York Harbor by the end of 1998, ending its storied and secluded 212-year history as an American military installation and potentially becoming, by the end of the century, one of New York City's most valuable pieces of real estate.
In closing the installation, the Coast Guard's New York-based operations will cut 500 of its 1,800 workers. The rest will be scattered to bases of operation in Staten Island and Bayonne, N.J., but most -- nearly 1,000 -- will be relocated to bases in Tidewater, Va., and Charleston, S.C. 
The decision to vacate the 175-acre island -- the largest Coast Guard base in the country -- was made yesterday in Washington by Admiral Robert E. Kramek. The move will save an estimated $30 million a year; the Coast Guard needs to cut $400 million annually from its budget of $3.8 billion. The closing will be announced formally at a press conference scheduled for today.
Coast Guard officials said yesterday that the cuts would not diminish their search-and-rescue duties or patrol and enforcement efforts in and around New York Harbor.
"For us, the goal is to provide the best service to the public at the lowest possible cost, and we think this does that," Lieut. Pat Philbin, a spokesman for the Coast Guard, said last night. "We targeted infrastructure, which was the primary factor in our decision, and not necessarily the economic impact to New York City."
The dismantling of the base, scheduled to begin next spring, will leave vacant the historic island, which lies in the shadow of lower Manhattan's skyline, instantly making it one of New York City's most desirable chunks of real estate.
The island, accessible only by ferry and helicopter with Coast Guard permission, is an unspoiled town with 4,000 residents, a hotel, beauty salon, bowling alley, movie theater, nine-hole golf course, Burger King restaurant and, best of all, glorious vistas of lower Manhattan and the Statue of Liberty.
In 1627, a Dutch official bought Governors Island from the Manahatas Indians for two ax heads, a string of beads and some nails. Earlier this year, the Congressional Budget Office estimated the island is worth $500 million, but several Congressional aides said yesterday that that price would be "a bargain."
If legislation now before Congress passes, New York City and New York State would have the right of first refusal to buy the land from the Federal Government. The legislation, passed by the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, would bypass the laborious procedures that require making the land available for other public uses, such as city dumps, before the land is offered for sale.
In anticipation of the Coast Guard decision, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani appointed a task force last month to study the future of the island. The committee, whose head is Deputy Mayor Fran Reiter, is made up of members of the Economic Development Corporation, the City Planning Commission and the Landmarks Preservation Commission.
"We don't know what the ultimate outcome will be, but we are going to allow the task force to explore the many possible uses for the island," said Lenny Alcivar, an assistant press secretary for Mayor Giuliani.
However, if the city and state decide to pass on negotiating a price with the Federal Government, the land is likely to be auctioned to private developers, who have expressed much delight about the prospect of building on the island. The developer Donald M. Trump has described the island as "great visually, great artistically and great for security."
A major factor in the closing of Governors Island is its high cost to run, Coast Guard officials said. Another factor is the high cost of living borne by its 4,000 workers and family members.
"It is expensive for our families to live in that area," said Lieutenant Philbin, the Coast Guard spokesman based in Washington.
The dismantling of the installation will occur gradually over the next three years. "We are not going to all leave at once and just turn the lights out," said Lieut. John Shallman, a Coast Guard spokesman in New York.
The Coast Guard will begin relocating its New York operations to sites at Rosebank and Fort Wadsworth on Staten Island, with nearly 325 jobs relocating there, many of them held by the petty officers who manage the flow of the hundreds of boats and ships that use New York Harbor every day. Another 150 personnel will move, along with several Coast Guard cutters, to Bayonne.
Representative Susan Molinari, a Republican, lobbied to have the Coast Guard relocate to Staten Island. It was also her idea to amend legislation to give New York City and New York State the first chance to buy Governors Island.
"This is great news for Staten Island," Ms. Molinari said last night. "The Coast Guard plan saves tens of millions of dollars and pumps some of it right into the North Shore."
By the end of the century, the Coast Guard will leave for good, turning the tiny island over to the Government's General Services Administration, which will then try to sell it.
In the meantime, the Coast Guard officials who live and work on the island are not looking forward to their last day there, Coast Guard officials said yesterday. Most of them requested assignment on Governors Island, and some have lived there for years.
In a way, the base closing is an eviction for them.
"How can you not love New York City?" said Lieutenant Shallman, who has lived on Governors Island for almost four years. "We live in a small-town atmosphere in the middle of the largest, busiest metropolitan area in the world. Sure, we'll miss it."

HEADLINE: THE MARCH ON WASHINGTON;
Excerpts From Talk By Clinton In Texas

BYLINE: By The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 16

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from President Clinton's address today at the University of Texas, as recorded by the Federal Information Systems Corporation, a transcription service:
In recent weeks, every one of us has been made aware of a simple truth: white Americans and black Americans often see the same world in drastically different ways, ways that go beyond and beneath the Simpson trial and its aftermath, which brought these perceptions so starkly into the open. The rift we see before us that is tearing at the heart of America exists in spite of the remarkable progress black Americans have made in the last generation. . . . 
 The rift between blacks and whites exists still in a very special way in America, in spite of the fact that we have become much more racially and ethnically diverse and that Hispanic-Americans, themselves no strangers to discrimination, are now almost 10 percent of our national population.
The reasons for this divide are many. Some are rooted in the awful history and stubborn persistence of racism. Some are rooted in the different ways we experience the threats of modern life to personal security, family values and strong communities. Some are rooted in the fact that we still haven't learned to talk frankly, to listen carefully and to work together across racial lines.
Almost 30 years ago, Dr. Martin Luther King took his last march with sanitation workers in Memphis. They marched for dignity, equality and economic justice. Many carried placards that read simply, "I am a man." The throngs of men marching in Washington today -- almost all of them -- are doing so for the same stated reason.
But there is a profound difference between this march today and those of 30 years ago. Thirty years ago, the marchers were demanding that dignity and opportunity they were due because in the face of terrible discrimination, they had worked hard, raised their children, paid their taxes, obeyed the laws and fought our wars.
Well, today's march is also about pride and dignity and respect -- but after a generation of deepening social problems that disproportionately impact black Americans. It is also about black men taking renewed responsibility for themselves, their families and their communities. It's about saying no to crime and drugs and violence. It's about standing up for atonement and reconciliation. It's about insisting that others do the same and offering to help them. It's about the frank admission that unless black men shoulder their load, no one else can help them or their brothers, their sisters and their children escape the hard, bleak lives that too many of them still face.
Of course, some of those in the march do have a history that is far from its message of atonement and reconciliation. One million men are right to be standing up for personal responsibility, but one million men do not make right one man's message of malice and division. No good house was ever built on a bad foundation. Nothing good ever came of hate. . . .
There is still unacceptable economic disparity between blacks and whites. It is so fashionable to talk today about African-Americans as if they had been some sort of protected class. Many whites think blacks are getting more than their fair share in terms of jobs and promotions. That is not true. That is not true.
The truth is that African-Americans still make on average about 60 percent of what white people do and more than half of African-American children live in poverty. . . .
On the other hand, blacks must understand and acknowledge the roots of white fear in America. There is a legitimate fear of the violence that is too prevalent in our urban areas. . . .
We must all take responsibility for ourselves, our conduct and our attitudes. America, we must clean our house of racism. To our white citizens I say, I know most of you every day do your very best by your own lights to live a life free of discrimination.
Nevertheless, too many destructive ideas are gaining currency in our midst. The taped voice of one policeman should fill you with outrage.
So I say we must clean the house of white America of racism. Americans who are in the white majority should be proud to stand up and be heard denouncing the sort of racist rhetoric we heard on that tape, so loudly and clearly denouncing it that our black fellow citizens can hear us. White racism may be black people's burden, but it's white people's problem. We must clean our house.
To our black citizens, I honor the presence of hundreds of thousands of men in Washington today committed to atonement and to personal responsibility, and the commitment of millions of other men and women who are African-American to this cause. I call upon you to build on this effort to share equally in the promise of America. But to do that, your house, too, must be cleaned of racism.
There are too many today -- there are too many today, white and black, on the left and the right, on the street corners and the radio waves, who seek to sow division for their own purposes. To them I say: "No more. We must be one."

HEADLINE: Wall Journal;
Swords to Plowshares: A Coda to the Cold War

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE 

DATELINE: WALL, S.D.

 BODY:
For 30 years, the unmarked chain link fence on Dale Keyser's dry pasture land enclosed a 36-ton missile that could fly over the North Pole and carbonize a Russian city in less than 30 minutes.
Today, in an era of disarmament, Mr. Keyser calculates that the same security fence designed to foil Soviet saboteurs should also be able stop South Dakota deer. 
 "It's right by my hayfields -- it'll be easy to use as a hay corral," Mr. Keyser, a 76-year-old farmer, said of his recently deactivated Minuteman II missile site. "Other ranchers may find it handy to use theirs as a cattle corral."
In a coda to the cold war, demolition crews working under Air Force contracts methodically moved across this landscape of grasslands and gullies last summer, imploding empty underground missile silos.
Because of an arms reduction treaty signed by President George Bush in 1992, all 150 Minuteman missiles in South Dakota have been removed from the silos, which are about 80 feet deep. The missiles have been dismantled for recycling or saved in warehouses; the 1.5 megaton warheads have been sent to Texas for disassembly.
"If you don't have the gun, the bullet is not much use," said Tim Pavek, a civilian missile engineer who directs the silo destruction program from Ellsworth Air Force Base in Rapid City, 30 miles west of this town of 834 people in southwest-central South Dakota.
With the Air Force paying $185,000 to destroy each silo, Gene S. Williams, president of the Missile Area Landowners Association, believes the Federal Government is "pouring more good money down the hole."
"It seems like an awful lot of dollars to destroy something that, given the way the world works, they may be building 5 to 10 years from now somewhere else," Mr. Williams said.
Maj. Joseph Mecadon of the Air Force, the public relations officer at Ellsworth, mourns the lack of public interest in the deactivation program. "We're taking a step back from the nuclear abyss -- nobody knows, nobody cares," said Major Mecadon, recalling that disarmament demonstrations were regular events at South Dakota silos in the late 1980's.
Although few ranchers will admit to missing their missiles, there is a bit of ICBM nostalgia sweeping this desolate corner of the High Plains. And for a rural town like Wall, the end of the arms race means washboard roads and higher electricity rates.
Scattered over a thinly populated area the size of New Jersey and Connecticut combined, the Minutemen silos and launching centers required a 1,000-mile access network of smoothly graded gravel roads, maintained with Air Force money. With the departure of the missile system, which was the largest customer for several rural electric cooperatives, electricity rates here are expected to rise.
Under the present schedule, ranchers next year will be able to buy back at fair market value the one-acre to one-and-a-half-acre missile sites they sold to the Federal Government during the Kennedy Administration. The Air Force also plans to abandon a 1,500-mile network of buried cables that linked the silos and launching control centers.
Some of the bittersweet feelings about disarmament flowed last year at a farewell Fourth of July dinner dance for the 44th Missile Wing. With a section of the Berlin Wall standing as a backdrop, speakers hailed the wing's "11,000 days of vigilance." Each of the 1,000 guests received a souvenir set of gold-plated missile launching keys.
South Dakota's three-man Congressional delegation attended the banquet, testimony to the fact that Ellsworth Air Force Base remains the state's largest employer. Hoping to soften the economic blow caused by the departure of the 1,700-member missile wing, politicians began promoting a patriotic tour package: Mount Rushmore in the morning and missile sites in the afternoon. Rushmore is only a two-hour drive from the missile sites.
For today's generation, shaped by nuclear movies ranging from "Dr. Strangelove" to "The Day After," a cold war museum would offer a tour of a preserved missile silo site and an underground launching center. To that end, the National Park Service is preparing for Congressional review a proposal for a Minuteman Missile National Historic Site.
With 99 of the 150 silos already demolished, the Air Force has spared one silo and one launching center to be part of the proposed museum. Both sites are conveniently situated close to Interstate 90, the major highway linking the Badlands National Park and Mount Rushmore.
To some, cold war history may seem a little too fresh. At the launching center, code-named Delta One, a Garfield cartoon still hangs over the mess hall's food window and a Mr. Coffee machine still stands on a Formica table in the lounge. But 31 feet below this 1960's suburban style house where missile crews were billeted, real history begins.
At the base of the elevator, a painted rocket emblazoned with "USAF" blasts through a shredded Soviet flag. The eight-ton steel and concrete "blast door" to the launching control center is decorated with more missileer artwork: a Minuteman II rocket painted on an imaginary pizza box, with the slogan, "Worldwide delivery in 30 minutes or less -- or your next one is free."
Inside, a visitor can sit in the launching commander's chair, inspecting the key-and-code system designed to prevent the accidental triggering of a Minuteman missile armed with a bomb 100 times the destructive power of the one dropped on Hiroshima in 1945.
Installed in the early 1960's, this intimidating wall of electronic gadgetry has a total computing power of 4k -- the equivalent of a modern pocket calculator.

HEADLINE: TJX Will Buy Marshalls Chain From Melville

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN 

 BODY:
The Melville Corporation said yesterday that it had agreed to sell its faltering Marshalls division to the TJX Companies for $550 million in cash and stock.
The deal, analysts said, would provide some needed consolidation in the fiercely competitive discount clothing business. 
 Under the terms of the transaction, TJX will put up $375 million of the purchase price in cash. The remaining $175 million will be in the form of TJX junior convertible preferred stock.
To help pay for the acquisition, TJX, which is based in Framingham, Mass., said it would cut its annual dividend in half, to 28 cents a share, saving $20 million a year. The company said it would also stop a share-buyback program.
Investor reaction to the sale, which had been rumored for the last two weeks, was muted. On the New York Stock Exchange, the shares of Melville rose 50 cents, to $35.50. TJX's stock dipped 12.5 cents, to $14.50.
The deal is expected to bolster TJX's position in the discount-clothing market, giving it 495 Marshalls stores in 40 states and Puerto Rico. TJX operates the T. J. Maxx chain of 571 stores and had $3.8 billion in sales last year. Marshalls had sales of $2.8 billion.
The president of TJX, Bernard Cammarata, is said to have told analysts that he expected that TJX would close 190 of the combined company's stores.
"I think it was a smart, strategic decision" for TJX, said Jeffrey Edelman, a retailing analyst with C. J. Lawrence Deutsche Bank. "They are taking out a competitor, and it allows them to generate economies of scale. Now they have to execute and prove to us they can manage the transition."
Much of the success of the purchase will depend on the degree to which the combination will ease competitive pressures in an industry in which distinctions between various types of businesses have become blurred, analysts said.
"The price differential between off-price stores and department stores has been narrowing," said Donald J. Trott, who follows the industry for Dean Witter Reynolds. By buying Marshalls, TJX believes it "can widen that price differential out and rationalize some of the excess capacity in the industry," he said.
The sale is the first big move by Melville, which is based in Rye, N. Y., since its announcement last December that it was beginning a strategic review of all its businesses in an effort to generate greater value for shareholders.
Although Marshalls represented about 25 percent of Melville's $11.3 billion in sales last year, profits at the division have been declining over the last few years. Melville's biggest operation is the CVS drugstore chain.
During a telephone conference call with Wall Street analysts, Mr. Cammarata of TJX disclosed that pretax operating earnings at Marshalls fell by 20 percent in 1994 from 1993 and were down again so far this year, Mr. Trott of Dean Witter said.
In an interview, Stanley P. Goldstein, Melville's chairman and chief executive, said, "There is no question the off-price business has been struggling for the last couple of years."
As part of the strategic review, "we had to decide whether we wanted to be a buyer or a seller" of discount stores, he said.
"As things transpired," he said, "we decided to sell our business to an entity like T. J. Maxx. And we will still retain an interest in the equity of the combined companies."
In connection with the sale, Melville said it would take an after-tax charge of $195 million in its fourth quarter. The company said the sale would reduce fourth-quarter operating earnings as a result of lost sales in the holiday season.

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS;
Privatizing in Hungary: A Door Reopens

BYLINE: By NATHANIEL C. NASH 

DATELINE: BUDAPEST

 BODY:
It has been hard lately to take privatization in Eastern Europe seriously. Just look at the case of Hungary over the last year.
When foreign investors seemed to have locked up a deal to buy a dairy, the purchase was scotched in favor of a lower offer by a local farming cooperative. "Very important political reasons" were cited. 
 Last December, when a Dallas hotel company was on the verge of buying the Hungar Hotels chain, Prime Minister Gyula Horn stopped the deal and ordered an investigation that led to the dismissal of the privatization commissioner.
But now, there seems to have been a reversal. After more than two years of bumbling along, Hungary has put up for sale the crown jewels -- its oil company, its electricity- and gas-distribution industry, its major banks and a second stock installment in the state telephone company, Matav. (A consortium of Deutsche Telekom and Ameritech already owns a 30 percent stake.)
Global players in oil and gas, electricity and telecommunications are knocking on Hungary's door, apparently convinced that the country is at last getting serious about privatizing its largest companies.
The Government has hired investment bankers, including CS First Boston, Kleinwort Benson, Merrill Lynch and Deutsche Bank, to market the companies and hopes to raise nearly $2 billion in coming months.
"The interest in privatizations here is very strong," said Sunil Sabharwal, head of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development in Budapest. "That is quite obvious by the number of major companies that are looking at MOL," referring to Hungary's state oil and gas company, which plans to sell stock beginning in mid-November.
Indeed, bankers predict that over the next year, more money could be poured into privatizations in Eastern Europe by foreign investors than in all the previous years combined.
In July, the Czech Republic raised $1.45 billion for a stake in its state telephone company bought by a consortium led by Koninklijke PTT of the Netherlands that included Swiss Telecom and AT&T.
The Government also recently completed the sale of a 49 percent stake in two of its largest refineries, Kralupy and Litvinov, to a consortium of Royal Dutch/Shell; Conoco of the United States, a unit of Du Pont, and AGIP of Italy for $180 million, plus a promise to invest $520 million more over five years.
And it is also getting ready to privatize its steel, mining, electricity and chemical industries later next year.
In Poland, where very few of the major state-owned enterprises have been sold to private investors, the Government is taking the first serious steps, Western bankers say. It recently set up a system under which 14 investment funds, with heavy representation of foreign capital and managers, will control about 400 state-owned companies.
In Hungary, polls show that the public is opposed to the selloffs, but the Government seems to have little choice. It is burdened with almost $22 billion in debt and is running big budget deficits. Selling state assets is one way to get bloated numbers of employees off public payrolls and repay some of the debt.
The sale of the 30 percent stake in MOL will represent the first time an oil company in Eastern Europe has gone on the block and one of the few times any government has offered to sell its national oil company.
MOL has several advantages. One is its sheer size. It dominates the economy, accounting for 90 percent of the nation's oil and gas production, refining and reserves. It is a fully integrated energy company, engaged in everything from exploration to importing natural gas from Russia, refining crude oil and operating a chain of gas stations. And its Duna oil refinery south of Budapest is considered "among the most sophisticated units in the Central and East European region," according to a recent report by Nomura Securities in London.
The same report estimated that the oil and gas reserves of MOL were worth $1.8 billion, greater than its current market value of $1 billion. (The Government currently owns 88 percent of MOL, while municipalities own 7 percent and individual investors have 5 percent.)
The global public offering that Merrill Lynch and Kleinwort Benson are planning in November is expected to bring in at least $300 million for the 30 percent stake.
But hopes for a smooth sale were nearly dashed on Sept. 12, when the Government dismissed two top executives at the company and replaced them with Lazlo Pal, a hard-line Socialist who is a leader of the far-left faction of the Socialist Party, the renamed Communists. A Russian-trained engineer with no experience in the oil business, he was dismissed as trade minister in June for opposing the privatization program.
In particular, he has opposed passing management control of strategic industries to foreign companies.
"I just don't know what the Government was thinking," said a prominent investment banker, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. "How are you going to parade such a man before the international investment community in a credible way?"
Officials, though, were quick to defend Mr. Pal.
"We felt MOL needs a more dynamic personality at the head to get the privatization going," said Tamas Suchman, the Minister for Privatization.
And Mr. Pal issued a statement saying he fully embraced the Government's privatization plan.
In the end, the appointment was seen as an attempt by the Prime Minister to give Mr. Pal a visible appointment and blunt any political interference he might create.
But it did not make investors feel any more comfortable about attempts to persuade them that now was the time to buy into Hungary, especially since the Government has apparently scrapped plans to let a large energy company buy a controlling interest in MOL.
"Several American oil companies were interested in buying MOL," Peter Fath, executive director of the American Chamber of Commerce, told a local newspaper here. "Their top executives made repeated visits to Hungary, and Prime Minister Horn promised at the time that MOL would be available for strategic investors. He changed his mind. And now Mr. Pal is at the head of MOL."

HEADLINE: Pakistan Arrests 40 Officers; Islamic Militant Tie Suspected

BYLINE: By JOHN F. BURNS 

DATELINE: NEW DELHI, Oct. 16

 BODY:
In a move that has underscored growing political tensions in Pakistan, Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto's Government has disclosed that it secretly arrested 40 army officers last month, one of them a two-star general, on suspicion that they were linked to Islamic fundamentalist groups.
Since confirming the arrests in a meeting with Pakistani newspaper editors on Saturday, Ms. Bhutto has imposed an official silence. But newspapers in Pakistan, citing Government officials, have said the officers were rounded up in Islamabad, the Pakistan capital, on Sept. 26, and taken to a military prison in the city of Quetta for questioning. 
 Some newspaper reports in Pakistan have said the officers are suspected of plotting to overthrow the Bhutto Government. But Western diplomats in Islamabad said a more likely explanation was that the Government, eager to enhance its ties with the United States and promote possible American arms deliveries, was responding to pressures from Washington for a crackdown on Islamic terrorist groups that have used Pakistan as a base.
For years, there have been allegations that officers of the Inter-Services Intelligence agency have been involved in arming and training Islamic fundamentalist groups that have mounted terrorist attacks outside Pakistan. Some Pakistan newspaper reports have said the most senior officer seized in the September roundup, Maj. Gen. Zahirul Islam Abbasi, who was the army's director general of infantry at the time of his arrest, previously served in the intelligence agency.
Diplomats who suggested that Ms. Bhutto's purpose in ordering the arrest had been to strengthen ties with the United States noted that in February she approved a joint operation in Islamabad by United States and Pakistani intelligence agents that captured Ramzi Ahmed Yousef, a prime suspect in the World Trade Center bombing in New York in February 1993 that killed six people and wounded more than 1,000. Mr. Yousef is now awaiting trial in New York.
The arrest of the officers is the latest in a series of developments that have underlined growing political instability in Pakistan. In recent months, the Bhutto Government has been arresting opposition leaders and placing new constraints on Pakistan's newspapers, and otherwise acting in a fashion that has caused critics to suggest that Pakistan's fragile democracy could be at risk.
In a new blow to the Government on Sunday, Nasir Hussain, the husband of Ms. Bhutto's sister, Sanam, was arrested at Karachi airport on suspicion of involvement in the slaying that day of a dissident member of the governing Pakistan People's Party. Ms. Bhutto's father, Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, who was Prime Minister in the 1970's, was hanged in 1979 after being convicted by a military court of involvement in the killing of a leading People's Party dissident.
According to published reports in Pakistan, those arrested last month included, besides General Abbasi, a colonel and at least 38 other officers. The arrests had been rumored in Islamabad for some time, but Pakistani newspapers ran no reports about them until Ms. Bhutto's remarks on the weekend.
Even then, the Prime Minister was elusive. "Some individuals are under investigation, but it is premature to say anything," she said. "When the investigations are completed, details will be known, and the nation will be taken into confidence."
One newspaper, The Daily News, said today that the officers had been arrested on suspicion of "violating service discipline" and "hatching a conspiracy to overthrow the Government by capturing the command of the Pakistan Army." The army has seized power on several occasions, ruling directly for 25 of the 48 years of Pakistan's existence.
But officials of the Bhutto Government who discussed the issue guardedly on the telephone played down the reports of a coup plot, saying an attempt to topple the Government would have required more than 40 officers, and more than one general.
But diplomats said Ms. Bhutto was more likely to have been prompted by events in Washington, where a joint House-Senate conference will shortly take up a measure passed by the Senate last month that would allow the first military sales in five years to Pakistan. An amendment to the foreign aid appropriations bill that was introduced by Senator Hank Brown, a Colorado Republican, would allow the United States in the coming year to deliver $368 million in military equipment that Pakistan bought in 1990, before the passage of the so-called Pressler amendment that banned military and economic aid to Pakistan until it abandons its covert nuclear weapons program.
Under the Brown amendment, Pakistan would get three Orion anti- submarine aircraft, air-to-air and surface-to-surface missiles, radar equipment and parts for Cobra helicopters, as well as parts and equipment for F-16 fighter-bombers that are part of Pakistan's front-line arsenal. The amendment would also make possible millions of dollars in direct economic aid to Pakistan.
But the measure is expected to face stiff opposition in the House-Senate discussions, and could be vetoed by President Clinton for other reasons even if it survives in the final version of the appropriations bill approved by the two houses.

U.S. Bond Prices Retain Gains From Friday Rally

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities rebounded from early weakness yesterday to finish mostly higher, although the long bond was unchanged, with its yield remaining at a 20-month low of 6.30 percent and its price at 107 21/32.
Eric Hamilton, senior fixed-income analyst at Technical Data in Boston, said dollar weakness influenced the Treasury market to open on a down note after Friday's big rally. And there was some light profit taking after Treasury securities rallied strongly on Friday. 
 Among the hurdles facing the market in the days ahead are the resolution of the Federal budget battle and the size of the supply of Treasury securities that will be coming to market over the next few weeks. Federal authority to spend and borrow money expires next month unless the budget issue is resolved.
"Traders are wondering how any sort of debt-ceiling pressure will affect the Treasury auction schedule," Mr. Hamilton said. "Most seem to believe that there is a chance the Treasury may have to cut the size of this week's two- and five-year note announcement because of debt ceiling restrictions.
"Others aren't quite as concerned about the risk of hitting the ceiling this week, but the November refunding announcement could be affected if the resolution is not passed soon."
The lack of supply in the near term, he said, would lift prices of shorter maturitites.
But the market consensus is that there is very little likelihood that the Treasury will default on any of its debt. "What they could do instead is postpone a couple of the weekly bill auctions," Mr. Hamilton said, "something the Treasury has done in the past when the debt ceiling was reached." Postponing a couple of the auctions would mean that investors would be somewhat limited in choosing securities. Tomorrow, the Treasury will announce the size of its next auction of two- and five-year notes.
At the auction of new three-month and six-month bills yesterday, interest rates were sightly higher, underscoring a point made by Margo Evashevski, a Treasury analyst at MMS International in San Francisco. "Bills have seen less demand than the rest of the curve lately, given how far they are below the Federal funds," she said.
The rate for a three-month issue was up one basis point, or hundredth of a percentage point, to 5.32 percent, while the six-month issue was up 2 basis points, to 5.34 percent.
The December bond futures contract pulled back from the contract high set on Friday with investors declining to increase commitment without more proof that the economy was slowing and inflation was no danger.
Robin Mesch, chief fixed-income analyst at Thomson Research in Boston, said it was a quiet day in the futures market, with much of the time spent absorbing Friday's large gains. She said it appeared that 116 20/32 was the major support level for the week.
The December contract went as low as 116 28/32 on the day, with the high at 117 12/32. "Below 116 20/32, another support level would be a full point below at 115 20/32," Ms. Mesch said. "This is still a buy-on-the-dip market, and I would only change my mind about where the buy will turn, if within the next three days we're no higher than 117 15/32. Then I would consider the probability that the market would pull back to the lower stands of support." Yesterday she said the bond contract settled at 117 2/32.
The contract held above the support seen at around 117, but off the high of 117 19/32 set last week.
The Commerce Department reported yesterday that August business inventories rose four-tenths of a percent, higher than the expected one-tenth of a percent and the rise of three-tenths of a percent in July. The cash market and futures trading in debt remained weaker after the data, which showed the highest monthly gain in a year.
The next interest rate reduction and market rally may hinge on whether a budget accord can be fashioned by Congress and the President. Most traders agree that the market has priced in most of the good economic news for now.
Following are the results of yesterday's Treasury auction of new three- and six-month bills:

The Air of a Holiday in an Ailing City

BYLINE: By Evelyn Nieves 

DATELINE: CAMDEN, N.J.

 BODY:
CARLAH MYERS and her two daughters were fairly skipping along Linden Street, taking in the morning. They looked like a postcard for Disney World, all three wearing smiles and Mickey Mouse shirts. And with the sun beating down a mid-October chill, if you squinted past the boarded row houses, their downtown neighborhood looked almost pretty.
It surely seemed a little different, for a Monday. Calmer, quieter. In the narrow business district, pedestrians stepped lightly and traffic moved at Sunday speed. It felt like a holiday. 
 "It's a great day to be alive," said Ms. Myers, who is 25. "Even in Camden." She didn't even mind that her daughters, 8 and 7, were out of school and that she had to drag them to the Laundromat. "All for a good cause," she said. "We firmly believe it."
Happily for city officials, she was not alone. When Camden decided to close the schools yesterday in observance of the Million Man March in Washington, it marked a first: the first time a school district shut down for an out-of-town rally where not everyone was invited. (The School Board said that so many employees had asked for the day off, it would have cost too much for substitutes. Parents could have rebelled. They didn't.)
And considering all the controversies surrounding the march for black men -- that it excluded black women, and everyone else; that it was organized by the Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan, famous for his divisive speech; that it asked blacks to boycott white businesses for the day -- you might have expected more criticism on the street.
But the march was endorsed in this predominantly black city at the highest levels. The Mayor, Arnold Webster, took the day off to attend. So did the schools superintendent, Roy Dawson. Women, while not allowed to go, were among those who cheerfully waved to the 1,000 or so men who boarded buses before dawn for their day of atonement and reconciliation at the National Mall.
"I know about 20 guys who went, including my brother," Ms. Myers said. "I'm proud of them."
SOME men who did not go said they would have liked to. Clay Price, an electrical contractor who opted to work ("I've got a family to feed"), said that if a similar rally were held here, he would try to make it. "We really need to address our situation," he said, shaking his head.
If there was ever a place that personified the thousand social ills the Million Man March organizers hope to address, Camden is it. It was almost too easy here to obey the march organizers who told blacks not to work today (the jobless rate hovers at about 22 percent), not to shop (more than half the residents live in poverty) and not to spend money (two-thirds receive some type of public assistance).
There are no movie theaters or major shopping centers, and the aquarium is out of reach for many residents. It costs $9.95 for adults and children over 11 to get in, $6.95 for younger children. (Ms. Myers took her daughters once. "It cost us about $50 for the day," she said. That, she added, is what she makes for two full days as a baby sitter.)
Neighborhood watch groups do their best, but violence persists. Last week, when two men were shot to death after an argument at a Chinese fast-food restaurant, the number of people murdered this year climbed to 47, four short of the record set in 1992. With 87,500 residents, Camden is moving closer to the top of the list of cities with the highest murder rates in the nation. The lead editorial in yesterday's Camden Courier-Post ("Camden police force could use outside help") suggested the Mayor call in the National Guard.
With all the good work and intentions of nonprofit community associations, much of Camden is falling down. On some blocks, all of the houses are boarded, some falling apart. Other blocks are barely breathing. (In some cases, drug dealers sitting on stoops and men sharing bottles of hard liquor on the corner are the only signs of life.) The vacant lots in many neighborhoods are hardly vacant. They are garbage repositories, strewn with broken furniture, refrigerators and burned debris.
If only the march organizers had offered an alternative to staying home and staying put. They might have asked: stay home -- and pick up one piece of trash on the street. Bring one can from the back of the cupboard to a soup kitchen. Take the heroin addict at the corner to a clinic. Clean up one little "vacant" lot.
THAT idea made Ms. Myers and her neighbor, Gladys Ramos, crack up laughing. "You would've gotten a lot more men going to the march and a lot more women complaining," Ms. Myers said. Her daughters were riffling through a battered algebra textbook that someone had left at the Laundromat. Was their father at the march? "I wouldn't know," their mother said.
"I do wish they would've invited everyone," said Ms. Ramos, who is raising her 3-year-old daughter alone. "They could have said, this is a day for black men, but everyone is invited to encourage and support us, for a change."

HEADLINE: Mitsubishi May End Its Chrysler Tie

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Oct. 16

 BODY:
The Mitsubishi Motors Corporation is considering dissolving its United States car production agreement with the Chrysler Corporation by 1999, an official of the Japanese car maker said today.
Mitsubishi produces about 100,000 cars a year for Chrysler at its Mitsubishi Motor Manufacturing of America plant in Normal, Ill. 
 A Mitsubishi spokeswoman said Hirokazu Nakamura, Mitsubishi's chairman, had told Japanese reporters recently that if the American auto maker wanted to go independent after the current vehicle-production arrangement expires in 1999, Mitsubishi's plant in Illinois would build only Mitsubishi models. It now also produces Eagle Talon, Chrysler Sebring and Dodge Avenger models for Chrysler.
The Japanese economic newspaper Nihon Keizai reported over the weekend that Chrysler saw little necessity for receiving supplies from Mitsubishi because of a "recovery in competition."
The spokeswoman said Mitsubishi would increase the number of dealerships by 60 in the United States by 1998 from the current 500 to strengthen its sales there.
But she refused to provide further details, saying that final decision on whether to renew the arrangement has yet to be made. She said negotiations between the two companies had yet to be held.
Chrysler buys Mitsubishi sports cars built in Japan and sells them as Dodge Stealth models. It also buys Mitsubishi small cars built in Japan and sells them as Eagle Summit models.

HEADLINE: America Arms Turkey's Repression

 BODY:
Turkey lags behind only Israel and Egypt in receipt of American military aid. Washington has approved $7.8 billion in military sales to Turkey in the last decade -- and has provided grants or loans to cover most of it. This year, unless dramatic events take place in the current House-Senate conference, Turkey will get $320 million in American credits to finish production -- in Turkey -- of F-16 fighter planes.
America has traditionally used such aid to maintain its friendship with a strategically crucial ally. But the aid is now being used to prolong a war that both destabilizes Turkey and betrays American values. The State Department has acknowledged that Turkey is using the F-16's and other American weapons to strafe Turkish villages in its war against a Kurdish guerrilla group, killing thousands of civilians and leaving millions homeless. Washington should end the sale of weapons used in the war, and condition further military aid and sales on Turkish respect for human rights. 
 One-fifth of Turks are Kurdish, a minority so repressed that its members are even forbidden to speak Kurdish in many public settings. In 1984 the Marxist Kurdish Workers' Party, or P.K.K., began a brutal civil war, killing many civilian officials and Kurdish opponents. The Turkish Government responded with an even more brutal campaign to bomb and burn Kurdish villages. It has prosecuted even peaceful Kurdish politicians, writers and human rights workers whose only crime was describing the human rights violations. An American reporter for Reuters, Aliza Marcus, may be sentenced to three years in jail for her reporting from Kurdish areas. The P.K.K. is weak, but the Government has made little progress toward winning the war. Polls show that Turks overwhelmingly favor a political settlement.
Turkey's human rights record has caused several European countries to cut off military relationships -- although Germany just resumed aid -- and has so far denied Turkey coveted membership in the European Union. But the White House has allowed Turkish troops to pursue the P.K.K. into Kurdish areas of Iraq that America protects against Saddam Hussein. The Turkish incursions have killed many civilian Kurds.
Since the Turks' war against the P.K.K. escalated in 1992, American military aid to Turkey has escalated as well. Washington now provides 85 percent of Turkey's arms imports and 90 percent of its military aid. Despite the efforts of Senator Patrick Leahy, Democrat of Vermont, and Representative John Edward Porter, an Illinois Republican, to curtail aid, Congress has not yet managed to block or place conditions on substantial amounts of Turkish military aid.
Turkey has escaped a cutback because of its strategic importance. America depends on military bases in Turkey, and wants Turkey to spread its moderate brand of Islam to Central Asia and its pro-Western views to the Balkans and the Mideast.
The Turkish Government and the Clinton Administration argue that any cuts in arms transfers would weaken and radicalize Turkey. But the war itself poses a greater threat to Turkey's stability and prosperity. Its Islamic party, a relatively moderate one, gained support after a ban on Kurdish parties left it as the only non-mainstream alternative.
Any further aid should carry human rights conditions that would promote a political solution to a war that has undermined Turkish democracy, boosted the power of the military, drained the economy and divided Turkey from its European allies. Placing such conditions on assistance would also reduce America's complicity in Turkey's repressive internal war.

HEADLINE: Dow Declines 9.40 Points, Despite Technology Issues' Gains

BYLINE: By LEONARD SLOANE 

 BODY:
Stock prices weakened yesterday, beginning with a round of computer-guided sell orders and ending with anticipation about expected earnings reports from Intel and Microsoft.
Intel, after the stock market closed, said its third-quarter profits rose 38 percent, to $1.05 a share; its shares closed up 3/8, at 63 1/8. Microsoft, which is scheduled to report its results today, advanced 1/2, to 86 3/4. 
 "The market did not really have a big move one way or the other," said Don Hays, director of investment strategy at Wheat First Butcher Singer in Richmond. "It digested some of Friday's gains and backed off a little."
The Dow Jones industrial average fell 9.40 points, or 0.20 percent, to 4,784.38. Among the broader averages, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index dropped 1.47 points, or 0.25 percent, to 583.03 and the Nasdaq composite index eased 0.25 point, or 0.02 percent, to 1,018.13.
Declining issues topped advances on the New York Stock Exchange by 1,210 to 1,061. Turnover on the Big Board was moderate, dropping to 300.8 million shares from 374.7 million shares on Friday.
"The tug of war is starting, and it will get even worse after the earnings season," Mr. Hays added. "Some people thought that the economy was too hot in January, and now there are growing concerns about a recession."
Food stocks declined after CPC International reported an earnings gain that analysts found disappointing. CPC fell 1/2, to 69; Kellogg dropped 1 1/2, to 72 5/8; and Procter & Gamble slumped 7/8, to 79 3/8.
Retail issues lost ground, spurred by concerns over speculation that Kmart may file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. K-Mart, which plunged to a five-year low Friday, continued to fall yesterday, closing down 7/8 at 10 1/2. Wal-Mart, which said that the retailing climate remained difficult in this price-cutting period, declined 5/8 to 22 1/2.
Financial companies were also lower. Chase, which reported a 7.8 percent drop in its third-quarter earnings, lost 1, to 64 5/8. Nationsbank, which posted a 23 percent gain, fell 3/8, to 71 1/4. Meanwhile, American Express slipped 1/4, to 44 1/2.
Many technology stocks, however, moved upward. In addition to Intel and Microsoft, Dell Computer advanced 1 1/4, to 84 1/4; the Andrew Corporation increased 1 3/4, to 46; and Zebra Technologies rose 2 7/8, to 56 3/4.
Medical-equipment stocks gained on a favorable earnings outlook, with Nellcor Puritan climbing 3 3/8, to 53 7/8, and Lunar surging 3 1/4, to 34 1/8. Texas Utilities jumped 1 3/8, to 36, on traders' expectations of improved financial performance.
A number of special situations suffered significant setbacks yesterday. The Equity Corporation International, a funeral-home operator, said third-quarter net income would fall below Wall Street estimates; its shares dropped 2 3/4, to 20 1/2. Cincinnati Microwave, which announced that it expected to report a third-quarter loss, declined 2 1/2 to 8. And International Lottery, which said that MCI Communications was questioning an order for phone-card dispensing machines, slipped 2, to 10 3/4. MCI ended off 1/8, at 24 1/2.

He Filled a Vacuum

BYLINE: By RUSSELL BAKER 

 BODY:
So it was left to Louis Farrakhan to act. It is hard to say why without speaking realistically of the state of American politics, which has less and less to do with anything of consequence.
Surely somebody of stature, Democrat or Republican, ought to have felt obliged to act long ago. It is hardly a secret that one of the country's most dangerous problems is the increasingly desperate situation of its young black male citizens. 
 The portrait of a nation in trouble is etched in the statistics on black unemployment rates, black school dropouts, rising imprisonment of young blacks and killings of black youngsters by black youngsters.
When a large portion of a nation's youth is being thrown away, or hustled into prisons, or lowered into graves, it takes a remarkable capacity for indifference to say that, well, it's a pity, but it's not our problem, it's a problem for the black community, black churches, black neighborhood leaders.
It is hard to see how a multiracial nation can avoid damage if its leaders refuse to deal with its gravest problems on ground that they are distinctively problems of race.
This mistake was made by President Eisenhower 40 years ago and swiftly regretted, for Eisenhower was a serious man, serious about government's duties. He tried to avoid the multiracial reality of America in the Arkansas school desegregation crisis by arguing that race passions resided in the human heart, which could not be changed by government action.
When Arkansas's white Governor Faubus proposed to let the white human heart express itself by defying a court desegregation order, however, Eisenhower used the Army to preserve government by law.
Everybody now knows about the problem of the young black male, and nobody with power has done anything about it. To be sure, President Clinton has gone into the occasional black church and made the correct sounds, but where is the high-powered, bipartisan, interracial Presidential commission empowered to recommend executive and legislative action?
Have the leaders of the black community put pressure on White House and Congress to wake up? If so, the pressure has been as that of a feather pillow on the pyramid of Cheops.
Who are the leaders of this black community, anyhow? Are there any, or are they just fictional creations of the media? Maybe the "black community" is fictional, too. Why shouldn't it be? After all, there is no such thing as a "white community," no group who can sensibly be called "white leaders."
Maybe it is tired old racist thinking to keep talking about a "black community" complete with "black leaders." Maybe it makes more sense nowadays to drop all that separatist language and say, "There's nobody here but us Americans."
The Clinton Administration is not the first to do nothing about the desperate situation of the young black American. Doing nothing about it has been the unswerving policy of Presidents back as far as Richard Nixon. Not incidentally, it was Mr. Nixon's so-called "Southern strategy" that rebuilt the Republican Party on white hostility to the Democratic record on civil rights.
Nor are the dynamic new Gingrich conservatives engaged with the problem. The Contract With America may ask us to assume that its blessings will lead, one of these days, to more secure childhoods, better schooling, better jobs and a full dinner pail for young black men, but in the meantime it is explicit about the need to cut welfare.
If a single Republican Presidential candidate has spoken of the matter that produced the Million Man March, it has been a pianissimo performance.
Let's not forget, either, the fierce and forbidding tetchiness of many black people, which discourages whites from discussing the problem. It is understandable that a politician might ignore the subject entirely when he fears that getting involved may earn him the epithet of "racist."
Some kind of action was overdue. There was a vacuum to be filled. Politics has declined into a game for overgrown boys and their high-tech toys. You win by finessing reality. So finally it was left for Louis Farrakhan to act. It made a lot of people so mad they could spit. That often happens when good people have done nothing.

HEADLINE: COMPANY REPORTS;
Profits Surge At Ameritech For Quarter

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

DATELINE: CHICAGO, Oct. 16

 BODY:
The Ameritech Corporation said today that its third-quarter profits from operations rose nearly 11 percent as a result of an increase in the number of its telephone lines and the traffic they carried.
The Chicago-based regional Bell telephone company said its net income more than doubled, mainly because of one-time items. The results met analysts' expectations. 
 Ameritech reported profit from operations of $464.3 million, or 84 cents a share, compared with $419.1 million, or 76 cents, a year earlier.
Including one-time items in both quarters, net income totaled $512.5 million in the latest quarter, compared with $250.9 million in the 1994 quarter. Third-quarter revenue rose 6.7 percent to $3.38 billion, from $3.17 billion.
Ameritech said it posted a record 4.4 percent increase in the number of phone lines to more than 1 million. Oren Shaffer, chief financial officer, said the record growth was due to increased marketing efforts by Ameritech. The amount of traffic on Ameritech's network rose 8.7 percent, the company said.
The rise in earnings was powered by "strong local-service revenue gains driven by record growth in access lines and successful new product introductions," Connie Luecke, a Duff & Phelps analyst, said in a research report.
Ms. Luecke cautioned that Ameritech's earnings growth would slow next quarter as the "trend of declining depreciation expense reverses," Luecke wrote.
Telephone-line growth was better than expected, according to Richard Klugman, an analyst at Paine Webber Research.
And the number of cellular customers rose 47 percent from a year ago to 1.67 million. The increase was buoyed by a low "churn rate" of 12 percent annually, Ameritech said. By comparison, the industry average for "churn" -- the rate at which customers leave one company to buy cellular services from another -- is about 31 percent annually, according to Economic Management Consultants International, a market research firm in Washington.
One-time items in the latest quarter's net income included a gain of $6.9 million, or 1 cent a share, for job cuts and a gain of $41.3 million, or 7 cents, from the sale of certain cellular operations. The 1994 quarter's results included a charge of $168.2 million, or 30 cents a share, for job cuts.

b-Included an after-tax gain of $41.3 million, or 7 cents a share, resulting from the swap of minority interests in certain cellular partnerships in Indianapolis, Cleveland and Rockford in exchange for cash and a minority interest in the Ameritech Detroit/Flint cellular partnership.
The latest quarter also included an after-tax credit of $6.9 million, or 1 cent a share, related to net settlement gains associated with lump-sum pension payments from the nonmanagement pension plan to former employees, related to the work force restructuring program. Excluding the gains, net income was $464.3 million, or 84 cents a share.
c-Included an after-tax charge of $168.2 million, or 30 cents a share, related to work force restructuring. Excluding the charge, net income was $419.1 million, or 76 cents a share.

HEADLINE: What Economists See

 BODY:
To the Editor:
The Nobel laureate in economics Robert E. Lucas Jr. told the press (Business Day, Oct. 11) that the United States economy "is in excellent shape." I see stagnant real wages, large-scale unemployment and underemployment, increasing inequality of wealth and income shares, rising poverty, persistent racial disadvantage and much more that burdens most people. 
 When I studied economics, the test that mattered was the well-being of people and their communities. The 1986 pastoral letter of the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops, "Economic Justice for All," summed it up well: what the economy does to people and for people.
Are we looking at the same economy? Or have economists so narrowed their vision they cannot connect the intellectual world they live in with the real world they purport to explain?

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
French and Italian Politics Send Mark Up and the Dollar Down

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
The dollar slipped against most other leading currencies yesterday as new political troubles in France and Italy bolstered the German mark.
The political uncertainty raised doubt that the two Governments would make the tough budget choices needed to meet requirements for European monetary union laid out in the Maastricht treaty, and it sent some investors seeking security in the mark, analysts said. 
 The slide of the franc and lira against the mark weighed on the dollar because some of these transactions were executed through dollars. Traders will sell, for example, francs and lire for dollars and then sell those dollars for marks.
Nevertheless, the dollar remained well within recent ranges yesterday. Since Sept. 22, the dollar has traded between 1.4058 and 1.4440 marks and 97.50 and 101.81 yen. Trade reports from the United States and Japan, to be released today and tomorrow, might give the dollar clearer direction, traders said.
In New York late yesterday, the dollar slipped to 100.63 Japanese yen from 100.97 yen on Friday. It fell to 1.4235 marks from 1.4265 marks and to 1.1543 Swiss francs from 1.1547 francs. But the British pound slipped to $1.5740 from $1.5755.
The French franc slumped after the nation's central bank surprised investors by cutting its 24-hour loan rate. The franc suffered another blow when the newspaper Le Monde reported that Finance Minister Jean Arthuis was embroiled in an investigation of possibly illegal political financing.
The decision to cut its 24-hour loan rate by a quarter-point, to 7 percent, came just a week after the French raised the rate by 1.10 percentage points to shore up the franc.
"The fact that the Bank of France rather prematurely cut rates this morning quite surprised investors," said Callum Henderson, senior currency analyst at MMS International.
Lower French rates reduce the return that investors receive on franc-denominated deposits and often make the French currency less attractive. The franc was last at 3.4868 francs to the mark, weaker than 3.4772 late Friday in New York.
The mark gained versus the Italian lira after former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi threatened to oppose Italy's 1996 budget. On Saturday, Mr. Berlusconi, who still heads a conservative coalition, was ordered to stand trial on corruption charges, a case that could hurt his chances to regain high office.

HEADLINE: Crackdown on Mob at Fish Market Brings Chaos

BYLINE: By SELWYN RAAB 

 BODY:
The first day of New York City's latest crackdown on Mafia domination of the Fulton Fish Market dissolved into chaos early yesterday as hundreds of workers staged a wildcat strike, virtually halting seafood distribution and prompting Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani to threaten a temporary shutdown of the market.
Asserting that some workers and merchants were trying to sabotage his plan to clean up the market, Mr. Giuliani warned that he might reorganize it by hiring new workers and by licensing different merchants to do business there if disorder continued. Under a law that went into effect on Sept. 1, the city has the power to determine who can work and run businesses in the market, the nation's largest wholesale seafood distribution center. 
 Police officers were out in force early this morning in an effort to avoid a repeat of the disruptions.
The predawn walkout yesterday came hours after the city installed a new company, the Laro Maintenance Corporation, to unload fish and seafood there and evicted six companies that Federal investigators said were suspected of being linked to mobsters.
Almost no seafood or fish was sold at the Fulton market yesterday. Buyers for city restaurants scrambled to line up other sources of seafood and fish, and most said they were able to assure a steady supply.
The workers who walked off their jobs were employees of the approximately 60 wholesale seafood vendors that operate at the market. They said their job action was a show of solidarity with the 40 employees who lost their jobs when the six unloading companies were evicted.
The eviction and the walkout produced hours of confusion and tension for workers, the police and the market's customers. At one point, the market was plunged into almost complete darkness when master electrical switches were tampered with and employees roamed around the market, disrupting operations.
The tension continued into this morning, as the police escorted wholesalers to and from the market. When the wholesalers arrived to deliver their fish, they stopped at a checkpoint for police officers to enter the trucks; the officers then stood by as each truck was unloaded, and later escorted it out of the market to another checkpoint several blocks away.
For some out-of-town wholesalers, what would normally have been a two- or three-hour delivery turned into a journey that found them in the city for almost 24 hours.
Some distributors said small retail stores in the New York area might soon be without seafood or fish if the market was disrupted another day or two. They said they would have to seek supplies from markets in Philadelphia, in Boston and on the Pacific Coast, raising the likelihood that customers would pay higher prices.
Wholesale dealers in the market said their individual losses in potential sales yesterday ranged from $20,000 to $100,000. Representatives for the 60 vendors estimated that far less than half of the 500,000 pounds of fish that flows into the market each workday was delivered, but because of the chaos, virtually no buyers could enter the market.
"If there is a repeat performance tonight of last night," a stern-faced Mr. Giuliani said yesterday at City Hall, "we will close the market, and we will reconstitute the work force and we will make certain that the work force is not influenced by organized crime, not influenced by corruption and not influenced by the desire to commit illegal acts or to extort people who do business there, or the city of New York.
"It would be better for the city actually not to have the Fulton Fish Market if it's going to be operated the way it has been for the last 40, 50, 60 years."
More than 100 million pounds of fish and seafood are sold each year at the market, generating about $1 billion a year in business.
But for decades, officials say, much of that money has wound up in the pockets of organized crime, setting off a seemingly endless series of often-futile crackdowns by law enforcement agents.
City officials, Federal prosecutors and a temporary Federal administrator have charged that the six evicted companies, known as unloaders, were a mob-influenced cartel dictating fees paid by the dealers and the manner in which trucks were unloaded. By doing so, the officials contend that the companies had an economic stranglehold over the movement of perishable supplies into the market and were not permitting dealers to switch companies.
The owners of the six unloading companies have denied any ties to organized crime and none have been indicted or charged with a crime.
Under the new system, officials say, the Laro company has cut unloading costs by about 20 percent and guaranteed to unload cargoes on a first come, first served basis.
But from the moment the Laro workers took over late Sunday night, confusion and congestion reigned, and most wholesale dealers said the old system was more efficient than the new arrangement.
The drivers who brought seafood in refrigerated 18-wheel trailers from ports as far away as New Brunswick in Canada and the Gulf of Mexico complained that the Laro crews were incompetent, mishandling the forklifts and pallets used to remove cargo and transport it 50 to 60 feet to merchants' stalls. Laro, based in Bay Shore, L.I., has no experience in seafood distribution. The company's business has largely involved cleaning office buildings, airports and the Statue of Liberty.
The drivers said that if the disruptions continued, seafood suppliers and transportation companies would shy away from the market because of possible financial loses.
"They have no idea what they're doing," said Bryan Sullivan, a driver for JDS Refrigerated Transporation of Chelsea, Mass., who waited seven hours to be unloaded. "They're doing everything wrong."
Frank Minio, a dealer and the owner of Smitty's Fillet House, said he was stuck with 20,000 pounds of cod, sole, red snapper and tuna. "I'm not sure what happened, but no customers showed up," he added.
Owners of three of the six ousted companies, standing near their former work sites early this morning, criticized Laro employees, and denied any Mafia influence in their businesses or assertions that they were trying to disrupt the market.
"We have no intention of causing trouble," said Jerry Prisinzano, owner of one of the companies. "We just want to get our businesses back."
The revised unloading system is the most critical step taken by the Giuliani administration to revamp the market under new regulatory powers granted by the City Council. In March, one of the two main market buildings was gutted by arson and since then the administration has substantially raised rents for dealers and also evicted six merchants who failed background checks.
Robert Bertuglia Jr., the president of Laro, who worked through the night at the market supervising crews, said many wholesalers and drivers were sympathetic to the ousted companies and their 40 employees and had tried to slow the unloading process. Mr. Bertuglia said between 58 and 65 trucks were unloaded.
An additional 20 trucks could not be unloaded, he said, because employees of the wholesale dealers, who are called journeymen, intimidated Laro employees. All 50 of his employees were forced to leave at 5:30 A.M. under police escort.
"We did a hell of a job," Mr. Bertuglia said, "considering all the intimidation and obstacles we encountered."
The sympathy that Mr. Bertuglia saw from the drivers did not seem evident in the long line of trucks waiting to enter the market. Frustrated drivers clanged incessantly on ear-shattering tractor-trailer horns to protest unloading delays that in some cases reached up to 15 hours.
Grim wholesalers said that the new and inexperienced unloading crews brought in by the city were unable to deliver most of their consignments before 3 A.M., when buyers show up.
For several hours, the market was plunged into almost total darkness after someone tampered with master switches for the huge fluorescent lights that illuminate the wholesalers' stalls along South Street on the banks of the East River near the Brooklyn Bridge.
When morning came and the market's day ended, wooden crates and cardboard boxes filled with salmon and lobsters from Bucks Harbor, Me., oysters from Chesapeake Bay and Whiting from Mastic Beach, L.I., were piled in front of the dealers' stalls. Merchants said the only way they could preserve the supplies was by caking it in ice.

HEADLINE: Nafta Costs Mexico More Job Losses Than U.S.;
Long-Shaky Peso

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Your Oct. 12 news analysis on the Mexican $52 billion rescue operation engineered by the Clinton Administration demands some redress. 
 Democratic Congressional critics -- notably Richard Gephardt, David Bonior, Marcy Kaptur -- and others like the Economic Policy Institute's Jeff Faux and Thea Lee made a clear connection between the North American Free Trade Agreement and the peso collapse in December 1994.
Mexico was running a current account deficit of $23 billion to $25 billion in 1994, which reflected an overvalued peso that exaggerated American exports to Mexico and minimized Mexican exports to the United States, creating a substantial trade surplus in favor of the United States.
Proponents of Nafta extrapolated this surplus as a permanent feature of the American-Mexico economic relationship and urged that the excess of exports over imports from Mexico meant the trade agreement would create 170,000 net new jobs in the remainder of the decade.
The critics argued that this surplus was unsustainable and that it was being financed largely with "hot" money -- funds seeking a higher return than they could obtain in more conventional financial markets. But these funds were volatile, subject to interest rate increases in the United States and flight at the merest hint of political difficulties, of which there was no lack in Mexico.
Even impeccably establishment economists such as Rudi Dornbusch of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and John Williamson of the Institute for International Economics testified to this effect in May 1993, six months before Nafta was approved by Congress.
Why didn't Mexican and United States authorities address the already evident overvaluation of the peso? Because they were determined to obtain Congressional passage of Nafta and to assure victory by the governing party candidate in the Mexican presidential elections in August 1994 so as to consolidate the economic strategy that led to the trade agreement.
Devaluation of the peso would have exposed the artificiality of the United States trade surplus with Mexico and the bankruptcy of the net-new-jobs argument derived from that surplus, the basis on which the North American Free Trade Agreement was sold to the American public.

HEADLINE: Business Assails Democrats on Pension Bills

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 17

 BODY:
Big business fired back today at Democrats who argue that Republican legislation would endanger Americans' retirement security.
The Chamber of Commerce, the National Association of Manufacturers and other industry groups released two studies by consulting firms supporting legislation that would permit companies to withdraw funds from employee pension plans. 
 House and Senate committees have approved different versions. The more expansive House proposal could lead to withdrawals of as much as $40 billion, generating extra revenue for the Government because the money would then become taxable.
The Clinton Administration has denounced the provision as a pension raid that would drain money invested on behalf of workers, running the risk that some pension funds could fail if interest rates and the stock market dropped sharply.
The Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, the Federal agency backing pension funds, said 22,000 plans covering 2 million retirees and 11 million current employees could potentially be affected.
But one study released by the business groups, by Towers Perrin, said the provision would result in "only a tiny increased risk" that a plan would become underfinanced.
Another study, by Watson Wyatt Worldwide, said the pension agency's worst-case assumption for evaluating the safety of pension plans -- a 1 percent drop in interest rates combined with a 10 percent drop in securities prices -- "has never happened over the past 70 years."

HEADLINE: Vote Leaves Iraqi as Winner and West at a Loss

BYLINE: By YOUSSEF M. IBRAHIM 

DATELINE: BAGHDAD, Iraq, Oct. 17

 BODY:
On Monday, as Saddam Hussein was celebrating his 99.96 percent approval rating in Sunday's referendum on his presidency, 25-year-old Malek was loitering outside a hospital here, looking for a customer for one of his kidneys.
The gaunt young man, who has been out of work for two years and would not give his full name, seemed oblivious to the fanfare surrounding the official celebration, in which the Government-controlled media was lavishing every imaginable praise on President Hussein. 
 Malek's major preoccupation was finding an elusive Libyan who he thought would pay $550 for a healthy kidney, a small fortune in Iraq's depressed economy.
"At first my parents were opposed, but I have to support them and two brothers and a sister," Malek said as he sat at a teahouse in a Muslim Shiite neighborhood of Baghdad. "Now they see the necessity."
Five years of economic sanctions, imposed by the United Nations after Iraq invaded Kuwait, have deepened the poverty and despair of Iraqis to the extent that Baghdad has become a center for wealthy Arabs in search of organs for transplant.
But the sanctions seem to have had little impact on Mr. Hussein or the power structure over which he presides unperturbed and, according to many Iraqis and foreign diplomats, secure.
Although the Iraqi leader's downfall has become the undeclared condition for lifting the economic siege -- at least as far as the United States and its Arab gulf allies, Kuwait and Saudi Arabia, are concerned -- Mr. Hussein's domination of Iraq appears to be growing, periodically reaffirmed by the ability of his Baath Arab Socialist Party to mobilize a downtrodden population almost at will.
"If this referendum proves anything, it is that the party is firmly in control of Iraq and Saddam runs it with an iron fist," a Western ambassador here said. "If they can organize a referendum like this in less than three weeks, mobilize party cadres in every village, hamlet, town and city, produce precise lists for eight million voters and march all of them to the polls to say 'yes' unanimously, it means they are not about to fall.".
Mr. Hussein, who made no public appearances during the referendum, was sworn in today as President for another seven years in a televised ceremony. His Deputy Prime Minister, Tariq Aziz, pledged political reforms, including parliamentary elections next year, although previously promised reforms have not materialized.
In Karbala, a stronghold of the Shiite minority about 55 miles south of Baghdad, the streets were nearly deserted on Sunday, but the polling stations were full of people waving their "yes" ballots for all to see.
The population in Karbala rose up in revolt against Mr. Hussein's rule in March 1991 after the Persian Gulf war. Ironically, the brutal suppression of that rebellion was overseen by Lieut. Gen. Hussein Kamel al-Mahjid, a son-in-law of President Hussein who defected to Jordan in August.
But when the referendum results were announced in Karbala on Monday evening, 270,867 voters there, where many families lost relatives in the uprising, had said "yes" to the President's continued rule.
Not one had voted "no," the Government said.
Judging by scores of impromptu interviews here in the last week, however, it is not clear that Saddam Hussein would have been rejected had the voting been free.
Many Iraqis simply do not understand why their country is prohibited under the United Nations sanctions from selling its oil and blame their predicament on foreign attitudes that extend beyond a personal vendetta against President Hussein to a longstanding prejudice against Arabs in general.
Even those who dare voice dissident views in the privacy of their homes express contradictory sentiments as to who is responsible for Iraq's miseries, their anger alternating between President Hussein and the West.
"About a year ago, it became clear that even Saddam understands he has to comply with the United Nations conditions" for easing the sanctions, including full disclosure of information on weapons of mass destruction, a dissident poet said. "The regime speaks openly of its intention to comply on radio and television. But the more it does, the more it appears the American aim is not just contrition but the destruction of Iraq as a unified nation, and the humiliation of Iraqis as a people.
"It is time for the world to re-examine the notion of using sanctions to obtain political aims," the poet continued. "Castro is still there after 35 years of sanctions. In Iraq, it has been five years. If there were any chance that people would rise again, they would have risen by now."
Instead of rebelling, Iraqis appear preoccupied with the struggle to survive from one day to the next.
On Baghdad's largest shopping avenue, Saadoun, Dawood Hillal did not want to hear about politics or who is to blame for Iraq's tribulations.
"Please don't ask silly questions," the pharmacist said, standing amidst rows of empty shelves. "We have 11,000 children dying of malnutrition here every year. Nothing can justify this genocide.
"For every 50 people that come in, I can help one, maybe," he said. "Before the war, we had 5,500 varieties of subsidized medicines in Iraq. Now we have 100 categories, and most of what I get of those hardly lasts for five days."
For its part, the Government has been actively reinforcing its defenses.
In private conversations, Government officials say they believe that the sanctions may continue for some time, at least until the presidential elections in the United States, more than a year from now.
In a two-hour conversation, Information Minister Hamid Yusif al-Hammadi, a close confident of President Hussein, gave the impression of a leadership that has deftly shifted the blame for Iraq's plight to the West while blunting the impact of the economic sanctions.
"There are some good aspects to the situation," Mr. Hammadi said. Imports of food have plummeted from 75 to 30 percent, he said, and productivity, particularly in agriculture, has increased as consumption has been forced down.
He said that the Government has allowed one of the most severely affected segments of Iraq's 20 million population, the nearly 1 million Government employees on fixed incomes, to seek outside jobs to supplement its pay.
With the money that remains from the more prosperous times before the 1990 invasion of Kuwait, Iraq is launching several labor-intensive projects including the construction of three major dams, south of Sammarra and north and south of Mosul.
And Government-controlled rationing of food insures that most Iraqis get half their needed calorie intake.
"The upshot is: There are hardships, but this is not Rwanda," Mr. Hammadi said. "If the United States thinks it can use starvation as a weapon against Iraq, it will be frustrated."
The country's chief vulnerability appears to be the acute shortage of medicine.
A waiter at a restaurant frequented by several foreign reporters here slipped a note to one as he left. It said: "Dear sir, sorry to trouble you. I know you are very kind and therefore, when you leave the country, could you give me whatever medication you have. I'm poor and I have a big family. The winter is coming. Any antibiotics would be a great help."
However, none of these miseries appear to touch those who run the country.
Shortly before the voting started on Sunday, the nationalist Russian politician, Vladimir Zhirinovsky, the highest-ranking foreign observer invited to monitor the referendum, bounced happily into the lobby of Baghdad's Rashid Hotel following what he described as a sumptuous banquet with President Hussein.
"The President is in a very good mood; he was philosophical and relaxed," declared Mr. Zhirinovsky, who was making his fourth visit to Iraq.
Mr. Zhirinovsky was received with great fanfare on his arrival on Sunday and taken to a Baghdad palace where he feasted with President Hussein, Mr. Aziz, the Deputy Prime Minister, and other top officials on what he described as "a beautiful fish -- a presidential fish -- in a palace that the Americans couldn't and didn't bomb during the last war."

HEADLINE: Yale Degree, Minus the Fabled Dorms

BYLINE: By JONATHAN RABINOVITZ 

DATELINE: NEW HAVEN, Oct. 17

 BODY:
With their ornate neo-Gothic towers, gated courtyards and oak-paneled dining halls, the dormitories here at Yale have come to epitomize a certain ideal of what college life should be like: "A stage set made in Hollywood for a musical about Oxford," the British magazine Punch wrote of the campus.
For more than a half-century, the residential colleges, as Yale refers to its undergraduate living quarters, have been viewed as much more than dormitories. These intimate communities of 400 to 500 students, who dine, study and party together, is touted by university officials as the centerpiece of the Yale experience. 
 So why, in 1995, are hundreds of the best and brightest fleeing these hallowed dorms, which now number 12, to live on their own in New Haven, a troubled city that prospective freshmen often cite as a reason to go to Harvard?
"If I were to put in three words why people move off campus, it would be 'food, food, food,' " said Tim Randall, a junior from Old Saybrook, Conn. To make dorm life bearable, he equipped the patio outside his room with a Weber grill and hot tub that he brought from home.
"This is terrible," moaned another student, as he showed a visitor his dorm room. "I'm 20 years old and I'm sharing a room with a bunk bed."
Richard C. Levin, Yale's president, said, "I've talked with some students who are going off campus for cable television," adding that this was a minority.
There is no single explanation for the exodus, but this year, a record number -- about 890 of the 5,100 undergraduates -- have moved off campus, up almost 70 percent from the roughly 530 living outside the colleges five years ago. Students and university officials point out that rising Yale board prices -- now accounting for $6,630 of the $27,630 term bill -- have coincided with a sharp drop in New Haven rents. While some dorms have become run-down, the neighborhoods surrounding Yale have been redeveloped, with university support, and appear to have become safer.
At the same time, students seem to be less tolerant of doubling up in a small bedroom (only seniors are guaranteed singles) and living without the latest amenities.
True, the campus living conditions are not dramatically different from years past, and Yale undergraduates have survived them, even enjoyed them, for decades. Alumni even talk fondly of the food.
But this is a new generation of students. Right now, many say, it is simply not cool to live in the dorms.
Although Yale is unusual among most American colleges in housing the vast majority of its students on campus, it is not alone in experiencing this exodus. The percentage of undergraduates living off campus nationally has increased to 85 percent from 80 percent five years ago, said Barbara Jacoby, director of the National Clearinghouse for Commuter Programs, based at the University of Maryland.
While part of that increase can be attributed to the growth of community colleges and urban colleges, Dr. Jacoby said that the shift is relevant to almost all colleges, going beyond economic reasons. "It's also a life-style issue," she said. "Students want out of in loco parentis."
At a few state college campuses in the Midwest, dormitories have been boarded up, and housing administrators across the country have taken steps to upgrade their dormitories. At the University of Nebraska at Lincoln, the school has added hundreds of single rooms and special meal plans, built new parking spaces adjacent to dorm rooms and rewired the buildings for computer hookups and cable television.
"It's not the same as when I started college in 1963," said Doug Zatechka, housing director at the University of Nebraska. "We see more and more students who had their own room, their own TV, their own stereo, their own telephone and their own telephone number. It's more difficult for them to share a dresser and space."
"I'm not blaming them," he added. "They're coming in here with 18 years of experience, and we have to adjust."
Yale, too, is taking the issue seriously.
To address the complaints of dilapidated dormitories, including tales of mice, cockroaches, heatless winter nights and leaking ceilings, Yale is renovating all its dormitories and is scheduled to complete the job in the next five years. In response to complaints about the food, the university has offered a more flexible meal plan that gives students $100 in credit per semester at off-campus restaurants.
Mr. Levin has also prohibited any sophomores from moving off campus, starting next year. (Freshmen are already forbidden to do so). And he appeared a little perplexed as to why such a step would be necessary.
"To me, I find it surprising that students who have the opportunity to live in such a beautiful place don't take it," he remarked. "They will have the opportunity to cook their own meals for the rest of their lives."
Yet on a recent morning, Sara Glassman, a 21-year-old junior from Minneapolis, relished the chance to show the two-bedroom, sixth-floor apartment that she called "an oasis above New Haven."
"It's a matter of independence," said Ms. Glassman, who chose Yale, in part, because of the residential colleges. She had lived in one for two years, enjoyed it and was ready to move into an apartment with a kitchen, a bathroom that she did not need to share with nine other students and a bedroom large enough for her desk.
True, the elevator in Ms. Glassman's building was broken, the front door was unlocked and the walls between apartments appeared thin, but none of that dimmed her enthusiasm. "This is a very in building," she said, noting that dozens of undergraduates lived there.
Another off-campus resident, Richard Kim, a junior, explained that Yale's diversity may make living in cramped quarters more challenging today than it had been a decade ago.
Take his roommates' taste in music, Mr. Kim said. "Stan listens to Gangsta Rap, Ian's into the Vh-1 scene, and I'm into the club-rave like thing. Rex is into alternative music. Any time you walk into the house, you can hear five different CD players on."
Last year in the dorms, Mr. Kim added, there was room for only one stereo, and it was not easy reaching a music consensus..
Other students complained that the dorms did not offer the amenities they had at home. On Monday night, Mr. Randall emerged from his hot tub and said that the master at his college had recently told him it would have to go.
"You have to put up with a lot of grief to stay on campus," he said.
Still, Mr. Randall said he would not move off campus. "When else in your life can you walk out your door, have 15 people walk by your door and know them all," he said. "It's the Yale experience."
It is not easy to generalize about who moves off campus. There are athletes who want to live together and cannot do it on campus because they were assigned to different colleges. There are politically active students, who want to be more in tune with New Haven.
And there are vegetarians who prefer to do their own cooking. Donnan Steele, a junior who describes himself as a "vegan," said he lost 20 pounds freshman year trying to survive on the dining hall fare.
Some at Yale worry that students are clustering into like-minded groups in off-campus apartments, weakening the heterogeneous character fostered by the college system. But others say that the students maintain their ties to their colleges and do not necessarily segregate into exclusive cliques.
Many say that they are motivated by the chance to save money. Fergus Cullen, who graduated in 1994, estimated that he saved $1,000 a semester.
Yale officials say that they bear some responsiblity for their predicament. Most of the undergraduates live in the Dwight neighborhood, west of campus, and that is the area that Yale has worked extensively to improve, placing a University police substation there, remodeling an apartment building and winning a $2.4 million Federal urban renewal grant.
The influx of undergraduates, Mr. Levin said, is "the consequence of our own success."

HEADLINE: Move to Prevent Default Stirs White House-G.O.P. Clash

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 17

 BODY:
The Clinton Administration today took the first of a series of actions meant to insure that the budget battle does not force a default on Government payments at the end of this month.
But Republican leaders immediately charged that the White House was manipulating Government finances in an effort to force Congress into raising the debt limit before the current budget battle is over. 
 At best, the tactics announced today by Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin will allow the Government to keep paying its bills for a few days into November before hitting the national debt limit, the ceiling on borrowing set by Congress. Republican leaders have said they will embed legislation raising the limit in their version of the budget, a bill President Clinton has vowed to veto.
Today's action stepped up the maneuvering, with Mr. Rubin saying that the moves will cost taxpayers in the form of higher interest rates and charging that Republicans bear the responsibility for those costs because they have brought the United States to the brink of default.
Speaker Newt Gingrich fired right back. He said late today that he had offered a short-term increase in the debt limit to Mr. Rubin, but was ignored. "We're certainly trying to work with them," he said. "They've done nothing to negotiate on this." He also said Mr. Rubin was "remarkably irresponsible" for saying that the Government would hit the debt ceiling by Oct. 31, rather than on Nov. 15, the date Mr. Gingrich said he previously understood would mark the real deadline. But a review of Mr. Rubin's public comments over the past few months shows that he has consistently said the limit would be reached by the end of October.
But beyond the politicking, Mr. Rubin is playing a delicate political and financial game, attempting to send virtually opposite messages to domestic and foreign audiences.
At home he is warning of a financial calamity, telling the Republicans that they are risking America's unblemished credit rating and forcing the Treasury to take actions that will increase the Federal Government's interest costs. But abroad, Mr. Rubin is trying to calm the waters, telling foreign investors -- who hold approximately a quarter of the Treasury's debt issues, that default is "unthinkable." The fear is that foreign investors would pull out of the market for Treasury securities rather than take the risk of being caught in a battle between Republicans and the White House, a battle in which their interest payments might be held hostage.
"This is no way for a great nation to conduct its financial affairs," Mr. Rubin wrote today in a letter to Senator Bob Dole of Kansas, the majority leader and the leading candidate for the Republican nomination for President, and to Mr. Gingrich. Congress's continued unwillingness to raise the debt limit, he warned, "is now causing disruptions, for which Congress must assume full responsibilities."
For weeks now, Mr. Rubin's staff has been spewing statistics about the cost of even a fractional increase in interest rates. Republicans say that the figures are a scare tactic: Today Senator Pete V. Domenici, the New Mexico Republican who heads the Senate Budget Committee, threatened to call Mr. Rubin to testify at hearings about just when the United States would run out of money.
The steps taken today are reminiscent of moves made during the last battle over the debt limit, during the Bush Administration in 1990. The Treasury said today that it will reduce, to $6 billion, the size of a weekly Treasury bill auction scheduled for next week. That assures that the Treasury can go ahead with a longer-term bond offering at the end of the month without hitting the debt ceiling.
Mr. Rubin also announced that until the debt limit issue is resolved, Treasury will no longer issue a special type of non-marketable securities to state and local government for "refunding," a rough equivalent to refinancing a house mortgage with a lower-rate loan. Again, Mr. Rubin said the Treasury's intent was to forestall hitting the debt limit. But by barring help to local governments, Mr. Rubin is effectively triggering some pain for Republican lawmakers back in their home districts.
"We wanted to make this real, something concrete," said a senior Treasury official involved in the planning.
In fact, few think that the United States would actually default on its debt -- something that has never happened in the country's history. But an actual default would not be necessary to rattle investors. Just the specter of default, Administration officials have said repeatedly, would scare away enough potential investors that the Government might have to raise interest rates in order to attract buyers. The cost of that move would depend on how long the stalemate with Congress dragged on.
Private economists and analysts have been preparing estimates of the ripple effect of any interest rate increases. Mitchell J. Held, managing director of research at Smith Barney, said recently that a default could lead to a sharp decline of the dollar, and an increase in interest rates of as much as half a percentage point if the standoff dragged on. But once the issue was resolved, he said, rates would bounce back and "it would be viewed as just a political exercise."

HEADLINE: Profits at Nation's Big Banks Continue to Grow Briskly

BYLINE: By SAUL HANSELL 

 BODY:
The country's biggest banking companies continued to show yesterday that their profits grew briskly in the third quarter. But there are increasing signs that the good times for banks may be coming to an end.
Citicorp, the nation's largest banking company, said yesterday that its earnings fell 2 percent, to $877 million in the third quarter, because of an increased tax rate. But its profit before taxes increased 10 percent, to $1.39 billion. Citicorp earned $1.62 a share, slightly higher than the $1.58 expected by analysts. 
 The Chemical Banking Corporation, the nation's fourth-largest bank, surprised analysts by earning $477 million in the third quarter, up 9 percent from a year ago. It earned $1.70 a share, above analysts' expectations of $1.58. Chemical's revenues were down, but its profits were bolstered by lower expenses and a lower tax rate.
Several regional banking companies, including Banc One and Wells Fargo also posted higher earnings yesterday.
"The banks are all reporting earnings in line with or better than expectations," David S. Berry, the research director at Keefe Bruyette & Woods.
At the same time, there are several signs that the favorable environment for banks may be ending. While loan volume is still increasing, the pace of growth declined at many banks, analysts said. Moreover, loan losses are edging up, particularly from consumer lending. At Banc One, for example, loan losses increased 30 percent, to $108.7 million.
"Credit quality has clearly bottomed and is rising," said Carole S. Berger, an analyst with Salomon Brothers. "It's not alarming unless unemployment starts to increase." Not all banks have been affected. At Citicorp, "Consumer credit quality appears to be stable, as you would expect with the state of the economy," Tom Jones, Citicorp's chief financial officer, said at a meeting with analysts.
The climate, however, continues to be conducive for more of the huge bank mergers that have been sweeping the industry. The strong earnings have been lifting bank stock prices, allowing acquirers to make expensive deals with their own shares. Yet the prospects of slow revenue growth and increasing loan losses are prompting smaller banks to sell out at what could be their peak prices.
Over all, while Citicorp's profits largely met analysts' expectations, the results reflected $30 million in tax benefits that were not anticipated. As a result Mr. Berry, the analyst, called the bank's performance in the quarter "a little light."
Citicorp's consumer banking business earned $522 million, up 10 percent, on strong gains in consumer branch banking worldwide and its credit card business, especially in Asia. In the United States, credit card loans increased by 19 percent from a year ago to $42 billion.
Earlier this year, Citicorp announced that it was reducing the business it does with some large companies and scaling back its assets. The effects of that plan were reflected in profits of the Global Finance division, which fell by 19 percent to $351 million. The bank's portfolio of lower-yielding commercial loans and trading securities fell by $9 billion in the quarter to $86 billion, moving quickly toward a goal of $80 billion.
Trading revenue is down from earlier this year, but even from a year ago.
Losses from bad loans increased by $70 million from the second quarter although the amount of past-due loans fell slightly.
Citicorp continued to be among the most profitable of the large banking companies, earning a return on equity of 20 percent in the quarter.
Chemical's results were dominated by lower costs rather than growth. Expenses at Chemical fell to 58 percent of its revenue compared with 63 percent a year ago, helped by a $42 million reduction in its deposit insurance premium.
Chemical posted a sharp increase in fees from corporate finance, largely reflecting its strong loan syndication and junk bond underwriting activities. Trading revenue of $213 million was the same as a year ago, but up from earlier this year.
Earnings from credit cards also increased with card loans up by 30 percent to $10.3 billion. Profits from mortgages declined, and other areas were flat.
"Almost all of the areas had improved returns," said Peter Tobin, the bank's chief financial officer. "Some from revenue growth, others from expense management."
Chemical posted above-average profitability, measured by a return on equity of 17.3 percent.
Chemical's pending merger with the Chase Manhattan Corporation will be completed early next year, pending regulatory approvals. Yesterday Chase said its third-quarter earnings fell by 7.8 percent.
Banc One, based in Columbus, Ohio, said it earned $331 million in the quarter up 17 percent from a year ago. In the 1994 period, however, the bank took a $40 million charge related to acquisition costs. The bank's operating earnings increased only 2.5 percent.
Banc One earned 83 cents a share, just better than the 82 cents predicted by analysts.
The bank said that loans increased 13.4 percent, to $69 billion, from a year go, with the fastest growth coming from credit card and real estate construction loans.
Its return on equity was a respectable 17.1 percent, up from 14.8 percent a year ago. Banc One shares closed unchanged yesterday.
Wells Fargo, of San Francisco, earned $261 million, up 20 percent for the quarter. Its per-share earnings of $5.23 well exceeded analysts expectation of $4.60. And its return on equity was a record 30.1 percent.
"Wells really blew the doors off," Ms. Berger of Salomon said. "I've never seen a bank with returns that high."

HEADLINE: As Prices Soar, Paper Becomes Precious Commodity for Schools

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: BOSTON, Oct. 17

 BODY:
At the Peter Fitzpatrick Elementary School in Pepperell, Mass., teachers get in line twice each day. Once in the morning and again at noon, they come for their daily ration of paper.
At another Massachusetts school, students write on the back of scrap paper donated by Nynex, the telephone company. 
 Around the country, paper has doubled in price in the last year, and some schools, especially in smaller districts where there is less room for budget maneuvering, are hurting for something to write on.
"In business, the paper price is passed on to the business, the business passes it on to their customers, but we can't pass it on to anybody," said Kathy Corley, principal of the Saltonstall Elementary School in Salem, Mass. "You can't say, 'Kids, bring in another $1 because paper prices have gone up.' "
At Fitzpatrick Elementary, Nancy Beringer, a third-grade teacher, said the shortage was making it hard for her pupils to practice penmanship because they were not getting enough practice on the wide-lined sheets usually handed out by teachers. "Their P's go into their L's, so it gets frustrating," she said.
Industry officials said a boom in the global economy, combined with a slowdown in the construction of paper plants, had driven paper prices up sharply. The paper market last boomed in 1989, and companies rushed to build plants, but the recession began just as many of the plants began operating, causing prices to plummet.
"We invested a lot in capacity because the economy was very good, and then we went in the tank," said Barry Polsky, a spokesman for the American Forest and Paper Association, a trade group in Washington. "So now we have to pay off the loans we took out to open those plants" instead of building new ones.
In constant 1994 dollars, copier paper cost an average of $1,028 a ton in 1989, $700 a ton in 1992 and about $1,160 this year, said Harold Cody, a San Francisco analyst who publishes The Pulp and Paper Forecaster, a newsletter.
Victor Atkins, principal of the Cashman School in Amesbury, Mass., said this year's order was never filled by his supplier, so he appealed to parents and businesses.
Nynex donated outdated stationery, and a printer donated stationery with misprints so students could write on the blank side.

HEADLINE: Political Wiretapping Scandal Reminds Estonia of Soviet Era

BYLINE: By STEPHEN KINZER 

DATELINE: TALLINN, Estonia, Oct. 17

 BODY:
A political scandal over telephone tapping that brought down the Estonian Government last week has led many people here to wonder how far the country has come from the days when Soviet police agents spied on citizens without regard to law.
Yet the fact that Prime Minister Tiit Vahi assumed responsibility for the scandal by handing in his resignation, even though he was not personally implicated, suggests that democracy is taking hold here. 
 Despite the tapping scandal and several other recent scandals that have shaken Government agencies, Estonia has gained a reputation for stability.
"Political and economic progress here has been the fastest of any former Soviet state," asserted a foreign ambassador in Tallinn. "It is commonly said that Estonia is the star pupil in the class."
The principal figure in the tapping scandal was Edgar Savisaar, one of the country's most prominent politicians. Mr. Savisaar, a one-time Communist bureaucrat, was a leader in the movement that won Estonian independence from the Soviet Union in 1991, and served as the country's first post-independence Prime Minister.
Last month, the Estonian police arrested six men who were seeking to arrange a clandestine weapons sale. One turned out to be an employee of a shadowy company called Security Intelligence Agency, which is owned by two former K.G.B. agents and, according to Estonian newspaper reports, counts underworld figures among its clients.
The police raided the company's office and found a series of tape recordings of conversations between Mr. Savisaar, who was then Interior Minister, and senior politicians including Prime Minister Vahi.
A former aide to Mr. Savisaar who worked for the company said she had made the recordings without his knowledge, but later acknowledged that this was untrue. Mr. Savisaar then admitted making the tapes, but said he had done so only to keep a record of commitments by others, and refused to resign his Cabinet post.
Angered by his refusal, Prime Minister Vahi dismissed him on the grounds that his actions were "inadmissible in a just and democratic state," and also handed in his own resignation and that of his Cabinet.
"As Prime Minister of Estonia," he explained, "I am responsible for the country's image."
In an address to the nation after the Government's resignation, President Lennart Meri called the scandal "a crisis of democracy."
"We must ask ourselves: Does power belong to the people if surveillance equipment is in the hands of others?" the President said. "And we must conclude that if this is indeed the case, the Republic of Estonia has reached a crossroads -- whether to prevail or be destroyed once again."
"Cleansing does not weaken, but strengthens the state," he added. "Watergate saved the United States of America."
Many Estonians shared the President's concern, and the press has been full of demands that politicians adopt a more stringent moral code.
"This scandal is extremely serious, and cannot be considered simply part of the growing pains of a new democracy," said Siim Kallas, a prominent member of Parliament. "We came from a society where the K.G.B. was above the law. You never knew if you were being watched or if your telephone was being tapped. People fear that the same practices still exist today, and this scandal is evidence that they do."

HEADLINE: Newburgh Is Divided Over Race Track Plans

BYLINE: By JOSEPH BERGER 

DATELINE: NEWBURGH, N.Y.

 BODY:
Richard Gayton and Ron Morehead are crazy about fast cars the way some people lose all sense of proportion over vintage wines or the Grateful Dead.
Like a Deadhead trailing his cherished band, Mr. Gayton, a 42-year-old body shop owner, travels the country on weekends to feel a familiar thrill, in his case rocketing his souped-up, logo-festooned Oldsmobile Achieva to 150 miles an hour in 9 seconds. Mr. Morehead, who owns a Volvo-Honda dealership here, has not raced since the 1970's but takes off for Gainesville, Fla., Indianapolis and beyond to follow the drag-racing exploits of his two sons and their Chevrolet Camaros. 
 "My son's winning the Grand National in 1987, I put it up there with the day my children were born and my daughter's wedding," said Mr. Morehead, who is 48.
In this economically languishing area 60 miles north of Manhattan, people like Mr. Morehead and Mr. Gayton are revved up like 500-horsepower hot rods at the news that a mysterious group of promoters wants to build a $70 million automobile race track right next door, inside the vast Stewart International Airport property. Plans call for a hotel and theater complex as well as an 80,000-seat stadium with a 2.5-mile track for stock cars and Indy cars and a half-mile drag strip.
The proposal would bring auto racing, which is perhaps the nation's fastest-growing spectator sport, into the rich New York City market; what has primarily been a regional attraction would thus be given the national sweep of baseball or football. A New York-area track -- the closest major tracks now are in Nazareth, Pa., and Long Pond, Pa., more than 100 miles away -- would join tracks being built in Los Angeles and Dallas-Fort Worth, as well as Orlando, Fla., at Disney World.
"When I thought of race tracks," said Arthur Wilcox, "I thought of a guy in a pickup truck, dungarees, a flannel shirt and a Marlboro hat." Mr. Wilcox is chairman of the Stewart Airport Commission, an advisory group that has given the proposal the green light. "But the more I looked at it, the more I realized this is a major industry," he said.
The promoter is a company called Empire State Motorsports, based in Westport, Conn. Its spokesmen are its president, Raymond DiMaria, a former freelance sports producer for ABC who specialized in "Up Close and Personal" features, and its vice president for communications, John Chuhran, a former sportswriter for Gannett Suburban Newspapers.
Supporters say the proposal could help revive the city of Newburgh, which has battled decay for decades, by generating 3,000 construction jobs, 3,000 permanent jobs and millions of tourist dollars, as well as sales taxes. It could also, they say, be the salvation of the 9,600-acre Stewart Airport property, which after 25 years of imagining itself as a fourth New York jetport remains a small regional airport surrounded by 8,000 acres of woods.
But there is strong resistance to the race track, and it stems not just from fears of noise and clogged country roads. Critics say the promoters have disclosed almost nothing about their investors. Residents worry that the promoters could flee, leaving a dead track where industry or park land might have flourished.
"Who are they?" asked George Meyers, the town supervisor of New Windsor, where most of Stewart Airport sits. "Three guys can walk into your office and tell you anything."
How can two men who earned their living in the news business attempt a project like this?
Mr. DiMaria, a Long Islander who gives his age as 40 plus, says that his family has long sponsored drag racing and that several times during the last eight years he has tried unsuccessfully to stage a Grand Prix outside the Nassau Coliseum. Mr. Chuhran says he worked in public relations for two years for Championship Auto Racing Teams, the sanctioning body for the bullet-shaped, ground-hugging Indy cars.
They say their backers can afford to spend the $70 million for a track plus $7 million for a ramp from Interstate 84 that would enable spectators to reach the track without flooding rural roads. But they say they fear that people might overcharge their backers if they are identified.
"If you're going to buy a piece of real estate and, say, you want $30,000 and he finds out you're worth a million," Mr. DiMaria said, "well, the price of poker just went up."
In recent days, Mr. Chuhran has identified Gerald Katell, a major commercial real estate developer in Los Angeles, as a partner. Mr. DiMaria says the investors will prove their wherewithal before construction starts by buying a performance bond -- an insurance company guarantee that they have enough resources to complete the work.
The project won approval Aug. 29 from the Stewart Airport Commission to start engineering and environmental analyses on a 360-acre site. That decision remains to be acted on by the state's Department of Transportation, which operates Stewart. But an important player will be the State Department of Economic Development, whose spokesman, John Melia, says Empire State Motorsports has yet to submit any concrete financial information.
A lot of money may be riding on a decision.
Professional car races drew a paid attendance of 14.3 million last year. The stock car industry alone has tripled attendance in 15 years and generates $2 billion a year in revenue. As a result of this mushrooming market and growing television broadcasts, companies like Tide, Eastman Kodak and Goodyear are eager to pay the $5 million it can cost to operate a stock car and turn the cars themselves into speeding billboards for their products.
The promoters, however, have received no assurances that the major sanctioning bodies would add Stewart to their schedules. Kevin Triplett, spokesman for the National Association for Stock Car Auto Racing, said the year's schedule of 34 weekend races was already at capacity. But, he admitted, when faced with a concrete proposal from the nation's largest media market, "it would be very difficult to say no."
"You find the rock and you find the hard place and we'll be there," he said.
Another major question is whether car racing will be popular in New York, where most people are accustomed to racing only to the subway or bus. The promoters are banking on a broadening appeal for the sport, pointing out that the racing fan's average income of $42,000 is greater than the national average and that one-third of fans are women.
More than 12,000 Hudson Valley residents have signed a petition supporting the Empire State project, many of them from the valley's racing subculture.
"Can you imagine a run-down place like Newburgh getting pumped $20 million in three days?" Mr. Morehead asked. "There's nothing here. Who wants to raise his kids and see them leave the area because there's nothing here?"

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS;
Some Try to Insure Against a Japan Bank Failure

BYLINE: By SHERYL WuDUNN 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Oct. 17

 BODY:
When international bankers have nightmares these days, they have nothing to do with ghosts or goblins, but with the liquidity of the Japanese banking system.
Bankers here say that plans by Federal Reserve authorities in the United States to pour emergency funds into the Japanese banking system in the event of a crisis will help bankers sleep better. They say that the plan will ease concerns about a lack of liquidity -- the ability to settle debts when they come due -- but they add that the underlying problems remain as a long-term challenge. 
 "This is sort of like a nuclear deterrent," S. David Snoddy, a bank analyst at Jardine Fleming Securities Tokyo, said of the bailout plan. "The reason you have it is so you never have to use it. It's designed to reassure the market."
But the involvement of the Federal Reserve also has a downside: is may be bringing more attention to the liquidity problems of Japanese banks.
While analysts praise the rescue plan disclosed on Monday, which would infuse funds into banks if they ran short of money, they also warned that Japan's financial system was still stuck with several practical problems. These include hundreds of billions of dollars worth of bad debts, chronic dollar shortages, higher costs for overseas money, and a dim outlook.
In the 1980's, Japanese banks used to be considered among the world's strongest, able to tap funds worldwide at the lowest prices.
But these days, the fear is that if banks are not given credit they are counting on, they might not have enough money to meet their obligations. The result is that they could default on a contractual requirement to honor foreign-exchange trading transactions or swap transactions, or to meet other obligations.
Such a default could ripple through the world banking system, affecting liquidity at other banks and conceivably setting off further defaults. Another fear is that in a crisis, Japanese may dump Treasury bonds or other American assets, raising interest rates and creating dislocations in the American money markets and the overall economy.
Those concerns are leading bankers to curb credit -- and to worry about the effects as they do so.
Almost everyone interviewed emphasized that a major banking crisis was very unlikely.
Yet in the last few weeks, some Japanese institutional investors have grown so concerned that they are looking for ways to buy a form of insurance to protect themselves, to hedge against a plunge in the value of the bank stocks they hold, according to bankers here. Japanese financial institutions often hold large blocks of stock in banks with whom they have close ties or cross-shareholdings.
Selling these holdings is not feasible because this would both offend the banks and send stock prices plummeting. So the Japanese institutional investors are taking the unusual step of quietly, almost secretly, inquiring about buying put options against the bank whose stock they hold. A put option is a bet that the underlying stock will fall within a certain period; its value soars when the stock plunges.
Some of the puts are for periods as long as three years. That suggests that the purchasers believe it will be several years before the banks are out of the woods.
Their concern no doubt arises from what they see: Not only are weaker Japanese institutions tapping stronger banks for dollars, but they have to pay a "Japan premium" when they borrow funds abroad. Indeed, some banks are finding that borrowing is now so expensive that they can get dollars more cheaply by taking their yen deposits to the foreign-exchange markets and converting them to dollars.
In other cases, banks are finding that their credit lines have been trimmed, so that they cannot borrow funds abroad at any price.
The Japanese Government refused today to comment on any arrangement with American authorities, but it has said that there was no reason for alarm about the risks of tighter credit. Some analysts say the international concern is an overreaction to what the Government estimates is at least $500 billion in bad real estate loans, about one-third of which are unrecoverable.
Various Japanese bankers have said that the Government is already providing a disguised form of assistance to struggling banks. They said that the nation's central bank, which manages foreign-exchange reserves, sometimes parks some of those funds as deposits at Japanese banks, which can then be used to finance overseas commitments, aiding liquidity.
The central bank declined to comment on the practice.
The amount of Japan's asset holdings -- including its foreign reserves, which totaled $179 billion at the end of September -- gives foreign bankers some measure of comfort in the Government's ability, in theory, to stem any liquidity squeeze. Japanese authorities have said that they will not allow any of Japan's largest money-center banks to fail, and many foreign analysts say the Government probably means what it says.
The problem, however, is that the Finance Ministry has not yet worked out a bailout scheme that it could turn to immediately in a crisis.
"I have a worry, a concern, regarding a financial panic," said Yukiko Ohara, a banking analyst at UBS Securities Japan Ltd. "The system is very vulnerable to increasing overseas concern."

HEADLINE: COMPANY REPORTS;
G.M. Surprise: Profit Beats Expectations

BYLINE: By JAMES BENNET 

DATELINE: DETROIT, Oct. 17

 BODY:
A year ago, the General Motors Corporation reported surprisingly little profit for the third quarter. Investors gasped, and then stampeded.
Today, G.M. surprised auto analysts with third-quarter earnings far higher than they expected. But as the auto giant eagerly described its turnaround, investors, mesmerized by slicker high-technology stocks, only yawned. 
 These days, with auto companies predicting little if any growth in the United States or in Europe next year, it seems to take the threat of a hostile takeover to lift an auto company's stock.
By contrast, I.B.M. -- which last year delighted Wall Street on the same day G.M. disappointed it -- reported a weak quarter today. Yet its stock still surged, apparently caught up in the wave of buying that swept through technology issues. [Page D2.]
Today's report showed that G.M. is continuing to untangle its knotted North American automotive operations. Although production of cars and trucks increased in the quarter, G.M. reported that its costs for materials and overtime dropped substantially, cutting the loss incurred a year ago in North America.
Over all, G.M., the world's biggest auto maker, reported third-quarter net income of $642 million, up 16.3 percent from last year's level of $552 million. In North America, G.M. lost $93 million, well below a loss of $363 million last year.
Worldwide, G.M.'s revenue increased 8.6 percent, to $37.5 billion. The earnings came to 42 cents a share, up from 40 cents last year.
Most analysts had expected that G.M. would post a decline in earnings. Despite the pleasant surprise, G.M. shares closed at $46.50, unchanged on the day, in tepid trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
"More and more, what investors are thinking is that this is a no-growth business," said Maryann Keller, an auto industry analyst with Furman Selz in New York. "The picture of the auto market is one of limited growth for now, with bottom-line improvement coming from more effective cost control." That outlook, she said, is not "the kind of thing that gets your blood surging."
The Big Three auto makers say that the Federal Reserve has successfully engineered a soft landing for the economy. G.M., for example, predicts that the auto companies will sell about 15.3 million vehicles in the United States in 1995, 100,000 fewer than last year. For 1996, G.M. expects the market to grow, but only about 2 percent, J. Michael Losh, G.M.'s chief financial officer, said today.
While it may dampen investors' enthusiasm, the market's stability is clearly allowing G.M. breathing room to improve its efficiency and strengthen its balance sheet, judging by today's report. As it straightened out last year's botched new-car introductions at its factories, G.M. increased its share of the car and truck market in the United States, to 32.2 percent in the quarter from 31.5 percent in last year's third quarter.
G.M. had an advantage over its domestic competitors in the quarter because it did not have major model changeovers. The Ford Motor Company, which has introduced a new version of its Taurus sedan, is expected to post sharply lower earnings on Wednesday. Last Wednesday, the Chrysler Corporation reported that its net income dropped 46 percent in the third quarter, to $354 million, largely because of the introduction of its new mini-van.
In North America, G.M.'s losses narrowed. "The biggest year-to-year gain is from the improvements in terms of material costs," Mr. Losh said. Pension expense also dropped. And G.M. said its overtime costs fell by $100 a unit, or about $118 million.
Costs incurred by G.M. in offering customers incentives to buy cars also declined, to an average of $671 a vehicle from $935 last year. That is substantially lower than Chrysler's average of $870 in the third quarter. Mr. Losh said he expected G.M.'s incentive costs in the fourth quarter to remain about the same as in the third.
G.M.'s international operations lost ground in the quarter with profits falling to $111 million from $232 million in the third quarter last year.

Reports of Economic Easing Give Lift to Prices of Bonds

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
The prices of Treasury securities ended mostly higher yesterday.
The 30-year bond's price rose 11/32, to 108. Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, fell to 6.28 percent, from 6.30 percent on Monday. It was the lowest yield since Feb. 2, 1994. 
 Traders attributed some of the rally in the cash and futures markets to the Johnson Redbook report on retail sales, released yesterday, which was favorable for the market. The report said that sales for the first two weeks of October were down 1.9 percent from the previous period.
In the day's other economic news, the Federal Reserve said that capacity utilization at the nation's factories fell to 83.9 percent in September from 84.2 percent in August, while industrial production fell 0.2 percent in September, after a 1.1 percent rise in August. All three reports fit the description of an economy that the bond market likes: slow to moderate growth, with few inflationary pressures.
The Treasury announced that it was selling $19 billion in new three- and six-month bills on Monday, down $7 billion from the previous two auctions. Some market participants believe that the reduction in the size of the weekly auction may have to do with the issue of raising the nation's debt ceiling, which is still being hammered out in Congress.
Carroll J. Delaney, director of research at Stires, O'Donnell & Company, said, "In order to penetrate the formidable 6.25 percent resistance level for 30-year bonds, the market will need further, substantial evidence of much weaker economic growth, or the completion of a comprehensive, credible and gimmick-proof budget-reduction agreement."
He said he thought that at the very least, the Treasury market needed to pause and consolidate before the next major price yield swing was determined.
He also said that yields could rise if there were a major jump in the Philadelphia Federal Reserve Bank's index of regional business activity, which is to be reported tomorrow, or a larger-than-expected announcement on the size of the auction of two- and five-year notes next week. That will be announced today.
The price of the December bond futures contract, which touched a new high of 117 23/32 in the morning, eased in the afternoon. It was the third time in four sessions that the contract hit a new high. The futures market opened above the previous day's high of 117 16/32 and rallied immediately to the new level, which apparently gave the market jitters as some participants had difficulty believing that the rally could remain intact, traders said.
In the municipal bond market, prices were little changed as New York City sold $945 million in bonds with yields as high as those offered by some Treasury securities.
Money managers said many investors skirted the secondary market to get at the attractive yields on the New York sale. Prudential Securities tentatively priced the bond with a 30-year maturity to yield 6.30 percent, but good investor demand allowed underwriters to get a better price and to lower the yield by about 5 basis points. A basis point is equal to one one-hundredth of a percentage point. Serial bonds were priced to yield from 4.20 percent for an issue due in 1997 to 6.15 percent for one due in 2016. A bond due in 2020 was priced to yield 6.20 percent.
City officials said they had received $2.6 billion in orders for the overall issue, allowing them to increase its size.
The bonds are rated Baa-1 by Moody's Investors Service and BBB+ by Standard & Poor's.

HEADLINE: The Fulton Fish Market Battle

 BODY:
Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's bold drive to end mob domination of New York City's Fulton Fish Market has entered a critical phase and deserves strong public support. The city has begun a new first-come, first-served system for unloading delivery trucks at the bustling wholesale fish and seafood distribution center in lower Manhattan. This is intended to replace the old system under which unlicensed crews, setting their own rules, were free to extract payoffs and inflated fees for prompt unloading of perishable cargo.
The first day of the new system produced chaos. There were long unloading delays, disrupting business and virtually halting the flow of seafood to local restaurants. One cause was the inexperience of the company to which the city had awarded a two-year unloading contract. The drivers who bring seafood from as far away as the Gulf of Mexico complained that the new crews were incompetent. 
 But there was also a deliberate effort to sabotage the cleanup, clearly engineered by organized crime elements fighting to hold their turf. Someone tampered with the master light switches, plunging the market into darkness. Hundreds of workers, mainly employees of the market's 60 wholesale seafood vendors, staged a wildcat strike to show solidarity with the 40 workers who lost their jobs when the city evicted the six unloading companies. Officials have charged that all six are linked to organized crime and have routinely engaged in extortion simply by refusing to unload the fish quickly unless the wholesalers paid exorbitant fees.
A large portion of the estimated two million pounds of fish that flow into the market on a normal workday went undelivered Monday morning, and almost nothing was sold because few buyers for restaurants and retail stores could penetrate the truck congestion, the forbidding darkness and the intimidating swirl of protesters.
Yesterday Mr. Giuliani showed his resolve by issuing a stern warning and sending in more police. He has threatened to shut the place down if another wildcat strike occurs. He has also threatened to replace the existing work force if necessary, to install honest management and to end the intimidation that has driven up fish prices and driven wholesalers to other markets on the East Coast.
More turbulence may lie ahead. In March, the market was set ablaze by an arsonist. The Mayor is clearly facing a rough crowd eager to maintain its economic stranglehold. But Mr. Giuliani has the right background and instincts to stand up to the mob. He can be counted on to stay the course. The bully boys of the market have had their way for too long, at everyone else's expense.
Ending the atmosphere of intimidation is critical not just for the market's economic future but for the city's business climate generally.

HEADLINE: Aid for the World's Poorest

 BODY:
The new Republican majority in Congress wants to eliminate government services that private markets could also provide. Yet it has aimed its budget knife at a valuable program -- economic aid to the world's poorest countries -- that could not possibly survive without Federal funds. Drastic cuts approved by the House and Senate threaten to grind dreadfully poor people into deeper poverty.
Under President Bush's leadership, the United States committed itself to contributing about $1.3 billion next year to the International Development Association, an affiliate of the World Bank that provides very-low-interest loans to poor countries. As part of its deficit reduction program, the House and Senate want to renege on that commitment and reduce the contribution to between $577 million, the House figure, and $775 million, the Senate's figure. 
 Neither figure makes fiscal or ethical sense. The I.D.A. loan program is cost-effective. Every dollar in American contributions leads to $4 or $5 more in contributions from other industrialized countries. To save a few hundred million out of a $10 billion-plus foreign aid budget, Congress would trigger a $3 billion reduction in I.D.A. loans.
The loan program is also politically effective. By inviting poor countries to open their economies to trade and adopt market reforms, I.D.A. loans are a cheap way for Congress to spread capitalism. The program's multilateral nature insulates recipient countries from pressures to warp their economic programs to suit the narrow export interests of individual donors. I.D.A. programs worked well in Korea, Thailand, Turkey and Indonesia. They are working well in Ghana and Bolivia.
Critics of the I.D.A. say that third-world countries would become more prosperous more rapidly if they relied more on private capital and far less on World Bank handouts. This criticism applied, at least until recently, to World Bank loans for dams and other infrastructure projects. As the new president of the World Bank concedes, private capital markets are willing and able to extend such loans. But private investors will not bail out sub-Saharan Africa and other economic disasters. Over 70 percent of private lending to developing nations goes to fewer than a dozen countries. Sub-Saharan Africa claims only 2 percent.
The I.D.A., not private capital, fights the spread of AIDS. The I.D.A. helps pay for schools. The I.D.A. finances women's health and childhood nutrition programs. The World Bank has shifted its priorities from investing in concrete to investing in people. No one else can take on this role. Do American taxpayers really prefer to save themselves about $2 a year rather than leading the world to help those eking out an existence on less than $2 a day?

HEADLINE: Journal;
Fixated on Farrakhan

BYLINE: By FRANK RICH 

 BODY:
At a time when white Americans can't agree among ourselves on anything, here at last is one opinion that unites us all, liberal and conservative, Democrat and Republican, rich and poor: Louis Farrakhan is a hate-filled demagogue with a divisive, separatist ideology and an appalling record of racism, sexism, anti-Semitism and homophobia.
This judgment is to my mind as indisputable as it is unoriginal, and nothing happened at Monday's march to alter it. Mr. Farrakhan's efforts to strike a benign pose were fatally compromised by his speech's lunatic digressions into crypto-mysticism and self-deification. His offer to open a dialogue with Jews was cynical and meaningless, given his refusal to acknowledge his history of hate speech, let alone apologize for it. His retinue of brownshirts injected the chilling trappings of fascism into an event otherwise resplendent in spirituality and peace. 
 So white America agrees: Louis Farrakhan is up to no good. But now that we've all said that as loud as we can, where do we go next? Should we keep saying it over and over, louder and louder, and hope that Mr. Farrakhan will just go away?
Apparently so, our politicians tell us. Monday began with President Clinton firmly denouncing Mr. Farrakhan and ended with Bob Dole and Newt Gingrich both following suit and attacking Mr. Clinton for not denouncing Mr. Farrakhan by name. Perhaps tomorrow Phil Gramm will accompany his attack on Mr. Farrakhan with an attack on Mr. Dole for not attacking Mr. Farrakhan at greater length.
This game can be played indefinitely with short-term political profit, since no white candidate is ever going to lose by decrying the Nation of Islam. But what exactly is being accomplished? Yes, Mr. Farrakhan is a menace and must be watched vigilantly. Still, white America makes a fetish of him at its own peril.
The pre-march attacks on Mr. Farrakhan did nothing to deter 400,000 African-Americans, only a minority of whom support the Nation of Islam, from turning up in Washington to express their impassioned desire to stem the economic and social collapse of their own communities. Now that the march is history, attacks on Mr. Farrakhan are not going to erase the powerful and substantive message of most of its participants. By continuing to fixate on Mr. Farrakhan, rather than the legitimate concerns of the 400,000 marchers, white politicians only give their nemesis more credibility and power. It is the failure of the entire political establishment to heed the spiraling crisis of the black underclass in the first place that gave the extremist Mr. Farrakhan his opening to seize a resonant mainstream issue as his own.
That opening keeps getting larger. In the two weeks of racial turmoil that have fallen between the O. J. Simpson verdict and Monday's march, the paralysis of white political leadership has been embarrassingly pronounced. The verdict that preoccupied most Americans yielded only some cautious homilies from President Clinton in a newspaper interview and shilly-shallying from most of the Republican field. At last week's forum of G.O.P. Presidential candidates, a visitor from Mars might never have guessed that the O. J. verdict had rocked the country or that the Million Man March was in the offing; there was so little talk about Topics A and B that Jack Kemp chided his fellow Republicans for muffing "an incredible opportunity to step into the vacuum."
Mr. Clinton, at least, did give a thoughtful address on both white and black racism -- but from the remote perch of Austin on Monday, just as the Million Man March hit its stride at the Mall. Is it leadership to give such a speech in lockstep with Mr. Farrakhan's event rather than a step or two ahead of it? The healing, philosophic long view of Mr. Clinton's remarks seemed out of sync with the moment anyway -- more appropriate to the inflammatory immediate aftermath of the Simpson verdict than to the day of the march. And since the speech offered no specific policies, the only sound bite in it not drowned out by Mr. Farrakhan in the evening news was, inevitably, the attack on Mr. Farrakhan.
Well, Mr. Farrakhan is a bad guy, all right. But if this is the sole message white America can send to black America in the wake of the Million Man March, his reign has only begun.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Flight Away From French Franc Continues to Undermine Dollar

BYLINE: By Reuters 

 BODY:
The dollar slipped against most leading currencies yesterday for the second consecutive day as economic uncertainty in France continued to steer currency traders toward selling francs for dollars and then selling those dollars for German marks.
The French National Assembly began to debate the 1996 budget yesterday. Some analysts questioned whether the French Government can cut spending enough to help shrink its budget deficit. 
 "The Government's credibility has been damaged because they are already anywhere from 20 to 40 billion French francs under target on the revenue side for the current fiscal year," said David Gilmore, a partner at Foreign Exchange Analytics. "There is natural concern in the French Parliament that much the same will be seen in 1996."
Because of such concerns, traders are skeptical that France will be able meet the criteria for a single European currency in 1999. As a result, traders shifted from French francs into German marks.
In New York trading late yesterday, the dollar slipped to 100.41 Japanese yen from 100.63 yen on Monday. The dollar fell to 1.4147 marks from 1.4235 marks and to 1.1480 Swiss francs from 1.1543 Swiss francs. The British pound slipped to $1.5731 from $1.5740.
The French franc traded in New York at 3.5092 francs to the mark, weaker than 3.4868 late Monday in New York. The mark was also bolstered against the French franc yesterday by continuing fallout from the Bank of France's surprising move on Monday to cut its 24-hour lending rate to 7 percent, from 7.25 percent. Only last week, the central bank had increased the rate to 7.25 percent from 6.15 percent to bolster the franc.
The rate cut "may give the impression they are not prepared for a prolonged interest rate defense of the franc," said Malcolm Barr, an economist with Chemical Bank.
Growing uncertainty about whether the White House and the Republican-led Congress will be able to strike a deal on the budget hurt the dollar.
The White House chief of staff, Leon E. Panetta, reiterated during a news conference yesterday that President Clinton would veto any balanced-budget plan he found unacceptable, even if it contained a necessary increase in the debt ceiling.
"Any negative news on the budget is not going to be very dollar supportive at all, especially with the dollar trading at the low end of its trading range," said Stephen Flanagan, a vice president and and senior foreign exchange dealer at Credit Agricole in New York.

HEADLINE: Industrial Output Down In September

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 17

 BODY:
Industrial output declined for the first time in five months during September as cool weather curbed electricity consumption, the Federal Reserve reported today.
Production decreased two-tenths of 1 percent. Output at factories alone increased two-tenths of 1 percent, but that was not enough to offset a 5.4 percent drop in utility output. 
 Industrial production had increased 1.1 percent in August, when hot weather kept power demand high.
In today's report, the Federal Reserve also said that factories operated at 83.8 percent of capacity in September, down from a revised 84.2 percent in August.
All told, the data did little to change the outlook for slow growth and tame inflation.
 "The manufacturing sector is far from smoking here, but it is making advances," said John Ryding, an economist at Bear, Stearns & Company in New York. September's drop in output, he said, "is not a sign of weakness, it's a sign of cooler weather."
 The decline in production was bigger than the consensus forecast among economists for a decrease of only one-tenth of 1 percent. Still, the data did not appear weak enough to strengthen the case for another interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve when its policy-making committee meets on Nov. 15.
Analysts have been divided about whether the Fed will cut rates again at that meeting, or at the following meeting, on Dec. 19. At meetings in August and September, Fed officials took no immediate action on interest rates.
 The decline in the rate of factory use bodes well for slower inflation. The rising use of factories, mines and utilities tends to contribute to higher costs because businesses are forced to pay workers overtime and bring older and less efficient equipment on line.
 "The Fed is on the sidelines waiting for the Federal budget negotiations to clear up," said Scott Brown, an economist at Raymond James & Associates in St. Petersburg, Fla. Once that hurdle is removed, Mr. Brown said, the Fed is likely to lower rates to bolster economic growth.
 A rate cut would be justified because "the economy is not firing on all cylinders at the same time," Mr. Brown said.
 Excluding the output of motor vehicles and parts, today's report showed, industrial production increased four-tenths of 1 percent in September after rising 1.2 percent during August. Mining output climbed six-tenths of 1 percent in September.

HEADLINE: Real Estate;
Rockefeller Center lands a tenant, Siegel & Gale, to take the entire third floor at 10 Rockefeller Plaza.

BYLINE: By Mervyn Rothstein 

 BODY:
IN the largest deal at Rockefeller Center since the owners of the Manhattan landmark filed for bankruptcy protection in May, Siegel & Gale, the corporate identity and communications company, has taken 51,000 square feet, the entire third floor, at 10 Rockefeller Plaza.
Robert Saporito, Siegel & Gale's chief financial officer, said the bankruptcy was "helpful to our deal" and had worked in his company's favor. 
 The lease for the space, between 48th and 49th Street, is for 21 years and totals $45 million, reflecting an average annual rent in the low $30's a square foot, Mr. Saporito said. The company is to move early next year from space on two floors at 1185 Avenue of the Americas, near 47th Street. The new offices are just above the studios of NBC's "Today" show, in a 17-story building that was formerly the Eastern Airlines Building.
Stuart I. Romanoff of Cushman & Wakefield, who with a colleague, Donald A. DiRenzo Sr., represented Siegel & Gale in the deal, said the primary concern had been "tenant-improvement dollars." A key to the agreement, Mr. Saporito said, is the more than $2 million the company is to receive in financial considerations from the landlord to design its new space and create an alpine rock garden on the terrace that wraps around the third floor.
He said negotiations had begun before the bankruptcy filing, which took place after Siegel & Gale had agreed on a base rent but before the lease was signed. "The bankruptcy was something we had to consider," he said, "but in the long run we were given priority by Rockefeller Center because we were their biggest deal since the bankruptcy."
In an article in Siegel & Gale's in-house publication, Mr. Saporito said that Rockefeller Center needed "to show that they're still in business, still making deals, and that they can still provide construction money to sweeten the deal." He said that without the bankruptcy "they wouldn't have given us all the concessions that they have."
Alan L. Stein, senior vice president for marketing at the Rockefeller Center Management Corporation, said that the "fundamental economic terms of the transaction were unaffected by the bankruptcy" and that the "financial incentive package would have been the same with or without bankruptcy."
The landlord contribution, Mr. Stein said, "was appropriate for the space, the creditworthiness of the tenant and the rent the tenant is paying." He said that because a third-floor space did not have the views that higher space had, it was important to spend money to beautify the terrace. The vacancy rate at the 16 buildings owned by Rockefeller Center is 6.9 percent, he said.
Mr. Saporito said that the site offered the flexibility and high ceilings his company had been seeking. Siegel & Gale wanted its staff of 110 people on one floor because it felt that working on separate floors hindered collaboration, he added.
 
Flatiron Area Grows
 Retail growth in the Flatiron District continues. The Limited Inc. has leased 8,200 square feet at 130 Fifth Avenue, in a former Chemical Bank site at 18th Street, where it plans to open its 12th Express store in Manhattan. And Aveda, a Minneapolis-based international beauty emporium, has taken 1,000 square feet a block north, at 140 Fifth.
They will join Armani, Kenneth Cole, Joan & David, the Gap, Banana Republic, 9 West and other stores that have flocked to Fifth Avenue below 23d Street and made it a thriving shopping area.
"The Limited was looking for some time to do a store in the Flatiron District," said Benjamin Fox of New Spectrum Realty Services, who with the Georgetown Group represented The Limited.
 
New Jersey Buildings Bought
 In what brokers say is the largest commercial real estate deal of the 1990's in New Jersey based on square footage, the Lincoln Equities Group of Garden City, L.I., has bought three buildings totaling 816,681 square feet.
The deal involves the Meadows Office Complex in the Meadowlands in East Rutherford -- two 12-story buildings, a total of 571,876 square feet, 92 percent occupied -- and the fully leased 244,805-square-foot Rockaway 80 in Rockaway in Morris County.
The price was "in excess of $54 million," said Sean Brady of the Financial Services Group of Cushman & Wakefield of New Jersey, who with an associate, David Bernhaut, handled the transaction for Lincoln Equities, which develops and invests in properties in the New York region.

HEADLINE: The Chandelier That Earned $1.5 Billion

BYLINE: By DINITIA SMITH 

DATELINE: HARTFORD, Conn.

 BODY:
Above the stage of Bushnell Memorial Hall, the giant chandelier was swaying to the music like some weighty sea creature. From the wings came the plaintive cry of the Phantom: "I a-m your a-a-n-gel of mu-usic . . . " The downtown streets of this city are usually empty after dark. But for a month and a half recently, nearly 2,500 people showed up six nights a week at the Bushnell to see what may be one of the most successful shows of all time: "The Phantom of the Opera."
Since it opened in London nine years ago, Andrew Lloyd Webber's musical about a lovesick loner in the Paris Opera has played some 27,000 performances in nearly 60 cities around the world, from Singapore to Basel to St. Paul. 
 Along the way, "Phantom" has grossed $1.5 billion, outearning even the most successful movie ever made, "Jurassic Park." Another Andrew Lloyd Webber musical, "Cats," has made more money than "Phantom," so far, but it has been playing longer and its touring days are waning. The grosses of "Phantom" are about equal to another blockbuster, "Les Miserables." However, more people have come to see "Phantom" than "Les Miserables." The "Phantom" tour is booked through 1998, and it may outstrip both its competitors.
" 'Phantom' has played in larger theaters and has run longer in most places than any other show in modern history," said Cameron Mackintosh, the producer of "Phantom," "Les Miserables" and "Cats."
" 'Phantom' sells itself easier than any other show I have ever worked on, or known about."
In Toronto, "Phantom" has been performed for six years and has grossed $325 million. "It is a monster!" said Garth Drabinsky, the show's Canadian producer. "It is the king of all shows."
In an era in which movies dominate American culture, what is it about this musical with a hero who has a face like melted cheese, and a 1,000-pound chandelier for second lead, that lures audiences in droves, including people who rarely go to the theater? It's certainly not the reviews. When "Phantom" opened in New York in 1988, critics generally jeered at its banal lyrics, the impoverishment of its music, its Liberace-like homage to the candelabra and the chandelier, its kitsch.
Even Mr. Lloyd Webber can't really explain the show's success. "I started from the premise of wanting to write something that was a high romance," he said. "It doesn't stand up to huge intellectual scrutiny. There's no one who doesn't feel they wish they hadn't been born different, that their fingers were longer, or something. At the end of the day, it's overwhelmingly high romance."
Rocco Landesman, the producer and president of Jujamcyn Theaters, and a rival of Mr. Webber's, has sat for seven years at his desk opposite the Majestic Theater on Broadway at 44th Street, watching the crowds flock to "Phantom" even in late summer and mid-winter, chronically slow periods. "I've been very depressed about it," Mr. Landesman said with a laugh the other day.
He attributed the show's success to the public's "primal response to live theater."
"People like the mythic story of 'Phantom,' of the innocent girl and a mentor," he said. "But the success of the show has a lot to do with its theatricality; you can't see that on film. When that chandelier moves down over the stage, imagine that on TV: it would be meaningless!"
" 'Evita,' " said Mr. Landesman, mentioning another Lloyd Webber musical, "is not as embracing and appealing. 'Les Miserables' is more of a downer. 'Phantom' is a real romantic story. 'Phantom' is more thrilling than 'Cats.' "
So strong is the desire to bring in "Phantom" that communities are willing, even eager, to spend significant sums to accommodate the lavish production. According to the show's technical production manager, John H. Paull 3d, "theaters routinely spend $50,000 to $100,000 in structural steel modifications each, just to drop the chandelier."
To lure "Phantom" here to Hartford, where it just completed its run, the Bushnell undertook a major capital campaign, raising $3 million from the state, businesses and individuals to renovate the theater, which was built in 1930. The stage also had to be reinforced so that the 1,000-pound chandelier could plummet at the end of Act I, and to hold the two-and-a-half-ton portable proscenium.
In Salt Lake City, John Ballard, a local presenter, said he had been "begging" for "Phantom" and had spent $200,000 modifying the Capitol Theater. The show is coming next March.
The producers of "Phantom" say all that money is a good investment. For every dollar spent on tickets, they claim, at least $2 goes back into the local economy, for dinners out, tuxedo rentals, baby sitters.
In Denver, where "Phantom" played from November 1991 to February 1992, 177,103 people -- from 6 surrounding counties, 43 states, Canada and Austria -- saw the show in the downtown district. According to a study by the Denver Center for the Performing Arts, assisted by the Greater Denver Chamber of Commerce and others, the show grossed more than $19 million. But its impact on the local economy was more than $40 million.
With its grand orchestral strokes, its arias with their melting tessitura, its flashing strobe lights, the 550 pounds of dry ice it consumes each night for the foggy scenes under the Paris Opera, "Phantom" appears to be the perfect theatrical vehicle.
In the United States, there are no fewer than four "Phantom" companies: on Broadway, in San Francisco and two on tour. Each of the touring companies is equipped with 28 trucks to transport the show's stage decks, prosceniums, 230 costumes, 150 wigs and 479 spotlights. There are duplicate sets so that companies can leapfrog across the country; the cast that was in Hartford, where the show closed on Oct. 7, went into previews in Providence, R.I., five days later.
"We've got it down," said Alan Wasser, the show's general manager. "If we're moving a distance of less than 800 miles, we can close on Saturday and open in the next city on Tuesday."
In some ways, "Phantom" is more about scenery and effects than actors or story. Unlike other musicals, the leading role is not identified with any one star. The "Phantom" is not a face. He is a mask. In the past, Broadway musicals required a singer with a big voice that carried. Now, because of portable microphones, "Phantom" doesn't need a major star to sing the role. All of this makes touring easier. In Hartford, the Phantom was played by Thomas James O'Leary, who also played the role on Broadway, after Michael Crawford (he also played Monsieur Andre and Monsieur Reyer). Adrienne McEwan, a trained operatic soprano, was the ingenue, Christine Daae.
To make sure the music is up to standard, Mr. Lloyd Webber employs a full-time staff of musical supervisors who travel from London to Basel to Cleveland checking on "Phantom" productions. "It's the first time a show like this has toured without compromising Broadway," said Mr. Wasser. And in most cities, audiences are paying close to top prices for tickets too. In Hartford, the best tickets cost $60; on Broadway, they're $67.50.
The producers of "Phantom" have followed the same techniques as the producers of traveling shows at the turn of the century, reassuring audiences that they are getting the real thing, not a second-rate copy of a New York production. Just as touring companies in the 1880's and 90's were preceded by notices in local newspapers and billboards describing the cost, spectacle and authenticity of the show to come, publicists for "Phantom" supply local journalists with statistics on everything from the number of beads on the chandelier (35,000) to the number of AAA batteries used each night in the portable mikes (about 25).
At the end of the first act in Hartford one night recently, the Phantom -- as usual -- was growing increasingly jealous about Christine's relationship with the second lead, Raoul. "He was bo-ound to love yoooo . . . " sang the Phantom. Above the stage, the lights on the chandelier flashed a warning. Then, suddenly, the chandelier, all 1,000 pounds of it, crashed down over the audience, missing them by a few feet before it was pulled up again.
The crowd interrupted the orchestra's descending line with applause. It was as if they had been waiting forever for this moment, carefully publicized by the show's producers in local newspapers before the show ever came to town.
"Awesome," said 12-year-old Daniel Kushner. "I'd rather come here than go to a movie."

HEADLINE: BOOKS OF THE TIMES;
The Sad Story of the Sioux's Betrayal

BYLINE: By RICHARD BERNSTEIN 

 BODY:

A GOOD YEAR TO DIE
The Story of the Great Sioux War
By Charles M. Robinson 3d
412 pages. Random House. $27.50.
The story told by Charles M. Robinson in "A Good Year To Die" rests on two sad truths. The first is that the Fort Laramie Treaty, signed in 1868 between the United States Government and the tribes of the Sioux Nation, recognized a vast tract of territory in southern Montana and northern Wyoming to be "unceded land." This was land that in effect still belonged to the Indians and that no white person had the right to settle or even cross without Indian permission. That unceded land was in addition to the half of South Dakota west of the Missouri River, which the treaty designated the Sioux Reservation. 
 The second sad truth is that the Great Sioux War of 1876-77, was fought a mere six years after the treaty was signed. The United States, reneging on the agreement, drove the Indians off the unceded land and forced them to give up their right to exclusive use of the reservation as well. In 1874, gold was discovered in the Black Hills. Prospectors and others rushed to the territory. Efforts to buy the land back from the Indians for $6 million were rejected. And so, urged on by military commanders like Philip Henry Sheridan of Civil War fame, the United States, under President Ulysses S. Grant, embarked on a military expedition to destroy Sioux power for the sake of American economic expansion.
Mr. Robinson's book is a detailed account of the arduous, dreary and morally dubious military campaign that ensued as the United States Army, after some attempts that are legendary for their ineffectiveness, eventually defeated such warriors as Crazy Horse and Sitting Bull, thereby effectively ending not just the Sioux's independent power but their way of life as well. It is a sobering story, one that Mr. Robinson, the author of several books on the Old West, tells with scrupulous fairness to both sides. Histories of the Indian wars formerly described events from the Government's point of view only, and Mr. Robinson's use of Indian accounts to portray life inside the Sioux camp are part of a welcome trend to write a more complete and balanced history.
Unfortunately, however, "A Good Year to Die" never really comes to life as a historical panorama. Mr. Robinson details just about every event in the campaign against the Sioux. He describes every skirmish, names every commander and gives a bit of background information on the major participants, white and Sioux, including Indian chiefs like Black Elk, Red Cloud and Wooden Leg. He talks about the Army's most famous Indian fighters, like Alfred H. Terry, Ranald Mackenzie and, most famous of all, George Armstrong Custer. When an army unit sets out into the field, Mr. Robinson identifies every unit and how many men are in each. On the Indian side, if four scouts are sent out to reconnoiter enemy positions, Mr. Robinson tells us the names of all four.
This makes for a complete and dutiful account, unvarnished by romanticism or melodrama. But the historical figures in the drama remain strangely featureless and undeveloped despite Mr. Robinson's efforts to enumerate their qualities and eccentricities. The military actions, which were almost all small, blend into a blur of hard marching, dreary endurance and brief battles. The book's well-drawn maps show the main army campaigns against the Sioux, most of which took place along the rivers of the unceded territory. Still, the reader is left puzzling over some skirmishes that are fuzzy in his text.
But there are lessons to be drawn from Mr. Robinson's account, not least of them that the Great Sioux War was not very great. It was more of a wilderness police action than a full war. The entire post-Civil War Army was limited by Congress to 25,000 soldiers. Forces on either side in the conflict rarely amounted to more than several hundred combatants. The total Government dead in the war was 283, the majority of them lost in the famed showdown between Custer and Crazy Horse at the Little Big Horn. Indian casualties, while no doubt greater, are not known. In the end, what defeated the Indians was less enemy firepower than economic destitution. Kept under constant pressure by United States troops, the Sioux were unable to replenish their supplies. After incredible hardship and privation, they finally had to give up or perish.
In this sense, Mr. Robinson early on strikes the right theme: that the Great Sioux War marked the inevitable end of a way of life in North America and its replacement with a kind of sedentary dependence on the white man's bureaucracy. White settlement had made the Plains Indian culture, which required easy access to open spaces and seasonal hunting, impossible to sustain. The war was the last, futile resistance to the rules of white society by charismatic chiefs like Crazy Horse. The final holdout, Sitting Bull, who briefly escaped to Canada rather than become a reservation Indian, did come back to the United States voluntarily. He ended his glorious warrior's career as a performer in Buffalo Bill's Wild West Show, learning to write his signature so he could sign autographs for a fee.
"We are weak compared with you and your forces," one Indian leader, Little Chief, told the Government commander who accepted the Sioux surrender. "We are out of ammunition; we cannot make a rifle, a round of ammunition or a knife; in fact we are at the mercy of those who are taking possession of our country."

Japan's Trade Surplus Narrowed in the Year's First Half

BYLINE: Reuters 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Wednesday, Oct. 18

 BODY:
Japan's huge trade surplus narrowed to $56.19 billion in the first half of this fiscal year from a revised $59.21 billion in the comparable period a year earlier, the Finance Ministry said today.
Despite the 5.1 percent drop, the surplus was still large enough to help push the dollar below 100 yen briefly after the release of the numbers. The American currency later rebounded back over that figure, helped by what bankers said was intervention in the foreign-exchange market by the Bank of Japan. Late today in Tokyo, the dollar was trading at 100.34 yen. 
 Tokyo's politically sensitive trade surplus with the United States fell 13.9 percent, to $23.32 billion, in the six months through September, from $27.08 billion a year earlier. For September alone, the surplus was $4.42 billion with the United States.
A Ministry of Finance official said the figures showed that the surplus was continuing on its downward course of the last few months.
"Basically, our trade surplus is on a declining trend," he said. "We hope that the surplus will decline further with the implementation of Government economic stimulus packages such as the one announced on Sept. 20."
In September alone, Japan's overall trade surplus fell to $11.29 billion from a revised $11.96 billion a year earlier, marking a third straight month of year-over-year declines. In August, the surplus stood at $5.97 billion.
The September surplus exceeded some economists' forecasts of $9.7 billion to $10.6 billion, partly reflecting the recent weakness of the Japanese currency. But others expected the larger number.
"I was not surprised to see the figure," said Tetsuro Sawano, an economist at the Nikko Research Center.
Yuichi Matsushita, manager of global strategy at Nikko Securities, said, "The decreasing trend in the surplus is still on its way, and we foresee fiscal 1995-96 will be a much smaller number than several years ago, so we don't worry about a further possible increase in the trade balance."
The yen has fallen sharply from a high of 79.75 to the dollar in April to near its level of a year ago. As a result, the yen has lost its previous effect in raising the dollar-based value of Japanese exports, economists have said.
With the volume of imports tending to grow at a much faster pace than that of exports, the shrinking trend in the surplus will stay solid for the time being, economists said.

HEADLINE: Themes From a March Resonate

BYLINE: By KAREN DE WITT 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 17

 BODY:
Monday, Lavale Thomas attended the Million Man March. Today, he was in Marsha Karim's pre-law class at Eastern High School here telling a room full of rapt students how he put entrepreneurship to work for himself.
"Part of the inspirational message of the march was to keep economic power within the black community," said Mr. Thomas, who owns Kidd-Kard Services, a company that makes identification cards for pre-schoolers and day care centers in Atlanta. "I want you to know there is an alternative to the streets." 
 It was a message the students were eager to absorb. Their questions came thick and fast: How did you get a loan? Was it harder for a black man to get banks to lend money than a white man? Would blacks buy from other blacks? What did he give back to the community?
Mr. Thomas, a former Green Bay Packer running back, said building a business was sometimes tough, but that perseverance paid off. Talking about it to students, he said, was one way he contributed to the community -- along with donating a portion of his profits to schools where he lives. Mr. Thomas went to the school at the invitation of his cousin Reynauld Smith, a social studies teacher there.
"We used to look to the Government for all the answers," interrupted Mr. Smith. "But we can't say: 'give me,' 'help me,' 'I need' anymore. We have to start asking the question: 'What can each and every one of us do to help our community?' "
Many in the class, which offers early training for students interested in careers in the law, had attended the march. They said they were inspired, empowered, awed and excited about the possibilities ignited by the gathering of thousands of black men on the Mall for a day of atonement called by Louis Farrakhan, the leader of the Nation of Islam.
It was a sentiment repeated all over the city today -- from a group of black bicycle couriers to office workers and taxi cab drivers. Like the adults, the students had diverse views about it. "It felt so good to see them together," said Jamanea Gunter, 15, of the marchers.
"I didn't think it was going to be such a success," said Zeaneteria Starks, 16.
Cedrece Watson, 15, was put off by the concentration of news reports on Mr. Farrakhan.
But Kalimah Adbul-Sabur, 17, said there was nothing wrong with what Mr. Farrakhan had said. "It's like some people don't want to hear that they've made mistakes," she said. "We as black people have made mistakes. But others, it's like they know it but don't want to hear it."
They paused to ponder what they themselves could do. Many of them come from neighborhoods wracked with crime. Nearly all knew someone who was dead or in prison.
Jamilla James, 16, her voice cracking with emotion, talked about her own neighborhood where "you see drug dealers running all day long" and how she spent her efforts on keeping a brother away from their lure.
"I don't want my little brother, who is 12, to get caught up in that," she said. "So I try to keep him busy, keep him involved in his homework, keep him cleaning the house. I tell him that he can ask me anything."
An older brother is in jail, she said, and had "gotten off track, but he talks to me and I try to support him, too."
Martrelle Pyatt, 16, said her family made a special effort to support the men in the family. When someone found a job listed in the newspaper that was in the suburbs but did not have the money to travel for an interview or to get lunch, the family would pitch in.
Ilandus Swinson, 15, who had attended the march, said he had heard the message of how important it was to respect women. "When they tick me off now, I won't use the B word," said Mr. Swinson. "If I'm tempted, I'll just pray to the Lord."
"B word?" "B word?" "What's the B word?" echoed around the class to laughter.
Shana Potter, 16, said she would demand more respect from the young men and try to rise above the "petty differences" that often annoyed her.
"I'll just focus on my career," she said. "I plan to be an attorney, then a judge."
The class offered a time of mutual confidences between the young people and the adults. Ms. Karim told about her black, white and Native American heritage, about the inspiration at the 1968 civil rights march led by the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and her disillusionment with the United States in the wake of his death. She told the students that she had once so despaired of race relations in the United States that she considered leaving the country. Instead, she said, she found her inspiration in teaching in the community where she lived.
Eric Love, 16, had attended the march, but said he wondered why every issue in the country always was tinged with racial overtones.
"I still want to see that day when just people can come together," he said.

HEADLINE: After March, Lawmakers Seek Commission on Race Relations

BYLINE: By STEVEN A. HOLMES 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 17

 BODY:
Seeking to build on the momentum generated by Monday's rally of hundreds of thousands of black men in Washington, six members of Congress today asked President Clinton to appoint a national commission on race relations, while Louis Farrakhan, who organized the gathering, suggested that the event had made him a force on the national scene.
"I know you do not know me," Mr. Farrakhan, the leader of the Nation of Islam, said at a news conference, "but I know you will get to know me. And you're going to have to live with me. To some, I am a nightmare. But to others, I am a dream come true." 
 With the memories of Monday's rally fresh in their minds, politicians, academics and civil rights leaders groped today to find meaning in the Million Man March, wondering if it represented a watershed in race relations or a one-day love-in with no lasting effect.
Commentators, intellectuals and others agreed that the rally, coming in the aftermath of the divisive acquittal of O. J. Simpson on murder charges, focused the attention of the nation's leaders on the subject of race as no recent events have. And indeed, the two events prompted extensive statements by President Clinton and Speaker Newt Gingrich.
What was clear was that the event -- which, the Park Police said, drew a throng of 400,000 to the nation's capital -- captured the attention of much of the country. Officials at the Cable News Network said today that 2.2 million households tuned in to Mr. Farrakhan's rambling and complex speech -- meaning that more people watched the two-hour-long address on CNN than any other speech this year, including Mr. Clinton's State of the Union Message and the Pope's address to the United Nations.
"We got the kind of numbers that basic cable only sees for first-run movies," said Howard Polskin, a vice president at CNN.
And it was equally clear that the event elevated Mr. Farrakhan's standing and posed a dilemma for traditional civil rights organizations.
At today's news conference, the Rev. Benjamin F. Chavis Jr., who helped organize the event, said he would convene a meeting of the National African American Leadership Summit -- a coalition that has included the Nation of Islam -- next month to plan a political and economic agenda that would seize upon the momentum built from the march. Mr. Chavis invited groups like the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, the National Urban League and the National Baptist Convention, which declined to endorse the march, to participate in next month's meeting.
In doing so, he placed these groups in the same vexing position they were in before Monday's rally: Either shun Mr. Farrakhan or embrace an effort that will include him and risk alienating white, especially Jewish, supporters.
Today, six members of the House wrote Mr. Clinton urging him to appoint a bipartisan commission to study race relations in the United States since the 1960's and to then make recommendations for improvements. The lawmakers said they envisioned a panel similar to the Kerner Commission, which in 1968 issued a report concluding that the United States was "moving towards two societies, one black, one white -- separate and unequal."
The biracial, bipartisan group of members of Congress who asked that the commission be appointed were: Representatives Charles E. Schumer and Charles B. Rangel, Democrats of New York; Delegate Eleanor Holmes Norton, Democrat of the District of Columbia; Representative John Lewis, Democrat of Georgia; Representative Jim Leach, Republican of Iowa, and Representative Bill McCollum, Republican of Florida.
But even as the group was pleading for steps to build understanding between blacks and whites, organizers of Monday's rally were accusing the Park Service of racism and of deliberately underestimating the size of the crowd at 400,000.
At his news conference today, Mr. Farrakhan said that "racism, white supremacy, and the hatred of Louis Farrakhan disallows them to give us credit" for breaking the record for the largest crowd to ever gather on the Mall. The record was set by the 1964 inauguration of President Lyndon B. Johnson, which attracted 1.2 million people to the Mall.
Officials with the Nation of Islam threatened a lawsuit to force the Park Service to issue what they insisted was the true number of the size of crowd.
The squabbling over the size of the crowd threatened to draw attention from an event that people from the far ends of the political spectrum agreed was a milestone.
The rally prompted Mr. Clinton to give a major address on race relations at the University of Texas at Austin in which he chided blacks and whites to "clean their houses" of racism. The peaceful march also drew comments from Mr. Gingrich.
"The march ought to be a wake-up call for all of America," Mr. Gingrich told a group of conservatives who were celebrating the 10th anniversary of Radio America on Monday night. "And, in a wonderful irony, typical of American history, all of us owe Louis Farrakhan a thank you for having told all of us, if the pain level is great enough for him to be a leader, then we all have a lot bigger challenge to lead."
But beyond agreeing that the rally caused the country to think about race relations -- at least for one day -- there was little consensus on whether the event, with its twin calls for blacks to take more responsibility for their actions and for the country to atone for its sins against blacks, would produce much change.
"Obviously, a lot of goodwill was built yesterday," said Hugh Price, president of the National Urban League. "It was a very spiritual experience and there is quite a good chance that it will be built into increased responsibility, changed behavior and heightened engagement in civic life on the part of black men."
But others were not so sure. Some said that while a change in the behavior of many black men would go a long way toward solving some of the problems of the inner city, it was not the only answer.
Glenn Loury, a black conservative economist, said he was impressed by the rally and its themes. But he was caught up short when asked if it would have any lasting effect.
"Be better fathers and better husbands," said Mr. Loury, a professor of economics at Boston University. "It all sounds kind of empty when you say it out loud. It makes sense and these things should be done. But it doesn't sound like much of a program."
The discussion over the rally's significance went beyond the country's intellectual elite.
As drug dealers plied their wares nearby, Eugene Hampton, 28, and Lamont Beckham, 55, got into a spirited argument on a bench in Wilson Park in Compton, Calif., an economically depressed city south of Los Angeles.
"He's a good role model for the generation to come and the young people my age," Mr. Hampton said of Mr. Farrakhan.
But Mr. Beckham would have none of it. "To me, Farrakhan is mostly out for himself, not for blacks, and that's the way I think," he said. "And to me, he has a personal thing about the Jews, and there are some statements he never should have said about them."
Mr. Beckham was also unimpressed by Mr. Farrakhan's speech. "It's the same things he was saying in the 60's, it's just that a new generation hasn't heard it before," he said.

Turkey's Premier Asked To Form a Government

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: ANKARA, Turkey, Oct. 17

 BODY:
Turkey's President asked Prime Minister Tansu Ciller to form a new government today, a day after she resigned because Parliament rejected her old one.
President Suleyman Demirel asked Mrs. Ciller to stay on after she patched together a partnership with the Republican People's Party on Monday. The center-left party had belonged to Mrs. Ciller's original governing coalition, but bolted last month over her economic austerity plan. 
 Mrs. Ciller formed a minority government after the coalition collapsed, but it failed on Sunday to win a vote of confidence.
Mr. Demirel canceled an official visit to Washington this week because of the political crisis, which erupted over Mrs. Ciller's austerity program.

HEADLINE: On an Oasis in New York Harbor, a Bittersweet Salute

BYLINE: By RANDY KENNEDY 

 BODY:
When Capt. Kevin Ray first heard eight years ago that he would be transferred from his Coast Guard posting in New Orleans to Governors Island, at the foot of Manhattan, his heart plummeted like an anchor.
"When I looked at the set of orders," he said yesterday, "I thought, 'I'm going to have to slit my wrists.' New York? I had absolutely no desire to come to this city." 
 But as word spread around the hushed, campus-like haven of Governors Island that the Coast Guard had decided on Monday to close the base after 29 years and to disperse the island's residents as early as next summer, Captain Ray allowed that there were more than a few things he would miss about a place "that quickly grew on me."
"And what's not to like?" he said. For four years his quarters have been an elegant 100-year-old red-brick Victorian mansion, built for the Army officers who inhabited the island before him, with a makeshift woodworking shop set up in the basement and an attic bedroom offering an extraordinary view of Manhattan's downtown skyline.
"I will never again, I think, live in a house the likes of the one I live in now," he said yesterday in his office.
Captain Ray, who is not a golfer, said he might even miss harvesting the golf balls that seem to collect in his front yard, just a slice away from the first tee at the base's popular nine-hole golf course. "There are so many aspects of this place that are unique, like a very small town in the heart of the biggest city," he said.
In the offices and on the narrow streets of the island the Dutch called Nooten Eylandt, or Nut Island, because of its thick groves of chestnut trees, there were many who echoed Captain Ray's sentiments yesterday. They said that while they had never been exactly enamored of the busy city that loomed on the horizon, they had grown to love their life on the island, in a cloistered community that seemed somehow plucked from a forgotten America, more Andy Griffith than Kojak or Seinfeld.
"Because they predominantly come from small-unit backgrounds -- we operate in smaller communities -- New York City is a bit of a change for many of our people," said Capt. James D. Garrison, the deputy commander of the Coast Guard's Maintenance and Logistics Command Atlantic, during a news conference to announce the closing.
But the island itself, said Lieut. John Shallman, the Coast Guard's spokesman on the island, "is a place where people don't lock their cars and many of them don't lock their apartments." It is a place where a ticket to see a first-run movie at the base's theater still costs only $2, and where many officers eat lunch at home with their families, because home is often just a few hundred feet from the office down a cobblestone street.
"We are a self-sufficient community, with schools and restaurants and housing and virtually everything we need right here," said Lieutenant Shallman, who added that he knew people who had not set foot off the island for years, except for a trip out of the state or country.
It is exactly this self-sufficiency, though, that led to the Coast Guard's decision to close the base -- the largest piece of a plan to reduce overall spending by $400 million over the next four years. Because the base is on an island, the Coast Guard had to provide all the municipal services that its personnel needed to live there, at an operational cost of about $54 million a year.
More than 1,000 Coast Guard members will soon be transferred to bases in Tidewater, Va., and Charleston, S.C., "where our people can live on the economy, and we don't have to provide these services," Captain Garrison said. Most of the personnel will be transferred out by next summer, and the island, owned by the Federal Government, will be fully turned over to the General Services Administration by 1998.
While the closing is a disappointment to Coast Guard personnel, many of whom will have to uproot their children from the island's school, Public School 26, and leave their historic residences behind, it will be even harder for many civilian employees, for whom the decision is essentially a pink slip. As many as 250 of the island's 700 employees are expected to be laid off as the base's operations dwindle in the next three years, officials said.
"Twenty years ago when you went to work for the Government, the one thing you were sure of was job security," said Richard T. Kenney, a civilian maritime relations officer who also worked at two other military complexes, the Brooklyn Army Terminal and the Brooklyn Navy Yard, when they were shuttered. " And now it's one of the shakier jobs you can have."
As they worked and talked with each other about the news, several members of the Coast Guard said that one of their only regrets about the closing was that they were leaving behind a piece of real estate that could end up being fiercely fought over by developers and turned into a playground for the rich.
"It was kind of nice, living in a place where so many people are probably envious of your views and your space in this crowded city," said Lieut. (j.g.) Charlene Ditty, an engineering officer.
But she added that the "novelty of New York" quickly wore off for her and her husband, also in the Coast Guard, and they are more than ready to leave.
And there are also those like Seaman Arizona Guastaferro, 21, who came to the base from a 270-foot cutter stationed in New Bedford, Mass., for whom the closing holds no emotional overtones at all, except perhaps relief.
"When I came here, I thought this was the most depressing place I'd ever seen, sort of gloomy" said Seaman Guastaferro, who works for the base newspaper. "It's like a small town where everyone knows what you did before you even do it, you know?"
After nearly a year on the island, he said, "I'm going to be happy to get back out into the real world again."

HEADLINE: Monthly Gap In U.S. Trade Down Sharply; Exports Surge

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 18

 BODY:
A surge in exports cut the nation's trade deficit sharply in August, to $8.8 billion, the smallest monthly gap so far in a year of generally expanding deficits, the Commerce Department reported today.
The unexpectedly strong sales abroad buoyed the dollar in world currency markets today and led analysts to raise estimates for growth in the economy during the third quarter. Exports reached a record despite a lack of significant growth for some major trading partners; imports were essentially flat. 
 The $2.4 billion narrowing in August was almost entirely the result of higher exports of American merchandise, mainly civilian aircraft, computer accessories, semiconductors and automotive products. There was virtually no change in exports of services or in imports of goods or services.
"We are encouraged by the bounce in exports," said Robert E. Mellman, an economist at Morgan Guaranty, which now predicts that gross domestic product will post a 2.7 percent rate of expansion when the Commerce Department publishes its first estimate of third quarter growth at the end of next week. The bank, citing a rise in inventories reported earlier in the week, had been expecting G.D.P. to rise at a 2 percent pace.
The Clinton Administration was quick to boast of the much narrower August deficit, which was accompanied by a $300 million downward revision for July.
"Obviously, we're encouraged -- it's export led," Mickey Kantor, the United States trade representative, said in a telephone interview from Jerusalem, where he announced an agreement with Israel to expand sales of American farm products. He also noted that goods exported over the last 12 months grew 15.7 percent, thereby surpassing the growth of imports, which was 15.4 percent.
Western Europe, however, accounted for nearly all of the smaller trade gap in August as the deficit with Japan was essentially unchanged at $5.1 billion and the deficit with China grew by $600 million, to $3.9 billion.
The ever-rising imbalance with China, now 77 percent as large as the American deficit with Japan, compared with 56 percent in August 1994, aroused Administration concern.
"It is disturbing to see that again our trade deficit with China increased," Commerce Secretary Ronald H. Brown declared in a statement from Hong Kong. Mr. Brown had just completed a series of meetings in Beijing in which he expressed the Administration's "firm commitment" to a better balance in economic relations.
Despite the lower August trade gap, economists here noted that the deficit so far this year still ran 17 percent higher than the swollen 1994 pace and would no doubt exceed last year's total of $106.2 billion.
Looking back over the last several months, said Michael P. Niemira, economist at the Mitsubishi Bank in New York, "we're seeing a slowdown both on the export and import side." Both categories, the department's figures show, declined in June and July.
Over all, the United States registered a $13.8 billion deficit on goods, which was partly offset by a $5 billion surplus from such services as tourism, insurance and royalties.
Exports climbed 3.7 percent in August, to a record $65.7 billion, more than making up for declines of 1.5 percent in June and 1.8 percent in July. Imports, reflecting subdued demand from a moderately expanding American economy, held steady at $74.5 billion.
While the Administration pointed to a fifth consecutive month of narrowing in the deficit with Japan, the change in August was so small as to disappear in the rounding, at $5.1 billion. Imports of Japanese cars, however, edged down $200 million.
Japan reported its own trade figures today, showing an overall surplus for September at $11.29 billion, down from a revised $11.96 billion a year earlier. In trade with just the United States, Japan said it ran a surplus of $4.42 billion, down from $5.82 billion a year ago. For the first half of the fiscal year, through September, Japan's overall surplus narrowed to $56.19 billion, from a revised $59.21 billion a year earlier.
United States exports to Mexico, which are about 10 percent lower this year because of that country's economic crisis, perked up in August to help trim the American deficit $200 million, to $1.1 billion. The deficit with Canada, meanwhile, widened $400 million, to $1.6 billion. Unlike the aggregate figures, those for individual countries are not adjusted for recurring seasonal variation.
The deficit with Western Europe contracted sharply -- to $769 million from $3.1 billion in July. The United States experienced either smaller deficits or higher surpluses with all 10 of the listed countries, the biggest changes being with Germany and Belgium followed by Italy, the Netherlands and Sweden.
On a three-month moving average, the American trade deficit declined to $10.4 billion from $11.1 billion, today's report also showed.
For advanced technology products, the August surplus climbed to $672 million from $252 million in July, but it was only half what it had been in June.

HEADLINE: G.O.P. LAWMAKERS SCRAMBLE TO PASS A MEDICARE PLAN

BYLINE: By ADAM CLYMER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 18

 BODY:
On the eve of a crucially important Medicare vote, House Republicans today opened a vote-trading bazaar to line up a majority and joined their Senate allies in accusing the Clinton Administration of playing political games with the national debt.
After tinkering with Medicare allowances for rural areas and dealing with complaints about other measures, from lobbying to nursing-home payments, the Republicans expressed confidence that they had persuaded enough doubters to pass their Medicare proposal on Thursday. [Page B12.] 
 Although Speaker Newt Gingrich cheerfully described the bargaining as "a little bit like Christmas shopping," his closed-door efforts were the most serious business of the day. Medicare is the bloodiest political battlefield of this fall's budget wars, and the first test of the Republican effort to balance the budget by the year 2002.
Even so, there was plenty of time for intense posturing over the national debt, as each side demanded that the other abandon political advantage for the sake of the national interest. All day long the White House and Mr. Gingrich traded offers and non-offers, and then charges and countercharges, on a temporary increase in the debt limit.
The Treasury Department calculates that an increase must be enacted by early November, when, it says, the Government will reach its current, $4.9 trillion ceiling on public borrowing.
But Mr. Gingrich, after suggesting a temporary debt-limit increase that would allow Congress and the White House time to try to resolve their differences over the 1996 budget, backed off and complained that the Administration was playing political games.
"We have no belief the Treasury has accurate figures," he said. "I want to look at the facts. Who knows what the truth is? I don't have a clue."
The Senate majority leader, Bob Dole of Kansas, agreed, although a little less forcefully. He said he was not "trying to cause any calamity in the Government," but insisted that the Administration "stop playing games."
The Administration responded with confused disappointment from Michael D. McCurry, White House press secretary, who said of the Republicans, "It's impossible to predict where they're going to be from one moment to the next, you know." The White House chief of staff, Leon E. Panetta, offered regretful exasperation, saying, "I don't think the game-playing on the debt ceiling is a responsible thing to do."
The Republicans had an easier time with a gleeful celebration of a remark, delivered on Tuesday night at a Houston fund raiser, in which President Clinton said he thought he had raised taxes too much.
The Republicans interrupted a session of the Senate Finance Committee, which was trying to pass a $245 billion tax-cut measure, to offer unusual congratulations to the President. "I have to say maybe I agree with President Clinton this time," said the chairman, Senator William V. Roth Jr. of Delaware.
The committee, delayed by Democratic objections, worked into the night on the tax cut before deciding to recess for the evening and reconvene on Thursday. The measure, whose main element would give a $500-a-child tax credit to most families, has the support of all the Republicans on the committee and will probably go to the full Senate for a vote later this month. It will be part of the budget reconciliation bill, which will also include reductions in the growth of entitlements like Medicare and Medicaid.
"We're here to reduce taxes," Mr. Roth declared, "for the purpose of creating growth."
But Democrats held that cutting taxes was bad policy, especially when it was being done in conjunction with lower spending for Medicare, Medicaid, education and other Government programs.
The Senate measure follows the general path of even deeper tax reductions approved by the House last April. But the Senate proposal differs from the House bill in several important respects, which will have to be resolved in a House-Senate conference before the budget reconciliation bill can go to Mr. Clinton. These are the major differences:
The Senate bill would give the $500-a-child tax credit to single parents with annual taxable incomes up to $75,000 and to couples with incomes up to $110,000. The House bill would allow parents with adjusted gross incomes up to $200,000 to claim the credit.
Like the House bill, the Senate bill would reduce the top tax rate on capital gains, the profits from the sale of investments, to 19.8 percent for individuals, from the current 28 percent. But the senators did not accept a House provision that wouldallow the value of investments to be adjusted annually for inflation.
The Senate measure would not lift the maximum income a retiree could earn without forfeiting some Social Security benefits; nor would it repeal a provision, enacted in 1993, that increased the portion of middle- and upper-income retirees' Social Security benefits that is subject to taxation. The House bill would take both these steps.
The senators did not go along with House-passed provisions that would repeal the alternative minimum tax, for wealthy taxpayers with large write-offs. Nor did they agree with the House plan to give businesses a more favorable schedule for depreciating their investments in plants and machinery.
Like the tax cut, the Republicans' Medicare proposal drew heavy fire from the Administration again today. In renewing a threat by Mr. Clinton to veto the entire budget reconciliation bill, Alice M. Rivlin, director of the White House Office of Management and Budget, attacked its "deep, unwarranted cuts in Medicare that would raise costs for beneficiaries and sharply cut payments to providers, jeopardizing access to, and the quality of, care."
In a letter to Representative Gerald B. H. Solomon, the New York Republican who heads the House Rules Committee, Ms. Rivlin said, "The President has made it clear that he will veto any reconciliation bill that includes Medicare" cuts of that size.
Undaunted, Republicans went ahead with intense tinkering on the Medicare bill today. As Mr. Gingrich observed, "Any time you are in the last 48 hours before a major vote, 17 people show up who suddenly figure out you need their vote and they have this one thing they haven't gotten yet."
Seventeen is indeed a crucial figure. If 17 Republicans defect on Thursday, and if no Democrat crosses party lines to vote for the bill, it will be defeated.
Responding to complaints by Representatives from rural areas, for example, Mr. Gingrich engineered an increase in the amount that health plans in less populated counties would be guaranteed when they enlist elderly Americans in managed care, a major goal of the bill. Such plans had been promised no more than $200 a month, but the bill was changed to guarantee them at least $250. Even so, rural lawmakers said that was still not enough, and some were saying they would oppose the bill.
Another major change was made to that part of the reconciliation bill that deals with Medicaid, the Federal-state program that pays medical costs for the poor, the disabled and thousands of elderly nursing home residents.
As originally drafted, the bill would have allowed states to seize money and property from the spouses and adult children of nursing home patients to pay for their care before any Medicaid money would have gone to help them. Current law prohibits tapping the resources of spouses and adult children, and the latest revision would continue that practice.
Representative Thomas S. Bliley, the Virginia Republican who heads the House Commerce Committee, announced this reversal from the bitterly protested provision in the bill that his committee had approved.
"In the Commerce Committee, we pride ourselves on our ability to listen and to make improvements in legislation when called for," he said in a statement. "We should not risk a single American going to the poorhouse just because a spouse or parent had to enter a nursing home."


GRAPHIC: President Clinton and Congressional Republicans have some simple disagreements over the budget. But they are being played out in very complicated ways, as both sides engage in a high-stakes game of chicken over the laws governing the nation's ability to borrow money. Here are some of the terms and factors in the debt debate.
 
Deficit: Each year's overspending by the Government -- revenues minus spending. The Government covers this shortfall by borrowing money -- issuing Treasury bills, notes and bonds.
 
Debt: The accumulation of borrowing to cover those yearly deficits, plus interest.
 
Debt ceiling: A statutory limit on the amount of money the Federal Government may borrow to finance deficits. The limit must be approved by both houses of Congress. Right now, the debt ceiling is $4.9 trillion. The debt is expected to reach that level around Oct. 31, according to the Treasury Department.
 
Hitting the ceiling: When the debt ceiling is reached, the Government would be unable to issue new Treasury notes to raise the revenue needed to write checks -- for everything from Social Security payments to paper clips for the Pentagon. The problem is particularly acute at this time of year, when the I.R.S. is bringing in relatively little revenue.
 
Temporary increase: A stopgap increase in the debt limit, for days or weeks.
 
Default: Failure to pay debts when due, and a lot will be due soon. On Nov. 15, the Treasury must pay $25 billion in interest and $33 billion in principal on Treasury bills coming due that day. The next day, $44 billion more comes due. The United States has never defaulted on its debts and the Treasury Secretary, Robert E. Rubin, has repeatedly called the possibility "unthinkable."
 
Rescheduling: Despite Mr. Rubin's confidence that default can be avoided, he has begun taking steps to postpone the crunch. Even as he does so, he and others are worrying that such preparations or the threat of default could frighten investors, particularly the foreigners who hold roughly 25 percent of U.S. debt. As a result, the Government might have to pay more interest to attract purchasers of government bonds. (pg. B12)

HEADLINE: Million Man March Puzzles a Houston Suburb

BYLINE: By SAM HOWE VERHOVEK 

DATELINE: CHANNELVIEW, Tex., Oct. 18

 BODY:
"Get out, get a job, take care of your family, and don't kill people," said Tracie Bratton, offering her own distillation of the theme from the Million Man March in Washington.
"Now that's a good message," added Mrs. Bratton, who caught grainy glimpses of Monday's huge rally on the small black-and-white television here at Hauck's Hair Haven, a beauty salon where she works. "Who in the world is going to disagree with a message like that? But what I don't understand is, why did they direct it only at black men? I mean, they should have opened it to all men." 
 Like a lot of white people here in this largely white, working-class outpost of the Houston area, the 30-year-old Mrs. Bratton freely admits that there are a lot of things about race relations these days that she just does not understand.
Not the appeal of Louis Farrakhan, the leader of both the march and the Nation of Islam. Nor the jubilation so many black people seemed to feel at the acquittal of O. J. Simpson. Nor the reason for all those black men to get together and express black pride or black anger or "what, exactly, this rally was supposed to be all about" in Mrs. Bratton's words.
"It's unnecessary, really," added one of her customers, Anna Baize, 24, a bartender whose hair was wrapped in tight curls for a perm. "I thought all that was over in the 1960's. It's like, get a life."
No place in America can offer a perfect snapshot of white attitudes about race relations. But this blue-collar town, home to chemical refineries, polyethylene plants and an infamous woman accused of trying to murder the mother of her daughter's chief cheerleading rival a few years back, does offer a look at the gulf suggested in many polls between how many white Americans and black Americans view everything from Mr. Simpson's trial to the need for affirmative action.
Many white people here, for instance, present it as a matter of indisputable fact that black people can get jobs more easily than whites these days. And while many white residents here went out of their way to express benign sentiments about Monday's rally and its aftermath, many of their comments could be construed as doubled-edged -- patronizing, or worse -- and may thus illustrate the very racial divide that they say should be erased.
"There could have been a riot," said 36-year-old Julius Honeycutt, a ponytailed man who works as a machine operator at a plastic bottle plant here. "It was a success because nobody got hurt. That's the way I look at it."
At the lunch break at the construction site for a new high school, a group of white electricians, all from Channelview or nearby towns, found themselves in disagreement over what the march and its message might accomplish.
"I think it was good," said Tim Savell, 38, an expressive man wearing jeans and work boots, who said he had "no problems" with a blacks-only rally. "The point was, blacks should be more responsible. If they get off welfare, that's going to help all of us out. And let's face it, many of the problems are in black neighborhoods. There are kids in the ghettoes who don't have any fathers. There are high death rates for youths. Drugs. The prisons are full of blacks."
But Wayne Garrett, 49, said the march was little more than an empty publicity stunt.
"I'm not sure it's going to change black people at all," he said, shaking his head. "The point was to see how many people they could get together, show how many votes they have.
"But as soon as they get back home," he continued, "they're going to be back on food stamps, back on welfare. Blacks are always talking about discrimination -- the white man is doing this, the white man is doing that. It's everybody's fault but theirs. I don't think that's going to change."
Dwayne Phillips, 24, another electrician at the construction site, said he liked the message but was appalled at the chief messenger, Mr. Farrakhan.
"He's as prejudicial as they come, trashing the Jews and everything," Mr. Phillips said. "They picked the wrong guy. It's like Pee Wee Herman selling Nike shoes or something. That's not going to work. You need a Michael Jordan."
The other white workers nodded in agreement but quickly fell into dispute over who the best black preacher for black self-reliance would be. Mr. Phillips suggested the Rev. Jesse Jackson, a choice met with several side-to-side "no" headshakes from colleagues. Gen. Colin L. Powell got a few "yes" nods.
"Martin Luther King was probably the best man for the job," offered Mr. Savell. "But he's dead."
Even as speakers and marchers at Monday's rally talked about the lack of economic opportunity for black men, many of the whites here seemed to have a startlingly different view.
"What makes any of this a black issue?" said Mrs. Bratton, the hairdresser. "There are whites, Chinese, Mexicans that are poor.
"It's an issue for them -- yes, if not more so than blacks," she said. "If you have three men applying for a job -- a black man, a Hispanic man and a white man -- it's pretty much always going to be the black man gets the job because he's black. Don't ask me who made the rules. That just seems to be the way it is these days."
Miss Baize, her customer, also said she detected a racially tinged double standard in the fact that the blacks-only rally even took place on public property.
"If a white man had led a rally like this, people would have had a fit," she said. "In fact, it wouldn't have been allowed. Black men have a rally, and it's all about black pride. But if whites had a rally, it'd be, 'Uh-oh, it's the Ku Klux Klan.' "
Although only 15 miles from Houston, which is a racially mixed city and the country's fourth largest, Channelview is an insular world of tidy ranch houses and mobile homes.
It has been the scene of calamities -- a compressor explosion at a chemical plant that killed 17 people in 1990, and the floods and fires that seemed to bring literal hell and high water to the town a year ago -- that have served, people here say with a touch of pride, to make the community all the more tight-knit.
But in some ways, the sense of detachment here made Monday's march of hundreds of thousands of black men seem all the more remote, a bit like watching a lunar landing on television.
Many here said they did not quite "get it" when asked what the rally was all about, and others watched the rally or news accounts of it with suspicion, amusement or total disinterest. Some said they knew absolutely nothing about the rally until asked about it by a reporter.
"I've been working 12-hour shifts," said Mike Meek, an electrician. "I haven't heard a thing about it."

Mrs. Bratton asked. "There are whites, Chinese, Mexicans that are poor." (F. Carter Smith for The New York Times)

The Justice Department extended its campaign against racial discrimination in the banking industry today, reaching a $420,000 settlement with a big Ohio lender accused of charging higher fees to black applicants for mortgages than to white applicants.
The Huntington Mortgage Company, a unit of Huntington Bancshares Inc., agreed to pay the money in response to a Justice Department complaint -- filed along with the settlement today -- that the company had charged higher fees to 117 black applicants in the Cleveland area than to white applicants. The fees consisted mainly of points, which are payments made by mortgage applicants when their loans are approved and which are typically equal to 1 to 3 percentage points of the balance of the mortgage. 
 The Justice Department said today's case was the first in which it had applied fair-lending laws to bank fees on mortgages. Other lending cases since the Clinton Administration began a push to enforce the laws had involved banks that it said were charging higher interest rates to minority borrowers or avoiding doing business in minority neighborhoods.
The company acknowledged that the 117 black applicants had paid more. But it denied any violation of the law, contending that the Justice Department had not looked at a broad enough sample of mortgage applications to demonstrate racial discrimination.
"The Department of Justice's analysis focused on a statistical aberration relating to the Cleveland office of the Huntington Mortgage Company during a limited time period," the company said. "In order to avoid protracted and even more costly litigation, the parties have agreed to resolve this controversy voluntarily."
But Deval L. Patrick, the Assistant Attorney General for civil rights, said the pattern did not occur by chance.
Paul F. Hancock, the chief of the housing section in the Justice Department's civil rights division, said the agency had not found evidence of discrimination in Huntington Mortgage's offices in any area other than Cleveland. The overcharges were said to have occurred from 1991 to 1993, when many banks were still training their staffs on fair-lending laws as the Justice Department began stepping up its enforcement of the 27-year-old legislation.
Bank examiners found no evidence of discrimination during a review of Huntington in 1994, Mr. Hancock said, adding, "When this was brought to their attention, they took some very positive steps."
The $420,000 will be divided among the 117 applicants in proportion to the amounts by which they were said to have been overcharged. The money is "two or three times" greater than the overcharges, a Justice Department official said.
Based in Columbus, Ohio, Huntington Bancshares is the nation's 37th-largest bank as measured by total assets. Its shares fell 56.25 cents today to close at $23.25 in heavy Nasdaq trading.
Lending officers have some discretion in the points they charge on a mortgage, and they generally keep part of this fee, giving them an incentive to charge more. Because the points are not related to the riskiness of the loan, there is no reason for black applicants to be charged more points than white applicants, and banks need to train their lending officers to make sure that this does not happen, Mr. Hancock said.
James D. McLaughlin, the director of Federal agency relations at the American Bankers Association, a trade group based in Washington, said that banks were trying to improve training. But he objected to the Justice Department settlement, saying that there had been no clear rules until now on mortgage points.
"It's a case where there were no clear rules beforehand and now we're getting our wrists slapped afterwards," he said.
Mr. Hancock said that the fair-lending laws clearly barred discrimination on the basis of race or national origin in any lending activity.
The Justice Department also reached a $500,000 settlement today with the Security State Bank of Pecos, a tiny institution in Pecos, Tex., that the department accused of charging higher interest rates to Hispanic applicants for consumer loans. The Federal Reserve Board first noticed a pattern in the interest rates in 1993 and asked the Justice Department to investigate.
Bank officials did not return telephone calls seeking comment.

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
Argentina's fiscal virtue is no match for outside forces.

BYLINE: By Peter Passell 

 BODY:
MEXICO got into big economic trouble last year because the besieged ruling party dared not ask for sacrifice from an electorate that has yet to taste the fruits of growth. Argentina, by contrast, has not budged from the tough policies instituted by a popular democratic Government -- policies that paid off in rapid growth with stable prices from 1990 through 1994.
Yet many forecasters expect Mexico to shake off its economic hangover before Argentina emerges from a recession induced by Mexico's indulgences. And even with the benefit of hindsight, few economists argue that Argentina could have dodged this fate. What's going on here? 
 The short answer is that virtue is not always a guarantee of reward in a global economy driven in part by the self-fulfilling prophecies of footloose investors. The long answer is that Argentina is paying for the sins of generations of past mismanagement. "It's a gamble" for Argentina to hold the line on current policies, argues Rudi Dornbusch, an economist at M.I.T., "but it's a gamble without a realistic alternative."
When the Mexican peso collapsed last December, the shock spread through Latin America as investors rushed to sell local currencies in expectation of other devaluations. Yet Peru and Brazil bounced back quickly, notes Lawrence Krohn, an economist at the Union Bank of Switzerland, while Argentina has foundered. Argentina's widely respected Finance Minister, Domingo Cavallo, has been reduced to presiding over pep rallies for Wall Street, explaining over and over that Argentina will not deviate from the path of economic righteousness. "All he can do is jawbone," Mr. Krohn says.
The explanation lies in Argentina's decadent past. For most of this century, Argentine governments used the ability to create money as just another tool to buy off powerful interests: unions, public employees, the military. As a result, Mr. Dornbusch said, "the economy was essentially dollarized" by the late 1980's: nobody would use the local currency as a store of value or write a contract dependent on its purchasing power.
So in 1991 to prove that Argentina was absolutely, positively going to mend its ways, Mr. Cavallo persuaded his boss, President Carlos Saul Menem, to put monetary policy in a vault and throw away the key. The exchange rate was fixed at one Argentine peso to one American dollar. Much more important, the Government legally committed itself to holding a dollar in the central bank for every peso in currency outstanding and in private bank deposits with the central bank.
As part of a sweeping set of changes that included a conservative fiscal policy, the opening of markets to competition from imports, the weakening of unions and the privatization of most state-owned monopolies, the system has worked. Inflation is down to roughly 3 percent. And with the help of robust foreign investment and a blistering 5 percent rate of productivity change, the economy grew at a rate of almost 8 percent annually from 1990 through 1994.
But this passive monetary policy, known in the jargon of economics as a currency board, has a couple of striking disadvantages when the going gets rough. The most obvious is that Argentina cannot directly expand the money supply to reduce interest rates and stimulate the economy out of recession. Perhaps more important, the Government cannot act as a lender of last resort, providing cash to banks when panicky depositors demand their money back.
Mr. Dornbusch is convinced that "Argentina will be the next Chile," making the leap to modern free-market capitalism in this generation. But that bright future, he says, could be postponed indefinitely if the banking system breaks under the weight of a confidence crisis induced by the current recession. And his caution is reinforced by his own estimate that prices and wages will have to fall considerably before Argentine exports are fully competitive in world markets.
Others are more optimistic. Steve Hanke, an economist at Johns Hopkins University and an adviser to Mr. Cavallo, denies that the Argentine peso is overvalued. He even argues that "the Mexican peso devaluation has been a blessing in disguise" because it hastened the privatization and consolidation of Argentina's inefficient banks. Jose Barrocal, an investment banker with James Wolfensohn & Company in New York, has not spotted that particular silver lining. But he says that "the worst is over," and that the Argentine economy should start growing again in 1996.
Argentina starkly reveals the strengths and weaknesses of the currency board idea. What Mr. Barrocal calls "the clarity and symbolism" of this bulwark against inflation "is already attracting foreign investment that would have gone to Brazil." But the country's current predicament makes it all too clear that the world's smaller economies are now prisoners of forces beyond their reckoning.

HEADLINE: Cuba, Eager for Tourist Dollars, Dusts Off Its Vacancy Sign

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER 

DATELINE: HAVANA

 BODY:
There was a time not too long ago when travelers arriving here from the capitalist world typically were members of solidarity delegations coming to express support for the Cuban Revolution. As they disembarked, they would be greeted by political slogans and posters of Fidel Castro and Che Guevara.
Nowadays, though, the passengers being disgorged from the many flights that land at Jose Marti International Airport are more likely to be Canadian, European or Latin American tourists in search of sun, sand and surf. And while the vacationers wait to clear customs, they are surrounded not by propaganda but by murals touting the diversions that await them: scuba diving, windsurfing, nightclubs. 
 Six years after the collapse of the Soviet bloc forced the Castro Government to re-evaluate its entire economic model, Cuba is once again emerging as a prime tourist spot in the Caribbean. Tourism is now the country's second-largest source of foreign exchange and, propelled by double-digit rates of annual growth, may soon pull even with the slumping sugar industry.
"The steady and sustained development of tourism is something that the Cuban Government regards as being of the utmost importance," said Miguel Brugueras, deputy director of Cuba's National Tourism Institute, the Government body that oversees the industry.
Government officials here report revenue of $850 million from 616,000 foreign visitors in 1994 and anticipate that some 800,000 tourists will spend slightly more than $1 billion this year. By contrast, in 1988, the last full year before the Soviet empire disintegrated, 309,000 people visited Cuba and spent just $189 million.
Before Mr. Castro came to power in 1959, Cuba was the principal tourist destination in the Caribbean, attracting 300,000 visitors a year, 80 percent of them Americans. But that influx was cut off by Washington's 34-year trade embargo against Cuba. For many years the Communist Government derided tourism as corrupt and demeaning, and resumed it only because of the disappearance of the Soviet bloc, which accounted for 85 percent of Cuba's foreign trade.
To accommodate an anticipated increase in visitors, the Cuban Government has embarked on a major hotel construction and renovation drive. The bulk of the construction has been in Varadero, 125 miles east of here. Along miles of glittering amber sands, Spanish, Mexican, French, German other foreign chains now operate hotels catering to European and Canadian travelers.
Cuba is also scheduled to re-enter the cruise business, from which it has been virtually absent for three decades. Under an agreement signed with the Italian company Costa Crociere, a 480-passenger cruise ship, the Costa Playa, will call at Cuban ports beginning in late November.
"In the Caribbean, that's one of the most important sources of income," Mr. Brugueras said, "but this is something that is not up to us. We will truly be able to open to cruise ship passengers only when the United States permits it."
He was alluding to the major hindrance to Cuba's tourism project: the absence of the United States, which would naturally be its largest market. The embargo forbids American citizens to spend money in Cuba and prohibits passenger ships that stop in Cuba from docking in the United States in the same voyage.
But Mr. Brugueras shrugged that off. "American businessmen are losing a magnificent opportunity," he said. "They are going to have to be alert, because this is something that we are not going to abandon."

HEADLINE: HOCKEY;
The Devils' Golden Boy

BYLINE: By ROBERT LIPSYTE 

DATELINE: SECAUCUS, N.J., Oct. 18

 BODY:
The face behind the mask is almost pretty, still soft, without edges, in the very last period of boyhood. A blond curl spills over a broad, unlined, forehead. Pale blue eyes are framed by golden lashes. The full lips are quick to smile above a cleft chin. The voice, enhanced by the sauce of Canadian French, is low but enthusiastic.
"When we play Philadelphia," said Martin Brodeur, the eager collector, "I'll get an autographed stick from Lindros. In 15 years, Eric will be a legend and my kid will be very happy to have the souvenir."
Brodeur's kid, Anthony, is all of 4 months old, but then Brodeur is all of 23 years. He is also the best goalie in the National Hockey League. Tuesday night, in his worst game in recent memory, New Jersey lost, 3-1, to an undeveloped Edmonton team. Brodeur expects the Devils to be hotter Thursday night when they play Detroit in a rematch of their Stanley Cup finals.
"There are nights when you feel so big in the net, you think only a lucky bounce will beat you," he said. "And there are nights you are so small the puck goes right through you.
"I love to be in goal, to be the last line, to be all alone. But being all alone, talking to no one, so intense, you can drain your mental energy. So I try not to think too much, not to invent what will happen before it happens, not to get nervous by thinking, 'If they score now, it's tied, and then they'll score again and beat us.' So, I just go with the game, take what it gives me, and try to give it back."
What may read like cosmic philosophy sounded at lunch today, at a Route 3 restaurant called the Stadium Cafe, like a young man narrating his wonder years. Brodeur, large for a goalie at 6 feet 1 inch, 205 pounds, is comfortable in his skin, relaxed, eager to explain himself. Like most goalies, he dreams of being a forward and scoring; back in Montreal, in street hockey games with the pals he left behind, he always plays forward and tries to beat them with the tricks and shots that N.H.L. forwards use to try to beat him.
He started out as a forward; well into his career, at 7, he was asked to wear the pads of a back-up goalie for a team of 8-year-olds that needed a warm body on the bench. Naturally, the 8-year-old goalie was injured, so the understudy took the stage and has been there ever since. He liked it.
He was the Devils' first draft choice in 1990, and he was rookie of the year in 1993-94, and a key to their championship last season. The Devils won their first four games this season, and Brodeur gave up only five goals. But during warm-ups Tuesday night he sensed the streak might be over. The Devils were not up. Byrne Meadowlands Arena, whose wide angles dissipate the roar of the crowd, was only half-filled. Many of the Edmonton players were youngsters unknown to the Devils, but they knew every Devil on the team to beat.
Twelve hours later, over a turkey sandwich and coffee, Brodeur had already shrugged the loss away. He is known for his lack of emotion on the ice, his even temper, his consistent steadiness; he is thought to be unusually mature for his age. He thinks he is merely economical with his energy. During commercial timeouts, he skates in circles, winks at friends in the crowd and makes an effort to empty his mind of the game. He takes deep breaths, a technique taught by the Devils' goalie coach, Jacques Caron.
"There are goalies more spectacular than me," he said, "but I don't think I'd be better if I put mustard on my saves. I'm too big to sprawl around. And I have such good teammates. They take care of the passer and I take care of the shooter."
Once, in a wildly atypical move during the Eastern Conference finals against Philadelphia last year, Brodeur attacked a player who had just knocked him down. Stretched out on the ice, Brodeur slashed at the knees of Gilbert Dionne, then got up and jumped on him. Both men received two-minute penalties. Brodeur still regrets his response.
"It was selfish," he said. "It could have been costly to the team."
"You could have hurt the guy."
He shrugged. "That's the game."
"But you showed you were tough," a companion suggested. "You wouldn't take it."
"I don't need that reputation," he said. "Guys will bug you, talk trash, try to get you to snap again. Of course," the lips widened, "I can't guarantee it won't happen again."
Brodeur was bred for this. The youngest of five children, he followed two older brothers into sports, one of whom pitched in the Expos' farm system. His father, now a well-known sports photographer in Canada, was a minor league and Olympic goalie. Growing up in Montreal, he worshiped hockey in its holiest city. When the Devils played there last Saturday night, the crowd at the Forum gave him an ovation and the captain of the Canadiens, Mike Keane, asked him for an autographed stick.
Life in New Jersey has been low-key and sweet. He says he enjoys going unrecognized at movies and malls and during trips to the city with his wife, Melanie, a hometown sweetheart: "I get the fun of fame, and the loss of privacy, during the summer in Montreal."
It seemed as though he might not make it back to New Jersey for his third season. Drastically underpaid his first two years, at about $140,000 per, he held out this season for twice what he eventually settled for, an announced $5.3 million over three years. Compared with what other goalies are getting, that was considered a management coup.
"Money is an issue because you never know how long you'll play," he said. "But once you're paid over a million, there's no shame. At 23, that's a lot of money. I was stuck business-wise because they know that all I want to do is play hockey. We'll see what happens when the contract is up. I'll be 26. Until then, I'm sure I'll be able to put some peanut butter on my toast."
