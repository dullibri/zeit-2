HEADLINE: Furor in Seoul Over North's Atom Plant

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, April 15

 BODY:
South Korea's Defense Minister said last week that his country might be forced to mount a commando raid against a nuclear installation near Pyongyang that experts believe could produce crude atomic weapons within five years. In response, North Korea accused the South today of issuing "virtually a declaration of war."
The South Korean Defense Minister, Lee Jong Koo, made his comments about the installation on Friday at a meeting with Korean editors, but retracted them that evening after they were reported by the South Korean press. It was the first time that any South Korean official had publicly suggested that a pre-emptive strike might be the best way to prevent North Korea from making nuclear weapons. 
 North Korea's leader, Kim Il Sung, has repeatedly denied that the nuclear installation is designed to produce weapons. But he has said he will not let inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency visit the plant until the United States removes all nuclear weapons from the South. The United States maintains more than 40,000 troops in South Korea, and they are believed to be equipped with nuclear weapons.
 
Concern in Asia
 The nuclear plant at Yongbyon, 60 miles from the North Korean capital and about 100 miles from the demilitarized zone, has become the focus of increasing concern throughout Asia.Japan has said that it will not provide badly needed economic aid to the North until it accedes to international inspection of its nuclear sites.
Japanese and American experts say the plutonium output of the plant should be big enough by the mid-1990's to to produce a half-dozen simple nuclear devices a year. North Korea already has advanced Scud missiles, and officials in Seoul fear they could be fitted with nuclear warheads.
Roh Tae Woo, South Korea's President, is expected to raise the issue of the North's weapons potential on Friday, when he meets with President Mikhail S. Gorbachev for the first visit of a Soviet leader to South Korea. He is scheduled to stop on Cheju, a resort island off the southern tip of South Korea.
In Tokyo today, Vladlen A. Martynov, a senior official of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, told reporters that the "Soviet Union has warned North Korea that if it does not let in the international inspectors, the Soviet Union will stop all kinds of supplies regarding this facility." It is unclear how much that would hurt the North Koreans, since they already have the basic technology for the plant, and the North mines its own natural uranium.
In the meeting with the Korea Newspaper Editors Association, Mr. Lee said that by the end of 1995 the North would be making nuclear weapons. Some participants said that he then discussed the idea of an "Entebbe-style" raid, a reference to the 1976 Israeli raid in Uganda to free passengers on a hijacked airliner.
Immediately after Mr. Lee made the comments, the Government ordered Yonhap, the news agency that it partially controls, to withdraw its dispatch on the comments.

HEADLINE: In New York, the Trip Is Not Quite as Bumpy

BYLINE: By CALVIN SIMS

 BODY:
Despite declining ridership, swelling budget deficits and a potential decline in Federal and state financing, New Yorkers have no reason to fear drastic cuts or elimination of service like those being considered in Philadelphia, New York transit officials said.
But the officials said that the effects of the region's weak economy, including a recent drop in tax revenue, and proposals to decrease government subsidies would lead to fare increases and reductions in service on bus and subway lines where ridership is relatively light. 
 They said the cuts could be taken before the end of the year.
"We are facing some very tough problems, but shutting down the subways and buses is just not an option for us here in New York," said Peter E. Stangl, chairman of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which oversees the agencies that operate the city's subways, buses and railroads. "Mass transit is critical to the New York region, and without it we could not function."
 
3.5 Million People a Day
 New York City depends more than any other city on mass transit. One of every three people who take mass transit in the United States does so in New York City. Every day, its subways carry 3.5 million people over 700 miles of track in 6,232 cars and its buses carry 1.5 million passengers.
Mr. Stangl said the New York City Transit Authority would have a deficit of about $215 million in its operating budget for 1991. He said the Long Island Rail Road and Metro-North Commuter Railroad would have deficits of $22 million and $17 million, respectively.
Half of the agency's $2.9 billion-a-year operating budget comes from fare revenue; the other half comes from government subsidies, including 6 percent from the Federal Government, 13.9 percent from the state, 13.9 percent from the city, 55.6 percent from taxes on real estate, telephone service and corporate profits and 10.5 percent from surpluses in the operating budgets of certain toll bridges and tunnels.
In the past, Mr. Stangl said, Gov. Mario M. Cuomo and the State Legislature supported the authority, allocating billions of dollars for operating expenses and major improvements . But Mr. Stangl and other transit officials said the region stood to lose millions of dollars in government financing for its mass transit system in the 1992 fiscal year.
The Bush Administration has proposed eliminating Federal subsidies for cities with more than one million residents, and Governor Cuomo has proposed to reduce the state's assistance.

For Beene, Finis Means Let Us Begin

BYLINE: By BERNADINE MORRIS

 BODY:
With a distinguished collection of innovative clothes, Geoffrey Beene brought six weeks of fall fashion shows to a brilliant conclusion on Friday. The showings, which had begun in March in a lugubrious mood in Milan, Italy, as economic clouds darkened all over the world, had a happy ending.
The gloom that persisted through the London openings lifted finally in Paris with clothes that were upbeat and imaginative by Karl Lagerfeld, for himself and for Chanel, and by Claude Montana, Christian Lacroix, Emanuel Ungaro and Yves Saint Laurent. 
 The surprise of the Paris openings was the acceptance of Oscar de la Renta, the first American to show a collection on the same scale as the French. Mr. de la Renta acquired some European retail accounts and considerable exposure in the world press.
But perhaps his most important achievement was the recognition that American designers are no longer provincial or limited to sportswear. His emphasis on plaids was ranked with the ethnic themes ricocheting through the designs of the world's most prestigious designers. It is widely called the Highland fling.
In New York, Christian Francis Roth's painstaking reproductions of Amish quilt patterns and Isaac Mizrahi's evocation of American Indian culture with his beaded leathers and fringe were among the most provocative of the cross-cultural fashion moves.
But it was not necessary to be ethnically oriented to create a stir. Calvin Klein did so quietly with simple clothes like jacket dresses and tunics that focused, like most designers' work, on legs. Not bare legs; they were almost always covered with thick tights or clinging stretch pants. Donna Karan was somewhat more blatant with her snugly wrapped skirts and stretch dresses. And Ralph Lauren's clothes were serene and sophisticated.
Those three, who are associated with sportswear, the all-American field of design, have moved beyond casual clothes. While the elements of sportswear are still part of their work, they have gone far afield with clothes suitable for work, party-going and travel. In the top echelons of fashion, sportswear has pretty much ceased to exist.
The issue of longer skirts, which loomed large in March, had pretty much dissipated by the end of the showings. Again, it was the Americans who put the question to rest. If an American designer had found an impressive new way to make longer skirts palatable, or if enough people had pursued the issue, the results might have been different. But a vast majority of skirts cleared the knees, some considerably.
Long styles occasionally made an appearance. While some were attractive, notably Mr. Mizrahi's full skirts and Mr. Roth's Amish-inspired styles, they weren't enough to tilt the balance. Short remains the norm, although some designers, like Mr. Klein, said they had lengthened their hems -- a whole inch.
The one area where long clothes have made an impact is in coats. Whether they are big wrappy styles like Mr. Klein's or supple narrow columns like Mr. Beene's, the long coats make sense for cold weather over midthigh-length skirts and dresses.
In the end, it was Mr. Beene's rhapsodic approach to dressmaking that left the most lasting impression. With hardly a straight seam, the clothes curved around the body, sometimes opening unpredictably to show an arc of skin. Though they were mostly narrow, there was no sense of stress as the models passed swiftly across the stage, no inhibition of movement.
Each style was an exploration of the possibilities of fabric and cut, and a result was a collection that owed no homage to any other designer. Mr. Beene believes his voyage of discovery has just begun.
Such innovation is rare indeed. It may ultimately have as great an impact on fashion as Madeleine Vionnet's discovery of the bias cut in the 1930's or Gabrielle Chanel's investigation of the possibilities of black jersey as a fashion fabric in the 1920's.
It can only increase New York's prestige as a fashion center to have a designer in such control of his craft at work in the city. That his audience was aware of his accomplishment was evident by the ovation Mr. Beene received after the last model appeared in a long, gently draped black column with her head swathed in filmy lace. While there had been plenty of applause and some "bravos" at earlier showings, this was the only standing ovation. It was an appropriate ending to the season's shows.

HEADLINE: THE DOCTOR'S WORLD;
Debate Flares Over IUD Challenge

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE K. ALTMAN, M.D.

 BODY:
A NEW challenge to the validity of research that led to the removal of the Dalkon Shield and other intrauterine devices from the United States market has raised serious questions about the factors that influence the birth-control choices made available to Americans.
An unfortunate result of the Dalkon Shield story has been a narrowed choice of contraception for American women and a decline in the research to develop new devices and alternative methods of family planning. 
 A report last year from the National Research Council and the Institute of Medicine in Washington stressed the need for new contraceptive methods because those on the market are not well suited to the religious, social, economic or health circumstances of many Americans.
Further, because women remain fertile for 35 years and men longer, contraceptive methods appropriate at one stage of life may not be at another. Nursing mothers, teen-agers and older women may have differing contraception needs and many women cannot use some contraceptive methods like the birth control pill because they have high blood pressure or diabetes, or they smoke. New contraceptives for men are also a goal.
But the United States legal system has slowed the development and marketing of new contraceptives, the report said. Loss of consumer acceptance of IUD's has led many manufacturers to abandon research in contraceptives.
"Without changes in the product liability rules and procedures, it appears likely that even fewer firms will allocate even fewer resources to contraceptive research and development," the report said.
Perhaps the biggest price of the IUD litigation is the number of unintended pregnancies, which also carry risks of illness and death. By one estimate, the lack of IUD's will lead 160,000 American women to have unintended pregnancies each year. More than half will elect to have an abortion. The remainder may give birth to unwanted children.
The report urged that liability for contraceptive products be preserved. But it urged Congress to pass legislation that recognized the importance of the careful review the Food and Drug Administration performs before it licenses a drug or device. In effect, the National Research Council said, the F.D.A.'s review process was a quality control mechanism that should protect the manufacturer.
Nevertheless, experts have faulted as inadequate the F.D.A.'s surveillance system, which is aimed at detecting problems after a contraceptive product is marketed. The system needs to be improved to provide systematic and timely feedback about the benefits and hazards of contraceptive products.
The F.D.A.'s authority over the marketing of devices has changed from 1971, when the Dalkon Shield was introduced, based on research data that were so skimpy and flawed that it is highly unlikely that it would lead to approval today.
Although many experts believe the Dalkon Shield was faulty in its design, they say the defect in one device does not necessarily apply to other IUD's.
Shortly after the Dalkon Shield was introduced, doctors began reporting life-threatening infections among users. Experts did not know whether the device caused the infections or whether the women had independently developed sexually transmitted infections.
Beginning in 1976, Federal health officials sponsored the Women's Health Study to evaluate the risks of pelvic infection developing among women who used IUD's.
Lawyers for women who contended they had been harmed by the Dalkon Shield said data from the studies played a central role in the litigation against the device's manufacturer, A.H. Robins of Richmond.
Douglas E. Bragg, a lawyer in Denver who has represented more than a dozen plaintiffs, said the studies were among the most important evidence in the litigation because they were Government sponsored, involved several medical centers and were considered carefully designed.
Although the studies "certainly were a strong piece of evidence in support of our cases," Mr. Bragg said, he won two cases before they were completed.
Now a team headed by Dr. Richard A. Kronmal, a biostatistician at the University of Washington in Seattle, has raised serious questions about the methodology used in the Women's Health Study, which found a 60 percent increased risk of pelvic infection among IUD users. Two of the three authors of the study, Dr. Kronmal and Dr. Stephen Mumford, were consultants to A.H. Robins.
The Dalkon Shield problem led to the removal of other IUD's from the market, even though the F.D.A. did not raise questions about their safety and very few successful lawsuits had been brought against manufacturers other than A.H. Robins.
"It was never a medical decision to withdraw the devices," said Dr. Sheldon Segal of the Population Council in New York City, a leading expert in contraception. "It was a corporate decision based on a view of expense."
At a recent meeting in Finland, Dr. Segal said he was struck by seeing displays of more than a dozen different types of IUD's that were marketed outside the United States. But only two IUD's are now approved for use in the United States.
Many American doctors are surprised at the extent of use of IUD's in other countries. Dr. Harold Kaminetzky, an official of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists in Washington, attributed that in part to the provincialism of American medicine. Most American doctors do not read foreign journals and therefore pay little attention to trends and practices that are reported elsewhere.
Dr. Kronmal's analysis was unusual because, unlike many other critiques, he went back to the raw data from the Women's Health Study to do the analysis, which appears in the current issue of The Journal of Clinical Epidemiology.
"Writing critiques is not something that makes you very popular because people tend to think of you as a gadfly," Dr. Kronmal said. Also, he said, "it is hard to get published."
But he said it was crucial that any studies that could have such dire consequences as those involving IUD's be based on sound methods and subject to repeated scrutiny.
 Although Federal health officials have check lists for approving claims of benefit for new drugs and devices, they have no similar formal evaluation of putative hazards, said Dr. Alvan R. Feinstein of Yale Medical School, who is the editor of The Journal of Clinical Epidemiology.
He criticized what he called "hit and run epidemiology." "Epidemiologists attack a product as a menace, it is removed from the market, or some other action is taken, and that is the end of it," Dr. Feinstein said.

HEADLINE: A Multiracial Council District Best Reflects Lower East Side

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Lower East Siders for a Multiracial District, of which we are coordinators, believes ours is the only proposal for a New York City Council district for the Lower East Side that adheres to the City Charter mandate to "keep intact neighborhoods and communities with established ties to common interest and association, whether historical, racial, economic, ethnic, religious or other."
We support mapping to maximize minority representation and do not regard this as gerrymandering in reverse. On the Lower East Side, no single minority has the population needed to create a Latino, Asian or African-American council district. But by combining their numbers, we achieve lines within which lives an 83 percent minority population. From that district a minority candidate has the best opportunity to be elected. (Most people working on districting around the city believe a minimum of 75 percent minority population is necessary to assure the election of a minority candidate.) 
 Furthermore, such a united district on the Lower East Side keeps together people with shared economic and other interests, including better schools with responsive bilingual education, quality health care and affordable housing for low and middle-income families.
Our united district stretches from the Brooklyn Bridge north to 14th Street and includes the most eastern census tracts of the area, as well as Chinatown. Thus we include the neighborhoods in which people of many ethnic and economic groups have lived and worked together, and to which immigrants from all parts of the world continue to come to find refuge and opportunity. This resembles one of the proposals presented by the Redistricting Commission (news article, April 11).
While creating an Asian district is an admirable goal, an analysis of the 1990 census data shows this is not possible. The district that will best serve the political interests of the Asian community brings it together with others having similar concerns. Combining parts of Chinatown with areas to its west, as several Redistricting Commission proposals would do, creates a district with a majority of higher-income nonminority voters, whose numbers will increase over the next 10 years as such housing as Battery Park City is occupied.
In addition, such a district would dilute the impact of the Latino vote by splitting it with a district boundary cutting east-west through the heart of the Lower East Side.
While pride in culture and race are important, winning the bread-and-butter issues depends on electing a candidate who can be held accountable to the majority. In 1991, that majority on the Lower East Side consists of low- and middle-income people: Latinos, Asians and African-Americans.

HEADLINE: Caller Beware if Bell Companies Are Let Loose;
Anticompetitive Bill

 BODY:
 To the Editor:
"A Justified Ban on 'Baby Bells' " (editorial, March 30) is on target in saying that Senator Ernest Hollings's proposal to lift the manufacturing ban on regional Bell companies "offers few potential benefits, and substantial potential abuse."
The American telecommunications industry is strong and growing. It is delivering consumer choice, innovation and dramatically lower prices. 
 The Bell companies argue that the restrictions that prevent them from manufacturing damage United States competitiveness. Sam Ginn ("Lift the Ban on 'Baby Bells,' " Op-Ed, March 28) cites the manufacturing restriction as the reason for anemic investment in research and development and a balance-of-trade problem. The facts suggest otherwise.
We face a chronic deficit in consumer telecommunications products (telephone sets, answering machines, for example), which the Hollings bill does not remedy. Yet the total telecommunications trade deficit has fallen 70 percent in two years. Exports increased at an average annual rate of 29 percent in 1989 and 1990, while imports leveled off. We have a trade surplus in network equipment. A.T.&T. alone exported more than $1 billion of equipment from its United States facilities in 1990.
Our excellent trade results show United States products to be fully competitive against foreign products, and United States investment in telecommunications research and development more than adequate.
The lower level of research and development investment of the Bell companies is consistent with their business. They are service companies, not manufacturers. If they become manufacturers while retaining their monopolies, the Bell company marketplace could become closed to fair competition. A.T.&T. and other United States companies would thus lose any business incentive to continue making heavy research and development commitments. The result would be less, not more, American investment. The Hollings bill should be defeated.

HEADLINE: Philadelphia Transit System Nearly Out of Money

BYLINE: By MICHAEL deCOURCY HINDS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PHILADELPHIA, April 15

 BODY:
Intensifying their pleas for help, officials here say the nation's fourth largest mass transit system is about to run out of money.
The Federal and state governments are planning substantial reductions in aid to mass transit, and if both go through with the cuts, the transit system here will have no way to pay its daily expenses. Officials say the system will also fall hopelessly behind in repairing hundreds of failing bridges, miles of rusting elevated steel structures and corroding concrete tunnels. 
 "We're not crying wolf -- a total shutdown is a real possibility," said Louis J. Gambaccini, chief operations officer and general manager of the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority, or Septa, as the system of street cars, buses and trains is known.
Federal and state officials are still negotiating their budgets for the next fiscal year, and Mr. Gambaccini said he was hoping that the warning would be extreme enough to avoid cuts in financing and avert a shutdown.
 
Highest Fare in Nation
 Septa officials believe they cannot turn elsewhere for the needed money. The system, which carries 600,000 people a day, has reduced service, closed 30 of its 250 miles of rail lines and, just last year, raised its base fare to $1.50, the highest in the nation. And it has promised riders that it will not raise the fare again until service is improved.
Just as Philadelphia, with its financial crisis still-unresolved, led most of the nation's cities into an era of deepening financial difficulties, Septa is providing a bleak glimpse of what the future might hold for some of their mass transit systems.
"Philadelphia's transit system is the leading locomotive, heading down the tracks into mass transit bankruptcy, and right behind it are just about every other mass transit system in the country," said George Sternlieb, an urban specialist who is professor emeritus of public policy at Rutgers University. Transit operators around the nation offer less dire forecasts, but nearly all of them see flashing yellow lights ahead.
Most transit systems face declining public subsidies, hastened by the recession, as well as increasing costs for repairing or replacing everything from bridges to buses to, in Septa's case, 1920's-era crank telephones and wooden drainpipes. In recent years, the nation's transit operators have been investing only $3.6 billion annually, on average, for major improvements, or about one-half to one-quarter of the investment needed to keep their systems in good condition.
"We're talking about a chronic problem that is just getting worse and worse each year," said Jack R. Gilstrap, executive vice president of the American Public Transit Association, a trade group in Washington. "The point at which the chronic problem becomes acute, you have a Philadelphia."
Federal support for mass transit has declined by half in the last decade, as first the Reagan Administration and then the Bush Administration shifted more responsibility to the states and local governments.
The Administration now wants to eliminate the operating subsidies for large transit systems, which carry nearly all of the nation's riders. It is proposing to spend $16.6 billion for mass transit over the next five years. When compared with current spending, and adjusted for inflation, that works out to a 2 percent decrease in the 1992 fiscal year and a projected 20 percent decrease by the 1996 fiscal year.
The Federal subsidy currently averages about 5 percent of a system's operating budget. Some systems, including Houston, spend all or nearly all of their Federal subsidies on new equipment and major repairs.
As part of its proposal, the Administration wants to reduce Federal participation in major improvements by requiring local governments to increase their share of a project's cost, to 40 percent from 20 percent. But transit officials say they will have a hard time finding the extra money.
Transportation specialists expect Congress to restore some money to mass transit, but not enough to reverse the trend of declining Federal aid.
Transportation Secretary Samuel K. Skinner, a former chairman of Chicago's Regional Transit Authority, said recently that the Administration's plan would be viewed as a setback. But he said transit systems would just have to run more efficiently with more local support. "Transit systems probably should cut back service," he said. "Most places run service where it's a luxury rather than a necessity."
 
Dependence on Tax Revenue
 Transit officials disagree and say their budgets have already been squeezed by declining state and local support. In addition, most transit systems depend on tax revenue dedicated to mass transit, and the recession has deeply cut into those funds. And raising fares means losing riders.
"We're looking at serious problems," said William A. Utter, a spokesman for Chicago's transit agency. "We'd need a fare increase of up to 20 percent and we'd be shutting down service late at night and closing certain rapid train stations and bus routes."
Miami's Metro-Dade Transit Agency has already raised fares twice in the last nine months and cut 500,000 miles from the routes its buses and trains travel. Proposed county and Federal reductions next year would require cutting almost 3 million more miles of transit routes, or about 10 percent of service. "We're talking about cutting routes that have good ridership," said Chester E. Colby, the agency's director.
But cutting service is not always politically possible, and that reality can send a transit system into a death spiral, Mr. Colby said. "If we can't cut service and have to defer maintenance, we could end up like Septa, and we wouldn't be alone."
Transportation policy analysts in Washington also criticized the Bush Administration's approach to mass transit, but for different reasons.
 
Arguing for Rider Support
 For instance, William G. Laffer 3d, a policy analyst at the Heritage Foundation, said the people who benefit from roads and subways should pay their full cost, not the Federal Government. Although that would not mean more money for mass transit, said Mr. Laffer, it would indirectly help mass transit because the higher cost of driving would encourage people to use buses and trains.
Clifford Winston, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, is less sure about eliminating Federal aid, but he maintains that mass transit will survive only if it can compete with other forms of transportation. "We can't make a determination whether the Federal Government should be subsidizing one form of transportation or another until we know how efficiently each system operates," Mr. Winston said. "The Administration proposal lacks any vision or coherence."
In Philadelphia, Septa officials say the uncertain timing of the budget bills in Washington and in Harrisburg means they cannot say when they would make a decision on closing the system. But for legal and political reasons, they say, they would probably close the whole system, rather than shutting down some routes and keeping others open.
The timing, moreover, could not be worse for Septa because the State Legislature, which has ignored its pleas in the past, is already struggling to close a budget gap of almost $3 billion for this fiscal year and the next.
Septa could lose $37 million in state aid for its operating expenses and major improvement projects in the next fiscal year, starting July 1. It could also lose at least $28 million more in Federal aid. In addition, Philadelphia, which subsidizes the system, is already $10 million behind in its payments.
"If the state and Federal proposals go forward, we will almost certainly have to close down," said Mr. Gambaccini, who was assistant executive director of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey before coming here in 1988.
Septa officials say that unless they are assured of receiving $450 million a year for new equipment and major improvements -- about $300 million a year more than it receives now -- a significant portion of the rail system will deteriorate beyond repair within five years. Septa is one of a handful of major systems that do not have a tax whose revenues are dedicated to its needs.
 
'A Catastrophic Future'
 "Without the dedicated tax for capital improvements, there is no future for Septa," said J. Clayton Undercofler, chairman of Septa's board. "It is a catastrophic future, but I don't know when the catastrophe begins."
Septa has always been synonymous with problems. The Legislature created Septa in 1964 as a regional transit system to coordinate and operate a handful of systems, including bus, trolley, trackless trolley, subway, elevated and high-speed commuter train routes, in Philadelphia and the surrounding counties of Bucks, Chester, Delaware and Montgomery. The systems were once privately owned and were badly maintained. In 1983 Septa took over battered and largely obsolete commuter lines from the quasi-public Conrail. It now operates 2,500 vehicles over 3,500 miles of roads, tracks and trolley lines. The pace of deterioration has always exceeded Septa's limited budget for repairs.
Some say Septa is operating a safety hazard, not a transit system. "Their own engineers have serious concerns about the safety of the system," said Harry Lombardo, president of the Transport Workers Union, the largest transit union here, with 5,600 members. Mr. Lombardo, who advocates closing the system to force a political solution, cited internal Septa memorandums describing safety concerns.
Mr. Lombardo provided several memorandums, including one written in January by a senior engineer. It stated that transit workers were not able to "maintain Septa's structural systems in a reliable state" and that a major failure could possibly result in the collapse of station platforms and elevated tracks on the Market-Frankford Elevated Subway line, the system's busiest route in the city.
Mr. Gambaccini is no apologist for the system. "We're walking a tightrope," he said. "We feel the system is safe, but it is rapidly worsening."

HEADLINE: Caller Beware if Bell Companies Are Let Loose;
Unfair Restrictions

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"A Justified Ban on 'Baby Bells' " (editorial, March 30), protesting Senator Ernest Hollings's bill to remove manufacturing restrictions on the seven regional Bell operating companies, does not fully address the impact of this legislation on small and medium-sized manufacturers.
The restrictions are not limited to manufacturing by regional Bells; they also preclude vital investments in land ventures with small and medium-sized American manufacturing companies. But the restrictions leave the regional Bells free to pursue both activities with overseas companies. 
 The rapidly growing telecommunications business is very cash-intensive, and critical research and development investments must be made constantly. Although you suggest there are "hundreds of U.S. equipment manufacturers in a vibrant industry," the opportunities for knowledgeable telecommunications investment have shriveled.
United States venture capital investment is in decline. Only one large telecommunications company in this country, Motorola, has demonstrated an appetite for investment, and the other, American Telephone & Telegraph, is focusing on downsizing and entering the computer business.
The practical alternative for growth financing for many American manufacturers today is foreign investment. At Centigram Communications Corporation, our experience with investors from Canada and Singapore has been excellent. However, additional investment by our major customers (the regional Bells) could increase opportunities for companies like ours to grow.
As president and chief executive officer of a small United States manufacturing company, I believe American telecommunications policy is at a critical juncture. These restrictions unfairly limit American companies.
It is time to repeal the manufacturing prohibition on the regional Bells by supporting the Hollings bill. Otherwise, economic reality will cause United States telecommunications policy to be set outside the United States.

Executive at Citicorp To Help Lead Quotron

BYLINE: By ISADORE BARMASH

 BODY:
Thomas J. Cirillo has been named president and chief operating officer of Quotron, a provider of stock and foreign-exchange trading information owned by Citicorp. Mr. Cirillo, who joined Citicorp in 1979, was most recently division executive in charge of much of Citicorp's leasing activities in the United States.
The 42-year-old Mr. Cirillo will succeed Paul F. Glaser, who is retiring on May 1 at age 65. He will report to the subsidiary's chairman and chief executive, Leland H. Amaya. 
 Quotron has not made a profit since it was acquired by Citicorp five years ago, and in 1990, it had a loss exceeding $200 million. In February, according to the American Banker, a trade newspaper, Quotron signed a contract renewal with its largest customer, Paine Webber, but at a substantial price concession that could cause Quotron to lose money on the deal. Executives at Citicorp declined to comment on Quotron's financial problems.
In a telephone interview, Mr. Cirillo said Quotron planned to develop a new data center, data network and support system that would "improve customer delivery and our service to the customer." He added, "When it is completed several years from now, the new infrastructure will give our customers better tools to work with."
He said Quotron's ability to serve its customers "is constrained by our technology, adding, "that's why we are undertaking this new project."
The project, still in the planning stages, will be carried on in New York, Los Angeles and other cities, he said.
Asked if Quotron was suffering in part because of the Wall Street consolidations, Mr. Cirillo replied: "The overall economic effect has hurt, and we would like a better Wall Street climate. But, while we have to await the new infrastructure, we will continue to make improvements by broadening our product and improving our service."
Mr. Cirillo is a native New Yorker. He attended the Massachusetts Institute of Technology but did not complete his undergraduate studies. After leaving M.I.T., he spent 10 years in the systems industry as a consultant on software before joining Citicorp.
Currently, Quotron has about 85,000 terminals operating at financial companies, down from about 100,000 in 1989. As the financial community continues to consolidate, Quotron expects the number of terminals to drop to about 80,000 by year-end.

HEADLINE: Market Place;
Consumer Trends Bothering P.&G.

BYLINE: By Anthony Ramirez

 BODY:
WHEN the Procter & Gamble Company bought Max Factor and other cosmetics lines from Revlon Inc. for $1.14 billion last week, it won general praise on Wall Street. Now comes the hard part.
Later this month, Procter & Gamble will report how severely the recession has punished the 97 percent of its business that is not cosmetics. 
 In recent months, securities analysts have been steadily whittling their forecasts for P.&G.'s third-quarter earnings, from about $1.29 a share to about $1.20 or less. That compares with $1.14 a share in the 1990 quarter. Modest or flat unit sales growth in the United States, where P.&G. does more than 60 percent of its business, is to blame for the weak expectations, analysts say.
Despite the soft short-term outlook, many analysts think Procter & Gamble has strong growth possibilities, especially in its stock price. Yesterday on the New York Stock Exchange, P.&G. gained $1.875 a share to close at $89.375, almost 18 times estimated 1991 earnings. Jay H. Freedman, a consumer-products analyst at Kidder, Peabody, thinks that the share price could reach $110 in the next year and a half.
Getting there may be a bumpy road, however. Although many consumer-products companies are perceived by investors as safe harbors in a recession, they are nonetheless harmed when increasing numbers of consumers lose their jobs, or even when those still employed begin to cut back spending. Analysts say that an internal P.&G. survey found that 18 out of 24 markets that the company serves -- including detergents and toothpaste -- are showing soft or declining unit sales.
Added to that is the fact that population growth in the United States has been only 1 percent or so a year. So, the supply of consumers with money in their pockets is growing slowly even without a recession. In addition, supermarkets and mass merchandisers have built too many stores, adding to the pressure to stock less.
Procter & Gamble is especially vulnerable when people curtail spending because the typical American home offers a cavalcade of the Cincinnati giant's products. Wake up in the morning and you can wash with Ivory soap, shampoo with Pert Plus and brush your teeth with Crest. Don't forget the Secret deodorant. Still groggy? Have some Folgers coffee. Before you leave the house, be sure to load the dishwasher with Cascade detergent and the washing machine with Tide laundry detergent.
But even such a roster of strong brands cannot entirely offset some apparent trends in the marketplace. Analysts say that retailers, despite already lean inventories, are continuing to cut back, a development affecting many packaged-goods companies. Bonita Austin, an analyst at Wertheim Schroder, said the Colgate-Palmolive Company reported that some of its supermarket accounts were maintaining inventories of 1.5 weeks on some products, compared with 3 weeks, only a few months ago. "Even three weeks isn't a whole lot," Ms. Austin said.
Inventories may be thinning because money-conscious consumers are stocking up less, buying one bottle of shampoo instead of two, for instance.
Moreover, there is scattered evidence that consumers, either newly jobless or simply cautious, are increasingly "trading down" to cheaper generic or store brands for detergents, toilet paper, toothpaste and other consumer goods. The strength of the trend isn't clear yet, however. Ms. Austin notes that Helene Curtis Industries is reporting booming sales of its budget Suave shampoo, but is also seeing strong sales of its higher-priced Salon Selective.
The hazards of recession have focused Procter & Gamble's attention on acquiring health and beauty lines. In recent years, it bought such brand products as Nyquil cold remedy, Oil of Olay moisturizing cream and Cover Girl cosmetics, and last week, it made the Max Factor deal.
Health and beauty products have above-average growth possibilities in unit sales, perhaps 3 percent to 5 percent annually, because the population is aging and older consumers are more likely to buy products like P.&G.'s Pepto-Bismol. A growth rate of 2 percent or so is expected for P.&G.'s more basic products, like laundry detergent.
Profits, too, can be above average in health and beauty products, another attraction for P.&G. Alice Beebe Longley, an analyst with Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette, said a successful fragrance could have a profit margin as high as 40 percent, compared with 10 percent or 11 percent for detergents.
Not all analysts, of course, are excited about Procter & Gamble's Max Factor deal, which at least doubled, to about $1.6 billion, the company's revenues from cosmetics and fragrance lines. Mary Ann Winter, an analyst at Brown Brothers Harriman, noted that those revenues would still be only a small part of Procter & Gamble's total, which was $24 billion in the 1990 fiscal year.
Ms. Winter, who has been neutral on P.&G. since the start of the recession and the onset of the Persian Gulf crisis, said: "I'm not excited about the deal. I'm not against the deal. I'd like to see how the company as a whole performs in the next few months."

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
Parental Leave: Symbols Matter

BYLINE: By Peter Passell

 BODY:
IT'S no mystery why the Democratic leadership is pushing hard for passage of the Family and Medical Leave Act. The bill, which would require employers to give workers 12 weeks of unpaid leave to care for newborns or seriously ill family members, is strongly supported by the Democrats' allies in organized labor and women's groups. And it apparently ranks up there in popularity with three-day weekends and hot fudge sundaes: A Louis Harris poll last June found that 74 percent of Americans favored the measure.
The real surprise is that President Bush, the pragmatist's pragmatist, vetoed similar legislation in 1990 and shows no signs of relenting this time around. While any Government-mandated benefit treads on ground sacred to free-marketeers, this one would barely leave a footprint: Two federally commissioned studies suggest employers' costs would run to pennies a week per worker. 
 The President's stand is all the more remarkable in light of whom it is likely to offend. Middle-class working women, the group with the most to gain from the right to unpaid leave, may represent the swing vote in the suburbs.
One plausible explanation for White House intransigence is the fear of a far more expensive mandated benefit, medical insurance. But some analysts take Mr. Bush's veto message at face value: The President, they believe, really does mean to stand on principle -- albeit one that has mostly been honored in the breach.
The bill being shepherded through Congress by Representative Patricia Schroeder of Colorado and Senator Christopher J. Dodd of Connecticut would mandate leaves up to three months. Businesses with fewer than 50 on the payroll would be exempt. Leave time would be unpaid; accumulating benefits -- for example, pensions tied to years of service -- would be put on hold. The only direct cost to employers would be any health insurance that went with the job.
Most other industrial economies demand far more generous leave benefits, including some minimum weekly cash payment. And a dozen American states already mandate leave under some circumstances. Typically, the state laws demand only that which is freely given: A 1988 survey by the Small Business Administration shows that large corporations usually accommodate employees with babies or sick family members.
The General Accounting Office says this legislation "would not cause major disruptions." Employers bother to replace temporarily absent workers only one-third of the time. And when they do, the substitutes rarely cost as much as the wages saved. The G.A.O. reckons that the net cost of the mandated benefit would thus amount to the cost of continuing health coverage -- $330 million if 5 percent of eligible workers took leaves each year.
Eileen Trzcinski and William Alpert, economists at Cornell and the University of Connecticut, respectively, offer a more cautious assessment. Their analysis for the Small Business Administration estimates that leaves would cost large employers about $90 a week in net producitivity loss, plus $35 in insurance coverage. Thus if an extra two million workers took six extra weeks of leave, the bill would total $1.5 billion.
That sum may be nothing to sneeze at. But according to labor economists, roughly half of the cost of this fringe benefit would come out of wages. And employers' share would be further pared by the reduction in labor turnover costs: Some workers who are not granted leaves would simply quit. In any case, $1.5 billion represents just one-twentieth of 1 percent of labor compensation.
Why, then, is Mr. Bush apparently willing to be tarred as the President who kept working moms from their tots' sickbeds? There is the camel's nose theory: Mr. Bush's advisers may fear that unpaid leave in large businesses could lead to, say, paid leave for all job holders. Or it could help the prospects of a Massachusetts-style program mandating health insurance for all employees -- anathema to Administration economists. In the view of some analysts close to the White House, however, it is just reflexive opposition to government interference in labor markets.
The Feds already bar child labor, set minimum wages and maximum working hours, regulate pension plans, collect payroll taxes for unemployment compensation and Social Security, and keep watch on shop-floor health and safety. But the President's fight last year to stop an increase in a minimum wage that had been badly eroded by inflation suggests that he is not inclined to look the other way on mandated benefits. And sometimes the lure of a good fight over a simply stated principle is too much even for a pragmatist to resist.

HEADLINE: Gorbachev Meets Kaifu and Both Urge Flexibility

BYLINE: By STEVEN R. WEISMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, April 16

 BODY:
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev and Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu, opening the first high-level attempt at warmer ties between the Soviet Union and Japan, appealed to each other today to show greater flexibility on a territorial dispute long dividing the two countries.
In a friendly atmosphere on a sunny spring day, the two leaders sparred politely during the first of several negotiating sessions intended to reduce tensions and redefine their relationship. 
 The visit by Mr. Gorbachev, the first by a Soviet leader, was a day of solemn anthems and cannon fire, visits to the Imperial Palace and speeding past gleaming skyscrapers and blossoming cherry trees in Zil limousines brought in from Moscow. Later Mr. Gorbachev will get a chance to travel to Kyoto as Japanese do, by bullet train from Tokyo Station.
The main issue for both sides was whether ties could improve to the extent that Japan would be willing to help Moscow with aid and investment. But on the first day of talks, spokesmen for both leaders indicated that each side continued to hold the other responsible for keeping relations tense.
 
Ties 'Absolutely Not Adequate'
 Mr. Gorbachev was quoted as telling Mr. Kaifu that Moscow had managed to improve ties with the United States, Europe, India, China, Southeast Asia, Australia and New Zealand -- but not with Japan.
Soviet-Japanese relations are "absolutely not adequate," a spokesman quoted him as saying, adding that the level of contacts does not "correspond to the actual weight and prestige" of the two countries.
But a Japanese Foreign Ministry spokesman said Mr. Kaifu responded by asserting that it was up to the Soviet leader to change the atmosphere by offering concessions on the territorial matter, a dispute over some islands at the end of the Kurile chain.
Despite the fact that they are neighbors, Japanese-Soviet trade was less than $6 billion, a relatively paltry sum.
 
Territorial Concessions
 Although rumors have swirled in recent weeks suggesting that Japan might offer billions of dollars in aid to the Russians in exchange for territorial concessions, Japanese Government officials have dismissed them.
But Soviet officials are in town this week to talk up as many joint economic cooperation projects as possible. A senior aide to Mr. Gorbachev, Arkady I. Volsky, told reporters today that Japanese money and experience would be particularly valuable in helping the Soviet Union to convert military enterprises to commercial ventures. He said a plant that made navigation systems might be converted to make video recorders, or a plant that used to make tanks could now make tractors.
Mr. Volsky said that Japan had the know-how because industrial giants like Mitsubishi changed from war production after 1945.
"I'll let you in on a big secret," he said. "Mitsubishi used to make tanks."
But instead of improving trade and investment ties, the countries have focused their energies on the Kurile Islands dispute.
The key question hovering over the talks was whether Mr. Gorbachev was prepared to make enough of a concession on the islands -- ceding sovereignty of most if not all of them -- in order to warrant large amounts of Japanese aid, investment and technical assistance.
For most of the last 100 years, the disputed islands have been in Japanese hands, but they were seized by the Soviet Union in the closing days of World War II.
Japan regards that seizure as an illegal betrayal that must be redressed before there can even be a peace treaty officially ending war with Moscow. A Japanese official said that in the initial three hours of meeting at the ornate State Guest House, Mr. Gorbachev and Mr. Kaifu spent half their time on that subject.
The spokesman for Mr. Kaifu said that a news blackout had been imposed on all discussions of the territorial issue, including how much money Japan might offer the Soviet Union if it is resolved favorably to Tokyo.
Moscow and Tokyo plan to announce agreement on 15 topics when the meetings wind up on Thursday, before Mr. Gorbachev's departure on Friday, but few of them amount to a significant financial breakthrough. One economic accord involves Japan sending 300 specialists to help the Russians bring about a restructuring of their economy.
There was tight security throughout the capital, although the police watched quietly as a thousand right-wing marchers took over a street in the Ginza in the afternoon to demand return of all the islands demanded by Japan.
Nations throughout the region, and perhaps throughout the world, were watching the Gorbachev-Kaifu summit meeting for a glimmering of how the so-called new world order might change life in East Asia, where cold-war and East-West tensions still exist.

HEADLINE: Weicker to Close 19 More Parks in Labor Dispute

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HARTFORD, April 16

 BODY:
Gov. Lowell P. Weicker Jr. said today that 19 more state parks would close on Friday, the day before the opening of the fishing season, because the state cannot reach a resolution with state employee unions over wage and benefit givebacks.
The move seemed certain to increase public pressure on the unions, especially when tied to the second half of the today's announcement -- that all the parks would immediately reopen if the labor talks were properly resolved. 
 Five other parks will close on Wednesday, as was previously announced, as a result of budget cuts, and another eight parks are scheduled to close on May 1. When the final closings take effect, more than a third of Connecticut's 92 state parks and forests will be closed as a result of the budget problems in Hartford, caused mainly by the recession and the resulting shortfall in tax revenues.
Of the 19 additional parks, many are small but several draw more than 50,000 visitors a season, including Harkness Memorial Park in Waterford, which drew 187,000 people in 1989 and Gay City State Park in Hebron, with 98,000 visitors, according to the most recent figures,
 
More Layoffs Possible
 Mr. Weicker said that the lack of a union agreement, and the possibility that more state employees could be laid off beyond the 2,600 announced two weeks ago, made it inappropriate to hire the usual number of seasonal workers. The Governor authorized only 82 positions to be filled, instead of the 298 summer workers sought by the Environmental Protection Department -- mostly students hired to clean up and maintain the picnic grounds and beaches.
By redeploying current full-time employees, all 14 state campgrounds will open this weekend as scheduled, said the Environmental Protection Commissioner, Timothy R. E. Keeney, in a statement. The most heavily used state parks, most on Long Island Sound, will also open, Mr. Keeney said, though with less parking than usual.
Mr. Keeney said that 60 public parks and forests and the state campgrounds will remain fully open, and that even the closed parks will be open if people want to park their cars outside the grounds and walk in for day hiking, or picnicking. All access roads will be closed to vehicles, and there will be no electricity or running water or lifeguards. Mr. Keeney said that "minimum law enforcement" would continue in the closed areas, mainly through periodic police patrols.

HEADLINE: COMPANY EARNINGS;
Pacific Telesis Advances Slightly

BYLINE: By BARNABY J. FEDER

 BODY:
Pacific Telesis yesterday reported a slight earnings gain, while two sister Baby Bells, Ameritech and Southwestern Bell, posted modest declines. Analysts said the figures showed that all the telephone companies were feeling the impact of slower growth during the recession, especially among business customers.
United Telecommunications Inc., the owner of U S Sprint, reported that earnings dropped sharply from a year ago but were up from the previous quarter. Analysts who follow the long-distance companies use comparisons with the previous quarter to determine who is gaining market share, but it will be unclear how favorable yesterday's figures were for Sprint until the American Telephone and Telegraph Company, the market leader, and MCI Communications Corporation, No. 2 in long distance, report their earnings. 
 Following are details of the companies' results:
 
Pacific Telesis
 The Pacific Telesis Group said that earnings crept forward 1.5 percent in the first three months of 1991, to $266 million, from $262 million a year ago. Because the San Francisco-based company bought back nearly 10 million of its own shares during the year, the income gain lifted earnings per share by 4.6 percent, to 68 cents, from 65 cents in 1990's first quarter.
Revenues climbed by just 1.7 percent, to $2.41 billion for the quarter from $2.37 billion in the 1990 period.
The company's performance closely tracked that of its main operating unit, Pacific Bell, which provides service in California. Pacific Bell's net income rose 1.2 percent, to $245 million from $242 million, as revenues rose 1.9 percent, to $2.16 billion.
The brightest spot continued to be Telesis's cellular phone companies, where net income rose 21 percent, to $20.5 million, from $16.9 million a year ago, despite a 12.5 percent decline in revenue per customer. Telesis attributed the decline, to $91 a customer from $104, to both the weak economy and the effect of bargain calling plans. The negative impact was overcome by the addition of 34,000 new subscribers, a 31.5 percent increase, to 543,000.
On the New York Stock Exchange yesterday, Pacific Telesis's shares added 37.5 cents, to $41.875.
 
Southwestern Bell
 Southwestern Bell, which is based in St. Louis, said it earned $223.9 million, or 75 cents a share, in the quarter, down 9.6 percent, from $247.8 million, or 82 cents a share in the first quarter of 1990. Revenues were $2.14 billion, compared with $2.13 billion a year ago.
Edward E. Whitacre Jr., chairman and chief executive, attributed the decline to a $37 million decline in income at the company's main subsidiary, the Southwestern Bell Telephone Company. The decline was $13 million when extraordinary gains last year were eliminated from the comparison. The main operating problem was changes in Texas regulations that led to price cuts to customers in that state.
"Although we felt the impact of rate reductions in the first quarter, we're encouraged by continuing growth in operations," Mr. Whitacre said. The company added 90,000 new access lines, bring its total to 12.2 million. The company's cellular phone subsidiary added 64,000 new subscribers in the quarter, bringing the total to 731,000 in 28 cities.
Southwestern's shares were unchanged yesterday at $53.375.
 
Ameritech
 Ameritech said that net income fell 6.8 percent, to $283 million, or $1.07 a share in the first quarter, from $303.5 million, or $1.13 a share a year ago. Revenues for the Chicago-based company were essentially stagnant, rising just $9.4 million, to $2.63 billion.
Rate reductions, slower growth in the addition of new lines, and reduced calling volumes all hurt results, said William L. Weiss, Ameritech's chairman and chief executive. The company's local phone operations serve Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, Michigan and Wisconsin.
Mr. Weiss said that new lines were added at a rate one-third below the first quarter of 1990. The total of 16.4 million is up just 2.1 percent from a year ago. But the cellular business grew at a 42.5 percent rate, to 366,500 subscribers.
Return on equity dropped to 14.4 percent, from 15.8 percent a year ago. Ameritech's shares slipped 62.5 cents yesterday, to $65, in Big Board trading.
 
United Telecom
 United Telecom's net income fell 22.3 percent, to $83.6 million, or 38 cents a share, from $107.6 million, or 51 cents a share in the first quarter of 1990. But net income rose 18 percent, compared with the $71 million reported in the last quarter of 1990.
"Despite recessionary trends and continued intense competition, our Sprint long-distance division experienced strong traffic volume growth of 4.7 percent," said William T. Esrey, United Telecom's chairman and chief executive, comparing the recent quarter with the last three months of 1990.
The Kansas City, Mo., company said that revenues were $2.16 billion for the quarter, up almost 7 percent, from $2.02 billion a year ago. Sprint's revenues accounted for $1.34 billion of that total, up 9.8 percent from the $1.22 billion of the corresponding quarter in 1990 but basically unchanged from the previous three months. The long- distance company's operating profit was $52 million, down 39 percent from $85 million a year ago but up slightly from $51 million in the last quarter of 1990.
United Telecom's shares rose $2, to $25 yesterday, on the New York Stock Exchange.

Technologies' Net Off 70.1%

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: HARTFORD, April 16

 BODY:
The United Technologies Corporation today reported a 70.1 percent slump in its first-quarter net income, saying the recession had hurt three of its key businesses: aircraft components, building supplies and automobile parts.
The company said earnings of $40.2 million, or 25 cents a share, in the quarter were down from $134.5 million, or $1.05 a share, in the 1990 period. Sales were virtually unchanged at $4.8 billion. 
 Robert Daniell, the company's chairman, said cost-cutting measures would continue "on the assumption that the recession is nearing an end."
The Pratt & Whitney subsidiary, which builds commercial aircraft engines, suffered a slump of more than 25 percent in spare parts revenues as carriers struggled with empty seats and cut spending.
The company's shares fell $1.125, to $46.50, in New York Stock Exchange trading.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Trading in Dollar Is Mixed On Uncertainty Over Rates

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar, stymied by uncertainty over United States interest rates, turned in a mixed performance against other major currencies yesterday.
Gold prices were narrowly lower in New York, with the April contract falling 20 cents, to $361.40 an ounce, on the Commodity Exchange in New York. The Republic National Bank later quoted a bid of $359.85 an ounce, down 45 cents. 
 Analysts said the foreign exchange markets were awaiting more clues about the United States economy and where interest rates were headed.
On Monday, the Federal Reserve took steps that the markets interpreted as indicating the central bank would not allow interest rates to fall to stimulate the economy.
 
Signs of Weakness
 But yesterday the Commerce Department said housing starts fell 9.3 percent in March, while the Fed said industrial production fell three-tenths of a percent in last month. Both reports provided more evidence that the economy remained weak. But after Monday's Fed action, the markets were unsure what the central bank would do.
The dollar, which traded in a narrow range for much of the day, gained ground against the British pound. In New York, sterling fell to $1.7905, from late Monday's $1.7910. In earlier London trading, the pound fell to $1.7900, from $1.7920 late on Monday.
The dollar also picked up some ground against the Japanese yen. The dollar rose to 134.60 yen in New York, from 134.25, after falling overnight in Tokyo to 135.15 yen, from 135.22. It was quoted at 134.80 yen in London.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Monday prices, included: 1.6648 German marks, down from 1.6710; 1.4170 Swiss francs, down from 1.4185; 5.6265 French francs, down from 5.6385; 1,234.00 Italian lire, down from 1,237.25, and 1.14905 Canadian dollars, up from 1.14815.
Gold was unchanged in London at $360.50 an ounce, the same as late on Monday. In Zurich, the metal fell to a closing bid of $360.75 an ounce, down from $361.20 late on Monday. In Hong Kong, gold rose 32 cents an ounce to close at $361.12.
Silver rose 3 cents on the Commodity Exchange, closing at $4.011 an ounce. In earlier London trading, silver rose to a late bid of $4.04 an ounce, up from $3.98 late on Monday.

Trump Report On Finances

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: ATLANTIC CITY, April 16

 BODY:
A report prepared by the New Jersey Gaming Enforcement Division says the Trump Organization will topple unless it completes agreements with creditors owed nearly $2 billion on assets owned by Donald J. Trump.
The New Jersey agency prepared the report as part of the relicensing hearings for the Trump Taj Mahal Casino. The state Casino Control Commission must determine if the casino and the New York-based Trump Organization can prove financial stability. 
 "There does appear to be a sufficient level of financial stability for the remainder of the current license term, which expires on April 26, 1991, and for the one-year term that follows," said the division, part of the Attorney General's office.
The casino's stability depends upon completion of a restructuring plan that has holders of $675 million in Taj casino bonds accepting lower interest rates in exchange for 50 percent of the property.
"More worrisome is the fiscal health of D.J.T.," the report said, using Mr. Trump's initials. He will go broke by July if his lenders do not negotiate new debt arrangements, the report said.
Mr. Trump will have personal income this year of $1.7 million from rental income, trust distributions, interest income and other sources, the report said. As income-generating assets are sold, the figure will fall to $700,000 in 1992 and $300,000 in 1993, the report said.

HEADLINE: Yields Decline for 7th Week

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO

 BODY:
Yields on certificates of deposit and money market accounts fell for the seventh consecutive week in the period ended yesterday, with most declines on the moderate side.
Analysts at The Bank Rate Monitor, an interest rate publication based in North Palm Beach, Fla., note that yield spreads among money market funds, funds that invest in United States Treasury securities and bank money market accounts have narrowed considerably since the beginning of the year. Money market and Treasury funds had yielded as much as 175 basis points more than the average bank money market account, but as recently as last week the spread had narrowed to as little as 50 basis points. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. 
 At the Treasury Department's weekly auction of three- and six-month bills on Monday, average discount rates slipped for the third consecutive week. The results of these bill auctions often indicate what banks may eventually pay on money market accounts and certificates of deposit.
The three-month bill fell 3 basis points, to 5.57 percent, while the six-month bill slipped a basis point, to 5.67 percent, the lowest since July 1987.
In its weekly survey of New York area banks, The Bank Rate Monitor noted that the declines at commercial banks were larger than those at savings institutions for the second consecutive week.
This week, the largest yield declines in the New York area were recorded at First Fidelity of New Jersey, which cut its money market account by 115 basis points, to 4 percent; Midlantic Banks of New Jersey, which cut its three-month certificate by 25 basis points, to 5.75 percent, and the Republic National Bank, which cut its six-month certificate by 32 basis points, to 5.97 percent.
Commercial banks lowered the average money market account by 11 basis points, to 5.39 percent, and lowered three-month certificates by 9 basis points, to 5.84 percent. The longer six-month ceritificate was cut 6 basis points, to 6.01 percent.
At savings institutions, the average money market account was lowered 2 basis points, to 5.76 percent, while a three-month certificate was cut by 8 basis points, to 6.25 percent, and a six-month certificate by 6 basis points, to 6.49 percent.
Yields at 20 large banks outside the New York area and around the country show the average money market account yield down 2 basis points, to 5.41 percent, with the average yield for a six-month certificate down 6 basis points, to 6.03 percent.

Annual effective yields, in percent, on money market accounts, three-month certificates of deposit and six-month C.D.'s expected at selected institutions on Wednesday, April 17, 1991. Some C.D. yields assume reinvestment after maturity. Yields are based on the method of compounding and the rate stated for the lowest minimum to open an account, but minimums may vary. Higher yields may be offered for larger deposits. C.D. figures are for fixed rates only.

HEADLINE: Housing Starts Fell 9% in March

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 16

 BODY:
In reports suggesting that the recession could linger beyond midyear, the Government said today that the pace at which builders broke ground for new homes fell 9 percent in March while production of the nation's factories, mines and utilities fell three-tenths of a percent.
Private analysts generally took a dim view of the reports, despite a 2.4 percent increase in housing permits, the second straight monthly rise. 
 Housing starts are widely watched because they send large ripples through the economy, leading inevitably to sales of new carpeting, appliances and other goods.
 
Housing May Have Bottomed
 Permits for future home construction, reported today with housing starts, are a forward-looking indicator. For March, the indicator seemed to be moving in line with other data indicating that the housing market, at least, may have begun to rise from a bottom reached during the winter.
The decline in industrial production, although a bit less than expected, was broadly based, analysts noted, and was accompanied by a decline of four-tenths of a point in the operating rate of factories, mines and utilities. At 78.7 percent, the overall operating rate is at its lowest point since September 1986, when it measured 78.6 percent. The rate for factories alone, 77.4, is the lowest since August 1983, when it was 76.0.
"The numbers are very dismal," said Lacy H. Hunt, chief United States economist for the Hongkong Bank Group. "Without question, they show the recession is continuing and the recovery is nowhere in sight." Even housing, he added, has shown only "minimal" revival from the severely depressed pace of 847,000 starts in January.
The March pace of 901,000 housing starts followed a surge in February to 993,000, producing an average of 947,000 starts for the latest two months.
 
Home Builders Optimistic
 Another downbeat assessment came from the United States Chamber of Commerce, which cited a sixth straight month of falling industrial output and complained that the Federal Reserve has been too slow to cut interest rates to encourage a recovery.
"Today's figures suggest that the recession will not be shorter and shallower than the average of postwar recessions," said Richard W. Rahn, the chamber's vice president and chief economist. "Therefore, it is peculiar, at the very least, that policy makers seem hell-bent on maintaining the status quo in hopes that a recovery will magically appear."
Yet the National Association of Home Builders, the industry's principal trade association, took some comfort in the housing figures and declared that January "was clearly the low point" for the battered industry.
Mark Ellis Tipton, the group's president, said that housing starts had been expected to fall in March, since the February total had been inflated by exceptionally mild weather in much of the country, particularly the Midwest.
Mr. Tipton added, "Although the March numbers are weaker than expected, we believe the housing economy is starting to build some momentum" with the aid of the lowest mortgage rates in almost a decade.
The Fed continued to refrain from starting another round of interest rate cuts to pull the economy out of recession, perhaps in the belief that the economy, though weak in most sectors, is stabilizing.
 
Housing Starts
 The March decline in housing starts embraced all kinds of structures and two of the four regions of the country.
Starts of single-family housing fell 5.9 percent, to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 732,000, while starts for multiple-unit dwellings fell 21.4 percent, to a record low pace of 169,000. Single-family starts ran at a 778,000 rate in February, while multifamily starts ran at a rate of 215,000, the Commerce Department reported.
By region, starts rose by 7,000 in the Northeast, to 97,000, and by 5,000 in the South, to 393,000. But starts fell 80,000 in the Midwest, to 223,000, and dropped 24,000 in the West, to 188,000.
Without seasonal adjustment or annualization, 74,100 houses were actually started last month, 61,200 of them single-family units. This compared with 45,700 single-family starts in February and 39,200 in January.
For permits, the March pace was 884,000, 2.4 percent above the revised February pace of 863,000 but still 28 percent below the figure a year earlier. All of the March gain, which was concentrated in the West, was accounted for by multifamily dwellings.
The report also showed that shipments of mobile homes, which are published with a one-month lag, fell to 157,000 in February, 7 percent below the January level of 168,000.
 
Industrial Production
 The three-tenths of a percent fall in industrial production last month followed a decline of nine-tenths of a percent in February and was the smallest of the string of declines that began in October.
Nonetheless, the Fed's report noted, for the first quarter as a whole output fell at an annual rate of about 9.25 percent, compared with 7 percent in the final three months of 1990.
The March decline put the production index at 105.3. That is 3.3 percent below the March 1990 index, and the lowest level since a 105.0 reading in June 1988.
The drop in March was attributed mainly to further weakness in business equipment, construction supplies and durable materials. Output of motor vehicles rose about 2.5 percent, as a sharp increase in truck production more than offset another decline in automobiles.
 
Food Production Up
 By market groups, production of consumer goods apart from motor vehicles rose a modest four-tenths of a percent last month after falling for four straight months, the Fed reported. Food and energy bought by consumers, particularly residential electricity, advanced last month, but clothing and household goods like appliances, carpeting and furniture remained depressed.
Business equipment fell another five-tenths of a percent and construction supplies fell 1.6 percent, the report showed.
Manufacturing output fell five-tenths of a percent, with operating rates falling that amount for both primary and advanced processing industries.
 
Mining Output Down
 Mining output also fell, by eight-tenths of a percent, but utility output climbed 1.4 percent to regain nearly half of the ground lost in February, reflecting unseasonably warm weather during that month.
The biggest declines in the operating, or capacity utilization, rate among primary processing industries last month were in stone, clay and glass products and in fabricated metals, the former 10 points below its March 1990 level. Lumber, another construction-related industry, is now operating at 72.4 percent, 13 points below its pace a year earlier.
The February decline in overall production was revised to nine-tenths of 1 percent from the eight-tenths of 1 percent initially reported.

HEADLINE: COMPANY NEWS;
New York Takes Over Big Insurer

BYLINE: By EBEN SHAPIRO

 BODY:
New York State insurance regulators yesterday seized control of the Executive Life Insurance Company of New York, the New York unit of the First Executive Corporation.
Salvatore R. Curiale, New York's superintendent of insurance, said the move had been taken after worried policyholders rushed to cash in their policies, threatening the company's financial health. At a news conference yesterday, Mr. Curiale said he was indefinitely suspending all policy surrenders, the procedure for policyholders to withdraw their funds quickly. 
 Death benefits, annuity payments, pensions and other regular payments will be honored without interruption, Mr. Curiale said.
It is the largest seizure of an insurance company in state history and the first time the state has come to the rescue of a troubled insurer since 1974.
"The whole purpose of this is to stabilize the situation and assure people that we are in control," Mr. Curiale said.
 
No Risk for Now
 No state funds are at risk in the seizure, and no policyholders are at risk at this point, officials said.
Last week, in the largest failure of an American insurer, California regulators took control of the Executive Life Insurance Company of California, the largest insurance unit of First Executive. The state placed Executive Life into a court-supervised conservatorship.
First Executive, headed by Fred Carr, grew into one of the nation's largest insurers by investing heavily in high-yield "junk bonds." First Executive's finances deteriorated along with the junk bond market.
Executive Life Insurance Company of New York is considered to be in better financial shape than the California unit. In 1987, the State of New York restricted junk bond investments by insurance companies.
Earlier this month, New York officials ordered Executive Life of New York to stop issuing new polices and to bolster its reserve by $125 million.
As of Dec. 31, the company had assets of $3.2 billion and liabilities of $3 billion. The company has 103,000 policyholders in 23 states, but the majority live in New York.
 
Policies Are Surrendered
 Mr. Curiale said that in recent days there was a sharp rise in the number of policyholders trying to cash in their policies. He said the number had risen to nearly 500 a day, from 25 a day several weeks ago.
"The growing rush to withdraw capital assets from the company threatens its solvency and undermines the ability of the company to meet its obligations," he said.
While officials say policyholders are not at risk, Mr. Curiale acknowledged that the company had financial difficulties and that about 60 percent of the company's investment portfolio is invested in high-risk "junk bonds." The value of the portfolio has eroded during the recession.
Regulators received a temporary restraining order Monday night, allowing them to take control of the company, which is based in Jericho, L.I. The department will seek a permanent court order next Tuesday.
Insurance department officials said the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company of New York had sought to take a lead role in providing management help to reorganize the insurer.
Metropolitan Life officials said they supported the actions of the insurance superintendent, but declined to discuss their plans. Insurance officials said other large insurers had also expressed interest in helping resolve First Executive's problems.
The New York insurance industry has a financial interest in a quick resolution to First Executive's problems. If First Executive is unable to pay its obligations, the New York Life Insurance Guaranty Corporation, a group made up of insurance companies, will be financially responsible. "They have a financial interest in seeing that this thing plays out successfully," said Kevin Foley, deputy superintendent of insurance.
 
Plan by Europeans
 A European consortium, which includes Altus Finance, a unit of Credit Lyonnais, has presented a plan to buy the California unit of First Executive and is now interested in the New York company as well.
A spoksman for Altus said the group hoped to have discussions with the insurance department about an acquisition within the next few days. "The consortium is prepared to commit a sizable sum," said the spokesman, who insisted on anonymity.
Once the state stabilizes First Executive and analyzes its financial health, it has several options, Mr. Foley said. Mr. Foley said a takeover of the company was one option, as was selling it in pieces. "We would like to keep the company together," he said.
Mr. Curiale said that the state was likely to be in control of the insurer for a few months, possibly more.

HEADLINE: Settlement Defeat Speeds Film Exodus From New York

BYLINE: By JAMES BARRON

 BODY:
The exodus of feature films from New York City resumed with surprising speed yesterday, a day after a film-crafts union defeated a tentative settlement in a 19-week dispute that had put a number of productions on hold.
The departures, by producers who had been planning to shoot movies about New York in New York, are creating potential windfalls for cities like Chicago, Pittsburgh and Toronto -- places with urban streetscapes that could fool the camera and perhaps some moviegoers. 
 Jaynne C. Keyes, director of the Mayor's Office of Film, Theater and Broadcasting, said that "Frankie and Johnny in the Claire de Lune" -- about a quintessential New York love story -- and "The Babe Ruth Story" -- about one of the most famous Yankees of all time -- were among at least seven films that would be shot elsewhere.
 The prospect of no lights, cameras or action appeared to increase the pressure on the unions that negotiated the tentative settlement with Hollywood producers last month. The president of the unions' umbrella group, Alfred W. DiTolla, said 10 East Coast locals had drawn up a petition complaining that the local that voted against the settlement "has placed them in imminent danger."
The producers contended that the local that rejected the contract proposal, Local 52 of the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees and Moving Picture Machine Operators, had reneged on a promise to recommend the deal to the local's rank and file.
 The producers, through the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers in Sherman Oaks, Calif., said that they had made concessions in the negotiations based on assurances that Local 52 would recommend ratification.
Yesterday the alliance issued a statement denouncing Local 52's failure to urge ratification as "outrageous and unprecedented."
"Local 52's leadership has no interest in reaching an agreement with the producers," the statement from the alliance said.
Ray Fortune, the business manager of Local 52, denied the allegation. "Wally and I did not have the power to make any kinds of deals," he said, referring to the president of Local 52, Walter Stocklin.
"We took it back to the rest of the negotiating committee," an 18-person panel that did not go to California for the bargaining, Mr. Fortune said. That group and Local 52's executive board voted not to recommend the settlement to the members, he said. Mr. DiTolla said the issue would be discussed at a union meeting next week.
The producers indicated that they would continue to steer big-budget productions away from New York, as they have done since last fall, and city officials expressed new concerns about the economic consequences. Movie making is estimated to generate from $500 million to $2.5 billion a year in fees to the city and in jobs for everyone from actors and camera operators to caterers.
But it is hard to quantify the total cost of the filmmaking boycott in dollars. By another measure, last year was the busiest for feature-filmmaking that New York has ever had. Ms. Keyes said that 139 full-length films were shot in the city in 1990, up from 110 in 1989.
The business manager of one of the other unions that negotiated with the producers, Louis D'Agostino of Local 644 of the International Photographers of the Motion Picture and Television Industries, said he was concerned that the vote by Local 52 would hurt the industry. Local 644's members are still voting on the proposed contract by mail. Ratification is expected.
Ms. Keyes named at least seven films that she said were heading for other locations. The Martin Scorsese production of "Mad Dog and Glory" -- set in the Bronx -- is being moved to Chicago. "With this dispute going on, they felt it was perhaps too dangerous" to film in New York, a spokesman, Marion Billings, said of the production team. She did not elaborate.
The other four films, Ms. Keyes said, were "Mambo Kings," which has been shifted to Los Angeles; "The Analyst," starring Richard Gere, which had been moved to San Francisco; and two films that would be shot in Chicago, "Prelude to a Kiss" and "The Gladiator."
The film version of "Frankie and Johnny" will go before the cameras on schedule next month with Al Pacino and Michelle Pfeiffer in the leading roles, but not in New York. The producers have not decided where to set up shop, but are said to be considering Pittsburgh, Toronto and Chicago.

HEADLINE: CUOMO SEEKS SHIFT IN CITY FISCAL RULE

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH KOLBERT, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ALBANY, April 16

 BODY:
Adding to the growing edginess over New York City's finances, Gov. Mario M. Cuomo suggested today that the city be allowed to run up a larger deficit before a state panel steps in to take control of its budget.
The Governor's comments come amid anxiety here that the city, with its finances deteriorating almost daily, will not be able to avoid a takeover this summer by the state panel, known as the Financial Control Board. 
 Today, the city offered its first official estimate of its worsening budget situation. The city's Budget Director, Philip R. Michael, estimated that the gap for this fiscal year was now $465 million, although he said he had a plan for closing roughly half of it through reserve funds and spending cuts.
 
Trigger for Takeover
 Under state law, the Financial Control Board would take over the city's finances if the city ended its fiscal year with a deficit of more than $100 million. The Governor suggested today that that figure be adjusted upward for inflation since the law setting it was passed in 1975.
Mr. Cuomo's comments baffled many financial experts, who said the changes the Governor was suggesting probably were not legal because the $100 million takeover trigger appears to be included in bond covenants -- the guarantees the city gives to investors when it sells bonds.
Today's remarks by the Governor were the latest in a series of veiled statements he has made on Mayor David N. Dinkins's budget problems, and they seemed to have a dual message -- half fiscal, half political.
In part, they seemed aimed at countering charges by some city officials that Mr. Cuomo has not been aggressive enough in staving off a possible takeover by the Financial Control Board, of which he is the chairman. And they seemed intended to bolster the Governor's case, if there is ever a takeover, that he sought to avert it.
"I want the world to know that I am very, very much opposed to control," the Governor said in an interview after a news conference today. "I may not be able to stop it, but control is not desirable."
 
A Pointed Declaration
 Yet at the same time that he was suggesting technical ways to avert a control board takeover, Mr. Cuomo pointedly declared today that the state had no means of providing the city with cash to balance its budget during its current fiscal year, which ends on June 30.
Earlier Mr. Cuomo had suggested that the state might be able to provide some assistance to the city through complicated deals involving the sale of bonds by the Battery Park City Authority, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey or the Municipal Assistance Corporation. But as a condition for this aid, he said the city would have to extract concessions from its workers.
This evening, as the city moved closer to the end of its fiscal year with a budget gap now pegged at about $465 million and as the state entered the third week of its fiscal year with budget talks still mired in confusion, New York seemed to be staggering toward a crisis born of sheer inaction.
While the various factions involved in the budget negotiations -- the Mayor, the State Legislature and the municipal labor unions, to name a few -- continued to wrangle over who was responsible for the disarray, talks remained deadlocked.
"We are now apparently in a situation that appears to be stalemated," Norman Steisel, the city's First Deputy Mayor, said. "We need to move on several fronts simultaneously."
But even the new urgency provided by news that the city's budget gap was getting worse has not made any of the participants in the discussions budge enough to make compromise possible. While Mr. Cuomo, for example, has linked additional aid to the city to concessions from the unions, union leaders have tied concessions to a detailed plan from the Governor about how the state intends to help.
 
Particularly Crucial
 The current round of budget talks is particularly crucial to the city because if it ends its fiscal year with a deficit of more than $100 million, its finances would be subject to a takeover by the Financial Control Board. The board was established during the city's fiscal crisis of the mid-1970's, and it ran the city's finances for several years.
Under the recommendation made today, which he first mentioned in a Newsday interview on Monday, the $100 million control board trigger would be raised to something closer to $300 million.
"If there is some legal way," Mr. Cuomo said, "to deal with technical problems that arise out of $100 million holes, when that's a 1975 requirement, and that can somehow legally be stretched so that you're talking about the same value, $100 million given inflation, well, that could be an interesting approach."
"I'm not at all sure that's possible," he added.
 
'Nothing Magic'
 Several fiscal analysts concurred in this doubt.
"There are contracts out there that are predicated on the statutes as they exist," said Maury Cooper, senior vice president at Standard & Poor's, the bond rating agency. "There's nothing magic about $100 million. But what's disturbing are the circumstances that make it necessary to consider this change."
Mayor Dinkins, too, said he doubted the change would be legal. And in what appeared to be a cautious and rather cryptic rebuke of the Governor, Mr. Dinkins said today: "If there is the capacity to do something as chairman of the control board, I am hopeful there is capacity to do that as Governor, and the Governor will do those things."
 
Trial Balloons
 The State Comptroller, Edward V. Regan, was critical of both the Governor and the Mayor, saying they were spending more time posturing and floating trial balloons than addressing the substantive fiscal issues.
"I think it is diversionary," he said of the Governor's latest recommendation. "The issue is: Will the state pass a budget and will the city give us good tough management and solid figures?"
In Albany today, the prospects for the state's passing any budget soon appeared dim. Aides to the Governor and the Assembly Speaker, Mel Miller, reported that the two had had a heated argument over the telephone and that the day's desultory talks had produced no signs of progress.
In his frustration, Mr. Cuomo went so far today as to suggest that rank-and-file legislators get involved in budget talks, which are usually conducted in private by the Governor, the Assembly Speaker and the State Senate majority leader.
"I think you have to try something radically different," Mr. Cuomo said.

4 Big Banks Post Drops In Profits

BYLINE: By MICHAEL QUINT

 BODY:
Four of the nation's 10 largest banking companies announced substantially lower quarterly profits yesterday, with Citicorp's falling the most.
Citicorp said its profits fell nearly 70 percent in the first quarter as the weak economy and rising unemployment caused a buildup in delinquent and defaulted loans among consumers. It also cited its already high level of troubled loans for commercial real estate projects. 
 Citicorp was joined by Security Pacific, Chemical Banking and Manufacturers Hanover in announcing declines in profits from the quarter a year earlier. Although none of the large banks reported big losses or reduced dividends, as they did on occasion in 1990, their profits were below the levels that analysts say are needed for long-term health. All four reported fewer loans on their books in the first quarter than in the last quarter of 1990.
Despite the declines, many bank stocks posted strong gains yesterday as the Dow Jones industrial average rose 53.71 points, to a 1991 high of 2,986.88. [Page D8.]
 
Lackluster Recovery
 John S. Reed, Citicorp chairman, said he expected the economy to improve before the end of the year. "But there is little evidence of this now," he said. "Nor is there reason to expect a robust recovery."
While waiting for the economy to improve, banks have reaped only limited benefits from the Federal Reserve's moves to push interest rates lower. Falling interest rates have helped many banks by allowing them to reduce interest rates paid on deposits and borrowed funds faster than they cut rates charged on loans. But the drops have not prevented losses on defaulted or delinquent loans.
"The improvement in their interest margin is being eroded by the costs of poor-quality loans," said Thomas Hanley, a banking analyst at Salomon Brothers.
Outside New York, in regions where the economy was not so depressed and loan problems were less severe, profits improved or were stable at several large banks.
PNC Financial and Mellon Bank, both in Pittsburgh, said profits had improved 18.7 percent and 4.6 percent, respectively. Banc One of Columbus, Ohio, said profits had increased 18.6 percent. Wells Fargo of San Franciso said profits fell about 5 percent.
Because of the dismal earnings posted last year, recent reports by banks have tended to be better than many analysts had forecast, often resulting in rising stock prices. At Wells Fargo, for example, the absence of a sharp rise in bad real estate loans caused its stock to rise $7.50, to $80. Other companies with good-sized gains included Security Pacific, up $1.875, to $26.25, and PNC, up $1.875, to $32.625.
Citicorp rose 37.5 cents, to $16.375; Chemical 75 cents, to $20.375, and Manufactuers Hanover 87.5 cents, to $27.875. Mellon gained $1.375, to $31.875, and Banc One climbed $1, to $38.75.
Following are details of the banking companies' results:
 
Citicorp
 Citicorp, the nation's largest issuer of credit cards and home mortgages, said the increase in bad and delinquent loans for individual customers was an important reason for its profit decline of 69.7 percent, to $70 million, or 10 cents a share, from $231 million, or 60 cents a share, in 1990's first quarter. The 1990 figure does not include a gain of $140 million from an accounting adjustment.
Worldwide consumer banking earned only $174 million in the first quarter, down from $270 million a year earlier.
 
Delinquencies Continue
 Although Citicorp has not yet published delinquency rates in credit cards and mortgage loans for the first quarter, Thomas Jones, its chief financial officer, noted that last year's trend toward higher delinquincies had continued. Following its standard practice of writing off after 180 days of delinquency all credit card loans and all mortgage loans in excess of the home value, Citicorp charged as a loss $430 million of consumer loans in the first quarter, up from $369 million in the fourth quarter of 1990. Reflecting the negative trend in delinquencies, Citicorp added $531 million to its reserve for consumer loan losses, or $100 million more than it wrote off as a loss.
The economic downturn also hurt Citicorp's consumer business by reducing the use of credit cards and the growth in its customer base. Revenues from consumer banking grew at a 9 percent annual rate in the first quarter, the first time in several years growth had fallen to less than 10 percent.
Commercial real etate loans continue to be the weakest segment of Citicorp's corporate banking group in North America, Europe and Japan, accounting for $402 million of the $752 million increase in nonperforming loans. Nonperforming loans in the group totaled $5.5 billion.
 
Adding Capital
 Mr. Reed said Citicorp planned to add $750 million of capital in the future with profits from the sale of assets or some other arrangement, like taking a partner in part of its business. He said that idea of selling part of the credit card business -- a move that would also have the benefit of reducing the company's reliance on that single line of business "won't happen by July," but "may happen this year."
After raising more than $1.2 billion of capital through the private sale of preferred stock to a Saudi Arabian prince and other investors, Mr. Reed said Citicorp still intended to strengthen its captial, but was not inclined to make a public offering until later in the year "if it's a favorable market."
 
Chemical Banking
 The weakness in the New York area economy was also apparent at the Chemical Banking Corporation, which reported first-quarter profits of $87 million, or 74 cents a share, down 14.4 percent from $101.7 million, or $1.16 a share, a year earlier. The 1990 figure excludes a gain of $54 million resulting from the profits from the sale of an investment in a Florida banking company and a special charge for the cost of reducing its payroll.
Chemical's earnings were hurt by the addition of $135 million to its reserve for loan losses, up from $70 million a year ago. Nonperforming loans and holdings of real estate acquired from bad loans rose $191 million from the fourth quarter to $3.48 billion.
Texas Commerce Bancshares, a Chemical subsidiary, earned a profit of $27.9 million, up from $18.3 million a year earlier, excluding tax benefits. While Chemical was accumulating bad loans in its New York and New Jersey operations, problem loans at the Texas bank were declining.
 
Manufacturers Hanover
 The Manufacturers Hanover Corporation said first-quarter profits fell 18.8 percent, to $78 million, or 87 cents a share, from $96 million, or $1.21 a share. Increases in net interest income, foreign exchange trading, and a $39 million profit on investment securities were offset by the need to set aside $144 million in the reserve for bad loans, up from $73 million a year ago. The addition of the reserve was, however, much less than the $353 million set aside in the fourth quarter.
John F. McGillicuddy, Manufacturers Hanover's chairman, noted that the bank, like many others, had benefited from an ability to charge higher prices to borrowers as some lenders have pulled out of the market. The difference between interst rates Manufacturers Hanover paid and the rates it collected increased to 2.73 percent, from 2.54 percent in the fourth quarter.
 
Security Pacific
 The Security Pacific Corporation, based in Los Angeles, has been hurt by its real estate lending outside California. It earned $96.5 million, or 71 cents a share, in the first quarter, down 48.8 percent from $188.4 million, or $1.54 a share, in the 1990 period. The bank, which is in the midst of a cost-cutting drive and recently laid off several top bankers in its New York office, is trying to concentrate on the California market.
In the first quarter, Security Pacific set aside $271.1 million in its reserve for bad loans, up from $131.4 million a year earlier, but far below the $624.6 million set aside in the fourth quarter of 1990.
 
Wells Fargo
 Wells Fargo & Company said its drop in profits to $152 million, or $2.86 a share, from $160 million, or $3.04 a share, in 1990's first quarter was related to the cost of combining recently acquired branches of a savings institution with its network.
Although Wells Fargo has heavy concentrations of risky loans for commercial real estate projects and highly indebted companies, it continues to do a better job of avoiding losses than other banks. In the first quarter, it set aside $85 million in its reserve for bad loans, the same as the last quarter of 1990 and up only $10 million from the first quarter of last year. Nonperforming loans rose to $1.1 billion, up only $95 million from the end of the year.
 
PNC Financial
 The PNC Financial Corporation, the holding comapny for the Pittsburgh National Bank, said its increase in first-quarter profits to $88.4 million, or 92 cents a share, from $74.5 million, or 78 cents a share, was accompanied by a decline in troubled loans and a reduction in the amount of reserves set aside to cover loan losses.
Thomas H. O'Brien, PNC's chairman, said "aggressive actions we took last year" were more responsible for the gain than was the improvement in the regions where the company operates. PNC, which owns banks in Pennsylvania, Ohio, Kentucky, Indiana, and New Jersey, lost $168.4 million in the fourth quarter, when it set aside $430 million in a reserve to cover bad loans. In the first quarter, the company set aside only $103.1 million in its reserve, down from $108.9 million a year earlier. Non-performing assets fell $10.7 million from the end of the year, to $1.29 billion.
 
Mellon Bank
 The Mellon Bank Corporation, whose first-quarter profit of $68 million, or $1.25 a share, was up from $65 million, or $1.25 a share, in the 1990 period, also benefited from stable loan quality. The company, whose profits are now back to the high levels that preceeded its problems in the late 1980's, set aside only $45 million for loan losses, down from $175 million in the fourth quarter. A year earlier, it set aside only $35 million.
 
Banc One
 The Banc One Corporation, earned a record $120.7 million, or 75 cents a share, in the first quarter, compared with $101.8 million, or 70 cents a share, for the comparable period last year. Although nonperforming assets rose by 7.6 percent from the end of the year, to $476 million, the company benefited from strong growth in low-cost consumer deposits and good demand for the consumer and small-business loans that are its specialty. The difference between the interest it paid on deposits and the interest received from loans and investments increased to 6.31 percent in the first quarter, from 5.47 percent in the fourth quarter of 1991.

HEADLINE: Poverty Blamed for Blacks' High Cancer Rate

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 16

 BODY:
Poverty, not race, is largely to blame for the higher rate of cancer among blacks than whites, according to a study by scientists at the National Cancer Institute.
The study, which is being published Wednesday in The Journal of the National Cancer Institute, says programs to fight cancer should thus be aimed at poor urban areas rather than at black communities. 
 "Poor Americans constitute a high-risk group for developing and dying of cancer," Dr. Harold Freeman of Harlem Hospital Center in New York wrote in an accompanying editorial. "Accordingly, substantial resources should be directed toward prevention, detection, diagnosis and treatment of cancer in the economically disadvantaged."
In explaining the link between the incidence of cancer and socioeconomic status, he cited poverty's association with low educational levels, substandard living conditions, bad nutrition and poor access to health care.
 
Cancer Rates Compared
 Scientists have long been aware that blacks are significantly more likely than whites to get cancer, and to die sooner once cancer is diagnosed. Depending on the type of cancer and the part of the country, the cancer rate for blacks is 6 to 10 percent higher than that for whites.
In the new study, Dr. Claudia R. Baquet and others at the cancer institute compared black and white cancer rates in Atlanta, Detroit and San Francisco-Oakland from 1978 to 1982.
Then, using data from the 1980 census, they adjusted the data for socioeconomic factors, including population density, education and income levels. The adjustments were used to estimate the cancer rates that would be observed for blacks if they had the same socioeconomic characteristics as whites. The researchers looked at overall cancer risk as well as the risk at some common sites.
While the raw data showed that blacks had a higher risk of cancer over all, the adjusted data showed whites had a higher overall risk. And while the unadjusted data showed whites running a greater risk of breast and rectal cancer only, after adjustment it showed whites running a greater risk of lung cancer, too. After adjustment, blacks still ran a greater risk than whites of stomach, cervical and prostate cancers.
The researchers acknowledged that unidentified racial factors linked to culture or genetics appeared to affect the incidence rates of some cancers.

HEADLINE: Chamorro Pleads With Congress for Increases in Aid

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 16

 BODY:
Speaking in the House chamber where the debate over the war in Nicaragua resonated for years, President Violeta Barrios de Chamorro pleaded today with Congress for increases in economic aid to fortify her country's new democracy.
As she entered the House of Representatives to address a rare joint meeting of Congress, a number of legislators embraced her and kissed her on the cheek, and her half-hour speech was interrupted seven times by enthusiastic applause. The event seemed to symbolize the end of an era in relations between Washington and Managua that was punctuated by the contra war and the Iran-contra scandal. 
 Wearing a red dress and speaking through an interpreter, she recounted her political career, which has spanned Nicaragua's last 14 years of war and revolution. She talked of her assassinated husband, Pedro Joaquin Chamorro, the nine months she worked on a junta dominated by the Sandinista National Liberation Front, and her electoral victory over President Daniel Ortega Saavedra in February 1990.
"In Nicaragua an authentic revolution is beginning," she said. "It is a revolution for democracy and liberty."
 
'Steadfast' Aid Needed
 Mrs. Chamorro emphasized the economic needs of her war-ravaged country, saying, "We need steadfast financial assistance from the United States throughout this entire decade to reconstruct our economy."
The United States has pledged $541 million for Nicaragua since her election, but only about $207 million has been disbursed. The Administration has conditioned its aid on a reform of the banking system and privatization of the statist economy developed over a decade of Sandinista rule.
While her relations with the Bush Administration have been publicly warm, there have been a series of private disputes beginning with her early retention of Humberto Ortega Saavedra, the former President's brother, as commander of the army. Most recently, her aides have complained that the Administration has leaked allegations to the press that there is strong circumstantial evidence linking Sandinista army officials to the assassination in February of Enrique Bermudez, a former contra leader.
In a vague reference to the case, she said: "Justice is one element that cannot be missing from this system. Crimes cannot remain unresolved, as we have witnessed in the past."
Mrs. Chamorro mentioned the word Sandinista only once, and she spoke in generalities. But she sought to distance herself from what she called "the delirium of a totalitarian ideology" and to address concerns expressed by officials in the Administration and Congress that Sandinista units continue to ship arms to guerrillas in El Salvador and Honduras and abuse the human rights of peasants in the countryside.
"It is important to reiterate that Nicaragua does not now tolerate, and will not tolerate the sending of arms by civilians or military men to neighboring countries," she said.
Members of Congress said that Mrs. Chamorro had said all the right things to allay fears that the Sandinistas maintained a large share of power in Nicaragua, but they also said they could not satisfy all her economic needs.
Representative Robert G. Torricelli, Democrat of New Jersey and chairman of the House subcommittee on Western Hemisphere affairs, said: "Her speech could have been written by the State Department. It's a recognition that she understands the reality that she has political problems with this Administration."
Mr. Torricelli said her speech "helps her and it helps those of us who want to help her rebuild the country."
Mrs. Chamorro ends her three-day state visit on Wednesday with a meeting with President Bush and the Cabinet and a formal White House dinner.

HEADLINE: Talk About Culture Shock: Ant People in Sky-High Huts

BYLINE: By TIM GOLDEN

 BODY:
Davi Kopenawa Yanomami had left his communal hut and traveled from his village deep in the Amazon rain forest to tell of the horrors that white men were visiting upon his people. Then he saw Times Square.
"Man has become crazy," Davi said, as he shuffled down Seventh Avenue in crinkly white running shoes, looking for what had been described to him as the heart of New York. For protection, he wore a necklace of macaw feathers and hollowed seeds beneath his blue work shirt. But his eyes still darted nervously to the blur of passing automobiles. 
 New Yorkers scurried by on the sidewalk, drafting his small, stocky frame to one side, then the other. "They are like the ant," he announced. "They start one way and turn around and go the other way. They look all the time at the ground and never see the sky. Why do they do that?"
In New York's annals of awe-struck visitors and cultural confrontations, Davi (who doesn't really have a last name, but borrows that of his tribe) begins a new chapter. Among the Yanomami of Brazil, part of the hemisphere's largest tribe of unacculturated Indians, he is the first to visit the United States.
 
Reluctant Traveler
 As a shaman-in-training, a village notable and the primary hunter-gatherer of his young family, Davi was not really eager to leave his home near the Demini River. He had been trying to find money for an emergency health project, planning the first Yanomami school and hoping to find time for some spiritual journeys. Also, he was worried about visiting a country so recently at war. Among the Yanomami, war is a messy business of axes and clubs and long, bamboo-tipped arrows; years ago, an American anthropologist labeled them "the fierce people," for their tendency to kill each other.
But Davi (pronounced dah-VEE) is one of few Yanomami who speak Portuguese, or any other foreign language, and there is much for them to tell. More than three years ago, gold prospectors began swarming into the forests that his people have occupied for millenia, polluting their rivers with mercury, scaring off their monkeys and tapir, and carrying in deadly diseases like malaria, tuberculosis and the common cold.
Davi is planning to explain all of this to the Secretaries General of the United Nations and the Organization of American States, to high officials of the World Bank and to anyone else who will listen. He was brought to the United States for two weeks by Indian-rights groups eager to dramatize the plight of the Yanomami.
Unlike most of his contemporaries, Davi, who has been saying for several years that he is about 35 years old, saw his first white man while still a boy. He has since visited Sao Paulo, and even London and Oslo, where he has made speeches, received awards and heard a lot about New York.
An American friend hoped to soften the shock of Manhattan by lending his Upper West Side apartment -- and stocking the refrigerator with bananas and Chiquita Caribbean Splash fruit juice. The friend would have rigged up a hammock, too, had the beams of his pre-war building held the screws.
Anyway, Davi arrived angry. In Rio de Janeiro, Pan American airline stewards insisted that he check the bow and arrows he had carried along as a gift. At Kennedy Airport, people wearing the same uniforms gave him back only a form, to report lost luggage.
As might have happened with any first-generation son of the earth, a note of condescension crept into Davi's voice as he rode down Broadway on the 104 bus.
"Everything in the world here, everything in these countries is mixed up," he said in his rough Portuguese, glancing out at 72d Street. "Nothing is separated. All the races are mixed. They don't have blood of their own."
Even dogs.
"Another race of dogs in New York," Davi said, admiring a Pekinese whose hair, he figured, would substitute wonderfully for the feathers used to decorate the headdresses that the Yanomami call cocar. A poodle minced by, tied to a man by a long rope. "They have other hair, the dogs; other customs."
The customs of the people seemed no less strange.
"That man is coming from the laundromat," Davi's traveling companion, Claudia Andujar, explained, referring to a man with plastic bags of clothing slung over his shoulder. The party was walking back along 106th Street after a look at the Hudson. "People here don't wash their clothes," she said.
"But the river is right there!" Davi protested.
He was kidding.
 
Spiritual Questions
 At the Cathedral Church of St. John the Divine, though, Davi was vexed by the marble sarcophagus holding the remains of a bishop. When the Yanomami die, their bodies are cremated and their ashes consumed in a grog of plantain mush. The names of the dead are never spoken again, making it hard to determine just how many have been killed by the miners and their diseases.
"If his body is in there," Davi asked, "where does his soul go?"
It is not that the Yanomami have no explanation for the ways of white men. A Yanomami myth holds that whites came into the world long ago, when a fight among men interrupted the ritual seclusion of an Indian girl during her first menses. The forest was plunged into darkness and a flood swept many Yanomami away. Remori, a supernatural being, skimmed up some of the foam and mumbled into his cupped hands. The bits of foam then became white people, who, to the Yanomami way of thinking, still use the same burbling noises to communicate.
 
Where King Kong Clung
 In the souvenir shop of the Empire State Building, Davi wondered about the monkey depicted on all of the coffee cups and key rings.
A friend explained that the items referred to an old movie about a giant ape that terrorized New York. The friend pointed to posters of King Kong hugging the skyscraper's top.
"Does the monkey still exist?" Davi wanted to know.
It is not the Yanomami way to be impressed by new things, and on leaving the building Davi seemed nonchalant.
"I have been higher than that before," he confided in a taxi cab that squirted down Fifth Avenue. "The homes of the shabori," he said, using the Yanomami word for shaman, "are much higher."
In the Surucucus range of northern Brazil, where many Yanomami live (the roughly 20,000 members of the tribe are divided about equally by the Brazilian-Venezuelan border), the hills rise to more than 3,000 feet. But Davi was really talking about something else, said Ms. Andujar, who is trying to have the Brazilian Government declare Yanomami lands a national park.
"Nothing ever surprises him because he has already experienced everything in his spiritual trips," she said, meaning the journeys that Yanomami make with the help of yakoana, a hallucinogenic that is blown into the nostrils through long tubes.
By the next afternoon, at the Museum of the American Indian, Davi had become positively didactic. At one display case, he pointed to the small likeness of a shaggy quadruped.
"That," he said, "is the buffalo."
His companions stared in disbelief. Where could he have seen a buffalo?
"In Sao Paulo," he explained. "I saw that movie, 'The Dance of the Wolf.' "
In coming to the United States, the hope of raising money for sick Yanomami was foremost in Davi's mind. The Brazilian Government that took office last year promised to evict the estimated 45,000 prospectors on Yanomami lands and even dynamited their airstrips. But some of the miners have already returned, and their diseases continue to kill Indians who have no immunity, even to common colds.
 
In the South Bronx
 As he was driven through poorer parts of New York on Saturday afternoon, Davi began to question the salubriousness of things here.
"When I see white men like that," he said of a ragged-looking man walking along Southern Boulevard in the South Bronx, "I feel very sad. He has no food. He has no place of his own."
Davi felt better when he looked down from his airplane at the green surroundings of Washington, Ms. Andujar said. Then the people in Pan American uniforms at National Airport told him that they had lost his luggage again.

HEADLINE: Darman Forecasts Dire Health Costs

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 16

 BODY:
President Bush's budget director, Richard G. Darman, delivered a dire warning today about increases in the cost of health care, telling Congress that annual Government spending on Medicare and Medicaid would exceed Social Security outlays by the turn of the century.
The Government expects to spend $156 billion on the two health programs in this fiscal year, as against $269 billion for Social Security. Public and private health spending in the United States now exceeds $600 billion a year, or about $1.7 billion a day. 
 "Total health spending has grown from less than 6 percent of the gross national product three decades ago to about 12 percent today," Mr. Darman said at a hearing of the Senate Finance Committee. "It is currently projected to reach 17 percent by the year 2000 and 37 percent of G.N.P. by 2030."
Mr. Darman did not say how he had computed those estimates. He did say that the country would probably not let current trends continue to the point that health care accounted for more than one-third of the gross national product, the nation's total output of goods and services.
 
Spending More Than Profits
 Mr. Darman said business spending on health insurance premiums and health care for employees and former employees had increased so much that, in 1989, it was "in excess of 100 percent of after-tax profits" of all American companies, taken together.
Health care is usually treated as a cost of doing business. Under current law, employers who pay health insurance premiums for employees may deduct the payments as a business expense on their tax returns.
The hearing did not focus on any specific legislative proposal, but, as with similar hearings being held this month by the House Ways and Means Committee, it reflected Congress's seemingly insatiable appetite for information about health care.
Business executives told the Finance Committee today that urgent action was needed to help control health care costs. Kenneth A. Macke, chairman and chief executive officer of the Dayton Hudson Corporation, said his company's medical expenses rose to $115 million last year from $60 million in 1985.
 
Big Problems for Big Steel
 Walter F. Williams, chairman and chief executive officer of the Bethlehem Steel Corporation, said health costs for the steel industry had more than doubled in the last decade and now accounted for more than 15 percent of total employment costs. Health care costs seriously threaten the competitiveness of this country's steel industry because they are two to three times as high as for steel industries in other countries, he said.
As if to underline the problem, Federal researchers reported today that health spending accounted for a far bigger share of the gross national product in the United States than in other countries.
George J. Schieber, research director of the Health Care Financing Administration, the Federal agency that runs the Government health insurance plans for the elderly and for the poor, said he had found that no other Western industrialized country spent more than 9 percent of its gross national product on health care. Moreover, he said, the proportion of G.N.P. spent on health has actually declined in some countries commonly thought to have more comprehensive national health care programs.
Mr. Schieber's findings were reported in Health Affairs, a quarterly journal published by Project Hope, a private health foundation.
He said that spending on health care averaged $2,354 for each person in the United States in 1989. That was 40 percent higher than the comparable figure in Canada and twice the average for the 24 industrial countries in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.
In his projections of health spending, Mr. Darman assumed that Medicaid outlays would grow 12.7 percent a year, as they did from 1985 to 1990. That assumption seems implausible but not impossible, health economists say.
Mr. Darman objected to suggestions that the United States put some type of overall limit on national health spending. Such a limit would lead inevitably to the rationing of health care, he said.
But Senator Thomas A. Daschle, Democrat of South Dakota, said health care was already being rationed, on the basis of people's ability to pay.
The political difficulty of restraining health care costs was dramatized today as House Democrats denounced President Bush for proposing cutbacks in Medicare. Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, the House majority leader, said the proposals "would place the quality of medical care for senior citizens at risk."

HEADLINE: Ruling Removes Last Hurdle For 6 Real-Estate Projects

BYLINE: By RONALD SULLIVAN

 BODY:
The last legal obstacle to the construction of six major real-estate projects, including several apartment and office buildings on the West Side, was removed yesterday when a state appeals court restored two New York City zoning law amendments.
The amendments, which had been struck down by a lower court, cleared the way for Manhattan West, a complex of 1,000 apartments on West End Avenue between 61st and 64th Streets; a 51-story office building at Ninth Avenue and 31st Street; a hotel near the Convention Center; a major expansion of the United Parcel Service distribution center in Tribeca, and a small part of Metrotech, a development in downtown Brooklyn. 
 "I'm gratified by the ruling," said Victor A. Kovner, the City Corporation Counsel. "It will now permit some much needed development without sacrificing any enviromental interests."
Richard L. Schaffer, chairman of the City Planning Commission, said: "This is an important victory for effective planning. It will enable the commission to focus on real enviromental concerns rather than speculative ones."
 
'Environmental Consequences'
 The ruling was said to have little impact on Donald J. Trump's proposed development project, Riverside South, between West End Avenue and the Hudson River largely because it has not yet begun the formal city-review procedure.
The ruling overturned a decision by Justice Ira Gammerman of State Supreme Court, who ruled in November that the Board of Estimate "failed to take the requisite hard look" when it approved two zoning changes that would allow the projects to be built.
Justice Gammerman, in siding with a coalition of environmentalists and West Side opponents of the projects, said that in approving the zoning changes the city failed to accurately assess the future "enviromental consequences" that large-scale building would have on West Side residents.
The city "chose not to see what was there to be seen," the judge said.
But in a unanimous decision yesterday, the Appellate Division of State Supreme Court overruled Justice Gammerman. In an opinion written by Justice Theodore R. Kupferman, the court concluded that the board, which has since been abolished under the new City Charter, had studied the enviromental impact of the zoning changes and had given them "the requisite hard look throughout the review process."
"It cannot be said that the Board of Estimate's determination was affected by an error of law or was arbitrary and capricious or an abuse of its discretion," the court said."
"What the court ruling means," said Leonard J. Koerner, an Assistant Corporation Counsel, "is that all these projects can now go ahead, there are no more legal impediments."
At issue were two changes in the zoning law that the board approved on Feb 22, 1990. The first incorporated a series of enviromental safeguards concerning large-scale commercial, manufacturing and mixed-used development in congested areas of the city.
The second dealt with development within or over railroad or subway lines.
Opponents of the changes, like People for Westpride and several other enviromental groups including the Natural Resources Defense Council, said they relaxed environmental standards and allowed larger construction than was appropriate.

HEADLINE: Dow Soars 53.71 to Reach Its High for Year

BYLINE: By H. J. MAIDENBERG

 BODY:
Strong buying that intensified in the afternoon lifted all sectors of the stock market in heavy trading yesterday. At the close, the Dow Jones industrial average was at a high for 1991 and less than 13 points away from its record, while most other popular share indexes were at highs.
The 30-share Dow average closed up 53.71, at 2,986.88, passing its 1991 high of 2,973.27, set March 6. The Dow's peak of 2,999.75 was reached last July 16 and 17. 
 "The strength of the Dow tells us that investors are once again interested in the basic industrial issues, such as the metals, papers, chemicals and other sectors that were thought of as vulnerable during a recession," said Michael Metz, chief market strategist at Oppenheimer & Company.
What kept many investors away from the basic industrials and blue chips until now, Mr. Metz said, was a hesitation to act until first-quarter corporate earnings and other potentially negative news were out. Prices backed and filled early in the session yesterday, but "after a nervous start, the market apparently decided the bad news was out and that it was time to look ahead," he said.
Many institutional investors did not need much persuasion once the rally began after midday, when the Dow average stood at about 2,930. For months, portfolio managers for pension and mutual funds, insurance companies, bank trusts and other institutions have watched the yields on Treasury bonds and other fixed-income securities shrivel.
As the buying turned into a near frenzy in the last hour of trading, some of the last of the institutional fence-sitters joined the rally. At the final bell, the New York Stock Exchange composite index had set a record for the second day, closing up 3.12, at 211.71, and Big Board volume had soared to 214.5 million shares, from 161.8 million the day before.
Among the Big Board issues that benefited from the new-found support were those that had been placed under a cloud because of poor earnings or poor prospects. I.B.M., for example, was up 2 3/8, to 109 1/4. Citicorp, which reported a plunge in earnings yesterday, nevertheless, saw its stock rise 3/8, to 16 3/8.
RJR Nabisco led the list, gaining 1/8, to 12 1/4, on a volume of eight million shares, after a positive response to a note offering, and American Telephone was the second-most-active issue, rising 1 3/8, to 37 1/4, on a turnover of 3.4 million shares. There were hints that A.T.& T. might raise its bid for NCR.
Bank shares, which had been out of favor for a long time, were in demand, because their latest earnings reports were not so depressed as expected. For example, Wells Fargo jumped 7 1/2, to 80, because its earnings declined only 5 percent and it had no new significant loan problems. BankAmerica rose 1 5/8, to 39, in sympathy. Security Pacific said it did not expect to cut its dividend more than the 40 percent reduction announced last month and its shares climbed 1 7/8, to 26 1/4. Corestates Financial reported lower earnings that were still well above expectations and its stock rose 2 5/8, to 39 1/8.
In all, 1,126 Big Board issues advanced and 514 declined. Analysts said many a computer had signaled "buy" when the Dow passed 2,950.
But far more buy orders were set off when the Standard & Poor's 500 index, which most professional portfolio managers follow, finally settled over 380 in the last hour after meandering in a relatively narrow range for most of the session. The S.& P. 500 ended up 6.43, at 387.62, eclipsing the previous record set the day before.

Tokyo Stock Higher
 TOKYO, Wednesday, April 17 (Reuters) -- Tokyo stocks closed higher in trading today. The Nikkei average gained 167.07 points, or 0.62 percent, to 26,980.37.

HEADLINE: Wine Talk

BYLINE: By Frank J. Prial

 BODY:
"DINERS zero in on names." So said a restaurateur in Seattle, in response to the second annual poll on wine-drinking habits in restaurants compiled by Wine and Spirits magazine. The restaurateur, Lotta Hashizume, could have added: "and white wine." She did note that at her place, Chez Shea, the producer most often mentioned was Sonoma-Cutrer, a Windsor, Calif., winery that makes only chardonnay.
Consciously or not, Ms. Hashizume put her finger on something fundamental: consumers go for good-quality wines that are well-marketed and, most important, available. In other words, popular brand names. 
 Many consumers have never read a tasting note, no matter how precious or baroque. Many have never read a wine column, newsletter or magazine. They recognize a name from previous restaurant forays, probably recommended by a sommelier or captain, and they feel comfortable ordering it.
The five names mentioned most by guests in the 122 restaurants responding to the poll were, in order: Robert Mondavi Winery, in Napa Valley; Sonoma-Cutrer Vineyards , in northern Sonoma; Jordan Winery , in Alexander Valley; Kendall-Jackson Vineyards in Lake County, and Clos du Bois Winery , in Healdsburg. Each of them makes fine wine, each markets aggressively and each one's wines are widely distributed. And, it goes without saying, they are all in California. The best any foreign wine company could do was Louis Jadot, in Burgundy, France, in eighth place.
This year, Wine and Spirits sent questionnaires to 750 restaurants, including the 40 most popular restaurants in each of the 16 markets where the Zagat restaurant guides are compiled and the most popular hotel restaurants in the Zagat hotel surveys. One hundred twenty-two restaurants responded.
Respondents were asked for a list of the 10 top-selling wines in the last quarter of 1990, as well as their top-selling after-dinner drinks, and for some answers to questions about how customers order and what they see in the future. In last year's poll, in which 100 restaurants responded, Sonoma-Cutrer was first, Mondavi second and Jordan third. Grgich Hills Cellar and Trefethen Vineyards , both in Napa Valley, were fourth and fifth.
Of the restaurants responding, 39 said they were American, 38 French, 21 Italian, and 5 Spanish. The 19 others included Chinese and seafood.
Chardonnay continued to outsell all other wines, the poll found. The top five chardonnays were Sonoma-Cutrer, Kendall-Jackson, Robert Mondavi, Trefethen and Edna Valley Vineyards in San Luis Obispo County. Grgich Hills, ranked third last year, dropped into sixth place.
When it comes to French wine in restaurants, the favorite wine is Pouilly-Fuisse, followed at a considerable distance by Meursault and Chassagne-Montrachet, both quite expensive wines these days. The Macon whites, which represent good value in restaurants and retail shops these days, could do no better than fourth.
Again, name brands predominated; in this case, Jadot, Louis Latour and Joseph Drouhin, all exporters of considerable standing in this country and with good distribution. What is not clear about the French wines is whether patrons asked for the type of wine -- Beaujolais, for example -- and took whatever brand was offered, or whether they specified the brand name.
 Counting both red and white wines, the top French label was Jadot, with Louis Latour, Joseph Drouhin, Georges DuBoeuf and Guigal following in that order. Not one of them, incidentally, is from Bordeaux. Last year, the top five were Jadot, Drouhin, Latour, DuBoeuf and Chateau de Meursault .
Jordan was the most popular cabernet sauvignon by a wide margin. Wine and Spirits asked each restaurant to rank their top-selling wines from 1 to 10, with the best seller getting 10 points. Thus Jordan amassed 139 points to second-placed Silver Oaks Cellars ' 59 points. Mondavi was third, Beaulieu Vineyard was fourth and Chateau Montelena was fifth. Every one of these wineries except Jordan is in Napa Valley.
For some reason, Wine and Spiritscalled pinot noir "perhaps the most dynamic varietal" in the poll. In fact, the ratings were very low, indicating that the wine may be the darling of the wine buffs, but that it still has a long way to go to make its mark among the restaurant crowd. The top pinot noir, and one of only a handful of American wines from some place other than California, was from Knudsen-Erath , in the Willamette Valley of Oregon.
Calera , which is an exception to the stipulation that these wines be widely distributed, was No. 2. But it qualifies on both other counts: its single vineyard pinot noirs are widely viewed as among the very best made anywhere, and are certainly among the best promoted. Louis Jadot, in Burgundy, was third; La Crema , in Sonoma County was fourth and Rex Hill Vineyards , in Newberg, Ore., was fifth.
The number of restaurants listing French wines among the best sellers was fewer than one might think. The relative weakness of the dollar against the French franc had much to do with it, the poll takers concluded, as well as the fact that French restaurants are much less likely than others, particularly American, to offer wine by the glass.
Mr. DuBoeuf, who is billed as the King of Beaujolais, got far more points for his Pouilly-Fuisse than for his Beaujolais-Villages. For some reason, Americans love to snap the wine list shut with authority and announce, "We'll take the Pouilly-Fuisse."
The best-selling Italian label was Santa Margherita, apparently because its best-known wine is pinot grigio, an inoffensive and popular white wine. To dedicated Italian wine drinkers, this must come as a shock. To them, Italy is a land of superb red wines and an ocean of mostly forgettable whites. That is not the way the Saturday night restaurant crowd sees it. Of the 12 producers who made the list, 7 were there exclusively for white wines, and even famous old houses like Ruffino, Antinori and Frescobaldi scored a substantial number of points for their white wines.
The same is true for Spain: prominent producers of fine red wines, including Torres, Cune and the Marques de Riscal, scored more points for their whites.
Fewer sparkling wines made the list, reflecting the economic downturn. Moet & Chandon, from France, led, followed by its Napa Valley subsidiary, Domaine Chandon. Schramsberg, also in Napa Valley, was third. Charles Heidseick and Veuve Clicquot tied for fourth, Perrier-Jouet was fifth and expensive Krug was sixth. Last year the top three were Moet, Clicquot and Perrier-Jouet.
High prices in Champagne and the continuing weakness of the dollar certainly helped Domaine Chandon become one of the top five sparkling wines and helped Schramsberg move up.
Are there lessons in all this? Several. First, that restaurants continue to be showcases for good wine. Second, that the public rewards consistency in quality and availability. Third: where fine wine is concerned, brand recognition is here to stay.
 
TASTINGS
Guenoc Winery, 1985 Cabernet Sauvignon, Lake County, Calif.; about $9.
 Lake County is north of Napa and east of Mendocino and Sonoma. The Guenoc Winery is at the southern end of the county; so much so that some of its vineyards extend down into northern Napa, around the base of Mount St. Helena. The area differs from the northern part of the county in soil and temperature to the extent that it has its own appellation from the Federal Government: Guenoc Valley. Lillie Langtry, the British actress and demimondaine lived here for a time in the 1880's; her picture is on Guenoc labels. Lake County reds tend to be lush and rounded rather than tannic and structured. This 1985 could hardly be called lean and tight, but it has plenty of backbone to go with the fruit. Cassis is a preponderant flavor. A wine to
enjoy now at a most reasonable price. Guenoc also makes a delicious zinfandel.

HEADLINE: Fumbling New York's Fiscal Crisis

 BODY:
New York City is in a state of emergency, suffering from an economy in free fall. Sales and income tax revenues are below even pessimistic projections, the budget gap keeps growing and no relief is in sight. Yet there is scant evidence that City Hall is prepared to make the difficult decisions to lead the city out of danger.
Mayor David Dinkins has yet to provide clear, consistent leadership that could anticipate and limit damage. Instead the Mayor has reversed himself time and again, and now, faced with a newly discovered budget gap, City Hall is doing a very good impression of panicking. 
 Forced to close a new hole of more than $250 million in less than three months, the Mayor and his advisers are scurrying for solutions. They almost sound surprised, as if the economy hadn't been wreaking havoc for months.
Few anticipated the severity of the decline in tax revenues, but budget experts warned of the recession's destructive path months ago. Gov. Mario Cuomo has long sounded the alarm and called on the Mayor to go further. Had Mr. Dinkins taken more decisive steps early, the city might have weathered this latest onslaught without a crisis. But every time the Mayor showed signs of truly confronting the city's problems, he pulled back. He was trying, no doubt, to limit the pain. But that is only making things worse now.
After realizing that the city couldn't afford its imprudent settlement with the teachers' union, the Dinkins administration approved a similar contract with other unions, then agreed to a wage deferral that will ultimately cost the city dearly. The Mayor called for further concessions from labor but so far has gotten none. He pledged to consolidate agencies, but they are unchanged. He proposed sizable layoffs but averted all but about 1,000 of them through a wage deferral. Right now, the city work force is larger -- by about 1,600 people -- than it was on the day Mr. Dinkins took office.
This crisis is likely to get much worse. In the fiscal year beginning July 1, the deficit in a $29 billion budget could exceed $3 billion. Debt service is enormous, the needs of the poor are growing and the state cannot do much because of its own crisis.
If New York City is to get through the recession, it needs radical changes. The municipal work force, which accounts for half the budget, will have to shrink. If huge corporations have responded to the slide by consolidating, reducing salaries and dropping jobs, is that impossible for the city?
There are sound reasons, for example, to try to expand sanitation routes, merge some firehouses and take a more critical look at vacations, other fringe benefits, the Police Department and even the Mayor's police plan.
Standard assumptions won't get the city through this crisis, and more mayoral wavering will only make it worse. If Mr. Dinkins hopes to minimize future damage to the city, he has little choice but to redesign the government.

HEADLINE: In the Nation;
The Party of April 15?

BYLINE: By TOM WICKER

 BODY:
With millions of Americans having just trooped glumly to the post office to send in their annual tribute to the Government, why are Democrats hesitating to back Senator Daniel P. Moynihan's proposal to cut taxes for lower- and middle-income people while raising them on the affluent?
What step could Democrats take that would be more likely to counter charges that they are the party of "tax and tax and spend and spend," or Ronald Reagan's quip that Republicans are the party of July Fourth while Democrats are the party of April 15? 
 Senator Moynihan, the New York Democrat, has proposed again, as he did last year, that the Social Security payroll tax, the most onerous of Federal levies, be lowered from 6.2 to 5.2 percent by 1996, but that the maximum wages subject to the tax be increased in the same period from $53,400 to $82,000.
Sum up the political advantages for the Democrats:
* A tax cut for those of lower income, and in a highly regressive tax at that, since those earning hundreds of thousands a year now pay no more in Social Security taxes than someone earning only $53,400.
* A significant and partly compensating shift of the payroll tax's heavy burden to those better able to pay, by taxing up to $82,000 of their earnings.
* A clear Democratic initiative -- if the party signs on -- that would benefit those claimed as its constituency.
* An issue that probably would evoke the opposition of the Bush Administration and loyalist Republicans, thus blunting their tax-and-spend charges against Democrats.
Unfortunately for these prospects, Lloyd Bentsen and Dan Rostenkowski, the chairmen of the Senate and House committees that write tax legislation, and other conservative Democrats argue that the Moynihan proposal would endanger Social Security benefits.
It wouldn't, now or later. Apart from the compensating increase in wages subject to the payroll tax, the Social Security trust fund is amply sufficient to cover its obligations, and would remain so after the proposed changes. The Social Security Actuary Office reports, for example, that assets "from 55 percent to 110 percent of annual expenditures" would carry the fund safely through a 5-to-10-year period of economic downturn.
At the beginning of this year, assets were 83 percent of annual expenditures. Even after a 1 percent cut in the payroll tax, of course, and even during a lengthy recession, the trust fund would continue to receive enormous annual revenues.
It's also argued that the Moynihan plan would increase the Federal deficit. Baloney. The Social Security trust fund only masks the size of the actual deficit, since the Government borrows from it to pay general obligations -- something the trust fund was never intended for, and which represents a greater lack of fiscal responsibility than cutting an unfair tax.
The Congressional Budget Office huffs and puffs, too, that lowering the payroll tax would reduce gross national product perhaps 1 percent annually. An increase in the deficit, according to this reasoning, would cause savings to fall, interest rates to rise and investment to decline.
This tortured scenario seems hardly to take into account the stimulative effect of the increased buying power that the payroll tax cuts would give to millions of Americans. Nor does it reflect a concern for the widespread and plausible belief of so many low-to-middle-income taxpayers that they are heavily and unfairly taxed while the wealthy get off lightly.
Even if the C.B.O. were right -- economic forecasting, after all, is as fallible as any other kind -- it does not exactly predict doom; and the political considerations involved are at least as weighty as the economic. Two Republican Administrations, while compiling unmatched records for borrowing and spending over the last decade, have made a major and damaging issue of the Democrats' alleged taxing and spending proclivities. This not only tends to conceal the Republicans' own considerable fiscal irresponsibility; it has been a strong factor in the Democrats' long exclusion from national office.
Now Senator Moynihan offers his party a chance to refute the tax charge, expose Republican pretensions and give hard-pressed Americans a break. Why not grab it?

HEADLINE: A Few of the Reasons for Wanting to Flee New York City;
Most Want to Stay

 BODY:
To the Editor:
You sound the right alarm in your April 1 article on fears expressed by several economists about middle-class flight from New York City. 
 Municipal government must deliver services more cost-effectively. Otherwise, the very New Yorkers our city can least afford to lose will continue to leave town.
Rising taxes and declining quality of life are not inevitable, however.
Fiscal discipline and productivity in local government, an effective national urban coalition to obtain the rightful share of cities to Federal assistance and an economic upturn would shore up New York's appeal as a place to live and work.
Most New Yorkers want to stay; City Hall can help by holding the line on taxes and providing maximum service for every tax dollar. These policies would go a long way toward increasing confidence in New York's future.

HEADLINE: Homer Bigart, Acclaimed Reporter, Dies

BYLINE: By RICHARD SEVERO

 BODY:
Homer Bigart, one of the most accomplished reporters in American journalism, died yesterday at the Edgewood Center in Portsmouth, N.H., where he had been hospitalized for two months. Mr. Bigart, who wrote for both The New York Herald Tribune and The New York Times, was 83 years old and lived in West Nottingham, N.H.
He died of cancer, his wife, Else, said. 
 In a calling whose end product tends to be ephemeral and forgettable, in which writers nervously jest that they are only as good as their last story, Mr. Bigart stood as an enduring role model.
During a prize-collecting career of nearly four decades, he always seemed to be at the top of his game, much to the dismay of his competitors.
His articles remained taut, witty and astringently understated, even when created under deadline pressure and the appalling working conditions imposed by war and famine; even when they concerned mundane events that lesser reporters regarded as routine. Mr. Bigart knew that what counted was not the place but the poetry and that a reporter could create memorable prose from even the most unremarkable happening.
Such pieces became models of grace by which young reporters measured their own talent, and they were the reality from which a legend was born. In journalism schools and in the drafty city rooms of a town that always prided itself on being the ultimate stop for the nation's most gifted newspaper reporters, Mr. Bigart was regarded with awe.
He won most of the major national and local prizes in journalism. There was a Pulitzer Prize, and there was an uncommon second Pulitzer. There were an Overseas Press Club award and the George Polk Memorial Award and the Meyer Berger Award and a Page One Award, and many others.
All were given for the resourcefulness and courage that Mr. Bigart repeatedly showed in World War II, the Greek civil war, the Korean War and the turbulent years that followed, when he wrote about the civil-rights struggle and hunger and the extraordinary changes that were taking place in urban and rural America.
All of his articles were written either for The Herald Tribune, where he worked from 1929 to 1955, or The Times, where he worked from 1955 until his retirement in 1972.
If his reporter friends told him that the encomiums in his stocking approached an indecent level, they were proud that he had won such praise, because they felt he was the best of them. Wherever he went and whatever he did, his copy rose above the moment; no awards judge could resist Mr. Bigart at his best.
 
Describing History In the Making
 For example, there was the opening of the article he wrote from the battleship Missouri on Sept. 2, 1945, telling readers of The Herald Tribune that one of the greatest military struggles in world history was finally over:
"Japan, paying for her desperate throw of the dice at Pearl Harbor, passed from the ranks of the major powers at 9:05 A.M. today when Foreign Minister Mamoru Shigemitsu signed the document of unconditional surrender.
"If the memories of the bestialities of the Japanese prison camps were not so fresh in mind, one might have felt sorry for Shigemitsu as he hobbled on his wooden leg toward the green baize covered table where the papers lay waiting.
"He leaned heavily on his cane and had difficulty seating himself. The cane, which he rested against the table, dropped to the deck of this battleship as he signed."
And there was the time in 1943 that he took a troopship to London and was surprised that it had not been torpedoed, reports of scores of U-boats to the contrary. Three paragraphs from the end of his dispatch he wrote:
"Then you woke up one morning and the ship was very steady, and you knew she had entered the harbor. You had arrived. You had crossed the submarine-infested Atlantic without sighting even a porpoise. A hell of a thing to have to confess to your grandchildren."
War is damaging to the sense of humor of those who are caught up in it, but Mr. Bigart, describing the American Army's pursuit of the Germans in Sicily and noting that civilian conduct had been "exemplary," wrote this on July 25, 1943, as a last paragraph:
"In fact, the Sicilians are too friendly. Their attitude strengthens the impression that this island is a forgotten portion of Southern California, instead of a segment of enemy Italy."<nm But there were times when he had to describe death, as he did on Dec. 18, 1943, from San Pietro, Italy:
"Generally, there is no mistaking the dead -- their strange contorted posture leaves no room for doubt. But this soldier, his steel helmet tilted over his face, seemed merely resting in the field. We did not know until we came within a few steps and saw a gray hand hanging limply from a sleeve."
After he joined The Times, Mr. Bigart covered such important assignments as the trial of Adolf Eichmann, the Nazi war criminal, in Israel in 1961. The following year Mr. Bigart surveyed the war in Vietnam. He was already in his middle 50's, but he had lost none of his ability to understand a situation and report it quickly.
 
Shy, Private Man, Insouciant Wit
 David Halberstam, who succeeded Mr. Bigart for The Times, recalled that Mr. Bigart was one of the first reporters to conclude that contrary to the Pentagon's representations, America was not about to win an easy war, and that the war was in fact a tragedy and a mistake. He advised younger reporters to write that the American effort "just doesn't work."
Mr. Halberstam said Mr. Bigart's irreverence, his "unerring instincts," his willingness to challenge "the official version" and his leadership were the sustenance that younger reporters needed to chronicle an unprecedented American military tragedy.
In 1963, when The Times asked him to cover the grim winter confronting unemployed coal miners in Kentucky, it was clear that Mr. Bigart had lost none of his reportorial eye:
"Creeks are littered with garbage, choked with boulders and silt dislodged by strip-mine operations. Hillsides that should be a solid blaze of autumn color are slashed with ugly terraces, where bulldozers and steam shovels have stripped away the forest to get at the coal beneath."
The legend was not built simply on his articles. It rested as much on the man himself.
Mr. Bigart, a shy and private man with a pronounced stammer, was at once retiring and combative, devoted equally, it seemed, to minding his own business and to hoisting a few with friends. It was on these occasions that he told the stories the journalists of his era loved to tell and hear. And he did it as well in bars as in print. His insouciant one-liners about people, places and things were not soon forgotten by colleagues.
At The Herald Tribune, for example, one colleague (and rival) was Marguerite Higgins, a determined World War II and Korean War correspondent who won much fame because of the aggressive way she pursued reporting. Miss Higgins was a pioneer working in what men liked to think of as their province, and she often outmaneuvered most male rivals, who, in those prefeminist days, would have preferred her to be shy and confined to the society page, or, as they might have put it, barefoot and pregnant.
On one occasion, she did become pregnant. When Mr. Bigart learned of it, he snapped: "Oh, g-good. And wh-wh- who is the mother?" Later, when the baby was born, Mr. Bigart cheerily inquired if the mother had devoured it.
Another competitor in the old days was Clifton Daniel, a correspondent for The Times in Jerusalem in the late 1940's when Mr. Bigart covered Israel for The Herald Tribune. Years later Mr. Daniel, who eventually became managing editor of The Times, recalled how hard he had to work to avoid being scooped by Mr. Bigart.
"I worked out a system for keeping an eye on him," Mr. Daniel said. "I persuaded him to move into the Eden Hotel, where I lived after the King David was bombed by the Zionist underground. Moreover I had a car, and Homer didn't; I offered to give him a lift whenever there was a big story to be covered out of town, so I always knew where he was."
But the ploy didn't work. Britain then ran Palestine under a United Nations mandate, and Mr. Daniel said that Mr. Bigart "sneaked out of the press room of the British Office of Information and held a clandestine interview one night with one of the biggest underground leaders."
"I didn't know anything about it until the next day," Mr. Daniel said.
Later, after Mr. Bigart returned to New York, he would occasionally drink martinis at a grungy newspaper bar in the Times Square area where the customers could always see what they were breathing. Taking stock of the environment one night, Mr. Bigart politely inquired of the bartender what day of the week they changed the air.
One evening, late in life, he decided to tell Murray Illson, a reporter friend at The Times, that he was marrying again. "I showed her mine, and she showed me hers," Mr. Bigart said. Before Mr. Illson could say anything, Mr. Bigart added, "Our bankbooks."
Like other great reporters of his generation, Mr. Bigart never hesitated to show disdain for his editors and independence from them. One evening late in his career, he was assigned to write about a riot, drawing on information from reporters on the street.
As one reporter, John Kifner, called in from a phone booth, rioters began shaking it and Mr. Kifner conveyed his fright to Mr. Bigart. But Mr. Bigart, busy fending off editors he regarded as hysterical, comforted Mr. Kifner by noting, "At least you're dealing with sane people."
 
From Architecture To Journalism
 Homer William Bigart was born Oct. 25, 1907, in Hawley, Pa., in the Pocono region, the son of Homer S. Bigart, a woolens manufacturer, and Anna Schardt Bigart. He attended public schools there, then ventured to Pittsburgh to enroll in the Carnegie Institute of Technology. He thought he wanted to be an architect. The institute felt otherwise.
"They found I couldn't draw," Mr. Bigart later recalled, "and invited me to find another school."
In 1929, Mr. Bigart complied. He enrolled in the New York University School of Journalism and got a job as a night copy boy on The Herald Tribune. N.Y.U. liked him well enough, but Mr. Bigart remained unconvinced that his journalism professors knew much about journalism. He dropped out, and in 1929, as the Great Depression was starting, joined The Trib full time.
Since he was neither a college graduate nor adept at office politics, he remained a copy boy for four years. But then The Trib decided to give him a chance and made him a general-assignment reporter at $25 a week.
At first, it seemed he would not make it. He was a painfully slow writer. Editors were amazed at his bizarre typing style, in which he double-spaced between words. He made the errors that young reporters are prone to make. Once, assigned to cover the start of coach railroad service between New York and Florida, he went to the wrong track and wrote about the wrong railroad.
It was in this period that Mr. Bigart found he could use his halting speech to become a more effective reporter. The stammer made it easier for him to pose as a bumbler who was not very smart. He would often say to those he interviewed something like, "G-g-gee, I d-d-didn't really understand that. C-c-could you repeat it?"
Most of those he interviewed went to extra lengths to make sure he got the story straight, and the result was that Mr. Bigart's articles seemed to be clearer than anyone else's; the quotations were invariably rich.
During the 1930's the paper found ample reason to have more and more confidence in Mr. Bigart's skills, and in 1942 he was asked if he would become a war correspondent. He agreed and went on to cover the London blitz, the bombing of Nazi Germany, the battles of North Africa, Italy and southern France.
When the war was over in Europe, he moved to the Pacific and covered the final months of the war against Japan. He always seemed determined to cover war at the cannon's mouth and was one of the first reporters to enter Hiroshima after the Americans dropped the atomic bomb.
Newsweek called him "the hardest kind of worker and the fairest kind of competitor." Philip Potter of The Baltimore Sun said Mr. Bigart "worked over his copy more than any of the rest of us correspondents, who were anxious after a hard day in the field to get our copy written and filed so we could get a drink."
"Homer would still be at his portable, crossing off one word because he had thought of a better one," Mr. Potter said. "He observed things that we had missed."
The plaudits kept coming when he covered the war in Korea. In that war, Newsweek called him "the best war correspondent of an embattled generation."
The people who ran some of the countries Mr. Bigart visited as a reporter did not entirely agree with that appraisal. Because of the independence of his reporting, he was ordered out of Hungary, Egypt, Syria, Lebanon, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Oman and Vietnam.
The Vietnamese order was rescinded; the censor admitted he had made a translation error that led him to believe that Mr. Bigart had written something obscene.
When Mr. Bigart left The Trib to join The Times, there was no particular joy in it for him. The Trib was a decade away from its demise, and its economic problems were not lost on Mr. Bigart. But it was a paper with a proud tradition of giving writers their head, and Mr. Bigart loved it.
"It seemed to me that he always looked down on The Times, even when he worked there," Mr. Daniel said. "Its main fault, in his eyes, was that it wasn't The Trib. It was too proud and stiff-necked for his taste. But he knew that if he couldn't work for The Trib, the next best thing was The Times. He was not disloyal to it; he just wasn't in love with it."
Mr. Bigart's first two wives were Alice Veit, who died in 1959 after they were divorced, and Alice Weel, who died in 1969. The next year he married Else Holmelund Minarik, the author of children's books, who survives him. He is also survived by a sister, Margaret Crowe of Lancaster, Pa., and a stepdaughter, Brooke Minarik of Dover, N.H.
No funeral is planned, the family said.

HEADLINE: No Longer Just a Poor Fish, The Cod Is Doing Swimmingly

BYLINE: By DENA KLEIMAN

 BODY:
NO need anymore for blue blood. All it takes these days, it seems, is fancy new clothes and high-powered friends to get on the right guest lists.
That, anyway, is what happened to cod.
Codfish, once the stepchild of the kitchen but for years the seafood staple of school lunch lines and fast-food chains, has cracked the culinary Social Register: It is being served up these days at such food pedigree-conscious places as Le Cirque , Lutece , Montrachet, Z's in Cleveland and Jasper's in Boston. 
 "Cod is my favorite fish," said Anne Rosensweig, the chef at the Arcadia restaurant in New York.
Le Bernardin, the acclaimed French restaurant in New York, is now featuring three separate codfish entrees on its spring menu. One lavishes upon the once-scorned fish the food equivalent of diamonds: black caviar.
Around the country cod is appearing in better restaurants as chefs discover that it is a versatile, economical, eminently respectable alternative to higher-priced fishes like red snapper and tuna.
"No question these days; cod is quite the sung hero," said Mark May, the chef at La Colombe d'Or, a New York French restaurant that showers the fish with a sauce of sherry and balsamic vinegars, olive oil and pesto.
The ascension of cod is perhaps not unlike the recent debuts in gastronomic society of pasta, meatloaf and cassoulet. These and many other foods once considered peasant fare became chic overnight, as if waved over with a magic wand. In general their acceptance, chefs and industry analysts say, stems from a combination of factors -- low preparation costs, the attention of a handful of highly respected chefs and, of course, inherent quality.
"More and more chefs are realizing that there is no point using a $5-a-pound red snapper when they can use a $2-a-pound cod," said Richard Lord, a spokesman for the Fulton Fish Market, the largest fish market in the country. "They're saying, 'Let's have another look at this fish.' In fact, cod is a great fish and you don't have to spend two to three times the money."
Cod, a cold-water fish available fresh the year round, has been a staple in this country since before the American Revolution. It played such a large role in the state's economy to this day a carved cod hangs from the ceiling of the Massachusetts State House in Boston. And it is the namesake of the state's principal ocean peninsula.
With the invention in the 1950's of the frozen fish stick and the appearance in the 60's of deep-fried cod sandwiches in fast-food chains, cod became overfished, said A. D. Chandler, an analyst on seafood who is based in Rowley, Mass. Cod catches have steadily declined since then, Mr. Chandler said, and prices have steadily risen. In the last two years alone, the wholesale price of cod jumped to $2.50 per pound from $1.50.
Because of the price, some fast-food chains and lower-priced restaurants have been shifting to less expensive fish, like pollack. For example, Mrs. Paul's Fish Sticks, for years made exclusively with cod, now primarily rely on pollack, said a spokesman for the Campbell Soup Company, which makes the product. Industry analysts report that McDonald's and Long John Silver's are also looking for cod alternatives.
"We still think cod is a better fish," said Larry Gentile, vice president of Cedar River Seafood , a chain of 15 family-style seafood restaurants in Florida that serve fried cod dinners for about $9, including hush puppies, cole slaw and a choice of potato. "But with the rise in the price of cod, we've had to give smaller portions to keep our menu prices down."
On the other hand, for middle-range and higher-priced restaurants, cod is a bargain compared to swordfish and tuna, which can sell wholesale for as much as $7 a pound.
At Z Contemporary Cuisine , a California-style restaurant in Shaker Heights, Ohio, where the average dinner check is about $45, the chef, Zachary Bruel, introduced cod to his menu about a year ago. He had decided that he could not raise his prices, but he wanted to continue to use expensive olive oils and garnishes like caviar.
"You have to make it up somewhere," said Mr. Bruel, who charges $19.95 for his fish entrees. Rather than serve red snapper, which costs him about $5 per eight-ounce serving once it is trimmed, he now serves cod, which is about $3 per serving. Earlier this month, he featured a roasted cod dish with grilled fennel in a saffron broth served with garlic toast points and rouille.
Of course, those in the cod-fishing business have taken every opportunity to champion their fish.
The North Atlantic Seafood Association, a trade association based in Cleveland that represents Norwegian, Canadian, Icelandic and Danish fishing interests, exists almost exclusively to enhance the image of cod. Jim Wattenmaker, a spokesman for the association, said that as part of the the orgnization's effort to "upscale cod," he has aggressively promoted it to women's magazines and the chefs of fancy restaurants.
Clearly, his efforts have paid off.
Eberhard Mueller, the executive chef at Le Bernardin , says cod "is one of the most underrecognized species that swims around." Besides cod with caviar, he prepares cod in an herb crust with a rosemary vinaigrette as well as cod sauteed in a red wine sauce.
Bob Kinkead, chef and owner of Twenty-One Federal in Washington, applauds cod's versatility. He often serves it as a special in a crab-meat crust with brioche bread crumbs and a sauce of fish stock, clams, leeks and bacon.
"It is a great fish," says Andre Soltner of Lutece, where cod was served recently as a special in a red wine sauce with quenelles.
Jean Michel Diot, chef at the Park Bistro, a popular French bistro on Park Avenue South in Manhattan, has decided that cod is "the best fish in America." He serves it these days at dinner sauteed on a bed of mashed potatoes with fried leeks.
The key, of course, is buying the fish fresh and making sure it has been well maintained, has a firm texture, looks shiny and is yellowish-white. And it should not smell fishy. If it's bought pre-packaged in a supermarket, it should not be sitting in liquid. Since cod worm, a parasite, is not uncommon, cod should not be eaten raw unless it has been frozen for at least five days, said Mr. Lord at the Fulton Fish Market.
David Dorian, who manages the Amagansett Fish Company, a new fish market and restaurant in Amagansett, L.I., said in an interview that cod lent itself to a wide variety of preparations, including baking, sauteing and broiling. He advises customers who like to grill their fish to place it first on a piece of aluminum foil and sprinkle it with white wine, butter, fresh herbs and tomatoes.
"Swordfish and tuna of course are extraordinary fish," said Mr. Dorian, who sells them at his market for more than $13 a pound, "but because cod's only $6.99 a pound it lends itself to being enjoyed more often. And once people give it try, they'll see just how terrific it is. The only reason cod has had a bad rap all these years is that until now it has been thought of as common."
 
Same Fish, Many Roles
 
Cod and Mashed Potatoes (Adapted From Park Bistro)
Total time: 1 hour, 10 minutes
 
For the potatoes:
 
6 medium-size potatoes, scrubbed
4 tablespoons butter
 1/4 cup milk
 1/2 teaspoon salt
 1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
2 tablespoons minced chives
 
For the sauce:
 
3 tablespoons olive oil
1 large onion, peeled, cut in half lengthwise and sliced thin
3 garlic cloves, minced
2 ripe tomatoes, peeled and diced
4 cups dry white wine
2 cups chicken broth
1 bouquet garni (1 sprig thyme, 1 sprig parsley, 2 bay leaves, tied together)
 
For the leeks (optional):
 
1 pound leeks, green part and roots discarded
1 quart peanut oil
 
For the cod:
 
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 tablespoon butter
4 8-ounce cod fillets
 1/2 teaspoon salt
 1/4 teaspoon freshly ground pepper.
1. To prepare the potatoes, place them in a large heavy pot and cover with cold water. Bring to a boil, then reduce to a simmer and cook, uncovered, until tender, about 30 minutes. Remove with a slotted spoon, peel potatoes and mash in a bowl with butter, milk, salt, pepper and chives. Cover with foil and keep warm in a low oven.
2. Prepare the sauce. In a saucepan warm the olive oil over medium-low heat. Add onion and saute until onion caramelizes, turning light golden, about 15 minutes. Add garlic and tomatoes and saute until liquid evaporates, about 5 minutes. Add wine and cook until sauce reduces by half. Add chicken broth and bouquet garni, then simmer on low heat uncovered for 20 minutes, or until sauce is thick. Cover and remove from heat.
3. If desired, cut leeks in half lengthwise, then halve again into quarters. Wash with cold water and dry completely. Heat peanut oil in a large heavy pot or straight-sided saucepan until the oil registers 275 on a deep-fry thermometer (the oil should not be so hot that it is close to smoking). Fry leeks a few at a time, until golden brown, about 5 minutes a batch. Remove with slotted spoon to drain on paper towels or paper bags.
4. To cook fish, heat the olive oil and butter in a saucepan, preferably nonstick, over medium. Season fish with salt and pepper and fry 3 minutes a side, turning once. Remove from heat.
5. Reheat sauce over medium heat until hot. Remove bouquet garni. To serve, mound mashed potatoes on platter, top with fish fillets, sauce and leeks.
Yield: 4 servings.
 
Roast Cod
With Black Bean Sauce (Adapted From Tropica)
Total time: 40 minutes
 
For the sauce:
 
1 teaspoon vegetable oil
2 shallots, chopped fine
1 1/2 cloves garlic, mashed
1 tablespoon (heaping) Chinese fermented black beans
1 cup sake
2 tablespoons soy sauce
2 teaspoons rice vinegar
8 tablespoons butter
Freshly ground white pepper to taste
 
For the cod:
 
1 1/2 pounds cod fillets, cut into 4 portions
 1/4 teaspoon salt
 1/4 teaspoon freshly ground white pepper
1 tablespoon butter
 1/4 cup dry white wine or 1/4 cup water mixed with 1 tablespoon lemon juice.
1. Preheat oven to 400 degrees.
2. Prepare the sauce. In a saucepan warm the oil over medium heat. Add shallots, garlic and black beans and saute until shallots soften, about 3 minutes. Add sake, soy sauce and rice vinegar. Cook until sauce reduces by a third, then remove from heat and whisk in butter. Season with pepper.
3. To prepare the fish, season it with salt and pepper, and place in a small baking pan. Top with butter and pour wine over. Cover with aluminum foil and bake 8 minutes. Remove foil and bake 6 minutes more, or until cod flakes easily.
4. Reheat sauce until hot. Serve cod over couscous, top with sauce and garnish with fried onions and chives.
Yield: 4 servings.
 
Cod Papillote (Adapted from Amagansett Fish Company)
Total time: 50 minutes
 
4 6-ounce cod fillets
4 sheets parchment paper or foil
1 medium-size yellow onion, sliced thin
1 tablespoon plus 4 teaspoons butter
2 tablespoons olive oil
Salt and freshly ground pepper to taste
4 teaspoons honey
4 tablespoons Madeira
4 cups, lightly packed, salad greens (like red leaf and bibb lettuce, arugula, radicchio, endive, mache)
Juice of 1 lemon
4 littleneck clams
4 sprigs thyme.
1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees or prepare a grill.
2. Check cod and remove any remaining bones.
3. Fold parchment sheets in half. Cut out half-heart shape so that when the sheet is opened there will be a full heart shape, at least 16 inches wide at its widest point.
4. Over medium heat, cook onion in 1 tablespoon of butter and the olive oil, until golden brown, 12 to 15 minutes. Stir regularly. Add salt and pepper.
5. When onion is cooked, stir in honey and Madeira. Cook for 1 to 2 minutes. Remove from heat.
6. Starting with a fully opened heart shape, place 1 cup of salad greens on one side of the parchment, near the center fold line. On top of the greens add 1 cod fillet, 1 teaspoon butter, one quarter of the cooked onion mixture, one quarter of the lemon juice and 1/4 teaspoon salt and a pinch of pepper. Then place one clam alongside the fillet. (During cooking the clam will open. Its juices become part of the sauce, helping to steam the fish.) Garnish with a sprig of fresh thyme. Repeat to assemble the remaining three papillotes.
7. Fold the other side of the parchment paper over the ingredients. And, starting at the fold at the top of the heart, fold the two edges over several times to seal the papillote. (This seam should be on top of the papillote.) Continue this around the entire papillote until you reach the fold at the bottom of the heart. Tuck the very end underneath the papillote to form a tight seal. If grilling, assemble ingredients in center of a double layer of foil. Fold widthwise, crimping edges lightly, then roll and crimp lengthwise.
8. Bake for 12 to 15 minutes, or grill 10 minutes.
Yield: 4 servings.

HEADLINE: Woman in Florida Rape Inquiry Fought Adversity and Sought Acceptance

BYLINE: By FOX BUTTERFIELD with MARY B. W. TABOR

DATELINE: PALM BEACH, Fla., April 16

 BODY:
The woman who has accused William Kennedy Smith of raping her at the Kennedy estate here was born into a modest working-class family outside Akron, Ohio, but moved sharply up the economic scale 10 years ago after her divorced mother married a wealthy industrialist.
Since then, the young woman, Patricia Bowman, moved from Ohio to Florida, where she held jobs sporadically, took college classes occasionally, had a child and moved into a house near Palm Beach that was bought for her by her stepfather, Michael G. O'Neil, the former chairman of the General Tire and Rubber Company. 
 It was in Palm Beach more than two weeks ago, at a chic bar Ms. Bowman frequents, that she met Senator Edward M. Kennedy, his son Patrick and Mr. Smith. After returning with them to the Kennedy estate in the early hours of March 30, she later told the police, she was attacked.
 
No Comment on the Case
 Mr. O'Neil and Ms. Bowman have declined to discuss the case, and her lawyers did not respond to messages seeking comment today.
The major family changes Ms. Bowman would experience began in 1974. Court records show that her father, Robert Bowman, was a welder at White Motor Company, a truck manufacturer, and that her mother, Jean, was a secretary making less than $200 a week at the time she sued for divorce in 1974. Mrs. Bowman asserted that her husband was physically threatening her.
Mrs. Bowman soon became involved with Mr. O'Neil, whose wealth was listed at $10.3 million when he was divorced in 1981, according to documents filed in the proceedings. Mrs. Bowman was described as the "longstanding girlfriend" in a memorandum submitted by the industrialist's estranged wife and was subpoenaed to testify in the case.
Soon after the divorce the two were married, and Patricia Bowman's new stepfather helped her to make a transition from being an Ohio high school student with below-average grades to a young woman with a leisurely life in South Florida.
In 1989, after she gave birth to a daughter by a local man she did not marry, her stepfather bought for her a new contemporary three-bedroom house with pale peach walls at a cost of $161,800, according to the deed. The house, in Jupiter, 20 miles north of Palm Beach, is not far from the Loxahatchee Club, an exclusive walled community built around a lush, palm-lined golf course and small lakes, where her mother and stepfather live. A uniformed guard at a gatehouse screens all visitors.
After Ms. Bowman, 29 years old, said she had been raped, her stepfather was furious, people who have talked with him said. A blunt-spoken man, he is used to getting his own way, friends say.
"This is not about money," he told a reporter. "This is about justice."
And so he quickly hired two prominent criminal defense lawyers to support his step-daughter.
The case has thus pitted a successful industrialist, Mr. O'Neil, against a wealthy and powerful family.
 
'A Little Wild Streak'
 Ms. Bowman was born on Aug. 11, 1961, in Akron and was an only child. She was 13 when her parents were divorced. Afterward, she and her mother lived in a series of small houses and apartments in the Akron area.
She had a poor academic record at Tallmadge High School, said a school official who spoke on the condition he not be identified. But she was popular socially and "had a little wild streak," said a woman who knew her at the time. That meant that she and her friends liked to drive fast cars, go to parties and skip classes, the friend said.
But in the 10th grade she had to withdraw from school after a serious automobile accident in which she broke her neck, a school official said. She was a passenger in the car.
At the time, a doctor told her she would never walk again, a friend recalled. But three weeks later she walked out of the hospital.
Nevertheless, she had to wear a body brace and she struggled with constant pain caused by arthritis from the accident. This made her self-conscious, but also led her to be "very strong willed, very upbeat" as she tried to overcome the effects of the injury, the friend said. "I think she was more concerned about being accepted by her peers" than with getting good grades, he said.
After a year of treatment, Ms. Bowman, who liked to cook and listen to Bruce Springsteen music, returned to high school in nearby Stow. Then, after graduating, she attended classes at a college in Ohio and talked of becoming an architect, the friend said. But she also talked of moving to Florida to relieve the arthritic pain. "It was hell on her in the wintertime," the friend said.
In 1981, two years after finishing high school, Ms. Bowman did move to Florida.
Even today Ms. Bowman must still take medication to relieve the pain, the friend said, and he added that he had never seen her run. The doctors told her her neck was like glass -- "it's fine crystal," the friend said.
"This wildness you have heard about, it wasn't the same kind of wildness as other people," he said. "She knew her time clock was much more fragile than yours or mine."
During Ms. Bowman's high school years, her mother gradually rose through the ranks at the McNeil Corporation, a manufacturer of machinery for the tire companies of Akron, moving up from secretary, to executive secretary to the president of the company and then to secretary of the corporation. That made her the only female executive of the company. The chairman of one of her company's largest customers, General Tire, was the man she became involved with and eventually married.
A spokesman for the company where she worked, Raymond Keller, remembered her as "a very competent lady. She was a very highly thought of person."
After Ms. Bowman moved to Florida, where her stepfather liked to play golf, she worked briefly at a law firm, a church and at Walt Disney World.
From 1981 to 1990 she also enrolled in a number of liberal arts courses at Palm Beach Community College, though she never received a degree, according to the registrar's office. In addition, while she lived for a time outside Orlando in central Florida in the mid-1980's, she took English classes at the Hamilton Holt School, the continuing education division of Rollins College, a school official said.
But she was still drawn to the Palm Beach area, and in 1989 she had a brief affair with Johnny Butler, the son of a once-prosperous family here that owned a lumber company. The company has since declared bankruptcy.
Mr. Butler was the father of her child, friends say. It is unclear why the couple did not marry.
Although Ms. Bowman is known and introduced around Palm Beach as Patricia O'Neil, her driver's license lists her as Patricia Bowman. Records of the Florida Department of Highway Safety show that she received 17 tickets for speeding, careless driving or being involved in an accident between 1982 and 1990. In several cases she was driving more than 70 miles an hour in a 55-mile-an-hour zone.
In 10 cases, her license was suspended for her failure to pay the fines assessed for these violations. In one instance her license was suspended, from August 1986 until September 1987, after she was found to be driving without a proper license and for her failure to appear in court. Over the last three years she has been driving a black Mazda sports coupe.
During the 1980's the woman also frequented Palm Beach's expensive bars and nightclubs. "She was always having lots of fun out there on the scene," said Dick Hurley, a former bartender at the 264 bar and now a bartender at the Safari and Polo Club. The Safari and Polo Club sometimes features a black doorman in full African tribal regalia, complete with a headress and a spear.
Another acquaintance, Nathaniel Read, a construction contractor from West Palm Beach who frequents some of the same nightclubs as Ms. Bowman, said, "She liked to drink and have fun with the ne'er-do-wells in cafe society." Mr. Read was at this year's most chic watering hole, Au Bar, on the night Ms. Bowman met Mr. Smith there.
At La Trattoria di Capri, an Italian eatery with primitive murals of peasants on the wall, she struck up an acquaintance with the chef, Enrico Pontirole. One evening a few weeks before the incident at the Kennedy estate, Mr. Pontirole recalled, she came in at midnight after the kitchen was closed and she complained about being hungry.
So Mr. Pontirole went back to his pots and sauces and fixed his speciality, rigatone a la vodka, for her. Later he escorted her to a nearby bar, E. R. Bradley's, but was disappointed when she fell into conversation with several other men, according to Mr. Pontirole.
 
Just 'Hanging Out'
 Holly Montgomery, another local resident who was at the nightclub Au Bar on the night that Ms. Bowman met Mr. Smith, recalled that she "was just kind of hanging out." Ms. Montgomery said that she saw Ms. Bowman at the Kennedys' table and that she was not surprised when Ms. Bowman left with Mr. Smith. "How many times a night does that happen in Palm Beach?" she observed.
Ms. Bowman is believed to be staying at the O'Neil house inside the guarded development.
Her own house in Jupiter appears empty, with the blinds drawn, except in her daughter's room. There, on a shelf, are children's books, including a copy of "Babar's Anniversary Album" and "Two Minute Bible Stories."
 No such challenge was intended, and The Times regrets that some parts of the article reinforced such inferences.
The article should have explicitly asserted that nothing in the woman's known background could resolve the disputed testimony about her encounter with Mr. Smith. The Times regrets its failure to include such a clear statement of the article's limits and intent.
It remains The Times's practice to guard the identities of sex crime complainants so long as that is possible and conforms to fair journalistic standards. In cases of major political or civic interest, that practice needs to be continually reviewed. And as The Times explained when it finally disclosed the name of the woman in this case, it did so only after her identity became known throughout her community and received detailed nationwide publicity.
(Press issues raised by the Palm Beach case are discussed more fully in an article today on page A14.)
Whenever possible, The Times intends to continue its longstanding practice of withholding the names of sex crime victims while informing its readers in the fullest and fairest ways about major cases.

CORRECTION-DATE: April 26, 1991, Friday
PUB-DATE: April 27, 1991

 CORRECTION:
An article on April 17 portrayed the life and background of the woman who has accused William Kennedy Smith of rape at the Kennedy estate in Palm Beach, Fla., on March 30.
The article drew no conclusions about the truth of her complaint to the police. But many readers inferred that its very publication, including her name and detailed biographical material about her and her family, suggested that The Times was challenging her account.
Because of an editing error, an article on April 17 about Patricia Bowman, the woman who has accused William Kennedy Smith of rape, misstated her history at the Tallmadge (Ohio) High School. Although she enrolled for the 1976-77 academic year, she withdrew in the fall; her academic record was compiled elsewhere.

HEADLINE: Homer Bigart, Acclaimed Reporter, Dies

BYLINE: By RICHARD SEVERO

 BODY:
Homer Bigart, one of the most accomplished reporters in American journalism, died yesterday at the Edgewood Center in Portsmouth, N.H., where he had been hospitalized for two months. Mr. Bigart, who wrote for both The New York Herald Tribune and The New York Times, was 83 years old and lived in West Nottingham, N.H.
He died of cancer, his wife, Else, said. 
 In a calling whose end product tends to be ephemeral and forgettable, in which writers nervously jest that they are only as good as their last story, Mr. Bigart stood as an enduring role model.
During a prize-collecting career of nearly four decades, he always seemed to be at the top of his game, much to the dismay of his competitors.
His articles remained taut, witty and astringently understated, even when created under deadline pressure and the appalling working conditions imposed by war and famine; even when they concerned mundane events that lesser reporters regarded as routine. Mr. Bigart knew that what counted was not the place but the poetry and that a reporter could create memorable prose from even the most unremarkable happening.
Such pieces became models of grace by which young reporters measured their own talent, and they were the reality from which a legend was born. In journalism schools and in the drafty city rooms of a town that always prided itself on being the ultimate stop for the nation's most gifted newspaper reporters, Mr. Bigart was regarded with awe.
He won most of the major national and local prizes in journalism. There was a Pulitzer Prize, and there was an uncommon second Pulitzer. There were an Overseas Press Club award and the George Polk Memorial Award and the Meyer Berger Award and a Page One Award, and many others.
All were given for the resourcefulness and courage that Mr. Bigart repeatedly showed in World War II, the Greek civil war, the Korean War and the turbulent years that followed, when he wrote about the civil-rights struggle and hunger and the extraordinary changes that were taking place in urban and rural America.
All of his articles were written either for The Herald Tribune, where he worked from 1929 to 1955, or The Times, where he worked from 1955 until his retirement in 1972.
If his reporter friends told him that the encomiums in his stocking approached an indecent level, they were proud that he had won such praise, because they felt he was the best of them. Wherever he went and whatever he did, his copy rose above the moment; no awards judge could resist Mr. Bigart at his best.
 
Describing History In the Making
 For example, there was the opening of the article he wrote from the battleship Missouri on Sept. 2, 1945, telling readers of The Herald Tribune that one of the greatest military struggles in world history was finally over:
"Japan, paying for her desperate throw of the dice at Pearl Harbor, passed from the ranks of the major powers at 9:05 A.M. today when Foreign Minister Mamoru Shigemitsu signed the document of unconditional surrender.
"If the memories of the bestialities of the Japanese prison camps were not so fresh in mind, one might have felt sorry for Shigemitsu as he hobbled on his wooden leg toward the green baize covered table where the papers lay waiting.
"He leaned heavily on his cane and had difficulty seating himself. The cane, which he rested against the table, dropped to the deck of this battleship as he signed."
And there was the time in 1943 that he took a troopship to London and was surprised that it had not been torpedoed, reports of scores of U-boats to the contrary. Three paragraphs from the end of his dispatch he wrote:
"Then you woke up one morning and the ship was very steady, and you knew she had entered the harbor. You had arrived. You had crossed the submarine-infested Atlantic without sighting even a porpoise. A hell of a thing to have to confess to your grandchildren."
War is damaging to the sense of humor of those who are caught up in it, but Mr. Bigart, describing the American Army's pursuit of the Germans in Sicily and noting that civilian conduct had been "exemplary," wrote this on July 25, 1943, as a last paragraph:
"In fact, the Sicilians are too friendly. Their attitude strengthens the impression that this island is a forgotten portion of Southern California, instead of a segment of enemy Italy."<nm But there were times when he had to describe death, as he did on Dec. 18, 1943, from San Pietro, Italy:
"Generally, there is no mistaking the dead -- their strange contorted posture leaves no room for doubt. But this soldier, his steel helmet tilted over his face, seemed merely resting in the field. We did not know until we came within a few steps and saw a gray hand hanging limply from a sleeve."
After he joined The Times, Mr. Bigart covered such important assignments as the trial of Adolf Eichmann, the Nazi war criminal, in Israel in 1961. The following year Mr. Bigart surveyed the war in Vietnam. He was already in his middle 50's, but he had lost none of his ability to understand a situation and report it quickly.
 
Shy, Private Man, Insouciant Wit
 David Halberstam, who succeeded Mr. Bigart for The Times, recalled that Mr. Bigart was one of the first reporters to conclude that contrary to the Pentagon's representations, America was not about to win an easy war, and that the war was in fact a tragedy and a mistake. He advised younger reporters to write that the American effort "just doesn't work."
Mr. Halberstam said Mr. Bigart's irreverence, his "unerring instincts," his willingness to challenge "the official version" and his leadership were the sustenance that younger reporters needed to chronicle an unprecedented American military tragedy.
In 1963, when The Times asked him to cover the grim winter confronting unemployed coal miners in Kentucky, it was clear that Mr. Bigart had lost none of his reportorial eye:
"Creeks are littered with garbage, choked with boulders and silt dislodged by strip-mine operations. Hillsides that should be a solid blaze of autumn color are slashed with ugly terraces, where bulldozers and steam shovels have stripped away the forest to get at the coal beneath."
The legend was not built simply on his articles. It rested as much on the man himself.
Mr. Bigart, a shy and private man with a pronounced stammer, was at once retiring and combative, devoted equally, it seemed, to minding his own business and to hoisting a few with friends. It was on these occasions that he told the stories the journalists of his era loved to tell and hear. And he did it as well in bars as in print. His insouciant one-liners about people, places and things were not soon forgotten by colleagues.
At The Herald Tribune, for example, one colleague (and rival) was Marguerite Higgins, a determined World War II and Korean War correspondent who won much fame because of the aggressive way she pursued reporting. Miss Higgins was a pioneer working in what men liked to think of as their province, and she often outmaneuvered most male rivals, who, in those prefeminist days, would have preferred her to be shy and confined to the society page, or, as they might have put it, barefoot and pregnant.
On one occasion, she did become pregnant. When Mr. Bigart learned of it, he snapped: "Oh, g-good. And wh-wh- who is the mother?" Later, when the baby was born, Mr. Bigart cheerily inquired if the mother had devoured it.
Another competitor in the old days was Clifton Daniel, a correspondent for The Times in Jerusalem in the late 1940's when Mr. Bigart covered Israel for The Herald Tribune. Years later Mr. Daniel, who eventually became managing editor of The Times, recalled how hard he had to work to avoid being scooped by Mr. Bigart.
"I worked out a system for keeping an eye on him," Mr. Daniel said. "I persuaded him to move into the Eden Hotel, where I lived after the King David was bombed by the Zionist underground. Moreover I had a car, and Homer didn't; I offered to give him a lift whenever there was a big story to be covered out of town, so I always knew where he was."
But the ploy didn't work. Britain then ran Palestine under a United Nations mandate, and Mr. Daniel said that Mr. Bigart "sneaked out of the press room of the British Office of Information and held a clandestine interview one night with one of the biggest underground leaders."
"I didn't know anything about it until the next day," Mr. Daniel said.
Later, after Mr. Bigart returned to New York, he would occasionally drink martinis at a grungy newspaper bar in the Times Square area where the customers could always see what they were breathing. Taking stock of the environment one night, Mr. Bigart politely inquired of the bartender what day of the week they changed the air.
One evening, late in life, he decided to tell Murray Illson, a reporter friend at The Times, that he was marrying again. "I showed her mine, and she showed me hers," Mr. Bigart said. Before Mr. Illson could say anything, Mr. Bigart added, "Our bankbooks."
Like other great reporters of his generation, Mr. Bigart never hesitated to show disdain for his editors and independence from them. One evening late in his career, he was assigned to write about a riot, drawing on information from reporters on the street.
As one reporter, John Kifner, called in from a phone booth, rioters began shaking it and Mr. Kifner conveyed his fright to Mr. Bigart. But Mr. Bigart, busy fending off editors he regarded as hysterical, comforted Mr. Kifner by noting, "At least you're dealing with sane people."
 
From Architecture To Journalism
 Homer William Bigart was born Oct. 25, 1907, in Hawley, Pa., in the Pocono region, the son of Homer S. Bigart, a woolens manufacturer, and Anna Schardt Bigart. He attended public schools there, then ventured to Pittsburgh to enroll in the Carnegie Institute of Technology. He thought he wanted to be an architect. The institute felt otherwise.
"They found I couldn't draw," Mr. Bigart later recalled, "and invited me to find another school."
In 1929, Mr. Bigart complied. He enrolled in the New York University School of Journalism and got a job as a night copy boy on The Herald Tribune. N.Y.U. liked him well enough, but Mr. Bigart remained unconvinced that his journalism professors knew much about journalism. He dropped out, and in 1929, as the Great Depression was starting, joined The Trib full time.
Since he was neither a college graduate nor adept at office politics, he remained a copy boy for four years. But then The Trib decided to give him a chance and made him a general-assignment reporter at $25 a week.
At first, it seemed he would not make it. He was a painfully slow writer. Editors were amazed at his bizarre typing style, in which he double-spaced between words. He made the errors that young reporters are prone to make. Once, assigned to cover the start of coach railroad service between New York and Florida, he went to the wrong track and wrote about the wrong railroad.
It was in this period that Mr. Bigart found he could use his halting speech to become a more effective reporter. The stammer made it easier for him to pose as a bumbler who was not very smart. He would often say to those he interviewed something like, "G-g-gee, I d-d-didn't really understand that. C-c-could you repeat it?"
Most of those he interviewed went to extra lengths to make sure he got the story straight, and the result was that Mr. Bigart's articles seemed to be clearer than anyone else's; the quotations were invariably rich.
During the 1930's the paper found ample reason to have more and more confidence in Mr. Bigart's skills, and in 1942 he was asked if he would become a war correspondent. He agreed and went on to cover the London blitz, the bombing of Nazi Germany, the battles of North Africa, Italy and southern France.
When the war was over in Europe, he moved to the Pacific and covered the final months of the war against Japan. He always seemed determined to cover war at the cannon's mouth and was one of the first reporters to enter Hiroshima after the Americans dropped the atomic bomb.
Newsweek called him "the hardest kind of worker and the fairest kind of competitor." Philip Potter of The Baltimore Sun said Mr. Bigart "worked over his copy more than any of the rest of us correspondents, who were anxious after a hard day in the field to get our copy written and filed so we could get a drink."
"Homer would still be at his portable, crossing off one word because he had thought of a better one," Mr. Potter said. "He observed things that we had missed."
The plaudits kept coming when he covered the war in Korea. In that war, Newsweek called him "the best war correspondent of an embattled generation."
The people who ran some of the countries Mr. Bigart visited as a reporter did not entirely agree with that appraisal. Because of the independence of his reporting, he was ordered out of Hungary, Egypt, Syria, Lebanon, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Oman and Vietnam.
The Vietnamese order was rescinded; the censor admitted he had made a translation error that led him to believe that Mr. Bigart had written something obscene.
When Mr. Bigart left The Trib to join The Times, there was no particular joy in it for him. The Trib was a decade away from its demise, and its economic problems were not lost on Mr. Bigart. But it was a paper with a proud tradition of giving writers their head, and Mr. Bigart loved it.
"It seemed to me that he always looked down on The Times, even when he worked there," Mr. Daniel said. "Its main fault, in his eyes, was that it wasn't The Trib. It was too proud and stiff-necked for his taste. But he knew that if he couldn't work for The Trib, the next best thing was The Times. He was not disloyal to it; he just wasn't in love with it."
Mr. Bigart's first two wives were Alice Veit, who died in 1959 after they were divorced, and Alice Weel, who died in 1969. The next year he married Else Holmelund Minarik, the author of children's books, who survives him. He is also survived by a sister, Margaret Crowe of Lancaster, Pa., and a stepdaughter, Brooke Minarik of Dover, N.H.
No funeral is planned, the family said.

HEADLINE: BUSINESS PEOPLE;
A Traveling Executive At Scientific-Atlanta

 BODY:
When Jack Acker arrived in Las Vegas, Nev., yesterday for a convention, it was the least exotic destination he has visited in recent months.
As the president of the newly formed network systems group of Scientific-Atlanta Inc., Mr. Acker is head of a unit that has signed recent contracts for satellite communications in Guam, Malaysia and Oman, among other countries. 
 On Monday, as Scientific-Atlanta was announcing that Mr. Acker's unit is being reorganized, the Atlanta-based company also announced it had agreed to provide a transportable satellite earth station to Kuwait. The installation will provide the first incoming telephone satellite lines to Kuwait since the nation was invaded by Iraq in August.
The reorganization of Scientific-Atlanta's network systems group brings manufacturing and engineering of satellite communications equipment into the group, which had previously been responsible mainly for international marketing and support.
"Basically, this reorganization is an effort to import our export successes," Mr. Acker, who is 44, said yesterday. The company has enjoyed 20 percent annual growth in international sales, much of that coming in the network systems group's satellite communications equipment.
The international market has proved remarkably resistant to recession, Mr. Acker said.
"Certainly, we sense a tight capital market on a global basis, but these communications requirements won't wait," he said. "People are not going to wait to communicate with each other."
The company has been hit by the recession. For its second quarter, ended Dec. 28, the company posted a sales decline of 15.8 percent, to $123.9 million, from $147.1 million in the corresponding quarter a year ago. Earnings per share fell from 44 cents to 15 cents.
Still, analysts predict a stronger future for the company. "The whole issue of globalization of international communications is very positive for Scientific- Atlanta," said Robert P. Anastasi, first vice president of Robinson-Humphrey Company.
"International is probably only about 10 percent of their business now, but there's no reason why it can't be half."
Indeed, William E. Johnson, chairman and chief executive officer, said yesterday from San Francisco, where he was attending a business meeting, that international business should account for 50 percent of total company sales within 10 years.
Mr. Acker said: "We're finding that our overseas customers want interconnectivity with the United States and the United States market wants to remain compatible with the foreign networks.
"We can bring the two customer bases together and have one flexible product offering that can leverage a global market. To put it simply, instead of making 400 units of one product for the domestic market and 400 of another for the foreign market, we can service both with 600 units of a single product."

HEADLINE: Italy's Latest Coalition Cabinet, Four Days Old, Loses a Partner

BYLINE: By CLYDE HABERMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ROME, April 17

 BODY:
The five-party coalition that has governed Italy for most of the last decade was reduced to a pas de quatre today when the small Republican Party walked out in a dispute over Cabinet assignments.
Of itself, the Republicans' departure will not sink the administration of Prime Minister Giulio Andreotti, which reconstituted itself only four days ago after having collapsed at the end of March. 
 But political commentators warned that the Government, the seventh led by Mr. Andreotti, has been weakened, and that will increase the chances for early national elections, not scheduled now until next year.
Since the end of the Persian Gulf war, Italy has been consumed by domestic political wrangling. That, in turn, has produced wide protests from newspapers and from leading figures like President Francesco Cossiga, who complains that the political leadership has neglected institutional and budgetary changes considered essential if Italy is to be ready for Western Europe's economic integration at the end of 1992.
Big business's displeasure was made clear in a front-page attack on the politicians by the financial daily Il Sole-24 Ore, which is owned by Italy's main industrial group, Confindustria. "To turn Winston Churchill's phrase around," the newspaper said, "one could say that never have so many done so little for their country."
Rather than allow his seventh Cabinet to crumble, the 72-year-old Prime Minister chose to soldier on with only a four-way coalition made up of his own Christian Democrats, the Socialists and the Social Democratic and Liberal parties. Still, he is now missing an important centrist partner that is considered an important voice on foreign-policy matters.
The Republicans, led by Giorgio La Malfa, are also close to the United States. Toward the end of the gulf war, for example, they strongly criticized Mr. Andreotti for supporting a Soviet peace plan that had been rejected by other major allies in the anti-Iraq coalition.
This time, the issue is not policy but politics. Mr. La Malfa accused the Prime Minister of betraying him by giving his Republicans three relatively low-level Cabinet ministries.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS;
Gannett's Net Drops 33.2%

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: ARLINGTON, Va., April 17

 BODY:
The Gannett Company said today that a drop in newspaper advertising sales because of the recession and the Persian Gulf war contributed to a 33.2 percent decline in first-quarter earnings.
The nation's largest newspaper company said it earned $50.1 million, or 32 cents a share, in the first three months of 1991, compared with $75 million, or 47 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenues slid 3.4 percent, to $786.5 million from $813.4 million. 
 "Our advertising-based businesses were tested during the first quarter by the reluctance of advertisers to promote their goods and services during wartime," said John J. Curley, chairman and chief executive.
Newspaper advertising revenue fell 6 percent in the first quarter, Gannett said. Classified ad linage was particularly weak, it added.
Gannett publishes 82 daily newspapers, including USA Today, and operates 10 television stations, 15 radio stations and the largest outdoor advertising company in North America.
At USA Today, advertising pages during the first quarter fell to 773 from 851 a year earlier. Broadcasting revenues were off 12 percent, to $76.8 million, compared with $87.5 million a year ago.

HEADLINE: CONSUMER RATES;
Money Fund Yields Down For Second Straight Week

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO

 BODY:
Yields of money market funds monitored by IBC/Donoghue's Money Fund Report were down for the second consecutive week in period that ended yesterday.
"This is turning out to be a stubborn recession," said Walter S. Frank, chief economist at IBC/ Donoghue's, "so expect low rates to continue for awhile." 
 Tax-exempt money fund yields fell for the second straight week, as investor demand for securities remains ahead of the market's ability to supply issues. The average number of days to maturity of securities held in portfolios declined to 48, from 49, while assets fell by $66.9 million, to a total of $1.5 billion.
For the period ended yesterday, the average seven-day compounded yield was 4.17 percent, down 5 basis points, while the 7-day simple yield was 4.09 percent, also down 5 basis points. The 30-day compounded average yield fell 9 basis points, to 4.33 percent, and the 30-day simple yield 11 basis points, to 4.24 percent. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
The taxable equivalent of the current seven-day tax-exempt compounded yield is 5.79 percent for investors in the 28 percent tax bracket and 6.17 percent for those in the 33 percent tax bracket.
 
Top Yield of 5.27%
 Of the tax-exempt funds with assets of more than $100 million, which are monitored by IBC/Donoghue's, the Strong Municipal Money Market fund produced the best return on investment for the fourth straight week, with a yield of 5.27 percent, or 110 basis points more than the seven-day compounded yield. The fund is managed by Strong/Corneliuson Capital Management Inc. in Milwaukee.
Assets of taxable funds declined by $1.5 billion, to a total of $463.6 billion. Consumer funds accounted for most of the decline as $1.4 billion in assets flowed out of the these funds, bringing the total to $347.7 billion. Assets of institutional funds fell by $97 million, to a total of $115.9 billion.
The average seven-day compounded taxable yield fell by 13 basis points, to 5.99 percent, while the 30-day yield fell 6 basis points, to 6.14 percent. Portfolio managers are buying higher-yielding securities with long maturities, reflecting their confidence that rates will not rise any time soon.
The taxable fund with the best return on investment for the period ended yesterday was Olde Premium Money Market Series, with a yield of 6.99 percent. The distributor is the Olde Discount Corporation of Detroit.
By comparison, the average for bank money market accounts, which compete with the money funds fell 3 basis points, to 5.45 percent, according to The Bank Rate Monitor.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Finishes a Bit Higher; Direction on Rates Awaited

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar closed higher yesterday after fluctuating narrowly in a session dominated by concerns about interest rates in this country and overseas.
The currency was mired in a narrow trading range for the second straight day as traders waited for clues about the direction of rates, analysts said. 
 "There's too much uncertainty about monetary policy both here in the U.S. and Germany and Japan," said Earl I. Johnson, a currency market analyst with Harris Trust and Company in Chicago. With recent Government reports indicating that the United States economy remains weak, traders are trying to figure out the Federal Reserve's next move.
The Commerce Department reported on Tuesday that housing starts fell 9.3 percent in March, and the Fed reported that industrial production also fell last month. "That could make a good case for the Fed to ease" its monetary policy and allow rates to fall, Mr. Johnson said.
All currencies are supported by higher interest rates, so if United States yields fall, the dollar would also be expected to drop.
The dollar rose to 136.19 Japanese yen in New York, from 134.60 late Tuesday. In Tokyo overnight, the dollar fell to 134.97 yen, from 135.15 at Tuesday's close, and it was quoted later in London at 136.37 yen.
The British pound closed at $1.7865 in New York, down from $1.7905 late Tuesday. In earlier London trading, sterling fell to $1.7835 from $1.7900.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Tuesday's quotes, were: 1.4225 Swiss francs, up from 1.4170; 5.6430 French francs, up from 5.6265; 1,237.00 Italian lire, up from 1,234.00, and 1.15025 Canadian dollars, up from 1.14905.
 The dollar rose to 1.66835 German marks in New York, from 1.6648 late Tuesday. In earlier European trading, the dollar closed at 1,6720 marks, up from 1.6645.

HEADLINE: Comments of Gorbachev: 'A Sign of Frankness'

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's address to the Japanese Parliament yesterday in Tokyo, as provided by the English-language service of the official Soviet press agency Tass:
 Talks with Prime Minister Kaifu and other state leaders are being held in a good atmosphere. I think they will open the way to new relations between the Soviet Union and Japan. There have been no taboo subjects, we did not smooth out sharp angles, did not evade divergences or differences of some evaluations. This is a sign of frankness and the emergence of trust.

 	 	 		. . .	 	Now I wish to go over to the problems of Soviet-Japanese relations. They are not inert, of course. Our relations exist and are active. Interest in each other is growing. However, it is obvious that the dimensions and growth rates of these relations lag behind our potentialities and needs, lag behind the desired levels. 
 Why? Let me invite members of the Japanese Parliament to give some thought to this.
There is hardly a field of international activity today, where any of us, at state level, would like to harm another country, where mutual interest could not be derived. Even in the cold-war years neither we in Moscow nor, as far as we know, Tokyo aimed at solving any problems in bilateral relations using military force.
Of course, the cold-war legacy is tenacious. Mistrust is still felt despite Soviet statements that it will never attack Japan. Japan seems to be beginning to overcome fears of the Soviet military threat. Our new military doctrine, which naturally also applies to the oriental direction, proceeds from the principle of exclusive defensive sufficiency.

 	 	 		. . .	 	We will cut Soviet military presence in the Asia-Pacific region. That process would have been faster if other naval powers had displayed reciprocity.
 
Asia-Pacific Talks
 I think that all this is being closely analyzed here in Tokyo.
I think it is necessary to stress that the Soviet Union is prepared to begin a concrete dialogue with Japan on military issues. This could remove mutual suspicions and proposals have been conveyed to your Government.
I think it might be advisable to begin trilateral Soviet-Japanese-American consultations. We see their goal in removing suspicions and building confidence through concrete agreements.

 	 	 		. . .	 	Now about Soviet-Japanese relations in the context of processes in the Asia-Pacific region. History had it that the Soviet Union has become a huge Eurasian state with unique peculiarities and possibilities. Japan, with its scientific, technical, industrial and financial potential plays a leading role in the Asia-Pacific region. Thus, it is impossible to imagine the dynamics of the world process on nearly half of the globe without these two states.

 	 	 		. . .	 	A multitude of complicated economic, ethnic, social, religious and ecological problems are awaiting solution in the countries of the region, which is inhabited by half of the globe's population. Not a single country can resolve such problems on its own and so it is necessary to pool efforts and channel material and other resources that are still being squandered on armaments.

 	 	 		. . .	 	In this sense we say that it is expedient to begin a five-sided conference involving the U.S.S.R., the United States, the P.R.C., India and Japan. We attach precisely this sense to our proposal to hold a meeting of foreign ministers of all countries of the Asia-Pacific region in 1993.
The time has come for a practical approach to the idea of creating a zone of cooperation in the sea of Japan. It could become a good proving ground for economic integration in the Asia-Pacific region.
 
Past and Future Ties
 We are interested in linking the economy of the Far East and Siberia to the economic complex shaping in the Asia-Pacific region. Being aware of the difficulties, we also see enormous opportunities.

 	 	 		. . .	 	There were many things between our countries that left bitter memories in the hearts and minds of both peoples. What can be done? One can continue to dwell on the past and nurse grudges.
But this is futile. It is necessary to choose a different road -- to reconsider the common past for the sake of the present and the future.

 	 	 		. . .	 	It is utterly abnormal that the Soviet Union and Japan have not had a peace treaty up to now, a treaty which would draw a legal line under the Second World War.

 	 	 		. . .	 	Naturally, the great powers and their leaders bear special responsibility.

 	 	 		. . .	 	Let us jointly seek answers to our epoch's challenges and jointly exert efforts to make our common hopes for the future come true.
Leo Tolstoy once said, addresssing his Japanese colleague, writer Tokutomi Roka: "You ask me about ways to establish lasting friendship between Russia and Japan. It is necessary. We will be able to achieve this goal only if we are urged on to it by a mutual desire."
May these words be the lodestar indicating the way which will lead our peoples to a real meeting with each other.

HEADLINE: Once-Paternal Insurers Trim Jobs

BYLINE: By ERIC N. BERG, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CHICAGO, April 17

 BODY:
America's giant insurance companies are abandoning their cherished tradition of paternalism, cutting jobs on a scale almost unthinkable a few years ago.
The cutbacks come after insurers have failed to improve results through more tentative means like dropping poorly performing insurance lines and brokers who yield the companies no profits. 
 Several major companies have begun cutting back. The USF&G Corporation of Baltimore, with major losses in its real estate and "junk bond" portfolios, said earlier this month that it would reduce its work force by 2,800 people, or 25 percent, in 1991. The Metropolitan Life Insurance Company said it would offer early retirement to 4,000 of its 9,000 New York employees, and that 1,000 were expected to accept.
 
Other Recent Layoffs
 Others announced staff reductions in the previous months: The Aetna Life and Casualty Company is cutting 2,600 employees, or roughly 5.5 percent of its domestic work force; the Equitable Life Assurance Society of the United States, 757 employees, or 11.7 percent of its total, and the Travelers Corporation, 1,000 employees, or 3 percent percent of its total. The John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance Company has reportedly had heavy layoffs too, but declines to comment.
Except for USF&G, the percentages of workers involved are not huge; together, the cutbacks amount to less than 1 percent of the 2.1 million people who, according to the Labor Department, worked in insurance as of Dec. 31. Many of the cuts came as companies left unprofitable insurance lines, like Aetna's decision to stop writing individual health policies. To the extent that these policies will be issued by others, the jobs eliminated by Aetna will be made up elsewhere.
Nonetheless, the latest layoffs are the most severe that many in the industry remember. While they have cut their staffs before, the biggest insurers have long been known as benevolent parents, where most held onto their jobs in good times or bad. Insurers could get away with consistent staffing regardless of business volume because many were mutuals, owned by policyholders, not by investors. One insurer, Metropolitan Life, still gives employees a free hot lunch every day.
Lately, returns in many insurance lines have worsened so much that even the most protective of insurers have begun to wield the ax.
"For years, insurers viewed themselves as having a wider, statesmanlike position in America," said Sean Mooney, chief economist at the Insurance Information Institute, a New York trade group. "They would wage expensive campaigns against drunk driving and auto theft even if they hurt profits. Now that is changing. More and more, people running insurance companies are saying, 'This is a business, and it has got to be run for the bottom line.' "
Behind the work-force reductions lies the toughest business environment insurers have faced in years.
For life insurers, fierce competition from investment firms has made it much harder to win money-management business from pension funds. Lower prices for real estate and junk bonds have cut deeply into life insurers' investment returns.
Property-and-casualty insurers, meanwhile, have been grappling with a fourth year of depressed premium levels for commercial liability policies. They face a continually expanding legal definition of liability. Many business liability insurers say they never dreamed of having to pay for pollution cleanup, an area of coverage that courts are often forcing them to provide.
Auto insurance lines have their own problems, among them rate rollbacks by the states and soaring jury awards and medical costs.
All this has taken a toll. According to the A.M. Best Company, a research firm based in Oldwick, N.J., property-and-casualty insurers reported an average return on shareholders' investment of 6.7 percent in 1990 -- up from 6.1 percent in 1989 but still well below what investment professionals say the insurers should be earning given their risks.
Life insurers' returns were much better -- about 13 percent in 1989, by A.M. Best's most recent figure -- but still below the 17 percent to 20 percent that top-performing companies in other sectors generate. Industry experts say that life insurance returns fell sharply last year under the weight of junk bond defaults and continued weakness in real estate.
All sides agree that the job reductions are needed to lift insurer returns, but not about whether the companies are cutting fat or muscle. Most consumer groups and some analysts have long said that many of the country's biggest insurers could stand a diet.
"Most of these companies have not been very efficient," said Gloria Vogel, who follows the industry for Bear, Stearns & Company. "Among property-and-casualty companies, 30 percent of every premium dollar goes to expense."
George G. C. Parker, who teaches about financial institutions at the Stanford Business School, says that many insurers became complacent. With the large amount of capital and the knowledge of regulations required to enter the industry, Professor Parker said, "insurers could afford to be a little sloppy in productivity and still earn a decent return."
But Mr. Mooney of the Insurance Information Institute said that insurers' expense-to-revenue ratio was no worse than that of other industries. Banks spend about 30 percent of their interest income on overhead, department stores 35 percent and specialty stores 38.6 percent.
 
More Layoffs Loom
 Alan Levin, the senior insurance specialist at the Standard & Poor's Corporation, said that despite some seemingly high costs -- like agent's commissions equal to 15 percent of a policy's first-year premium -- the insurers are actually efficient. "There just are not that many excess people," he said.
Most industry experts say that more layoff announcements loom, if only because the reductions announced so far will not allow the insurers to produce a more respectable 15 percent return on shareholders' money. Any savings will benefit insurance shareholders in the form of higher profits. Higher profits, in turn, will benefit policyholders in terms of the companies' ability to pay claims.
But not all analysts believe that cutting jobs is the most sensible approach to improving returns. Most insurers continue to lose money on the insurance side of their business, profiting only by earnings on investments.
"I find it amusing that in hard times the insurers focus on reducing overhead," said Michael Smith, the insurance analyst at Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. "They accept the fact that the expense that represents 75 percent of their outlays -- namely, claims payments -- cannot be controlled."

HEADLINE: FUTURES/OPTIONS;
Optimism on the Economy Helps Most Metals Advance

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Futures prices for most metals rose yesterday as a strong stock market stoked optimism that the economy is turning around.
Prices for copper, silver, platinum and palladium -- all industrial metals, or precious metals with industrial uses -- rose strongly on the futures market as the Dow Jones industrial average climbed 17.58 points to finish at 3,004.46, its first close ever above 3,000. 
 "The perception is that the stock market is not concerned any more about lower corporate earnings and is focusing now on the economic recovery," said Bette Raptopoulos, senior metals analyst with Prudential Securities Inc. in New York.
Fred Demler, metals economist with Paine Webber Inc. in New York, said the buying in the metals markets mainly reflected "euphoria about the economy turning around."
 
Platinum Gains $3.50
 Copper futures settled 1.6 cents to 2.45 cents higher on the Commodity Exchange in New York, with the contract for delivery in April at $1.105 a pound. Silver was 7.5 cents to 7.9 cents higher on the Comex, with April at $4.087 an ounce.
On the New York Mercantile Exchange, platinum futures were $3.50 higher across the board, with April at $402.80 an ounce. Palladium was $2 higher across the board, with June at $98.25 an ounce.
Gold was the weakest performer among the precious metals, settling 40 cents to 70 cents higher on the Comex. The April contract rose 40 cents, to $361.80 an ounce.
Analysts said the copper market was also supported by the possibility of supply disruptions because of a rail strike in Zambia and threatened strikes by miners in Chile and Peru.
Grain and soybean futures prices sagged on the Chicago Board of Trade as bearish chart signals prompted a late selloff that spread from the soybean pit to the neighboring grain markets.
The decline also reflected the belief among many traders that the American rail strike could eventually cause grain to back up at elevators, reducing elevator demand and cash prices, said Don Roose, a grain analyst at U.S. Commodities Inc. in Des Moines.
Mr. Roose linked further selling to traders' dismay that the Federal Government had apparently not agreed on whether to grant new export credit guarantees to the Soviet Union. The guarantees would enable the Soviets to buy American grain.
Wheat futures settled 1 cent to 1 3/4 cents lower, with May at $2.80 1/2 a bushel; corn was 2 cents to 3 1/4 cents lower, with May at $2.54 a bushel; oats were 1/2 cent to 3/4 cent lower, with May at $1.21 1/4 a bushel; soybeans were 6 cents to 8 1/2 cents lower, with May at $5.82 1/4 a bushel.
Crude oil was 5 cents to 7 cents higher, with May at $21.71 a barrel; heating oil was 0.20 cent lower to 0.30 cent higher, with May at 56.13 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was 0.40 cent to 1.89 cents higher, with May at 74.18 cents a gallon; natural gas was 0.1 cent lower to 0.5 cent higher, with May at $1.378 per 1,000 cubic feet.

HEADLINE: G.O.P. Chairman Offers Preview of '92 Campaign

BYLINE: By ROBIN TONER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 17

 BODY:
Clayton K. Yeutter, the new chairman of the Republican National Committee, offered a preview of the 1992 campaign today, accusing the Democrats of "isolationism" in economic and foreign policy and saying their opposition to the war in the Persian Gulf was "indelibly intertwined in the American political psyche."
But Mr. Yeutter, in his first formal news conference since taking over as party chairman from the Lee Atwater, who died last month of a brain tumor, also struggled with an issue that could be deeply divisive for his party in 1992: abortion. The new party chairman said the staunchly anti-abortion stance of the current Republican platform was consistent with the views of President Bush. "I see no reason for significant changes in that platform," Mr. Yeutter added.
 
Protests From Some Groups
 His remarks drew protests from Republicans who support the right to choose abortion and want the party to ease its stance on the issue. "It's terribly disappointing," said Mary Dent Crisp, chairwoman of the National Republican Coalition for Choice.
 Mr. Yeutter, widely regarded as a political novice when he accepted the President's invitation to move from his post as Secretary of Agriculture to the party's chairmanship, painted the Democrats today as a party in disarray, unable to agree on a Presidential candidate or a set of issues and haunted by their opposition to the war. 
 He was particularly critical of Democrats who oppose extending "fast track" authority to the President to negotiate a free-trade pact with Mexico. He said their stance reflected "the continued shift of that party to a position of international isolationism that was reflected in some of the debate on the Persian Gulf as well."
He also asserted that the vote on the use of force in the gulf -- a majority of Democrats voted against it in January -- was "one that is likely to be recalled over and over again by American voters as they evaluate candidates."
Clearly bullish about the Presidential campaign, Mr. Yeutter said that "an argument can be made for a relatively late formal launch to the campaign" and that Mr. Bush would probably not enter the race formally until 1992. The chairman also said that he would like to see campaigns "tilt toward the fairness side," and that he believed Americans were "beginning to rebel against some of the campaign tactics used by candidates on both sides of the political aisle."
Such comments mark a break with the aggressive style of his predecessor, Mr. Atwater. Mr. Yeutter also seemed to set a different tone from Mr. Atwater on the subject of abortion. Before he fell ill, Mr. Atwater was trying to reposition Republicans on abortion, describing the party as a "big tent" with room for differing views on the issue.
 
In Accord on G.O.P. Platform
 But today Mr. Yeutter took a firm line on the party's platform, which is commited to a constitutional amendment overturning Roe V. Wade, the 1973 Supreme Court decision recognizing a constitutional right to abortion. "It seems to me that the existing language in the platform on that subject and a good many other subjects is consistent with the view laid out by the President and by the Administration," the chairman said. "It's a view I share."
Asked how that compared with Mr. Atwater's "big tent" doctrine, he said nothing in the platform "would preclude people of divergent views from being supportive of the President or the Republican Party." 
Ms. Crisp said Republicans who support the right to choose an abortion intend to challenge the platform, "which we feel is inconsistent with the majority feeling in our party." She added, "I would suspect that the Administration and the party leadership feel they still have to pander to the right wing, and I don't feel they need to do that."
Kate Michelman, executive director of the National Abortion Rights Action League, said, "Yeutter appears to have folded up the big tent that other Republican leaders attempted to pitch more than a year ago."

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS;
Maxwell's Mirror Group To Go Public

BYLINE: By STEVEN PROKESCH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LONDON, April 17

 BODY:
Hoping to reduce his empire's heavy debts and take advantage of a buoyant British stock market, Robert Maxwell announced plans today to take his Mirror Group newspapers public by selling investors as much as 49 percent. The company includes five major British tabloids and might eventually add The Daily News in New York, recently acquired by Mr. Maxwell.
At a news conference today, Mr. Maxwell said that his Mirror Group, might buy the non-British newspapers that he owned as soon as they became profitable. These are The Daily News; The European, a weekly pan-European, English-language newspaper that Mr. Maxwell founded last May, and interests in some German, Eastern European and Israeli newspapers.
 
Allocation of Proceeds
 Although the Mirror Group share price will not be announced until April 30, analysts expect the offering to raise $401.1 million to $445.6 million. The company expects to complete the sale by May 20. 
 According to a document, $374.3 million of the proceeds from the stock sale will be used to reduce the Mirror Group's bank debt. At the end of 1990, the company owed $725.9 million to banks, with lease obligations and other debts of $472.7 million.
Last month, Mr. Maxwell also cited debts when the Maxwell Communication Corporation, the other major public company his family controls, agreed to sell Pergamon Press, a leading publisher of scientific journals and books, to Elsevier N.V., a Dutch publisher. The completion of that $784.3 million deal will leave Maxwell Communication with debts of $1.96 billion.
In the late 1980's, Maxwell Communication borrowed heavily for two big acquisitions: Macmillan Inc., the book publisher, for $2.6 billiion, and the Official Airlines guide, which provides flight schedules, for $750 million.
The debts of other private companies owned by Mr. Maxwell and his family are unknown.
Mr. Maxwell predicted that The Daily News and The European would be profitable by the end of the year. The Daily News can count on turning a profit by then because of union and supplier concessions approaching $100 million a year, he said. He anticipates a sharp recovery in the paper's circulation.
The newspapers owned by the Mirror Group -- The Daily Mirror, and The Sunday Mirror; their Scottish counterparts, The Daily Record and The Sunday Mail, and The People, a weekly -- are mass-market tabloids. The Daily Mirror, with an average circulation of nearly 3 million in March, is the No. 2 paper in Britain after its archrival, The Sun, the tabloid owned by Rupert Murdoch's News International P.L.C. The Sunday Mirror and The People are Britain's second- and third-largest Sunday papers, after News of the World, another News International tabloid.
Mr. Maxwell purchased the British papers for 113 million from Reed International P.L.C. in 1984.
The Mirror Group now has other significant assets including a 25.8 percent of Canada's Quebecor Printing Inc., North America's second-largest commercial printer, and 26.4 percent of Donohue Inc., a Canadian forest products company that is a large newsprint supplier to the Mirror Group.
The figures released today demonstrate how Mr. Maxwell has turned around the newspapers he bought from Reed. In 1990, the Mirror Group's operating earnings excluding Quebcor and Donohue rose 35.3 percent, to 88.3 million, or $170.2 million, on revenues of 445 million, or $858 million. In the year ending March 31, 1984, the last full year under Reed, the newspaper group had an operating profit of 4.3 million on revenues of 274 million.
Mr. Maxwell raised earnings by nearly halving the work force, significantly increasing productivity, investing heavily in modern printing plants and becoming the newspaper industry's leader in color printing and installing equipment to insert special advertising sections.
But the newspaper market in Britain is mature, with declining readership among the young. A recession is hurting advertising.
Analysts said investors might also worry about the Mirror Group's debts, and question the $1.11 billion value the company is placing on its newspapers.

HEADLINE: Ashton-Tate Shows Profit

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, April 17

 BODY:
The Ashton-Tate Company said today that it returned to profitability in the first quarter after two quarters of losses.
The company cited strong sales of its core software product, dBase IV version 1.1, which is the leading database management software for personal computers. 
 Ashton-Tate said first-quarter net income was $3.1 million, or 12 cents a share, compared with a loss of $979,000 in the comparable period a year earlier. Sales rose 10 percent, to $62.9 million, from $57.0 million in the first quarter of 1990. Per share figures reflect a 5 percent drop in shares outstanding, to 25.4 million.
"We have made good progress in reducing costs over the past year, and this has improved the quarter's profitability," Bill Lyons, Ashton-Tate's president and chief executive officer, said in a statement. "However, we remain cautious for the future because of continued weak economies in several countries.
Ashton-Tate is currently appealing a December ruling by a Federal district court judge in Los Angeles that the company's copyrights on dBase are invalid. The ruling was based on Ashton-Tate's failure to disclose that dBase was based on an earlier program developed at the California Institute of Technology's Jet Propulsion Lab for mainframe computers, and came in response to a suit brought by the company against Fox Software Inc., which makes a program compatible with dBase.

HEADLINE: Bankruptcies On the Rise

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 17

 BODY:
The number of bankruptcies filed in United States courts each year has more than doubled since 1981, with most cases now filed by consumers, the American Bankruptcy Institute said today.
Bankruptcies rose to 782,962 last year, up from 360,329 in 1981, it said, and filings are expected to jump to 810,000 this year and 890,000 next year as the recession and problems in the banking industry take their toll. 
 About 90 percent of the bankruptcies last year were filed by consumers overwhelmed by debts, officials of the institute said. The number of individual consumers filing for bankruptcy has doubled since 1985, while the number of corporate bankruptcy filings fell slightly, they said.
"As bankruptcy becomes more socially acceptable, people are finding it more comfortable to move into the courts," said the institute's vice chairman, L. E. Creel.
Corporate debt problems are often resolved outside the courtroom, which may be one reason for the decline in corporate bankruptcies, he said.
States that suffered falling real estate values and bank failures experienced huge increases in bankruptcies. The number of bankruptcy filings in Texas jumped by 148 percent in the second half of the decade; in Massachusetts, bankruptcy filings rose 272 percent in the period, and in New Hampshire, they rose 243 percent.

HEADLINE: AFTER THE WAR;
Americans Aiding Kurds See A 'Major Change in Direction'

BYLINE: By JOHN KIFNER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DIYARBAKIR, Turkey, April 17

 BODY:
American military officers, diplomats and aid workers in this eastern Turkish city, a staging area for relief, were taken by surprise by President Bush's speech Tuesday night announcing plans to establish camps for the Kurds.
"It was sort of like the start of the war -- somebody called up and said 'Turn on C.N.N.' " said a United States Embassy official working with the operation here, a base for helicopter relief about 100 miles from the point where the Turkish and Iraqi borders intersect. "We don't know anything at this end yet." 
 Comdr. John Woodhouse of the Navy, spokesman for the United States European Command, said tonight, "This is taking a major change in direction, and the answers are not going to come quick."
As sheep and cows grazed just off the airport runway here, carts pulled by bony horses plied the main street passing rows of Kurds, refugees from an influx in 1988.
The handful of shabby hotels are filling up with relief workers and journalists, and at the military air base this afternoon, a big Soviet cargo plane stood near United States Air Force C-130's and Army Chinook helicopters in dull olive battle paint, having delivered a load of Soviet relief supplies.
British and American soldiers were putting up a tent city near the runway to house their growing effort. Stacked along one edge of the tarmac were neat piles of cargo: powdered baby formula, cases of medicine, tents from the Italian Government, cots from the German Red Cross.
Private relief groups bring their shipments here, and the military carries them on by helicopter. Save the Children, for example, dropped off 32 tons of goods the other day, including plastic sheeting for shelters
Farther south, at Silopi on the Iraqi border, where the helicopters bring the relief supplies, about 2,000 American soldiers and marines are putting up their own camp to serve as a distribution point.
Here, there was one sign of preparations for the new plan -- marines in full combat gear practicing leaping out of helicopters and forming a defensive perimeter. It is a role the marines could play as part of the mobile "rapid response force" deployed to protect the camps from any Iraqi attacks.
The plan is believed to have been pressed by the Turkish President, Turgut Ozal, who was worried about the uneasy presence of about 600,000 more Kurds, an economic drain on this poor country and a potentially destabilizing element in a part of Turkey with its own simmering Kurdish nationalism.
The American military's goal here had been to deliver emergency supplies, create a logistical system and at the end of 30 days, be able to hand over the entire operation to private aid agencies.
A new timetable announced by the Pentagon at a briefing today -- having construction on the Iraqi camps begin in a few days and the bases operating within a couple of weeks -- seemed unrealistic to some of the experienced aid workers here.
"We would do 20 days of intensive planning, including selecting the sites," a relief official said. "It would be 25 days before we turn the first spade of earth, and maybe in about a month after that, it would be ready for 10,000 people."

HEADLINE: Caps Suggested for U.S. Health Spending

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGON, April 17

 BODY:
The Comptroller General of the United States, Charles A. Bowsher, said today that the nation should seriously consider setting limits on total public and private spending for major categories of health care, like doctors' services, hospital care and new technology.
In so doing, Mr. Bowsher said, the United States might follow the example of other industrial countries that seem to have had more success in limiting the growth of health spending. The United States spends more than $600 billion a year on health care. 
 Mr. Bowsher is head of the General Accounting Office, an investigative arm of Congress that has, in recent years, moved beyond the auditing of Government accounts to the analysis of diverse Federal programs. His testimony today was significant because the accounting office is normally cautious in its recommendations, making proposals only after extensive research.
Mr. Bowsher did not say exactly how the Government could limit private spending on health care by employers and individuals. Nor did he say how such limits could be reconciled with the principles of a free-market economy.
 
'Must Move to Reforms'
 But Mr. Bowsher told the House Ways and Means Committee: "We must move from incremental cost-cutting initiatives to reforms that encompass the entire U.S. health care system. Further piecemeal reforms, whether undertaken by business or government, are unlikely to reduce the growth of national health spending substantially."
Instead, Mr. Bowsher said, "reform must be comprehensive." Specifically, he said, health insurance should be available to everyone, and "we should cap total expenditures for major categories of providers and services, including physicians, hospitals and new technology."
Mr. Bowsher said that the limits for health spending could be adjusted each year, so that if a particular category exceeded its goal in one year, it would receive less in a subsequent year.
 
He Recommends Many Payers
 He emphasized that he was not recommending a national health insurance scheme with the Federal Government as the only payer. He said health care should be financed by many payers, including private insurers, the Federal Government and the states. But, he said, they should all "play by essentially the same rules," offering similar packages of health care benefits and paying similar amounts to doctors, hospitals and other health care providers for the same services.
The Comptroller General also said he was not suggesting that the United States copy the health care system of any specific foreign country. But he said the United States could learn from other countries, saying:
"For example in Canada, the provincial governments negotiate a fixed budget for each hospital. The hospital has to determine how best to provide care while living within this budget.
"As another example, Germany has controlled expenditures on physicians by establishing a schedule of fees for each type of physician service, and by setting a target for overall spending on physician care. If physicians increase the number of services they provide, and expenditures threaten to exceed the target, the fees are reduced so that actual spending stays within the target."
Republican members of the committee, including Representatives Bill Archer of Texas and Don Sundquist of Tennessee, voiced skepticism. Mr. Archer said it would do no good to limit spending on doctors and hospitals if their costs, for medical malpractice insurance, for instance, rose relentlessly.
"We should not be lulled into simplistic alternatives for cost containment such as price controls," Mr. Archer said. "We know from experience that such approaches are inherently flawed and always make conditions worse."
Mr. Bowsher's proposals appear to be inconsistent with the main themes of the health policies advocated by Presidents Bush and Ronald Reagan. For the last decade, the Department of Health and Human Services has called for more competition in prices and services among hospitals, doctors and health insurers.
Far from seeking uniform benefits or payment rates, the Bush and Reagan Administrations have tried to increase the number and diversity of options avilable to consumers.
Some Democrats on the Ways and Means Committee, including Representative Marty Russo of Illinois, enthusiastically endorsed Mr. Bowsher's conclusions. Mr. Russo noted that more than 30 million Americans still lacked health insurance.
Mr. Bowsher, like many of the Democrats, said that a more comprehensive health care system, with uniform procedures for filing and paying claims, could dramatically cut administrative costs.
"With multiple payers basically offering the same services, you can cut down a lot of the administrative costs," he said.

HEADLINE: Market Place;
At Last, Dow Closes Above 3,000

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS

 BODY:
The Dow Jones industrial average closed above 3,000 for the first time yesterday, marking another milestone in a bull market that has seen stocks around the world rise sharply since last fall, when concerns peaked over the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait and higher oil prices.
Propelled by lower interest rates and by expectations that the recession will end soon, the Dow gained 17.58 points, on strong volume of 246.9 million shares, and closed at 3,004.46. It has risen 27 percent since Oct. 11. 
 With the notable exception of Germany, central banks in most major countries have been lowering interest rates. In Britain and the United States, they have sought to end recessions; in other countries, they are trying to avoid downturns.
"Lower interest rates boost stock prices." said Edward Kerschner, the chief investment strategist at Paine Webber Inc. He called that strategy "the big ease," and added, "It is fundamentally bullish." Mr. Kerschner said he thought the Dow would rise to at least 3,150 by the end of this year.
A sharp rise in stock prices usually provides an indication that economic growth will increase, and the Dow's rise since October has been viewed by many as an indication that the recession will end soon -- even though the evidence that economic activity has bottomed is fragmentary, at best.
Whatever its status as a leading economic indicator, the Dow this year has been something of a lagging stock market indicator. The broader stock market, as measured by the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, has been reaching highs since February, and the Nasdaq composite average of thousands of over-the-counter stocks has gained 57 percent since the October low. Both hit new highs again yesterday.
"It's a little belated," said Robert Farrell, the chief market analyst at Merrill Lynch & Company. "The Dow is finally catching up."
At the New York Stock Exchange yesterday, the closing bell at 4 P.M. was greeted with cheering and some throwing of paper, but the reaction was much more restrained than at some previous celebrations of new highs, exchange officials said.
Even without the Dow topping 3,000, individual investors have been flocking back into the market through direct purchases of stocks and investments in stock mutual funds. "We're looking at double to triple the level of new sales we saw last fall," said Michael Hines, a vice president of Fidelity Investments, the nation's largest mutual fund group.
Institutional investors have also been eager buyers, investing cash they had held back from the market in late 1990, amid worries over war and recession. Most money managers are judged on how well they do compared with the stock market, and those who were not fully invested have scrambled to catch up.
The Dow's assault on 3,000 succeeded on its third try. The first came in July, before the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, when the average twice closed daily sessions at 2,999.75, the highest level possible without topping the barrier. Then, last month, the Dow briefly topped 3,000 during trading, but again fell back.
The difficulty the Dow experienced in exceeding 3,000 inevitably brought back memories of the average's long and difficult effort to climb over 1,000. It took nearly 17 years, from early 1966 when the Dow first touched 1,000 to late 1982 when it finally crossed that barrier for what now appears to be the final time. On the other hand, in 1987 the Dow moved through 2,000 with barely a moment's notice, and within eight months it had topped 2,700, only to crash to below 2,000 in October.
Although the Dow ended yesterday less than 5 points above where it was on July 16, some components of the average have shown vastly different patterns, reflecting the tumultous events in the world since then. Over that period, Iraq invaded Kuwait and was defeated by an international force. An American recession began, but hopes for a quick recovery have grown since the end of the war.
Still, several large companies heavily dependent on the economy are trading 20 percent or more below their level on July 16, including General Motors, Goodyear and Westinghouse. Less economically sensitive stocks, among them Coca-Cola, Merck and Philip Morris, have posted large gains.
A big stimulus to higher prices, and to investor confidence, has been the Federal Reserve's aggressive easing of credit to spur economic growth. On July 16, when the Dow first closed at 2,999.75, the rate on three-month Treasury bills was 7.62 percent. The rate now is 5.56 percent.
Those lower rates have helped reassure investors that the recession will end and have made investments in bonds less attractive, leading investors to turn to stocks.
But long-term interest rates have not declined as much and have risen recently amid speculation that the Fed might not continue to ease. The yield on 30-year Treasury bonds, at 8.45 percent in July, is now 8.10 percent.
Investors have nervously watched interest rates. "What would make us nervous is a significant rise in interest rates," said Abby Joseph Cohen, the co-chairman of the investment policy committee at Goldman, Sachs & Company. "We do not think that is going to happen."
At current profit levels, there is little doubt that stock prices are unreasonably high. The expectation of improvement has sustained the market, but there may be limits as to how far that can go.
"Right now, the market does not care about earnings," said Byron R. Wien, the chief United States strategist for Morgan Stanley & Company. "It just cares that the recovery is out there. But at a point later this year, if the earnings are not there, the market will be disappointed."
"At numbers much higher than 3,000, the market begins to discount a strong recovery in the second half, and I don't think we will have one," Mr. Wien added. He said he thought the Dow would fall below 3,000 later this year.
For Wall Street, this year's bull market has come as a great relief. While 1990 was the worst year for brokerage industry profits in decades, the first quarter of this year saw generally good earnings, reflecting both rising prices and the commissions that come from rising trading volume.
"This comes after three very difficult years on the equity side," said Richard Grasso, the president of the New York Stock Exchange. "It is greatly welcomed, and hopefully it is a sign of things to come."

HEADLINE: Panel Says Dialysis Cutbacks May Be Increasing Death Toll

BYLINE: By PHILIP J. HILTS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 17

 BODY:
Spending cuts in the Federal Government's life-saving kidney dialysis program may be resulting in unnecessary sickness and death, a panel of experts said today.
But Dr. Gail Wilensky, chief of the Health Care Financing Administration, which runs the dialysis program, disputed the suggestion. 
 The kidney program is the only one in which the Government tries to provide treatment for everyone who has a disease, regardless of income. It was begun with 10,000 eligible patients in 1973, when dialysis treatments were so costly that only the rich could afford them and hospitals were forced to limit access to scarce dialysis machines.
Today the Government pays for treatments for 150,000 people at an annual cost of nearly $4 billion. The treatment filters the blood of the toxic waste products that are normally eliminated by the kidneys and excreted in the urine. But it has been a huge financial burden to the Government because it has cost more than 10 times what was expected.
 
Program in Trouble
 The panel of the Institute of Medicine, which is affiliated with the National Academy of Sciences, said that while the program had succeeded in saving hundreds of thousands of lives, it was now in trouble.
The number of people eligible for the program is expected to rise to 240,000 by the end of the decade. At the same time, because of cuts and because there have been no increases for inflation, the rate of money paid out for claims has dropped by 60 percent.
Because of the drops in financing, services and staff have been cut back, and patients who used to be given 12 to 18 hours of treatment a week now get 9 to 15 hours. The committee said that it was uncertain, but there was indirect evidence that this drop in hours of treatment resulting from financial cutbacks might have "caused an increase in morbidity and mortality" among those treated, said the chairman of the institute's panel, Dr. Norman G. Levinsky, chairman of the department of medicine at Boston University.
 
Need for More Study
 Dr. Wilensky said that one study made that suggestion, but that her agency was carrying out a more complete study to better evaluate the link between reduced financing, less time on the dialysis machine and greater sickness.
She said that "it is certainly a legitimate question" but that to suggest that more people are getting sick now because of reduced financing of the centers "would be an incorrect conclusion." Doctors make the decision about how long a patient should stay on the machine, and "we would like to believe that physicians prescribe the amount of time needed according to good medical practice, not to profit."
Staffs at the dialysis centers have also decreased sharply, but Dr. Wilensky said she believed the treatment was appropriate. "As best we can tell, these facilities continue to make a profit," she said. "We could justify a continued reduction in rates."

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Prices on Corporate Bonds Rise

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
Prices of investment-grade corporate and high-yield "junk bonds" rose sharply yesterday, as investors seeking higher yields than those offered on ultra-safe Treasury securities were active buyers.
The activity in those markets stood in contrast to price movements in the secondary Treasury securities market, where prices were little changed in fairly slow trading. 
 In addition to their attractive yields, analysts and traders said the fact that the Dow Jones industrial average closed at a record high of 3,004.46 yesterday also helped to push up corporate bond prices.
Moreover, the decline in interest rates and the rise in stock prices over the past few months has increased the possibility that many highly leveraged companies can either refinance or turn high-cost debt into equity. Those conditions, in turn, have lessened investor fears about the quality of the securities they are buying.
"We think that investment-grade corporates represent better value at this stage" than Treasury securities, said William Melton, a vice president and chief economist at IDS Financial Services Inc. in Minneapolis.
Prices of most high-yield junk bonds, which posted record increases during the first quarter, rose about 3/4 of a point yesterday, traders said, although some issues were up even more sharply.
"One of last year's concerns, that companies were dependent almost exclusively on cash flow, has changed," said Kingman Penniman, a senior vice president Duff & Phelps/MCM. "Now companies have time to come up with alternative strategies to retire high-cost debt. That has prompted a whole change in attitude among investors."
"I am stupefied by what is going on," said Mariel Clemenson, director of high-yield research at Citicorp Securities Markets Inc.
 
High-Yield Securities Prices
 Ms. Clemenson added that the sharp increase in prices of high-yield securities might be overdone.
"I think the market is highly speculative and way too frothy," she said, "because the fundamental outlook for many companies could not be weaker." At current levels "prices do not reflect fundamentals."
In the secondary market for Treasury securities, the fading prospects of a near-term cut in short-term interest rates by the Federal Reserve Board led traders to sell short-term instruments and buy bonds. But the movement in prices was very slight.
"There are buyers of the long end and sellers of the short end," one government securities trader said. "That's the way it's been since the inflation numbers came out late last week and the Fed told us on Monday that they aren't about to ease."
On Monday, the Fed pointedly drained reserves from the banking system, a move that credit market analysts and traders took as a clear sign that it had no current intention of lowering short-term interest rates.
By late in the day, the Treasury's 7 7/8 percent 30-year bonds of 2021 were offered at a price of 97 14/32, up 3/32, to yield 8.10 percent, down from 8.11 percent late Tuesday.
Among note issues, the 7 3/4 percent 10-year notes were offered at a price of 98 23/32, up 1/32, to yield 7.93 percent.
Late yesterday the Treasury announced it will sell $12 billion worth of new two-year notes and $9 billion worth of new five-year notes at auctions on April 24 and April 25, respectively.
In when-issued trading after the announcement, the two-year notes were offered at a price to yield 6.91 percent. The five-year securities were offered on a when-issued basis at a price to yield 7.65 percent.
Short-term Treasury bill rates fell slightly.
By late in the day, three-month bills were offered at a discount rate of 5.56 percent, down 4 basis points, or hundreths of a percentage point. Six-month bill rates fell three basis points, to a late offered rate of 5.61 percent.
In the secondary market for investment-grade corporate bonds, traders said prices of most issues rose by anywhere from 1/2 of a point to 3/4 of a point. Outstanding bonds issued by commercial banks like Security Pacific and First Interstate did even better, market participants said.
In the tax-exempt municipal bond market, Orange County, Fla., offered $100 million worth of sanitation bonds in a negotiated sale through Merrill Lynch & Co. The securities are insured by the Financial Guaranty Insurance Company.
The issue consists of serial bonds and term bonds maturing in 2013 and 2016.
The 6 3/4 percent term bonds maturing in 2013 were priced to yield 6.85 percent. The 6 percent term bonds that mature in 2016 were priced to yield 6.75 percent.
The issue is rated AAA by both Moody's Investors Service and by the Standard & Poor's Corporation.
Traders in the secondary market for tax-exempt securities said prices of most widely quoted issues rose by about 1/4 of a point.

HEADLINE: Governors Seek $10 Billion in Increased Taxes

BYLINE: By GWEN IFILL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 17

 BODY:
Governors in a majority of the 50 states have imposed $10.3 billion in new taxes during the current fiscal year to cope with the worst financial conditions many have seen since the 1983 recession, according to a report made public today.
The cash shortage has also forced governors and legislatures in 29 states to slash spending by laying off or furloughing workers, putting a freeze on hiring and capping travel expenses, the National Governors' Association said in its annual survey of state budget conditions for the fiscal year ending June 30. 
 State budget officers said their problems have been fueled by the soaring cost of health care and exacerbated by the recession.
 
Big Rise in Medicaid Spending
 Raymond Sheppach, executive director of the association, said state spending for Medicaid, which is administered jointly with the Federal Government, is expected to rise by 116 percent from 1990 to 1995.
Medicaid requirements imposed by the Federal Government, Mr. Sheppach said, are "devouring virtually every new dollar of revenue and leaving little money for new programs" at the state level. The survey said Medicaid costs have increased 25 percent this year after an 18 percent increase last year, and Mr. Sheppach said 37 states spent more on Medicaid this year than they had initially budgeted.
The cash shortage, which has been widening in state capitals for more than a year, has forced many governors to make unpalatable choices, including higher taxes, to achieve the balanced budgets required by most state constitutions.
The $10 billion in new taxes marks the biggest such increase that state budget officers have recorded since 1978. And although state spending continues to grow, it is increasing far more slowly than in the 1980's, when many states racked up budget surpluses.
Spending reductions totaling $8 billion this year will shave about 3 percent of planned spending from state budgets, the governors' report said. "Economic growth will be slower because of slower labor force participation growth, stiff international competition and a continuing national deficit," said Mr. Sheppach.
 
Concerns About the Future
 Even if the recession ends by late summer as some economists have predicted, Mr. Sheppach said, state government finances may not bounce back quickly.
"When the recession ends," he said, "the states continue to face hard times, because economic growth is declining while human needs continue to increase."
A number of states have raised taxes on gasoline or cigarettes or have increased user fees as a way of balancing their budgets, the report said.
In general, it said, the Plains and Rocky Mountain states have fared best in the current recession and West Coast states excluding California have emerged stronger than average. States in the Northeast were found to be continuing to face the most severe problems.

HEADLINE: Net Falls 48% At Polaroid

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: CAMBRIDGE, Mass., April 17

 BODY:
The Polaroid Corporation reported a 48 percent drop in first-quarter earnings today, saying the weak economy hurt consumer spending on the company's instant film.
For the three-month period that ended March 31, Polaroid reported net income of $16.4 million, or 13 cents a share, compared with $31.8 million, or 43 cents a share, during the corresponding period a year earlier. Sales totaled $441.2 million, just a 1 percent rise from $436.2 million in the first quarter of 1990. 
 The company said worldwide shipments of instant film in the quarter were down 7.3 percent, to $203.9 million.
The company said profits were also squeezed by increases in marketing costs that were needed to help build future business.

HEADLINE: AFTER THE WAR;
Confusion Is Found to Delay Aid for Kurds Fleeing to Iran

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TEHERAN, Iran, April 17

 BODY:
Western officials in Iran said today that efforts to help Kurds fleeing here from Iraq have been seriously hurt by international confusion and by some Iranian delays, endangering the lives of scores of thousands of refugees now in Iran or awaiting entry to the country.
The officials put most of the blame on the United Nations, which they said had grossly underestimated the size and speed of the exodus from Iraq and then lagged in organizing the international response to the crisis. 
 By contrast, one official said, the Iranian Government has drawn "immense admiration" for shouldering the majority of the relief effort alone despite the country's own shortages of food, medicine and money.
Kurds who have fled to regions close to the Turkish border are likely to benefit from the American aid plan announced by President Bush in Washington on Tuesday, under which the American military plans to set up secure camps for the refugees in northern Iraq. But that effort will not reach Kurds inside Iran.
 
Praise for Iranians
 Figures prepared by international relief agencies and provided by Western officials show that as of Sunday, Iran had committed $57 million to the relief effort, far more than any Western or Asian nation and a considerable sum for a government that is itself in economic straits.
"Even the most cynical of the diplomatic observers believe they have been remarkably charitable," a Western official monitoring the relief effort said in an interview today. Like others, he spoke on condition of anonymity.
But he and others said they are increasingly worried that an estimated 500,000 Kurds still trying to flee Iraq will be decimated by disease and exposure if Iran does not speed their entry into the country. The fleeing Kurds, in lines stretching as far as 50 miles into Iraq, are being required by Iran's military to undergo searches and sometimes to get entry cards for themselves and their vehicles before being allowed to cross the border.
The officials said that foreign governments have recently asked Iran to ease restrictions at the Iran-Iraq border crossings, but that Iran has yet to provide a definite answer.
 
'One-Sided' Relief Effort
 "Their general principle was that they don't want to take in more refugees than they can handle at one time," a Western official said. "We've pressed them on it. At the same time I've felt uncomfortable doing so when the relief effort has been so one-sided to date."
Western officials said they were impressed in visits to the area with Iran's willingness to feed and house the refugees even at the expense of its own population. For example, one official said, leaders in the far northwest province of West Azerbaijan have committed the region's next three months' supply of baby formula to the more than 250,000 refugees staying there.
Elsewhere, both Iran and foreign relief agencies are buying up the stocks of local produce markets, creating local food shortages where none existed before, the officials said.
The International Committee of the Red Cross was reported to have committed about $140 million for refugees in both Iran and Turkey and agencies of the United Nations planned to spend slightly more than $420 million.
Some officials sharply criticized the United Nations, which they said had failed to orchestrate any visible response to the Kurdish refugee crisis until last weekend, when planeloads of supplies began to arrive in two provincial capitals that are refugee centers.
One official said today that United Nations refugee experts predicted that no more than 100,000 refugees would flee Iraq's civil war, and then concentrated their efforts on refugees in Turkey when the exodus began.
 
Supplies Still Scarce
 United Nations officials have said critical goods are still in short supply. Figures circulated by the United Nations here show that the Iranian effort needs 774,000 tents and has acquired only 30,000, and that it needs 1.6 million blankets but has only 440,000.
A Red Cross official said tonight on Iranian television that the agency's resources could handle the needs of only 200,000 of the 1.5 million Kurds who are either in or seeking to enter Iran.
"We need more help," she said.
Most deaths are believed to be occurring among refugees still waiting to enter Iran, officials said. They said Iranian officials have estimated that at least 1,000 refugees are dying daily of malnutrition, exposure and disease. Because no one has been inside Iraq to survey the suffering there, no figures are completely reliable.
Iranian officials also have told Western governments that 350 to 400 deaths among refugees have occurred within Iran. That figure appears low, but independent verification is impossible.
Doctors at refugee camps have told reporters that they are losing as many as a dozen babies daily to infant diarrhea and other diseases, and there are dozens such camps scattered across northwestern Iran.

HEADLINE: AFTER THE WAR: A RISKY UNDERTAKING;
Kurd Relief Plan Takes Bush to the Edge Of the Tangle He Has Tried Hard to Avoid

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSENTHAL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 17

 BODY:
President Bush presented his plan to aid the Kurdish refugees as a straightforward and limited humanitarian operation, but it has raised the possibility of snaring Mr. Bush in just the kind of political and military tangle that he has been trying to avoid.
 Less than a day after the President said he would set up refugee camps in northern Iraq, the United Nations was questioning the legal basis for the effort, which seemed to be predicated on little more than the rights of a conqueror. 
 The White House found itself sidestepping questions about the political future of Iraqi Kurdistan to avoid conflicts with its allies in Turkey, which contains the largest population of Kurds and which has long feared and opposed steps that could encourage any Kurdish separatism.
But, signaling its own awareness that the refugee problem could become political and military dynamite if not properly handled, the White House warned Kurdish opposition groups not to use the proposed refugee camps as a staging area and safe haven for guerrilla bands.
The Bush Administration took pains to reassure the American people that the refugee project was a short-term commitment and that the United States would not be drawn ever deeper into Iraq's tortuous politics.
 
An Unresolved Question
 "We hope and intend to turn them over to the U.N. to administer as soon as possible," Marlin Fitzwater, Mr. Bush's spokesman, said of the camps. "This effort in no way is expected to delay the withdrawal of U.S. forces from the region."
But Administration officials acknowledged that they would have difficulty getting the United Nations Security Council to approve an allied plan for coaxing the refugees to return home and that they had not resolved the far more difficult question of how to protect them from reprisals by President Saddam Hussein if they do go back.
Indeed, there was confusion today about the procedural aspects of Mr. Bush's relief plan. The United Nations Secretary General, Javier Perez de Cuellar, asserted that Iraq must agree to the plan before it could proceed and that it would require a new Security Council vote as well. The White House disputed both points and suggested that it would press Mr. Perez de Cuellar to change his position.
In addition to feeding and clothing Kurdish refugees, the United States and its partners in the operation are likely to find themselves caring for their sick and perhaps even arbitrating their political disputes.
Prominent foreign policy analysts suggested that the President could be moving toward an indefinite commitment to protect the Kurds and direct involvement in determining the shape of Iraq's future political structure.
"We should not delude ourselves that this is something we can do for a month and then walk away," said Henry A. Kissinger, the former Secretary of State.
 
The Role of Hussein
 In outlining its plans for the refugees, the White House has stressed the humanitarian aspects of providing food and clothing and Mr. Bush said he was reasonably confident that Iraq would not attack the planned refugee camps.
But Mr. Bush and his aides acknowledge that the United States, Britain, France and Turkey will have to protect the Kurds from Mr. Hussein's harsh repression as well, and that poses the most risks and long-term problems.
"We can protect these people for a while," said Mr. Kissinger, "but the basic problem will be either to get a government into Baghdad that one can trust enough to treat these Kurds differently than they've been treated for decades or get some kind of international regimen that limits the capacity of the Iraqi Government for repression in the Kurdish area. Either would be a major intervention in what has heretofore been considered the domestic affairs of another country."
Mr. Kissinger said the trouble with trying to provide an international security apparatus for the Kurds in northern Iraq was that such an effort would presume some sort of autonomy for the region. That could put Washington in conflict not only with Turkey, whose Kurdish citizens are already agitating for autonomy, but also with Syria and Iran, which also have Kurdish populations.
Cyrus R. Vance, the former Secretary of State, said he did not think Mr. Bush had any alternative to aiding the refugees.
But he said: "It looks like you're going to end up with a lot of big camps, such as we've seen on the West Bank. Where are you going to have these people go so they don't sit in camps indefinitely? They should go back to their hometowns and cities. But unless you have some kind of assurance that they are going to be protected, it's going to be hard to ask them to go back. And that gets us involved in politics."
An Administration official said Mr. Bush hoped to safeguard the Kurds from Mr. Hussein's forces by continuing his efforts to dismantle Iraq's poison gases and biological weapons and by keeping economic sanctions in place as long as Mr. Hussein is in power.
But there are already signs that the pressure to do more will continue to mount on Mr. Bush, who has already been criticized for urging the Iraqis to overthrow Mr. Hussein and then remaining on the sidelines of the ensuing civil war.
"Once you commit yourself to protecting those people, you are committed until you are sure they are 100 percent safe, and they won't be as long as Saddam Hussein and his regime are in power," said Najmaldin O. Karim, a spokesman for the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan, one of the two largest Iraqi Kurdish groups.
He added, "We hope that this commitment to protect these people is serious and is open-ended."
 
A Plea by Bush
 For the Administration, the simplest solution continues to be the removal of Mr. Hussein. But American officials are no closer now to finding a way to achieve that objective than they were when Mr. Bush halted the fighting on Feb. 27.
Mr. Bush seemed acutely aware of this problem on Tuesday, when he said at a news conference that he might be open to Mr. Hussein taking refuge in another country with guarantees that he never return to Iraq.
"That was a plea: 'Take this problem away,' " one official said.
For weeks, the President has been proclaiming that the successful end to the war to drive Iraq from Kuwait signaled an end to the "Vietnam syndrome."
But it is clear now that he has been defining that generational problem in relatively narrow terms of America's ability to express its national will and is suddenly confronting the broader aspects of the Vietnam legacy: the risks of being drawn into a political quagmire.
"When I first became Secretary of State, I asked the policy planning staff to give me a memorandum on how a great power avoids becoming a satellite of a small country that is completely dependent on you," said Dean Rusk, who was Secretary under John F. Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson. "They didn't come up with a very good answer for a problem that we had in our time and which I'm afraid Bush has now."

HEADLINE: A Meeting Place for Africans and U.S. Blacks

BYLINE: By KENNETH B. NOBLE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ABIDJAN, Ivory Coast, April 17

 BODY:
Many black Americans, says the Rev. Leon H. Sullivan, have long been ashamed of Africa and their African heritage, an attitude he is determined to confront at a conference of black Americans and Africans he has invited here for four days this week.
"Psychologically, we've been brainwashed to believe that Africa was the dark continent, a place of crocodiles, trees and Tarzan," said the 68-year-old civil rights leader, a retired Baptist minister from Philadelphia, as he sat in his suite at the Hotel Ivoire Inter-Continental here today and described how he came to organize the "first African, African-American summit." 
 By all accounts the conference, which includes religious and civil rights advocates, academics, entertainers, members of Congress and businessmen, as well as government leaders and prominent figures from a number of African countries. is the largest of its kind ever held.
Mr. Sullivan, who is also a director of the General Motors Corporation, said he hopes the conference will both encourage black Americans to discover their rich African heritage and stimulate support for African economic development at a time when interest in the continent appears to be waning.
"Africa is the forgotten continent," Mr. Sullivan said. "You have the focus being on Eastern Europe, and more recently the Persian Gulf," and because of this, he said, the continent is increasingly seen as a "place not that important to the economic future of the world."
 
Building Connections to Africa
 One means of addressing this problem, Mr. Sullivan said, is to strengthen the involvement of black Americans in the affairs of Africa. He hopes to build the kind of of attachments "that the Irish have with Ireland, the Jew with Israel and the Poles with Poland" -- ties that have often translated into economic and political muscle.
Mr. Sullivan is perhaps best known for devising a code of conduct for American corporations doing business in South Africa in 1977. More recently, he has been at the forefront of those who have encouraged corporations and other businesses to divest themselves of South African financial links.
Asked about the decision this week by the European Community to lift most trade sanctions against the Pretoria Government, Mr. Sullivan said this would be one of the major topics of discussion here in conference sessions involving African heads of government.
"I still hold my 1987 position," Mr. Sullivan said. "I said then until Mandela's free, until statutory apartheid is ended as a system, and until there is a clear commitment of equal voting rights, sanctions should stay on."
Another issue on the agenda, he said, is debt relief. He cited a recent American decision to cancel as much as 70 percent of Poland's debt as something that African governments should also be pushing for.
"Africa is paralyzed with the burden of massive debt, over $100 billion," he said, "and there's no way that these countries can reach their potential as long as they're facing that."
Mr. Sullivan sees the conference as something of a launching pad to stimulate greater exchanges between American blacks and Africans. "The summit is only the setting of the stage for the future," he said. For example, he hopes to create hundreds of African Support Committees, which will will help generate ideas and create something akin to the Peace Corps.
"I envision the best and the brightest professionals," he said, "giving a year, like the old Mormons, to work with Africa."
Among those expected to attend the conference are Benjamin Hooks, executive director of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, the Rev. Joseph Lowery, president of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference; the Rev. Jesse Jackson, and a delegation of black members of Congress led by Representative William H. Gray 3d, Democrat of Pennsylvania and House majority whip, who will give the keynonte address.
African leaders attending include President Felix Houphouet-Boigny of the Ivory Coast, President Ibrahim Babangida of Nigeria, President Abdou Diouf of Senegal and President Yoweri K. Museveni of Uganda.

HEADLINE: Dinkins and Fiscal Pain;
Distaste for Confrontation Has Cost Mayor Room to Maneuver in City's Budget Crisis

BYLINE: By TODD S. PURDUM

 BODY:
By adopting an approach to New York City's fiscal problems that strived to inflict the least pain possible, Mayor David N. Dinkins has lost room to maneuver, his own aides concede, and all but assured great pain in the face of the crisis he now confronts.
 Since the current city budget was adopted in July, the Dinkins administration has lifted a freeze on hiring city workers, then reimposed it. It has won special taxes to hire thousands of police officers whose hiring some city officials now wish they could delay. It has granted raises, then threatened layoffs and then avoided most of the layoffs through wage deferrals that will ultimately cost more. 
 Each of those decisions met the problems of the moment, and Mr. Dinkins had understandable political and practical reasons for making them as he struggled to balance the concerns of his contending constituencies and make his mark on a government he had just inherited.
"I'm sure that there are things that we might have done differently," Mr. Dinkins said this week. "I'm not prepared to enumerate. I don't mean that I know and don't want to tell you. But I mean I'm a bit busy trying to handle things day to day."
But in hindsight the policy twists and turns loom large, and they raise questions of whether Mr. Dinkins should have done more sooner, or at least done all he has said he would do when he said he would do it. Just a month ago, he vowed unequivocally that the city would seek major money-saving concessions from its union work force. But in a pattern that has persisted, his oratory has produced no discernible progress and both sides remain mired in defining the problem.
In an effort to break the stalemate in the city's budget crisis -- a $465 million gap in the city's current budget, half of which the city does not know how it will fill -- Mr. Dinkins has scheduled a meeting with Gov. Mario M. Cuomo today in which he plans to ask for immediate help in getting several hundred million dollars of one-time revenues through state authorities and corporations.
No one in or out of government fully predicted the steep unexpected declines in tax revenues that have left the city staring at a current budget gap that it has just weeks to close to avoid the grip of the State Financial Control Board.
The board could reimpose binding powers on city spending if the city ended the fiscal year on June 30 with a deficit of $100 million or more.
Indeed, the control board said early last month that there was little doubt the city could balance its budget for the current year and that a bigger problem was how to close a $3 billion gap for the next fiscal year and assure balanced budgets for years to come.
But fiscal monitors and even some mayoral aides say the city has lagged perpetually behind the bad news at least in part because the Mayor has chosen to address it one step at a time, never anticipating that the worst could come to pass nor consistently following through on his own proposed solutions.
 
'Lots of Talk'
 "There's lots of talk, but where's the action?" said Allen J. Proctor, executive director of the Financial Control Board, which was set up to monitor the city's finances in the fiscal crisis of the mid-1970's. "There's a lot of talk, but everything seems to kind of disappear. Now they have a two-week window at the maximum."
Or as one senior mayoral aide, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, put it: "Is this a crisis or not? If it's a crisis, then act like it's a crisis."
Mr. Dinkins now seems to have worn down the good will of allies and critics alike at the very moment he needs them most.
Labor negotiations are stalled, the Mayor's own commissioners have resisted his budget-cutting requests and the Governor and the Legislature -- not bound by the strict laws and scrutiny that apply to the city -- are already two weeks late in closing a $6 billion deficit in the state budget.
Not all the problems are of Mr. Dinkins's making. Union leaders' resistance to concessions owes as much to Mr. Cuomo's insistence that they make givebacks before he will even consider helping the city with one-time financing maneuvers, and the economy is no one's to control. The state's own problems have forced Mr. Cuomo to propose cutting $600 million in aid to the city.
But a complex combination of factors has nonetheless produced a yearlong deadlock at City Hall. They range from Mr. Dinkins's innate distrust of the city's budget office (a legacy of his days as Manhattan borough president, when he thought it was hiding money) to his struggle to balance the needs of his constituencies (especially the municipal unions that played a major role in his election) to tension and turmoil among his own top staff members.
"You have a philosophy and a set of policy options that are contradictory," said Felix G. Rohatyn, the chairman of the Municipal Assistance Corporation and an architect of the plan that bailed the city out of the fiscal crisis of the 1970's. "The heart is always trying to minimize the pain and avoid layoffs, and the head is always trying to maintain the credit rating and fiscal stability and the city's tax base.
"And because both of these strains run very deep in City Hall, they result in paralysis. They keep canceling each other out."
One of the Mayor's senior business advisers, speaking on the condition of anonymity, put the problem another way: "There is a very basic type of management. People agree to do something. Then they get back together and say, 'Where do we stand?' That's follow-up. You have to have both a will to follow up and a procedure, and I think both are lacking here in terms of the Mayor's distaste for confrontation."
 
A Freeze That Melted
 Internal debates within the administration have gone on since before the current budget was adopted last July. At that time, the new administration lifted a partial hiring freeze imposed months earlier, though some mayoral aides objected.
That decision meant the city work force increased by about 1,000 workers a month, or 4,000 workers, until the freeze was reimposed in October. By last month, the work force had only shrunk back to where it was when the freeze was lifted, or about 243,000.
Pressured by complaints about his handling of a spate of sensational crimes, Mr. Dinkins proposed in October, again against some top aides' advice, to hire thousands of new police officers by using special new taxes designated for that purpose, thus reducing the potential tax pool for the city's general needs. After bruising fights with the City Council and the Legislature, the taxes were passed, but with the provision that the city would lose the right to the money to the degree that it did not meet hiring goals.
Some of the Mayor's advisers are urging that the city reconsider whether it can still afford to hire the officers on time. The city's Budget Director, Philip R. Michael, said no such proposal had been made to the Mayor, though it has been debated within the budget office.
"With dedicated funds, you eventually get to the point where you can define yourself out of solutions," he said.
Though what will happen next remains unclear, the ticking time clock means something must.
"You have to get ahead of the game, and that means very often you have to take action before you're satisfied that you have all the facts that you want," Mr. Rohatyn said. "The choice is not really between doing right and doing wrong. The choice is between doing something and doing nothing, and doing nothing never gets you anyplace."

HEADLINE: Chamorro Wins Bush Promise on Debt

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 17

 BODY:
In an endorsement of Nicaragua's new austerity policies, President Bush pledged today to President Violeta Barrios de Chamorro that he would lead an international effort to help the country clear $360 million in overdue payments on its crushing debt.
Administration officials said that while Mr. Bush did not offer her any new aid, he did promise that the United States might augment its previous pledge of $50 million in debt relief if Managua needed it later this year. Mrs. Chamorro and her aides expressed great satisfaction with the White House meeting, saying Mr. Bush's efforts would soon open the way for the first payments on Nicaragua's $9.5 billion debt since 1984. 
 In the first state visit to the White House by a Nicaraguan President since 1939, Mrs. Chamorro was received with full military honors and warm embraces on the South Lawn by several of the Administration's most senior officials, including Vice President Dan Quayle; the national security adviser. Brent Scowcroft, and Gen. Colin L. Powell, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
Mr. Bush heaped praise on her in a speech that referred to Nicaragua's most cherished poets and adoration of the Virgin Mary, as well as the recent civil war fought between the United States-financed contras and the Sandinistas who proceeded her in power.
 
'Exhilarating Victory'
 Referring to her inauguration almost exactly a year ago, Mr. Bush said, "In you we saw the exhilarating victory of democracy, of that glorious new breeze that in one amazing year swept out oppression and dictatorship from Prague to Managua."
Mrs. Chamorro replied that she hoped this day would represent a turning point in a relationship that went from subservience during four decades of the Somoza family dictatorship to 11 years of confrontation ending with her February 1990 electoral defeat of the Sandinista President, Daniel Ortega Saavedra. "It is our responsibility," she said, "to begin fertilizing the seed of a new friendship, a friendship based on our shared belief in democracy and mutual respect."
After the ceremony, Mr. Bush and Mrs. Chamorro met privately in the Oval Office for 15 minutes followed by an expanded meeting including Cabinet members for 45 minutes more. The leaders brushed aside a number of issues that have caused difficulties between the two Governments, including the continued control of the army and security forces by the Sandinistas, and concentrated on economic issues.
 
'Together We Will Do It'
 Bernard W. Aronson, Assistant Secretary of State for Inter-American Affairs, said Mr. Bush promised Mrs. Chamorro that along with the World Bank, the United States "will lead an international effort" to help Nicaragua "clear its arrears and normalize its relations with the international financial institutions." He quoted Mr. Bush as saying, "One way or another together we will do it."
The United States has pledged $541 million for Nicaragua since Mrs. Chamorro's election, but only about $207 million has been disbursed. It has conditioned its aid on banking reform and privatization of the economy.
Mrs. Chamorro announced an austerity program on March 3 that drastically devalued the currency, cut back bank lending, and decreased real wages among state workers.

HEADLINE: Price of Aid for Egypt Is a Dose of Economic Pain

BYLINE: By YOUSSEF M. IBRAHIM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CAIRO, April 17

 BODY:
As the echoes of the Persian Gulf war fade, Egypt's huge economic problems are returning to top the list of this country's principal concerns. The situation is likely to be tougher than many Egyptians expected because there are indications that the rich Arab countries of the gulf -- Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and other emirates -- will not be as generous as their promises indicated.
The Arab countries have already written off some $7 billion in debt owed them by Egypt, and the United States has written off a similar amount of military debts, but the interest burden on the remaining debt is sapping Egypt's already fragile economy. 
 Last week Egypt signed a preliminary accord with the International Monetary Fund after three years of wrenching negotiations to ease its $40 billion foreign debt. The United States played a key role behind the scenes in winning that help for Egypt, in part to reward the country for its role in the gulf war. But the price for that help is that Egypt put economic reforms in place. The changes can only add to the cost of living, which is already rising at an unofficial rate that tops 25 percent a year.
The I.M.F. accord, assuming it wins board approval in May, could lead to rescheduling of Egypt's remaining debts and canceling of about 30 percent of them. But the country's leadership is cautioning the population that the required economic changes will further test the patience of consumers. They will see steep rises in the prices of electricity, gasoline, refined oil products and essential food like bread and meat, which will be eased out of the long list of subsidized goods.
 
Signaled Bad News
 President Hosni Mubarak began to signal the bad news at the end of March, when he told major newspapers in a string of interviews that billions of dollars in interest-free financial aid from the Arabs might not be forthcoming as a reward for Egypt's participation in the alliance that freed Kuwait of Iraqi occupation.
"The gulf crisis does not mean cash will start flowing to us from every direction, and there will be prosperity," the Egyptian leader said. "There is no prosperity in the whole world. If we want to live an honorable life, we must not rely on the outside to provide our food."
The situation will be particularly difficult because of the relentless population increase here. Egypt's has 55 million people now and is growing at the rate of a million every nine months.
President Mubarak's interviews dashed expectations that the oil-rich Arab countries were considering a plan to purchase Egypt's debt from creditors and ease the repayment terms.
These developments are of great importance beyond Egypt. Many political analysts say that the country cannot play a leading role in stabilizing the Middle East, while servicing its debt and struggling to develop new jobs and a bigger economy.
President Mubarak said Egypt had already benefited from the United States' decision to wipe out some $7 billion of its military debts and from a similar decision by Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates and Qatar to forgive $6 billion in debts. But Mr. Mubarak said the forgiven debt did not balance the $20 billion Egypt lost as a result of the gulf war.
He said that 700,000 Egyptians who worked in Iraq and Kuwait had returned jobless and without their savings, and Egypt's Petroleum Minister, Abdelhadi Kandil, said that Egypt's revenues from oil exports had dropped to $1.5 billion from $3 billion in 1982 because of increased consumption by Egypt's growing population. In addition, Egypt has lost billions of dollars from the drop in tourism and Suez Canal revenues during the gulf crisis.
 
Idle Labor Force
 On top of this, various other senior officials are making clear that Arab gulf countries will not open their doors to Eqypt's big idled labor force. Egypt has increasingly depended on the export of laborers to neighboring countries.
Nearly two million Egyptian expatriates were in Iraq and Kuwait, sending at least $3 billion home to their families in Egypt every year. This badly needed infusion of hard currency appears now to be gone, and Kuwait has a long way to go before it begins to recontruct its economy.
Two weeks ago, the acting Kuwaiti Planning Minister, Suleiman al-Mutawa, was quoted by Egyptian newspapers as saying that Kuwait is intent on lowering the number of expatriates in the country so that Kuwaitis will not again be a minority in their own country. Furthermore, he said, many of the old jobs may no longer exist.
 
Outnumbered the Kuwaitis
 Before the Iraqi invasion, there were 700,000 Kuwaitis living in Kuwait and about 1.2 million foreigners, including 450,000 Palestinians and at least 300,000 Egyptians.
Although Government-owned newspapers have avoided linking I.M.F.-induced economic strictures to higher prices, most Egyptians have learned to watch the dropping value of the Egyptian pound against the dollar. They take it as a sign that prices of all imports, including essential ingredients like wheat, will go up.
Last week, most Egyptians who have seen the value of the dollar leap from nearly two pounds to more than three pounds over the last few years, were speculating that by the end of the year the American dollar would hit a peak of four pounds to the dollar.

HEADLINE: Mexico Proclaims an End To Sanctuary for Polluters

BYLINE: By ROBERT REINHOLD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: EL MONTE, Calif., April 17

 BODY:
Amid growing concern that a proposed North American free-trade agreement might undermine United States pollution controls, top environmental officials from Mexico assured California officials today that American companies would find no sanctuary south of the border.
"That was something conceivable four or five years ago when we did not have the contacts and information we have now," said the spokesman for the Mexican delegation, Fernando Menendez Garza, the air pollution coordinator for Mayor Manuel Camacho of Mexico City. 
 Mr. Menendez said that enforcement had increased at least five-fold in the last two years and that any company seeking to relocate to Mexico would be told that it would have to comply with emission standards at least as strict as where it came from.
In the past, environmentalists have been skeptical of such promises from the Mexicans, citing lack of monitoring and shortage of enforcement personnel, as well as official corruption. Numermous companies operating in several countries make products in Mexico with ingredients and packaging materials that could not be made in the United States.
A representative of the Environmental Protection Agency, William L. Jones, told the gathering in this Los Angeles suburb that the agency and its Mexican counterpart, the Ministry of Urban Development and Environment, were developing an "integrated border environment plan." He said the plan would be aimed at assessing the environmental risks posed by the 1,886 plants along the border at which products are assembled and shipped back to the United Sttes.
Mr. Menendez was part of a 12-man Mexican delegation that came for a three-day workshop here to obtain advice from American officials and work on harmonizing pollution standards. They met with leaders of the South Coast Air Quality Management District, the California Air Resources Board and the Environmental Protection Agency, as well as the World Bank. The air quality district is the powerful state agency that two years ago imposed a stringent smog-control plan on a 6,000 square-mile area that includes Los Angeles, Ventura and Orange Counties and parts of San Bernardino and Riverside Counties.
 
Reports of Company Relocations
 There have been news reports that a number of companies, mainly furniture manufacturers, have relocated in Mexico from the Los Angeles area to escape new emission controls on solvents.
"If they have gotten away, they are only postponing the day of reckoning for a year or two," Mr. Menendez said in an interview.
The smog authorities in California said they believed the Mexicans were serious now. "These guys are tough," said Henry W. Wedaa, an Orange County Supervisor who is vice chairman of the board of the air quality district. "Anybody who moves to Mexico is in for a rude response.
Edward Camarena, deputy executive officer of the district, said: "They don't want American companies dumping pollution on their citizens. They made that very clear."
The session came amid intensifying debate over the proposed free-trade agreement, which would drastically limit tariffs between the two countries.
Among many objections raised to the accord, environmentalists and their allies in Congress fear that Mexico's environmental standards could be an attraction to American companies seeking to reduce their costs. President Carlos Salinas de Gortari of Mexico traveled through the United States last week trying to address such concerns.
The Mexican delegation included representatives of the government of Mexico City, the Federal enclave of 15 million population that has about the worst air pollution in the world; the Ministry of Urban Development and Environment; Pemex, the state-owned oil monopoly; the Mexican Petroleum Institute; the state of Mexico, and the Ministry of Health.
As evidence of the Mexican Government's new commitment to environmental protection, Mr. Menendez named several recent actions: the shutting of Mexico City's giant Azcapotzalco refinery; the passage of a new Constitutional Law for the Ecological Equilibrium and Protection of the Environment; a 650 percent growth in enforcement efforts in the last two years; a plan to replace all buses, taxis and public-service vans with vehicles that meet strict California emission standards; the introduction of unleaded gasoline nationwide, and the planting of 1.8 million trees in Mexico City.
"We are here because we want to do things," he told the session. "Our president is committed to a cleaner environment in the rest of the country as well as Mexico City."
As for the free-trade pact, Mr. Menendez said the country's goal was not to attract polluting industries but to use the free-trade agreement to substitute clean industries for dirty ones.
While there have been no reliable comprehensive data, according to news reports in Southern California about 40 furniture makers have relocated pat or all of the operations to Mexico since 1988 to avoid the air-quality district's rule that requires the use of low-emission paints, varnishes and solvents.
District officials said that they did not think many companies were moving for such reasons. Mr. Jones of the E.P.A. agreed with Mexican officials that there was less of an economic reason for such a move, apart from cheaper labor.

HEADLINE: NCNB and First Interstate Report Lower Profits

BYLINE: By MICHAEL QUINT

 BODY:
The NCNB Corporation, the nation's eighth-largest banking company, said yesterday that its first-quarter profits fell 8.4 percent because of problems with bad loans.
NCNB's loan problems were partly offset by the benefits of lower interest rates, which enabled the company to earn large profits on its bond investments and reduce the rates it paid to depositors. 
 The First Interstate Bancorp, the nation's 11th-largest banking company, which reported a 38.6 percent decline in profits from a year earlier, also felt the effects of bad loans. The decline excludes the effect of an accounting change in 1990.
In contrast, the Fleet/Norstar Financial Group, a Northeastern banking company, reported a turnaround in the quarter, posting a profit. It had a loss a year earlier.
Following are details of the banking companies' results:
 
NCNB
NCNB reported first-quarter earnings of $128.4 million, or $1.20 a share, down from $140.1 million, or $1.33 a share a year earlier.
The Charlotte, N.C., company's holdings of nonperforming loans, those that are badly delinquent or not expected to be repaid in full, plus real estate acquired from bad loans, rose $84.8 million in the first quarter, to $1.033 billion. About $83.4 million of loans were written off as a loss. At the same time, $70.7 million was set aside in the reserve for future loan losses.
NCNB, whose $17.6 billion bond portfolio is second only to J. P. Morgan & Company's, earned a profit of $66.6 million after taxes by selling some securities at a profit and reinvesting the proceeds in new securities with shorter maturities.
The bond portfolio was bought primarily with deposits that NCNB has collected in Texas since its 1988 acquisition of First Republicbank of Dallas.
Russell J. Page, a spokesman for NCNB, said the market value of the bond portfolio was about $150 million greater than the amount shown on the company's books, even after the gains taken in the first quarter. During the first quarter of this year, short-term interest rates continued to decline, raising the price of NCNB's holdings enough that the company earned a profit by selling some securities.
Falling interest rates also helped the company by enabling it to reduce the rates it paid on deposits. Deposit rates fell more quickly than the rates it charged on loans and investments.
NCNB's shares gained $1.75 after the earnings announcement yesterday, to close at $39 on the New York Stock Exchange.
 
First Interstate
First Interstate said its 38.6 percent decline in profits excluded the effect of an accounting change that increased last year's profits. The Los Angeles-based company had warned analysts that growing problems with bad loans would keep 1991 earnings below 1990 levels.
The company's first-quarter profits of $59.6 million, or 81 cents a share, were down from $127.2 million, or $2.23 a share, a year earlier. The profit for the quarter last year included $30.1 million, or 57 cents a share, for an accounting change.
Edward M. Carson, First Interstate's chairman, noted that the drop in profits reflected decreased loan demand and weakness in real estate markets in California and elsewhere. Nonperforming loans and real estate owned as a result of foreclosure rose $40 million from year-end, to $1.789 billion. Of the total, about 75 percent are real estate related.
The company charged off as a loss $126.9 million in the first quarer, down from $198.1 million a year earlier. It added $135.2 million to its reserve for future loan losses, compared with $91.8 million a year earlier.
First Interstate said efforts to reduce costs were hurt by a $34.3 million increase in expenses associated with operating real estate acquired though foreclosure and a $7.2 million increase in Federal deposit insurance premiums. Over all, its non-interest expenses rose $44.6 million, or 7.2 percent.
The company's shares gained $1.50 yesterday, closing at $36.
 
Fleet/Norstar
Fleet/Norstar, based in Providence, R.I., reported earnings of $25.5 million, or 21 cents a share, in contrast to a loss a year earlier of $98.1 million.
While Fleet continues to suffer from the ill effects of the downturn in the Northeastern regional economy, there are signs that the problems are becoming less severe. The company noted that the pace of deterioration in the region was slowing as nonperforming assets increased $63 million, to $1.44 billion, the smallest increase since the third quarter of 1989.
In the first quarter, Fleet benefited from the diversity of its business. The financial services group, which operates nationally in mortgage lending, consumer finance and some lending, earned $37 million, up more than 50 percent from a year earlier, while its four New York banks earned $20 million, up from $5 million a year earlier. The company's five banks in New England lost $111 million, down from a $115 million loss a year earlier.
Fleet/Norstar's stock picked up 75 cents yesterday, closing at $18.125.

HEADLINE: American Air's Parent Posts $195.6 Million Loss

BYLINE: By THOMAS C. HAYES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DALLAS, April 17

 BODY:
The AMR Corporation, parent company of American Airlines, said it lost $195.6 million in the first quarter, with the weak economy and war-related travel worries cutting passenger loads. Squabbles with its pilots' union, route changes and higher prices for aviation fuel also contributed to the deficit.
Industry analysts said American's huge loss reflected continuing turmoil in the airline industry, which lost $2 billion from operations in the last quarter of 1990. The industry's first-quarter losses will probably exceed $1.5 billion, analysts said, although prospects appear to be improving. 
 Kevin C. Murphy, an airline analyst at Morgan Stanley & Company, in New York, said American's deficit was smaller than expected. He said declining costs and rising passenger loads should enable American to earn a profit in the current quarter.
 
'It's Going to Get Better'
 American and a few other carriers, including Delta Air Lines and United Airlines, should recover significantly by the end of the year to earn a small profit for 1991 perhaps, if current trends hold, said Daniel M. Kasper, an industry adviser at Harbridge House, consultants in Boston.
"It's going to get better as the year goes along," he said.
But financially weak carriers like Trans World Airlines and others in bankruptcy, including Continental and Pan American World Airways, will continue to struggle. Airline travel was down 11.2 percent for domestic-based carriers in March from last year, according to the Air Transport Association, a trade group in Washington.
American said its revenues rose by 3 percent in the quarter, to $2.77 billion, from $2.69 billion in the first quarter last year. The airline lost $19.3 million in the corresponding quarter last year. Operating expenses rose by 11 percent, to $3.01 billion from $2.70 billion, because of the airline's growth and higher fuel costs. American added 18 aircraft in the quarter, raising its fleet to 570 planes.
American's loss was the second worst in its history, after the $215.1 million deficit in the fourth quarter. Robert L. Crandall, AMR's chairman and chief executive, said the performance was terrible, but added that declines in costs for jet fuel and improving passenger sales in March were signs of a turnaround.
Jet fuel costs slipped to an average of 82 cents a gallon in the first quarter from $1.13 a gallon in the fourth quarter. The airline's average jet-fuel cost for April was 55.5 cents a gallon through today.
If the fuel-cost average holds near 60 cents through June, as American anticipates, the airline's fuel expense for the current quarter would drop by about $150 million from the first-quarter figure. American has more than 2,000 daily flights and uses 220 million gallons of jet fuel each month.
The airline faced other unusual costs in the quarter. It scaled back its flight schedule by 4 percent in January as the threat of a pilots' strike mounted, then moved to restore the flights after the pilots agreed to new contract terms in February.
 
Absence of Pilots
 The schedule was further complicated by the absence of as many as 450 pilots on military duty during the war in the Persian Gulf. About 50 have been released from active duty, but the airline is unsure when the others will return, said Andrea Rader, a spokeswoman.
The airline said it sold an average of 57 percent of available seats on all flights during the quarter, but that it needed a level of 63 percent to earn a profit because of higher costs. The break-even point in the corresponding quarter last year was 60 percent.

HEADLINE: Rich's Plans To Close Its Main Store

BYLINE: By ISADORE BARMASH

 BODY:
Rich's Inc., a landmark in downtown Atlanta for more than a century, announced yesterday that it would close the huge store on July 13 after five years of continuing losses.
The announcement at 5 P.M. surprised the store staff, competitors and the public. Many had assumed that Rich's would stay put in its flagship location because of its participation in local affairs and continue its brisk competition with Macy's, its rival downtown. 
 Rich's is one of nine store divisions of Federated Stores Inc., which filed for protection from its creditors under Chapter 11 of the Federal Bankruptcy Code in January 1990. The company also owns Bloomingdale's and Abraham & Straus in New York, Jordan Marsh in Boston and Miami, Burdines in Florida, Lazarus in Ohio and the Bon Marche in Seattle. The divisions have also been in Chapter 11 bankruptcy.
 
A Trend in Retailing
 The 13 Rich's suburban stores will stay open after the downtown flagship is closed, a Rich's statement said, and the 242 full-time and part-time employees in the main store will be offered jobs in the branches. Rich's owns both the store property and the land on which it is situated, according to Federated in Cincinnati.
The closing of the Rich's main store continues a trend in big cities.
"The continuing decline in sales in our downtown store, in stark contrast to our success in other locations, has forced us to make this difficult but basic business decision," said Roger Farah, Rich's chairman and chief executive.
He said Rich's had postponed the decision for several years to "lend support to fledgling downtown development initiatives and the city's effort to stabilize the downtown business district."
Company officials also said Rich's had hoped that business would return with the opening of Underground Atlanta, a retail and entertainment complex, but the success of the civic project failed to help the retailer.
 
Pink Pigs and Easy Returns
 For decades, the store lighted a Christmas tree on Thanksgiving night and gave children rides through the store on a miniature train with cars shaped like pink pigs. It offered customers an extremely liberal policy on returns, and its closing will be felt far beyond the loss of sales.
Judith Webb, a native of Atlanta and an employee of the Chamber of Commerce, said: "I got my wedding dress at Rich's; I got my first prom dress at Rich's. I have amazing memories of coming downtown as a little child, riding the pink pig and getting all my school clothes. It's a sad thing."
Rich's spent $9 million in 1985 to renovate the downtown store but customer traffic and sales continued to decline, Mr. Farah said. Profits in the location averaged $5 million to $6 million below the level needed to keep the store open. But sales at the downtown store represent only 3.7 percent of Rich's total 1990 sales of $824 million.
In 1988, Federated merged its Goldsmith stores into Rich's and a headquarters staff was maintained for the combined group in the downtown Atlanta store. That staff of 900, which includes buying, merchandising, marketing, finance and accounting executives and associates, will remain in the building for the time being.

HEADLINE: U.S. Trade Panel Recommends Sanctions Against Japan

BYLINE: By CLYDE H. FARNSWORTH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 17

 BODY:
A long-smoldering trade dispute with Japan has heated up, with the Bush Administration's interagency Trade Policy Group recommending retaliation for Tokyo's failure to open more public works construction to American companies, like a new airport for Osaka, Administration officials said today.
But Japanese officials said Tokyo had decided to send a negotiating team to Washington within a week to try to resolve the conflict before a May 1 deadline for introducing the sanctions. 
 "We have indicated that we will be responding positively" to some of the United States concerns, said Hiroshi Hirabayashi, the economics minister at the Japanese Embassy here.
 
Warning Made
 At the same time, he warned that if the United States resorted to sanctions, Japan would suspend concessions already made that have led to $310 million worth of Japanese contracts to American construction companies since mid-1988.
"We will be offering the maximum we can without prejudicing our basic position," Mr. Hirabayashi said in an interview.
The Trade Policy Group, representing sub-Cabinet officials from agencies and departments with trade responsibility, unanimously recommended sanctions at a meeting on Friday. The sanctions would involve steps to keep Japanese construction companies from wining American public works contracts.
But Administration officials stressed that the Cabinet and the President still had to approve any action, which would be the first ordered by the White House against Japan since 1987 and signal a significant change in the Washington's policy toward Tokyo.
 
Fewer Disputes Than in Past
 Although trade disputes still overshadow the relationship, there now are somewhat fewer than in past years, and the trade deficit with Japan has been declining -- factors that have led the Administration to maintain that the overall trade relationship with Japan is improving.
That was the tenor of a meeting earlier this month in California between President Bush and Japan's Prime Minister, Toshiki Kaifu. The only mention of construction came in a statement by President Bush at the end of the meeting, in which he cited some of the more acute bilateral problems.
Chiefly because of the May 1 deadline mandated by trade legislation, the Japanese practice of excluding foreigners from work on billions of dollars worth of construction on bridges, airports, highways, telecommunications and other projects has again come under attack.
The construction issue has come to a head as the United States is also pressing Japan to improve market access in computer chips, auto parts and telecommuncations and to end a ban on imports of rice.
On construction, Washington wants to expand the scope of coverage of a 1988 Major Projects Agreement between the countries that identified 14, later expanded to 17, projects valued at $23 billion for special foreign bidding.
American officials say they want a commitment by the Japanese to open their entire construction market as a matter of principle. They also want the Japanese to acknowledge that American companies have an interest in certain categories of projects, like airports.
American officials say the retaliation will not take place if the United States trade representative, Carla A. Hills, can certify by the end of April that the Japanese have taken steps to open their markets.

HEADLINE: Weicker and Labor Unions Reach an Accord

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HARTFORD, April 17

 BODY:
Gov. Lowell P. Weicker Jr. said today that he and state labor unions had agreed on $327.7 million in labor concessions to help ease Connecticut's budget crisis, averting 2,600 layoffs that began to take effect this week.
It was clear from the opening moments of the news conference announcing the agreement that Mr. Weicker had gained a loud and enthusiastic voice on behalf of the sweeping budget overhaul and income-tax plan that is before the General Assembly. 
 The chief negotiator for the unions, Robert J. Krzys, linked the agreement to union support for a "fair budget and tax reform," and urged state workers to support Mr. Weicker's budget at a rally next week at the Capitol.
Mr. Weicker, in turn, praised the unions as being "the first ones to respond to Connecticut's economic winter." He said that the spending cuts agreed to by the unions are real and painful and "will come out of their pockets as employees and taxpayers."
Mr. Weicker said the first wave of employees who lost their jobs, on Tuesday, would be recalled. But he would not disclose any details of the labor agreement, which was reached this morning. In interviews with labor leaders, lawmakers and administration officials, however, the pact emerged as containing mostly short- or medium-term savings that the state will have to make up in future years.
One of the demands earlier identified by Mr. Weicker as a pivotal benefit reduction, for example -- that Connecticut's 52,000 employees be required to pay a greater proportion of their health care benefits -- was apparently dropped entirely. The state also pledged in writing to avoid any layoffs in the year that begins July 1 other than 938 positions already identified in Mr. Weicker's initial budget plan.
Even if Connecticut's budget and economy continues to deteriorate, the document says, further spending cuts "will not result in loss of employment." Instead, Mr. Weicker promised to transfer, reassign or retrain workers if their jobs have to be eliminated, the officials said. Most of the provisions require approval by union rank and file members, and by the General Assembly, and some lawmakers said today they were already troubled.
The single largest element of the package, which involves stretching out the state's payment schedule to the employee pension plan, is clearly of the category to be borne by taxpayers, whether they work for the state or not. The pension change accounts for $190 million of the projected $327.7 million in savings in the next year, and payments would also be reduced in the next two years after that. But those reduced payments would have to be made up over the 32-year life of the pension plan.
The unions also agreed to a pay raise deferral, under which raises promised for July 1 would be delayed for 11 months, until June 26, 1992. The next raise after that for most employees would come 11 months after that, on May 14, 1993. The compromise gives union members an annual pay increase that will still take effect in the next fiscal year. But by delaying the raises and thus paying the higher wages for a shorter period of time, the state will save about $84 million.
Approximately $48 million is expected to be saved by changing the way the state runs its health-benefits program. But the projected savings, from increases in competitive bidding, and direct state management of the payment system, will not come from state employee's hides. Benefits were pledged to remain intact, labor leaders and administration officials said.
The Governor also said he needed $400 million from the unions as their contribution to resolving Connecticut's huge projected tax-revenue shortfall. He declined to say today exactly where else he might go in the budget to obtain the nearly $73 million not conceded by the unions, although he said that a nonunion pay freeze and furlough program for state managers would contribute.

HEADLINE: Congress Votes to Halt Rail Strike Hours After Thousands Walk Off Job

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Thursday, April 18

 BODY:
Congress approved a joint resolution late Wednesday to halt the national railroad strike less than 24 hours after it began. President Bush signed the legislation early this morning.
After day and night negotiations involving lawmakers and Administration officials, the House of Representatives moved with unusual speed to draft and then pass the measure a 400-to-5 vote. Minutes later, shortly after 11 P.M., the Senate approved the resolution without a roll call vote. 
 Mr. Bush signed the bill at 1:39 A.M. after being awakened in the residential quarters of the White House, a spokesman said. The President was expected to issue a statement later today.
Samuel K. Skinner, the Transportation Secretary, said Mr. Bush had asked that he be awakened to sign the measure, which would immediately send the strikers back to work. Mr. Skinner called the measure "a resolution everyone can live with."
The unions have said they would abide by the legislation.
The walkout early Wednesday against freight railroads throughout the United States stopped movement of much of the nation's coal, grain, automobile parts and many other goods.
Except for a few small regional railroads, all freight traffic stopped moving soon after 7 A.M. as a result of the first nationwide rail strike since a four-day walkout in 1982.
The nation's railroads carry 37 percent of all freight. Trucks carry 25 percent.
 
Quick Action Shows Importance
 Mr. Skinner added that the swift action by Congress was "an indication of just how important this issue is, how important it is to the economy."
The legislation creates a board that will have 65 days to resolve issues remaining in the dispute. If the strike is not settled in that time, the recommendations of a Presidential emergency board that issued a report in January will take effect.
There was relatively little partisan rancor in the closed negotiations, participants said, out of concern that the strike be resolved quickly. Several lawmakers noted Wednesday that each hour the strike continued would be devastating not only to the rail industry but also to the American economy.
"This means the strike is over," proclaimed Representative Al Swift, a Washington Democrat who leads a transportation subcommittee of the Energy and Commerce Committee that drafted the legislation. He added that he had "never seen an issue resolved with so little partisan politics."
Senator Edward M. Kennedy, a Massachusetts Democrat and chairman of the Labor and Human Resources Committee, said, "This accord is good for labor, good for business, good for the economy and good for the nation, and I look forward to its implementation."
By appointing a new board, lawmakers insisted that they were not rejecting the findings of the Presidential emergency board. They said they were particularly concerned that the new panel clarify unresolved issues, like disputes over work rules.
While the Railway Labor Act of 1926 does not expressly create a role for Congress in rail disputes, Congress since 1963 has intervened in at least 11 strikes that threatened grave disruptions to the economy. Lawmakers have several choices when it comes to rail disputes, from not acting at all to requiring binding arbitration.
Several lawmakers said they were reluctant to impose a settlement. "I do not favor direct imposition," said House Speaker Thomas S. Foley, but he noted that "a rail strike that took any period of time to resolve would create devastating consequences."
Representative Dennis E. Eckart of Ohio, a senior Democrat on the committee, warned industry officials at the subcommittee's hearing Wednesday that "efforts to slam dunk or force feed" the Presidential board's recommendations "down anyone's throat ain't going nowhere."
Union leaders told the panel earlier today that they would go along with the limited negotiating period, but officials representing freight carriers said they would have preferred that Congress force the unions to accept the recommendations of the Presidential board.
 
Railroads Back First Board
 Michael H. Walsh, chairman of Union Pacific Railroad Company, urged the subcommittee to go along with the Presidential board's recommendations. "Should you, the Congress, attempt to augment or alter the report?" he asked. "My answer is no. The board's recommendations represent a balance, a compromise between the claims of the parties."
But Fred Hardin, president of the United Transportation Union, which represents about 100,000 train crew members, complained to the panel that the Presidential board's report had sought too many concessions from workers.
"We'll make agreements," Mr. Hardin said, "but we don't want Congress to cram it down our throats just because a few railroad presidents want to make some more money."
Mr. Swift said it was not fair to call his committee's agreement a forced settlement. "I would not call it binding arbitration," he said. "What I'm saying is at some point it's got to end. And Congress is not going to set up a merry-go-round where it comes back here again."
Officials involved in the negotiations said agreement on the legislation was delayed for several hours because of a dispute over who would appoint the three members of the new mediation board. The negotiators finally agreed that one member would be drawn from the Presidential emergency board and the other two would be appointed by Mr. Bush from a list supplied by the National Mediation Board.
 
Some Pessimism
 There was not widespread optimism that the new cooling-off period would ultimately solve the dispute. Mr. Hardin, for one, said he feared that once the cooling-off period ended, "we would just be faced with the same crisis."
Despite the history of Congressional involvement in railroad strikes, several members said Wednesday that they felt uncomfortable with that role. At the hearing, they repeatedly asked Joshua Javits, chairman of the National Mediation Board, for advice on how to handle the strike.
Representative Don Ritter of Pennsylvania, who is the ranking Republican on the transportation subcommittee, told Mr. Javits: "Most of us members of Congress feel somwhat uncomfortable in a position of settling a labor- management dispute via legislation. The National Mediation Board wasn't successful in mediating the dispute -- now we have a strike on our hands."
But Mr. Javits replied that it was not his place to advise the lawmakers, saying it would lead to accusations that he was "gratuitously taking sides, which would undermine my position as a mediator."
Union leaders were angry that the Government appeared unwilling to let the strike run a week or so, a period that they hoped would force more concessions on wages and working conditions than the railroads have been willing to grant over the three years since the negotiations began.
Before Congress's action, Tom DuBose, assistant president of the United Transportation Union, one of those involved in the strike, said: "We don't want Congress to intervene in collective bargaining. That's not their role. We think we can best settle our own problems."
He said fears of a devastating effect on the economy were exaggerated.
Many businesses, including utilities that burn coal to produce electricity, builders that use train-carried lumber and newspapers that rely on trains to bring in their newsprint, had stockpiled as much as a month's worth of supplies.
But other businesses, notably the automobile industry, did not.
Coal represents 38 percent of all rail freight tonnage, and a strike of even a few days could have forced layoffs of possibly thousands of miners. Many coal companies have such large stockpiles at the mine sites that they have no more room to store it above ground, industry officials said.
General Motors, a heavy user of railshipped parts and materials, said its plants kept operating Wednesday. "But we do estimate that 75 percent to 80 percent of our production will be affected within the next 24 hours," which could bring widespread layoffs, said Carol Longridge, a spokeswoman.
 
Few Commuters Affected
 Far fewer people who commute to work on trains were affected than expected in the hours before the strike. The hardest hit were 22,000 who commute between the Silicon Valley and San Francisco. CalTrain, a state-run train service between San Jose and San Francisco, was shut down by Southern Pacific Transportation Company, which owns the CalTrain tracks, shortly after 5 A.M., even though the CalTrain workers' unions had agreed not to extend their strike from freight lines to commuter service.
But tonight, CalTrain and Southern Pacific were trying to devise a plan to restore most commuter service by this morning.
Chicago commuters were expected to be severely affected, but the city's Union Station was awash with trench coats and brief cases Wednesday morning as passengers rode the trains and arrived downtown as usual.
Late Tuesday afternoon, Cook County Circuit Court Judge Sophia Hall issued a temporary restraining order, requiring the Chicago & North Western Transportation Company to keep open its three commuter lines for 10 days. Management of six other lines have voluntarily continued service.
 
Amtrak Continues to Run
 In addition to its Boston-to-Washington corridor, Amtrak was able to continue service along the second biggest corridor, from Los Angeles to San Diego, and along the third busiest, from Albany to New York, with the consent of the freight lines that own the tracks on those routes.
Unions representing 235,000 workers went out on strike against the 10 biggest freight companies and against 88 of the 500 other smaller lines. Three unions have settled the negotiations begun three years ago, when the last contract ended and wages were frozen at levels where they remain today. Their wages, averaging around $36,000 a year, nevertheless put them close to the top of the nation's blue-collar work force.
Eight or nine unions went out on strike, depending on how they are counted. Clerks who belong to the Transportation Communications Workers union, along with two other unions, reached tentative agreements with the railroads. But the carmen in the T.C.U. did not.
 
The Issues
 One issue involves the number of people a railroad needs to run a train -- the unions say four or five in the cases of some trains, and management says just two. Another involves how far a worker must travel to be credited for having worked a full day. Currently the distance is 108 miles, although over an eight-hour period, trains often travel twice that distance. The unions want to reduce the distance to the traditional level of 100 miles; management wants about twice the distance.
With the failure of collective bargaining and Federal mediation, President Bush intervened in the negotiations last May in appointing a Presidential Emergency Board to propose compromises. The board completed its report in January.
The railroads considered most of the recommendations acceptable, but the unions did not. The unions were required to spend 30 days cooling off, but with the war over Kuwait under way in February, they stretched it to 90 days, which ended at midnight Tuesday.

Chart: "The Rail Dispute: A Primer"
 The nation's freight railroads and unions that represent most of their workers are at loggerheads over two issues, wages and work rules, and close to agreement on one, health benefits.
 
UNIONS' POSITION
 
Wages:
Demand annual wage increase of 5 percent until 1995 and retroactive to 1988, when wages were frozen and the current negotiations began. Also want cost of living increases.
 
Work rules:
A worker is currently paid for a full day's work after traveling 108 miles; unions want to return to the traditional 100-mile day. Also seek to maintain current staffing levels aboard frieght trains at four or five, contending that they are necessary for safe operation.
 
Health Benefits:
 Have agreed to use health maintenance organizations and to have workers pay 15 percent of health care costs. Minor differences remain over increases in deductibles.

RAILROADS' POSTION
 
Wages:
 Claim insufficient funds to keep improving their equipment. Want to maintain the freeze until 1995, when the next talks would begin.
 
Work Rules:
 Seek more than double the 108 miles, since today's faster trains can cover the distance in a couple of hours. Also want to reduce the numbers of workers in many cases to two, maintaining that modern trains do not need large crews.
 Alternatively, management proposes retaining current staffing levels but reducing wages enough so that the wages of the workers aboard a train would not exceed the total earned by two workers.
 
Health Benefits:
Now pay health care costs except for a $100 deductible. With health care costs growing 10 percent to 20 percent a year, want workers to use H.M.O.'s where they are available and, where not, to pay 20 percent of the cost.

HEADLINE: Head of Ex-Im Bank Denies White House Pushed on Iraq

BYLINE: By MARTIN TOLCHIN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 17

 BODY:
John D. Macomber, the president and chairman of the Export-Import Bank, told skeptical members of Congress today that the Reagan and Bush Administrations had exerted "absolutely no pressure" on the agency's decision to guarantee $267 million in American exports to Iraq between 1987 and 1990.
Mr. Macomber acknowledged, in an interview after the session, that officials of the Departments of State and Commerce had sought to persuade his agency to lift the ban on such aid. But he said their communications were in the form of suggestions, not commands. 
 "We hear from other agencies," Mr. Macomber said. "Everybody makes his case. But there was absolutely no pressure."
In 1987, the agency reversed its ban on such guarantees solely because Iraq had repaid its debts, Mr. Macomber told the House Committee on Banking, Finance and Urban Affairs.
"The test is creditworthiness," Mr. Macomber told the committee. "As far as we were concerned, they had brought themselves up to date."
Mr. Macomber said the bank provided only short-term guarantees of up to one year and set a limit of $200 million. "We limited ourselves to short-term credit which, in the world of international banking, does not amount to very much." A total of $267 million was guaranteed, in 182 different transactions.
Representative Henry B. Gonzalez, the Texas Democrat who is chairman of the banking committee, told the hearing that his staff's interviews with State and Commerce Department officials had disclosed communications with Export-Import Bank officials that he said had been intended to persuade the agency to reverse its policy against guarantees to Iraq.
April Glaspie, who was Ambassador to Iraq at the time, was among those who lobbied the export agency on behalf of American businesses and Iraq, Mr. Gonzalez said. The General Motors Corporation and the Bechtel Group Inc. were among the American corporations that sought long-term guarantees for Iraq, he said.
"Because of its tough stance against loaning billions to Iraq, the Export-Import Bank was repeatedly chastised by the staff of the State and Commerce Departments." Mr. Gonzalez said. "During 1989, criticism from State and Commerce Department staff was severe enough to cause the Export-Import Bank board of directors to reconsider its negative conclusion regarding Iraq's creditworthiness."
Asked after the hearing if these charges were true, Mr. Macomber said, "Absolutely not." The bank was not chastised, he said, nor did the criticism cause the bank to reconsider its ban on long-term guarantees to Iraq.
 
Iraq Still Owes $50.8 Million
 Representative Bruce F. Vento, Democrat of Minnesota, said after the hearing: "It seems to me that here's a case where creditworthiness went out the window, and the Administration's public policy prevailed. On the face of it, this is not what the Export-Import Bank should have been doing."
Mr. Macomber acknowledged in his tesitmony that Iraq still owed the bank $50.8 million.
The banking committee made public a report to the export agency, written in July 1988 by Thomas A. Forbord, vice president for country risk analysis, which Mr. Gonzalez said raised questions about Iraq's creditworthiness. The report concluded: "With oil revenues unpredictable and insufficient to cover Iraq's financing needs, Baghdad wants to secure strategic financiall partners who place their military, political and economic interests in Iraq above their requirements for repayment. Within this context, Iraq repays in full only those who provide credits in excess of payments falling due."
The Export-Import Bank was founded 56 years ago to stimulate trade by providing financing to overseas buyers of American goods at below-market rates. Since 1974, the agency has had a policy of financing only nonmilitary exports, which the Bush Administration is now seeking to revise.

HEADLINE: A Budget Worth Noticing, Barely

 BODY:
The House approved a budget resolution yesterday that sets better domestic spending priorities than those proposed in the President's budget. But both budgets barely nibble at the edges of the huge Federal spending programs.
That's because the budget law passed last fall guts Congress's right to make important decisions for the next two years. The total that can be spent on domestic discretionary programs is capped; the amounts raised by taxes and spent on the Pentagon and entitlements are virtually locked in place. That leaves Congress and the White House room only to play at the margins. 
 The House budget, compared with President Bush's, would pour an extra $13 billion into programs -- education, nutrition and medical -- targeted on low-income families. Much of the money would come from a $1 billion cut in the space program proposed by the President, and a 1 percent across-the-board cut in administrative and other non-priority expenses. A similar bill is working its way through the Senate.
These are the right priorities: a program to build a gargantuan space station can be slowed, a program to feed hungry children cannot. Yet even within the new budget law, the House could have done more. It could have removed the crippling, and unconscionable, welfare load from beleaguered cities by raising the Federal share of expenditures, along with new taxes to pay for it.
At the very least, the House could have backed the bold White House plan to strip some Medicare and agriculture entitlements from the very rich. Over time, targeting entitlements would free up billions for education, training and infrastructure -- the foundations of a healthy economy.
Yes, the House budget is better than the President's. But shuffling $13 billion in a trillion-dollar budget isn't much of a change. So yesterday's vote won't stir passions, and small wonder.

HEADLINE: EDITORIAL NOTEBOOK;
High Noon on High Street

BYLINE: By ROBERT B. SEMPLE JR.

 BODY:
The fierce battle between students and alumni over the admission of women to Yale's most secretive and ritualistic senior society, Skull and Bones, ranks right up there -- or down there -- with the other stories that have diverted readers from the aftermath of the Persian Gulf war, including the latest Kennedy family imbroglio in Palm Beach and Kitty Kelley's book about Nancy Reagan.
Still, to someone who attended Yale in the 50's and whose wife says he was an "Old Blue" before he left New Haven, the story has resonance. It offers useful commentary on generational change, on present student priorities and on a durable truth about universities: Both students and alumni think they run them. 
 The battle is simply described. The current delegation of 15 Bonesmen broke radically with 159 years of tradition by "tapping," or choosing, seven women for next year's delegation. A stunned alumni board of directors responded by locking the ancient tomb on High Street, and declaring the election null and void.
Some compromise may be in the cards, but so far the air is heavy with insult. The students are threatening a lawsuit. The graduates have countered with an atavistic "separate but equal" plan under which males and females would eat together but then break up into separate groups for the sharing of "emotional and life histories" -- the intense autobiographical sessions practiced by nearly all of Yale's seven secret societies.
The alumni are fighting a losing battle. Women have been attending Yale for more than 20 years, and the existence of an all-male institution in this determinedly coeducational society is plainly an uncomfortable anachronism, if not an affront. That's precisely what a former Yale president, A. Bartlett Giamatti, told the alumni of his own society, Scroll and Key, which he loved but which he vowed never to visit again unless women were admitted. They finally were, in 1989.
Furthermore, despite the alumni's strong convictions and economic clout, the societies exist mainly to serve the undergraduates. The students run them and perpetuate them, and if the present Bones group chooses not to elect a delegation other than the one it has already picked, then Bones could be out of business: a pyrrhic victory, to say the least, for the old guard.
The attendant publicity may have strengthened the notion that these clandestine institutions are hugely important. They can in fact be wonderful places. Most members enjoy them; durable and comforting friendships are formed.
Acceptance was also once thought to be a referendum on one's undergraduate career, an idea reinforced by a brutal description of Tap Day in the novel "Stover at Yale," where senior members raced into the courtyard and "tapped" their lucky successors, leaving 900 other juniors standing around feeling like failures.
But admission nowadays is neither a certification of undergraduate triumph nor, as was once supposed, a guarantee of future success -- Bonesmen George Herbert Walker Bush and William F. Buckley to the contrary. The Bones stockbroker who (perhaps apocryphally) left his club pin on the window ledge just before he jumped after the crash of 1929 may have cherished Bones, but he did not die a happy or wealthy man.
This is the final decade of the 20th century. Seize it, ye men of Bones.

HEADLINE: ESSAY;
Tall In the Straddle

BYLINE: By WILLIAM SAFIRE

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
When the President's press secretary opined that his boss did not have to have an arms treaty all set to sign in order to meet at the summit with Mr. Gorbachev, two groups were horrified:
The sniveling, save-Gorby-from-the-baddies arms-control establishment (you know who you are) want a summit linked to a Start treaty because that will pressure the White House to accede to Soviet demands. 
 The ultra-suspicious, press-'em- till-they-cave, unreconstructed cold warriors (we know who we are) want to dangle the prospect of a summit, which Mr. Gorbachev needs, to induce him to keep treaty promises made in days of wine and glasnost.
This crossfire caused Marlin Fitzwater, behind the curve on this arcane negotiating stuff, to flip-flop the same day, calling for a summit conditioned on a treaty. Asked about the disarray, President Bush said, "I'm backing both of Marlin's positions."
Let's hope this confuses the Soviets. The bushed Bushies are finding it hard to walk a straight line on Kurdish relief and chew disarmament gum at the same time.
Here's what the President should do on troop withdrawals and arms reductions:
1. Stick to your guns on putting the withdrawal of conventional forces from Europe (C.F.E., which we want most) ahead of a treaty on strategic missiles (Start, which Gorby needs to lock in his nuclear advantage).
Moscow has pulled a fast one on us by breaking its word on troop withdrawals. After the deal was struck, the Soviets renamed three divisions of army troops "naval adjuncts" -- pure bad-faith dealing. Mr. Gorbachev now grandly offers to settle for half his subterfuge; if Mr. Bush buys that, he sets himself up as a patsy right down the line.
We should insist on an end to "data denial" -- the Soviets' pretense that they have in place only half the tanks and artillery we can count. When we gave them the list of their own forces to be reduced, the Soviet negotiators froze.
2. After credibility is re-established on previously agreed troop pullbacks and tank destruction, remove the non-starters stopping Start.
This means dismissing "down-loading," the unverifiable Soviet promise to load only two warheads on submarine ballistic missiles already proven capable of holding seven.
Do not let them sell new wine in old bottles. Ronald Reagan won a real reduction by half the huge SS-18's targeted on the U.S. But the Soviets tricked us by vastly improving the accuracy of the remaining half: pre-agreement, two Soviet warheads were needed to take out one of our hard targets, but now it's down to one.
Thus, the "reduction" in missile numbers does not reduce their threat to destroy our ability to retaliate. (Go explain that to Marlin.)
3. Stop treating those substantial disagreements caused by the Soviets' duplicity, as well as their resistance to on-site inspection of mobile missiles, as mere "technical differences."
The more Mr. Bush minimizes the made-in-Moscow difficulties, the more Mr. Gorbachev will say "then let's split the difference." (The moment James Baker hears the word "split" he says, "Where do I sign?") It's no negotiating victory to come out half-tricked; let's not permit the Soviets to disavow hard-won agreements.
Now to the original question: Should a summit be linked to a treaty-signing?
Yes, we should let Mr. Gorbachev strut the summit stage if he delivers on his agreement to reduce conventional forces in Europe without renaming the Red Army the Coast Guard.
No, we should not tie the summit to a Start treaty because that would help him pressure us. If he wants to sell a lowball warhead count on his subs and modernize his SS-18's, we can apply intolerable economic pressure to stop such trickery by speeding the development of our nuclear shield.
The hard-line plan: First get a C.F.E. treaty. Then agree to hold a summit for its signing. There, while boosting each other's ratings, squeeze him on Baltic independence. Regale his Gromov-Pugo handlers with what Tibet's courageous Dalai Lama says about human rights, and on Kurdistan, hold an enclave conclave. Assure Gorby of trade only after a command economy stops bankrupting his confederation.
Then, in that wide-ranging context, reassert the need for a verifiable, Senate-confirmable deal to really reduce his strategic missile threat.

HEADLINE: Looking Again at Iraq Without War Hysteria

 BODY:
To the Editor:
A comment on John Chancellor's excellent and timely "War Stories," (Op-Ed, April 1), reminding us that truth is a casualty of war and cautioning against uncritical acceptance of accounts of Iraqi atrocities:
His reference to the "psychology of the war" merits emphasis. Our claim to humanity, in the face of estimates of 100,000 to 200,000 Iraqi deaths, probably the highest rate of killing in the history of organized warfare, is linked to the belief that Saddam Hussein is evil incarnate. 
 There is a further danger from simple juxtapositions of evil and virtue. President Bush cannot exonerate himself from the responsibility to examine if all the carnage was necessary. Blaming the Iraqi Government in the bunker bombing, for instance, seems uncomfortably close to the Irish Republican Army's blaming the British Government for the railway station it targeted recently.
President Bush has decided that he cannot be a party to the breakup of the Iraqi state or engineer the overthrow of Saddam Hussein. This is a more prudent course of action than one that would result from the assumption that Saddam Hussein is unallayed evil and that there are no rivals to his record of human rights violations, including our own allies.
Finally, the typical third-world state, whatever its antiquity as a civilization, is a recent and tenuous political entity, housing ancient divisions and identities. Few countries, whether autocratic or democratic, would survive unscathed the onslaught and breakup of order Iraq has experienced.

HEADLINE: Higher New Jersey Auto Registration Offsets Insurance Cuts

 BODY:
To the Editor:
In your April 1 report on cuts in New Jersey auto insurance, you fail to observe that the administration of Gov. Jim Florio is playing the old shell game with the state's drivers -- giving with one hand while taking back with the other. Some of us are getting taken more than others.
My wife and I both work, and each of us requires an automobile to get to our places of employment. My wife drives a 1986 Mazda; I drive a 1986 General Motors small pickup truck. 
 I recently received my registration renewal form for the pickup. The fee last year was $56. This year it is $106.40. A notice with the renewal form points out that 40 cents of this increase, which will be in effect for the next six years, will be used for development (not manufacture?) of reflectorized license plates, an outstanding example of setting priorities in tight economic times.
The balance of the increase, or $50, is to "help fund the New Jersey insurance reform program," according to a message sent with the renewal. The increase raises my cost of registration for the pickup almost 89 percent But wait. The increase for my wife's car, the same age as mine, is only $15. There is no explanation why a standard half-ton pickup, essentially the same size, weight and dimensions as many sedans on the road, is surcharged $35 more a year than those sedans. Even a new car is only charged $40 more a year for the first two years, but vans and trucks, no matter their age, pay $50 a year.
The so-called reduction that the state has promised in insurance premiums is offset by higher registration fees for the next six years. The state is pocketing money what previously went to the insurance companies, which have expressed their intention to file for rate increases.
I wonder when we'll see those reflectorized plates?

HEADLINE: Price Fixing Always Victimizes the Consumer

 BODY:
To the Editor:
In the course of "Price Fixing Isn't Always Gouging" (editorial, April 1), your apologia for vertical price fixing, you assert that illegal conspiracies to boost the retail price of a product between manufacturers and their retailers "aren't common." This is particularly ill timed.
Just a week earlier, all 50 state attorneys general ended one of the largest vertical price-fixing cases in the history of antitrust enforcement with an $8 million settlement against the Japanese electronics giant Mitsubishi for an illegal scheme that cheated more than 260,000 United States purchasers of televisions. 
 A week after your editorial, 40 states, led by New York, joined the Federal Trade Commission in a case in which Nintendo, a company with $4 billion in United States sales last year, illegally conspired to boost the price of its video game consoles to nine million consumers.
These cases are but the latest in a line that includes a 49-state settlement with Panasonic in 1989 and a 37-state settlement with Minolta in 1986. These cases involved millions of dollars in overcharging by vertical conspiracies. Of local interest to New Yorkers were cases we brought in 1981 in which 47 milk distributors pleaded guilty to criminal charges in a vertical price fixing scheme that inflated consumer prices.
The real issue is not whether or not illegal vertical price fixing exists: it's endemic. The real issue is whether or not antitrust enforcers have the tools to find and prosecute these conspiracies. The two recent Supreme Court decisions you praise put extraordinary roadblocks in our way. These decisions did not, as you state, redefine if or when vertical price fixing is illegal. Rather, the Court adopted absurdly restrictive burden of proof requirements that make it easy for companies to disguise their behavior so that illegal conspiracies cannot be brought to court, by government enforcers or by the discount stores that are victimized by these practices.
Indeed, Terry Calvani, former Federal Trade Commissioner, said the Supreme Court's rulings left such big loopholes that a corporate officer would have to have "an I.Q. two points lower than a carrot" to get caught. Antitrust enforcers can recount scores of tales of retailers calling our offices too scared to give their names, telling of coercion and intimidation by manufacturers' representatives and rival dealers because their prices were too low. Under the Supreme Court's rules we would have little chance of making a case.
The effect of the bill sponsored by Senator Howard Metzenbaum, which you now oppose after years of consistent support for tough antitrust enforcement, would simply be to overturn these burden of proof requirements, so that vertical price fixing cases could go before juries. It would put teeth back into a statute that has been rendered virtually unenforceable, and 45 state attorneys general support it for that reason.
As to the economic effect of vertical price fixing, you pass it off as a generally benign process designed to "encourage better service to consumers." The reality is quite different. If manufacturers want better service, there are dozens of legal ways to require it directly, short of fixing and raising retail prices. The true effect of vertical price fixing is exactly what one would expect: if you increase prices to consumers, you increase profits for the retailers and for the manufacturers.
The Federal Trade Commission found vertical price fixing inflates prices to consumers 10 percent to 23 percent.

HEADLINE: Retirement Plan For Teachers

 BODY:
The New York City Board of Education approved yesterday a plan to encourage older teachers to retire this year, thereby helping thousands of younger teachers to keep their jobs in the face of the city's fiscal troubles.
James S. Vlasto, a spokesman for Schools Chancellor Joseph A. Fernandez, said he expected the plan to bring retirements this June to 2,500 -- 1,500 more than usual. That would reduce the number of teachers threatened with layoffs by a far higher figure since senior teachers earn twice as much as novices. It would also allow the system to retain more of its black and Hispanic teachers, with many of them hired in recent years.
The plan requires approval by the Legislature. It would give teachers retiring before July 1 credit for three extra years of service in calculating pensions. Retiring teachers generally receive 40 to 60 percent of their final year's salary, depending on how many years they have worked. Only employees 55 or older with at least 30 years of service are eligible to retire.

CORRECTION-DATE: April 19, 1991, Friday

 CORRECTION:
A brief article yesterday about the New York City Board of Education's plan to encourage early retirement of teachers misstated the eligibility requirements. Teachers may retire early if they are 55 or older, or if they have at least 30 years' service; they need not meet both conditions.

HEADLINE: AFTER THE WAR;
Schwarzkopf Plans Return To U.S. and Fall Retirement

BYLINE: By MICHAEL R. GORDON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HAFR AL BATEN, Saudi Arabia, April 17

 BODY:
Gen. H. Norman Schwarzkopf, the commander of American forces in the Persian Gulf, plans to return to the United States on Saturday, the American military authorities said today.
General Schwarzkopf, 56 years old, plans to retire from the Army by the fall, and there have been reports that he has received a number of lucrative offers for his memoirs and has been approached to take high-ranking civilian posts. 
 Lieut. Gen. William Pagonis, the top military official in charge of logistics, will oversee the withdrawal of American troops in the Persian Gulf once General Schwarzkopf departs.
General Schwarzkopf's departure will cap an extraordinary eight-month tour in Saudi Arabia, in which the commander marshaled a force of more than 540,000 troops to decisively defeat the Iraqi military.
 
To Return to Tampa, Fla.
 Before Iraqi forces invaded Kuwait, General Schwarzkopf and his command were little known to the American public. The focus was on NATO and the political changes sweeping eastern Europe.
But since the gulf crisis, the burly four-star general has become a folk hero to much of the public, even as debate continues over the Bush Administration's refusal to aid Iraqi insurgents seeking to topple President Saddam Hussein.
Capt. Ronald E. Wildermuth, the general's chief spokesman, said that the commander decided to return to his command headquarters in Tampa, Fla., because American forces were well on their way to leaving southern Iraq, except for a buffer zone along the Iraq-Kuwait border which American troops will occupy until United Nations observers take their place. More than 50 percent of the American forces deployed in the Persian Gulf have left, Captain Wildermuth noted.
 
Speculation on Position
 In addition, Captain Wildermuth said that the General believed that Iraqi refugees "are in good hands," since United Nations observers will be taking up positions in the buffer area, which is to be demilitarized. Many refugees and some American soldiers, however, are fearful that the United Nations observers will not be able to adequately protect the refugees against retaliation by agents of the Hussein Government.
There was some speculation in past months that General Schwarzkopf might succeed Gen. Carl E. Vuono as Chief of Staff of the Army. But General Schwarzkopf appeared to have had little interest in that position, whose principal focus is now to be the unglamorous task of overseeing the shrinkage of the Army from 18 active divisions to 12 active divisions.
Lieut. Gen. Gordon Sullivan, who currently serves as the Army's Vice Chief of Staff, will be General Vuono's successor, the Army announced today.
General Sullivan has risen quickly in the Army's high command. In 1988 he took command of the First Infantry Division at Fort Riley, Kan. Before serving as Vice Chief of the Army he was a deputy chief of staff in charge of planning and operations.
 
Counseled Patience
 As commander of American forces in the Persian Gulf, General Schwarzkopf counseled patience at first, rejecting early calls to take military action instead of waiting to see if economic sanctions would work. But at the same time, General Schwarzkopf oversaw plans to envelop and crush Iraq's Republican Guard.
Though General Schwarzkopf presided over one of the most one-sided victories in modern warfare, the United States' handling of the gulf war has been challenged in recent weeks.
President Bush's decision to end the ground war at 100 hours allowed more Iraqi tanks and armored personnel carriers to escape than the American military authorities in Saudi Arabia believed at first, according to American intelligence estimates.
General Schwarzkopf irked the White House and the Pentagon when he said in a television interview that he had recommended that the United States continue the attack to complete the destruction of Iraq's Republican Guard forces, which were later used to put down rebellions in Iraq.
 
A Forward Headquarters
 The White House and Defense Secretary Dick Cheney said that General Schwarzkopf had not made such recommendations before President Bush ordered the suspension of military action. Since the controversy, the General and the White House have sought to downplay the dispute and project an image of unity.
United States Central Command, which is led by General Schwarzkopf, is headquartered in Tampa, Fla. It is responsible for American military operations in the Persian Gulf. The United States established a temporary forward headquarters in Riyadh and is discussing the establishment of a forward headquarters in Bahrain. If a forward headquarters is established in Bahrain the main headquarters will continue to be in Florida.
Plans have also been made by the American military to stockpile armored equipment in Saudi Arabia.

HEADLINE: NFL DRAFT;
Tagliabue Looks at Dollars, Deals and N.F.L. Draft

BYLINE: By THOMAS GEORGE

 BODY:
With the National Football League draft opening on Sunday, Commissioner Paul Tagliabue said yesterday that he was not concerned that the draft's top prize -- Raghib Ismail of Notre Dame -- might shun the league and play in Canada instead. But he said he was concerned about the draft's future as it pertains to the league's economics, suggesting that a salary cap and a rookie wage scale may be unavoidable.
Tagliabue made his comments in a meeting yesterday with the football writers and editors of The New York Times. In addition to the draft, Tagliabue discussed a wide range of issues, including pay-per-view television, maintaining solvent franchises and league expansion and realignment. For every issue, Tagliabue has a position. Whether he can continue to gain three-quarters support from his head-strong group of 28 owners will decide how successfully he meets the challenges. 
 On the possibility that Ismail, the draft's favored No. 1 pick, might sign with the Canadian Football League, Tagliabue said: "Frankly, I haven't thought about it. He may be unique, but there haven't been too many people that size who have been an impact player."
How about the Jets and the Giants battling in the same division in a natural homegrown rivalry? Tampa Bay and Miami? Dallas and Houston? Chicago and Indianapolis? Tagliabue said his realignment and expansion committees are seriously exploring these and other options.
Economically, to help insure the N.F.L.'s continued health and growth, the commissioner said a rookie wage scale, a salary cap for each team and more creative ways of revenue sharing among the teams make sense to him. Implementing these ideas, he said, are among the most complicated issues he faces.
In short, in everything Tagliabue tackles as commissioner, he appears to stay true to the legacy that George Halas and Rozelle and others formed decades ago: that no matter how bad your club is, there is always hope, because the N.F.L. seeks to excel with many being equal.
"The N.B.A. survived for several years with only seven strong teams, but we can't," Tagliabue said. "We'll always try to have a league competitive across the board. A league of 28 teams and no weak sisters."
Following are the highlights of Tagliabue's comments on the issues facing the league.
 
The Draft
 Q. Would losing Rocket Ismail to the Canadian Football League concern you?
A. Well, I think he's a great player obviously, an exciting player. But, frankly, I haven't spent a lot of time thinking about the consequences of the Rocket going to the Canadian Football League. We would like to have him, but if they have a package they can offer him, we obviously don't have a choice. Part of the question is a larger question the club people have raised: Is he really indeed the type of impact player who over the course of the season is going to affect any particular team in the league? There are different points of view on that. Everyone thinks he's a great athlete. The question is, is he in the game for 5 plays or 15 plays? In the Canadian League I think he'd be a great player for 25 or 30 plays. This is one of the points they have been trying to sell him.

 Q. What about the contract for the draft, which expires after 1992. What do you do then?

 A. We're not wedded to this particular form of the draft and we can work out something as good or better in terms of avoiding holdouts, which I think a lot of people realize are a problem. We can certainly look at that. As you know, if we can get a collective bargaining agreement I'd be as happy as anybody. We'll be working on that between now and next year, and hopefully we will get that and it will include some kind of a new draft. The draft has changed a lot. Since 1977, we've expanded with underclassmen and in 1987 the rounds were cut from 18 to 12. It's clearly changed more in the last 15 years than the last 40 years. I suspect it will change some more.

 Q. The N.C.A.A., particularly its director, Dick Schultz, wants players to be able to enter the draft, find out their market value, and then be able to return to school. If the N.C.A.A. allows this, what will you do?

 A. I've already told them what our reaction is and I think a lot of their coaches have told them what their reaction is, that this would be counterproductive from their standpoint. They are increasingly concerned about the college football player or the college basketball player dropping his studies and dropping out of school. I think this type of system would tremendously intensify the pressures for athletes to drop out.

 Q. Couldn't that eventually become your problem from a public relations standpoint?

 A. I think it could be. We would probably have to create developmental squads or feeder leagues or something to continue to work with the players to develop their skills and also continue to do what we're doing more intensively now, work with them to get their degrees.
 
League Economics

 Q: What are some of your concerns with regard to the economic health of the N.F.L. in the face of the escalating salaries in major league baseball?

 A: I think baseball has some serious problems. Fay Vincent said the Red Sox payroll would exceed the revenue of the Mariners. I don't think you can run a healthy league very long if you have that type of disparity.

 Q: How do you propose solving the problem for the N.F.L.?

 A: Some system that would guarantee the players a percentage of the revenue, whatever the revenue is, with a built-in cap so that your salaries and player cost would stay in some rough relationship to your revenue. I think that would be healthier for everybody.
We had looked at some numbers last year before the most recent escalation of baseball salaries and we were paying about 58 to 59 percent of our revenue to players. The N.B.A. was paying about 48 percent and baseball was paying somewhere around 40 percent, excluding the 10 percent for the support of the minor leagues. We're playing 60 players per team and the N.B.A. is only playing 12 or 13, so their salaries are going to escalate. The average salary per club for the N.B.A. this year is $12 million. Ours is about double that to about $24 million per club.

 Q: What are the other problems?

 A: One of them is the relationship of the big-market teams to the small- market teams. We have a problem, even though we share all our TV revenue equally. We still have some fairly unhealthy differences between our high-revenue teams and low-revenue teams. This year every team will be getting $28 million from the network telelvision contract. We have some teams that will be getting another $25 to $28 million on top of that. Those are the high-revenue teams. We have another group of teams that will have $13 to $15 million. Those are the low-revenue teams. We have a group of teams that have what I call supplemental income. That's a big problem, if you're trying design a system which guarantees players a percentage of revenue at a certain level.

 Q: How do you propose remedying that?

 A: There's going to have to be more cost sharing or more revenue sharing. The N.B.A. is doing it. They have a subsidy assistance program where the low-revenue teams can get a subsidy for some of those reasons.

 Q: Are N.F.L. teams going to go for this?

 A: If you have a cap I don't see it as a real concern. I think some people tend to think of our future system in terms of the current system. The one thing we've found in the last year is that these issues are extremely complicated because of the different revenues of the teams. Some clubs have been spending 70 percent of their revenue on players over the last decades. Other clubs have spent 35 to 40 percent. To take that range and force it to the midpoint is what a guaranteed cap system does.

 Q: If you were to put that before the owners tomorrow would it pass?

 A: I think it would be very close to a three-quarters vote in favor of the concept, but a lot of real and taxing questions on how do we get there and how do we make the transition. The details are critical.

 
 
Labor

 Q: Where does the N.F.L. stand at this point with regard to negotiating a collective bargaining agreement with the players?

 A: We've been able to keep open the lines of communication with the players and their representatives. It began as soon as I was elected. We had some conversations with Gene Upshaw back in November and those lines of communication continue to be open with our new labor relations representative, Harold Henderson. We are finally putting in place all the pieces that I think are needed to make some progress in that area.

 Q: What are the primary issues?

 A: The issues cover the whole gamut of what has to be put in place. What kind of salary system we have for entering players? What kind of salary system we have for the veteran players? And what type of a benefits package do you have? That whole question of how much money is negotiated individually by the players and how much is guaranteed as a collective benefits package is a major issue that has yet to be seriously discussed. We're spending more money than any sport on players as a percentage of our revenue. No one has sat down to conceptualize what's the most ideal way to spend it from the teams' standpoint and the players' standpoint.

 
 
The 1991 Season

 
Q. Will there be any changes in the media-access policy to avoid the Patriots and Bengals incidents of last year?

 A. The basic policy will be the same. Equal access to all accredited media will be guaranteed. We're working on some improvements to implement the policy. I think we'll eliminate some of the problems. We're talking about, while keeping the locker room open, we'll require the clubs to have better interview rooms. We're also focusing on just the physical environment of the locker room. The Saints have put in individualized curtains so that they'll have cubicles. It cost about $5,000. There are a number of things the clubs can do on their own.

Q. Did you get much public response?

 A. I don't know. I don't pay particular attention to what people think on the "Donahue" show.

Q. How are you considering improving the schedule?

 A. We've done some things for the first time I think will help. We're working with a computer consultant, and it has enabled us to deal with some of the problems we had last year: on spacing of games, and better spread of the games within divisions. Last year we had the Giants and Redskins play twice within a couple of weeks. We've been able to come up with a spread in the schedule that's better. There are literally tens of thousands of permutations it can make in a matter of seconds. It doesn't make the schedule, but it helps us. I've seen this year's computer printout, and there isn't one home-and-home series that's over within less than half a season. We had a lot of those last year. This year, every home-and-home series in every division is spread between the first half and second half. The closest anyone comes is the second week and the ninth week.

 
 
The 1990's

 
 Q. Is the league still considering experimenting with pay-per-view on a limited basis in 1992?

 A. At this point I'd have to say it's unlikely. Our major emphasis will be in making our current television contracts work. Our focus will be on improving scheduling and attracting advertisers.

 Q. Has the threat of Congressional investigation into your starting pay-per-view played a role in the decision to delay it?

 A. I don't think so. Once we explained to them that we were still going to have regular free television, and this would be in selected markets, they understood it.

 Q. What about pay-per-view in 1993?

 A. If we can do it without upsetting CBS and NBC.

 Q. Will the Super Bowl be on pay TV?

 A. As I said to Congress, not in this decade.

 Q. What are the possibilities of realignment among the present teams?

 A. I think there are three examples that come up. One is Tampa Bay-Miami. Another is Houston-Dallas. Another is Chicago-Indianapolis. You have tremendous geographical rivalries in college such as Michigan-Michigan State, and Florida-Florida State. If you start with that concept, a Tampa Bay-Miami rivalry would be a very attractive rivalry. Or a Colts-Bears rivalry. You could switch two teams. Take Tampa Bay out of the N.F.C. Central and put it in the A.F.C. East and move the Colts to the N.F.C. Central, and you've solved those two rivalries in a very simple way.

Lawsuit Gain Aids Manville

 BODY:
The Manville Corporation reported yesterday that it netted $35 million, or 26 cents a share, in the first quarter, up 41 percent from $24.9 million, or 18 cents a share, a year ago. But a one-time, $40 million gain from settlement of a patent infringement lawsuit accounted for all of its profits.
Operating income fell nearly 37 percent, to $41.6 million from $65.5 million a year ago. Revenues fell 4.3 percent, to $495.7 million for the quarter, compared with nearly $518 million a year ago. 
 Analysts said the Denver-based company had performed impressively given the impact of the recession on its key businesses and of Brazil's anti-inflation program on Manville's large forest products operations in that country. Manville makes building products, paperboard packaging and fiber glass for industrial applications and also has substantial mining operations.
"They almost broke even at a time when you would have expected them to get thrashed," said Chriss W. Street , an analyst with the Reorganized Securities Group in Los Angeles who has followed the company since its emergence from bankruptcy in 1988.
In February, Manville received $15 million in damages and $25 million in interest to settle a judgment against the Guardian Industries Corporation of Northville, Mich.
As part of its reorganization, Manville is to start paying a dividend next year equivalent to 20 percent of its profits to the trust fund set up to handle claims against the company by asbestos victims. The recent quarter was the first in which the company began accruing profits for such payments and, in accord with the definitions of income in the agreement, $8.1 million was set aside, according to yesterday's report.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Makes Strong Gains On Positive Economic Signs

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar surged on world currency markets yesterday amid a backdrop of positive news that hinted the United States economy might be ready to rebound from recession.
Gold prices fell worldwide. On the New York Commodity Exchange, gold bullion for current delivery declined $3.90 an ounce to settle at $357.90. The Republic National Bank quoted a late bid for gold of $357.50 an ounce, off $3.35 from Wednesday. 
 The dollar advanced in Europe and continued to climb in domestic markets.
Traders were initially encouraged that Germany's Bundesbank did not raise interest rates, as many traders had anticipated. A tightening of German credit would have enhanced the value of mark-denominated securities at the expense of United States fixed-income investments and thus the dollar.
Further, traders were encouraged by a United States Government report showing that initial jobless claims for the week ended April 6 fell 22,000, contrary to market expectations that they would rise.
Traders were also encouraged by a narrowing of the United States merchandise trade deficit, which shrunk to $5.33 billion in February, the smallest gap in more than seven years.
"This means the U.S. economy is moving more into balance," said Marc Chandler, an analyst with the firm IDEA. "This combination of factors encouraged the market to test the upside of the dollar's trading range."
The dollar jumped against the German currency in New York trading to 1.7052 marks, from 1.6684 the day before.
Against the Japanese currency, the dollar settled at 137.80 yen in New York, up from 136.19 yen on Wednesday. In earlier Tokyo trading, the dollar rose 1.30 yen to a closing 136.27 yen. Later in London, it was quoted at a higher rate of 136.75 yen.
In London, the British pound fell to $1.7715, from $1.7835 late Wednesday. In New York it cost $1.7520 to buy one pound, less expensive than Wednesday's $1.7865.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Wednesday's rates, included: 1.4570 Swiss francs, up from 1.4225; 5.7615 French francs, up from 5.6430; 1,262.00 Italian lire, up from 1,237.00, and 1.1523 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1503.
Silver prices also lost ground. On New York's Comex, silver bullion for current delivery settled at $3.939 an ounce, down from $4.087 on Wednesday.

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
Why the Markets Are So Optimistic

BYLINE: By Leonard Silk

 BODY:
WHAT'S going on? It's hard to remember a time of so much confusion on the state of the economy and the financial markets. These questions are being asked:
Q. The Dow has hit 3,000. But what is the basis for this optimism?
A. The expectation that the economy will soon turn up, but so gradually that inflation will come down, so the Federal Reserve will lower interest rates to support the recovery and keep the White House off its back.
Q. But isn't the Fed torn by internal dissension over whether to lower interest rates?
A. There are such conflicts, although some insiders insist they are exaggerated. David D. Hale, chief economist and chief Fed watcher of Kemper Financial Services, said: "Despite all the recent publicity about divisions within the Federal Open Market Committee about the role of the chairman in deciding when to lower interest rates, there is a general recognition that the economy is still weak, and policy remains asymmetrically biased toward ease."
Q. Does the Treasury see it that way? Wouldn't the Treasury like to see the Fed ease interest rates further and faster?
A. Yes it would. The Treasury has made no secret of its leaning on the Fed for greater ease, to help break the credit crunch.
Q. Is there a credit crunch?
A. Some economists insist that loans are off because of weak demand. But Deputy Secretary of the Treasury John Robson is certain there is a crunch. "I've gone around the country talking to many kinds of businessmen, and not just in the Northeast, and they tell me there's not enough credit available," he said in an interview yesterday. "They tell me there's a lack of willingness on the part of the banks to step in and lend or even renew credits already extended -- they're cutting people off in the middle of the movie."
Q. What is the cause of the crunch?
A. Mr. Robson said it has four causes: "The economic downturn and the deteriorated collateral of many borrowers; the weakened condition of the banks, now trying to strengthen their capital positions by stopping loans; the regulators, who are being too tough on the banks, and the Fed, still holding interest rates too high." He added: "Inflation is not the threat today. Growth is the issue."
Q. Do the regulators admit they are being too tough?
A. No. The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the Federal Reserve, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Office of Thrift Supervision jointly issued a statement declaring: "We do not want the availability of credit to sound borrowers to be adversely affected by supervisory misunderstandings about them."
Q. With recovery ahead, can we breathe easily about the condition of the banks? Or could there be a replay of the savings and loan debacle?
A. Bank failures have been rising among smaller institutions, but the Administration and the General Accounting Office both support the "too big to fail" doctrine. The Administration says there is no comparability between the commercial banks and the savings and loans; it maintains that the banks are far better capitalized and are not riddled with fraud, as were many savings institutions.
The Administration believes that, with less regulation and new powers to expand across state lines and enter the insurance and securities businesses, the banks can safely expand. Its critics, led by the G.A.O., insist that the banks must first put their houses and balance sheets in order before they can be trusted to expand into new lines. But the Treasury's Mr. Robson blasts the regulators for "regulating with a chain saw."
Q. Has the stock market concluded that in any contest between the Administration and the regulators the Administration has the big guns and will win?"
A. So it seems. The Administration has made liquidating the recession its prime objective. Worsening labor market conditions in March and early April, declines in hours worked, continued weakness in retail spending, slipping housing starts, trims in business inventories, sluggish business plans to invest in new plant and equipment -- all these imply that the economy is still in recession.
The White House wants monetary policy to reinforce fiscal policy to lift the economy out of the slump. The budget deficit is projected to reach nearly $300 billion in the fiscal year 1991 and $290 billion in fiscal year 1992. Even for a non-Keynesian Administration, that ain't hay in the stimulus department.
But a two-year deficit of nearly $600 billion has the traditionalists on the Federal Open Market Committee worrying about inflation. Mr. Greenspan, the peace keeper, is trying to keep the Administration content, without facing an open revolt within the Fed. and without regenerating inflation. This week the stock market was betting it his way.

HEADLINE: New Jobless-Benefit Claims Drop for 2d Straight Week

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 18

 BODY:
New claims for unemployment benefits fell for the second consecutive week, the Labor Department said today.
Some economists said the report suggested the end of the recession was in sight. But others said it was too soon to tell, adding that next week's jobless claims would be a critical number to watch. 
 The Labor Department said the number of Americans filing for inital unemployment benefits dropped 22,000, to a seasonally adjusted 451,000, in the first week of April.
The previous week, claims dropped by 70,000, to 473,000, after soaring to the highest level in more than eight years, the department said.
"I'm inclined to interpret the number as one of the first palpable signs of the recovery," said Fred Sturm, senior economist at Fuji Securities Inc. "The weekly jobless claims could fall below 400,000 in short order."
Evelina Tainer, an economist at First National Bank of Chicago, said the nation's two previous recessions followed a similar pattern in which jobless claims peaked about six to eight weeks before the economy began to turn around.
"If you apply similar behavior to this cycle, it suggests we'll get a recovery in late May or early June," she said.
Despite the decline in initial weekly claims, the number actually receiving benefits under regular state unemployment programs jumped 183,000, to 3.5 million, for the week ended March 30, the latest period for which that figure was available.
Economists said they expected that rise because continued claims typically lagged behind the initial unemployment claim number.
But some economists said that the weekly jobless claims were a volatile number and that this week's fall could have been helped by the Easter holiday week.

HEADLINE: Cholera Kills 1,100 in Peru and Marches On, Reaching the Brazilian Border

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: RIO DE JANEIRO, April 18

 BODY:
A fast-moving cholera epidemic that has killed 1,100 Peruvians and sickened 150,000 since January has spread to Ecuador and Colombia. Isolated cases have been reported in Chile and the United States, but perhaps the greatest concern is for Brazil, Latin America's most populous nation.
"It's gigantic," said Myron M. Levine, an American epidemiologist who has studied cholera epidemics in Asia and Africa over the last 20 years. "It's really a big epidemic." 
 In the first major outbreak in the Americas in this century, cholera has found in South America a population that has little natural resistance and is highly vulnerable because of a widespread lack of clean drinking water and proper sewage disposal.
The results can be seen in the crowded cholera wards of the state-run Dos de Mayo Hospital in Lima, the Peruvian capital. Earlier this month, cholera admissions hit 162 a day, going off the upper edge of a blackboard chart maintained by the hospital director.
 
A Fateful Cup of Tea
 "I bought a cup of herbal tea from a street vendor, and an hour later I was throwing up," said Oscar Clemente Paredes Rosales, interviewed in his hospital bed as an overhead serum bottle dripped dextrose solution into his right arm. Mr. Paredes, a 33-year-old truck driver, lay in a former women's ward recently relabeled "Cholera II" by a hurried staff member.
His wife, Maria Elena, said, "Two people on our block died of cholera." Residents of their shantytown neighborhood draw water from a communal well.
Disease control experts are largely at a loss to explain why cholera has returned to South America in the first epidemic since 1895. In the 1970's, the disease spread from West Africa down to Angola, a former Portuguese colony. Epidemiologists expected it to jump across the South Atlantic to Portuguese-speaking Brazil, but the South American epidemic never happened.
Spread largely by contact with human feces, the cholera bacillus can kill a person in 10 hours. Through vomiting and diarrhea, infected people can lose 10 percent of their weight in one night. The disease is easily treated with rehydration salts and intravenous solutions, but in remote areas many Peruvians are 10 hours from an adequately supplied health clinic.
The speed and destructiveness of the disease in Peru is a reflection of the explosion of the urban poor there. From a city of one million people in the 1950's, Lima has grown to seven million people, about one third of Peru's population.
With terrorism, hyperinflation and foreign debt obligations causing the economy to shrink in recent years, the city government can barely maintain existing water and sewer systems, much less expand the network of pipes to half of the city that now does without.
Cholera bacteria spread in February to neighboring Ecuador. With the disease now present in half of Ecuador's 21 provinces, health officials there say that 3,500 people have fallen ill with cholera and 18 have died. The Ecuadorean Medical Federation, a private group, says the real toll is 5,000 ill and over 100 dead.
In March, the epidemic moved up the Pacific coast to Colombia, reaching two ports, then jumped 450 miles inland to the Amazon territory of Guaviare. So far, 113 Colombians have fallen ill, and 2 have died.
This week, one confirmed case was reported in Santiago, Chile. In the United States, one confirmed case of cholera and two suspected cases have been linked the Peru outbreak.
Epidemiologists interviewed here said they saw no reason why the disease should not continue to spread, hitting Brazil and Central America.
 
Disease's Route Is 'Guesswork'
 "There is no mechanism to avoid that it goes to other countries," said Carlos M. Cuneo, an Argentine sanitation expert who represents the Pan American Health Organization here.
Dr. Levine, who works for the University of Maryland School of Medicine, cautioned, "It's pure guesswork as to where it is going."
Today, Brazilians' fears materialized after Brazil's Health Ministry reported one confirmed case and three suspected cases in Tabatinga and Benjamin Constant, Amazon border towns that trade heavily with Colombia and Peru.
The nightmare for Brazilian doctors, who have flocked to Lima recently on study missions, is that the epidemic will spread through the Amazon to the slums of Brazil's overcrowded coastal cities. Many health authorities fear that in the warm, unsanitary slums of Brazil and Peru, cholera could become endemic, recurring year after year as it does in India and Bangladesh.
About 20 percent of cholera victims need hospitalization. With the Health Ministry in Lima reporting 147,980 cases, 600,000 additional Peruvians are, or have been, "healthy carriers" -- people who are infected but show no symptoms. With many hospital workers on strike in April, cases are believed to be underreported by as much as 10 percent.
In general, experts praise Peru's doctors for keeping the death rate at under 1 percent, well below the 8 percent average for cholera epidemics in Bangladesh. On the other hand, the experts have criticized Peru's political leadership for seeking to minimize the epidemic to reduce its impact on Peru's food and tourism industries.
"The public information campaign was a disaster," said Uriel Garcia Caceres, a medical doctor who served as Peru's Health Minister in the early 1980's.
Evidently under pressure from Peru's powerful fishing industry, President Alberto K. Fujimori, his wife, Susana, and his ministers of fisheries and of agriculture went on television eating ceviche, a dish prepared by marinating raw fish in lemon juice. Trying to revive tourism, the President also played host to 20 foreign correspondents for a lunch of ceviche and sashimi at a beachfront restaurant.
Within days, hospital admissions for cholera soared. One patient reportedly was the Fisheries Minister, Felix Canal, who spent a week in a military hospital. Through a spokesman, the minister denied that he had fallen ill with cholera, saying he had a bad case of laryngitis.
 
'Ceviche War' Breaks Out
 In what became known as the "ceviche war," Health Minister Carlos Vidal Layseca resigned in mid-March, charging, "There is one ceviche for the rich, and another ceviche for the poor."
With confusing messages coming from the authorities, the epidemic took on a second life during the Easter Week holiday here, when people traditionally eat fish and travel through the country visiting relatives.
In March the epidemic took root in the central Andes, and in April it started to descend into Peru's Amazon. In Iquitos, the largest Amazon city, there have been 418 cases and 18 deaths.
 
U.S. Case Linked to Peru
 In the United States, one case of cholera has been traced to the epidemic in Peru, the Federal Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta said. An American physician visiting Lima contracted the disease this month after eating undercooked crabmeat and drinking contaminated water. Two cases of severe diarrhea in Miami among people who recently visited South America are being investigated by the centers, but cholera has not been confirmed.
"I would not be surprised to see a number of cases of cholera in Americans traveling to South America, but I don't expect really large numbers," said Dr. Paul Blake, an epidemiologist at the centers.
He said travelers should not drink untreated water and should eat cooked foods while they are still hot. Ice cubes should also be avoided.
"It is very unlikely that cholera will reach epidemic proportions in the United States," Dr. Blake said, "because although our water and sewer systems are not perfect, they are good enough to make us unreceptive to mass transmission of the disease."

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Prices of Treasury Issues Tumble

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
Suggestions that the steady rise in unemployment may be slowing and a press report that the Federal Reserve Board decided last month to stop easing monetary policy sent prices of Treasury securities down sharply yesterday.
The report on the Fed appeared in The Washington Post yesterday. 
 "That got the market jittery," one trader said, "and when the claims numbers came out, that was the catalyst to sell."
The Labor Department reported that initial unemployment claims fell by 22,000, to 451,000, in the first week in April. It was the second straight week that initial claims figures, a statistic that is often an accurate indicator of movement in the unemployment rate reported each month, had declined.
"I am not going to try to over-analyze these numbers," said Joseph Liro, a senior vice president and money market economist at S. G. Warburg & Company. "But if they stay down at these levels for another couple of weeks, we may have something."
Although traders reacted to The Washington Post article by selling short-term securities like Treasury bills, analysts said the report added little to recently published reports suggesting that Fed governors are divided over the future course of monetary policy.
The analysts added that the Fed's recent actions made it plain that for the moment the Fed has no plans to ease monetary policy.
"The Fed's actions on Monday made it obvious that they had voted against ease," said Donald J. Fine, chief market analyst at the Chase Manhattan Corporation. "But it could just as easily be true that if the next set of economic data are weak, the Fed will ease policy again. I am a little surprised that the market reacted the way it did."
 
Bank Reserves Drained
 On Monday, the Fed doused expectations that it was about to lower short-term interest rates when it entered the open market for Treasury securities an hour earlier than normal and drained reserves from the banking system by selling Treasury issues.
Once the Fed took that step, most analysts said the Fed was unlikely to revisit the issue of whether to cut its discount rate and the overnight Federal funds rate until the middle of May. By then, the Government will have delivered reports on how employment conditions and important inflation measurements fared in April.
"I doubt very much they will do much before the next meeting of the Open Market Committee, which is on May 14," Mr. Liro said. "If we get a set of numbers that match the ones we saw from March, a development I expect, I would think the Fed would take another pop."
Market participants were nevertheless fairly big sellers of Treasury issues yesterday.
By late in the day, the 7 7/8 percent 30-year bonds of 2021 were offered at a price of 96 21/32, down 25/32, to yield 8.17 percent, up from 8.10 percent late Wednesday.
Among note issues, the 7 3/4 percent 10-year notes were offered at 98 6/32, down 15/32, to yield 8.01 percent. And the 7 1/8 percent two-year notes were offered at 100 10/32, down 5/32, to yield 6.94 percent.
With the prospect of a quick move by the Fed to lower short-term rates all but obliterated, Treasury bill rates, which had declined in anticipation of such a move last week, rose sharply.
In late trading, three-month bills were offered at a discount rate of 5.70 percent, up 16 basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point. Six-month bill rates rose by 10 basis points, to a late offered rate of 5.71 percent.
In other developments, the the RJR Nabisco Capital Corporation priced and sold a $1.5 billion offering of seven-year senior notes in the high-yield "junk bond" market.
The size of the offering was twice what had initially been projected, but investment bankers at Merrill Lynch & Company, one of the lead underwriters, said demand for the issue was so strong that it was oversubscribed at the $1.5 billion level.
In the secondary market for investment-grade corporate bonds, traders said that prices of most issues fell by 1/4 point to 3/8 point.
Participants in the secondary market for tax-exempt municipal bonds said that prices of most widely quoted issues fell by 1/4 point to 3/8 point.
In other developments, the Federal Reserve Board reported yesterday that the two broadest measures of the nation's money supply rose in the week ended April 8. M-1, the narrowest measure, fell by $10 billion.
The money supply report had no impact on prices in the credit markets.

HEADLINE: Trade Gap Narrows to 7-Year Low

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 18

 BODY:
Paced by a big drop in the bill for imported oil, the nation's trade deficit shriveled to $5.3 billion in February, the smallest in more than seven years, the Commerce Department reported today.
Although exports fell slightly, imports fell three times as much to chop the deficit -- the amount by which the country's purchases of foreign goods exceed its sales abroad -- by $1.8 billion, or 26 percent. 
 Private economists joined the Bush Administration in hailing the improvement, even though the report did little to dispel uncertainty about when the economy would begin to pull out of recession. Trade figures not only move erratically but are also reported with a greater lag than most indicators.
 
'Very Satisfying' Numbers
 "These numbers are very satisfying," said James Annable, chief economist for the First National Bank of Chicago. "We're reducing imports and that's what ought to happen" in recession, he said, adding that exports remained relatively strong.
Commerce Secretary Robert A. Mosbacher issued a statement that while oil was a major factor in the improvement -- accounting for about 60 percent of the reduction in the gap and 40 percent of the decline in imports -- "continued high levels of exports reflect favorable longer-run developments" in support of economic growth.
The trade sector has clearly been cushoning the recession, Mr. Annable also declared, noting that without trade improvement, the gross national product would have fallen at a 5 percent annual pace in the fourth quarter of 1990 instead of the 1.6 percent decline that was recorded with it. The Government's first estimate of first-quarter G.N.P. is to be published next Friday.
 
Analysts Begin to Fret
 Some analysts, however, are beginning to fret about what may be a softening in exports, which are being counted on to help revive the economy later this year.
They noted that, on a three-month moving average, exports fell for the second straight month in February, to $33.7 billion, after climbing to a peak of $34.2 billion in December.
"Growth in exports has really been flattening out," said Jeffrey J. Schott, a research fellow at the Institute of International Economics. He noted that not only was growth slowing abroad but that the dollar was also rising in world currency markets, factors that would tend to inhibit future export sales.
Rimmer de Vries, chief economist for the Morgan Guaranty Trust Company, said that while he was generally encouraged by converging trends in trade -- shrinkage both in German and other European surpluses and in American deficits --the United States should not count on selling increased amounts of goods overseas.
"We are not going to have robust exports," Mr. de Vries declared.
The $800 million decline in February exports, to $33.5 billion, included an $800 million drop in capital goods and a $600 million decline in motor vehicles, parts and engines. This was partly offset by a $500 million increase in exports of foods, feeds and beverages and a $300 million increase in industrial supplies and materials.
The import drop of $2.6 billion included a $1.9 billion drop in industrial supplies and materials -- $1.1 billion of which represented smaller volumes and lower prices for imported oil. The country bought 153 million barrels at an average of $18.58 each in February, down from 170 million barrels at $22.98 in January.
 
Big Drop in Car Imports
 Imports also included a $500 million decline for motor vehicles, with about 10 percent of the decrease coming in new cars from Japan.
Oil accounted for some 53 percent of the February deficit, down from 55 percent the month before, the figures also showed.
By geographical area, the nation's trade surpluses with Western Europe and Eastern Europe widened in February by $250 million and $200 million, respectively, while its deficit with Japan narrowed by $300 million, to $3.2 billion. The deficit with Canada, the biggest single trading partner, widened $30 million.
The American position improved against all four of the newly industrialized countries of the Far East, with the aggregate deficit cut almost in half to $560 million. The United States swung into surplus with both South Korea and Singapore and cut the deficit with Hong Kong to $25 million. The deficit with Taiwan contracted nearly $200 million, to $675 million.
The nation's trade surplus in advanced technology products, however, eroded $800 million, to $2.4 billion, with lower exports accounting for more than half the deterioration. For the first two months of 1991, exports of these important products are barely ahead of the comparable period of last year -- $14.7 billion against $14.6 billion, the report showed.
Before seasonal adjustment, the overall deficit last month was $4.5 billion, a 36 percent improvement, compared with the 26 percent improvement in the deficit when adjusted for recurring seasonal factors.
On a three-month average, the deficit fell to $6.3 billion at latest reading from $7.5 billion in January.
The $5.3 billion February deficit was the smallest since September 1983 and was just below the gap for last June, which had previously been revised. In constant 1987 dollars, the gap was $4.4 billion, down from $5.3 billion the month before and from $6.1 billion in February 1990.

American Express Reports $264 Million Quarterly Profit

BYLINE: By KURT EICHENWALD

 BODY:
Hurt by a deteriorating economy and a falloff in travel, the American Express Company yesterday reported earnings of $264 million, or 55 cents a share, for the quarter just ended. The company lost $620 million in the first quarter of 1990, reflecting record losses at Shearson Lehman Hutton, its brokerage unit that is now called Shearson Lehman Brothers.
The company's quarterly revenues were up 6.4 percent, to $6.29 billion, from $5.91 billion. 
 In a sign of its difficulties, American Express said it was adding $50 million to provisions for credit problems in its Travel Related Services unit, the heart of the company, which manages its familiar charge card.
"American Express serves the affluent part of the American economy, and it looks like the affluent are really in recession now," said John Keefe, an analyst with the Lipper Analytical Securities Corporation.
To combat falling revenues from its charge-card business, American Express is planning to lower the rates paid by restaurants that accept the card, people who have been briefed on the company's plan said yesterday. The cut, expected to be announced by the company this quarter, would be available only to restaurants that report charges to the company through new electronic systems instead of the traditional paper slips. Consumers will still receive paper receipts.
Analysts also said the performance of Shearson was also relatively poor, given increased activity by individual investors. But both IDS Financial Services -- which sells mutual funds, investment certificates, life insurance and other financial products -- and the Information Services Corporation data-processing unit had record quarterly earnings.
American Express's share price ended yesterday at $29.25, off 62.5 cents, on the New York Stock Exchange.
Travel Related Services reported income down 24.7 percent, to $162 million from $215 million.
James D. Robinson 3d, the chairman and chief executive of the company, blamed the division's performance on the Persian Gulf conflict and a domestic slowdown. "Travel and tourism were severely disrupted by the war," Mr. Robinson said, "and the recession took a toll on consumer spending. "Rising unemployment pushed up credit losses."
 
Increase in Unpaid Debts
 The company said rising unemployment, business failures and personal bankruptcies increased unpaid debts at the Travel Related Services division, leading to the increased credit provisions. The unit's quarterly revenues of $2.4 billion rose 7.3 percent from last year, primarily because of higher revenues from finance charges on the company's Optima cards and consumer lending.
The company said it expected weak consumer spending and other factors to leave the travel unit lagging "below traditional growth rates."
Shearson earned $51 million in the first quarter, compared with a quarterly loss of $915 million last year. The investment firm's revenues were $2.8 billion, up from $2.6 billion a year ago. The firm's total expenses were $2.7 billion, unchanged from a year ago; its fixed expenses fell to $620 million, from $710 million.
American Express reported that its IDS Financial Services division had record earnings in the quarter of $51 million, up 18 percent from the first quarter of 1990. The unit's assets under management reached $32 billion, compared with $27 billion in the first quarter of last year.
The company's Information Services Corporation earned a record $25 million, an increase of 17 percent over the first quarter of 1990.

HEADLINE: In New York City, Altering School Aid Insures a Fight

BYLINE: By JOSEPH BERGER

 BODY:
Any effort by President Bush to change the formula for allocating Federal aid to poor students -- known as Chapter 1 funds -- is sure to inflame passions in New York City.
For one thing, the program is a major source of educational financing -- $334 million out of a $6.5 billion budget. It pays for many, if not most, of the city's remedial English and mathematics teachers, as well as many of its bilingual teachers, guidance counselors and paraprofessionals. It also pays for a summer program for elementary school students. 
 Every school wants a piece of the pie, and so the formula has been a perennial subject of debate. In recent years, advocates for the poor have argued that the money has been spread too thin and has ended up helping poor students in largely middle-class schools when it should be concentrated in the schools with the most needy students.
A compromise was fashioned last year, somewhat narrowing the number of schools that receive Chapter 1 aid. But many advocates are still not satisfied. Chapter 1 money is allocated to individual schools that qualify. In New York City, 626 out of its 984 schools receive such money.
At a news conference yesterday, the Secretary of Education, Lamar Alexander, said he would introduce legislation to enable Chapter 1 money to follow a poor child if the child transferred to another school, even if it was a private or parochial one. He said this would be part of his plan to give parents greater choice over their children's schools.
A proposal to let Federal dollars follow students to private schools could strip the city's school system of substantial funds at a time when it is already reeling under proposed cuts of $505 million in state and city money.
"Of course we would oppose it," said James S. Vlasto, press secretary to the city's Schools Chancellor, Joseph A. Fernandez, referring to such a plan.
 
A Free-Lunch Standard
 Mr. Vlasto said that at present, any school can receive Chapter 1 money if 54.1 percent of its students qualify for a free lunch or receive welfare payments under the Aid for Dependent Children program. The money must be spent only on classes and services for children who qualify unless a school's poverty rate exceeds 75 percent. In that case, the school can spend the money on programs for all its children.
David Jones, president of the Community Service Society, an advocacy group for the poor, said he would oppose any effort to have money follow individual children, particularly to private schools. He argued that money must be targeted at the worst concentrations of poverty so it can help attack problems like unemployment and family disruption that seem to spread throughout a community.
"There's a real potential to siphon off money from school districts that are already suffering extraordinary problems," he said. "I have a million children in the public school system, and sure I want a couple to end up at Choate. But that doesn't deal with the hundreds of thousands of children in the South Bronx."

HEADLINE: For Unions, Small Gain and New Worries in Rail Strike

BYLINE: By PETER T. KILBORN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 18

 BODY:
President Bush wanted the Democratic leadership of Congress to stop the railroad strike before it began. The leadership, honoring organized labor's right to strike, refused.
 But for labor, it was the slimmest and least satisfying of victories. Congress stopped the strike Wednesday night after just one day, while the paint was still wet on the picket signs and before the unions could force concessions from management. 
 "We prefer that Congress not get into the picture and let us fight it out," said Richard I. Kilroy, president of the Transportation Communications Union and chairman of the Railroad Labor Executives Association, a lobbying group of union leaders. "It didn't happen, but it was not totally unexpected."
Since President Ronald Reagan's first term, support of organized labor in Congress, not just the White House, has eroded, and the abbreviated strike against the nation's freight railroads demonstrates it anew.
 
Labor Unhappy Over New Board
 Congress stopped the strike, but it did not settle it. It created a special three-member board and empowered President Bush to appoint the members from a list recommended by the nonpartisan National Mediation Board. The new board will take over from a Presidential emergency board, which in January recommended solutions to the disputes that have divided the railroads and their workers for three years and in some cases longer. After hearing their differences, the new board is to impose a settlement in 65 days.
What galls labor is that the new board must use the recommendations of the old board as the guidelines for the settlement. The unions contended that the old board's recommendations were tilted toward management. While railroad officials said they had wanted more than they got from the old board, they were clearly happier with the recommendations than labor was.
Unions today refrained from blaming Congress directly for the rules it set for the board or for moving so quickly to stop the strike. The locomotive engineers union charged that management created unnecessary public anxiety about the strike by stopping Amtrak's passenger service on long-distance lines. Such management action and White House collaboration left Congress no choice but to act, union leaders said. "We believe that Congress all along wanted, as we did, a negotiated settlement, but management would not allow it," said Larry D. McFather, president of the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers.
Mac A. Fleming, president of the Brotherhood of Maintenance of Way Employees, called the legislation stopping the strike "vastly disappointing and unfair."
 
Strikes Hold Big Risks
 "It is a process which the railroads have been able to manipulate in order to drive what should be our private collective bargaining issues into the public lap of Congress," Mr. Fleming said.
Congress or the White House almost always intervenes in large railroad strikes because of the risks they can pose for the economy in halting as much as 37 percent of all freight transportation.
"The argument that the strike would have been extremely harmful to the economy is pretty self-evident," said Representative Al Swift, a Washington Democrat who is chairman of the House subcommittee that prepared the legislation to end the strike. "That was a driving force behind it."
But a reason they were able to move fast is that organized labor's influence over Congress has diminished, as the share of Americans who are union members has declined, to 16 percent now from about 25 percent in the 1950's.
"I consider myself to be a representative of the blue-collar workers of America," said Representative Jim Slattery, a Kansas Democrat who is a member of the House subcommittee that wrote the bill to stop the strike.
 
Decline of Labor's Power
 "But there are two basic factors to keep in mind," he said. "One is that the number of workers who are members of labor unions has dramatically declined. In many Congressional districts there are more small businessmen and women than there are members of labor unions.
"Second, in the last ten years, with the emergence of political action committees, the Democratic Party is less dependent on the contributions of organized labor than it was 15 years ago."
Mr. Slattery also noted that he could not ignore the interests of the struck railroad that plies the Kansas cornfields, the Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe. "Forty percent of the Santa Fe's business is sensitive to truck competition," he said, and in a strike that business, and the railroad's jobs, could be permanently lost.
Off the record, other Democrats cite another reason for moving quickly -- the 1992 election. They hope the economy and the Republicans' management of it will give them a winning issue. "But if we have permitted a big strike the President could blame us for the damage to the economy," said a Democrat who was involved in the negotiations about the legislation. "We want to avoid falling into that trap," he said.
 
Rail Strikes Are Different
 Railroad strikes, like strikes by police officers and hospital workers, are different from other strikes because of their effect on uninvolved people, so Government intervention is often necessary. President Bush refused a Congressional request to intervene in another strike, the one that ultimately helped bring the collapse of Eastern Airlines, in part because people could use other airlines.
With the railroad strike stopped, organized labor can look to another big issue for a test of Congressional loyalty. The top item on the A.F.L.-C.I.O.'s legislative agenda this year is a bill to stop employers from permanently hiring people to replace strikers, leaving the workers on the street even after the end of a strike.
That practice, used by companies like Eastern Airlines, Greyhound Lines and the International Paper Company, terrifies unions because it deprives them of their mightiest weapon, the strike, in much the same way that Congress's intervention in the railroad walkout did.

HEADLINE: JAPAN-SOVIET PACT ON ISLANDS ELUSIVE

BYLINE: By STEVEN R. WEISMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, Friday, April 19

 BODY:
In marathon negotiations that churned until nearly midnight, President Mikhail S. Gorbachev of the Soviet Union and Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu of Japan failed on Thursday to resolve a territorial dispute dividing their countries since World War II.
The two leaders finished their three days of talks with praise for each other's sincerity, pledges that progress might be made in the future, and promises of future cooperation -- but nothing near the breakthrough which Mr. Kaifu, at least, had said he sought. 
 The two leaders concluded their meetings by signing 15 agreements on subjects ranging from trade fairs, establishment of cultural centers, air rights, fishery accords and other minor matters. Conspicuous by its absence was any talk of large-scale Japanese economic cooperation.
Mr. Gorbachev did make a few small concessions on the issue of a group of islands in the Kurile chain north of Japan. He formally agreed that the islands, which the Soviet Union seized in the closing days of World War II, were a proper subject of accelerated talks.
In addition, the Soviet leader agreed to reduce military forces on the islands, estimated by Japan at about 10,000 troops, and to recognize indirectly Japan's claim to the smallest islands in the group.
But basically, the leaders of two of the most powerful countries in the world showed themselves unable to muster the political strength to untangle a disagreement over a microscopic bit of territory of negligible strategic value to either country.
Their disagreement meant that Tokyo and Moscow would continue to stay at odds in spite of the "new world order" hailed in Washington. Mr. Gorbachev was seen as unable to compromise because of fears of encouraging secessionism or angering the military.
 
Ties to Moscow
 Mr. Kaifu, on the other hand, faces overwhelming support in Japan for getting the islands back, underscored by a lack of popular urgency for improving ties with Moscow. Especially eager to get the islands are rightists who are a vital constituency of the governing Liberal Democratic Party.
Early this morning, both leaders held separate news conferences declaring they had deepened their mutual understanding but admitting they had a long way to go before they could sign a peace treaty or contemplate major Japanese economic aid and investment in the Soviet Union.
Mr. Gorbachev, sounding restrained and somewhat frustrated, said he was "quite satisfied at the effort that has been done here" but that "everything is still ahead of us."
 
Obscure Issue, Big Effort
 The Soviet leader also noted that he and Mr. Kaifu had spent 12 hours face-to-face since his arrival Tuesday, most of it on the territorial issue, and that he could not remember any negotiation so arduous and extensive on such a technically obscure topic.
Mr. Kaifu and Japanese officials sought at their briefings to make the point that in small ways, the Soviet Union had moved away from its earlier intransigence in insisting on retaining sovereignty over three islands and a group of islets north of Japan seized by Moscow at the end of World War II.
In particular, Mr. Kaifu said it was significant that a joint statement by the two leaders referred specifically to all the islands -- Etorofu, Kunashiri, Shikotan and the Habomai group of islets -- as a subject for negotiation.
Moreover, the Soviet Union agreed to a favorable reference in the joint statement to a 1956 accord between the Moscow and Tokyo that recognized Japan's sovereignty over Shikotan and the Habomai group. Moscow later rescinded this view when Japan signed a security treaty with the United States.
"I believe that the reference to these matters is itself a matter of achievement," Mr. Kaifu told reporters this morning. "Names that had never been printed before were recognized as an issue that does exist."
But before the meeting had began, many Japanese diplomats said that if the entire current exercise had simply reiterated the old 1956 accord, the meetings themselves could not be considered a success.
 
Assertion of Progress
 A Foreign Ministry official, asked if Japan was disappointed, replied: "I don't think there is disappointment because the problem is very clearly identified. And what has become clear is that President Gorbachev is indeed very seriously trying to grapple with this issue."
Mr. Gorbachev was supposed to have seen more of Tokyo today, but instead he canceled his public appearances and worked through most of the day at the State Guest House.
Mr. Gorbachev and his wife, Raisa, are scheduled to wind up their visit to Japan today with a ride on the bullet train to the western city of Kyoto. Then the Soviet leader is to fly to Nagasaki to visit graves of Russian sailors.

HEADLINE: COMPANY EARNINGS;
3 of 4 Bell Companies Post Drop in Earnings

BYLINE: By BARNABY J. FEDER

 BODY:
Four more regional telephone companies of the eight created by the breakup of the American Telephone and Telegraph Company in 1984 reported first-quarter earnings yesterday suggesting that the recession had stunted their growth. The reports were in line with the trend established earlier in the week.
The Nynex Corporation, which serves New York and the New England states, was the hardest hit. Net income slipped 7.5 percent, disappointing analysts, and revenue was up only because of rate increases. 
 The Bell Atlantic Corporation, which serves the Atlantic coast states from New Jersey to Virginia along with West Virginia, was the only one of the four companies whose earnings, which dipped a bit, were in line with Wall Street projections.
The BellSouth Corporation, which serves nine Southeastern states, said its net income declined 4.9 percent, more than forecast, under pricing pressure from regulators and because of acquisition costs. U S West Inc., which serves 14 states from the Northwest to Minnesota and down to Arizona, said that its net income rose 5.1 percent because of gains in its non-telephone businesses. That was at the lower end of analysts' projections.
"It's more of what we saw in the fourth quarter 1990 earnings," said Jack Grubman, who follows the phone companies for Paine Webber. "They are more sensitive to the economy than people thought before then."
Following are the details of the companies' results:
 
Bell Atlantic
Bell Atlantic said that it had a net income in the first quarter of $353.6 million, a shade lower than the $355.3 million it earned a year ago. Earnings per share edged up 1 cent, to 91 cents, because of an accounting technicality related to dividends paid to shares held in the company's employee stock ownership plan. Revenues for the quarter were also essentially flat at $3 billion, compared with $3.02 billion a year ago.
The Philadelphia-based company said new Federal price cap regulations reduced income by $45 million. Bell Atlantic's shares fell 12.5 cents, to $49, in trading on the Big Board.
 
BellSouth
BellSouth said that its net income declined 4.9 percent in the quarter, to $402.3 million, or 83 cents a share, from $423.2 million, or 88 cents a share, a year ago, partly because of regulatory changes that would continue to affect earnings throughout 1991.
The company said that the Federal price cap rules shaved $14 million from its revenue in the quarter, while rate reductions ordered in Georgia, Tennessee, and Mississippi reduced revenue by $42 million. The company's share price fell 87.5 cents, to finish at $51.25, in trading on the Big Board yesterday.
 
U S West
U S West said that net income grew 5.1 percent, to $285.9 million in the first quarter, from $271.9 million a year ago. However, earnings per share were unchanged at 73 cents because the number of shares outstanding increased by 16.1 million. Revenues rose nearly 1 percent, to $2.45 billion, from $2.43 billion a year ago.
"Revenue from our telephone operations was essentially flat," said Richard McCormick, president and chief executive, citing rate reductions. But cellular and paging business grew strongly.
The company's share price finished unchanged, at $37.875, in trading on the Big Board.
 
Nynex
Nynex reported net income fell to $269.5 million, or $1.34 a share, from $291.4 million, or $1.46 a share, a year ago. Revenues rose 1.2 percent, to $3.36 billion, from $3.32 billion in the first three months of 1990.
Nynex said that the recession was especially tough on its telecommunications businesses, including New York Telephone, New England Telephone, and on its cellular operations. Operating income for the telephone companies declined 2.9 percent, to $607.1 million, from $625.5 million a year ago. Revenues were flat at $2.7 billion and would have declined 2 percent, if rate increases had not been allowed by New York State.
Nynex, which is based in White Plains, was the only Bell company to report a decline in cellular income, which fell 38.8 percent, to $9.3 million, from $15.2 million a year ago. The number of cellular customers grew 16.7 percent but use expanded only 4.1 percent, reflecting a sharp drop in use per customer.
Nynex's share price fell 37.5 cents, to close at $73.25 in trading on the Big Board.

HEADLINE: Poles Get $2.48 Billion More In Loans From the I.M.F.

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 18

 BODY:
The International Monetary Fund today approved an additional $2.48 billion in loans for Poland over the next three years. The decision coincided with concern at the agency that Eastern Europe's economic problems are more severe and less tractable than initially thought.
The region's economies are shrinking faster than predicted, inflation has stayed high and little foreign investment has materialized, I.M.F. officials said. Trade within the region, which was expected to fall sharply, has plunged. And a shortage of functioning banks and other financial institutions is making it difficult for private businesses to replace inefficient, state-owned monopolies, they said. 
 As a result, it will take two or more years before the economies of Eastern Europe even regain the size they had at the beginning of last year, said an I.M.F. official, who, like other officials, spoke on condition that he not be identified. He said the fund remained convinced that the region needs radical programs to replace central planning with markets.
 
'Comprehensive Approach' Urged
 "You do need to have a comprehensive approach, what has been called a 'big bang"' he said. "Piecemeal reform does not work."
The Polish package would bring the loans approved by the I.M.F. since the beginning of the year to a total of $8.4 billion for Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Poland and Romania.
Poland suffered one of the worst setbacks last year, as total economic output, adjusted for inflation, dropped 12 percent, I.M.F. officials said.
The Polish loan package includes $1.66 billion to help pay for changes in the economic structure, $220 million to cover the higher cost of oil since last September, and $600 million to pay for oil imports during future periods of high oil prices.
The Polish Government agreed in turn to limit its budget deficit and the expansion of credit, reduce inflation with a target of 1 percent a month later this year and to keep interest rates higher than the inflation rate.
"We have agreed on the program, and we had expected it to be approved because there were not many controversial things," said a Polish official who insisted on anonymity.
The agreement followed by a month the decision of the Paris Club, a group of Western creditor governments, to forgive half of Poland's $33 billion official debt, and Washington's decision to forgive 70 percent of the $3.8 billion debt owed to the United States. Those moves, however, were contingent on Poland's reaching an agreement with the I.M.F.
The I.M.F. approved a $700 million loan last year for Poland, but much of the money was never disbursed because inflation was 17 percent in the fourth quarter, which exceeded the I.M.F.'s target.
William R. Cline, a senior fellow at the Institute for International Economics, said the drastic steps Poland had already taken to reduce Government control over the economy were making it easier for the country to obtain loans. "It's pretty clear they've taken forceful, aggressive measures," he said.

HEADLINE: Market Place;
Global Oil Giants Expected to Surge

BYLINE: By Thomas C. Hayes

DATELINE: DALLAS

 BODY:
BIG international oil companies, including Exxon, Mobil and Royal Dutch/Shell, are expected to report a surge in first-quarter profits next week, but analysts say others that operate mainly in North America are likely to be less fortunate. ARCO and Unocal, among others, will probably post modest declines, they said.
Unlike the last three months of 1990, when war fears pushed crude prices up to an average near $30 a barrel and oil production units posted big earnings gains, profits in the exploration and production sector will probably be little changed for the first quarter from a year earlier. Oil producers received about $21 a barrel for their crude oil in the quarter, about the same as a year earlier. 
 But the Persian Gulf war's indirect impact on the global oil giants was potent because of the huge orders that Saudi officials placed with refiners to stockpile jet fuel, gasoline and other critical petroleum products before and during the war against Iraq, analysts said.
They project that overall profit gains for the big international companies will average more than 40 percent, mainly because their refining and marketing units in Europe, Singapore and Asia reaped a bonanza from military purchases.
Weather was also a factor, with colder temperatures gripping Europe, in contrast to a remarkably mild winter in most of the United States. The weather added to a run-up in natural gas prices that was already under way in Europe. Natural gas demand and prices plunged in the United States because of the warmer weather. Market values for global oil companies have increased nearly as much as the Standard & Poor's industrial index, which has risen 20 percent this year. From Jan. 1 through Wednesday, Exxon was up by 16 percent, Mobil by 17 percent and Texaco by 14 percent on the Big Board. Meanwhile, the stocks of ARCO and Unocal, both domestic refiners, were up by 7 percent apiece.
Fareed Mohamedi, senior economist at the Petroleum Finance Company, a Washington consulting firm, said the Saudis had accumulated at least 300,000 barrels of jet fuel for an air campaign projected to last three months against Iraq and gasoline supplies to keep tanks and other vehicles operating for a monthlong ground war.
Saudi orders pushed the profit margins for the big oil companies' refineries in Singapore above $20 for the equivalent of a barrel of gasoline, jet fuel or other petroleum products, compared with margins of about $2 a barrel before the gulf crisis erupted last August. At that time, Kuwait supplied about 4 percent of the world's refined crude products.
Michael Mayer, an analyst at Wertheim Schroder & Company, in San Francisco, said some refining and marketing units posted staggering profit margins in Europe, Japan and the Middle East and could set records for operating income in those sectors for Exxon, Mobil and Texaco.
In his view, Exxon's profits from all global operations will rise 44 percent, to $1.40 a share, from 97 cents in last year's first quarter. Mobil's operating income will jump by 63 percent, to $1.63 from $1.01, and Texaco's by 35 percent, to $1.55 from $1.15, he said.
George F. Friesen, an analyst at the Deutsche Bank Group, was even more bullish on Exxon and Mobil, putting Exxon's increase at 55 percent, and Mobil's at 68 percent. Exxon sold far more refined products in Europe than in the United States last year. Combined sales in Europe and Asia provided 55 percent of its total revenues.
Mobil, with several refineries in France, Germany, the Britain, Singapore, Japan and Australia, also sells more fuels in Europe and Asia than in the United States. Mr. Friesen projected that the profits of two other big suppliers for Europe and Asia, Royal Dutch/Shell and British Petroleum, would rise by 54 percent and 50 percent, respectively.
"The higher profits had to be expected," said Philip K. Verleger Jr., an energy specialist at the Institute for International Economics, in Washington. "It's just the ordinary functioning of the market. It's not profiteering."
The profit profile for companies that market mainly in North America is not so buoyant. Frederick P. Leuffer, senior oil analyst at C. J. Lawrence Inc., in New York, said ARCO's operating earnings for the first quarter would fall 31 percent. Gasoline price wars on the West Coast, where ARCO leads others in market share, have been hurting its refining profits. In addition, ARCO is feeling the pinch of declining natural gas prices, which are about 20 percent lower than a year ago.
Profits from operations at Amerada Hess will be off by 38 percent, and by 9 percent at Pennzoil and 6 percent at Unocal, Mr. Leuffer said.
Chevron and Amoco should post modest increases, Mr. Leuffer and other analysts say. These companies are large oil producers abroad, but they are not as active there in refining and marketing. Their profit growth was also restrained in the quarter because they are large natural-gas producers.

HEADLINE: COMPANY EARNINGS;
Digital Gains More Than Fourfold

BYLINE: By EBEN SHAPIRO

 BODY:
The Digital Equipment Corporation said yesterday that its quarterly profits had increased more than fourfold, and the shares of the nation's No. 2 computer maker jumped $4, or 6 percent, to $70.375, on the New York Stock Exchange. It was the third-most-active Big Board stock, with 2.3 million shares changing hands.
The earnings were slightly below Wall Street's expectations, but Digital's stock rose as high as $74.25 in early trading, apparently because investors were pleased by the progress the company had made in restructuring its business and cutting costs. During the quarter, more than 2,200 people left the company, through layoffs and attrition, out of a work force of about 120,000. 
 After I.B.M. posted a large loss last week, investors were nervous that other large computer makers would report disappointing results. "People were braced for a very bad quarter for Digital," said Richard Chu, an analyst with Cowen & Company in Boston. "The worst simply did not materialize."
Digital, based in Maynard, Mass., said it earned $116.6 million, or 94 cents a share, in its third quarter, compared with $24.9 million, or 20 cents a share, in the period a year ago. Last year's results included a $150 million restructuring charge.
 
Revenues Advance by 8%
 Revenues for the quarter were $3.52 billion, up 8 percent from $3.26 billion last year.
The quarter's results were reduced by the effects of the consolidation of Digital-Kienzle, a Germany company in which Digital recently acquired a 65 percent stake from Mannesmann A.G. for $230 million. Digital said that without the consolidation, earnings would have been $1.14 a share. Digital also paid $62.7 million in income taxes for the quarter. Last year, the company paid no taxes in the quarter.
Still, the makers of large computers will continue to be affected by the sluggish economy. "The difficult economic environment of the past several quarters is still with us," said John F. Smith, Digital's senior vice president for operations. He said customers were delaying investments in technology, particularly in large systems.
The company said its work station business doubled in the last year, while the weak economy hurt orders for its larger VAX 9000 computers.
The company has shipped about 250 systems so far, a number far below analysts' expectations.
While analysts question how successful the line of computers will be, Digital said orders for its high-end machines would improve along with the economy. Mr. Chu, the analyst, said, "You will find a large degree of skepticism on that point."
Mr. Chu said the most positive feature of the quarter was that Digital's revenue growth outstripped growth in expenses for the first time in memory.
"While there are significant questions about the demand outlook, they are at least on top of the cost curve, which has not been the case until recently," he said.

HEADLINE: Caught in Crossfire: Rising Toll in Streets

BYLINE: By GEORGE JAMES

 BODY:
For a teen-ager in the Bronx Wednesday night, death came as he helped his mother move out of a neighborhood she feared. For a 34-year-old woman in Brooklyn a night earlier, it came during a trip to the neighborhood bodega.
What linked them was that they were hit by bullets meant for others. They are among seven bystanders caught in the crossfire of gunfights since Tuesday afternoon. Two died; five were wounded. Five children were among them. 
 The city's Police Commissioner, Lee P. Brown, said yesterday that there was no explanation for the string of such shootings. But the effect on the public's perception of danger could be profound, as it was last summer, when public pressure after similar shootings led Mayor David N. Dinkins and Mr. Brown to promise to put thousands more police officers on the streets.
The pressure from the recent violence was already being felt yesterday at City Hall, where Dinkins administration officials said they would announce plans today for summer youth programs aimed at stemming violence. The announcement was pushed up a month after the shootings.
Mr. Brown said the underlying causes for the shootings were simple: drug turf wars, the proliferation of guns on the streets and the eroding moral values of young people who choose to carry the weapons.
"Some young people's perception about the worth of human life is not what it used to be," the Commissioner said. "We're dealing with morality and values that have degenerated over a period of time. Taking a life doesn't mean to some young people what it meant to me when I grew up."
The shootings took place on streets like many in the city where law-abiding people struggle to live amid the danger of the drug trade. The victims were ordinary people trapped by economic circumstances in terrifying conditions.
Ralphie Roopchand, 15, a student who liked Nintendo and wanted to be an accountant, was fatally shot in the neck and side on Wednesday as he loaded his mother's bedframe on a van in the Tremont section. Maribel Nieves, who had two children and worked as a home attendant, was shot in the head and killed the day before on her way to a bodega called Lucky's in Brownsville.
P'are Sharpe, 14, who liked dancing and wanted to be a lawyer, was wounded in the right leg in the same shooting that killed Ms. Nieves. As he lay in bed on Wednesday watching "Fantasy Island" on television with friends, his mother, Johnnie Mae Sharpe, 42, who had taken the day off from the security company where she works to take care of him, spoke of the anxiety of living in neighborhoods where drugs and guns are plentiful.
 
'Always Worried'
 "I'm always worried -- I'm always worried," said Mrs. Sharpe, a single parent who has another son in high school. "I work 10 hours a day. When I get up in the morning, I have to leave before my kids do. All I can do is say a prayer, that's about it. Because you never know if you're going to come back alive, and you come home and they're going to be alive."
"You'll be in your house and people will be shooting through your damn window," she said. "You stick your head out your window, somebody blows your brains out."
The other victims were a Brooklyn girl, 7, grazed by a bullet fired through her bedroom window Wednesday night; a Bronx woman, 20, who was eight months pregnant and was critically wounded when she walked into a drug shootout that left two women dead early Wednesday, and two Brooklyn girls shot Tuesday night -- one, 11, shot in the chest in Carnarsie, and one, 13, shot in the arm while walking home from school in Fort Greene.
Dr. Lawrence Sherman, a professor of criminology at the University of Maryland who has studied shootings in which bystanders were hit, said most of those struck were victims by nature of where they lived, rather than what they do or who they associated with.
 
Wrong Place at Wrong Time
 "The great myth about ghetto poverty is that most of the people who live in them are criminals or are lazy," he said. "Most of them just happen to be at the wrong place at the wrong time. They are just trying to maintain a normal life in Beirut-like conditions."
Life looked promising for Ms. Nieves, who had recently got a full-time job as a home attendant. She had been taking care of an ill woman only on weekends, so the new job meant she was working seven days a week.
At 8:45 P.M. on Tuesday, she was between her apartment at 375 Sumpter Street and Lucky's Mini-Market around the corner on Rockaway Avenue, where she was going to chat with a friend who worked there.
Suddenly, two men at the corner sprayed the street with 29 rounds from two 9-millimeter semiautomatic pistols. They were aiming at a man they had fought with over who would be allowed to sell drugs at a house on Sumpter Street, the police said. The bullets missed the intended target, but one struck Ms. Nieves in the head, killing her instantly.
 
Collapsed Near House
 P'are Sharpe said he was coming out of Lucky's when the intended victim ran by. He ran too, he said, and felt the "shock" of a bullet passing through his right calf. He passed Ms. Nieves's body and finally collapsed near her house.
The police arrested Torres Benedict, 20, of 2904 Atlantic Avenue, and said they were seeking another man.
Ms. Nieves's daughter, Ilia, 15, a student at Maxwell Vocational High School, was doing her homework when she heard the shots. She looked out the window and saw P'are on the ground. Her sister, Kaira, 11, a student at Public School 73, was watching television. Ms. Nieves's mother, Ida, who was watching the children, ran out of the house and found her daughter dead.
At the bodega, Ms. Nieves's friend, Anna Jaquez, 41, said: "She was happy because she had two jobs. She said she was going to buy a new bathroom set. A shower curtain, you know."
On the sidewalk yesterday where Ms. Nieves died, near the iron gate of a burned-out crack house and across from her youngest daughter's school, someone had written in paint that was still wet: "4-16-91 / R.I.P. Green eyes."
At 8:20 P.M. on Wednesday, Ralphie Roopchand, a student at Junior High School 22 who wanted to study accounting, had just loaded his mother's bedframe on a van that was double-parked outside her apartment at 274 West 173d Street. Afraid of the neighborhood, she was moving to Queens.
A man quickly appeared, spun the boy around and held him while another man shot him in the neck and side. One of his uncles, Suresh Laloo, 26, heard the shots and came running. "I saw him on the ground," Mr. Laloo said. "I lifted him up. He was trying to breathe, so I tried to give him mouth to mouth. I said, 'Ralphie, don't die on me.' "
 
Argument Over Debt
 Detectives said the teen-ager's death was a case of mistaken identity. The gunman thought the youth was a member of a group they had fought with after an argument over a debt owed for fixing someone's car, the police said.
"It's senseless," said Frederick Ragoonan, 29, another uncle of the boy. "He didn't have a chance to understand why he was being killed."
Mr. Ragoonan, a shipping clerk, recalled how the teen-ager had protected Mr. Ragoonan's three young children. They regarded the youth as a big brother, Mr. Ragoonan said.
"This makes no sense at all; these guys just wanted to kill somebody," his uncle said. "All these people walking around with guns."

Johnnie Mae Sharpe adjusted the bandage on the leg of her son, P'are, who was shot in the Brownsville section of Brooklyn by the same gunmen who had killed a woman by mistake moments earlier. Visiting him were friends, Najah Philpot, left, and Ike Gonzalez. (Steve Berman for The New York Times)

HEADLINE: Cuomo Vows All-Out Bid to Avoid Fiscal Takeover of New York City

BYLINE: By JOSH BARBANEL

 BODY:
Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, with Mayor David N. Dinkins at his side, vowed yesterday that he would do whatever was needed to keep the Dinkins administration from losing control of New York City's budget and finances to the state.
The Governor and the Mayor refused to provide any but the sketchiest details of how they planned to prevent the intervention of the state Financial Control Board, which under law and bond covenant could take over city finances if Mr. Dinkins cannot bring a gap of several hundred million dollars in the current budget down to $100 million.
 
Might Speed Payments
 Mr. Cuomo suggested that the state might speed up some aid payments, and city officials said they hoped yesterday's public show of support from the Governor would clear the way for them to negotiate concessions from municipal unions. 
 The statements from Mr. Cuomo and Mr. Dinkins marked a sharp turn in the political landscape of the city's fiscal affairs, with the Governor committing himself publicly to do what was necessary to prevent a state takeover. Some of his advisers have been arguing the merits of such action.
The Governor's interventon could buy Mr. Dinkins time to tackle the problems in the city's current fiscal year, which ends on June 30. But it still leaves him with a $3 billion hole in next year's budget.
He has been stymied in efforts to close it through concessions from unions, and will have to raise new taxes from the City Council and the Legislature and make cuts from his own agencies.
Any help the state offers the city would probably require approval from the State Legislature or City Council.
Striking a tone quite different from earlier this week -- when he said in an interview in Newsday that he was not sure he could prevent a takeover of the city's troubled finances -- Mr. Cuomo declared:
"What is needed, and I speak now as the Governor, is the cooperation of everyone involved. What is not needed is control by the state. As the chairman of the Financial Control Board, I wish to make clear that I believe the City of New York should have from the state not control, but cooperation."
Mr. Cuomo's stance earlier in the week had contributed to a slide in city bonds as investors worried that the Governor would try to prevent a takeover by raising the $100 million trigger, rather than by really closing the gap.
Mr. Cuomo said that with cooperation from Albany, it was "the unanimous view of the legislative leaders and of the Governor that the city is perfectly capable of managing the situation by itself."
After a two-and-a-half hour meeting in Mr. Cuomo's New York City office, the Governor and the Mayor agreed to set aside some smoldering antagonism and said their goal was to work together.
 
'We Are Confident'
 "We are confident, the Governor and I, that we are going to be able to meet our problems of fiscal year 1991, and there is no concern that a control board will take over and govern our city," Mayor Dinkins said in a news conference at Mr. Cuomo's office in the World Trade Center.
Despite their obvious pains to show cooperation, it was far from clear that the Mayor and Governor had settled the many differences between them.
The Mayor's top aides, after meeting continuously among themselves, with the Governor's aides and with city union leaders, slouched glumly in chairs flanking the podium as the Mayor spoke.
Governor Cuomo added, "We have ample time between now and the end of the year to plug that hole."
The leaders noted that the city would be required to disclose its plan to close its budget gap in an official offering statement being prepared in conection with a $1 billion note sale planned later this month in order to make up for state aid postponed because of a delay in the adoption of a state budget.
Mr. Cuomo said the city's problems were "simple" but later explained that this did not mean the solution would be easy. "It's not complicated," Mr. Cuomo said. "We're short of money and we have to find money."
The Mayor and the Governor said they did not want to disclose details of their discussions because they might be embarrassed if some of the ideas turned out to be unworkable, like the Governor's suggestion that the control board rules be changed, and because the details would be the subject of arduous negotiations.
It became clear during their statments and in later interviews that the Governor and Mayor were still looking for one-time payments, like the proceeds from a bond refinancing by the Municipal Assistance Corporation. But at least one new idea emerged.
Mr. Cuomo suggested that the state could speed up state aid now scheduled to be paid to the city next year, and pay it this year instead. Under city accounting rules, the city could count the aid in its current budget, even if the cash was not delivered until next year.
Some $70 million could be moved through this mechanism, one official familiar with the talks said.
 
Stumbling Block
 The city could also be helped by winning $60 million in wage concessions, ending unnecessary spending and using $110 million in reserve funds, the official said.
Asked later in a radio interview in Albany whether the state was prepared to send money to the city, Mr. Cuomo said, "As part of the discussion today we found an opportunity for some millions of dollars."
City officials said they welcomed the state advance, if it was acceptable under the city's accounting rules and did not make the city's problems next year worse.
The $70 million advance would exactly make up for state aid cut this city fiscal year.
It was not clear whether an important stumbling block betwen the Mayor and the Governor had been removed by yesterday's talks.
 
No Conditions
 Mr. Cuomo had steadfastly refused to help the city, city officials said, unless the city first wrested concessions from its work force. The Governor has frequently complained that the Mayor gave city workers a raise this year while the state could not afford to do so. The state had planned to lay off 10 percent of its work force.
Asked if there were conditions on any help the Governor might give, the Mayor said no.
"Whatever contribution labor makes is not necessarily linked to what else occurs," Mr. Dinkins said.
The Governor suggested there were no conditions, but reiterated that all parties would have to cooperate, and suggested once again that he could not help city union workers at the expense of state ones.
City officials said they hoped this would be enough to get stalled talks with municipal labor leaders moving. The city is seeking a three-day furlough of city workers and deferrals of raises.
 
'Making Progress'
 Barry Feinstein, the president of Local 237 of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, who angrily denounced the Governor earlier this week and ruled out furloughs, said yesterday that the city and unions were now "making progress."
"But that doesn't mean we are agreeing to any givebacks," he added.
If the Mayor is able to reach agreements with the Governor and the unions, and tax collections do not fall dramatically, the city could squeak through the current fiscal year.
But an agreement would only buy time and not much of it. The city is facing a budget gap that already totals more than $3 billion next year and is likely to get worse as the result of a continuing decline in the economy. Within weeks Mr. Dinkins must present a plan showing how he will balance that budget.
Both Mr. Cuomo and Mr. Dinkins said the Mayor had not made any commitments to support the Governor in his impasse with the Assembly and the Senate over the adoption of a state budget.

HEADLINE: BUSH SCHOOL PLAN WOULD ENCOURAGE CHOICE BY PARENTS

BYLINE: By SUSAN CHIRA, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 18

 BODY:
President Bush today began his campaign for improving American education, calling not only for national tests and a new kind of school, but also for a redirection of Federal money to help disadvantaged students who choose to go to private and parochial schools.
While President Bush has long backed the idea that parents should be able to choose the school their children attend, the plan unveiled today would commit both the Federal Government's money and moral suasion to the idea that parents should be able to use state and local tax dollars to pay for public, private or parochial schools.
 
'Death Sentence,' Senator Says
 Describing his 34-page plan to a White House audience of educators, business leaders, governors and members of Congress, the President said, "To those who want to see real improvement in American education, I say: There will be no renaissance without revolution." 
 Congressional concerns about already struggling public schools and about the need to maintain the separation of church and state required by the First Amendment pose large obstacles for the Administration proposal.
An early warning shot came today from Senator Edward M. Kennedy, the Massachusetts Democrat who is chairman of the Senate Committee on Labor and Human Resources. The panel would have to approve any revisions in the laws governing Federal support for education.
"The important idea of educational choice should not become a death sentence for public schools struggling to serve disadvantaged students," Mr. Kennedy said.
 
Encouragement for States
 Education Secretary Lamar Alexander said the President would encourage states and local districts to change their rules so that parents could apply their state and local tax dollars to send their children to either public or private schools. In turn, he said, he will propose that Congress change laws that limit the amount of Federal aid that goes to children in private and parochial schools.
Chapter I, formally known as Title I of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, is one of the largest sources of Federal money for education, financed at about $6 billion this fiscal year. Under it, a school receives money if a large proportion of its students qualify as needy. The money must be spent on remedial classes and services for those children, unless a school's poverty rate exceeds 75 percent, in which case Chapter I money can be spent on schoolwide programs.
Mr. Alexander said the Administration wanted to change the law so that, in districts that have choice programs, the money could in effect follow individual disadvantaged students wherever they choose to go to school.
The package of proposals unveiled today offers the clearest statement on how Mr. Bush proposes to make good on his campaign pledge to be the 'education President' and what steps he thinks Americans must take to lead the world in educational achievement. The President and the nation's governors set that target in six national educational goals he announced last year.
Mr. Bush has been widely criticized by Democrats as failing to deliver on his campaign promises about education, and they hope to make his record a major issue in the next Presidential and Congressional elections. The Administration proposals appear designed in part to blunt the Democratic strategy by demonstrating that Mr. Bush has not neglected education.
'For the sake of the future, of our children and our nation, we must transform America's schools," President Bush said. "The days of the status quo are over."
Mr. Bush spent most of his day promoting his new education plan. From 10 A.M. to well past 2:30 P.M., he met with governors, business leaders, lawmakers and educators. He was the host at an education lunch and delivered a national address from the East Room.
The plan relies more on the President's bully pulpit than the Government's purse. The measures would commit at least $690 million in new money for education, and a group of business leaders has pledged to raise at least $150 million to pay for research to invent a better American public school. But President Bush and Mr. Alexander said the publicity and leadership a President could provide was more important than money. "Dollar bills don't educate students," the President said.
 
National Tests and New Schools
 The plan calls for a broad range of measures involving not only the states but the nation's Governors, business leaders, and educators. Among the central points in the President's plan are these:
*Voluntary national tests, to be called American Achievement Tests, in mathematics, science, English, history and geography, so that students and schools can see whether they meet new national standards in these fields.
*Fund-raising by businesses, of at least $150 million, for design of 535 innovative new schools to serve as national models of excellence, and action by Congress providing grants to the communities that develop those schools.
*Rule changes by states and municipalities to let parents send children to any school they choose, in hopes that competition will force ailing schools to improve or face a student exodus.
*Lists of necessary skills to succeed in each industry, and national skill clinics so that workers can judge what new training they might need.
 
Dispute Over Choice
 The proposal to promote school choice will probably encounter the most opposition. Mr. Bush has long endorsed the idea that competition for students would spur schools to improve. Indeed, many schools hailed as among the best in the country, including some urban magnet schools and Deborah Meier's Central Park East schools in East Harlem, are public schools chosen by parents, students and teachers.
But by expanding the idea of choice to private and parochial schools, Mr. Bush would seek to undo the compromise that resulted in the first general Federal aid to education in 1965. He would reopen the debate by raising the possibility that public tax money would flow away from public schools to private and parochial schools, thus blurring the line between church and state. Some state choice programs, like one in Milwaukee, are already being challenged in the courts.
The Administration proposal marks the first time that the Federal Government has proposed supporting parental choice by redirecting a large block of Federal money. More than 90 percent of education aid comes from states and municipalities, so states and local governments remain the major players in any discussion of choice.
Whether or not Federal money can be permitted to flow to children in parochial schools under current law is not clear. In some cases, said Bruno Manno, acting Assistant Secretary of Education for Research and Improvement, parochial school students are receiving remedial tutoring paid for by Chapter I funds, but they receive it outside the physical plant of the parochial school.
 
Knowledge Standards
 Mr. Alexander defended the idea of choice as one that reflects deep American values. At a news briefing after the announcement, he said, "If they choose to go because that school serves them better, why shouldn't public money follow the child to this school?"
President Bush's plan also envisages other dramatic changes in American education. For the first time, the country would draw up national standards, defining what all American students should know in five subjects -- English, mathematics, science, geography and history. National tests geared to these standards would be offered in fourth, eighth and twelfth grades.
Mr. Bush also seeks to harness the outpouring of concern about America's educational ills from business leaders, who have complained for years that their workers cannot read, compute and think well enough to match workers from competing nations.
In the plan, a group of business leaders led by Paul H. O'Neill, the chief executive of Aluminum Company of America, have pledged to raise at least $150 million to finance several research and development teams to invent new kinds of American schools. These schools could stay open longer, use new technology or teaching methods or be organized differently from current schools. The only requirements would be that schools turn out students who meet the national educational goals and that the schools not cost more to operate than existing schools.
Mr. Bush calls for 535 such schools to be established by 1996. He will ask Congress to appropriate at least $1 million to establish each school. The schools will be selected by advisory panels after consultation with Mr. Alexander and the governor of each state.
 
'Too Little'
 Some educators and state officials questioned the wisdom of spending so much to develop new school models when several groups have innovative models in place.
"It's too little and it's in the wrong place," said Linda Darling-Hammond, an education professor at Columbia University and an expert on education reform.
Others disagreed. Theodore R. Sizer, a professor of education at Brown University who heads the Coalition of Essential Schools, an organization promoting more than 150 innovative public schools nationwide, supported the focus on research.
"The scale of our work isn't big enough," said Mr. Sizer, who said the coalition this year raised, with some difficulty, $5 million in donations. "It's not that we don't have a lot of experience with innovation, but we need a variety of efforts out there with enough funding."
Several business leaders reacted positively to the plan, although others said it may be difficult to raise the suggested money, given the recession and the fact that corporations already contribute about $225 million to $250 million to public schools.
Finally, the Bush plan also seeks to use Presidential leadership to convince Americans that educational excellence is important and that good students should be rewarded, not ridiculed. Mr. Bush would award citations to good students and good schools. To enlist the American public in the battle, Mr. Bush proposes creating 'America 2000 Communities' -- communities that draw up plans to improve local education.
To show the way, President Bush said that he, too, had decided to study something new: how to use a computer.
'I want to be computer-literate and I'm not," he said. 'I want to learn and I will. "

A Child's Innocence Fights Bias

BYLINE: By FRANK RICH

 BODY:
The wonderful thing about children is that they believe everything is possible. What makes Lynda Barry's first play a happy occasion is that she captures the innocent abandon of childhood with the wit of a mature writer but without letting go of the uninhibited child still lurking deep within herself.
Ms. Barry's uneven but highly promising comedy at the Second Stage, "The Good Times Are Killing Me," is about Edna Arkins, a pre-adolescent girl of the mid-1960's who believes, for the duration of elementary school anyway, that miracles like movie stardom and racial harmony are to be had for the asking, no matter what obstacles parents might place in the way. Ms. Barry, a syndicated cartoonist whose strip, "Ernie Pook's Comeek," appears in The Village Voice in New York, is just as free-spirited as her heroine in her first effort at writing for the stage. Like Edna, Ms. Barry at her best would rather hop, skip and jump than walk a straight dramatic line between any two points. She does not feel obliged to honor any dreary adult rules of the theater until her second act, at which time the play and Edna alike begin to settle into a conventional, lackluster maturity. 
 Until then, the evening has the rambunctious style if not the campiness of John Waters movies like "Hair spray" and "Cry- Baby" in which the rituals of growing up, the increased racial segregation of rock music and the accelerating civil rights movement all converge on the streets of a changing blue-collar urban neighborhood. Edna sets the tone right away by telling the audience that her once all-white block is in a state of traumatic demographical transition and that music is the center of her life. As her story progresses, sociological sea changes and intimate familial episodes are both defined by pop songs, whether the singers be Johnny Mathis, Paul Anka, James Brown, Elvis Presley or in one loopy interlude Julie Andrews in "The Sound of Music."
Mark Brokaw, the production's impressive young director, is in perfect tune with the playwright's jukebox approach to the traditional memory play. As Edna remarks that a song can make "the past rise up and stick in your brain," so old songs (and at times old "American Bandstand" or "Soul Train" dances) rise up in fragrant patches to accompany the script's remembered anecdotes about variously beloved and thorny relatives and neighbors. The writing and staging are both so fluid that "Good Times" sometimes seems to be touring the early chapters of its heroine's biography with the same ease with which one might pass in and out of distant radio stations while turning a dial. Upbeat episodes like Edna's budding friendship with a black girl next door, Bonna (Chandra Wilson), are as gracefully and economically revisited as such heartbreaks as a father's desertion or a child's accidental death. Life, by turns romantic and bitter, just keeps popping in and out of the doors that line the set's row-house facade.
As acted by Angela Goethals with a fetching precocity that never turns bratty, Edna is a winning guide to her wonder years. Her observations about teen-agers and adults are funny, especially when they are fleshed out by such pungent actors as Ruth Williamson (as a perpetually put-upon aunt given to making "tiny little faces"), Jennie Moreau (as both a patronizing older cousin and a ruler-banging music teacher) and John Lathan (as the hippest black male on the block). Ms. Goethals is moving, too, when she and her sad-faced kid sister (Lauren Gaffney, another fine child actor) turn their house's basement into a "Record Player Nightclub" that, though conceived as a joyous imaginary refuge from their parents' marital travails, becomes a mausoleum for lost love.
While not as fully written, the story of the black family next door is just as well acted, particularly by Ms. Wilson, whose Bonna eventually becomes a feisty co-narrator of the play, and by Kim Staunton, whose portrayal of Bonna's mother grows from a buoyant young woman singing "I Could Write a Book" while doing household chores to a wizened specter of middle-aged disappointment. Even when the writing lacks fine detail, one still feels Ms. Barry's kinship with black characters whose deferred dreams are touched by but not really redeemed by such revolutionary phenomena as "A Raisin in the Sun," "To Kill a Mockingbird" and the Black Panthers.
"Good Times" begins to dwindle when the author takes the issue of race relations head on rather than elliptically. Act II devolves into a diagrammatic tale of the gradual parting of Edna and Bonna during the seventh grade, and the girls' story all too heavily symbolizes the larger tale of racial separatism on the eve of the riots of the late 60's. Suddenly a previously free-form play leans on a contrived plot twist -- an exclusionary teen-age party -- and takes to making points didactically: Edna's uneasy participation in a black family ritual (a gospel church service) is laboriously contrasted with Bonna's participation in a quintessential white counterpart (a camping trip). It's almost as if the playwright, like the girls on stage, had abruptly decided she had to grow up and trim her wings. By the final half hour, her writing has become as formulaic and glib as the television specials on racial tolerance that the play has previously mocked.
Young audiences -- and this is a play sure to earn the respect and laughter of young audiences -- will not mind the faults of Act II too much, for the author never patronizes her young characters even when her storytelling becomes a bit numbing to those of parental age. While the failings of "The Good Times Are Killing Me" (its awkward title included) are real, they are those of breadth, not depth. Lynda Barry's engaging debut as a playwright is anything but cartoonish.

HEADLINE: The Bell Tolls for Rain Forests

BYLINE: By MALCOLM W. BROWNE

 BODY:
IT now takes less than 40 years for the human race to double, and there are few consequences of the population explosion more striking than the obliteration of the world's rain forests. The American Museum of Natural History has opened an exhibition dedicated to the natural treasure we are rapidly losing.
Most Americans are at least vaguely aware that the global appetite for beef, lumber and land is cutting into rain forests at an almost unbelievable rate. According to United Nations statistics, an area of rain forest five times the size of Manhattan is felled every day -- a rate that would eliminate all rain forests by the year 2081. 
 The new show, "Tropical Rain Forests: A Disappearing Treasure," running through June 2, was organized by the Smithsonian Institution Traveling Exhibitions Service in cooperation with the World Wildlife Fund. While the organizers of the exhibition deplore the destruction of rain forests, the displays are essentially tutorial and evenhanded. The points of view of various classes of people involved in the depletion of the Amazon rain forests are effectively presented by short recorded statements from a forest Indian, a jungle colonist, a rancher, a banker and a naturalist. A computer display asks the visitor to choose one of several strategies for saving rain forests, then responds by explaining the pitfalls of whatever choice is made.
Whatever justification various economic groups may find for cutting into the rain forests, their activities are costing the world's pool of animal and plant species dearly, as the exhibition underscores; lemurs, kinkajous, jaguars, Bengal tigers, various chameleons and many birds are among the tens or hundreds of thousands of species facing extinction because of their loss of habitat.
Diagrams, dioramas and photographs demonstrate how the damage can extend far beyond the dying rain forests themselves. Destruction of forests causes soil erosion and the silting of rivers and their deltas, for instance, and the silt is carried offshore and kills coral reefs, which are the habitats for many marine animals. The loss of rain-forest species may rob future scientists of clues to the design of new drugs with important therapeutic properties, the exhibition shows; among the pharmaceuticals that already owe their origins to natural products of the rain forests are heart medicines and tranquilizers.
Perhaps the most devastating long-term effect of loss of rain forests will be climatic. Rain-forest vegetation is a voracious consumer of atmospheric carbon dioxide, which is increasing at a troubling rate. Many scientists say most of the increase is a direct result of the population explosion and the increased burning of organic fuels (oil, coal, gas and wood). Carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas because it traps the energy of sunlight and heats the atmosphere.
If, as many scientists believe, this warming is inevitable, global agriculture could be radically affected, possibly precipitating mass famine. One of the few natural buffers easing the rapid increase of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is the global system of rain forests, which consume carbon dioxide to manufacture the carbohydrates of plant material.
But as the rain forests are killed off, this buffer is disappearing. Even if President Bush's "America the Beautiful" proposal for planting 10 billion trees in the next decade is successful, the effects of the destruction of the world's equatorial rain forests would be scarcely diminished.
 
The Intangible Loss
 One of the losses sometimes overlooked in discussions of the rain-forest problem is that of the beautiful mystery that haunted the world's artists in another era -- an aura that the museum exhibition suggests.
The "back to nature" artistic movement that flourished in England early in this century focused on tropical rain forests and inspired some of the most luminous literary description of the period. W. H. Hudson's romantic fantasy "Green Mansions" and Arthur Conan Doyle's "Lost World" were set partly under the cathedral-like arches of Amazon rain forests, and Joseph Conrad's evocative "Heart of Darkness" was based on the author's experiences with rain forests in the Congo.
Well into the 20th century a hint of somewhat sinister mystery pervaded the great rain forests; within living memory, headhunters roamed the Peruvian forests from which the Amazon springs, and even today vestiges of forest Indian culture survive in Brazil and elsewhere in South America. But in the face of bulldozers and chain saws, the culture and mystery are evaporating.
The museum show highlights some of the beauty that is dying out. A visitor entering the third-floor exhibition area passes a magnificent life-size model of the base of a gigantic buttressed fig tree, one of the principal anchors of rain-forest ecology. Hidden speakers broadcast the exotic sounds of forest birds, frogs and insects, and there are lush floral displays and representations of beautiful endangered animals.
There are also before and after photographs and dioramas of rain forests as they were in their pristine state, as they were during the few years cattle grazed where the trees were felled, and in their final state: empty, eroded deserts, virtually devoid of life and ruined by man for any useful function.
 
Where and When
 "Tropical Rain Forests: A Disappearing Treasure" will be on view at the American Museum of Natural History, Central Park West at 79th Street, through June 2. Sydney Horenstein, the museum's coordinator of environmental public programs, conducts special group tours of the exhibition for teachers and environmental associations; tours can be arranged by calling the museum at (212) 769-5726.
Eight short films on rain forests around the world run from 10:30 A.M. to 4:30 P.M. Sunday. Free with museum admission; suggested contribution, $5.

Outdoors on the Fifth Floor
One of the more serene outdoor cafes in town, high above the fumes and frenzy of Fifth Avenue, is the Terrace at Trump Tower, on the fifth floor of the building, between 56th and 57th Streets. The cafe was recently reopened by the owners of I Tre Merli and Barolo, both in SoHo, and La Focaccia in Greenwich Village. They also took over the DDL Foodshow on the main level of Trump Tower and renamed it I Tre Merli Bistro, serving salads and pastas.
 The Terrace's ivy-draped cafe has four tables with views down Fifth Avenue. The cafe offers a simple lunch menu of salads, grilled entrees and pastas. On a recent visit, a salad of julienned raw artichoke with lemon and Parmesan cheese had the consistency of straw but was refreshing and tasty ($7). An entree salad of watercress and tender grilled duck salad in a balsamic vinaigrette was pleasing ($12). Meat-filled ravioli in a tomato and basil sauce was satisfying, though not exceptional ($9.50). Desserts, however, are exceptional, particularly the creamy ricotta cheesecake and the raisin-apple bread pudding (both $6).
 
 The Terrace serves lunch only, 11:30 A.M. to 4 P.M. Monday to Saturday; closed Sunday. Major credit cards accepted. Telephone: (212) 319-5341.
 
$10 Lunch at Quatorze
 How far can restaurant downscaling go in this era of budget-consciousness? Quatorze, the handsome bistro at 240 West 14th Street in Manhattan, is offering a $10 prix fixe lunch.
 Don't expect fois gras and Sauternes. But the lunch I had recently was more than adequate. It started with a cup of sturdy minestrone, followed by a tartine (open-face sandwich) of chunky pork pate with brown bread and mustard. It also came with a small green salad.
Aside from the prix fixe menu, other economical lunch entrees include the omelet of the day ($8.50), and a salade nicoise ($10.95). I have to admit that after confirming that a $10 lunch can be pleasing, I splurged on the heavenly individual apple tart, one of my favorites here ($6.50).
While the $10 lunch is a welcome idea, Quatorze's regular lunch entrees are relatively pricey. They range from $16 for sauteed brook trout to $22 for grilled salmon.
 Quatorze is as comfortable and Parisian in feeling as it was when it opened in 1985, with beige-yellow walls holding mirrors and giant framed posters, and a marble-top bar.
Quatorze serves lunch noon to 3 P.M. Monday to Saturday; dinner 6 to 11:30 P.M. Monday to Saturday and 5:30 to 11 P.M. Sunday. American Express accepted. Telephone: (212) 206-7006.

BYLINE: By Bryan Miller

 BODY:
Gascony, the pastoral French province of foie gras, confit, game and Armagnac, is renowned for robust good eating. It's no wonder that the ancient Romans dubbed it the "granary of the Gauls."
 The lusty cooking of this region, based on goose and duck fat rather than butter or oil, hardly fits today's health-conscious dining habits. Yet several innovative chefs are integrating Gascon specialties into their menus in ways that do not have diners scurrying for cholesterol counts after dinner. At Gascogne in Chelsea, Pascal Coudouy, the chef and co-owner with his wife, Carol, is one who is doing an exemplary job.
 
 This 13-month-old venture is an enchanting and economy-minded spot -- no entrees exceed $20. It resembles a country farmhouse in France with its rough sandstone walls, partly exposed brick and walled-in outdoor garden. Mr. Coudouy worked at the Ambassador Grill during its tenure as a Gascon outpost; before that he worked in France under the esteemed Andre Daguin at the Hotel de France in Auch.
 If you want to start the meal in an authentic manner, begin with some duck foie gras, either sauteed with various fruit-based sauces, or in a velvety cold terrine flavored with Armagnac. Typical of the chef's leaner dishes is a winning combination of well-seasoned salmon and sliced potatoes with onions and sour cream. A big hit at my table were the rolls of thinly sliced prosciutto rolled around warm white beans with a gribiche sauce (capers, cornichons, hard-boiled eggs) with mixed greens around. The prosciutto did little, though, for baked oysters -- the oyster flavor was obscured. Better choices are the thick lentil soup with a succulent confit of duck wing in it, and a special of minced smoked duck breast in a ball of mild goat cheese, all encased in phyllo and served warm with mixed greens. A tasty little sampler plate includes slices of air-cured duck breast, smoked duck, confit of duck gizzards and confit of crispy chicken legs.
 Gascogne has a limited but interesting regional wine list. This is a good place to try some of the region's better offerings, like Cahors, Madiran, Buzet and Luberon. An exceptionally good buy is the light and fruity 1985 Cahors Haute-Serre ($24).
 Among main courses, an entree portion of duck leg confit comes with a ragout of peas, bacon and onions. One expects confit to be well salted, but this one was excessively so. Two recommended selections are a grilled baby chicken with shallots confit and a sauce of Madeira and rosemary; and juicy pink loin of lamb stuffed with mixed vegetables in tarragon-scented pan juices. Steak au poivre, a special, was tender, beefy and aggressively hot, garnished with crunchy deep-fried leeks. Another special, cod swathed with tapenade and mired in a thick sauce of peppers, onions and tomato, was not so appealing -- neither garnish had any distinction.
 Cassoulet weather may have passed, but if we get an unexpected cold snap and the dish returns as a special, the version here is worth trying: a succulent melding of duck confit, pork sausage, gizzards and beans. Breast of magret (from fatted ducks that are bred for the production of foie gras) is served garnished with grapes and Armagnac. The combination had plenty of flavor going for it, but the duck was served so rare, in the French style, that I could hardly chew it. Aficionados of rabbit will enjoy the version here, roasted and garnished with pancetta and sauteed cabbage.
 Desserts alone are worth a trip to this Chelsea outpost. A trio of prune selections includes airy prune pudding over a thick slice of bread, prunes in puff pastry, and ice cream with Armagnac-marinated prunes. The pear trio is equally good: pear Tatin, pear mousse in a tuile cookie, and pears poached in red wine. Creme brulee, too, is picture perfect. Only the Grand Marnier crepe was too sweet to handle.
 Bringing a little bit of Gascony to Eighth Avenue would be a challenge under any circumstances, more so during the difficult past year for restaurants. Carol and Pascal Coudouy deserve plaudits for their pluck, and patronage for their enticing food.

HEADLINE: The Dow: Less Than Meets the Eye

 BODY:
Wednesday's record close for the Dow Jones industrial stock average doesn't mean that the recession is coming to an end or that the banking crisis is solved. Indeed, the Dow average finished below 3,000 yesterday. The ups and downs on Wall Street matter to the 50 million Americans who own stock, but don't mean much of anything to the national economy.
Some observers say that the Dow closed above 3,000 for the first time ever because investors think the recession will soon be over, or because they expect the Federal Reserve Board to knock down interest rates or because they expect oil prices to fall. But whatever investors may have been thinking, they have no special insight and achieve no such consensus on economic trends. 
 Stock prices have soared because some investors believe other investors believe stock prices would rise -- so why not get in first? Such sentiments respond to surprise information, like unexpectedly high or low inflation figures, but more often reflect sheer guesswork. Stock market averages, as predictors of recession and recovery, tend to be wrong nearly as often as they are right.
This said, a rising stock market does make shareholders wealthier, spurring consumption. That's good news for department stores and travel bureaus. But it is easy to exaggerate the impact. In October 1987 the Dow plunged more than 500 points and the national economy barely sagged. Historians are far from sure that the 1929 stock market crash caused or much worsened the Depression.
The important point is that Wall Street wields only minor influence over Main Street. Whether the Dow rises or falls by 50 points, across America the same people work at the same jobs with the same equipment to churn out the same products.

HEADLINE: Dr. Axelrod's Courage

 BODY:
Dr. David Axelrod, forced by sudden illness to retire this week as New York State's Health Commissioner, was an extraordinarily principled chief health officer who will be difficult to replace.
In a job that all too often reflects the narrow interests of the medical profession and its institutions, Dr. Axelrod saw the state's whole population as his patient. He treated it with uncommon compassion, vision and courage. 
 His 12-year tenure included notable achievements. He pushed for measures now in effect to ban smoking in public places. He imposed rules establishing better supervision and working hours for hospital interns and residents, thus curtailing the hospitals' exploitation of the young doctors. He worked to protect the privacy of AIDS patients. And he confronted doctors on issues of malpractice.
Most important, he waged a vigorous campaign to make health care broadly available, and affordable. During the 1980's, persistent inflation of medical costs exhausted public budgets, even as festering social problems swelled the numbers of patients with no way to pay medical bills. Especially in New York, epidemics of drug abuse and AIDS put critical pressure on the health care system.
Facing such strains, Dr. Axelrod sought to force efficiencies on hospital administrators and physicians unused to skeptical oversight. And he insisted that austerity should not mean the sacrifice of health care for the poor.
Thus he argued last year against a major health care bill widely supported by the state's medical establishment; the commissioner felt it provided too much for big hospitals at the expense of neighborhood clinics and poor children.
And when he proposed a universal health insurance plan similar to one in Massachusetts, he added provisions to give Albany sweeping control over fees hospitals and doctors might charge. The proposal remains a proposal, but it stakes out a bold position for state regulators.
Such moves did not always endear Dr. Axelrod to the health care community; New York's Medical Society called for his dismissal in 1989. That did not reflect any failure so much as it did his stubborn sense of duty to all the state's citizens, not just its doctors.
In fact, few public servants demonstrate so much integrity in office for so long. Dr. Axelrod's departure is a stunning loss.

HEADLINE: Despite Recession, New York Remains World's Best Dining City

 BODY:
To the Editor:
In "The Day the Eating Stopped" (editorial, April 2), you suggest that the restaurant industry in New York is in real trouble, notably because people are bored by eating out, even embarrassed to be seen in good restaurants. As someone in the business of surveying New York City diners -- more than 5,500 this year -- I suggest you haven't been in many New York restaurants recently. 
 Despite the recession, many restaurants are bursting at the seams with patrons. Try visiting Aureole, Bouley, Cafe des Artistes, Carmine's, Coco Pazzo, Gotham Bar & Grill, Il Mulino, Jour et Nuit, Le Cirque, Le Comptoir, Le Madri, Les Halles, Mesa Grill, the Palm, Park Bistro, the River Cafe, Sparks or Union Square Cafe. You can add a host of lesser-known, inexpensive neighborhood pasta places and ethnic restaurants throughout the city.
Our surveys reflect that consumer interest continues to be high and that the New York restaurant industry has been outdoing itself to provide good, affordable dining in what most informed observers believe is the world's best dining city.

To the Editor:
I am the proprietor of Scoop, a moderate-priced, untrendy restaurant, at the same address in New York City for 32 years. Your April 2 editorial criticizes restaurants in general, rather than encouraging people to support the ones they enjoy. 
 No one should be made to feel guilty about enjoying a lunch or dinner in a restaurant with friends or family. Yes, the recession is hurting the business, but it is wrong to foster a negative attitude to an industry and the people in it, who work hard to make a living in a difficult economy.
Let's not have to add to the 7,000 people already out of jobs because of restaurant closings.

To the Editor:
I read "Recession and Guilt Pare Dining Trade and Menus" (front page, March 31), on the decline and fall of the restaurant business, with dismay. I believe it applies only to certain rarefied restaurants. 
 My partners and I own and run three restaurants on the Upper East Side. The Brighton Grill has been in business since 1984, Stephanie's opened in 1987 and Malabar in 1990. We have tried to serve good food, attractively prepared at reasonable prices. We have never tried to pander to the elaborate food fantasies of people for whom restaurants are an extension of their egos.
We love our restaurants, and we love our customers. To suggest that New Yorkers have quit patronizing all restaurants because of some customers and some greedy restaurateurs does the business and the city -- not to mention those who enjoy occasionally dining out -- a great disservice.

Weyerhaeuser Head Plans to Retire in July

BYLINE: By JONATHAN P. HICKS

 BODY:
George H. Weyerhaeuser, the chairman and chief executive of the Weyerhaeuser Company said yesterday at the company's annual meeting that he would retire when he turned 65 in July and that he would turn over the post to John W. Creighton Jr., the president. The move was expected.
Mr. Creighton will be the first chairman of the 91-year-old forest products company who is not a member of the founding Weyerhaeuser family. Mr. Creighton, who is 59 years old and has been with the company since 1970, was elected a corporate vice president that year. In 1985, he became executive vice president with specific duties in the real estate and financial services area. 
 Weyerhaeuser, based in Tacoma, Wash., has been criticized by analysts, who have long contended that the company has not worked sufficiently to improve its performance and to undertake an effective cost-cutting plan. The company also said that its earnings for the first quarter had plunged by 57 percent.
To cut costs and eliminate businesses outside of its forest products core, Weyerhaeuser has in the last two years divested $400 million in operations, including its hardwood plant in Chesapeake, Va., a beauty-aids center in St. Louis and a gypsum plant in Briar, Ark.
"We are now well into the second and more important phase of the company's refocusing program, implementing and tracking operating improvement plans for each business unit," Mr. Creighton said in a statement. "Momentum is building, despite the recessionary problem. Our financial condition was strong as we went into this recession, and we will be in the same strong financial condition coming out of it."
He added that Weyerhaeuser was evaluating whether to make further curtailments.
Daniel F. Nelson, a forest products analyst with Ragen, MacKenzie in Seattle, said Mr. Creighton would inherit critical challenges.
"He will have to bring life to a company that has underperformed for much of the last 10 years," he said. "The company historically has been overstaffed and has been run paternalistically, and some of the hard decisions have been side-stepped from time to time, such as how to sufficiently trim labor costs and operating costs."
Mr. Nelson added: "I don't think they have spared any expense in developing the yield on their forest lands. But getting a good economic return on that has been elusive."
Mr. Creighton holds bachelor's and law degrees from Ohio State University and an M.B.A. from the University of Miami. He is married and has three children.
Before coming to Weyerhaeuser, he worked with Mortgage Consultants for four years and with the Arvida Corporation from 1959 until 1966. Earlier, he spent two years with Arthur Andersen & Company.

How to Prepare for Loss of a Job

BYLINE: By Jan M. Rosen

 BODY:
With waves of layoffs and offers of early retirement rolling through corporate America, all employed people should be putting their finances in shipshape condition, experts counsel. They also offer advice for those already adrift.
"Build capacity," said George E. L. Barbee, who is in charge of personal financial services for Price Waterhouse and is based in Waltham, Mass. "Reduce consumer debt -- that's the first priority -- and create an emergency fund." 
 Historically an emergency fund of cash and cash equivalents like Treasury bills should have been equal to three to six months' income, he said, but now he is advising people to extend that by six to nine months. "Someone who is out of a job nine months to a year can easily burn up $50,000 to $75,000," he said.
Avery E. Neumark, a partner in Weber, Lipshie & Company in New York and the firm's director of employee benefits and executive compensation, said, "As a rule of thumb, figure it could take a month to find a job for each $10,000 of income -- a year for an executive earning $120,000."
Tamara G. Telesko, a lawyer and vice president at Chase Manhattan Bank, advised people to "do a really good cash flow, and look at your employee benefits and see how much it would cost to replace them" in planning for an emergency fund or for a future away from the company.
Ms. Telesko, who advises private banking customers in New York, said most people would need an accountant's advice on the tax impact to make an accurate projection in the benefits area, which could include life, health and disability insurance, child-care benefits and pension and retirement plans. The loss could be far greater for people not yet vested in pension plans.
She advises employees who are given incentive stock options to exercise them, then sell the stock and move into a diversified portfolio of other stocks and tax-exempt bonds. Too much of an employee's financial well-being is linked to the employer's health to compound the problem by having the bulk of one's assets in the company stock.
"Have a strategy in place, and don't be caught at the whim of the market," by holding a lot of unexercised options or a big block of stock in one company, she added. It is particularly important for those who are evaluating offers of early retirement or who are let go and given a severance package to consult an accountant about the tax planning involved in structuring those payments. Decisions must be made about whether to take a lump-sum payment, and if so, whether to use 5- or 10-year averaging, if eligible, or roll over pension money into an I.R.A. or whether to defer payments. The answers will depend on individual circumstances. Mr. Barbee is counseling people in the current recessionary environment to take a defensive financial stance that allows them "to become increasingly self-reliant."
People who have put together a good cash cushion should "spread it around among institutions," Mr. Barbee added, to protect themselves against assets being frozen in the event of an institution's insolvency, putting some in bank C.D.'s and some in money market funds. Consumers should choose top-rated banks and brokers, he said, rather than going for the last tenth of a percentage point they see advertised.
"People better not wait until they have lost a job to seek a home-equity line," he added. Arrange for such a line of credit while employed, but draw on it only in emergency, he said, using cash first.
Mr. Neumark advised people who are given notice to negotiate with their employers to continue their health insurance coverage as long as possible. Under Federal law dismissed employees are entitled to pay their own premiums and continue the group coverage generally for 18 months, he noted, but they would not begin paying until the employer quits paying.
Health insurance can cost $400 to $500 a month for a family under a group policy, he said, and may be more if it must be purchased privately.
People who have lost their jobs should draw up a realistic budget, Mr. Neumark said, that allows them to "live comfortably but not luxuriously," perhaps eating out less often or at less luxurious restaurants, or occasionally substituting a video for a movie, but not staying home altogether.
"If you are going to cut yourself down to the bone, it will affect you psychologically," he said. "The best way to get a new job is to remain visible and active -- don't go around with a bad attitude." Mr. Neumark had one final tip for those looking for a new job: "Get a roll of quarters -- you'll be making more calls from public telephones than you've ever made in your life."

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Rises as Confidence in U.S. Economy Grows

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar surged again on world currency markets yesterday as confidence grew that the economy was ready to climb out of recession.
Gold prices declined worldwide. On the New York Commodity Exchange, gold bullion for current delivery settled at $356.70 a troy ounce, down $1.20 from Thursday. The Republic National Bank said gold fell $1 an ounce, to $356.50. 
 The dollar began advancing earlier in the week. The gains were supported by indications that unemployment might be bottoming out and by the absence of any movement on interest rates by Germany's central bank or the Federal Reserve.
Many analysts had expected a Bundesbank rate increase in tandem with a Fed move to ease credit, a combination that could have hurt the dollar.
While there was virtually no fresh news to propel the dollar higher yesterday, traders said the general view of the American economy had improved significantly.
John Marchese, chief economist at the Pegasus Econometric Group in Hoboken, N.J., said perceived improvements in the economy had given foreign investors an incentive to buy dollars. "With the German economy having a bit of a problem," the dollar is the most likely alternative for investment, he said, adding that the dollar put in its best performance against the German mark and the British pound.
Andrew Hodge, a vice president at Bank Brussels Lambert, said the dollar went "up to the sky and broke" through several key barriers. "This is for real," he said, in contrast to recent technical moves.
In Tokyo, the dollar rose 1.63 yen, to a closing 137.90 yen. Later, in London, it was quoted at 138.40 yen. In New York the dollar settled at 138.35 yen, up from 137.80 yen on Thursday.
In London, the British pound sank to $1.7204 from $1.7715 late Thursday. In New York it cost $1.7205 to buy 1, less expensive than Thursday's $1.7520.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Thursday's rates, included: 1.7360 German marks, up from 1.7052; 1.4679 Swiss francs, up from 1.4570; 5.8575 French francs, up from 5.7615; 1,282.00 Italian lire, up from 1,262.00, and 1.1550 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1523.
Gold fell in London to a late bid price of $356.50 a troy ounce, from $358.50 late Thursday. In Zurich, the metal fell to a closing bid of $356.10 from $358.60. Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold fell $3.56 to close at $357.99 bid.

HEADLINE: Guam, Against the Tide, Wants Air Base Closed

BYLINE: By GWEN IFILL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 19

 BODY:
Like many in Congress, Ben Blaz of Guam is applying pressure on the Pentagon about the status of the military base in his district. But unlike his Congressional colleagues, Mr. Blaz wants the base in his district to close.
Mr. Blaz, a Republican and a former Marine Corps general who is a nonvoting delegate to Congress, has found himself struggling against the tide in his efforts to close the Agana Naval Air Station so that it can be used in the expansion of a commercial airport. But the Pentagon considers the base too valuable to military operations in the Pacific. 
 Last week, when Defense Secretary Dick Cheney said no bases would be closed if it were up to members of Congress, Mr. Blaz fumed.
 
'Not Reading My Mail'
 "I think to myself, 'Somebody's not reading my mail,' " said Mr. Blaz, who has appealed to no avail to Mr. Cheney and to H. Lawrence Garrett 3d, the Secretary of the Navy.
Mr. Blaz and Joseph F. Ada, the Governor of Guam, have asked the Defense Department to vacate the Agana naval air station and turn the property over to the local government at no cost. Guam officials would then be able to move forward with plans to use the 2,200-acre base to expand the neighboring Guam International Air Terminal, the island's major commercial airport.
Mr. Blaz said he had taken his request to James A. Courter, the chairman of the Defense Base Realignment and Closure Commission, which will make the final proposals this summer for Congressional consideration.
Mr. Courter said he considered Guam's request legitimate and worthy of further investigation. But he stopped short of guaranteeing a decision to include the Guam base on the final closure list.
 
Relocation of Base Urged
 Mr. Blaz would like the Navy to relocate Agana's operations to the larger Andersen Air Force Base on the northern tip of the island.
But a General Accounting Office study made public late last year found that the Navy would have to spend $229 million to move the installation. It was estimated that it would take more than 100 years for the savings from the consolidation to reach that level.
By contrast, Mr. Cheney's base-closing recommendations are expected to begin saving money by 1997. The Pentagon estimated the cost of closing the recommended bases at $5.7 billion over the five years it would take to close them. But it said the military would save $6.5 billion in operating costs over the same period.
Lieut. Dane LaJoie, a Navy spokesman, said the Agana base was not selected for closing because troops deployed in the western Pacific still rely on the airfield. "The Navy mission remains unchanged in Guam," Lieutenant LaJoie said.
 
Emotional Attachment Cited
 About one-third of the land on Guam, a self-governing United States territory, is controlled by the Federal Government. More than 22,000 military personnel and their dependents live on Guam, accounting for nearly one-fourth of the island's population.
Guam's repeated requests that the military abandon Agana are rooted in history, emotion and the territory's quest for the sort of international economic development that an improved airport could provide.
Mr. Blaz, who was forced as a 15-year-old to help clear the fields to build the airport for Japanese forces that occupied the island in World War II, said many Guam natives had an emotional attachment to the site. He said a memorial should be incorporated into the airport expansion on that site.
But the most compelling argument is the one that is rooted in dollars and cents. Expanding the commercial airport, officials say, will further strengthen the island's booming economy by increasing tourism and turning the airport into a hub for trans-Pacific flights.
 
Looking to Middle Ground
 Mr. Blaz said he would be willing to find a middle ground in which Guam would compensate the Navy for the cost of relocating the base. "We could modernize that base, get all of it or just part of it," he said. "But we can't even get to the table to discuss the things we could do."
Of the options proposed by Mr. Blaz, Lieutenant LaJoie said there had been no discussions with the Air Force about whether it would be possible to combine operations on Guam.
Mr. Blaz acknowledged that up to now going "hat in hand" to Congressional committees and Cabinet departments to try to persuade them to close the air station has yielded few results.
"The problem with a little fry like me is, there are not too many listeners," he said.

HEADLINE: $32 Million Loss for Quarter Is Reported by Caterpillar

BYLINE: By JONATHAN P. HICKS

 BODY:
Caterpillar Inc., the giant bulldozer and excavating equipment maker, yesterday reported a $32 million loss in the first quarter, attributing the results to weakened demand brought about by the recession.
The loss compared with net earnings of $99 million, or 97 cents a share, in the first quarter of last year. The company's revenues dropped 9.8 percent, to $2.59 billion from $2.87 billion. 
 The company, which is based in Peoria, Ill., said sales of its equipment abroad had weakened by about 1 percent in the quarter. But Caterpillar reported a particularly strong decline within the United States, where sales dropped 20 percent.
 
 $21 Million Write-Off
 The results included a previously announced $21 million pretax charge in relation to the consolidation of the North American operations of its building construction products division. Under that consolidation, a plant in Ontario is to be closed later this year and some of its 380 workers laid off. The operations are to be relocated to a plant in North Carolina.
The company announced in February that it might report a loss because of the economic downturn.
"During this difficult time, we are taking appropriate measures to reduce costs while implementing our reorganization into profit centers and, at the same time, carrying out our factory modernization," Donald V. Fites, the chairman, said yesterday in a statement.
 
 Construction Activity Depressed

Caterpillar said domestic sales were hurt by depressed construction activity that caused steep declines in machine sales. Lower commodity prices also contributed to the sharp declines in demand for machines used to haul everything from forest products and gravel to agricultural products. In addition, the company said, lower demand for truck engines hurt sales of diesel engines.
Although volume fell in sales to foreign customers, that factor was offset by higher prices and the strength of European currencies. But high interest rates and weakening economies "caused dealer machine sales to decline sharply in most industrialized countries," the company said.
On the New York Stock Exchange, Caterpillar's share price fell $1 yesterday, closing at $49.50.

HEADLINE: FUTURES/OPTIONS;
Corn and Soybeans Climb; Soviets Seek Export Credits

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Corn and soybean futures prices surged yesterday on the Chicago Board of Trade amid expectations that the Bush Administration will grant new export credit guarantees to the Soviet Union. Other grain futures also finished higher.
The Agriculture Department disclosed early yesterday that the Soviet Union was seeking $1.5 billion in export credits to buy food, confirming rumors and reports that had circulated in the markets all week. 
 The Soviets have nearly exhausted $1 billion in American export credits granted in January.
Traders expect the Adminstration to offer at least $500 million in export credits, at least some of which the Soviets are expected to use to buy corn and soybean meal for livestock feed, said William Biedermann, research director at Allendale Inc., a commodities brokerage firm. "Their poultry industry is in dire shape," he added. "They need two million to three million metric tons of corn immediately."
United States and Soviet officials are meeting this weekend in Washington to discuss Moscow's request.
Analysts said the price action also reflected a longer-term view that the the Soviets will need much more food aid in the future if their economic situation continues to deteriorate.
Corn futures settled 2 cents to 3 1/4 cents higher, with the contract for delivery in May at $2.56 3/4 a bushel; soybeans were 8 1/4 cents to 10 cents higher, with May at $5.90 1/4 a bushel; wheat futures were 1 cent to 2 cents higher, with May at $2.78 3/4 a bushel; oats were 1 cent to 1 1/4 cents higher, with May at $1.23 a bushel.
Cattle futures settled mostly lower and pork futures ended narrowly mixed ahead of a quarterly Agriculture Department cattle-on-feed report that confirmed perceptions that the beef cattle supply was expanding.
The Agriculture Department said there were 10.9 million head of cattle on feedlots in the 13 largest cattle-producing states on April 1, which was 8 percent more than a year ago and the largest herd size for that date since 1973.
The market had expected a slightly larger increase, so analysts said the report could prompt some buying of cattle futures on Monday.
Live cattle were unchanged to 0.20 cent lower, with April at 79.90 cents a pound; feeder cattle were 0.05 cent to 0.30 cent lower, with April at 89.97 cents a pound; live hogs were 0.05 cent lower to 0.57 cent higher, with April at 52.42 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were 0.47 cent lower to 0.20 cent higher, with May at 61.27 cents a pound.

HEADLINE: Religion Notes

BYLINE: By Ari L. Goldman

 BODY:

 
 
Faithful to God and I.R.S.
 It is hard to say whether a finding like this will make people run to church or run the other way, but a new survey shows that the more that people attend church, the less likely they are to cheat on their income taxes. 
 The study found that among those who go to church at least once a week, only 7 percent are inclined to cheat at tax time. The number goes up to 15 percent among those who attend one to three times a month and doubles again, to 30 percent, for those who do not go to church at all.
The results are published in the current issue of The Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion and are based on personal interviews with 316 adults in Oklahoma City in 1989 by researchers at the University of Oklahoma.
The survey also found a strong link between religious affiliation and cheating on taxes. Of those who identify with a denomination, only 15 percent said that they were inclined to cheat. The number was nearly 50 percent among those who were unaffiliated.
While the article does not argue that the Oklahoma survey reflects attitudes in the nation as a whole, one of the authors, John Cochran, said that "one can safely generalize" that the results would be the same throughout the Bible Belt region.
 
 Interfaith Harmony
 Trying to patch up their discord over the Persian Gulf war, liberal Protestants and Reform Jews have issued a joint statement on the conflict that acknowledges differences but finds much common ground.
In the weeks before the war began, liberal Protestant leaders, speaking through the National Council of Churches, condemned any use of military force in the gulf, while the Reform congregational organization declared use of military force against Iraq "an acceptable moral option."
The joint statement, issued this week and signed by officials of the National Council of Churches and the Union of American Hebrew Congregations, said, "We are relieved that the armed conflict in the gulf region has ended, but we must state categorically that there is little cause for jubilation."
Thousands of civilians have died, the statement said, "thousands have been made homeless, and property has been destroyed not only in Kuwait and Iraq but also in Israel, Saudi Arabia and Bahrain. Enormous economic dislocation has taken place. Damage to the environment will take years to heal."
The statement also calls on Arabs and Jews to seize the opportunity for peace in the Middle East. But it acknowledges differences between the Jewish and Christian groups on whether the Palestine Liberation Organization should be permitted to negotiate on behalf of the Palestinians.
Finally, the statement calls on the United States Government in the aftermath of the war to work "with equal determination and will" to eliminate American homelessness, poverty, hunger and lack of adequate health care.
The statement calls on all Christians and Jews to "join hands" and "work to make this world into the world that God commanded it could and should be."
 
 Intrafaith Cacophony
 While the joint Christian-Jewish statement achieved an interfaith high note, the reaction to the gulf war left two Jewish groups at each other's throats.
Rabbi Alexander Schindler, president of the Reform group and a signer of the interfaith statement, sharply criticized a postwar declaration by the head of the Lubavitch Hasidic movement, Rabbi Menachem M. Schneerson.
The Hasidic rabbi's statement, published last month as a full-page advertisement in The New York Times and other newspapers, hailed the allied victory, with "casualties amazingly few," as "miraculous."
In his response, the Reform rabbi said the statement was "a stain on the Jewish soul." Acknowledging that he had taken a public stand in support of the war, Rabbi Schindler added that "my joy is muted" by the thousands of Iraqi dead and wounded. "Are they not God's children, too?" he asked.
Responding to the remarks, Rabbi Manis Friedman, the dean of a Lubavitch school in St. Paul, said Rabbi Schneerson had also expressed compassion for the victims of the war but believed that they too were part of God's plan.
"The thing I don't understand," Rabbi Friedman continued, "is what Schindler does with the entire Bible, with the 10 plagues. When the righteous are victorious over evil, there is something to celebrate, unless Schindler believes there is no evil. In which case, why did he support the war?"

HEADLINE: Holtzman Sees Big Job Loss From Tax Effort by Dinkins

BYLINE: By FELICIA R. LEE

 BODY:
New York City Comptroller Elizabeth Holtzman warned yesterday that tax increases proposed or adopted by the Dinkins administration could mean the loss of 265,000 jobs in the city and delay recovery from the deep recession.
A study released by economists in Ms. Holtzman's office said the combination of a $822 million tax increase in fiscal year 1991 and the $1.2 billion increase proposed for the next fiscal year would catch up with the city by 1994. Each $100 million increase in the local tax burden could lead to a loss of as many as 10,800 jobs, the study said. 
 The study did not analyze the consequences of not raising taxes and instead making the service reductions that the gap in revenues might necessitate. Such cutbacks, the study said, might well contribute to further job loss and the continuation of the recession.
Ms. Holtzman said she would not take a position on whether the city should raise taxes and neither did the study. She said that while the study did not assess or analyze alternatives, she hoped it would be the beginning of a more informed dialogue about the impact of the city's fiscal policies.
The administration is struggling to reduce a $465 million budget gap for the fiscal year ending June 30.
The City Council has opposed the amount of the proposed tax increase. Peg Breen, the spokeswoman for the Council, said yesterday: "We're glad the Comptroller agrees with us about the size of the Mayor's tax proposal. That's why we've recommended virtually cutting his tax proposals in half."
Sally Hernandez-Pinero, Deputy Mayor for Finance and Economic Development, called the study simplistic and the numbers inflated. "The question is, how much of the job loss is through tax increases and how much is the economic environment?" she said.
Commissioner of Finance Carol O'Cleirecain criticized the study as a "crude piece of work" that raised more questions than it answers.
"This is a complicated issue," she said. "What is the mechanism of disincentive here? Where are the job losses supposed to be? If it cannot be used to oppose a local tax increase then what can it be used for?"

HEADLINE: AFTER THE WAR;
U.S. Is Prepared to Aid Kurdish Refugees in Iran

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 19

 BODY:
The United States is prepared to make a substantial contribution to the effort to help feed and shelter Kurdish refugees fleeing from Iraq to Iran, Administration officials said today.
Discussions between Washington and Teheran, conducted through Swiss intermediaries, have advanced in recent days from cautious feelers to a formal request from Iran for American assistance and an American response asking for a breakdown of aid that is needed. 
 State Department officials said the White House was prepared to move ahead when Iran responds, probably working through the Iranian Red Crescent Society, a private humanitarian organization that is Iran's equivalent of the Red Cross. They stressed that such discussions did not signify an improvement in relations, but that they could conceivably strengthen the hand of moderates in Teheran who are urging openings to the West.
"There is no decision on how far we will go," a State Department official said. "But we are in a responsive mode."
 
'We Need a Specific List'
 It is not clear whether Iran will seek relief supplies or financial assistance. Officials said it was too early to say how much the United States would be asked to donate, but they suggested that the scale of the aid would be far smaller than efforts to help refugees who have fled to Turkey.
The Agency for International Development estimates that more than a million Kurds have already crossed into Iran, and that another 500,000 are heading toward the Iranian border. European governments, working with Teheran, have been the primary source of assistance for the refugees streaming into Iran, while Washington has devoted almost all its attention to dealing with the estimated 820,000 Kurds who have entered Turkey or gathered along the Turkish frontier.
On the Iranian aid request, Andrew S. Natsios, director of the Office of United States Foreign Disaster Assistance, said, "We need a specific list of what they need."
The United States could either make a direct money donation to the Red Crescent Society, or airlift tents, blankets, water containers, plastic sheeting, and generators from warehouses in Guam and Singapore. Such aid would most likely be distributed by international and private aid organizations.
Depending on Iranian Government requests and political considerations, the Administration could either hire private planes to ship the aid to Teheran, or request that the International Red Cross and United Nations use their air fleets to do the job. Officials said it was unlikely that the United States Air Force would land in Iran.
The United Nations has reported that Iraqi refugees in Iran need tents, blankets and food. Including Afghans and Iraqis, Iran currently has about four million refugees, more than any other country in the world.
The United States has previously said it would assist international aid organizations that are trying to help the Kurds in Iran, but has hesitated to offer anything more than token support. No American aid officials are currently stationed in Iran. Since the war, Washington has granted $6 million to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and $2 million for the International Committee of the Red Cross for refugee assistance for the entire Iraqi refugee crisis. Of that money, American officials could not say how much has gone to Iran.
With the exception of a planeload of blankets supplied last week by Americare, a private relief group, there has been virtually no direct American aid to Iran. Private relief officials said they had virtually no infrastructure inside Iran because they have been made to feel unwelcome by Teheran in recent years.
 
Hostages and Ties to U.S.
 The European Community decided Thursday to send four C-130 planeloads of tents, beds and blankets to Iran. The International Red Cross has the largest program in Iran, fielding 6,000 people to administer 29 refugee camps with 250,000 people, and prepare another camp for an additional 40,000 refugees.
Administration officials said the prospect of a more direct American role in helping Iran would not translate into improved relations with Iran unless Teheran follows up by helping to arrange the release of American and other Western hostages held in Lebanon. The Iranians, for their part, appear to be uncertain whether to try to capitalize on the opening with Washington, and officials here report disagreement in Iran about whether to seek improved ties with the United States.
The officials speculated that President Hashemi Rafsanjani, whom they consider a moderate, could use the crisis to gain influence over radicals who wish to sustain the policies of the late Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, the founder of the Islamic fundamentalist Government of Iran.
Washington has not had diplomatic relations with Iran since April 1980, five months after the United States Embassy in Teheran was seized by Iranian militants and its American occupants taken hostage. The occupation lasted more than a year. Relations did not improve measurably last year, when Washington provided $685,000 in relief to Iran after an earthquake. Iranian officials later asserted that American aid was paltry.
 
Pressure From Aid Groups
 Members of Congress and officials of American humanitarian organizations are pressing the Administration to do more to help the refugees in Iran.
Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Democratic of Massachusetts and chairman of the Senate subcommittee on Immigration and Refugee affairs, issued a statement today saying: "A U.S. helping hand extended to Iran in this enormous crisis could be a golden opportunity to heal the divisive issues between our nations. There should be no further delay while people die."

HEADLINE: Bill Rates Mixed as Bond Prices Fall

BYLINE: By H. J. MAIDENBERG

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury bonds plunged and long-term interest rates soared late yesterday. But bill rates and other short-term Treasury debt issues remained narrowly mixed.
Dealers said prices of the longer Treasury issues had meandered in a narrow range until the Chicago bond futures market closed at 3 P.M.; then they began to tumble. As a result, the Treasury's bellwether long bonds, the 7 7/8 percent issue maturing February 2021, were offered at 95 29/32, down 24/32, or $7.50 for each $1,000 of face value, in late dealings. The price drop sent the long bond's yield up to 8.24 percent from 8.17 percent the day before and 8.14 percent a week ago. 
 On the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, the pivotal spot June Treasury bond futures contract finished at 95.22, down 19/32 on the day.
 
 Decline for Long Notes
 Meanwhile, the Treasury's long notes, the 7.75's of 2001, dropped by 18/32, to 97 21/32, while their yield climbed to 8.09 percent, from 8.01 percent the day before and 7.96 percent a week ago.
"While market analysts may speculate over whether or not the Fed will soon ease credit, dealers, investment managers and others making buy-sell decisions are more concerned about the supply of new Treasury paper due in the next few weeks," said Steven R. Richhiuto, chief financial economist at Barclays de Zoete Wedd Securities Inc.
Next week, for example, the Treasury plans to hold its monthly auction of two- and five-year notes, selling $21 billion worth. Mr. Ricchiuto said, "The poor auction results of the seven-year notes sold April 10 caused a bit of concern about next week's auctions of the shorter notes."
On Wednesday, the Treasury will auction $12 billion of new two-year notes, which traded on a when-issued basis to yield 7.04 percent, up from 7.02 percent the day before. On Thursday, $9 billion of five-year notes go on the block, and the when-issued yield on this issue rose to 7.79 percent, from 7.75 percent the day before.
An even larger series of auctions will take place May 7-9, when the Treasury holds its next quarterly refunding. An estimated $35 billion of notes and bonds will be auctioned.
As for the Federal Reserve, it did not intervene in the credit markets, probably because Federal funds traded well below the Fed's perceived target of 6 percent all day. The funds rate, which banks charge each other for temporary loans, is viewed as the basic cost of credit from which all other interest rates graduate upward. The funds traded at 5 13/16 for most of the day before closing at 5.75 percent.
Meanwhile, the discount rate on 90-day Treasury bills, which are most sensitive to the funds rate, rose a basis point, or a hundredth of a percentage point, to 5.75 percent; six-month bills rose 2 basis points, to 5.77 percent, but the one-year bills fell 3 basis points, to 5.91 percent.
Elsewhere in the fixed-income market, Tele-Communications Inc., priced $1 billion of zero-coupon convertible debentures, due in 2008, through Merrill Lynch & Company. The debentures were priced at $297.99 per $1,000 of face value, and if held to maturity would yield 7.25 percent a year over the life of the issue.
 
Convertible at $18.06 Price

Moreover, the issue is convertible into common stock at a price of $18.06. Tele-Communications' share price closed yesterday at $16 on the Nasdaq.
The underwriters said the debentures were rated Ba-23 by Moody's Investors Service and BBX by the Standard & Poor's Corporation.
Caterpillar Inc. priced $300 million of 9 percent noncallable debentures, due in 2006, at 99.983, which would yield investors 9.125 percent. Lehman Brothers is the underwriter. The issue is rated A-2 by Moody's and A- by S.& P.
And the Student Loan Marketing Association priced $300 million of 7.35 percent notes, due in 1994, through Goldman, Sachs & Company. The Sallie Mae notes will be offered to investors at various prices from time to time, the underwriter said.

HEADLINE: U.S. Orders Write-Offs By Big Banks

BYLINE: By MICHAEL QUINT

 BODY:
American bankers were told by Federal regulators earlier this week to write off 20 percent of their loans to Brazil and 10 percent of their loans to Argentina as losses, bankers said yesterday.
The write-offs are not expected to hurt bank earnings because banks set aside billions of dollars in reserves in 1987 and 1989 to cover such losses. Bank profits are reduced when funds are set aside in the reserve for loan losses, not when a loan loss is declared and the reserve is reduced on the books. 
 "The loans to less-developed counties are now a potential problem for only a handful of banks," noted Mark Gross, a banking analyst at I.B.C.A. Ltd., a bank rating firm. He noted that Citicorp, Chase Manhattan, Manufacturers Hanover, and BankAmerica had reserves of less than 50 percent of outstanding medium- and long-term loans to less-developed counties. Those reserves may need to be increased in future years, he said, though recent improvements in the economies of several Latin American countries have improved the outlook for debt repayment.
Citicorp, the largest American bank lender to the two countries, said yesterday in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission that it would subtract from its loss reserve $715 million, an amount equal to the loans it must charge off. At the end of the first quarter, Citicorp had $2.3 billion of reserves for $7.5 billion of medium- and long-term loans to less-developed countries in financial trouble. About $3.4 billion of those loans were "cash basis," meaning that the countries' financial troubles were severe enough that interest is recorded only when it is received, not when accrued.
The write-offs, which come when both countries are far behind in interest payments, are a formal recognition by regulators that banks are never likely to collect full payment on the loans. In July, banks were told to write off 20 percent of their loans to both countries. American banks have now been required to write off 40 percent of their Brazilian loans and 70 percent of Argentine loans.
Traders of defaulted bank loans to Brazil and Argentina said yesterday that the action by American regulators had been widely anticipated and did not cause much change in prices of either country's debt. Brazilian loans were offered yesterday at about 28.125 cents on the dollar, not much changed from the beginning of the week, and Argentine loans were offered at 22.5 cents on the dollar.
Both Brazil and Argentina have recently been making partial interest payments. The two countries are suffering sharp downturns.

HEADLINE: Apartment Dwellers Prepare for Service Workers' Strike

BYLINE: By IVER PETERSON

 BODY:
Negotiators began round-the-clock talks for a new contract yesterday as apartment owners completed preparations to do their own building chores while a strike deadline of 12:01 A.M. Sunday drew near for 25,000 doormen, porters, elevator operators and other service workers.
Residents in co-op and condominium buildings will have to watch their own lobbies, take out their buildings' garbage and help one another with minor repairs. Owners of rental buildings have to make other arrangements for their tenants. 
 Britten Kent, president of the board of her co-op building at 155 East 73d Street near Lexington Avenue, said residents had stocked up on garbage bags and topped the oil tank because fuel delivery drivers may not cross picket lines if a strike comes.
"Everybody pitches in and supports each other," she said. "We have sent out a general alert to tenants to be aware that they must be security-conscious and that they may be slightly inconvenienced."
 
The Issue Is Money
 James F. Berg, who directs the Realty Advisory Board on Labor Relations, the owners' bargaining group, said the unresolved issues were economic.
"They have a long list of demands, but I think the central core is economic: more pay, costs of benefits," he said, declining to go into detail. His association has 2,800 co-op, condo and rental buildings in all the boroughs except the Bronx, and in Nassau and Suffolk Counties.
Gus Bevona, head of Local 32B-32J of the Building Service Employees International Union, did not respond to repeated requests made since last week for comments on the talks. The law firm of Manning Raab Dealy & Sturm, which represents the local, also did not return calls.
Doormen, elevator operators, porters and other service employees receive $462.73 a week under the current three-year contract, which took effect in 1988 and ends on Sunday, according to the Realty Advisory Board. Handymen make $503 a week and superintendents, who belong to the same union but whose contract does not expire until June 20, receive from $500 to $650 a week, plus housing and utilities if they live in their buildings. The Advisory Board contract generally sets the pattern for nonmember buildings as well.
Wages have been increasing by about 5 percent a year, Mr. Berg said, reflecting the relatively prosperous state of the city's housing market when the contract was signed three years ago. Since then, the market has turned downward, and owners also face the prospect of sharply higher taxes and other expenses.
The last two strikes by the service employees, for a week in 1979 and for 12 days in 1976, came at times when the real-estate market was similarly weakened. There was no consensus among board members and building managers as to the likelihood of a strike.
But Mr. Berg conceded that building owners' economic conditions were a factor at the bargaining table.
 
The Benefit of a Strike
 "The city has already proposed to increase taxes by a large amount, and there are other problems with financing and problems with meeting current maintenance payments by co-operators," he said. "In rental buildings there are even difficulties in renting vacancies, something we have hardly ever seen in New York City before."
Paul Brensilver, head of Streamline Management, said the owners of some buildings his company manages think a strike will save them money.
"They're looking at this in a positive way, as a way to close their maintenance gap," Mr. Brensilver said. "They are actually looking forward to an eight-week strike because it would solve their budget problem."
Co-op owners will generally have to carry their own garbage to the curb if there is a strike, share duties as lobby-watchers and go down to receive deliveries themselves, said Mary Ann Rothman, director of the Council of New York Cooperatives, an apartment owners' group.
The council has also advised buildings to line up security services to watch the lobby during hours that the apartment owners will not, generally the night shift.
Gordon Hough, president of his co-op at 255 West End Avenue near West 72d Street, was philosophical about the prospect of co-op owners having to dirty their hands.
"It all depends on how you view it," he said. "If you think it's something that needs to be done, you can handle it. But if you think taking out your garbage is an intolerable burden, it will be harder for you."

HEADLINE: Cocaine Use and Infant Mortality Decline Together in New York City

BYLINE: By CELIA W. DUGGER

 BODY:
A decline in the use of cocaine by pregnant women and improved prenatal care last year helped significantly reduce infant mortality in New York City for the first time in four years, city and state health officials said yesterday.
The decline in the infant death rate for 1990, based on preliminary tallies by the State Health Department, is a relief to health officials, who had watched two decades of progress erode as crack, homelessness, AIDS and deepening poverty devastated poor families. 
 But the city's preliminary infant mortality rate for last year is still 25 percent higher than the national rate, which continued to fall in the years that New York City's rate climbed. On average, five babies a day died in the city before their first birthdays in 1990.
 
In Poor Areas, High Death Rates
 Infant mortality also continues to be a stark measue of the chasm between economic classes and racial groups in the city, according to a report released this week by the Greater New York March of Dimes and the United Hospital Fund of New York.
Infants in the 10 poorest neighborhoods of the city died at twice the rate of babies in the 10 wealthiest areas, the study found. Black babies died at two-and-a-half times the rate of white babies. The conclusions were based on city data from 1987 through 1989, the most recent information available by race and neighborhood.
The city's infant mortality rate worsened in 1987 and 1988 and leveled off in 1989. Last year, it declined to 12.1 deaths in 1,000 live births, from 13.1 in 1989, according to projections by the State Health Department.
Karla Damus, the research director for family health services in the city Health Department, said a study of more than 120,000 of the 142,000 birth certificates in 1990 found that the rate of cocaine use among pregnant women also fell significantly, part of what she said was the larger trend of lower cocaine use in the city. The city collects information about drug use on the confidential portion of birth certificates.
"Crack exposure is beginning to turn the corner," Mrs. Damus said.
Babies whose mothers used cocaine during pregnancy in 1989 had a mortality rate more than three times the average rate. The babies were at higher risk not only because their mothers used cocaine, but also because the women were likelier to be poor, homeless, malnourished, sick and battered by their spouses, and less likely to receive prenatal care, said Stephen Kandall, the chief of neonatology at Beth Israel Medical Center.
 
Signs of Decreasing Crack Use
 Though experts say crack is still ravaging many families, there are other statistical signs that its use in the city is decreasing.
Child abuse reports, which rose to 59,353 in 1989, from 41,454 in 1986, dropped to 55,158 in 1990 and are expected to decline further this year, according to city child welfare statistics.
"There is anecdotal evidence that crack use is down among women having children," said Sheila Jack, the spokeswoman for the city's Human Resources Administration.
Cocaine-related emergency room admissions in the city were also down in 1990, as were cocaine-related drug arrests, according to the State Division of Substance Abuse Services.
 
Crack 'Peaked in 1988'
 "You've run the course of the epidemic," said Dr. David A. Bateman, chief of newborn services at Harlem Hospital. "Initially, there were a lot of new recruits to crack. It was fashionable. It peaked in 1988. There haven't been as many new people attracted to the drug. We see the same people over and over."
Tim Smith, senior biostatistician in the State Health Department, cautioned that the city's infant mortality rate for 1990 would probably be somewhat higher when the final tally of births and deaths was completed. "But I'm sure it will be down," he said. "It dropped quite a bit."
Another factor cited by Federal Government statisticians in the decline of infant mortality nationally last year was the introduction of a new drug that helps prevent deaths of premature babies from sudden respiratory failures.
But Dr. Bateman and Dr. Leonard Glass, a neonatologist at Kings County Hospital Center, minimized the role of that medical advance.
 
The Difference of Prenatal Care
 "Possibly that helped me save a couple of babies. But it wouldn't account for a major drop. It's a little blip," Dr. Glass said.
Improved prenatal care helped save the lives of some infants, Mrs. Damus said. In 1990, the state extended Medicaid coverage to more poor pregnant women. The city's infant mortality initiative, which began in 1988 by serving fewer than 1,000 women, is now in full swing, she said. More than 4,000 women received comprehensive prenatal care and follow-up care for the first year of their babies' lives through the program in 1990.
Prenatal care makes a big difference, according to the March of Dimes analysis of city data. The babies of addicted women who received prenatal care were a third less likely to die in infancy than drug-exposed babies whose mothers received late care or no care. One in seven pregnant women in New York City received late or no prenatal care in 1989, the March of Dimes report found. Similar information is not yet available for 1990.
An obstetrician and gynecologist at New York University Medical Center, Dr. Machelle Harris Allen, tried to explain the importance of prenatal care to 30 philanthropic organizations who gathered on Thursday for the presentation of the March of Dimes-United Hospital Fund report, Infants at Risk: Solutions Within Our Reach.
Dr. Allen treated 45 pregnant addicted women in 1989 and 1990 at Bellevue Hospital Center. All but one gave birth to healthy full-term babies, she said.
 
Drugs, Alcohol and AIDS
 One woman she treated smoked crack, sipped rum and tested positive for the AIDS virus. About halfway through her pregnancy, she stopped using drugs and was admitted to the hospital for 10 days when Dr. Allen discovered she had syphilis, a disease that a woman can pass on to her fetus.
"She gave birth to a healthy baby at term. She got a two-bedroom apartment and went home with her baby," Dr. Allen said.
But the story has a sad ending. The intensive attention that Dr. Allen gave the pregnant woman did not continue when she became a new mother. The woman returned to drugs and drink and lost her baby to foster care.
There are still only a handful of residential drug-treatment programs in the city that allow women to keep their children, said David Condliffe, director of the Mayor's Office of Drug Abuse Policy. The city is reviewing 32 proposals for new treatment programs intended to help pregnant women and mothers of young children get off drugs, and will award $5.5 million in contracts for such programs, unless the fiscal crisis results in cuts in financing, he said.
Improved drug treatment and better prenatal care are essential elements in reducing infant deaths, Mr. Condliffe said. "The problem isn't that these women don't know about Piaget's theories of child development," he said. "It's that the refrigerator was empty because the mother was feeding her addiction, not her kid."

HEADLINE: All Walks of Life Now Converge In New York City's Jobless Lines

BYLINE: By ALAN FINDER

 BODY:
The slide that began three years ago on Wall Street has now ricocheted throughout the city's economy, claiming jobs in everything from banking to auto repair. As the recession continues to deepen, tens of thousands of New Yorkers are discovering its pain, finding themselves in unemployment lines that are growing longer and ever-more democratic.
More than 100,000 people lost their jobs in New York City in the last three years, government analysts say. And the number of people who were laid off and applied for unemployment insurance reached an eight-year high in the last month. 
 Even jobs that are sometimes viewed as a last resort for New Yorkers struggling to make it through hard times -- jobs like waiters and waitresses, sales clerks, office temporaries -- are in very short supply.
Dawn Salvesen, who has worked for 10 years as a waitress in Manhattan pubs, lost her job the day after Christmas and has been looking for a new one ever since.
 
'There Is Nothing Out There'
 "The last few ads I answered, there were 50 people there for the job," said Ms. Salvesen, who is 30 years old and lives in the Bensonhurst section of Brooklyn. "There is nothing out there."
Nationally, the number of people filing new claims for unemployment benefits climbed to 543,000 in late March, the highest level since January 1983. The number of new claims plunged during the following two weeks, suggesting to some economists that the end of the national downturn may be in sight.
In New York City, though, the number of new unemployment claims reached an eight-year high in late March and has remained at that level, about 10,000 each week, according to the State Department of Labor.
"This is not your typical, run-of-the mill recession," said Samuel M. Ehrenhalt, regional commissioner of the Federal Bureau of Labor Statistics. In a typical recession in New York, he said, about two-thirds of the jobs lost are in manufacturing. This time the impact is much broader.
The human suffering that accompanies a recession is often unseen. But a week of interviews with dozens of unemployed New Yorkers at offices of the State Department of Labor in Manhattan, Queens and Brooklyn demonstrated that the pain is pervasive.
A fine-arts auctioneer, let go last November after 10 years at a Manhattan auction house, talked of his anxieties: His severance pay has run out, there are no openings in his field and he is fighting eviction from his apartment.
A 33-year-old woman who was laid off last January from her job as an office clerk wondered how she and her husband would pay their bills. They have five children.
A 68-year-old retired employee of the Social Security Administration lost her part-time job as a telephone marketer in Queens. The loss of that income -- about $125 a week -- has forced her to eliminate all luxuries.
 
People of All Kinds
 If nothing else, the financial fallout is democratic. The crowds seeking unemployment insurance include people of all races, ethnic backgrounds and social classes -- from messengers and maintenance men in jeans and T-shirts to accountants and lawyers in pin-striped suits. How the recession is affecting each varies widely, depending on everything from personal savings to marital status to state of mind.
Ms. Salvesen, the waitress from Brooklyn, wore green fatigues when she bicycled last week to the State Labor Department's office on Kings Highway in Bensonhurst to file her claim.
Although Ms. Salvesen lost her job more than three months ago, she waited to apply for her unemployment benefits because she never expected to have trouble finding a job. There was another reason, too. "It's pride, I guess," she said.
But Ms. Salvesen, who is married to a city police officer, said she had used up her savings and could no longer afford the luxury of pride. She said she spends three days a week walking Manhattan neighborhoods, asking about work at restaurants.
"It's driving me crazy," she said. "I'm bored. I need to keep busy. I'm just going to keep looking until I eventually find something."
But as the number of layoffs builds, the unemployed are finding it harder to find work. The average time that people remain on unemployment insurance has climbed to nearly 20 weeks, also an eight-year high, according to the State Labor Department. Many workers who have pounded the pavement longer than Ms. Salvesen say their morale is sinking.
Al Perez, a 31-year-old laborer from Corona, Queens, was among 80 people laid off last September by a large computer-assembly plant in Brentwood, L.I. His 26 weeks of eligibility for unemployment insurance has expired; he got his final check last week. He has no idea where or when he will find work. He said there are no factory jobs available. He is willing to work in a restaurant -- he was once a waiter and busboy -- but there are no openings.
"Everyone says, 'Wait, we'll call you,' " he said. "But it's all promises, promises."
Some people feel desperate. A 40-year-old man, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said he had been searching for six months for a job as a restaurant manager. Fluent in French and Spanish, he said he had run dining rooms in major hotels for 15 years. He had never been out of work for more than a month.
 
Under the Suit, Desperation
 Dressed in a beige summer suit with a blue shirt and a red knit tie, and carrying a brown briefcase, he looked through computerized job listings at the Labor Department office on West 20th Street at the Avenue of the Americas. But his attire and surface calm belied the anxieties that he said had overtaken him.
"My unemployment is running out in two weeks," he said. "My savings are gone. I don't know what I am going to do. I need a job immediately."
He has had countless interviews, but only three involved actual openings. He is divorced, with a son to support, and he pays a high rent in Manhattan.
"It's scary out there," he said.
Older people with family responsibilities often feel a heavier burden than those who are young or single. People cushioned by savings can be more patient than those without.
Michael Posner, 34, is a Manhattan resident with a bachelor's degree in marketing and 10 years experience working for clothing manufacturers. He was laid off last May, a victim, he said, of the falloff in retail sales and the competition from imports. It is his first time out of work, Mr. Posner said, and he is trying to take the long view.
"I decided not to freak out over it," he said. He works a few days a month for a friend in the travel business and spends a lot of time at a gym or in museums when he is not looking for work. He ran out of unemployment benefits months ago, but he is getting by on his savings and the occasional work. He keeps his equilibrium, he said, by reminding himself that the economic forces that produced his unemployment should also eventually provide him with a job.
"I'm just a statistic of the times, I think," Mr. Posner said. "I don't look at myself as the problem, but as the result of the shrinking of the industry."
"I think this is a cycle, and I think it will pass," he added.
As the recession has worsened, it has touched more and more blue-collar workers, who often lack the savings -- and the confidence -- that are propping up people like Mr. Posner.
Phil Pasquale, a stocky auto mechanic from Bay Ridge with a crewcut and an open, friendly demeanor, has been buffeted by the economy in the last few years. He has been laid off twice by auto dealers in Brooklyn, most recently a year ago. He then worked as a fill-in driver for the United Parcel Service. He would report for work in Queens at a daily "shape-up." If he was needed, he would be given a route; if not, he would be sent home without pay.
Mr. Pasquale was lais off from that job two weeks ago. "It's like you come to the realization that the world goes on without you," he said, as he waited to apply for unemployment insurance in Bensonhurst.
Mr. Pasquale said he did not know how much he would get each week; the maximum is now $280 a week, more than he expects to receive. To get by, he said, he would have to sell his car, a 1979 Cadillac that he fixed up himself. Mr. Pasquale hopes to sell the car for $6,000, or twice what he paid.
After working nearly five years as a mechanic, Mr. Pasquale is bitterly disappointed to be unemployed.
"I figured if I had a skilled trade, I'd be able to get ahead," Mr. Pasquale said. "It's a cruel world."
Part-time and temporary workers have been among those hit hardest, as have young people trying to start their careers. Marilyn Davis, a 40-year-old mother of two from Manhattan, worked for 10 years as a secretary on Wall Street. She started working as a temporary secretary three years ago.
 
One Day in Three Months
 "I think I've worked one day in the past three months," Ms. Davis said as she waited in line at the Manhattan unemployment office on West 20th Street. "With the recession, temps are the first to be let go."
She said she had been looking for a job, either temporary or full-time, for months. She responds to advertisements, has had many interviews, but has received no offers.
Meanwhile, she and her husband, a schoolteacher, struggle to get by. "It's really hard now," she said. "You juggle your bills."
"Does it depress me?" she said. "Here I get $250. When I work, I get $600 a week. I need to work."
So does Greg Cozine, a 23-year-old from Westhampton Beach, L.I., who graduated last year with a major in business from the University of Delaware. He has been looking for a banking job ever since.
Standing in line at the West 20th Street office, Mr. Cozine was dressed as if he already had a banking job, wearing a blue suit, a white button-down shirt, a red tie and black loafers. He said he wears the suit to visit employment agencies; he had been to 15 or 16. But it is likely to go back in his closet for a while. Few if any jobs are available in banking, and he fears he may have to go back to summer gardening in Westhampton Beach.

HEADLINE: Summer Goal Is Keeping Youth Safe

BYLINE: By FELICIA R. LEE

 BODY:
Seeking to head off a summer of boredom and potential violence as children are caught in gunfire and their parents face the economic pressures of a recession, the Dinkins administration yesterday detailed its plan for summer jobs, counseling and school-based programs for young people.
The $8 million program, financed in part by the Mayor's criminal-justice plan, includes tickets to recreational events, lessons in dispute mediation and academic counseling. 
 "Every summer our children are caught in the crossfire of the dealers and the muggers -- their hopes and dreams shattered in the spray of stray bullets," Mayor David N. Dinkins said.
City officials said they moved up announcing the program, Youth Futures, Safe Summer '91, by a month because of three days of unrelated incidents in which eight bystanders were caught in the crossfire of gunfights. Two died; six were wounded. Six children were among them.
 
Comparisons With Last Summer
 In the most recent bystander shooting, a 13-year-old boy playing pool inside a Bronx social club Thursday night was shot in the leg by someone driving by in a car.
More than a dozen children have been hit by bullets in the last month in shootings in which they were the intended victims or were bystanders, according to police reports. Recently, Mr. Dinkins visited the hospital bed of a Brooklyn boy wounded as he stood a few feet from where the police fired on people alleged to be drug dealers.
"They're not kids anymore when they have to live like this," Richard L. Murphy, the Youth Services Commissioner, said yesterday.
The recent shootings have led to comparisons with last summer, when 29 children were shot and eight of them killed over three months. After that violence and demands that the Mayor do something, Mr. Dinkins announced his criminal-justice plan to hire thousands more police officers and provide comprehensive youth services.
 
Jobs, Activities and Outreach
 "I know that some believe we should deal with crime through police and the criminal-justice system alone," Mr. Dinkins said. "But I reject that notion. That sort of one-dimensional approach offers no alternative to the growing allure of crime and drugs."
At a City Hall news conference yesterday, the Mayor and other city officials described new programs.
Among them, a Neighborhood Youth Alliance for 5,000 youths from 11 to 21 years old is intended to address a variety of communication skills. In another program, street outreach workers from several city agencies will seek out young people and try to involve them in school-based activities and drug-prevention efforts.
The Department of Employment will offer jobs in libraries, hospitals, day-care centers and offices to 27,000 people from 14 to 21. Ten schools will be open 16 hours a day every day to offer programs intended to reduce drug use and help communities get organized. Tickets for plays, ball games and other activities will be distributed.

HEADLINE: New Jersey Schools Warn Parents on Cuts

BYLINE: By PETER KERR, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LAWRENCE, N.J., April 19

 BODY:
Grappling with the effects of a tax revolt, school districts around the state are warning parents to expect serious cuts in services in the next school year.
Critics in Trenton say such warnings are just the keening of bureaucrats, who refuse to cut budgets layered with fat. But anxiety and bitterness are rife in places like Lawrence High School, part of a district that the state classifies as relatively affluent and that is proud of its academic achievements. 
 "There is a sinisterness to all this," William Tucker, a 43-year-old history teacher, said. "If they can't make all schools the same by bringing the lower schools up, they must bring the upper schools down."
After the Legislature placed tight caps on school spending last month, the Lawrence district announced cuts in high school teacher positions, summer school, sports and the purchase of textbooks.
Administrators said they feared that even that scaled-back budget might be rejected in voting on April 30.
In five years Lawrence is scheduled to lose more than $3 million in state aid for pension and Social Security costs as a result of the Quality Education Act. The act, together with a State Supreme Court decision last year, was intended to shift aid to poorer and middle-income districts, to make spending more equitable across the state.
As a result, teachers, students and parents here are focusing on two central questions: How far can the district cut without harming education? And does a plan to help poorer districts have to harm richer ones?
 
'I'm Being Penalized'
 "I'm being penalized for attending a good school," Tom Haller, 17, a junior, said. "Its outrageous."
The concern began to rise last year when Gov. Jim Florio and Democrats in the Legislature pressed into law the Quality Education Act, which intends to raise $1.1 billion from increased income taxes for school aid and property-tax relief. Under the plan, major parts of the aid for the wealthiest districts will taper off after five years. Wealthier districts like Lawrence would then have to choose between cutting expenses and raising property taxes.
After the election in November, when voters expressed rage at the tax increases, the Democratic president of the Senate, John A. Lynch of New Brunswick, pushed through legislation shifting $360 million from school aid to property-tax relief. The legislation, which Mr. Florio signed month, places caps of 7.5 to 9 percent on spending increases in most districts, except some poorer ones. Those are allowed increases of up to 20 percent.
Since then, administrators from many of the 616 districts in the state have complained that the caps do not permit their schools to keep up with sharply rising costs, including labor contracts and insurance.
In Cherry Hill, officials say 44 employees, including 25 teachers, will be eliminated. In Princeton, the superintendent says she plans to eliminate 10 teaching positions and increase the average class size to 22 or 23 from 21.
Even administrators in some poor districts like as Newark and Jersey City say the new caps mean much of their increased aid will go to property-tax relief, forcing them to delay plans for preschool programs and smaller classes. Under the Lynch bill, $82 million of the $288 million of increased aid promised to the 30 poorest districts now has to go to ease property taxes.
 
Pressure Against Caps
 "The most damaging thing has been the psychological impact of the tax revolt, not just the dollars alone," said Superintendent Fred Stokley of Ridgewood, where voters defeated a school bond issue, 2 to 1, in December. "Schools have become the target."
An education aide to Mr. Florio, Thomas Corcoran, said many school boards were trying to use shock tactics to scare voters into approving their proposed budgets. After a decade in which school budgets rose more than 10 percent a year, he said, the districts, like the rest of government, have to adapt to a new austerity.
School districts are receiving $4.5 billion in aid this year, including more than $500 million in increases. Nonetheless, 97 districts asked the State Education Department for permission to spend more than their caps allow. More than 50 other districts plan to ask the permission of voters to do so on April 30.
"We urge the public not to be duped by any school bureaucrat with a six-figure salary who says the only way to save the football team is to let the school board exceed its state-mandated caps," Mr. Lynch said.
 
Courses and Extracurriculars
 On a recent day in Lawrence High School, the voices of a choral group singing madrigals wafted through the halls. A sign near the entrance boasted of a student who had won a national music competition in Florida. Another sign asked for volunteers for a production of Dylan Thomas's "Under Milkwood." A few doors away, students typed on some of the 18 computer terminals in the writing laboratory.
Superintendent Barry L. Gleim said that after officials in Trenton had informed him that he faced a 7.75 percent cap on increased spending, he cut $1 million from a budget of more than $31 million. The district employs 506 people.
The district plans to cut back on elective courses, which include honors Latin, genetics and aerospace technology. Several teaching positions will disappear in the high school, he said, as will a substance-awareness coordinator and coaches for activities like football, basketball and cheerleading and the color guard.
The problem, Mr. Gleim said, was that 80 percent of the district costs were fixed for the year, including a 28 percent rise in insurance premiums and the third year of a teachers' contract with 10 percent raises. The starting salaries for teachers is $24,500 a year. Mr. Gleim is paid $102,000.
 
In Case of Failure
 "These contracts were signed years ago, when the economy was healthy," Mr. Gleim said. "Education has been playing catch-up for an awfully long time."
Mr. Gleim said he feared that voters would a budget that would raise property taxes 5.8 percent. In February they defeated a referendum for $17 million in bonds for a new school by more than 2 to 1. If the budget fails, it would be left to the Township Council to work out a new one.
An 11th grader, Susan Suh, 16, said the student body was rife with rumors that sports and advanced-placement courses would soon disappear. Academic achievement, she said, is a central concern for her family, including her father, who arrived from Korea in poverty 17 years ago and became a vice president at the Bank of New York.
Miss Suh said she had signed up for four advanced-placement courses next year, which she hoped would improved her chance of being admitted to Princeton University. But, she added, she fears that by the time she becomes a senior the college-level courses will disappear and that she will be at a disadvantage in competing with top students from other schools.
"Without them, I wonder how colleges would look at me," she said. " It's not fair. It's not my fault."

HEADLINE: Haitian Music From Another Era

BYLINE: By TIM GOLDEN

 BODY:
Some minutes after the appointed time, 10 P.M., Le Manoir was still half-empty. Back from the dance floor, men in suits and open-necked shirts crowded the bar, calling in Creole for their next Heineken, their next Black Label and turning smiles on the women behind them.
The club owner, Lesly Mirville, glanced at his watch. Ignoring the empty tables, he smoothed the front of his blazer, a double-breasted number that funneled his large torso into an improbable V. Outside, the strip of Nostrand Avenue that is a main drag of Haitian Brooklyn was not yet double-parked. 
 With the humility of a local dance band, the Orchestre Tropicana d'Haiti started up anyway.
As if beckoned by the lilting sound, big cars clogged the street outside. Bouncers came to attention and the doors began flapping open, letting in more men in dark suits, led by more women in bright dresses. Mr. Mirville spread a pair of satisfied fingers over his pencil mustache and smiled.
 
Something Special Indeed
 Elsie Boursiquot, who had arrived early, came alive in her seat.
"This is very special!" insisted the 25-year-old woman, a lab technician from Cap-Haitien and Flatbush. "Every time they come I miss Haiti."
In a world as vibrant as that of Haitian music in New York, "special" is a tag of some consideration. On this Sunday night, like every weekend night, other clubs in Brooklyn, a couple in Queens and Manhattan and perhaps another in New Jersey were filled with "mini-jazz," the driving, electrified dance music that has moved Haitians here -- and Haiti from a distance -- since the 1970's.
But a performance of Orchestre Tropicana is something that happens in New York maybe once a year, maybe twice.
Amid the frantic synthesizers and fast guitars of smaller bands that play a form of Haiti's traditional roiling, effervescent rhythms -- referred to as "compas direct" -- but have come of musical age while living and working in Brooklyn, Tropicana echoes from an age gone by. Like its younger counterparts, the 19-piece orchestra weaves a complex fabric of discrete, steady rhythms. But its music freezes a time of big bands and big dances when a fast dance could still be a close one and plaintive baritones and swinging horns were still exciting, romantic stuff.
 
The Distant Roots
 Compared with the guitar-driven compas arrangements that New York-based groups like Tabou Combo, System Band and Skah Shah have patiently made popular outside the Haitian community, Tropicana's music is so gently paced as to seem rooted in another country. And in some ways it is.
In Miami, Montreal and especially Brooklyn, younger Haitian musicians have spent the last decade or so soaking up contemporary African rhythms, American pop and instrumental jazz as well as other music from the Francophone West Indies. Tropicana, which remains firmly based in Cap-Haitien, on Haiti's northern coast, on the other hand, remained a repository of Caribbean sounds without regard to their linguistic origin.
During two of its recent five-hour nights in Brooklyn (the band will play tonight at St. Joachim and Anne Church in Hollis, Queens, and tomorrow at the Days Inn in Nanuet, N.Y.), Tropicana moved through the merengue of its Dominican neighbors, salsa from Puerto Rico and cumbias from Colombia. Aficionados -- what the Haitians call les vrai melomanes -- would explain this as evidence of the breadth and suppleness of real Haitian compas rhythms. (They might also look askance at the eclecticism of bands like Tabou, which in a single song might refer to everything from the zouk music of Martinique and Guadeloupe to West African soukous to the theme from "My Three Sons.")
 
Playing to the People
 Haitians sometimes refer to Tropicana's as the old style. "Tropic," as the band is called, would prefer to be thought of as an institution.
"If there is any corner of Haiti that we don't play, it's because of some problem, like bad roads," said Cinna O. Charles, the band leader known as Ti Blanc. "But even in those places, they know Tropicana."
The pride of veteran band members refers to more than their having endured the political and economic hardships that other Haitian musicians fled. By the time members of L'Orchestre Caraibes reincarnated themselves 28 years ago as the L'Orchestre Tropicana, many of them had already been struggling for years to keep together.
The Orchestre Septentrional, Haiti's oldest big band, was already well established in Cap-Haitien, Tropicana's hometown. To Tropicana fans, anyway, Septen was the upper-class favorite, the band that Government bureaucrats, landowners and shopkeepers would see at the Rhumba Night Club -- and that poorer people saw only during street carnivals.
Tropicana, which found a home at a dowdier spot called the Vanvalou, counted some of the best early compas composers among its alumni. But that honor roll, which includes names like Namours Jean-Baptiste and Weber Sicot, could also be a list of those who grew desperate at Tropicana's tough straits and left to work elsewhere.
 
The Victory of Surviving
 "In a small town, the competition was fierce, and it was very, very difficult for two bands to survive," recalled Pierre Joachim, a Consolidated Edison accounting manager who grew up a Tropicana fan in Cap-Haitien. "It's some sort of victory that Tropicana is still playing."
Though the band no longer worries about feeding its members, its schedule shows no evidence of new comforts. Many of its shows are still the major events of small towns and villages, which reserve their turns a year in advance. (Tours of the United States generally wait until Easter time, when the work in Haiti slows.)
After years of lyrical fun at Septentrional's expense, Tropicana's songs are now more likely to revel in the band's own popularity. One of them, "Serum," gave half-serious voice the other night to fictional fans who sang in Creole, "Tropicana we love you/ You are the serum/ That treats all our ills."
Even more than the next generation of Haitian bands, whose political music generally touches only obliquely on the Haitian turmoil of the moment, Tropicana considers its serum strictly social.
"We are musicians, therefore we are apolitical," Mr. Charles insisted. "If the people are suffering, if the people are hungry, we sing about that. If the country needs a change, we ask for that change."
 
New Choice, Tough Choice
 A current hit, "Nou Refize Gran Moune," which roughly translates from Creole as "We Refuse to Grow Up," is the sort of composition Mr. Charles is talking about. "Our brothers are suffering," warns the song, which urges Haitians to come together. "They are dying of hunger/ Because you are eating every day."
At Le Manoir and the Rivoli, another Haitian club on Flatbush Avenue that also seemed to draw an all-Haitian audience, such Tropicana lyrics seemed to evoke more than the usual quotient of nostalgia.
"When we first came here in 1973, we had even more of a sense of that nostalgia," Mr. Charles said. "Many people didn't have their working papers, so they couldn't go home. And when they came to a dance, they were seeing Haiti through us."
But to some of Tropicana's audience, the reminders seemed more difficult at a moment when Haiti's political turmoil appears finally to have ended and the democracy for which so many hoped is in place. Now, many said, the exiles who dreamed of going home are having to confront the question of whether repatriation is worth the sacrifice of comforts that are still unavailable there.
"This gives me terrible nostalgia," said Yves-Rose Jean-Jacques, a student from Cap-Haitien and Flatbush. "I want to go back so much. And we will, some day."
For the moment, though, Miss Jean Jacques said, she would settle for Tropicana.

HEADLINE: Timely Help for Nicaragua

 BODY:
Gallantry abounded this week when Violeta Chamorro made the rounds in Washington, a year after her inauguration as President of Nicaragua. President Bush extolled her "exhilarating victory" over the Sandinistas. After she addressed Congress, a California Republican called her "a miracle in the Western Hemisphere." But her people can't eat bouquets, and the best news was Mr. Bush's offer to lead an international effort to help Nicaragua raise $360 million to make overdue payments on a crushing $9.4 billion foreign debt.
It's the least Washington can do. Nicaragua's economy shrank last year, while inflation soared. After a decade of Sandinista mismanagement and a U.S.-instigated contra war, Nicaragua sorely needs international help. It's embarrassing that Washington has disbursed only $207 million of $541 million pledged to a democratic regime that honors human rights and seeks economic reform. 
 Some American conservatives ungallantly fault Mrs. Chamorro's decision to retain Humberto Ortega, brother of the former President, as armed forces chief. Their grumbling is doubly unfair. It gives no weight to her success in reducing the army from 80,000 to 28,000, with further cuts promised. And it ignores the political reality that the Sandinistas lost an election, not a war. A similar need for reconciliation induced a democratic Government in Chile to retain a former right-wing dictator, General Pinochet, as armed forces chief -- without complaints in Washington.
Mrs. Chamorro's most formidable asset is her popularity; she is a healer, not an avenger. Everyone knows that the divisions in her country are mirrored in the conflicting politics of her children: one of her sons is editor of the Sandinista newspaper, Barricada, while another heads the family-owned and resolutely anti-Sandinista paper La Prensa.
She is opposed by die-hards at both extremes, either of which could have caused the unsolved murder of Enrique Bermudez, the former contra commander. Habits of violence persist, as does the winner-take-all view of politics. Striving for a better way, Mrs. Chamorro has earned American affection and international support.

HEADLINE: BankAmerica's Eastward Push

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, April 19

 BODY:
When the BankAmerica Corporation was reeling from losses a few years ago, executives renounced their global ambitions and said they would concentrate on retail banking in California and the West.
The bank's executives still say that, only now they joke that "West" means anything west of Bermuda. That is because BankAmerica is poised to make itself a major presence on the East Coast if it wins the bidding for the insolvent Bank of New England. 
 Even if BankAmerica is not chosen by Federal regulators, who are expected to announce their decision by Wednesday, bank executives and analysts say there will be other expansion opportunities for the San Francisco-based bank, the nation's second largest, after Citicorp.
 
 The Laughter Ends
 Only five years ago, BankAmerica, the parent of Bank of America, was the laughingstock of the industry. But through divestitures, employee layoffs and management changes it has made a breathtaking recovery and is now far stronger than most of its main competitors.
So, while the big New York banks and some California rivals nurse problems caused by a stack of bad real estate loans, BankAmerica is in a unique position to move to the forefront in the effort to create the first truly nationwide retail bank.
"The Bank of America could emerge as one of the few American banks that has got key critical market shares," said Thomas Hanley, banking analyst at Salomon Brothers. "If you give them another two to three years, they will truly be nationwide in scope."
BankAmerica has already spent about half a billion dollars for 12 institutions in the last 18 months, most of them insolvent savings and loans bought with Federal assistance. The acquisitions brought BankAmerica 373 new branches and $14 billion in deposits and expanded its network from California and Washington into six other Western states.
For a bank that had its own near-death experience just a few years ago, such a rapid expansion might seem foolhardy. The moves could risk diluting management and exposing BankAmerica to uncertain economies in New England and Arizona at a time when California's own economic outlook is uncertain.
Some industry executives and analysts have questioned in particular BankAmerica's bid for the Bank of New England. Even if BankAmerica gets a bank without bad loans, the bank still might not make money, they say. And managing an institution across the country might be hard.
Frank N. Newman, BankAmerica's vice chairman and chief financial officer, said BankAmerica thought the New England economy would eventually recover. He also said BankAmerica's international business gave it experience in running banks far afield. He said BankAmerica planned to keep many of the Bank of New England's managers, who are new and not considered responsible for the bank's failure.
Mr. Newman also said that the way the acquisitions were being handled, with regulators removing the bad loans from the failed institutions, removed much of the risk for the new owner. Indeed, buying failed institutions is turning out to be such an attractive way for banks to expand that Congress has started to criticize regulators for arranging deals that some lawmakers contend are too sweet.
 
A National Vision
 Mr. Newman said BankAmerica was being driven by a vision that "in the long run, national banking was just going to make sense for this nation and the decade of the 90's was when it's going to occur."
The bank had not been thinking of expanding elsewhere so soon, but as its New England bid shows, it is willing to jump if the opportunity presents itself. BankAmerica is believed to be interested in Illinois, the Mid-Atlantic region, and in Florida and other parts of the Southeast. But it is not particularly interested in New York, where the retail banking market is extremely competitive.
"We're trying to be careful about not getting caught up in manifest destiny," Mr. Newman said in an interview.
 
A Company Tradition
 Manifest destiny, as reflected in the name Bank of America, is part of the company's tradition, dating back to A. P. Giannini, who founded the bank in 1904 and built a multistate empire. But in 1958 the Federal Government forced the divestiture of banks outside California into what is today the First Interstate Bancorp.
Later, even though interstate banking laws kept it from buying branches in most states, BankAmerica tried to establish a nationwide presence in financial services by buying a consumer finance company and the Charles Schwab & Company discount brokerage.
But BankAmerica had to sell those units and part of its overseas operations to stave off financial collapse in the mid-1980's. The bank lost $1.8 billion from 1985 through 1987, largely because of bad loans in real estate, energy and agriculture and because of bloated expenses.
 
Broad Management Shifts

The divestitures, large layoffs and a nearly complete turnover in top management led to the bank's recovery. The bank concentrated on its California retail operations, which were revived under Richard M. Rosenberg, now the chairman and chief executive.
BankAmerica's common equity at the end of 1990 was 5.24 percent of its $110 billion in assets, one of the highest ratios among the large banks. BankAmerica's stock has also been strong, reaching a record high of $39.50 on Wednesday on the New York Stock Exchange. The stock closed today at $38.25, down 32.5 cents.
Last year BankAmerica earned a record $1.1 billion and analysts expect some growth this year, while most other banks will show declines. First-quarter earnings reported Thursday were about even with the period last year. The bank's profitability was held back by bad loans in real estate and for leveraged corporate takeovers.
But BankAmerica has fewer real estate and leveraged buyout loans than many big banks, partly because its weakness in the mid-1980's kept it from competing to make many of those loans. In a way, its problems then are responsible for the bank's strength now.
"The best thing that happened to Bank of America is it got hit by a 2-by-4 five years ago," said an official at a rival California bank.
In its current expansion binge, BankAmerica has been criticized at times for paying too much. When it bought the Benjamin Franklin Federal Savings and Loan Association in Portland, Ore., its $162 million bid was $50 million more than one from the Security Pacific Corporation.
But the real determination of whether the price was too high depends on how successful Bank of America is in turning the acquired savings institutions into commercial banks. Banks have feared that savings and loan customers were attracted only by the high interest rates those institutions offered and would leave once the rates were lowered.
But Bank of America is apparently keeping a vast majority of the customers. It will not say exactly how many because it considers that competitive information.
To hear Mr. Newman explain it, BankAmerica has made a science of digesting failed savings and loans. First it puts its name on the institution. It installs its own credit policies and banking products. It processes mortgage and consumer loan requests in special California processing centers and begins commercial lending services.
So far, the acquisitions have not strained BankAmerica's resources. Nor have they made much of a difference in earnings because the institutions, taken together, are still a fraction of the size of BankAmerica.
Even the Bank of New England, which would come with about $15 billion in assets after the bad loans are removed, would not make that much difference for BankAmerica. "For us to add another $2 billion S.& L. is not a major undertaking," Mr. Newman said.
 
The Strongest Bidder
 BankAmerica is clearly the strongest bank bidding for the Bank of New England, and could most easily supply the $750 million or so in capital that Federal regulators are expected to require of the winning bidder. But BankAmerica faces competition from two local bidders, the Bank of Boston and the Fleet/Norstar Financial Corporation, a Rhode Island banking company that is bidding in combination with Kohlberg, Kravis, Roberts & Company, the leveraged buyout specialists.
The Bank of Boston has argued that a local owner would be better. If that bank won, it could eliminate overlapping branches with the Bank of New England, achieving great cost savings.
But the Bank of Boston is itself losing money and might not be able to handle the acquisition. It recently strengthened its bid by arranging to sell $1 billion in new stock if it wins.
Fleet/Norstar argues that Kohlberg, Kravis will bring fresh capital into the banking system, whereas BankAmerica will only shift it from one region to another.
The issue is complicated. If BankAmerica wins, it could strengthen banking in the region and alleviate a credit squeeze. But if it uses its strength to gain too much market share from weakened local banks, it could contribute to more banking failures in the region.
Even if BankAmerica loses, there will be more Bank of New Englands in the future. Having seen its global ambitions cut short before, BankAmerica aims not to fail again.

HEADLINE: A Way Out of the CUNY Impasse

BYLINE: By Jerald Posman; Jerald Posman was vice chancellor of budget and finance at the City University from 1977 to 1984.

 BODY:
One of the most painful signs of New York City's fiscal crisis is the proposed tuition increase at the City University. In protest, students have occupied buildings at most of CUNY's 18 campuses. But there is no guarantee that a large tuition increase will raise revenue if it decreases enrollment among students of modest means.
For the poor and lower middle class, there is no better long-term investment than the cost of tuition at the City University. And for the state and city, there is no better long-term investment than to subsidize the costs of the City University. 
 This is not fantasy. This is the history of higher education in New York City for more than 150 years. College graduates in their lifetimes will earn, at least, two to three times more than those finishing high school, and the great majority of CUNY's graduates will continue to live and work in the city. No other government program does as much to make the city economically competitive and to break the relentless cycle of economic and social dependency.
Fifteen years ago, because of an unparalleled fiscal crisis, tuition was imposed at CUNY. Seventy thousand students left the university -- 30 percent of enrollment. The cost of that decline was immense.
Enrollment has increased some in the past few years with individuals and families making the hard but farsighted choice to invest in their futures. But since 1976, tuition has edged up to $1,450 per year, somewhat lower than many public universities but extremely costly given the situtation of most CUNY students.
Financial aid programs assist the most needy, but part-time working students are seldom eligible, and subsidies for those above the poverty line fall off sharply. And now the state and city are proposing that tuition be increased by $500 next year, on top of a $200 increase this semester.
What is needed to both solve today's fiscal problems and invest for tomorrow is a program of "tuition service credits" that allow students to provide government service instead of paying the tuition increase.
Full and part-time tuition would be frozen at $1,450 and financial aid programs would be kept intact. The tuition increase would be translated into hours of government service at $5 per hour. Instead of paying a $500 increase, a full-time student would perform 100 hours, or two and a half weeks, of government service.
Students could work their hours over time or all at once during the summer. Government agencies would record the hours worked and report to the college bursar when service was completed or at the end of the semester.
If service hours were not met, students would pay for the time not served or be unable to register the following year or graduate. If a student chose service one year but did not complete it and wanted to try again, he would pay the tuition increase up front and get reimbursed when service was completed.
If 100,000 students -- half the CUNY population -- took advantage of this program, it would generate 10 million hours of work, the equivalent of adding 6,000 employees to the city's depleted work force. The primary beneficiaries would probably be schools, parks, libraries, hospitals and recreational facilities. The program could also be the vehicle for developing internships that generate academic credit and careers.
This program is not cost-free. CUNY would lose revenue from students who elect service instead of a tuition increase. But the bulk of these funds could be made up from reduced financial aid and the savings realized in state and city budgets from the students' work.
In 1976, the city lost the potential of a generation of college graduates. Tuition service credit would avoid this fate for a new generation.

Discount Clubs Proliferate in Connecticut

BYLINE: By ELEANOR CHARLES

 BODY:
A FEW decades ago, "I can get it for you wholesale" was a refrain that sometimes presaged a rip-off, but often resulted in a terrific deal on anything from a sofa to a fur coat. But to get a deal, you needed a connection.
 Now all you need is transportation to the nearest factory outlet, discount store, or one of the mammoth wholesale clubs proliferating around the country. 
 The Northeast, perceived as a particular victim of the recession, has been targeted by wholesale-club companies as a fertile market for cash-and-carry discounting, and Connecticut, where four such stores have been established since 1987, can expect at least 10 more by 1993.
 One of the four is B.J's, based in Natick, Mass. It will open a store Thursday at Bullard Square in Fairfield. The 120,000-square-foot, no-frills mart off exit 24 of I-95 was converted from an enormous old brick foundry by Rosenshein Associates of New Rochelle, N.Y.
One end of the building will also house several independent shops and a 10-screen Loew's movie theater, which will be completed early next year, for a total of 235,000 square feet.
 Unlike the historic restoration of Bullards's, most wholesale clubs are austere, one-story cement-block buildings on lots of 10 to 20 acres with 750 to 1,500 parking spaces. In Connecticut, some are turning the recession to their advantage by buying up distressed properties that are already zoned properly for their purposes.
 Sam's Warehouse Club, a division of Wal-Mart of Bentonville, Ark., just broke ground in Manchester off exit 62 of I-84. The company is also working through the municipal approvals process for another store in Cromwell.
Arnold Peck, a Connecticut developer who has experienced some financial difficulties, owns the Cromwell property and a site in Orange.
"Sam's has contracted to buy both sites, contingent on each town's approving their plans," he said. "They will file an application in Orange May 17."
 Brenda Lockhart, spokeswoman for Sam's, said that the Manchester store would open by early 1992. The company has 178 stores in 30 states, with each having up to 10,000 business memberships and up to 35,000 individual memberships. "It's not uncommon for people to come from a radius of 100 miles," she said.
WHAT all wholesale clubs offer is a range of merchandise keyed to the region, stacked in bulk quantities on plain racks and sold at an average markup of only 8 percent. The annual membership fee is $25. Business owners, their employees and most individuals may obtain cards under criteria that vary from company to company. Some of the clubs occasionally waive the $25 fee but charge an extra 5 percent on purchases.
 Name brands of major appliances, electronics, computers, office and automotive supplies, generators, pet supplies, industrial fans, Jacuzzis, fresh and frozen foods, jewelry and clothing are among the items sold.
 Pace Membership Warehouses, a division of K-Mart of Troy, Mich., has submitted an application for a new store opposite Sam's in Manchester. Last year Pace built a store in Enfield and renovated a building in Berlin. The company operates 78 stores nationwide.
 "Properties that we buy run between $4 million and $6 million," said Charles Steinbrueck, president of Pace. "Construction runs around $4 million to $4.5 million. We try to form partnerships with developers who have strong financing abilities, but sometimes we look to self-development through K-Mart," he said.
Homart, the shopping center developer based in Chicago, and the Woodmont Group of Seattle are his partners in the Manchester venture.
Mr. Steinbrueck believes that wholesale clubs will inevitably invade midtown Manhattan and the retail precincts of other major cities.
"Property values are considerably higher than we can afford right now," he said, "but as shopping patterns continue to shift toward the suburbs, property costs will moderate and opportunities will arise."
 Sam's and Pace are additions to a burgeoning shopping enclave in Manchester. A Home Depot is under construction and a similar chain of building supply discounters called Builder's Square has applied for a building permit.
Up the hill on Buckland Hills Drive overlooking Route 84 is the Pavilions, a 900,000-square-foot mall that Homart opened in March 1990. Alongside the Pavilions is a 932-unit rental apartment development soon to be completed by Trammell Crow of Dallas.
 "There may be a little too much going on," said Mark Pellegrini, town planner for Manchester, "but there has been considerable population growth in the area." The Capitol Region Council of Governments notes that in the 10 square miles east of Hartford the population has increased by 13 percent, to 210,000, or more than 20,000 people in a decade.
 There has been none of the resistance to wholesale clubs that other large, traffic-generating projects usually inspire at the local level. Their location in nonresidential areas adjacent to highways minimizes congestion, and the lure of bargains in hard times is irresistible.
THE Price Club, oldest in the country, "from whom all the others were cloned," according to its president, Robert Price, bought a 17-acre shopping center in New Britain for $3 million last month. The buildings will be demolished to make way for a 166,000-square-foot facility scheduled to open in the fall of this year. Jeffrey Dunne, the broker at Coldwell Banker Realtors who handled the sale, is negotiating for Price on another site off I-95 in Bridgeport.
 Founded in San Diego in 1976 by Sol Price and his son Robert, the company was the first to come to Connecticut in 1987, with a store in North Haven. "We are unique in that we own without encumbrance all our land and buildings," said Robert Price. "We develop shopping centers adjacent to the store, generating substantial capital."
Sales in 1990 reached $6 billion among 58 stores in the United States and Canada.
 Costco, based in Kirkland, Wash., is the nation's fourth major company with Sam's, Price, and Pace. It is negotiating for four Connecticut sites and expects to complete construction by 1993. Jeff Brotman, company chairman, welcomes the competition.
"Wholesale shoppers will find themselves acquiring preferences for certain clubs just as retail shoppers choose the stores they like," he said.

HEADLINE: Avery Corman Examines Date Rape

BYLINE: By BARBARA LOVENHEIM

 BODY:
WHEN a college tennis star from an affluent family insists on having sex with a coed who tries to fight him off, can she sue him for sexual harassment?
If he succeeds, can she sue him for rape? 
 If he doesn't succeed, does she still have a case?
If they were necking before the seduction occurred and she was drinking, does that exonerate him, and implicate her?
If she was willing to go some of the way, is she still an innocent victim -- or a tease?
Does rape have to be accompanied by the threat of physical force? And what kind of physical force?
These are some of the thorny issues that Avery Corman, known for "Kramer v. Kramer," tackles in "Prized Possessions," a novel published by Simon & Schuster, about a freshman from a wealthy Manhattan family who is raped on a first date by an upperclassman from an even wealthier family.
 
'A Great Many Complications'

"It's a fascinating subject and goes to the heart of where we are in our culture in terms of the women's movement," Mr. Corman said in an interview in his apartment on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. "How far have we come if this is still a problem?
"The sexual revolution has spun off a great many complications -- coed housing, women who are not supposed to be virgins beyond a certain age, sexual freedom -- that are bound to be troublesome. But are we going to have more crimes?"
In preparation for the novel, Mr. Corman, who has owned a second home in Water Mill for 13 years, visited the State University at Stony Brook, where a report of a rape in 1989 led to demonstrations.
He also interviewed young men and women who converged in the Hamptons in the summer.
The story revolves around Elizabeth Mason, a freshman at an Ivy League college, who is violated sexually by Jimmy Andrews, an egotistical upperclassman, on a date in her first week on campus.
For several months she represses the incident. Eventually her rage surfaces and causes her to expose Jimmy in a series of fast-moving trials that wind up in a courtroom drama. When it becomes apparent that Elizabeth will triumph, she drops the charges.
Reviewers have praised the book, and Warner Brothers has optioned the screen rights. Mark Medoff, writer of "Children of a Lesser God," has been commissioned to write the screenplay.
But in a review in The New York Times Book Review on Jan. 13, Susan Fromberg Schaeffer objected to the ending. She said it seemed inconsistent with Elizabeth's rage and the magnitude of the crime.
Mr. Corman insists that the ending is defensible and consistent with Elizabeth's character and the complexities of the crime.
"I stand opposite people who want to view this subject without ambiguity," Mr. Corman said. "They seem to be looking for a politically correct position, and there is none. Elizabeth's choice at the end of the book is to make herself whole from within, and not from without. 
"If you take the view that all rape is the same, you link all college-age boys with pathological rapists who are raping women out of a perverse criminal mentality. And what is happening on college campuses is something else.
"The only way to make progress in this area is through seminars and orientation programs, which are now being done. If you go on with the view that all rape is the same, you are out to prove that all men are wrong, and you force the traditional view of men as eternal aggressors and women as eternal victims.
"This may be a politically correct position, but it doesn't get you anywhere or solve the problem. If you want to educate college students so they don't commit acts of violence, you have to begin with dialogue."
 
Man's Point of View

This is not the first time that Mr. Corman, a slim soft-spoken man in his mid-50's with a receding hairline, moustache and amiable style, has ruffled feminist feathers by looking at "a woman's issue" from a man's point of view.
In "Kramer v. Kramer," the courtroom drama published in 1977 about a custody battle between a mother who tries to reclaim her son after she had abandoned him, Mr. Corman took the unconventional view that men could be more effective parents than women and that fathers were often unfairly penalized in a legal system that automatically favored mothers.
"It did not make a lot of archfeminists happy," Mr. Corman said. "In an era when we were hearing about women's needs and women's rights, I decided to take a different tack and look at parenthood through the eyes of a father.
"Eventually Gloria Steinem admitted to me the book was a net gain,because it changed things in our culture for the better. After that, joint custody became a reality, and men took more interest in parenting."
Despite the volatile nature of many Corman novels, he does not present himself as a missionary or political radical. He says, tongue in cheek, that he is bourgeois.
He has been married to Judy Corman, director of volunteers for Phoenix House, for 23 years. They have two sons, Matthew, 19, a sophomore at Brown University, and Nicholas, 16, a sophomore at the Fieldston School.
They live in a spacious apartment with countrylike decor, couches upholstered with a floral pattern, glass and wood tables, an eat-in kitchen, plants, books and paintings. Mr. Corman works in an independent office during the week, he said, so he can spend weekends with his family.
The Cormans also try to spend as much time as possible in Water Mill.
"I love the light, the space, the food and the community we belong to," Mr. Corman said. His and Mrs. Corman's friends include writers, several drawn from a Sag Harbor softball team on which Mr. Corman has played short center field for more than 10 years.
He is known for his fast-moving and readable plots, sardonic commentaries on the upper classes and terse dialogue.
His turbulent childhood may be partly responsible for his sensitivity to families in crisis and social changes.
 
'A Fierce Directedness'

Born in New York City in 1935, Mr. Corman's parents were divorced when he was 4. Until the age of 14, he, his mother and sister lived with an aunt and uncle who were deaf mutes. Early on he mastered sign language.
"Deaf mutes have a very telegraphic way of speaking, a fierce directedness with no elegant embroidery," he said. "They rely not on a lot of shorthand symbols, but quite a lot of spelling out of words and a literalness of language. Perhaps that is why I'm more concerned with the emotional furniture of a person's life than the actual furniture."
After attending public schools in the Bronx, he graduated from New York University and intended to pursue a career in advertising. He worked a short time as a copywriter and in his mid-20's began writing educational films.
He also pursued a hobby, songwriting, which he used to do while riding the subway. He teamed up with a friend, intending to write musical comedies.
Eventually they separated, and Mr. Corman wrote two plays. One of them was nearly produced, he said, but "no cigar."
In his mid-30's, Mr. Corman turned one of his comic articles from Eye magazine into a full-length script and sent it to Simon & Schuster.
They accepted it, and, "Oh God," a satire about God's return to earth and his relationship with the press, was published in 1971. It grew into a major success when it was turned into the film starring George Burns and John Denver.
Before "Oh God" was released, Mr. Corman had completed "Kramer v. Kramer."
"When I finished the book, I thought I had done a good job, but I didn't have any idea of how far-reaching an impact it would or could have," he recalled. "It moved me from being a novelist who was a favorite with the underground media to a person people knew. It also ended my economic worries and meant I would not have to do educational films again."
In 1980, he published "The Old Neighborhood," a drama about a man who finds a haven in his childhood neighborhood when his marriage dissolves, and in 1987 he published "50," about a man who is coming to terms with aging.
Mr. Corman is now working on a comic novel in the spirit of "Oh God" and writing a screenplay with Diane Sokolow, a friend and colleague who also summers in the Hamptons.
"When I set out to do a novel," he said, "I like it to have some social significance. My main goal has always been to write books that get people thinking."

HEADLINE: World Markets;
Switzerland's Door Cracks Open

BYLINE: By Jonathan Fuerbringer

 BODY:
Switzerland's financial world is a rather exclusive place, still renowned for its secrecy. But it is starting to open up, partly in response to changes in stock markets throughout Europe and the world. In the process it is likely that foreign investors will get better treatment.
The prospect of these changes, analysts say, makes Switzerland's stock market an attractive long-term investment. The short-term outlook is more uncertain. 
 "Switzerland has had a protected market," said Donald Wilkinson, president of the Swiss Helvitia Fund, a closed-end mutual fund that invests in Swiss stocks. "Switzerland is a first-class, gold-plated economy with a third-world financial market."
By American standards, the changes do not seem particularly far-reaching. But for Switzerland they are quite radical.
More financial information will be disclosed. For example, Roche, the chemical and drug company, is moving to bring its financial reporting in line with the generally accepted accounting priciples in the United States.
There will also be more liquidity as the country's seven regional stock markets are pared down. By the end of this year, there should be only three markets left: Zurich, Geneva and Basel. And these three are planning a joint computerized trading system.
Beginning with Nestle in 1988, more companies have been opening their registered shares to foreign owners. Most Swiss companies have two or three kinds of shares. The registered shares generally sell at lower prices than the others and give holders more rights. Sandoz, the health-care products company, opened its registered shares to foreigners just last week.
In addition, changes are being discussed in the laws that limit foreign ownership of Swiss companies and in the way the stock exchanges are regulated.
The impending changes are positive, Mr. Wilkinson believes, but they will take time. So he takes the long-term view that investments in Switzerland should be given five years to pay off. That is longer than the Swiss Helvitia Fund has been around.
The Helvitia Fund is the easiest way for the average investor in the United States to get into the Swiss market. One advantage of the fund is that about 50 percent of its holdings are in registered shares.
But investors must remember that this is a closed-end fund, which means its stock price on the New York Stock Exchange is affected by two variables. One is the performance of the securities of the Swiss companies the fund owns. The other factor is the demand for the shares of the fund itself.
If this demand rises high enough, the fund's shares sell at a premium to the underlying value of the stocks in the fund. As the demand falls, the shares can sell at a discount. Buying shares at a premium opens the possibility of a fall in the stock price if interest in the fund wanes even though the prices of the stocks in the fund are stable or rising. The fund closed Friday at $12.875, a discount of 2.2 percent.
But despite the changes that cause analysts to endorse Switzerland as a long-term investment, some analysts hesitate about the immediate prospects.
"What will happen in the short term is difficult to say," said Felix Rovelli, vice president of Vontobel U.S.A. in New York, an affiliate of Bank J. Vontobel, a private Swiss bank. The stock market has already had a good run this year, with the Swiss Performance Index rising 19.2 percent.
One key issue is interest rates. The reports for February and March, which showed inflation rising about 6 percent in the previous year, were not encouraging, especially in the wake of a long period of high interest rates that have slowed the economy sharply. Some forecasters predict growth of just five-tenths of 1 percent this year.
This means the Swiss National Bank may move slowly in lowering interest rates further, said Malcolm A. Clinger Jr., the chief investment officer at the Swiss Bank Corporation in New York.
Still, Switzerland has a host of companies, like Roche, Sandoz, Ciba-Geigy and Nestle, that do much of their business outside of Switzerland and will benefit this year from the sudden rally in the dollar. Last week the dollar rose to 1.4682 Swiss francs, up 19 percent since its low in February.
Many of these companies had flat or declining earnings last year because of the fall of the dollar. Now analysts are projecting that Swiss companies will have percentage earnings increases this year in the mid-teens, and even this could improve if the dollar rises further.
Nevertheless, both Mr. Clinger and Mr. Rovelli also say Switzerland should be regarded as a long-term investment. The opening of the market in the next several years, they say, should combine with the advantages of Switzerland's many multinational companies to bring the investor returns worth the wait.
"We take the long-term perspective because we do not know when this market is going to open up," said Georges L. de Montebello, executive vice president of the Helvitia Fund. "Anyone who wants to make a quick buck should not invest in this market."

COMPANIES
 
Judging from the rally in banking stocks last week, it would appear that defaults and delinquencies are a receding worry. But not necessarily. Several banks, including Chase Manhattan and some regionals like First Fidelity, posted sharp gains in their first-quarter profits -- a product of cost-cutting, the slowing growth of bad loans and falling interest rates. Falling rates enable banks to make money on the spread between what they pay depositors and what they charge borrowers, whose rates are not adjusted as quickly. These spreads are now their widest in years, bankers say, because they need to earn more on their good customers to make up for all the bad ones. But these benefits didn't buttress all banks. Chemical Bank, NCNB and Manfacturers Hanover all saw earnings slip. And Citicorp suffered the most. Its profits plunged 70 percent in the first quarter, to a bare $70 million. While bad real estate loans were the bane of bankers early in the downturn, souring consumer loans are a worry as the recession matures. They were to blame for the disappointing quarter at Citicorp, the nation's largest issuer of credit cards and home mortgages. So why the stock rally? The earnings held none of the surprises -- dividend cuts and big additions to loan loss reserves -- that accompanied earlier quarters. 

Plastic Ills at American Express
Citicorp isn't the only issuer of plastic that has been sideswiped by rising unemployment, personal bankruptcies and consumer defaults. American Express said it would add $50 million to provisions to cover credit problems. Profits from its charge cards dropped 24.7 percent in the first quarter, to $162 million. Revenues also dipped, prompting a plan by American Express to lower the fees it charges restaurants that accept the card. For the quarter, American Express earned $264 million, saved by a recovery at its Shearson Lehman Brothers unit. A record loss at the brokerage had contributed to a loss of $620 million in the first quarter of 1990.
 
Almost as quickly as they invited Roseanne Barr into their living rooms, American television viewers have started to cast her out. The rating of her working folk's sitcom on ABC, "Roseanne," the top-rated series last year, fell 20 percent in the most recent season, which ended last Sunday. But this time, the hisses weren't for Roseanne alone. The ratings of most established shows drooped and for the first season in memory, no network added a real hit series. The creativity vacuum added to the continuing defection of viewers to cable and to Fox. While the networks' share of viewers slipped another 4 percentage points, to 62 percent, CBS's market share inched up. It still finished third among the networks for the fourth year running.

 In Brief
State insurance regulators seized control of the New York unit of the First Executive Corporation, whose largest unit was seized in California earlier this month.

Finally responding to cost-cutting, Sears, Roebuck was able to narrow its operating loss in the first quarter to $35 million, the most promising news in quarters.

Love That RJR Nabisco 'Junk'
What a difference a year makes. In January of 1990, RJR Nabisco withdrew a $1 billion "junk bond" offering because investors loathed leverage. But appetite was so strong for a scaled-down $750 million plan last week that RJR doubled the offer, which was the biggest for junk bonds since 1989. Still, investor interest was more a matter of RJR's success in slashing debt from its $25 billion leveraged buyout than any new love for leverage.
 
 
 
THE ECONOMY

 
Ready for the Rebound?
Could Alan Greenspan and the Fed be preparing for a rebound? Despite reports earlier this month indicating that inflation is in check, the Fed drained reserves from the banking system on Monday. That may be a sign that tightening credit and fighting inflation are higher priorities than lowering short-term interest rates to help speed a recovery.

Life After 3,000
Wall Street certainly warmed to the theory that the Fed is in its recovery mode. The Dow Jones industrial average broke the 3,000 barrier for the first time, a psychological milestone it had come close to three times since July. Spurred by lower interest rates here and abroad, stocks worldwide have rallied since the gulf-war chill last fall. That spells relief for Wall Street firms, whose first-quarter earnings were positively buoyant compared with last year, the worst year for securities firms in decades. But evidence that the economy has hit bottom is still shadowy, and institutional investors grabbed the chance to take profits while others rushed into the market on the coattails of the 3,000-mark euphoria. The market ended the week at 2,965.59

Reading the Trade Figures
The falling price of imported oil and the need for less of it in a recession helped narrow the trade deficit in February to its lowest level in more than seven years. The deficit, the amount by which purchases of foreign goods exceed sales abroad, dropped 26 percent, to $5.3 billion. But the trade figures don't necessarily bespeak an imminent recovery. Though imports dropped dramatically, exports, which had been a cushion in this recession, continued to slide from their December peak. The rising dollar and continued weakness of the country's trading partners are likely to reinforce the trend.

Gloomy Economic Statistics
The latest economic statistics are none too heartening. New claims for unemployment fell during the first week of April for the second week, but some economists discounted the fall because it came during the Easter holiday week. March figures give credence to a cautious view. Housing starts, after climbing in February, fell 9 percent in March, to 901,000. Industrial production fell by three-tenths of a percent. While that drop is the smallest of a string of decreases since October, it contributed to a decline in output of 9.25 percent for the first quarter, compared with one of only 7 percent in the final 1990 quarter. "The numbers are very dismal," said Lacy H. Hunt of the Hongkong Bank Group. "Without question, they show the recession is continuing and the recovery is nowhere in sight."

Forget that Blue-Plate Special
Peanut butter or meatloaf are no longer meals fit for a recession. A drought in the Southeast caused peanut prices to double last fall, prompting peanut butter makers to plead for an end to an import ban, a move the Administration is now mulling. A 30-year low in the nation's cattle herd, which shrank during a drought three years ago, has translated into a 6 percent rise in ground-beef prices in a year.
 
 
 
INTERNATIONAL

 
Gorbachev Comes A'Calling
Mikhail S. Gorbachev sees Japan as a sort of kindred spirit. The Soviet economy, he told his Japanese comrades during a visit to Tokyo last week -- the first by a Soviet leader -- is akin to Japan's in 1945. Its industrial base, in shambles, is far better at making weapons than widgets. But oh, how Japan's billions could transform its ravaged landscape. The Soviets, he offered, were ready to convert military plants to jet-making factories and to set up auto and oil joint ventures with Japan. But Japanese officials sent the Soviet leader packing and suggested he first tend to political unrest and pick up the pace of the transition to a market economy at home. Mr. Gorbachev didn't leave entirely empty-handed. In his clutch was the bargaining chip he came with, the Kurile Islands.

 Maxwell to Hit the Market
Robert Maxwell is looking to the public to finance his spending spree. He hopes to raise up to $445.6 million by selling as much as 49 percent of his Mirror Group in the British stock market. The offering could help reduce the newspaper company's debt of more than $1 billion and perhaps enable it to buy the non-British papers Mr. Maxwell owns, which include the The New York Daily News.

A Ticker for Poland?
Market technicians donned the white shirts and red suspenders popular among some male traders on Wall Street. But the look of sophistication and know-how surrounding the opening day of Poland's stock exchange, which resumed trading after a silence of 50 years, defied a fundamental deficiency of the system. The market certainly represents a huge step forward for capitalism in East Europe, promising to provide a vehicle for financing the hundreds of Government entities that are soon expected to be privatized. If only there were capital to spare in Poland. Shares of five state-run ventures, recently privatized, were available for trading. But only a few thousand shares traded hands.

Americans Aim To Speak in Many Other Tongues

BYLINE: By CLAUDIA H. DEUTSCH

 BODY:
Market research told the Ryko Manufacturing Company that selling its car wash equipment in France would be a breeze. But when it tried, potential buyers resisted mightily -- and for a good reason. Ryko's instruction manuals were in English, a language that few car wash operators could read.
So Ryko translated its manual into French, and 1991 sales took off. "Operating in local languages has become a necessary part of competing overseas," said Barbara Wilson, international administrative assistant for the Grimes, Iowa, company. 
 No one has hard numbers to prove it, but language experts insist that more American companies are reaching that conclusion. "The demand may not be a gusher yet, but it is a lot steadier than a trickle or a drip," said Bernard Bierman, editor of Translation News, an industry newsletter.
 All of this is wonderful news for the 4,500 members of the American Translators Association, as well as linguistically talented students who may want to join the profession.
"Our graduates no longer have to go to Europe to find good jobs," said Margarita B. Bowen, head of the division of interpretation and translation at Georgetown University's School of Languages and Linguistics.
Peter Priest, who heads a Russian translation program for engineering students at the Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology in Terre Haute, Ind., has noticed that "Corporate recruiters who used to only care about our students' engineering skills increasingly ask about their translation abilities."
There are many reasons for the upsurge:
* More strategic alliances with foreign companies. "American companies do not want a foreign partner's translation of a contract to be the operating document," said Marilyn Miller, president of Language Services International, a Des Moines translation agency whose volume of corporate assignments has doubled annually for three years.
* The opening up of Eastern Europe to foreign commerce. "Eastern Europeans have no point of reference for phrases like 'stock exchange' or 'leveraged buyout,' so the translations have to be done here," said Ronald J. Patten, dean of DePaul University's College of Commerce.
* More innovation, particularly in pharmaceuticals. "Intensified competition has yielded more research, more patents, and more multinational lawsuits -- all of which means more translations," said Peter C. Richardson, general patent counsel of Pfizer Inc. Anne Saxon, a New York interpreter of Italian, adds that pharmaceutical companies are holding more international teleconferences, requiring oral interpretations of speakers.
* The increased flow of immigrants and tourists to the United States. Spanish-language translators report more assignments to translate textbooks, bill inserts, advertising and other material from English into Spanish, for the benefit of the rapidly growing Hispanic population. American hotels, travel agents and restaurants are translating brochures, menus and such from English into Japanese, German and other languages spoken in thriving economies.
* Increased clamor from overseas distributors of American products for materials in their own languages. Amana Refrigeration Inc., for one, just translated user manuals for its major appliances into Greek and Hebrew, at the request of distributors in Greece and Israel. It is now doing one in Portugese, for its distributor in Portugal. "They say they can sell our product more readily if we stop assuming that everyone speaks English," said Brian K. Parrott, who supervises the production of Amana's customer literature.
Fisher Controls, the instrumentation subsidiary of the Monsanto Company, even wants to match dialects. For its European customers, it has customer training guides in French, Spanish and Portugese. Now it is tailoring those guides to match the way Spanish and Portugese are spoken, respectively, in Columbia and Brazil. "We want to accommodate any culture that uses our equipment," said Joseph M. Morris, a marketing manager in Fisher's education department.
Of course, not all translations are done in the United States. Fisher, and other companies looking for local nuances, generally turn to translators in the country they have targeted. Companies listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange generally have their annual reports translated into Japanese in Tokyo. And companies often let their own overseas offices translate brochures.
"The products we sell overseas, we make overseas, so doing the translations here doesn't make sense," said John Cox, a senior vice president at Avon Products Inc.
Maybe not -- but foreign translators can massacre idioms. One American company just asked Louis Korda, a Hungarian translator in New York, to retranslate several documents. "They got nervous when the Hungarians translated 'blue chip company' as 'maker of blue chips,' " Mr. Korda said.
 
 
 
TRANSLATORS AND ANTITRUST
 Four years ago, the American Translators Association, rankled that its members often got paid just a few hundred dollars for translating complicated documents, began publishing annual guidelines for what translators should charge.
The Federal Trade Commission was not amused. It is investigating whether the practice constitutes price-fixing.
Frank Patton Jr., a New York lawyer representing the association, says that in January his client provided the F.T.C. with the documents it requested and has heard nothing further. But the group is taking no chances on an unfavorable ruling. It has adopted a "specific and defined and tough policy to comply with antitrust requirements," Mr. Patton said. Thus, the 1990 fee recommendations -- $95 per 1,000 words for nontechnical translation, $105 for technical translations -- will be the last.
The F.T.C. would not discuss the case.

When Bonds Act Like Stocks

BYLINE: By CAROLE GOULD

 BODY:
Junk-bond funds behave very differently from their cousins that invest in higher-grade bonds. Returns on high-quality bond funds, which are very sensitive to shifts in interest rates, tend to rise when the economy is in a recession and as interest rates drop -- exactly when junk-bond funds are most vulnerable to a decline.
In fact, junk bonds have lately been behaving more like stocks than bonds. When stock-fund returns fell last year, the returns on junk-bond funds -- the sum of yield plus price change -- also dropped, after a slight lag. When the stock funds began to rally at the end of last year, the returns on junk funds advanced too. 
 The lesson for investors: take this stock-like behavior into account, because price movements on junk-bond funds "may be more than a typical fixed-income investor bargains for," said Stephen A. Schoepke, an analyst with Lipper Analytical Services in Summit, N.J.

HEADLINE: Three R's for the Middle East

BYLINE: By Zbigniew Brzezinski; Zbigniew Brzezinski was national security adviser in the Carter Administration.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
Though I still think that punitive sanctions would have better served America's long-term interests, clearly the military victory over Iraq was easier than expected. However, there is a growing -- but still avoidable -- risk that the war may come to be seen as having precipitated a geopolitical disaster and a moral disgrace.
The increasingly messy aftermath of the war gives rise to two central questions: What are the principal benefits and debits of our triumph? What are the immediate and longer-range implications for subsequent U.S. policy? 
 The benefits are undeniably impressive. First, a blatant act of aggression was rebuffed and punished. An important political and even legal point, central to international decency, was reaffirmed: that the community of nations will not tolerate the brutal use of force by one state against another.
Second, U.S. military power is henceforth likely to be taken more seriously. The technological and strategic virtuosity of the U.S. military performance, as well as the display of personal determination by U.S. decision-makers, is bound to have a chilling effect even as far away as North Korea, a dictatorship reputed to be acquiring nuclear weapons of its own.
Third, the Middle East and Persian Gulf region is now clearly an American sphere of preponderance. Pro-American Arab regimes feel more secure; so does Israel. U.S. access to oil is now not in jeopardy.
Fourth, the Soviet Union, until recently America's principal rival in the Middle East, to all intents and purpose has now been reduced largely to the status of a spectator.
However, some negative consequences must also be placed on the scales. First, the most immediate regional beneficiary of Iraq's downfall has been Iran, a power openly hostile to the U.S. and to America's satellite regimes on the Arabian Peninsula. America's military presence in the region is now imperative. This is not necessarily inimical to U.S. interests, but potentially is a source of new instabilities.
Second, that presence is related to the growing danger that the war's aftermath is intensifying the region's barely suppressed ethnic, religious and tribal animosities. The war against Iraq could become part of a prolonged chain reaction, eventually "Lebanonizing" the region as a whole while bogging the U.S. down in it.
Third, the very intensity of the air assault on Iraq gives rise to concern that the conduct of the war may come to be seen as evidence that Americans view Arab lives as worthless.
The last consideration raises sensitive moral issues. The war was presented to the public as a "just war," made necessary both by the immorality of Saddam Hussein's action and by the scale of the threat he posed. He was portrayed as if he were another Hitler, menacing the whole world. In fact, he turned out to have been much more like Mussolini.
 And that raises the moral question of the proportionality of response. U.S. spokesmen repeatedly stated that the objective was not the destruction of Iraq and that the enemy was Mr. Hussein and not the Iraqi people. However, the air assault against Iraq was heavily directed, doubtless for military reasons, at its ability to operate as a modern society, with adverse consequences for the well-being of innocent people.
This conclusion emerges starkly from the report submitted to the U.N. by the Finnish head of a special investigative mission, Marti Ahtissari. It itemizes the destruction of nonmilitary targets. Some 90 percent of the industrial labor force has been deprived of work and income; the country's "sole laboratory producing veterinary vaccines" was destroyed by bombing; so were its "seed warehouses," with "all stocks of potatoes and vegetable seeds," thereby placing in jeopardy seasonal planting. Because of the deliberate destruction of power plants and other sources of energy, "all electrically operated installations have ceased to function," causing a shortage of water and forcing the population to rely on contaminated water supply. "All modern communications systems have been destroyed," etc.
The mission concluded that the population faced "a catastrophe" from epidemics and undernourishment, unless relief was forthcoming.
The human misery produced by the war has subsequently been compounded by the abortive Shiite and Kurdish revolts. Obviously (though naively) counting on American support, the uprisings have been repressed with massive force and brutality. The resulting flight of the Kurds then created further suffering, with the Kurds subjected to deaths and deprivations on a shocking scale.
All this is relevant to any calculus of the war's benefits and debits. It raises the possibility that the war may have been a classical case of an under-reaction to earlier signs of Mr. Hussein's aggressiveness that later prompted an over-reaction to the eventual act of aggression. This over-reaction may have prompted what might be deemed in moral terminology a "disproportionate" response.
It is important to raise this troubling issue, especially given the emphasis on the idea of the "just war" and the deliberate evocation of Churchillian symbols and rhetoric to gain public support. The fact is the war was not waged against all odds, against an all-powerful opponent -- as had been the case against Hitler -- but it pitted the world's only superpower against a third world country armed with second-best weapons.
What task should the U.S. now shoulder, bearing morality and geopolitics in mind? The point of departure for any answer must be the recognition that the U.S. now has unprecedented influence on the fate of an entire region.
After World War II, Harry S. Truman recognized America's moral and political responsibility for the future of Europe. He rose to that challenge through a firm commitment to large-scale relief, reconstruction and reconciliation. Today, the Persian Gulf and Middle East needs all three. Relief must be undertaken on a massive scale: for the Kurds in the first place, for the Shiites and for other Iraqis as well.
The dispatching of U.S. forces to shield encampments in Iraq for the displaced Kurds is a right step, but it is difficult to understand how U.S. forces can vacate the occupied parts of southern Iraq without first obtaining a firm commitment from Baghdad to alter the political status of the Iraqi Kurds very significantly.
Beyond this immediate -- partly moral and partly political -- imperative, it behooves the U.S. to pursue actively three broad goals: a regional security arrangement, a process for the redistribution of regional wealth and for enhanced economic cooperation among all the region's states (including Israel) and a serious movement toward Arab-Israeli peace.
Fortunately, there are signs the U.S. is moving in that direction. But to succeed it will have to pursue all three goals together. There can be no regional security, including arms control and other arrangements to minimize a repetition of the Iraqi aggression, without some progress on the other two central issues. And there can be no movement on Israeli-Arab peace, including eventually some form of statehood for the Palestinians, without a wider accommodation that tackles the region's strategic and social vulnerability.
President Truman recognized the challenge of relief, reconstruction and reconciliation. America rose to the challenge. That is why Europe is safe and healthy today. For geopolitical and moral reasons, America should undertake no less in the Middle East.

HEADLINE: Boom in Manufactured Exports Provides Hope for U.S. Economy

BYLINE: By SYLVIA NASAR

 BODY:
In a quiet revolution, the United States, long derided as an industrial has-been, has become one of the world's low-cost manufacturers -- lower in many industries than Canada, Europe and Japan.
American factories now ship steel to Seoul, transistors to Tokyo, cars to Cologne and bicycle pants to Bologna. Exports ranging from beer and boards to carpets and computer chips have surged by 76 percent since 1986. At home, domestically made machine tools, electronics gear and cars -- some turned out in factories with foreign owners -- are muscling aside imports. 
 As a result, foreign trade is likely to power the economy for years to come. "Export-led growth may be the only feasible strategy for the United States," said C. Fred Bergsten, director of the Institute for International Economics in Washington. Indeed, the shrinking trade deficit, now at a seven-year low, is offsetting some of spending lost in the recession.
 
Growth May Continue
 Though exports have lately leveled off as growth overseas has slowed, forecasters at DRI/McGraw-Hill expect exports to grow 50 percent faster than imports during the rest of the 1990's.
What is behind the resurgence of American cost-competitiveness? Partly, of course, it is the dollar, high-flying in the mid-80's, returned to earth. Despite the dollar's recent bounce, its value is still a third below its 1985 level.
More enduring are the sweeping and painful changes undertaken by American managers and workers, which have revived flagging factory productivity. These changes have ended some of the worst excesses of the 70's, including pay increases that helped to price many United States products out of overseas markets while encouraging lower-priced imports.
For decades, American companies acted as though higher costs could always be passed on. The new attitude is captured by companies like the Cross & Trecker Corporation, a maker of machine tools based in Bloomfield Hills, Mich., which intends to cut the cost of its products by 5 percent a year.
How durable are the American gains? Certainly, an unexpected return to an overvalued dollar would wipe them out. So would slipping back into the sloppy habits of the past.
And low costs by themselves cannot guarantee global competitiveness in a world of increasingly well-heeled, choosy customers who, more often than not, care as much about quality, style, service and technical razzle-dazzle as they do about price. Buyers -- domestic and foreign -- are not likely to abandon superbly engineered German machine tools or reliable Japanese cars for cheaper but shoddier alternatives.
 
Beyond Burgers and Junk Bonds
 Those who still think of the United States as a good place to make burgers, "junk bonds" and Boeing aircraft, and little else, ignore a vast terrain friendly to the manufacture of old-fashioned goods like nails and light bulbs.
Illinois Tool Works Inc., based in Glenview, Ill., recently scrapped its plans to build another nail factory in Germany. And Osram Inc., a subsidiary of Siemens A.G., the German electronics giant, recently poured $3 million into a plant in Maybrook, N.Y., that produces light bulbs and auto headlamps.
These decisions partly reflect the favorable American manufacturing climate. In Illinois Tool's case, it costs the company about 20 percent more to make a nail in Germany than in the United States and twice as much to add capacity in Germany. Not only are bricks and mortar more expensive there, but companies are required to take on more commitments, in benefits and job guarantees, for their workers.
"We can produce nails here with less overhead and fewer social costs," said W. James Farrell, an executive vice president of Illinois Tool.
In Osram's case, most customers are in the United States, but the company expects to ship about a fifth of its products to European and Asian auto makers. "From an efficiency standpoint, we stack up very well to our German counterparts, sometimes to their surprise," said Paul Caramagna, Osrams' vice president.
 
Costs Lower in U.S.
 Though none should be taken literally, broad statistical yardsticks tell the same story. Estimates by Peter Hooper and Karen Larin, economists at the Federal Reserve in Washington, suggest that unit costs in the United States are 60 percent of those in Germany and 80 percent of those in Japan. DRI/McGraw-Hill, using different data and methods, estimates that American factory costs are about 10 percent below those of Europe and Japan.
And the United States is almost certainly among the lowest-cost producers of basic commodities. Take the raw material for those ubiquitous plastic detergent bottles with hourglass shapes. It costs 25 percent less to produce high-density polyethylene pellets in the United States than in Europe, and 15 percent less than in Japan, according to Chem Systems, a consulting firm in Tarrytown, N.Y. Back in 1985, when the dollar peaked, costs in the United States were no lower than in Europe and Japan.
The United States can make steel more cheaply than Germany or Japan, although Britain can make it more cheaply yet. Indeed, USS-Posco Industries now makes money shipping 5 percent to 10 percent of the cold-rolled steel from its plant in Pittsburg, Calif., to the Pacific Rim. The average cost of producing a ton of steel in the United States is now about $535, as against $542 in Germany and $614 in Japan, according to the WEFA Group, an economics consulting firm in Bala-Cynwyd, Pa.
 
Paneling Tailored to Japanese
 Another successful export to the Pacific -- specifically to Japan -- is boards, by the boatload. The Louisiana-Pacific Corporation, based in Portland, Ore., exports so much wood to Japan these days that it is making, in addition to its standard 4-by-8-foot paneling, a 3-by-6-foot version that the Japanese prefer. "Our costs are very competitive with Canada and Scandinavia," said Barry Lacter, the company's vice president for public relations.
The United States also seems to have regained ground in industries that many people had written off. American textile mills, it turns out, are very competitive in products for industry and the home. Judging by exports last year, Greeks like to sleep between American designer sheets and Saudis prefer to walk on American wall-to-wall shag carpets in their homes.
The new cost competitiveness varies from product to product, but what is striking is the huge across-the-board swing since the mid-80's. Indeed, the United States is even more competitive in manufacturing costs than it was in the late 70's, when its trade in factory goods was balanced and exports were booming.
 
Low Dollar Worked Wonders
 Consider how the dollar helped to create the shift. The dollar's value against other currencies is back where it was in the late 70's and early 80's. Even after a recent surge against the German mark and the Japanese yen, the dollar is worth about what it was last spring and about 30 percent less than in February 1985.
The lower dollar has done wonders for American industry, particularly machine tools. Exports last year jumped 23 percent while imports sank 5 percent. "The primary reason for that significant swing is manufacturing costs," said Norman J. Ryker, chief executive of Cross & Trecker. The company has recently expanded its sales force in Germany and Japan to sell its top export, the Sheffield machine, which is used to measure machined parts precisely.
At the same time, Cross & Trecker, which used to import some smaller tools from Japan, has not done so in six months. "It costs too much," Mr. Ryker said.
American factory productivity -- which has remained the highest in the world -- has been jack-rabbiting along in the 80's. Rising at an average rate of 3.6 percent a year, output per hour in American factories has been advancing faster than in the 60's and nearly three times as fast as in the 70's.
Efficiency gains in the American auto industry rose about 4 percent a year in the 1980's, thanks partly to the Japanese companies that build cars in United States plants known as transplants. "The transplants are close in efficiency to the best plants in Japan, and many Ford plants are as efficient as the transplants," said James P. Womack, an automotive expert at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. These days, Detroit is sending American-made models around the world.
Not all of the productivity gains resulted from shutting inefficient plants or slashing payrolls. Some reflect efforts to do things right the first time, an effort that almost by definition bolsters output per worker.
Take Motorola Inc., the nation's largest maker of computer chips, which has raised its productivity in part by reducing costly defects. After an intense five-year campaign, Motorola now measures defects in its popular microcontrollers -- chips that show up in everything from cameras to cars -- not in percentage points, but in parts per million.
"Our goal for mistakes is 3.4 parts per million -- not just in the products themselves, but in sales and service," said Kenneth C. Phillips, a company spokesman.
More than half of Motorola's sales in 1990 were overseas. That is one reason, no doubt, that the United States recorded a trade surplus in semiconductors last year, after years of deficits.
Finally, United States manufacturing workers are no longer the world's fat cats in terms of pay and benefits. At current exchange rates, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, Americans earn $14.31 an hour in pay and benefits. German workers, in comparison, earn $17.58. In Japan, where pay has more than doubled in dollar terms since 1979, workers now earn the equivalent of $12.63 an hour.
Thus, part of the price of greater American competitiveness has been paid by American factory workers. Their purchasing power has been squeezed as blue-collar pay rose at a slower pace in the United States than almost anywhere else.

HEADLINE: Future in Mind, Choctaws Reject Plan for Landfill

BYLINE: By RONALD SMOTHERS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PHILADELPHIA, Miss., April 20

 BODY:
Invoking a sense of mystery about the land that has been their home for generations and expressing concern for future generations, the Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians has rejected a proposal to develop a hazardous-waste landfill near its reservation.
"We are close to the land and if you hurt the land it will come back to haunt you," said Carmen Denson, a member of the tribal council. Mr. Denson was among the opponents of the plan, which had sharply divided the 5,000-member tribe. 
 On Friday by a vote of 786 to 525, the Choctaws rejected the proposal to allow disposal of manufacturing waste products, including oils, cleaning solvents and other chemicals, on land nearby to be developed as a landfill. The developer said the plan could have meant as much as $30 million a year in payments to the tribe.
 
Some Are Troubled
 The proposal was the latest development in what many see as a troubling trend in the last two years of waste companies approaching Indian groups with proposals to use their lands to dump or incinerate waste.
Because of tribal sovereignty, Indian land is subject only to Federal regulation and is immune from the generally stricter state and local regulations, including taxation.
There is a growing environmental movement among Indians who see the proposals coming before tribal councils as attempts by waste companies to use sovereignty to evade stricter regulation.
George Farris, director of the environmental services division of the Bureau of Indian Affairs, said that there were no waste sites on Indian land yet, but that there were five proposals from among the 300 tribal councils nationally. Those included the proposal just rejected by the Choctaws, a plan that had advanced to the point of becoming a formal application and contract requiring the bureau's approval. Mr. Farris said the number of such proposals under discussion was decreasing.
For Odie Jim, 63 years old, the concern was not the national trend but what could happen to the land that his ancestors had doggedly held on to while most Choctaws were being driven to reservations in Oklahoma in the last century. Mr. Jim credited the tribe's ability to hold on to its language and much of its culture through the years to the members' succeeding in maintaining their connection to the land.
 
'Young Ones Will Have Nothing'
 "What if something happens to the landfill, like a leak and damage, and the tribe is sued and we lose the land," he said. "We, the old ones and the elderlies have to do the right thing for the young ones. If they sue us and we have no money, they will take the whole reservation and the young ones will have nothing."
Such views proved pivotal in the tribal referendum on the plan to go into business with a Jackson, Miss., company, National Disposal Services Inc.
But perhaps the most important message emerging from the voting on the 23,000-acre reservation near here, said Linda Farve, a leading opponent of the plan, is that people "will see that we are not easy prey for the waste companies and that we will speak out."
Lance Hughes, a Cherokee and executive director of Native Americans for a Clean Environment, said tribes around the country had felt pressure from proposals like the one here.
"We already have tremendous environmental problems on the reservations with deforestation, energy exploitation and other things," Mr. Hughes said, "and now they are trying to bring the waste products of all these processes back to us with the promise that we will make some money."
From the Dakotas to the Rio Grande, from Southern California to eastern Mississippi, there have been 36 proposals in the last two years to develop landfills or incinerators on Indian lands, Mr. Hughes said, citing surveys by his organization. Most such plans have been rejected by the tribes, while others are still under discussion.
 
Race-Related Concerns
 Mr. Hughes and other opponents of such plans see them as part of the phenomenon they call "toxic racism," for the tendency they see of environmentally hazardous dumps or landfills being located in communities that are poor, politically powerless and that frequently have large minority communities.
Concerns in the matter are being voiced, as well, by some industry groups.
Richard Fortuna, executive director of the Hazardous Waste Treatment Council, which is based in Washington, said that, for the most part, experienced and reputable companies had sought out Indian tribes and that their motivation was to avoid the political uncertainty of the process of getting approval from state, county or municipal officials. He said the purpose was not to avoid stricter state and local regulations.
The developments have also attracted attention in Congress, including that of Senator Thomas Daschle, Democrat of South Dakota. A spokesman for Mr. Daschle, a member of the Senate Select Committee on Indian Affairs, said the Senator had asked environmental committees currently considering reauthorization of major environmental legislation to consider regulating such sites on Indian land. The issue is scheduled to be taken up in hearings in the next few months.
The proposal here called for the waste company to operate the landfill for the tribe. The agreement called for an initial payment of nearly $500,000 to the tribe, a 10 percent share of the landfill's annual revenue and creation of more than 200 jobs. Estimates of potential earnings for the tribe ranged from $10 million to $30 million a year.
 The outcome of the referendum was a rare defeat for the Mississippi Choctaws' longtime chief, Phillip Martin, who has supported aggressive economic development efforts over the years. Mr. Martin oversees Indian manufacturing enterprises that employ 1,200 people and bring in an estimated $60 million in annual sales. He had pushed the landfill proposal through the tribal council last July, but last month, amid growing opposition, agreed to the referendum.
 
Questions About Conflicts
 The proposed venture with National Disposals Systems, a new company, had raised several serious questions.
Wilson Carroll, the assistant State Attorney General in charge of environmental issues, noted that the venture involved a proposal that the tribe buy 466 acres owned by the company in Noxubee County, near the reservation. Once the tribe acquired the land and placed it in trust, giving it immunity from local regulation, the land would be leased back to National Disposal Systems for development of the landfill. Mr. Carroll said that, among other things, the state was disturbed at the possibility of the Choctaws regulating the landfill while also benefiting from it.
Noxubee County is one of several eastern Mississippi and western Alabama areas considered particularly well-suited geologically for landfills. They stand on a thick layer of nearly impervious Selma clay, which is thought to be one of the best insulators for such developments.
The area is home to the nation's largest hazardous waste dump, at Emelle, Ala., just across the state line from Noxubee County. Two other companies have proposed hazardous waste dumps in the county, Mr. Carroll said.

HEADLINE: Florio and a Klan Leader Trade Accusations

BYLINE: By JOSEPH F. SULLIVAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: NEWARK, April 19

 BODY:
In the wake of recruiting efforts by the Ku Klux Klan this month, Gov. Jim Florio has attacked the organization, not only for its white supremacist doctrines but also for its attempt to use the state's economic problems and his tax and gun control policies to win converts.
"We're in a national recession and when economic times are hard, we always see an upswing in bigotry and intolerance," Mr. Florio told a gathering of local religious and civil rights leaders and residents at the Temple Beth Ohr in Old Bridge on Wednesday.
 
 "Some people need to find someone to blame, it seems," he said. The Governor called the Klan members "apostles of hate" and said they were not welcome in New Jersey.
 Richard Fogel, the leader of the Invisible Empire, Knights of the Ku Klux Klan for Pennsylvania, New Jersey and Delaware, said in a telephone interview that he was stung by the Governor's remarks, calling them "derogatory and antidemocratic.
"The Constitution guarantees our freedom of association and the right to say what we think," he said. Mr. Fogel called Mr. Florio's passage of a $2.8 billion tax program "almost dictatorial" and said his support of legislation banning assault rifles had "raised the ire" of gun enthusiasts.
"He is forgetting the real people, the dispossessed majority and listening to the special interests and organized minorities," Mr. Fogel said. Robed and hooded Klansmen carried that message when they handed out leaflets and Klan newspapers containing racial slurs in Gloucester City earlier this month. In addition, other followers of Mr. Fogel placed Klan business cards in mailboxes or taped them to store windows in Old Bridge.
Mr. Florio, who has embarked on a busy public schedule highlighting the benefits of his economic program to counter a lingering public antipathy to his programs before November's legislative elections, found a warm reception for his attack on the Klan and for his appeal for racial harmony at the temple on Wednesday.
Jon Shure, Mr. Florio's communications director, said some people think it would have been better to ignore the recruiting attempts. "They say these are small incidents, why give them publicity, but we think the publicity hurts them rather than helps them," he said. "If we don't speak up, then this type of activity has the darkness it needs to flourish."
According to a recent report by the Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith, the Klan has about 50 members in New Jersey. Pennsylvania has the largest and most active Klan membership of any Northeast state, with 250 and 300 members, the report said.
Mr. Florio last year signed legislation that made racial and ethnic intimidation crimes a felony. In 1990 there were 824 complaints of crimes related to race, religion and ethnic origin, an increase of 36 percent from 1989.
In December the state police and office of Middlesex County Prosecutor Alan A. Rockoff arrested five people, identified as skinhead-Klansmen in Middlesex and Somerset Counties, on charges of illegal purchase and possession of semiautomatic weapons and handguns.
In the same month, the state police arrested three people including Joseph Doak of Clayton, the Grand Dragon of the state's chapter of the Invisible Empire, on charges of conspiring to inflict serious bodily harm on rivals in the group.
Among the businesses on whose windows the Klan members taped business cards was East Coast Custom, a silk-screening and printing shop run by Daisy Pendleton and two of her sons, Pat and Ben. The Pendletons, who are black, said the cards reminded them of 1974 when a cross was burned on the lawn of their home in Spotswood.
The Pendletons, who were among the first black families in their neighborhood, still live in the same house. They said they were saddened and angered but not intimidated by the Klan business cards. Ben Pendleton designed a T-shirt depicting a hooded Klansman inside an international stop sign and the words "Klan Buster."
"It'll never change," Mrs. Pendleton said. "It's not fair. We're just people trying to make a living."

HEADLINE: After 40 Years, Racially Split Schools Are a Legacy of One Southern Town

BYLINE: By PETER APPLEBOME, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SUMMERTON, S.C.

 BODY:
The old whites-only high school is now an abandoned red brick hulk, but its ghosts still whisper and breathe, part of the indelible sense of race and turf that pervades this town where one of the most critical legal challenges to segregation began more than 40 years ago.
"I remember my husband standing out by the steps there and telling Thurgood Marshall, 'You'll never get us to integrate,' " said Marjorie Davis, a white woman whose children were in school during the challenge to segregation. "He said, 'We'll just abandon the schools.' And we did. The whites left and they never came back." 
 A recent television miniseries, "Separate but Equal," focused on Summerton's past as the site of one of five lawsuits that resulted in the Brown v. Board of Education ruling by the Supreme Court, outlawing segregation.
Four decades later, the invisible lines that divide the races still suffuse almost every aspect of life. The public schools that blacks sought to desegregate are now virtually all black. Economic and political power remains firmly in the hands of white residents, although they are overwhelmingly outnumbered by blacks.
In some ways, Summerton, with a population now below 1,000, is a special case, where the town's role in the racial history of the South has created a sort of stalemate that drags down both whites and blacks.
 
Reminder of Unchanged Times
 But in its daily life in churches and schools, in the decision of whites to eat at the Summerton Diner or blacks at the Sunshine Restaurant, in the artful social choreography that went into the staging of a town variety show not long ago, it is something far more universal. It is a reminder of how much remains utterly unchanged, not just here but in thousands of small towns throughout the South since the Brown decision on May 17, 1954.
"Like one of the Supreme Court Justices said, 'Some things you're not going to change,' " said June Ross, who owns a small bakery and delicatessen on Summerton's Main Street. "We've made a lot of progress, but there's a strain of Southern gentility that will never change."
Summerton's foray into history began in 1947, when black citizens organized by a preacher, J. A. Delaine, asked the all-white school board for help in operating a bus, so blacks, like whites, could ride in buses to their segregated schools.
When they were turned down, they went to court. In their lawsuit, named for Harry Briggs, a black mechanic who was one of the plaintiffs, and Roderick W. Elliott, the board president, the blacks asked not just for bus service but also for school buildings, services and education equal to those of whites. Argued by Thurgood Marshall, now a Supreme Court Justice, Briggs v. Elliott became one of five suits that were combined in the Brown decision.
 
An Easy Surface Sociability
 Since then, some things have changed here. Whites and blacks coexist with an easy surface sociability that is far more amicable than can be found in many Northern cities. But to many people, what has not changed is at least as significant as what has.
"The Supreme Court ruling had no effect on Summerton, then or now," said James Washington, president of the Clarendon County chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People. "When the decision came down, black people were jubilant. Pretty soon though, we realized that nothing had changed."
Summerton's schools reflect the slow, halting progression of desegregation in many Southern towns. In the early 1950's, the district built new schools, to provide what were said to be equal accommodations for blacks and whites. Despite the 1954 ruling, blacks and whites maintained those separate schools for more than a decade, until 1965. Then the district adopted a plan that allowed whites and blacks to choose which school they would attend. Four blacks attended white schools in 1965.
 
Neighboring Town Integrates
 Many whites deserted the district right away, setting up Clarendon Hall, a whites-only private school that still educates most whites in town. The rest left soon after. In 1969, there were 281 white students in the district. A year later, when desegregation began in earnest, there were 16. Before long, there were none. Of the 1,274 students in Summerton's public schools this year, 23 are white.
Summerton's problems seem particularly acute in contrast to schools in the county seat, Manning, 10 miles away, where the schools have successfully integrated and white enrollment has increased in recent years. Indeed, some whites there are from the Summerton district, taking advantage of various loopholes to cross district lines. But Manning has a stronger economic base and a less antagonistic racial history.
As whites left the three schools in the Summerton district, the town's commitment to the schools dwindled. The high school, Scotts Branch High, has some modern equipment like a small robotics laboratory and some dedicated teachers like Ophelia Darby. Using an $800 annual budget and old instruments that barely function, she has built a band that was invited to play at an African-American festival in Philadelphia this spring. But the physical plant is dilapidated and hopelessly out of date.
 
Belief in a Legacy
 "The building needs to be replaced," said B. J. Caldwell, a black woman who is the high school principal, "but there's no tax base here. And the attitude in general seems to be that the building is good enough for them."
Many blacks believe that the town's stagnation is partly a perverse legacy of the school lawsuit.
"I don't think the people who have power care if it gets any better here," said Mr. Washington of the N.A.A.C.P. "It's like they feel, 'You pulled this on us 20 years ago, and so we're going to keep you down as much as we can.' "
Most people in town realize that Summerton may never prosper unless its schools do. The schools are not producing the educated work force needed to attract employers, but without an added economic base, it will be difficult to improve the schools.
The superintendent, Milton Marley, who is white, said many younger whites would like to improve the schools. "There's a cadre of younger people in the community who are trying to get involved in redevelopment," he said, "but it's a long process."
The young whites find themselves facing the same choice their parents did 35 years ago: Do they want their children to be a small minority in an overwhelmingly black district, and one that is clearly substandard? Most make the same decision their parents did and send their children elsewhere.
 
Brief Feeling of Good Cheer
 For two nights recently, Summerton did come back to life. In a event awash in nostalgia and good cheer, the gymnasium of the shuttered white high school was reopened for the Stars of Summerton, a variety show to raise money for downtown revitalization.
Fox Tindal did his animal imitations; some of the leading men in town donned pink tights and tutus for a ballet skit, and others performed acts, some serious, on an old-timey stage set adorned with the slogan, "Here's to Good Old Summerton."
Blacks as well as whites performed, but the high school entertainment came from the Manning High School Choir, not from the Scotts Branch High band. And despite the hopes of some organizers that it would be otherwise, the audience was virtually all white.
Just as the abandoned school is still viewed as the territory of whites, the fact that whites planned the event and staged it at the old white school defined it for blacks.
"There is no trust between the races," said Ms. Caldwell, the high school principal. "There's automatic suspicion when whites are in charge of anything. It's sad, but it's true."

HEADLINE: Studying Bush Plan, 2 Schools Back It for Different Reasons

BYLINE: By JOSEPH BERGER

 BODY:
Public School 51 and the Holy Cross School are just four blocks apart on the dreary fringes of Times Square. Many of their students are impoverished, and they speak a babel of foreign languages.
When President Bush proposed on Thursday that parents be allowed to send their children to schools of their choice and that Federal funds for remedial programs should follow them, some observers noted that the flow of students and money will most likely be in one direction -- from public schools like P.S. 51 to parochial ones like Holy Cross. That may be true. Nonetheless, the leaders of both schools welcome the chance to compete.
 
Concern Over Funds
 "It is our job," said the principal of P.S. 51, John Economides, "to make our school so attractive that parents will not be going to private or parochial schools." 
 Mr. Economides runs the kind of school that would buttress President Bush's argument for parental choice.
In the 10 years he has been at the school, he has insisted that homework be assigned daily and that students treat teachers and one another with courtesy and respect. Discipline at his school, Mr. Economides says, is as firm as that for which Roman Catholic schools are noted.
Since Mr. Economides arrived at P.S. 51, the school's ranking on the citywide reading test has improved dramatically -- from 619th out of 633 schools to 137th. Today, 64.7 percent of the students read above grade level, compared with 18 percent in 1980.
Still, Mr. Economides is concerned about what might happen should the school lose the Federal funds for remedial programs, which he said amount to almost $100,000 annually.
It could mean the loss of Susan Schauer, the remedial reading teacher, and Milagros Cuevas, the English-as-a-second-language teacher, both of whose salaries are paid out of the funds. It could also mean the loss of two paraprofessionals who work with children who lag behind their classmates. And it could mean more crowded classes for all of the school's 284 students.
Mr. Bush's proposal would apply only to states that allow their own educational aid to follow students from neighborhood public schools to other public schools of their choice, as eight states now do. New York is not among those states, but President Bush is hoping to spur a nationwide movement toward parental choice.
And it is not clear whether Congressional approval of Mr. Bush's choice plan would violate United States Supreme Court rulings affirming the principle of separation of church and state.
Along with most other Catholic schools across the country, Holy Cross, on 43d Street between Eighth and Ninth Avenues, has long fought for increased use of tax dollars to help its students.
 
Crossing the Street
 To receive remedial instruction from teachers financed by the Federal funds, students must leave the red-brick building, cross the street and enter two trailers fitted with classrooms. Such Rube Goldberg-like conditions result from a 1985 Supreme Court decision barring teachers paid through public funds from teaching at church-supported schools.
"If this proposal enables more children to attend our school, we will be delighted," said the Holy Cross principal, Sister Mary Theresa Dixon.
She said that contrary to the myth that only wealthy children can afford private schools, half of her 225 students live at or below the poverty level.
Sister Mary Theresa said her school needed extra Federal money for remedial programs because students come from homes where 18 languages are spoken, including Vietnamese, Hungarian and two dialects of Chinese.
"That raises particular problems for us, problems like English as a second language that are exactly the ones" the Federal funds are supposed to address, she said.
The problems faced by P.S. 51 are not very different from those at Holy Cross.
 
'Inside Here It's an Oasis'
 The public school, at 520 West 45th Street, is a turn-of-the-century, five-story building that dominates a desolate block of automobile repair shops, theatrical supply houses and railroad tracks.
"Outside here, we have prostitutes and drug dealers," Mr. Economides says. "Inside here it's an oasis."
Three-quarters of the students are from Spanish-speaking countries or Puerto Rico, and most of the rest are black or Middle Eastern or Asian immigrants. All but 11 students qualify for a free lunch, and the school easily meets the city's cutoff for eligibility for the Federal funds, which requires 54.1 percent of a schools' students body to receive some form of public assistance or free lunches.
Once a school is eligible, the amount of money is determined not by the numbers of poor children, but by the numbers of those who read and calculate below their grade level. The idea is to concentrate money on helping children with learning deficiencies. In the city as a whole 367,000 of the 956,000 students receive the remedial services.
Mr. Economides has chosen to use much of his money from the Federal program to set up a full-time remedial class for third and fourth graders who read two years or more below their grade or who are recent immigrants. Ms. Schauer, who teaches the class, emphasizes get to reading even when she is teaching mathematics and scienc.
There are 20 students in Ms. Schauer's class, which allows the other third- and fourth-grade classes to have 25 students instead of 30.
On Friday, Ms. Schauer was preparing children to take the citywide reading test that will be given on May 7. She hadthem complete sentences from lists of appropriate words. One reading passage was about cats, and Ms. Schauer asked if anyone had a pet. Daisy Bentley said she had a cat named Calico.
"He's crazy," she said.
 
Impact of Change
 The thought of losing Ms. Schauer upsets Mr. Economides, who came to New York from Greece when he was 11 and was educated in the city's public schools and at private colleges. Not only the neediest students would suffer, he says.
"I only have 13 classes and 17 teachers," he said. "If you take away one teacher and one para, you're making a substantial difference. It would mean classes in the third and fourth grade would have more students. The school as a whole would hurt."
Still, if children from surrounding public schools were to choose Mr. Economides's school, as some now do, and brought Federal money with them, the school might be able to offset its losses.
"I could even get more money," he mused. "There are negative and positive aspects to everything."
A spokesman for the city's Board of Education, said the board did not approve of any plan that could reduce the district's funds from the Federal program.
One student who has chosen P.S. 51 is Shana Nixon, a sixth grader who began attending the school when she lived in the transient Holland Hotel nearby. Now she travels 45 minutes from Brooklyn each day to continue at P.S. 51 rather than attend the school in her neighborhood.
Sister Mary Theresa thinks the increased competition that Mr. Bush hopes to foster will ultimately improveneighboring public schools, which she contends spend far more money for an inferior education. Tuition at her school is between $1,700 and $2,000, which covers much of the school's expenses, while the Board of Education spends an average of $6,000 a year for an elementary school pupil.
"I think we are doing a superior job for a lot less money," the parochial school principal said. "Shifting some money will not only take onerous pressures off us but also put a little more pressure on the public schools to get their act together."

HEADLINE: AFTER THE WAR;
Bush's Plans for Kurds Stir Fears of Indefinite Military Role in Iraq

BYLINE: By PATRICK E. TYLER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 20

 BODY:
The Bush Administration's intervention in Iraq's refugee crisis has raised concerns that it will lead to an indefinite American military presence in a breakaway Kurdish enclave, or a nascent Kurdish state.
A number of Middle East specialists say they believe that President Bush, while taking a substantial risk by sending United States military forces into northern Iraq to establish and protect refugee camps, is addressing a humanitarian imperative to rescue the majority of Iraq's 3.5 million Kurds, who are engaged in a life-threatening exodus the scale of which is unparalleled in their history. 
 Some of those specialists are relatively confident that Mr. Bush will be able to extricate American forces after United Nations and other international relief forces are able to assume the task of feeding and caring for hundreds of thousands of Kurds.
But as the first large-scale campsites were being selected this weekend, the uncertainty coursing through the Bush Administration was apparent.
A number of Government and outside experts say they fear that Iraq's opposition will drag the United States into long-term intervention to protect "enclaves" and "zones" where refugees will refuse to leave as long as Saddam Hussein is in power.
 
Acting as 'Eyes and Ears'
 "The best outcome would be to provide massive humanitarian aid with large numbers of international personnel to supervise it," said Phoebe Marr, an Iraq scholar at the National Defense University. "They could also act as the eyes and the ears of the international community to prevent retribution by the Iraqi Government, and as soon as possible the Kurds could be integrated back into Iraq under some protection from the central Government."
"Now my fear is that the enclaves may become more permanent than we would like," Ms. Marr continued, "and the international involvement may be longer than we like and the Kurds would not be integrated under reasonable terms into their own country."
"Under understandable international pressure we are getting into something, but we cannot yet see a clear way out," she said.
Mr. Bush's refugee relocation plan, shaped in consultation with Britain, France and Turkey, is based not only on providing immediate humanitarian aid. Of greater political importance, it also seeks to prevent a Kurdish migration across Iraq's northern border into Turkey and reverse the tide of Kurds that has already washed into Iran.
By keeping the Kurds in Iraq, the United States and its allies have set the stage to try to force a political solution between the Kurds and the Baghdad Government while also protecting Turkey, a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, Syria and Iran from instability and greater economic burden. The open question remains whether the Kurds will move.
 
Getting Control of Refugees
 The consequences of a sudden migration of more than two million Kurds out of Iraq would only sow the seeds of future rebellions for all three nations, which are home to a total of 20 million Kurds, some experts said. It could also set off an extended guerrilla war in which Iraq's displaced Kurds might seek to harass the Baghdad Government in perpetuity and inflame border tensions in the region.
William Colby, former Director of Central Intelligence, said: "It seems to me that we are back to basic policy that we don't want to dismember Iraq. That means the Kurds will be consigned to living under Iraqi rule, and the test will be if they can get enough guarantees to assure the decency of their treatment for a solution."
An Iraq scholar, Christine Moss Helms, said: "Everything these Governments are doing is to make sure this population of Kurds will be a controlled population. At a minimum they are giving humanitarian aid, but in fact what you are doing is getting them under control while the Turks are doing everything they can to make sure these Kurds don't go further into Turkey."
That strategy also assumes that the United States and its allies will be able to extricate themselves from Kurdish areas after they get their emergency program of refugee centers up and running. United Nations officials thus far have indicated that a great deal of negotiation will have to take place before United Nations forces could step in and assume the task now being performed by thousands of United States Marines and Army personnel backed by more than 100 combat and transport aircraft and dozens of heavy lift helicopters.
 
Short-Term Reconciliation
 In addition, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, Sadako Ogata, told reporters in Geneva Friday that she did not see how the allies would be able to coax hundreds of thousands of Kurds out of the mountains while Mr. Hussein -- the reason for their flight -- remains in Baghdad.
The critical political dimension of Mr. Bush's task in stepping into Iraq's internal affairs is that of building that confidence among the Kurds, who so far have shown no inclination to return to the homes they fled after their failed uprising and the repression that followed it.
 
Baghdad's Control of Cities
 Like it or not, Mr. Bush might be forced to cooperate with Mr. Hussein in fostering a new internal security climate in Iraq. That will also make it easier for Mr. Hussein to protect the integrity of his country as he struggles to rebuild, sell oil and hold on to power.
Kurdish leaders, still disappointed at what they see as Mr. Bush's decision to abandon their insurrection almost as soon as he had encouraged it, do not appear to be opposed to a short-term reconciliation with Baghdad if it means an end to the refugee crisis.
"If that cooperation is for the security and well-being of the refugees, plus a guarantee for their safety, then, yes, it is a good thing," said Latif Rashid, a senior official in the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan. "We consider the refugee problem only temporary, but our goal is to get rid of Saddam Hussein, and we will go on to achieve our national rights in a democratic Iraq."
As the American and allied relief effort moves forward, Mr. Hussein has actively sought to protect Iraq's sovereignty from any intervention that might turn into a permanent occupation or fragmentation of Iraq.
Mr. Hussein has challenged the legality of the military intervention while seeking to displace it with a separate refugee assistance agreement signed in Baghdad between Iraqi officials and a United Nations envoy, Sadruddin Aga Khan.
With 30,000 Iraqi Army troops estimated to be in the northern part of the country, the Baghdad Government is most likely to maintain its control over the major northern cities of Mosul, Zakho, Dohuk, and Erbil even as American soldiers labor on the outskirts putting up tens of thousands of tents, kitchens and portable hospitals to prepare for a carefully staged reverse exodus.
 
Risks of Another Vietnam
 Mr. Colby, who witnessed as a senior C.I.A. official the incremental escalation of the American intervention in Vietnam, said he did not believe the refugee effort begun by Mr. Bush posed the same risks.
Still the operation runs strongly against the grain of United States military officers who live by the post-Vietnam catechism that every military operation must have a clear objective, achievable military goals in support of tangible political objectives.
While the military has responded rapidly to Mr. Bush's directive to enter Iraq's internal turmoil on a humanitarian mission, strong misgivings about the Kurdish intervention are likely to persist, according to Pentagon officials.
"I can tell you the military wants to get out," said an Administration official.

HEADLINE: AFTER THE WAR;
U.S. MARINES LAND IN NORTHERN IRAQ TO SET UP CAMPS

BYLINE: By JOHN KIFNER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DIYARBAKIR, Turkey, April 20

 BODY:
A battalion of American marines landed in northern Iraq today to start building the first refugee camp in what is to be an allied-protected zone for Kurds inside Iraq.
The nearly 500 marines, in full combat gear, flew by helicopter to Zakho, an Iraqi border city about 10 miles from the bustling new American military camp at Silopi, Turkey. They were to be joined, military officials said, by hundreds of British Royal Marine commandos now at the Turkish military airfield here in Diyarbakir and by French paratroopers. 
 An American officer said the allied ground troops, all from elite units, would set up a forward line along the main highway running southeast from Zakho.
 
No Iraqis in Sight
 The goal of the allied operation is to convince more than half a million Kurdish refugees huddling in squalid camps atop remote Turkish mountains that they will be safe from the revenge of Saddam Hussein. The refugees began their mass exodus after a Kurdish uprising after the Persian Gulf war was crushed by the Iraqi Army.
The marines landed in Iraq about 1:30 P.M. local time and soon took control of Zakho, said Lieut. Col. Bob Flocke, a military spokesman who made the trip and then returned here.
"We're there, and they're not," he said, describing the town as almost deserted, with no Iraqi troops.
Thousands of the Kurdish refugees fled Zakho for the mountains more than two weeks ago when the Iraqi Army retook the town, one of the last to fall, from Kurdish rebels. Many of Zakho's inhabitants are now living miserably on a mountainside high above the Turkish village of Isikveren.
 
'To Bring Refugees Back'
 Dayton Maxwell, an official of the United States Agency for International Development, said, "The idea is to bring the residents of Zakho back," adding that the new camp would also be used temporarily to shelter refugees whose homes are deeper inside Iraq.
"Obviously if security is there and the residents of Zakho want to come back, that is the first big step," Mr. Maxwell said.
Colonel Flocke said the camps would be organized and settled according to clan groups.
"They will not be intermixed," he said. "They have to come from groups who know each other, who respect each other, so the organizational structure doesn't have to be built from scratch."
Over 500,000 Kurds, Turkomans, Syrian Christians, Shiite Muslims and deserters from the Iraqi Army fled to the mountains along the Turkish-Iraqi border after President Hussein's forces put down the Kurdish insurgency in northern Iraq as well as a Shiite Muslim revolt in the southeast.
The Marine landing came less than 24 hours after Lieut. Gen. John Shalikasvili of the U.S. Army met with two Iraqi generals and reportedly told them to keep their soldiers at least 19 miles away from Zakho.
The first construction trucks are to roll across the battered bridge over the Hezel River at the Habur border crossing on Sunday morning, said Col. Don Kinghoffer, the Army spokesman at the Incirlik Air Base, command center for the military relief effort.
The construction is being rushed in the hope of bringing the refugees down from the mountains before disease and hunger, which have taken a toll that relief officials fear may be in the thousands, cause more deaths.
"The driving criteria are the terrible conditions in the mountains." said Lieut. Col. Mike Boyce, a Marine attache at the American Embassy who is working with the task force. "We can't leave them in the mountains. We don't have enough time. We don't have any choice. It's too hard, too difficult to feed them."
 
Facing Potential Problems
 The new American-led plan has been pulled together so hastily that vital details are still in flux, say officers working on the operation. The effort faces a number of problems, including the widely voiced reluctance of Kurds in the camps to return to Iraq for fear of retribution from the Iraqi authorities.
The allied deployment is intended to give reassurances. Western diplomats said the Iraqis had been told to withdraw to a line 19 miles south of Zakho so that the Americans can set up what they hope will be transitional camps on the flat plain between the river and the next jagged mountain range in Iraq.
"These guys are like the Berlin Brigade," the Western diplomat said, referring to the troops' function as a tripwire to bring retaliation should the Iraqis attack. "They are there to make the refugees feel safe."
Referring to the Iraqi military, Colonel Boyce said: "If they want to fight, they will be making the second biggest mistake in the last year. These Iraqis are going to have to leave."
But the plan for the safe havens is seen as potentially flawed by many international relief workers and experts in the region's long tribal and ethnic conflicts, including the struggle of the Kurds, a mountain people living in areas near the borders of Iraq, Iran, Turkey and Syria and the Soviet Union, to form their own nation.
In addition to the appalling conditions that the refugees are living in and the political effect that television pictures of their misery have had in the West, the plan to move them back to Iraq is also fueled by the reluctance of the President Turgut Ozal of Turkey to have them here in his poor country's southeastern and largely Kurdish region.
"The Turks see the whole thing as a security problem, rather than a refugee problem," an international aid worker said.
"What we're doing is creating the worst of the West Bank and Gaza Strip and Beirut," said another aid official, whose agency has long experience in those parts of the Middle East. He warned of internal struggles, including the possibility that not only Iraqi Government forces might attack the refugees but also the Marxist Kurdish Workers Party, which might deem them traitors for fleeing in the first place.
"Why should the Kurds believe the Americans?" the official said. "They believed them before, and look what happened." He referred to what were widely taken as American encouragements to the Kurds and other opposition groups to rise up against Mr. Hussein during the war, and a subsequent lack of military backing by Washington.
 
Marines Pour Into Silopi
 The marines who went into Iraq today, from the 24th Marine Expeditionary Unit, based on ships of the Sixth Fleet in the Mediterranean, have for the last few days been pouring into the new base at Silopi, from which military helicopters are flying food, water and medicine to the refugees in Iraq.
On Monday, sheep were grazing in the area. Special Air Force construction crews began putting up tents, and service teams set up kitchens and laundries. By the weekend, the base at Silopi was a humming tent city of some 2,000 troops serving as an American military logistics base. Supplies arrived overland from ports on the Mediterranean, and the base became a camp for the soldiers in Iraq, marines trained in special operations like night attacks and commando raids.
The marines carried night-vision goggles as part of their equipment today as they paused for a moment in prayer before boarding the helicopters to drop into Iraq.
"We do not expect an encounter with the Iraqis, but we are prepared for any contigency," Maj. Ron Gahagan of the Army, the Silopi base spokesman, told reporters.
 
Tents First, Then Buildings
 Silopi was originally intended as an emergency logistics base, officers there said, and now appears to be the logical forward operating point for the move to set up the camps in Iraq.
The current plans, Colonel Boyce said, were to put up tents in the refugee camps in Iraq as a first stage and then to build some kind of wooden buildings. It is hoped, he said, that Kurds who lived inside the protected zone before their exodus would return to their former homes and that others would move into the camps in hopes of going home someday.
The refugees, he said, would probably be brought down from the mountains in trucks, although he cautioned that some of the mountain encampments were so remote they could only be reached by helicopter. The American military is trying to work through traditional clan leaders to persuade the Kurds to go into the bases.
"They have to believe first they are going to be secure, and second that what they're going to have is better than what they have now," he said. "The first is going to be difficult, but if you have seen the camps they are in now, the second is not hard."

Kurd-Iraq Talks Reported
 IN NORTHERN IRAQ, April 20 (AP) -- Leaders of four Kurdish groups are in Baghdad trying to negotiate a settlement to the rebellion against President Saddam Hussein, rebels said today.
The talks started on Friday after Mr. Hussein expressed a readiness "to discuss everything with the Kurdish side except secession," said a rebel close to the Kurdish leadership.
The Kurds had been reluctant to negotiate, fearing that Mr. Hussein would renege on any agreement once his Government recovered from its shattering defeat in Kuwait.
They said they changed their minds in the face of the refugee crisis.
With the talks reportedly under way, Iraq today repeated an amnesty offer for the Kurds, saying they could return within 15 days without fear of retribution. Many Kurds do not believe the offer.

Feeding on 19th Century Conditions, Cholera Spreads in Latin America

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE

DATELINE: LIMA, Peru

 BODY:
WITH the specter of cholera hanging over the Dickensian slums of Latin America, a news magazine here recently reproduced a 19th-century engraving of the Thames alongside a modern-day photo of Lima's sewage-choked River Rimac. The resemblance was striking.
As in 19th-century London, residents of Lima take 70 percent of their piped drinking water from their river, a waterway that also flushes much of their untreated wastes into the sea. 
Now cholera is making its first major visit to the Western Hemisphere in the 20th century. Its explosive spread -- 158,000 cases in Peru in three months -- has focused attention on how millions of Latin America's city dwellers make do with sewage and drinking water facilities reminiscent of 19th-century Europe.
"In Europe, cholera served to awaken people to the need to invest in sanitation," said Uriel Garcia, a doctor and former Peruvian Health Minister. "Today, cholera may awaken governments here and abroad to provide clean drinking water and sewage in Latin America."
Protected by clean water supplies, American epidemiologists today show little concern over the news that three visitors to cholera-plagued areas in the Andes were recently hospitalized in the United States with cholera symptoms. Cholera, spread by bacteria associated with human feces, can kill in less than a day with dehydration from severe diarrhea, nausea and high fever. In societies with good medical care, cholera is preventable and can be treated with antibiotics and intravenous rehydration. The last major American epidemic was in 1866. A minor outbreak along the Louisiana-Texas shoreline in the 1970's and early 1980's sickened 40 people, but none died.
"We have flush toilets, running water, hygienic practices," Myron M. Levine, an epidemiologist with the University of Maryland, said during a visit here last week. "Cholera is not traditionally an upper-class phenomemon. Typically, it's a disease associated with lower socioeconomic groups."
But for Latin America's slum dwellers, for whom clean water is a luxury, cholera could become a major and recurring health threat in the 1990's.
In Peru, 1,140 people have already died. Cholera has spread to Ecuador, Colombia, Chile, and a corner of Brazil's Amazon. Using Peru's experience as a yardstick, health authorities calculate that the disease could sicken 3 million Brazilians this year. Brazil was the site of the Western Hemisphere's last major cholera epidemic, in 1895.
Setting the stage for an explosion of the disease are a parade of statistics: 40 percent of Lima's 7 million residents do not have access to potable, piped water; 40 percent of Brazil's 150 million people do not have access to sewers. Washing hands and boiling drinking water are two vital measures with which even the poor can prevent the spread of cholera in normal times, but Peru's economic crisis has now set off sharp drops in the sales of both hand soap and kerosene.
"When you have to buy water to drink, it is very difficult to think of using water to wash your hands," said Edgard Necochea, a health program director here for the Agency for International Development.
In the mid-19th century, fear that cholera epidemics would recur prompted city authorities to create health boards in London and in New York, according to William H. McNeill's book "Plagues and Peoples." Overruling protests by taxpayers and property owners, these boards expanded underground pipe networks in those cities to provide universal access to clean water and to hygienic sewage disposal.
"The alarm cholera created in American and European cities provided the essential leverage for those reformers who sought to improve urban sanitation, housing, health services and water supply," Mr. McNeill wrote. "Cholera has, in fact, never returned to European cities since, thanks to systematic purification of urban water supplies from bacteriological contamination."
But many officials say there is a major barrier to resolving the problem that way in South America today -- a lack of money.
The Pan American Health Organization calculates that providing adequate water and sewage to Peru's 22 million inhabitants would require an investment by the Government of $320 million a year over the next 10 years. But in recent years, Peru has invested less than one-tenth that amount -- an average of $31 million annually -- and Peru's economy is in the middle of a wholesale collapse; the gross national product has dropped 30 percent in the last three years.
"Peru is 40 years behind in basic sanitation investments," said Eduardo Salazar Lindo, president of Peru's new Cholera Commission. As he spoke in his fourth-floor office at the Health Ministry, chants and police sirens could be heard on the street below. Striking nurses were marching, demanding a raise from their current pay level of $37 a month. Because of the strike, Peru's state-run hospitals confronted the cholera epidemic this month without staff nurses.
Preying on wounded societies, cholera is expected to further weaken Latin America's battered economies. Last February, a wave of barriers flew up around the world to block Peru's food exports. Most of the barriers receded, but at the same time tourism arrivals dropped by 70 percent.
Health experts say that to fight cholera, governments will have to execute long-range campaigns to permanently change the hygiene habits of Latin America's poor through sanitation education and through the universal construction of low-cost latrines, water purification units and rooftop water tanks for schools and for hospitals. For funding, the Pan American Health Organization plans to ask the United States, Europe and Japan to contribute to a $12 billion Latin American emergency health fund.
"Our hope is that cholera will suddenly disappear from Lima and Guayaquil, the way it disappeared from London and Paris," said Dr. Garcia. "Our fear is that it will become endemic, like in parts of Asia and Africa."

A Reward, Not a Cure, for South Africa

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER S. WREN

DATELINE: JOHANNESBURG

 BODY:
IN the nearly 15 months since he set about to end apartheid, President F. W. de Klerk has tried to convince the world that the political changes he set in motion were irreversible. Last week, the European Community took him at his word, lifting a trading ban, imposed in 1986, on iron, steel and gold coins from South Africa. The community's move, which followed by four months its lifting of a ban on new investments, was welcomed here as presaging the end of an international framework of sanctions enacted in protest against the racist ideology that Mr. de Klerk is dismantling.
"The psychological effect of the decision is important," Foreign Minister Roelof F. Botha said at a news briefing. "It should now make it clear to South Africans that the way the State President has chosen is the way that Europe will support." 
 President de Klerk left Friday on a trip to Britain, Denmark and Ireland, amid euphoric domestic expectations that the European Community's decision could lead to other dividends, including an end to the international sports boycott that would put South African athletes back into the Olympics by 1992.
Yet South Africa, burdened by a predicted zero growth rate this year, 14 percent inflation and a scarcity of foreign capital, will find it hard to take advantage of the windfall without addressing the poverty, joblessness and attendant violence afflicting the nation's black majority.
"What we cannot do is attract new investments in an atmosphere of violence," Finance Minister Barend du Plessis warned recently. Without new markets, he said, South Africa would not be able to grow. And without growth, he said, the economy could spiral downward into chaos.
In 1986, South Africa was selling 400,000 to 500,000 tons of steel a year to European countries, according to Leslie Boyd, the chairman of the Highveld Steel and Vanadium Corporation. With the embargo, the industry had to turn to less profitable overseas markets. Now, Mr. Boyd said, "the only significant steel market still closed to South Africa is the United States."
But South Africa needs new investment to offset a capital outflow of 30 billion rand, currently about $11 billion, between 1985 and 1990. The fear is that the political violence, which killed more than 3,000 blacks last year and has killed close to 600 so far this year, could scare away potential investors, who might feel safer putting their money in Eastern Europe. "As we all know, investors do not easily invest in a situation where people are killing each other on such a scale in this bloodthirsty manner," Mr. Botha said.
His concern was echoed in the white business community. "Unless there are greater efforts towards unity and peace in our country, we will scuttle whatever benefits may accrue," said Deryk Spence, the chief executive of Castrol, the petroleum company.
 
A Question of Timing
 In lifting the sanctions, the European Community disregarded a plea from the African National Congress to let it decide when sanctions should go. The congress, which is maneuvering for advantaqge in future talks with the Government, has accused it of failing to stem the township violence. The congress warned that lifting sanctions would make Pretoria more intransigent. As sanctions evaporate, the congress may fall back on its strategy of "mass action" -- strikes, boycotts and other protests -- that could add to instability.
 Those reconsidering the efficacy of sanctions include a longtime proponent, the Anglican Archbishop Desmond M. Tutu. But the congress has not given up on sanctions. "Where we have failed at a multilateral level, we will take it up with individuals," Saki Macozoma, a congress spokesman, said after the community's decision. Nelson Mandela, the African National Congress's deputy president, was likely to argue for keeping sanctions on a visit to Japan, but the prime target was bound to be the United States Congress, which imposed the most stringent sanctions in 1986. Once Mr. de Klerk has freed political prisoners and repealed all apartheid laws, as he has promised, he will have met, in theory, all terms for lifting sanctions.
Sanctions have hit blacks hard, eliminating old jobs and failing to create new ones. Over a third of the country's potential labor force of 12 million now lacks formal employment and only 12 in every 100 newcomers can find work. Despair and deprivation engendered by the lack of opportunity have contributed to rising crime and instability.
Mangosuthu Buthelezi, leader of the Inkatha Freedom Party, whose differences with the African National Congress have fueled factional fighting between their respective supporters, said sanctions should never have been applied because apartheid's victims suffer first. The congress says the jobless are casualties in a just war against apartheid. In fact, joblessness is also related to other factors like the declining price of gold, which produced an announcement last week that another 12,500 mine workers, most of them black, would be laid off.
The gloomiest prognosis has come from the Government itself, which says it does not have the resources to eliminate gross disparities between blacks and whites.
Chris Stals, the Governor of the South African Reserve Bank, told an economic conference in Italy earlier this month that South Africa could become ungovernable by 1995 unless its economy improves. Mr. Stals suggested that the mysterious "third force" that Mr. Mandela and others have blamed for abetting township unrest might be the economy itself. "We must not overlook the influence of the low growth rate on the prevailing violence," he said.

Old Habits Ensnare the Middle East Again

BYLINE: By JUDITH MILLER

 BODY:
APPEARANCES in the Middle East are almost always deceiving. The Persian Gulf war was initially and widely acclaimed as a decisive victory for the United States-led coalition. So it was, militarily. But it seemed decidedly less glorious last week as 10,000 American soldiers scoured the harsh Iraqi landscape seeking suitable terrain for vast refugee camps to save hundreds of thousands of desperate Kurds, the unanticipated human debris of the conflict.
And any expectations that the victory of arms would reverse historical trends, shatter traditional alliances, and bring gains for peace and stability in the region seemed last week to have been very premature. They seemed to have been overpowered both by patterns and rhythms long entrenched in Middle Eastern politics and by the consequences of an event much more far-reaching even than the war -- the disappearance of the Soviet Union as a player in that part of the world. 
 "What initially looked like a watershed in the Mideast may turn out to be one very long, loud hiccup," said a veteran diplomat in Tunisia, which opposed the presence of American forces in the region. "It was the collapse of the Soviet Union that made the gulf war possible."
From Morocco to Oman, in lands that backed the coalition and in those that did not, anxiety about the region's future is growing once more.
Before the war, optimistic analysts in Arab capitals and in Washington predicted that a decisive, quick military victory for the American-led coalition would address several major causes of instability. First, the argument went, the victory would make apparent the bankruptcy of Saddam Hussein's dictatorial form of government and thus reinforce democratic trends. Second, it would bolster prospects for economic development and dramatize the need to close the enormous gap between rich and poor Arab countries. And it would shift traditional, but outmoded, Arab political alignments; this, in turn, would enhance prospects for peace between Israel and the Arabs.
Even before the war was fought, analysts were hailing the emergence of the anti-Iraq coalition, which aligned wealthy Saudi Arabia with populous Egypt and militarily powerful Syria. In contrast to the Arab League, which had been rendered impotent by ideological, economic and geographic divisions, it was said that this new alliance would be more stable and would operate on pragmatic, realistic calculations. The Arabs' more extreme fringes would be neutralized and their self-deluding mythologies and oratory about political unity would be dropped.
But some analysts now fear that the new axis may itself be unstable. "Saudi Arabia and Egypt have long been suspicious of each other, for history, envy, and other good reasons," a senior Egyptian diplomat said. And many analysts say Syria's recent pragmatism predates the war; it is, they argue, much more a consequence of the decline of Damascus's traditional patron, the Soviet Union. By the time the gulf crisis began last summer, Damascus had few options but to seek economic and military support from the United States and the countries that rapidly became its new coalition partners.
At the same time, the outcome of the war does not seem to have led very many Arabs to abandon their dreams of pan-Arab or Islamic unity. And despite reports anticipating its demise, the Arab League clings to life.
Prospects for economic development or for closing the gaps between rich and poor nations have also not been enhanced by the war. The chances for sustained growth in Egypt are not good despite Cairo's efforts to restructure its economy. Saudi aid -- more than $2 billion in loans and debt forgiveness -- offers "a window of opportunity to resolve our economic problems," said Boutros Ghali, Egypt's Minister of State for Foreign Affairs, "if we choose to use it." But there is also strong temptation to use the aid to continue deferring the painful economic restructuring that most Western economists say is essential to attracting investment.
No assistance from the gulf countries, moreover, can be expected for the Sudan, an economic basket case, or for Jordan and other poor countries that opposed the coalition. Even a proposal by Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d to establish a bank for reconstruction and development was quickly rejected by the White House. The Administration, instead, has sought reparations for Kuwait from devastated Iraq.
Prospects for Arab-Israeli peace have been improved only a little. While Saudis and Israelis shared the terror of being targeted by Iraqi Scud missiles during the war, Riyadh and other coalition members today are resisting the confidence-building measures being promoted by Mr. Baker on his tours of the Middle East. And the Government of Yitzhak Shamir, though ready to endorse some aspects of Mr. Baker's approach to setting up talks, is still resisting the fundamental principle that underlies key United Nations resolutions -- trading occupied territory for peace.
Perhaps most bitter of all to many Arab democrats is what they see as the Bush Administration's endorsement of brutal dictatorship, even if it is still that of Saddam Hussein, as the preferred form of government for Iraq. One uncomfortable fact that the Administration had to contend with during the war was that with the exception of Egypt, the Arab countries with the most active movements seeking democratization -- Jordan, Yemen and Algeria -- opposed the use of American forces to do battle with Iraq. Edward Mortimer, a British analyst of Arab affairs, commented in the latest issue of The New York Review of Books that the Administration's standard seemed to be that "while dictatorship is regarded as abnormal and in the last resort unacceptable if applied to Europeans, it is assumed to be, for Arab and Muslim peoples, the only workable alternative to traditional monarchy or to direct colonial rule by external powers."
Competing impulses weighed heavily on the Bush Administration last week as American troops sought once more to keep the peace. Its repeated statements that the Kurdish refugee rescue project would neither delay the homecoming of American forces nor draw the United States even deeper into Iraq's tortured politics reflected the enduring legacy of Vietnam -- a lingering fear of entangling involvements in unwinnable or unpopular conflicts far from home.
In the end, that fear was overcome by worry that the victory in Iraq was being sullied by seeming indifference to the plight of the Kurds, who had taken their cue from American pleas for Iraqis to rise up against their despotic ruler and whose straits now simply horrified many Americans. Mindful that the victorious American forces had stood by while Saddam Hussein crushed the Kurds' rebellion, Americans wanted President Bush to do something. So he did. But still American officials made it clear that they would ultimately prefer for Iraq a predictable, if nasty, dictator over an unpredictable effort to form a coalition or democratic government that could yield to the "Lebanonization," or bloody breakup, of Iraq.
This way of thinking, too, is nothing new. Through its support for the Shah in Iran, its tilt toward Saddam Hussein during the Iran-Iraq war, or the new reasons it has now found to work with the shrewd, patient and sometimes ruthless President Hafez al-Assad of Syria, the United States has often shown that it fears the consequences of encouraging democracy in the Arab Middle East.

Albany's Budget-Balancing 'One-Shots' Will Reverberate for Years to Come

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH KOLBERT

DATELINE: ALBANY

 BODY:
UNLIKE the Federal Government, New York State, as Gov. Mario M. Cuomo likes to point out, does not have the capacity to print money when it needs it. But it does have something almost as good -- and almost as troubling. It has one-shots.
One-shots, simply put, are revenues from sources like reserve funds or proceeds from the sale of public property that the state can use -- one time, that is -- to balance its budget when tax collections fall short. Yet they are rarely simple. Often the state indulges in complex refinancing schemes and asset transfers that provide easy money up front, but in the long run cost taxpayers millions of dollars. 
 In recent years, as New York has sunk deeper into the red, the state has become increasingly inventive in coming up with one-shots; just recently, for example, it managed to sell its Attica prison, site of the bloody uprising in 1971, to one of its own authorities, the Urban Development Corporation, for a cool $200 million.
But as New York's use of one-shots has grown, so too has the criticism of the practice. Many analysts say the arrangements are emblematic of the buy-now-pay-later approach to budgeting that put New York into the fiscal mess it is in now. And as the state grapples with a budget gap of $6 billion -- a spending plan for the current fiscal year, due three weeks ago, is still nowhere near completion -- the issue of how much the state should rely on these special deals to balance its books is once again being grimly debated.
"Of all the proposals that have come forward, one-shots are the least courageous," said Raymond Horton, president of the Citizens Budget Commission, a watchdog group financed by business. "They simply postpone the day of reckoning; they don't prevent the day of reckoning."
The problem, fiscal experts say, is that one-shots by definition work only once, while the expenses they are financing are recurring. If the state uses a nonrecurring revenue to pay for an ongoing expense, then the next year it is likely to be faced with the same shortfall all over again.
"It's not the best financial management," said Charles Stein, past president of the New York State Government Finance Officers Association. "Because what do you do the next year, when you run out of one-shots?"
Last year, New York's reliance on such measures reached what many experts believe to be a record high; the budget was precariously balanced with almost $2 billion in nonrecurring revenues. This was one of several reasons why the state's credit rating was dropped two notches, to the third lowest in the country.
While New York had routinely raided its reserve funds for extra cash in the past, 1990 was the year when the art of the one-shot deal reached new extremes.
Take, for instance, the recently completed sale of Attica. The state paid for the prison once when it was built in 1931. Now it has sold the prison to the Urban Development Corporation in return for $200 million in cash. Over the next 30 years the state will buy the prison back, essentially paying for it twice. The irony of the sale was not lost on its many critics, who noted that the Urban Development Corporation's original mandate when it was set up in 1968 was to "facilitate the development of affordable housing for low-income persons."
This is how the deal works: In order to come up with cash for the state, the corporation had to issue bonds. These bonds are to be retired using payments the state will make to lease Attica for its prisoners. Once the bonds are paid off, three decades from now, the state will once again own Attica. But in the process of buying back the prison, the state will not only have to repay the $200 million purchase price, but will also have to pay, according to estimates by the State Comptroller's office, some $290 million in interest costs.
Many officials argue that such deals are justified by New York's fiscal straits. "We did not want to raise another $200 million in taxes, and we did not want to make another $200 million in cuts when the economic forecast was that this was a temporary downturn," said Claudia Hutton, a spokeswoman for the state budget director. "This was in essence taking out a second mortgage."
But others say that the one-shot strategems are simply exacerbating, rather than solving, the state's problems. Mr. Stein contends that New York City's fiscal crisis in the mid-1970's was brought, at least in part, by the extensive reliance on one-shot deals to meet budget needs.
Still smarting from criticism about last year's fiscal legerdemain, Governor Cuomo proposed a much more modest menu of one-shots this year, totaling by his estimates roughly $600 million -- and by the State Comptroller's office roughly $1 billion. These proposals include the sale of Aqueduct race track to the Port Authority and the sale of route I-84 to the Thruway Authority.
In recent weeks, however, there has been growing pressure from the Republican-controlled State Senate to increase the use of one-shots. When the Senate proposed its alternative to the Governor's budget earlier this month, it offered a menu of some $1.3 billion worth of possible new one-shots, including calling in some $500 million of long-standing debts that are owed to the state from various authorities.
The plan prompted State Comptroller Edward V. Regan, also a Republican, to warn that "recent budget proposals and pronouncements raise the specter that the proliferation of one-shots may increase." And Mr. Cuomo warned that "any attempt to close a substantial part of the gap through one-shots would be unacceptable."
But as they like to say in Albany, where major decisions are invariably made at the last moment, "It ain't over till it's over." When the only other choice is a new tax, one-shots can start to look pretty irresistible.
 
FULLY SECURED
As one source of revenue to close Albany's continual budget gap, the state has sold Attica Correctional Facility to the Urban Development Corporation. The money paid by the U.D.C. went into the general state budget, and Albany will lease the facility back, paying the U.D.C. enough each year to repay the original purchase price, plus 30 years of interest.
 
U.D.C. purchase price for Attica prison -- $200 million
Interest (8% for 30 years) -- $290 million
In effect, the state borrows $200 million for immediate use, paying $290 million over 30 years for doing so. (Sources: Division of the Budget; State Comptroller's Office)

For Some Two-Paycheck Families, The Economics Don't Add Up

BYLINE: By TAMAR LEWIN

 BODY:
SHE wakes when the baby cries, gets the baby dressed and fed, then puts on her own blouse and suit ($340, plus $11 for dry-cleaning), snags her pantyhose ($2), waits for the baby sitter ($60 a day), crams into the subway ($1.15), picks up coffee and a bagel ($1), goes to the office, meets a friend for lunch ($7), goes back to work, then home on the subway ($1.15), picking up dinner at the gourmet deli ($12) because she won't have time to cook.
And every payday, she asks herself the prime postfeminist question: should women with young children work? 
 Financially, the answer may be no -- at least for professional women, and at least in the short run.
For while more than half of all women with preschool children now hold paid jobs, many discover with dismay that their earnings are barely enough to pay for child care, taxes and the other expenses of working.
Soul-searching about whether the second income really makes the family any better off has become a staple of playground talk. Women's magazines have picked up the issue, too, as in Redbook's April article, "I Couldn't Afford My Job," a first-person account of a woman who quit upon finding that two-thirds of her take-home pay went straight to the baby sitter and the remaining third was too small to pay for office clothes, time-saving foods, transportation and the new higher tax bracket.
The personal math differs from family to family, and it rarely comes down to a simple accountant's tally. For many new mothers, decisions about whether, when and how much to work are complicated with a heavy overlay of feelings about family life, commitment to career, financial independence, personal identity and motherhood.
And having a chance to choose between going back to work and staying home with the baby is a luxury that millions of single mothers and less affluent women cannot afford. For women who are the primary support of their families, and those whose husbands earn $30,000 or less, paid work is usually a necessity: however low the wife's net pay, it is crucial to the family's finances.
It is impossible to generalize about how much a second job will yield because family spending patterns vary so widely, depending on such variables as commuting distance, child care and clothing needs. But because poorer families spend less on everything from day care to meals out, substantially more of their second income remains to be spent on other things.
For example, a suburban Minneapolis couple in which the husband earns $25,000 and the wife earns $16,000 would be likely to spend about $60 a week to keep the baby in family day care at a neighbor's house. Assuming that the wife spent $20 a week for coffee and lunches, and $15 a week for work clothes, the family would still come out more than $6,000 ahead if she keeps her job. And for that family, $6,000 represents about a 30 percent increase over the disposable income they would have if only the husband worked.
A Difference of $6,000
But in higher-income families, there is often a real question about whether the family reaps any significant financial benefit from the wife's work. A New York City family in which the husband earns $70,000 and the wife $50,000, might well pay $300 a week for a baby sitter to come to their home -- but as the adjacent chart shows, with other expenses that family's income would increase by less than $6,000 as a result of the wife's work, a difference that may not mean much improvement in the standard of living.
But most economists, feminists and social policy experts argue that even for women whose take-home pay covers nothing more than child care costs and commuting, staying in the work force is a rational economic decision over the long term.
"It's true that in the short run, for a few years, you might not keep much of your earnings," said Sheila Kamerman, a social policy professor at the Columbia University School of Social Work. "But continuing to work is an investment in your future earnings, and there does come a time when the child-care costs diminish, the wife's salary will probably go up, and there is a clear financial benefit. Meanwhile, women who take a long time out of the workforce are likely to find that they cannot command the same kind of salary when they are ready to go back in."
Experts also note that it is risky to depend on the father as sole wage-earner, given the harsh realities of layoffs, divorce and widowhood. And many cavil at the whole analysis, considering it wrong-headed to view child care costs as an expense to be charged against the mother's income.
"It's completely sexist to say that child care comes out of the mother's salary," argued Heidi Hartmann, director of the Institute for Women's Policy Research in Washington, "Child care is a family expense, like the mortgage or the heat."
In theory, maybe. But as a practical matter, child-care costs are different from other family budget items, since they can be avoided by one parent's staying home.
Many feminists use such budget analyses to argue for a national family policy that would improve the quality and affordability of child care and help mothers who work outside the home.
Men and women alike may question why it should be the mother who considers leaving her job -- but as a practical matter, working women earn 68 cents for every dollar men earn, and are therefore the obvious candidates for child care, another poorly paid job.
Sexism and policy issues aside, there is at least one economic analysis suggesting that mothers who do stay home don't save all that much. According to a 1989 study by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, two-earner families spend only 18 percent more for child care than families in which the wife doesn't work -- and less than 5 percent more for women's apparel and food away from home.
"There are differences, but statistically, across all income groups, they just aren't that big," said Eva Jacobs, an author of the study. "It's not every working woman that wears office clothes and has lunch in a restaurant -- and the women who stay home have to have clothes and lunch, too."
Susan Swain, who left her job in community relations at a Connecticut utilities company in 1986, remembers her decision to quit her three-day-a-week job and stay home with her children. Although Ms. Swain works part time, her example echoes many of the problems faced by professional women with young children.
"My husband and I sat down and figured out that my salary, which was in the $35-$40,000 range, was just bumping him into a higher tax bracket," she said. "We were paying $250 a week for three days of child care for the two kids, and then I still neededbaby sitters to do the shopping and things on the days I was home. I was a professional, so I needed nice clothes, and my driving around meant a lot of wear and tear on the car. My husband is an accountant, and he said we were not making a lot of money on this. And I really wanted to be around more for my children."
It did not relieve the family of all costs, though: Ms. Swain ended up with a live-in nanny for two years after she left her job. With her youngest now in kindergarten, she has started a part-time job close to home.
"If I had wanted to get back in where I left, I might have had to step back in salary a year or two," she said. "I'm lucky to have been able to afford to do it this way, and I'm happy with the choices I've made. But if there's one thing I've learned, it's that there is no right answer. Everybody has to do what works best for them."

Mission Possible

BYLINE: By LESLIE H. GELB

 BODY:
Nothing is impossible when it comes to Iraq. Everything is impossible when it comes to America. That is the misguided message emanating from much of Washington and the think-tank world.
 American leaders, at their most farsighted, hesitated only momentarily to sacrifice lives and fortune to drive Iraq from Kuwait. But when it comes to fixing up a disintegrating America, the task is beyond the skills and scope of government, they say. 
 Legions of pundits and experts demand that we now make a major effort to bring democracy to Iraq. But when it comes to doing something about America's deteriorating public schools -- the foundation of our democracy -- only very modest steps can be taken, they say.
The best minds and most powerful Americans, crying with wonderful outrage and passion, have mobilized to save the Kurds. But few have dollars and tears left for the crack babies, the homeless, the squalor and hopelessness of our poor -- the "Kurds of America."
 Don't tell me there is no money. Don't say these problems here at home are too vast and complicated to be addressed by government.
 We have heard enough of this fashionable intellectual defeatism from neo-conservatives, neo-liberals and now even from confused and self-doubting liberals, most of whom argue we can achieve anything in Iraq.
 The magnitude of the task and the money did not stop us in the Persian Gulf. The challenge of repairing America's roadways, railways, airports and public education system is no greater nor more complicated than that of transforming Iraq into a democracy. The passion and commitment to save the Iraqi Kurds also belong to America's Kurds.
 Rescuing America is no less a national emergency than restoring Kuwaiti sovereignty and helping a persecuted people in a distant land. It is more of an emergency -- for the world and for ourselves.
The Kurds can seek their freedom because there is a strong America willing to protect them. Our democracy and our free-enterprise economy were the lights that freedom fighters followed in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union.
 Our political and economic systems have been the models for the world. How ironic that just when nations finally reject Communism, our political and economic systems show terminal signs of stalemate and structural rot.
 Hysterical nonsense, the neos and cluck-cluckers say as the stock market surges over 3,000 and as they drive out to their country homes and send their children to private schools.
 Drive into New York City from La Guardia Airport and gaze on the filth people have learned to live with. Turn off the highway and motor through Harlem, more bombed out than Baghdad, and look at the dozens of black men on the corner of 112th Street and Lexington Avenue. Drugs everywhere. Go to this city's schools where young kids pass through metal detectors to catch the guns and knives they bring to menace others and defend themselves.
 Young people from other industrialized countries have long since surpassed ours in math and science skills. Germany and Japan have long since built better cars.
 Turn on your television and listen to younger Americans of all races talk. Few can communicate simple ideas in anything resembling English. Many of the Kurds being interviewed on Turkish mountaintops speak better English than our own people.
 Bend the ears of Bush Administration officials, legislators and experts, and you will hear these answers: Well, the American people just don't see the situation as a national crisis. Well, it takes Presidential leadership. Well, President Bush isn't interested in domestic affairs. Well, we have a Congress controlled by Democrats and a Republican President. Well, George Bush is moving now with educational reform. Well, you just can't throw money at these problems.
 Well, they are all right -- and dead wrong. If the United States, if these very same people, had bowed to such "realities" in the Persian Gulf, we never would have lifted a finger there. What gave us strength in the gulf was our national resolve and passion, the very ingredients needed now to find the money and the ideas to save ourselves.

HEADLINE: Public Servants: Public Spirited?

 BODY:
Where is labor?
As New York City rides deeper into fiscal stringency, its municipal union leaders continue to respond mainly to their narrow constituencies. That is lamentable; historically, labor leaders have often been social statesmen, as in the fiscal crisis of the 1970's. And it is counterproductive even in narrow terms. As New York City goes, so go its employees. If the city is to bounce back, it needs conscientious help from all sides, including -- indeed, especially from -- labor. 
 The city's immediate problem is a $465 million budget deficit in the 10 weeks remaining in this fiscal year. Closing it in so short a period is no easy task. The temptation will be to patch and paste in ways that will increase the deficit next year. That can be avoided with another approach, the most sensible one available: for labor to go along with the Dinkins administration proposal to furlough city workers, on a rotating basis, for at least three days.
Furloughing non-essential, non-emergency employees -- about two-thirds of the city's work force -- would save about $30 million a day. Furloughs are a last resort and an unpleasant one. They deny employees income and deny taxpayers services. But with the economy so weak and the city's problems so large, furloughs provide the cleanest, most direct way to save money fast. To ask public servants to contribute in this way to the city's salvation is only to ask for reasonable sacrifice.
So far, the fiscal crisis has meant little to the municipal unions. While Gov. Mario Cuomo is imposing a wage freeze on state employees, several city unions have already won raises, and the teachers' union agreed to a wage deferral only in exchange for sweeteners that will benefit the union in the future at a cost to the city.
Labor leaders now denounce the idea of furloughs in the same spirit, positioning themselves to extract concessions in return for cooperating. That is their standard role, getting the most they can for their members. But in this gathering crisis, there is another role for them: to step up to labor's tradition of social responsibility.
What's more, agreeing to a furlough would be in labor's own interest. If the city is forced to push 1991 costs into 1992, the likelihood of layoffs will increase. The anticipated deficit starting July 1 is already $3 billion -- and counting. Small wage losses now can help avoid lost jobs later. That in itself represents quite an incentive for the unions -- substantial enough for Mr. Dinkins to win their support without making any concessions.
New York City would not have emerged whole from the fiscal crisis of the 70's without help, indeed without leadership, from its labor unions. They can be a large part of the solution again, if their leaders now bring public spirit to the way they represent public servants.

HEADLINE: Privacy of Woman in Rape Case Was Invaded;
Meaningless Details

 BODY:
To the Editor:
I am outraged by your April 17 article about the woman in the Florida rape inquiry, who you say "moved sharply up the economic scale 10 years ago." The only jump up the economic ladder you discuss is that the alleged victim's divorced mother married a man supposedly more financially secure than her first husband. Hardly relevant to the victim's character or the case. 
 Moreover, questions of naming the victim of a rape aside, you go much further in giving negative, meaningless details of the alleged victim's life in a blatant attempt to cast doubt on her character. What could information about how many parking tickets she has received, how fast she was going at the time, her high school academic record or that, like hundreds of thousands of women across the country, she is an unmarried mother possibly have to do with whether or not she was the victim of a rape in the morning of March 31?
You are playing the old game of discrediting the victim of a rape, which serves a twofold purpose: it often gets the attacker off the hook, and it makes hundreds of innocent victims afraid to come forward. A woman does not deserve to be raped whether or not she, like many other women and many men, patronizes bars, receives traffic tickets or lives in Palm Beach.
If you consider this type of personal information about the alleged victim necessary to serious reporting, then why didn't you give equal space to intimate details about the alleged rapist?

HEADLINE: Streetscapes: The 168th Street IRT Station;
Vaulted Grandeur Deep Underground

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER GRAY

 BODY:
THE IRT No. 1 line's elegant, barrel-vaulted 168th Street station received a $2.5 million rehabilitation last year that not only cleaned up some of the rougher spots, but also highlighted the clash of architectural esthetics and bureaucratic reality.
 New York's first subway opened in 1904 but reached only to 137th Street and Broadway. Two years later the vast stations at 168th and 181st and Broadway were opened. At these points the line is about 100 feet below surface, too deep for cut and cover construction. So the contractors blasted through rock for the tunnel and enlarged it to about 50 by 300 feet for the stations. 
Joseph Cunningham, a transportation writer, said the stations were designed, like the earlier stations, by Heins & Lafarge. They used the same elements as in earlier stations -- rich orange, iron-spot brick, soft mosaic patterns, deeply veined marble trim and Jacobean-style iron guard rails. But the long open station area is the astounding thing in a system usually marked by low ceilings and screens of columns.
 At the southern end of the vault the double portal over the tracks lends a railroad grandeur to what in other areas is just a utilitarian hole. Along the center line of the ceiling run a series of terra cotta medallions (for long-lost light fixtures), multicolored explosions of geometric meanders and lengthy floral work. Across the tracks runs the original elevated pedestrian crossing to the original elevator shaft on the east side.
 Although these spaces are among the most spectacular subterranean vistas in New York, the Landmarks Preservation Commission has designated only the earlier, 1904 stations of the IRT line. But the Transit Authority has made an attempt to recognize the 168th Street station's historic character. Strip fluorescent lighting has been replaced by reproduction torcheres on the side walls and fluted, park-type lamp standards on the overpasses.
 The lower walls have been given new tile and the careless runs of conduit, piping and other baggage have been removed or minimized. Some missing decorative tiles have been patched. The great tan brick vault has been swept of loose dirt, but not properly cleaned, and is still spotty and discolored. It is a small advance.
 TO analyze the methodology of station design and repair is to see how good intentions fight a host of obstacles. The lighting is one example.
 Robert Lombardi, the director of architecture, says the alternative to fluorescents, a mercury sodium mixture, produces the same number of foot candles. But the new mercury-sodium lights in old-style (but not original) fixtures have a smoky, orange glow. The station seems dark and riders complain, regardless of the meter reading.
 Mr. Lombardi also wanted to clean the vault, which would have helped brighten the station. But the Transit Authority requires chemicals much milder than those most building contractors use, and test patches gave spotty results. Also, the scaffolding for a full-scale cleaning would have been an enormous project with safety hazards for commuters.
 The new tile is the typical modern variety, with a deckled finish that does not remotely approach the deep, dreamy translucence of the original glass tile. But Mr. Lombardi says that only one company -- in Czechoslovakia -- stocks the old-style tile and that a trial order inexplicably cracked.
 Workmanship on tile and marblework, particularly the delicate border of a giant groin vault leading to the original elevator shaft, is wretched, with large smears of grout and poor installation and fitting.
 Some of the problems are in deciding what is original in the station. There is a collection of 50,000 historic subway photographs at the New-York Historical Society, but the society has no index to the material. The New York Transit Museum Archives has index books to the collection, but Richard Hellinger, the archivist, says they are too fragile even for use by authority employees. Some Transit Authority people have gone through most of the collections for specific projects, but no one has bothered to make even a rough list of the stations pictured in the collection for future reference.
 One problem is Transit Authority policy. It calls for three kinds of station improvements, none of which involves restoration. Such decisions are ad hoc, and economies of scale for a preservation-related approach -- from tile replacement to historic photographs -- do not exist. Station changes are considered individually even though the stations are a giant coherent act of architectural patronage.
 Such an environment makes the little advances at 168th Street seem like giant strides. And that, in itself, is the pity of it.

High-Seas Reprieve of Atlantic Salmon

 BODY:
Champions of the Atlantic salmon are delighted with the news that high-seas harvesting of the species by boats from the Faeroe Islands has been halted. The Faeroes are a group of Danish islands in the North Atlantic between Iceland and the Shetland Islands.
 The longline fishery, which began in the last decade, had been intercepting salmon bound for their home rivers in Norway, the United Kingdom, Ireland and Iceland. 
Wilfred Carter, president emeritus of the Canadian-American Atlantic Salmon Federation, said that the owners of the 26 Faeroese vessels authorized to fish for salmon had agreed to leave the fish alone for the rest of this season and during 1992 and 1993 as well.
 The fishermen will be compensated for this, says Carter: $582,000 in 1991 and 1992 and $688,000 in 1993. The first partial payment is scheduled for July.
 The unusual pact was agreed to April 15 by the fishermen. Orri Vigfusson, an Icelandic businessman, is the one most responsible for achieving the agreement, said David R. Clark, president of the federation, who added that it is a historic event in Atlantic salmon conservation.
 Vigfusson, whose company produces a vodka known by the brand name Icy, is a passionate Atlantic salmon angler. He said the settlement was reached after 18 months of negotiations and adds that Halldor Asgrimsson, Iceland's Minister of Fisheries, had given great assistance to the effort.
 Vigfusson also says that the Faeroese government has informed him that it supports the agreement. Looking ahead, Vigfusson sees a time when those in a Greenland high-seas salmon fishery may be similarly wooed.
 The Atlantic salmon's oceanic wanderings make proper management of the fish a matter of international concern. Spawned in clear, cold streams, young salmon descend to the sea to attain growth and maturity, then return in one, two or three years to repeat the cycle.
 Nearly all the salmon that survive their oceanic odyssey return unerringly to the streams in which their lives began. Unlike the various Pacific salmon, all of which die after the act of procreation, many Atlantic salmon are multiple spawners.
 When at sea, Atlantic salmon from many countries mingle together on their feeding grounds. Because of this, it is possible that salmon stocks from a single river could be devastated by a high-seas fishery.
 In the early 1960's, native Greenlanders launched a drift-net fishery for salmon in the Davis Strait. The salmon in that location were from rivers in Canada, the United States, Europe and the United Kingdom. That fishery now operates under a quota established by the North Atlantic Salmon Conservation Organization, whose members are salmon-producing nations.
 The North Atlantic organization's most recent quotas for the Greenland and Faeroese fisheries were 840 and 550 metric tons, respectively. In recent years, the fishermen in both endeavors were able to harvest only about half of their quotas. Salmon were in short supply.
 Ideally, salmon should not be harvested until they reach their home rivers. Were that the case, those responsible for each river's salmon production could make sure that enough fish got past the nets and past the anglers to achieve optimum production.
 Even when salmon do reach their home continent, they are sometimes intercepted by nets long before they reach their home streams. A fixed-net fishery off Newfoundland captures many salmon bound for other provinces in Canada and the United States, and an unlicensed drift-net fishery off Ireland is similarly indiscriminate.
 Although Atlantic salmon farming, which was pioneered by Norway, now accounts for most of the salmon that go to market (in 1990, 225,000 of the 235,000 metric tons harvested were from salmon farms) commercial pressure on wild salmon remains intense.
 Those who would greatly curtail or even ban commercial fishing for salmon point out that a salmon taken by a sport fisherman is worth many times more to the general economy than one caught by a commercial fisherman. In Canada, the average guided angler spends about $350 to catch a single salmon; that same fish, assuming an average weight of 10 pounds, is worth about $35 to the netter.
 Canada has banned commercial netting for salmon in New Brunswick. At the start of the ban, netters were compensated annually for not fishing. The Government then instituted a voluntary program in which the netters were paid a single lump sum to relinquish their licenses for all time.
 All save 100 or so netters took advantage of this. Carter believes that salmon netting will never resume in the province and that the government will soon make another license-buying offer.
 Canada has also purchased netting licenses in Newfoundland. A private organization, the Atlantic Salmon Conservation Trust of Scotland, has been buying up netting rights on some of that country's rivers.
 The Faeroese agreement differs from these arrangements in that compensation is continuing and the right to fish is not permanently relinquished. All the funds are not yet in hand.
 Under the pact's terms, Norway would pay 55 percent, Iceland 6 percent, the United Kingdom 22 percent and Ireland 17 per ent. This formula is based on the ratio of tagged fish from those countries captured in the Faeroese fishery.
 Salmon anglers and conservationists the world over, including the Canadian-American salmon federation's members, will also be asked to contribute to the Faeroese fund.
 Norway has already set aside $700,000 for the Faeroese, and, to help pay for this, will increase the license fees paid by its sport and commercial salmon anglers.
 Although the accord is a masterly achievement given the social and political complexities of the salmon conservation movement, some doubts about it exist. At a meeting of the North Atlantic organization this January, both Finland and Canada objected to the principle of paying compensation annually.

Building for the Performing Arts in Smaller Cities

BYLINE: By LYN RIDDLE

DATELINE: GREENVILLE, S.C.

 BODY:
For decades, the nation's larger cities have been building performing arts centers as focuses for their cultural activities.
Now this city of 60,000 in northwestern South Carolina has become the latest in a lengthening string of smaller cities across the country -- including Homer, Alaska (pop. 3,000) -- to discover the advantages of building a performing arts center, for the economic and social as well as the cultural benefits they bring. 
 The $42 million Peace Center opened here last November on a five-acre downtown tract whose redevelopment had long been a puzzle to community leaders. The center includes a 2,100-seat concert hall, a 400-seat theater, a cabaret theater and an amphitheater beside the Reedy River.
Community leaders say they are already seeing results: Downtown restaurants, hotels, florists and other businesses have experienced a marked increase in business.
"There is an excitement that I've never really seen before," said Betty Peace Stall, a Greenville native and chairwoman of the Peace Center Foundation, which runs the complex.
Greenville is part of a metropolitan area that includes three counties -- Greenville, Spartanburg and Pickens -- with a population of 640,000.
Architects say the trend has been developing for a decade. Among the cities that have built or renovated such centers, or are doing so, to meet cultural pursuits, revitalize downtowns, attract new business and stimulate the local economy are the following:
* Boise, Idaho (pop. 116,100), together with Boise State University, built a 2,000-seat theater, a small experimental theater and a school of music on the university campus for $16 million in 1982.
* Helena, Ark. (pop. 20,000), bordering Mississippi, built a 1,200-seat theater.
* San Luis Obispo, Calif. (pop. 40,900), needing a place for its Mozart festival, will begin construction within a year on a 1,500-seat, $15 million facility on the campus of California State Polytechnic University. The private, nonprofit Foundation for the Performing Arts Center has joined the city and school as a partner.
* Chattanooga, Tenn. (pop 165,200), spent $6.5 million to renovate the 70-year-old Tivoli Theater for a 1,800-seat concert hall two years ago.
* Memphis (pop. 666,900) renovated a similar 2,500-seat downtown theater in 1984 for $5 million.
"There is a significant trend for planning and building performing arts centers," said Ron Jerit, an architect with Jerit/Boys, theater consultants in Oak Park, Ill., which worked on the Greenville complex. "But everything about this tends to be low profile. The movement is masked because you have to look in unlikely places to find it."
No one agency has kept track of the number of performing arts centers built in the last decade, but architects who specialize in this type of work say there have been hundreds. About a dozen architectural firms specialize in theater design, including S. Leonard Auerbach & Associates in San Francisco, Artec in New York City, George Thomas Howard in Hollywood and Knudson/Benson in Seattle.
Performing arts centers range from a civic center built at the high school in Homer, Alaska (population 3,000) to the arts complex built here. Typically, a performing arts center will include a concert hall that can be adapted for a variety of performers, from touring companies to guest artists, and a smaller theater for local talent. Many have space for displaying artwork as well.
Mr. Auerbach said that many performing arts centers are "town and gown" projects, sponsored by a city and a local college or university. An example is the $22 million center recently opened at Johnson County Community College in Overland Park, Kan. (pop. 104,400). The continuing education complex features a 1,400-seat multi-use theater for touring productions and the local symphony, a 400-seat dramatic arts center, a 150-seat studio and a 100-seat recital hall.
"In the past, we've found that institutions were isolated, without much outreach to the community," Mr. Auerbach said. Joint ownership allows both the city and the schools to work together to their mutual benefit and meet the needs of the community.
Some state capitals, like Nashville, Tenn. (pop. 486,900), and Columbus, Ohio (pop. 581,500), have benefited from state-run complexes. In Columbus, a four-theater complex was built across the street from the capitol. It is included in a 38-story state government office building that was planned as part of a much-needed downtown revitalization project, Mr. Auerbach said.
Here in Greenville, the massive brick complex designed by Craig, Gaulden and Davis, a local architectural firm, came to be after nearly a decade of planning and fund-raising. Mrs. Stall's family, the Peaces, who owned two local newspapers, Greenville Piedmont andThe Greenville News, and still hold a minority interest in the Multimedia Corporation -- which now owns the newspapers -- gave an initial gift of $14 million.
The hope for spinoff benefits for downtown redevelopment and economic development were as much a factor for the project as improving the cultural scene. The property on which the center was built is across the street from the newspaper building and "was a slum," Mrs. Stall said. Several buildings on the site -- a textile mill, a mayonnaise factory and a coach factory -- had long been abandoned. For several years, community leaders had envisioned using them as a museum devoted to textiles, a primary industry here.
The Peace Center architects used several of the buildings in their design. Two serve as backstage space for the largest theaters. Another was gutted for an open-air pavilion for arts displays or picnics. Yet another will be renovated for 25,000 square feet of office space to be rented out.
This week, a reception hall, the cabaret theater and a cafe will open in the former coach factory. All, it is hoped, will make profits to help offset the losses the larger halls are expected to sustain.
All performing arts centers run deficits, Mrs. Stall said. While many receive financial assistance from their cities, she said, the Peace Center will operate on its own revenues and an $8 million endowment that has been pledged but not yet been collected.
The City of Greenville, Mrs. Stall said, assembled and improved the land for the center, at a cost of $4.75 million, with the expectation that the project would stimulate interest in redeveloping the southern end of Main Street.
A half-dozen or so multistory office buildings have been built in the last five years on the northern end of downtown, and many more buildings have been renovated.
Now though, a limited partnership has bought the property across the river from the Peace Center and may build housing, stores and office space, said Ron Geyer, a principal architect with Craig, Gaulden & Davis.
Mr. Geyer also said the center will help attract businesses -- a prime concern of local leaders since the decline of the textile industry. At the turn of the century, textile mills were by far the largest employers; as recently as 1974 they accounted for 52 percent of manufacturing jobs. But since then 8,000 mill jobs have been lost and as of 1989 -- the last year for which figures are available -- there were 18,700 textile workers out of a total of 52,300 manufacturing jobs.
"If you want to go out and get a more sophisticated investor, you have to get more sophisticated amenities," said Mr. Geyer. "Infrastructure used to be a big highway and lots of water and sewer. That's O.K. for smokestack recruitment, but what folks want now is headquarters."

Housing Markets Evade Human Needs

BYLINE: By ANDI RIERDEN

 BODY:
THE housing market in Connecticut will be dominated by major shifts of population in the next 20 years that may reduce the number of first-time home buyers and make it difficult for those who now own homes to move up or out, says a new study by the State Housing Department.
By 2000, residents 25 to 34 years old, the traditional span for first-time home buyers, will decline by a quarter, the report said. During the same period, the number of people aged 35 to 44, those considered most likely to trade up to a more expensive home, is expected to grow by 22 percent. Consequently, the competition for available buyers will increase, which could cause the numbers of homes sold, along with home prices, to decline. 
 But one of the most disturbing aspects of the state's changing demographics is the growing population of residents in Connecticut's urban centers who are young, poor and struggling to find housing and jobs, said the department's director of research, Sandy Bergin, who edited the study. If this trend is ignored, she said, it could seriously alter the state's economic viability.
In an interview in her office in Hartford, Ms. Bergin discussed the details of the study and its impact on the housing market. Here are some excerpts from that conversation:
Q. How did demographics affect the 1980's housing boom?
A. During the 1980's, the housing demand was spurred by the generation of baby boomers aged 25 to 44 who were moving into the market all at the same time. Just as baby boomers displaced every other institution they came in contact with, from education to the labor force, so too did they have a tremendous impact on housing demands, especially the demand for new rental units and first-time entry-level housing. Subsequently, this caused supply to lag behind demand. As a result, housing prices escalated.
Q. How will this affect the trade-up market in the 1990's?
A. The boomers who got into the home purchase market in the late 1970's and early 80's are now considered to be in their peak earning years and ready to buy larger or more expensive homes. The problem is it's very difficult to sell the entry-level homes that they now live in. One reason for this is the fact that the number of 24- to 34-year-olds is expected to drop by 24 percent, and they are traditionally the first-home buying group. Because there are simply fewer of them, that may cause a decrease in demand for existing housing.
Q. Are there any factors that could change that?
A. It could be offset, because housing ownership rates in this age group have been lower during the 1980's, due to the very high prices of homes in Connecticut. If prices fall as a result of less demand, this will benefit younger boomers and other purchasers who have been shut out of the home purchase market.
Q. According to the study, the number of residents 85 and older will increase nearly 30 percent in the next 20 years. How will this impact housing trends?
A. This age group has a very high income ownership rate. Many of these people, though, need some assistance in daily living and may wish to move out of their homes into nursing homes or congregate facilities, which offer medical services on site. State and housing industries should certainly become concerned about building more housing for this age group, which will become larger and larger as time goes by.
Q. During the 1980's how did income levels shift?
A. Those in the lowest 20 percent of incomes got poorer, and those in the upper 20 percent very much got wealthier. The gap between the wealthy and poor in Connecticut is probably greater than it is in any other state. We have the highest per capita income in the nation, and our cities are among the most distressed in the nation. This disparity between these two Connecticuts is very disturbing.
Q. How has the demographic makeup of the state's cities and suburban areas changed?
A. We found that the suburban communities are growing much older than the urban centers, simply because the suburbs are made up of predominantly white non-Hispanic residents who are not having children at the same rate as Hispanic and black residents. In addition, the minority populations are growing younger and poorer and are remaining in the cities.
We try to make it clear that there is not an absolute identity between groups and poverty in racial and ethnic groups. But it's important to recognize that minorities in Connecticut are very much overrepresented among the very poor and among people who need assistance.
Q. Which households are most adversely affected by the changing demographics?
A. Because of the divorce rate and other factors, there has been a sharp rise in the number of single-parent female-headed families. They are disproportionately found among the groups in poverty in Connecticut. We found that 26 percent of all female-headed households headed by women aged 18 to 64 were living below the poverty line. And 40 percent of black and Hispanic female-headed households in this age group were living below the poverty line. As a consequence, there are a sizable number of families that cannot afford home ownership and probably won't be able to.
Because they are poor, they are renters of subsidized housing when they can find it. When they cannot, they pay an extraordinary amount of their income for shelter costs. Many of these families are on Aid to Families With Dependent Children and those payments may in no way keep up with the rise in rents.
For example, if families in poverty were renting a two-bedroom apartment at 30 percent of their grant, it would take a grant that was 205 percent higher in order to afford that rent.
Q. How big a role will the Federal Government play in the area of housing during the 1990's?
A. Certainly during the 1980's, when the Federal Government was almost totally removed from any activity in the housing field, states and localities had to pick up the tab, and there is no way they could completely do that.
The Feds are now getting back into the housing arena with the National Affordable Housing Act. And even though that won't provide a tremendous amount of additional dollars, it is certainly welcome by states with deficits like Connecticut.
Q. What's been the response from suburban communities toward affordable housing?
A. It varies from community to community. Some are open to affordable housing, not only as a way for their own children to stay in the area but also because they realize that to make a real community you need people of all income backgrounds and racial and ethnic backgrounds. That awareness, however, is not all-pervasive.
There is a degree of this "not in my backyard" attitude that we hope will begin to erode. One of the difficulties we face is the fear some folks have that affordable housing means high-rises or bleak public housing occupied by extremely poverty-stricken people who have all kinds of problems and are prey to criminals and drug-pushing. However, we don't build like that anymore. We understand that to crowd very poor people into one complex is a terrible thing.
Affordable housing in the 1990's will be for people with mixed incomes, middle class, poor, white and black people, families and nonfamilies. We're not talking about big projects. We're talking about a duplex here, a fourplex there, scattered sites that have attractive houses on them.
Q. How will a limited amount of affordable housing impact Connecticut residents?
A. If the patterns we have seen in Connecticut continue unabated, we will see even greater segregation by income and by race and by class. This will not be good for people who live in the central cities nor for people in the suburbs.
If the suburbs do not allow affordable housing to be built there, young people will leave, because they simply cannot afford to live there. Residents won't be able to maintain a labor force that will allow them the quality of life that they presumably are trying to protect by trying to keep certain kinds of people out.
Q. Though there are no statewide figures on the high school dropout rate, your study reported that the attrition rate among black students was 38 percent and among Hispanic students was 50 percent.
A. Yes, and that's a great concern to the business community. One of the reasons why the attrition rate is so high among Hispanics is probably because there is a lot of moving back and forth between the mainland and Puerto Rico. It could be that they finish high school there. However, these rates are still alarming, and the impact on Connecticut will be tremendous if large numbers of new workers that we need to sustain our industries do not have a high school education.
Q. The study was based primarily on the 1980 Census figures and available updated data. Why didn't you wait until the 1990 Census figures came in to do this report?
A. We decided that we couldn't wait until all the census information came out, which won't be until 1993. We needed to alert the housing industry to the political issues that we think are implicit in this report.
We wanted to alert people to the fact that these are the trends, and if they are left alone without being recognized, they could have a real negative impact on the quality of life in Connecticut. We're hoping that actions can be taken now to modify the negative trends and accentuate the positive.
Q. Now that some of the 1990 Census figures are beginning to trickle in, are they verifying projections made in the study?
A. One of the things we've seen from the 1990 figures is that Hartford is now the first city in Connecticut in which white non-Hispanic residents do not make up the majority population. So indeed, that coincides with the trend that we saw when we did the study that the cities are growing increasingly with residents from other racial and ethnic minority populations.

HEADLINE: Pattern of Change in Eastern Towns Shows How Highways Lead to Growth

BYLINE: By ROBERT A. HAMILTON

 BODY:
MAPPING eastern Connecticut by population shows three clear clusters of major growth during the 1980's, all suburban or rural towns along major highways, according to data from the 1990 Census.
"That's almost the classic example of how population trends are linked to the existence or improvement of transportation networks," said James G. Palma Jr., a planning supervisor with the Connecticut Census Data Center. 
 "Traffic planners always debate which came first, the highway or the need for the highway?" Mr. Palma said. "And the answer is, it's cyclical. Population movements tend to create demand for the highway. Then when the highway is built, it creates an even greater population movement."
One of the clusters of growth -- including Salem and Colchester, the towns that grew fastest in the state -- was along the corrdidor of Routes 2 and 11, extending southeast from Hartford and taking in East Haddam, Hebron, Columbia, Marlborough and Lebanon.
 
Towns Remain Rural
 Another growth cluster was along Interstate 84, extending northeast from Hartford through Bolton, Andover, Manchester, Vernon, South Windsor, Stafford, Willington, Woodstock and Eastford.
A third, smaller cluster -- Plainfield, Sterling, Canterbury, Brooklyn and Voluntown -- is along Interstate 395, a north-south route from the coast to the Massachusetts border.
Despite the growth, most of the towns remain rural, like Sterling, where town officials note that there are still no traffic lights or McDonald's restaurants.
In Sterling, which ended the decade with a population of 2,357, up 32 percent, the economic development coordinator, Trenton E. Wright, said a lot of people who work at Electric Boat in Groton or in towns over the Massachusetts border find the area near Interstate 395 attractive.
"You can come out here and get four acres and a three-bedroom house for $125,000," Mr. Wright said. "There's not a lot of places left in Connecticut where you can say that."
 
Decline in Cities
 But the explosive growth has meant some problems, including crowded schools and roads.
"You never recover enough taxes on a home to pay for the cost of education," Mr. Wright said. "If it continues like this, it's going to be a tremendous burden on the town, providing services."
Of 58 towns in the state east of the Connecticut River, 35 grew at a pace more than double the state's 5.8 percent population growth in the 1980's, and 11 grew at more than five times the average, the Census found.
But all the growth was in rural and suburban towns. The area's cities, New London and Norwich, continued a 30-year decline in population and now rank behind well-developed suburbs like Groton and Enfield. Elsewhere in the state, four of the five major cities showed population increases during the decade.
Salem and Colchester, two towns in the Routes 2 and 11 corridor that were largely farming communities even 10 years ago, saw the state's most explosive growth in the 1980's, 41.8 and 41.5 percent, respectively.
Debbie Delaney, owner of Mind Your Business, a bookkeeping company in Salem, moved to the town six years ago from Trumbull. The price and availability of land has made the town so attractive, she said.
"You can get a house with five acres of land here, or a 50-by 100-foot lot in Trumbull," Ms. Delaney said. "Then, when you start with a population of only 2,100, there's no place but up. The growth is inevitable."
Despite the growth, Salem, which still had only 3,310 people at the time of the Census last year, has retained its small-town charm, she said.
"Quaint doesn't really describe this town," Ms. Delaney said. "Unknown is probably a better term. People ask, 'Salem, Conn.?' A lot of our mail ends up in Massachusetts."
Salem's First Selectman, Hugh C. Teel, said, "We've become a community of dual-professional families, where one works in Hartford and the other works in New London, and it's an easy commute for both of them from here."
But the growth has caused some problems, Mr. Teel said. The town is engaged in a battle over whether to spend $5.25 million to expand its school, something that will add about $50 to the average homeowner's tax bill. The town landfill, which officials had expected to last for many years, will now hold out perhaps six or eight years, with proper management.
Mr. Teel predicted even greater growth for the town when Route 11 is completed. The limited-access highway now connects Route 2 to two local highways, Routes 82 and 85, in Salem, creating a bottleneck. Eventually Route 11 will be built south to Interstate 95, with exits in Salem.
"The traffic going southbound, particularly in the summer, is just phenomenal," Mr. Teel said. "There are a lot of businesses that would like to be on Route 85 but won't locate there right now, because the road is so congested."
 
600 New Condominium Units
 Colchester, which ended the decade with a population of 10,980, probably would have grown even faster than its increase of nearly 42 percent except for a moratorium on water hookups in its two-square-mile town center, said N. Reed Gustafson, the town's zoning agent, sanitarian, fire marshal and civil preparedness director.
The moratorium was put in place because of contamination in one of the town wells, he said, but equipment to clean up the water is expected to be in place by this summer.
"As soon as that moratorium is lifted, there's about 600 condominium units that are going to be built, or so I am told," Mr. Gustafson said. "I think you'd have to be crazy to build a condominium in this market. But we're still getting three or four applications a week for new construction, which makes us the busiest town in New London County."
Nine of the 11 towns covered by the Windham Regional Planning Agency saw above-average growth in the 1980's, said the agency's executive director, Margaret P. Reich. The trend toward the suburbs was not surprising, she said, because dozens of large farms went out of business and were subdivided for housing during the 1980's.
But the numbers have to be considered carefully, Ms. Reich said. "When you're only starting with a population of 1,700 people or so, if you add only 20 people that's more than a 1 percent growth," she said.
Mansfield seemed to grow only 2.3 percent during the 1980's, to 21,103 people, but that included the loss of almost 700 retarded people who had been residents of the Mansfield Training School until the state embarked on a program of moving people out of institutions, Ms. Reich said.
 
Transitional Places to Live
 The Census found that New London's population dropped 1 percent in the 1980's, to 28,540, and Norwich's dropped 1.8 percent, to 37,391. East Hartford, which is east of the river but usually considered part of central Connecticut, also showed a drop, of 4 percent, to 50,542.
Mr. Palma noted that the cities would have had to spend huge amounts of money on sewers, roads and other infrastructure to accommodate even a small percentage of growth.
In addition, he said, cities tend to be transitional places to live. East Hartford, Norwich, New London and other cities, have large amounts of rental housing, and until 1980, a lot of their units were occupied by baby boomers who were starting families.
"During the decade, the wage earners in a lot of those families got promotions," Mr. Palma said, "and they wanted to buy their own house. Some of them might have moved to their own house in East Hartford, but more of them probably looked down Route 2 to Hebron and Colchester, where the land is more available and affordable."
As the families moved out of the rental units, Mr. Palma said, many were occupied by single people, or one-parent families, so the population decreased even as the number of housing units increased.
"Why any town grows, or doesn't grow, is usually due to about 10 different reasons," Mr. Palma said. "But most frequently, it's a matter of where people want to live. And what these numbers say is people in eastern Connecticut in the 1980's wanted to live in the suburbs."

THE ART OF CARTOGRAPHY
By J. S. Marcus.
129 pp. New York:
Alfred A. Knopf. $18. 
 Imagine a fortune-cookie writer with a highly developed sense of irony, a need to get some ideas across and a modicum of experience in the worlds of film, fashion and graduate school. You'd get someone a lot like J. S. Marcus, at least what you can see of him in "The Art of Cartography," his first collection of short stories. Like cookie fortunes, Mr. Marcus's stories are not necessarily untrue. Sometimes they're even apt. They're just not as deep as this clearly talented writer could make them.
Here are some of the fortunes in his cookies: "There is a difference between the presence of pleasure and the absence of pain; between flourishing and surviving; between there and then, and here and now." Or: "Physically, economically, politically, nobody wants to be in the middle, and everybody wants to be on the edge." Or: "In a way, nothing turns out to be what you think it is."
Aphorisms like these, and the tendency to substitute clever observation for thoughtful writing, make "The Art of Cartography" seem insufficient. ("Francine lives in a house across the street from Kew Gardens, and the man living above her breeds guinea pigs. She is working on a screenplay about a writer from Pennsylvania who comes to London and lives on top of a couple who breed guinea pigs.") This is not to say that there isn't some good writing here, because there is, along with some real intelligence. Just not enough.
Mr. Marcus holds up the life of people in their 20's (a startlingly unsettling time for many, as it happens) and examines it from several angles; he finds struggle, aimlessness, detachment, loneliness. But no single character stands out: whether it's a young woman who drops out of law school and follows an ex-boyfriend to Los Angeles, a young man who travels around the world as a film production assistant or a young American in a bank-training program in London, there's a sameness to these people. They could all be friends, certainly, or at least all have friends in common. Better yet, they could all be characters in a novel together.
And I'd look forward to a novel by Mr. Marcus; for one thing, there'd be a chance for his work to show some real development and continuity. For another, maybe he'd come closer to answering some of the important questions -- about place and belonging and movement -- that echo throughout this book of stories with names like "Home," "Leaving," "Everywhere," "Apart." After all, as he himself writes in the title story, "The old answers and the old questions are best, but people still want the most for their money."
Even broaching the questions is a good thing, though. For Mr. Marcus does know something about the life of a certain kind of person in his or her 20's, about how that period shifts from being a time of alienation to a time of freedom and back in just moments: "In the lives of those people," thinks one character of herself and her friends, "there are sudden and overwhelming desires to slow down -- to stop, if necessary -- before everything changes into something else, something different, unrecognizable, and lost."
But this same woman acknowledges in a later story, after she's left law school and returned to her old boyfriend, "How heavy we seemed, Everett and I, back where we began, but not exactly, as if all we could do in our lives was shift weight. We began to talk about Los Angeles and laugh. . . . There was a sudden lightness, a grace, in our joking, in our rhetoric."
J. S. Marcus gets all sorts of things right. If only he weren't quite so glib.

BRINGING DOWN THE GREAT WALL
Writings on Science, Culture, and Democracy in China.
By Fang Lizhi.
Edited by James H. Williams.
Translated by James H. Williams and others.
Introduction by Orville Schell.
336 pp. New York:
Alfred A. Knopf. $19.95.  
 Fang Lizhi, the Chinese dissident, likes sometimes to present himself as the very model of the absent-minded intellectual, a man so wrapped up in his own thoughts that he has little consciousness of the world around him. In middle school, he tells us in "Bringing Down the Great Wall," a moving collection of his essays, interviews and speeches, "I was so absorbed with the daydreams that my teachers aroused in me there that at times I would walk right into utility poles on the side of the road." But he at once adds a gloss to this fairly conventional metaphor, one that shows the mischievous and pragmatic side of his character: "So hard did I bump into them, in fact, that I can still remember the numbers that were written on those poles." It is not the pain he wants us to know he remembers, but the numbers.
As one of China's leading scientists, first in astrophysics and later in cosmology, Mr. Fang is very good indeed both at dreaming and at remembering the numbers. But as an incorrigible freethinker, who has seen with mounting anguish the hopeless state into which Chinese society is drifting, Mr. Fang also has become an accomplished expert at deliberately walking into immovable objects -- in this case, the hard-liners in the upper echelons of the Communist Party's political and educational bureaucracies.
Fang Lizhi is now one of China's best-known dissidents. He was accused by the Chinese Government of being one of the ringleaders of the huge spring 1989 demonstrations in Tiananmen Square; and, after the mass slaughter of civilians in Beijing on June 4 by the People's Liberation Army, he and his wife sought shelter in the United States Embassy. Allowed to leave the country in the summer of 1990, he has since received academic sanctuary in Cambridge University and in Princeton.
Mr. Fang's popularity and notoriety have been due in part to his visibility: as an internationally prominent scientist and the vice president of the important University of Science and Technology at Hefei in Anhui Province, he was at the forefront of those trying to train China's youth to participate successfully in the front ranks of the international scientific community. Mr. Fang has also got attention because he has been through a lot: he was purged and deprived of his Communist Party membership in the antirightist campaign of 1957 for his outspoken critique of the sterility of Communist party discussions; he was rehabilitated in 1978, after the Cultural Revolution; he was deprived once more of his party membership in early 1987, as the hard-liners struck back against the late 1986 student demonstrations; and he brought the Government's anger down on himself again in January 1989 when he appealed to the Party to release Wei Jingsheng, the foremost protester of China's long-crushed democracy movement of 1978, who had by then spent 10 years in jail. But, above all, Fang Lizhi has been listened to because he is witty, passionate, tenacious and articulate. Students have loved his speeches; whether he had prepared carefully or spoke off the cuff, he could hold an audience in the palm of his hand.
The rhythms of Mr. Fang's life as a highly visible protester against his Government's stupidity, greed and cruelty have inevitably led to his being compared to Andrei Sakharov in the Soviet Union and to Vaclav Havel in Czechoslovakia. But in various interviews Mr. Fang has always dodged all parallels with Sakharov, and has explicitly rejected those to Mr. Havel. He emphatically denies that he is a political leader and insists that he does not want to be one. It is one of the weaknesses of China, he explains, that the Chinese reject one leader only to submit themselves to another. It would be far better, he says, for the Chinese "to learn that democracy requires a confrontation of ideas and not a leader who says one thing and everybody follows. . . . If the Chinese people are expecting the appearance of a hero, it had better not be me. This expectation in itself is very unhealthy."
In "Bringing Down the Great Wall," James H. Williams, a scholar on science and technology in China, and a few of his colleagues have translated and compiled an admirably comprehensive selection of Fang Lizhi's written and spoken words,focusing on his works since 1979 and ending with some of the pieces he wrote after being allowed to leave China in 1990. Mr. Fang's writings are divided into sections corresponding to what they see as four sides of his nature: the cosmologist, the cosmopolitan, the democrat and the dissident. The translations are fluent, and the introductions to each section, along with Orville Schell's long introduction to the book as a whole, are intelligent and pertinent. The Fang Lizhi who is thus introduced to us is humane in an immediately accessible way: decent, courageous, sometimes evasive, sometimes sarcastic, urbane yet emotional, a socialist and an elitist, opinionated and impatient of official cant.
Readers today are likely to have trouble remembering just how "unsayable" so many of Fang Lizhi's thoughts were in the contexts in which he uttered them. His courage is thus not obvious to an outsider. The fervor of the students' responses came from the fact that they had never heard such words before, certainly not from a senior figure in the establishment. As Mr. Fang says in a beautiful essay, "The End of Forgetting History," this does not mean such things had not ever been said in China -- they had been said spiritedly in 1957 and in 1978 -- but the Chinese state had erased them from the record, replacing the vanished voices with a void that could be filled only with whispers.
In the mid-1980's, as Mr. Fang hit his stride as a social critic, a host of other Chinese were also trying to give their own versions of truth, not just in essays and speeches but also in films and paintings, novels and poems. But whereas most of them chose to be indirect to some extent, there was little that was indirect about Mr. Fang. He suggested to his audiences that the best global parallels for China were to be found in the zealotry of Iran, the economic stagnation of Poland and the terrible poverty of Chad; he told them "Marxism has become ossified," that the Government's habit of continually shifting its policies was "an infantile way of running an economy," and that the philosophical pronouncements from the Office of National Dialectics in the Chinese Academy of Social Science merely perpetuated "the image of a Chinaman with a long pigtail, clad in a Western suit."
During the 1980's, Deng Xiaoping and the Chinese Communist Party were trying to make people subscribe to the "Four Upholds," : the Socialist road, the dictatorship of the proletariat, Communist Party leadership and the leading role of "Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought." Mr. Fang countered these by saying that he believed a university should have its own four upholds: "a spirit of science, democracy, creativity, and independence." Told by a reporter that his four upholds" might be seen as "a little dangerous," Mr. Fang replied that perhaps he could clarify things by relating his four upholds to what the Government's four really referred to -- namely, superstition, dictatorship, conservatism and dependency. To give some idea of Mr. Fang's bravado, this particular speech was delivered to about 3,000 students and faculty at Tongzhi University in Shanghai in November 1986.
Commentators on China's various democracy movements, those of 1978, 1986 or 1989, have stated that there never seems to be any content to Chinese discussions of democracy, and that this makes the whole movement seem elusive. Mr. Fang, however, has offered frequent, crisp and intelligent analyses of what he means by democracy -- definitions that even those comfortably raised within such democracies might find hard to improve upon. Democracy, Mr. Fang told his Chinese audiences, means genuine pluralism rather than personalized attacks on the opposition; it means controlling corruption through public scrutiny and accountability; it means upholding the right to complain about injustice of all kinds; it means supporting the fundamental idea of shared human rights; it means governmental responsibility to its citizens; it means not relying on informers and not taking punitive action on the basis of casual suspicions; and it means refusing to quote as wisdom the observations of political leaders who know nothing.
Chinese and foreign journalists and Mr. Fang's student audiences have often asked how such values might be introduced into China. Mr. Fang has no easy answers. Perhaps change could come from within even if the external structures of government remain the same, he suggests, illustrating his point by using the words of a homely traditional Chinese metaphor: "In front of the shop the sheep's head keeps dangling, but inside the shop one sells dog meat." But, he says, before that happens the people must make it clear to the party that they want change. And that will not be easy, since the Chinese, unsure about what to do, are "like a swarm of headless flies, buzzing around in every direction."
But Mr. Fang suggests two ways out of this box. First, it is possible that the Government, faced with the strength and determination of the democracy movement in China and abroad, might be forced to change constructively, "just as a bandit gives in when he meets a stronger force." Secondly, it is possible that current global changes themselves might force the issue: "The greenhouse effect, the population explosion, are issues that cannot be solved without a global solution. If China cannot catch up with the rest of the world, the world will make China catch up with it."
Fang Lizhi may reject comparisons between himself and Andrei Sakharov or Vaclav Havel, but others will continue to make those comparisons for him. As Mr. Williams succinctly puts it in his introduction to one of the sections of this moving and intelligently orchestrated collection, Mr. Fang's great skill is that, "like Sakharov in the Soviet Union, he used the prestige of science to ferry ideas from beyond the margins of political permissibility into the general discourse on reform." We might supplement that comment with an idea that Mr. Havel expressed in his books "Disturbing the Peace" and "Letters to Olga": in the grim world of Communist dictatorship, where optimism seems too facile an idea, there is always a deeper force, something we can term "hope." Hope to Mr. Havel is the power that enables us to keep alive the belief that one day things will again make sense. This making sense of experience is one of the things that gives us courage as we pursue what Mr. Havel calls our "entirely obscure task" on this planet. Mr. Fang, this book shows, has the mental strength to keep that hope alive and to maintain the faith that one day all that he, his contemporaries and his country have gone through during the last half-century will somehow make sense. On the day that happens, the Great Wall will truly come down.
 
 
 
INTELLECTUALS UP FRONT

"For the democracy movement, of course, China needs leaders," said Fang Lizhi, the Chinese astrophysicist and dissident, during a telephone interview from the University of Louisville, in Kentucky, where he was visiting. Yet Mr. Fang refuses to be considered one of those leaders. "I do not like that job," he replied rather wearily. "I like teaching and telling people things. I'm a sparrow leader."
What Mr. Fang calls a sparrow, Americans call a gadfly. Indeed, it was Mr. Fang's outspokenness that forced him to seek refuge in the United States Embassy in Beijing before going into exile. He is now working on the topology of the universe at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, N.J.
Mr. Fang may not hope to govern, but he does believe intellectuals belong at the forefront of any functioning democracy -- quite the opposite of the situation in China. There, he said, "the party's first, the intellectuals last."
Mr. Fang assembled his speeches, letters and essays in "Bringing Down the Great Wall" so they would be on hand for debate. The first step toward reform, he said, is freedom of speech and freedom of the press. But how, aside from the book, does he hope to contribute to the conversation about China while living in New Jersey? "It's difficult," he said. "I am quite far from China. I have joined the Chinese students, I have joined some international organizations for human rights. I can still do something, but it is limited, obviously, to the issue of human rights." -- JUDITH SHULEVITZ

HEADLINE: Treasury Plan Takes Chains Off Banks

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Leonard Silk's April 5 Economic Scene column, "Giving the Banks Greater Powers," addresses critical reforms to the nation's financial services industry, but is misleading on the adequacy of the Administration's proposals.
Restoring safety to our banking system requires tough new rules governing capital adequacy and deposit insurance premiums, as well as improved accounting rules, earlier problem resolution and more frequent inspections by regulators. The column implies these are not covered by the Administration's bill. On the contrary, the Treasury plan includes strong provisions closely mirroring each of the General Accounting Office recommendations mentioned in the column. 
 A stronger banking system also requires capital from new sources. One aim of Treasury's proposal is to attract well-capitalized competitors, who have been prevented from competing with banks.
For decades, well-capitalized companies have been barred from affiliating with banks. This hurts consumers, taxpayers and the banking system itself. The Treasury proposal is designed to eliminate these outdated and costly restrictions on affiliations -- not to expand bank powers.
The column implies that the plan might permit banks with weak capital positions to enter new businesses and -- worse still -- that there would be no firewalls to insulate insured deposits (that is, taxpayers) from risky activities. The Treasury plan explicitly excludes all but the best-capitalized banks from new financial activities.
For too long Congress has debated limited reforms aimed at symptoms, instead of in-depth solutions to the underlying problems in our banking system. The erosion of efficiency, customer service and profitability are the result. This is a disservice to households and businesses, exposes taxpayers to needless risk and yields glaring competitive inequities.
Congress needs to act now to modernize laws governing our financial services industry both to reflect market changes and to restore safety and soundness to America's banking system.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: Publishing;
For Some, Best Prose Is in Blurbs

BYLINE: By EDWIN McDOWELL

 BODY:
SIMON & SCHUSTER is apparently still deciding whether to publish "Just Killing Time," a novel by Derek V. Goodwin that was submitted with phony endorsements, or blurbs, from John le Carre and Joseph Wambaugh. Whatever is decided, one thing is sure: The "blurb industry," as some publishing executives call it, is recession-proof and is here to stay.
Few books appear without at least one testimonial to their value or to the skill of their authors. No matter that many blurbs on book jackets and in advertisements amount to literary backscratching, in that they are written by friends of the author, the agent or the editor. They serve their purpose if they call attention to a particular book in a very crowded field. 
 "When 55,000 books are published each year, you are desperate for ways to distinguish your books from everybody else's," said Paul Gottlieb, president of Harry N. Abrams Inc. "The right person writing a blurb for the right audience can sometimes make a tremendous difference in sales."
The conventional, though unproved, wisdom is that blurbs can turn undecided readers into buyers. "But there's a presumption among the marketing people that they're especially important for the sales reps and booksellers," said Donald I. Fine, the president of Donald I. Fine Inc.
When he was head of Arbor House a few years ago, Mr. Fine published in hardcover "The City Primeval" by Elmore Leonard, then a relatively unknown author of paperbacks. He sent galleys to John D. MacDonald, soliciting a blurb. Mr. Fine recalled, "MacDonald called me and asked, 'Who is that guy? He's teriffic,' and we used that line in our advertising."
Novelists are said to be more generous about giving blurbs than are writers of nonfiction, many of whom are specialists and some of whom are careful not to bolster the reputation of real or imagined rivals. "Fiction writers who have struggled, and writers of such genres as mysteries and science fiction, tend to enjoy helping other writers," said Kent Carroll, publisher of Carroll & Graf Publishers Inc.
Even well-established literary writers are often willing to provide a helping hand. William Least Heat-Moon attributes much of the success of his 1983 best seller, "Blue Highways," to Robert Penn Warren, who called it "a masterpiece." That blurb, by the winner of Pulitzer Prizes for both fiction and poetry, adorned the book's jacket.
And the reputation in the United States of the Italian writer and chemist Primo Levi owes much to Saul Bellow, whose memorable blurb -- "This is the book it is necessary to read next" -- adorned the jacket of "The Periodic Table" by Mr. Levi, published by Schocken Books in 1984.
But blurbs can backfire. "Hyperbolic blurbs on a book that doesn't measure up create as much skepticism as giving four stars to a mediocre restaurant," said Fred W. Hills, a senior editor of Simon & Schuster.
One book reviewer, who insisted that he not be identified, said he saw blurbs in a negative light. "The enthusiasm in most blurbs," he said, "is probably a gauge of the blurb writer's relief that the book he's endorsing is inferior to anything he can write."
Still, certain blurbs are likely to make even reviewers take notice. "I try to get blurbs from people who don't usually blurb," said Ann Godoff, the editor in chief of the Atlantic Monthly Press. She did just that when she elicited a blurb from Graham Greene for "The Hidden War" by Artyom Borovik, a Russian journalist. Printed on the jacket, the quote declares: "I've read no other account of the war in Afghanistan equal to this . . . This is literature, not journalism."
Publishers usually cast as wide a net as possible for blurbs. Thus, the back jacket of "The Prize" by Daniel Yergen consists entirely of blurbs from such authors, scholars and media personalities as John Chancellor, Simon Schama, James Schlesinger, Doris Kearns Goodwin, Theodore Levitt and Paul A. Samuelson.
Even blurbs by relative unknowns can help in certain situations. "If it's the right quote," said Alan D. Williams, the publisher of Grove Weidenfeld, "it can make you feel guilty for not knowing who it is."
Blurbs by literary writers are likely to be of little help in promoting romance novels or self-help and diet books. When William Morrow & Company published "Swim With the Sharks" by Harvey Mackay a few years ago, a book about motivation and negotiating, it ran an ad with blurbs from Ted Koppel, Walter F. Mondale, Gloria Steinem, Fran Tarkington, Gerald R. Ford, Robert Redford, Billy Graham, Gov. Mario Cuomo, Norman Vincent Peale and 18 others.
Of course, whoever chose the spurious blurbs by Mr. le Carre and Mr. Wambaugh for "Just Killing Time" knew enough about publishing and book buying to know that the imprimatur of both men, who give blurbs infrequently, would greatly enhance the book's value by appealing to the audiences of both authors.
Some publishers have even demanded that authors deliver blurbs from established writers, in return for advertising the book. But almost no one is more cynical about blurbs than publishing people themselves.
"If you're trying to sell paperback reprint rights to one of your books," Mr. Carroll said, "and you have teriffic reviews from The New York Times, The New Yorker or The New York Review of Books, reprinters are interested. But if I sent a sheet of blurbs from six important writers, they'd come back and say why did you send me this?"

 "Marvelous - funny and wry and full of behind-the-scenes Hollywood lore." -- Liz Smith on "I'll Think About That Tomorrow"
 "For anyone who has experienced cancer in the family, this valuable book tells you all you need to know. It is a godsend!" -- Luciano Pavarotti on "Everyone's Guide to Cancer Therapy"
 "Daniel Yergin has brilliantly produced a road map that shows us where we've been and where we're going as the world heads into the uncertain landscape of the 1990's. 'The Prize's should be read by everyone who wants to know why nations struggle over the control of oil resources." -- John Chancellor on "The Prize"

HEADLINE: First Fall in Net At 3M Since '85

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: CHICAGO, April 21

 BODY:
The Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing Company, the Scotch tape and abrasives maker known as 3M, has reported its first drop in quarterly profits since 1985. It attributed the decline to the sluggish world economy.
The company said its first- quarter net income fell 11 percent, to $300 million, compared with $335 million in last year's first quarter. The earnings were equal to $1.37 a share, down from $1.51 a year earlier. Sales rose to $3.39 billion from $3.16 billion. 
 "A decline in U.S. economic activity and slower growth abroad held back demand in many 3M product lines," Allen Jacobson, the company's chairman, said on Friday. The company added that its earnings outlook for the rest of the year was uncertain.
The company said a sharp downturn in its Brazilian business hurt earnings in the quarter, while United States sales rose about 2 percent from the 1990 period. Overseas, sales rose a modest 5 percent, ending a string of 12 consecutive quarters of double-digit gains.

HEADLINE: Gloomy Season on Farms as Dip in Profits Is Seen

BYLINE: By WILLIAM ROBBINS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: KANSAS CITY, Mo., April 21

 BODY:
A new mood has settled over the nation's farming regions: a sense of concern at predictions by agricultural economists of a drop in farm profits.
It is a sharp contrast to the outlook of just a year ago. Then, farmers were preparing to plant their first crops of the 1990's with an exuberance born of three years of recovery, and last season did not disappoint them. Harvests were good, livestock profits thrived and the farmers enjoyed yet another year of record income, the third in the last four. 
 But as 1990 ended, a cloud was already looming on the horizon. Grain prices were falling and Congress was preparing to cut farm subsidies.
Now it is planting time again, and while no one is expecting a replay of the farm crisis of the mid-1980's, most experts are predicting a drop of 5 to 10 percent in agricultural profits. That would mean the difference between money taken in by farmers and the expenses they paid out, their net cash income, was about $55 billion. Such a performance would still be substantially above the $36.6 billion farmers made in 1984 in the depth of the farm recession, but a noticeable drop from last year's $58 billion.
 
Split Farm Personality
 This year, as often happens, American agriculture is showing a split personality. Bearing the brunt of the downturn are grain farmers like Darwin McCall, who grows wheat near Salina, Kan. More fortunate are diversified producers like E. W. Dixon, who raises hogs anf grows the corn to feed them on his farm near Turney, Mo., about 40 miles north of Kansas City, and Lawrence Gladbach of Mendon, Mo., who raises cattle and hogs and grows grain.
Grain prices are down, with wheat expected to average about $1 a bushel less than last year's prices, which averaged $3.72 a bushel. Government subsidies will make up part of that loss, but those have now been cut. The prices that producers receive for livestock have been good for several years, and any decline is considered likely to be small.
"It looks like we'll get a decent crop," Mr. McCall said. "That's the good part. But prices, that's the bad part. It doesn't look like we'll get much for it."
Mr. Gladbach said: "Thank God for the cattle and hogs. If we had to depend on wheat and corn this year we'd be out of luck."
Unlike the recession of the mid-1980's, there is little about this year's downward drift in their fortune's that is of the farmers' own making. The farm recession was largely the aftermath of excesses in farmers' borrowing and spending, often to buy more land and equipment, stimulated by a decade of expanding exports and growing income. When foreign demand slipped and a downturn came, many of those farmers found themselves loaded with debts and trying to make a living on land bought at impractically high prices.
Since then, farmers who survived have pursued austere borrowing and spending practices. They have steadily reduced their debts so that, as Mark Drabenstott, vice president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, noted the other day, they are now better able to weather a setback than they have been in many years.
"With a conservatism born of the farm crisis, farmers have kept their debts well in hand," Mr. Drabenstott said. "Agriculture has put its financial house in order. Now if the farm bankers have a problem it is finding more borrowers, not in collecting on their loans."
The expected downturn, Mr. Drabenstott and others said, is most likely to be largely a result of world developments and Government actions. With 1985 legislation, the Government spent its way out of the farm recession, raising farm income with big Federal payments and promoting exports with subsidies.
 
8% Cut Seen in U.S. Payments
 But wheat crops elsewhere in the world were so good last year that they have dashed prospects for exports. Many farmers are now using surplus wheat, normally a food for people, to feed their livestock. This practice has dampened demand and prices for corn and other feed grains for livestock.
Another big blow to many farmers is a result of the Federal budget deficit. Their Federal subsidies have been cut by 1990 farm legislation and by the deficit-cutting budget measure.
Direct Government payments to producers of major crops like grains and cotton, which often account for most of a farm's profits, are expected to drop about 8 percent, says Gregory Gajewski, economics editor of the Agriculture Department's magazine, Agricultural Outlook.
The livestock side of the farm economy, on the other hand, is healthier. Mr. Gladbach, for instance, sold cattle the other day for more than $80 per hundred pounds, a level he could only dream about a few years ago when the same animals would have brought a little more than $50 a hundredweight.
Those prices, as well as the record prices consumers have been paying for beef, have largely been a result of restraint by farmers, who cut the size of the national herd for years and now have only gradually begun to expand.
Hog growers have also kept their production in check and their prices higher. The increases in red-meat prices have, in turn, stimulated demand for broiler chickens, so that increased consumption has helped offset the price-dampening effects of expanded poultry production.
The livestock picture is further enhanced by the reduced cost of the grains needed to feed the animals.
Such contrasts extend beyond the Middle West and the grains and animals its farmers produce. While West Coast farmers, despite recent rains, are still feeling the effects of a long drought, many farmers in the Southeast have been hard hit by flooding.
And while dry weather has blighted fields of winter wheat in northern Texas, northwest Oklahoma, western Kansas and parts of Nebraska, there are farmers like Mr. Dixon and Mr. Gladbach in the Corn Belt who are waiting for waterlogged fields to dry before they can plant.
While grain producers complain about sinking prices, cotton growers in the South are planting with renewed hope, expecting higher prices as a result of strong demand overseas and tight foreign supplies. And as producers of meat animals enjoy high prices, dairy farmers are complaining. After the price of milk they sold to processors climbed 12 percent last year amid fears of scarcity, they have now seen the price plummet 24 percent. Retail prices have slowly followed.
The sum of all these differences, said Mr. Drabenstott of the Federal Reserve Bank, is this: "We're going to see a slowdown in the farm recovery. And though livestock will help bolster many farmers' income, you can expect a 5 to 10 percent drop over all in farm profits."

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Optimistic Analysts See Further Drops in Rates

BYLINE: By H. J. MAIDENBERG

 BODY:
Although the recent decline in long-term interest rates came to a sudden halt on Friday, optimistic money-market analysts insist that the pause is only temporary, resulting mostly from technical factors. High among the factors they cite is the large volume of Treasury borrowings scheduled for the next three weeks.
Moreover, the optimists say rates could resume their decline after the Federal Reserve's policy makers meet on May 14. 
 But those who hold that the decline has ended say a combination of an economic revival and more borrowing by Federal, state and municipal governments will force interest rates higher.
 
Long Bond Yielding 8.24%
 Interest rates, as measured by the yield on the Treasury's bellwether 30-year bonds, climbed last week. Late Friday, the price of the Treasury's long bonds had dropped enough to raise the yield to 8.24 percent, from 8.17 percent the day before and 8.14 percent a week earlier.
"While the credit markets have taken a bearish view, as reflected by the rise in yields, bond prices will resume their advance in a matter of weeks," said Philip Braverman, senior vice president and chief economist at DKB Securities Inc., the domestic arm of the Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank of Tokyo.
Mr. Braverman, who has maintained for many months that the trend in interest rates is downward, said Friday that there were several reasons why the decline in long-term rates had suddenly halted.
"For one," he said, "a relatively large supply of Treasury paper is coming to market in a relatively brief period, and at a time when yields on such debt has declined substantially in recent weeks."
 
$21 Billion Auction
 This week the Treasury will auction $21 billion of two- and five-year notes. Many Government securities dealers who bid at the April 10 auction of $8.5 billion of seven-year notes were unable to distribute the issue to retail customers without incurring losses.
On May 7 to 9, the Treasury will hold its quarterly refunding auctions. Some $35 billion of notes and bonds are expected to be offered. The terms of the refunding are to be announced on May 1.
Along with the temporary surge in the supply of Treasury securities, Mr. Braverman cited the usual short-selling by dealers, speculators and others who plan to bid for this week's offerings.
On Friday, dealers atributed part of the price decline in Treasury debt issues to short-selling. The short-selling is expected to increase as the refunding nears.
By selling short in the Treasury market, or selling borrowed debt issues similar to those they plan to bid for, the dealers in Treasury debt and others hope to hedge against a decline in the price of their newly acquired issues.
 
Offsetting Potential Losses
 If prices do fall after an auction, the loss may be largely offset by the profit made by buying back, at a lower price, the securities previously sold short. Conversely, if prices rise after the auction, the increased value of the newly acquired inventory should largely offset the loss on the securities sold short. Moreover, when the short-sellers close out their positions, the resulting buying tends to push prices higher.
But earlier in the week, when the Dow Jones industrial average finally broke through the 3,000 barrier, some dealers feared that managers of pension and mutual funds and other institutions would shift more of their holdings out of Treasury issues and other fixed-income securities and into stocks.
These fears are expected to be factored into the bidding at the auctions, despite the retreat of stock and bond prices late last week.
 
'A Decline of This Magnitude'
 Mr. Braverman of DKB Securities said another reason that bond prices should resume their climb could become clear on Friday, when the Government releases its report on the gross national product in the first quarter. He expects the data will show a decline of 3.5 percent, compared with the 1.6 percent decline reported for the last quarter of 1990.
 Had it not been for a surge in exports late in 1990, fourth-quarter G.N.P. would have been down 5.1 percent, he pointed out.
"A decline of this magnitude ought to be enough to finally galvanize any but this Federal Reserve Board into more responsible easing of credit," he said. "In fairness, however, the last meeting of the Fed's Open Market Committee did reveal unusually sharp divisions over whether or not to ease interest rates. We believe the May 14 meeting could well lead to a resumption of a series of small steps to ease credit through the rest of the year."

HEADLINE: J. C. Penney's Woes Tied to Lack of Identity

BYLINE: By ISADORE BARMASH

 BODY:
The J. C. Penney Company had high hopes that by now it would be enjoying the fruits of its 1987 transformation from a full-line department store to primarily a clothing store.
Instead, it has run into a buzzsaw of problems that are cutting heavily into sales and earnings. 
 The company has just reported a 6.6 percent decline in its March sales compared with a year ago, and sales at stores open at least a year were down 8 percent. While Sears, Roebuck & Company said Thursday that its profit had soared 91 percent in the first quarter, analysts say they expect a 50 percent drop in earnings when Penney issues its first-quarter report on May 14. Those declines follow a dismal 1990, in which Penney's earnings fell 26.1 percent.
Robert Gill, vice chairman of Penney, which is based near Dallas, said the company expected to report a "substantially down quarter" in its next earnings report.
Many retailing analysts and consultants say Penney's troubles stem partly from stiff price-cutting by competitors and partly from the chain's failure to attract fashion-minded women looking for exciting styles and well-known brand names.
Even so, these experts have mixed feelings about Penney's continuing experiment to sharpen its 1,800 stores with the right mix of national clothing brands and glitzier decor and merchandise. While these changes may eventually pay off, analysts say, Penney seems to have no distinct merchandising or pricing identity.
"Penney is perhaps the single retailer most vulnerable to broad economic trends," said Andrew D. Regan, an analyst at the Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette Securities Corporation in New York, "given its position as a mid-priced store in a merchandising transition, seeking to convince shoppers to experiment with the new Penney approach of more upscale products. Such experimentation is more difficult to encourage when the consumer is cautious."
Penney's prices are generally moderate, but its stores do not carry the wide variety of discounted merchandise that Wal-Mart stores do. And, while Penney's clothing is generally of high quality, it has yet to catch up to a Macy or Nordstrom in designer-level fashions. Penney is "known more for its pricing than for its women's wear brands," says Daniel D. Barry, a retail analyst for Kidder, Peabody & Company in New York.
 
Trying to Step Up Efforts
 Company executives acknowledge that they have not moved quickly enough to add more familiar labels and say they are trying to step up those efforts.
"We've made some progress," said Mr. Gill. "In women's furnishings, we have added Warner and Bally, but we do need more brands in women's sportswear. We would like to get the Liz Claiborne line, which is the major sportswear line in department stores. But we remain hopeful that the company will ship to us and not just the traditional department stores in our markets.
"Our sales will be flat for same stores, partly because our catalogue sales have contributed to that. Since Desert Storm, the number of catalogue phone calls has dropped 18 to 20 percent since last year, to recent days when they were down just 4 percent. So a lot of consumers just aren't buying. But our most recent books, for the spring-summer period, are doing better."
Some analysts say that while Penney, like many other stores, has been hurt by consumer caution, it could do better if it moved faster to place national brands in its stores, especially in the crucial women's clothing departments.
Those analysts noted how Penney's sales and earnings soared in the first two years after it dropped major appliances, toys, sporting goods, big electronic products and automotive accessories, and they cite the success since then of its children's and men's clothing.
Many of Penney's root problems are similar to those of some other large chains, notably Sears. Penney is having trouble switching from store brands to national brands and like Sears, its huge catalogue business, representing about 18 percent of total volume, is not performing well.
While Sears's latest results indicate that it is getting control of its internal operating costs, Penney's operating expenses appear to be rising.
 
A String of Problems
 Mr. Regan of Donaldson, Lufkin sees a string of problems. "More important than the actual results," he said, "were the unfavorable trends driving them: consistent, top-line weakness; declining, but still high, gross margins and poor expense control. Poor sales momentum, weakening margins and rising expenses going into 1991 reinforce our projection of modest earnings growth in the year ahead and into 1992."
Mr. Gill denied that Penney had failed to keep operating costs low. "While our sales have been lackluster," he said, "we are one of the better performers in keeping costs low. This year, we are operating at the same expense levels of 1990."
Penney's stock closed Friday at $52, up 25 cents, continuing a recent trend in the low- and mid-$50's. That is about the midpoint of the year's range of $70.125 and $37.375.
 
Goods Not Profitable Enough
 Penney executives say they made the change away from big-ticket department store items because those goods were not profitable enough. And they add that research showed customers looking for that merchandise preferred to shop at specialty stores, not the malls where Penney stores are largely situated.
Penney's changes, like Montgomery Ward's action the same year to drop its century-old catalogue, the oldest in retailing, were viewed as significant and risky moves.
For two and a half years, it appeared that Penney's move to give up about $1.5 billion in volume, an amount equal to its operating income of that year, was a risk that was paying off. Net income rose to $807 million in 1988, from $608 million in 1987 and just $478 million in 1986.
But, in 1990, Penney's much-watched effort started to falter, and family apparel was particularly hard hit.
A recent visit to the Penney store at the Roosevelt Field Shopping Center in Garden City, L.I., gave some indication of what the chain may be up against. Roosevelt Field is the largest mall on Long Island, and Penney and Macy's are both anchor stores there.
"I like Macy's because it has nice clothes and there's no pressure," said one shopper, Harriet Feldheim, of Oceanside, L.I. "I like brand names, and I never go to Penney."
Another shopper, Suad Raby, of Great Neck, L.I., said: "Brand names aren't important. Macy's has higher-quality merchandise than Penney, and their prices are higher but not unreasonably. I'm going to shop more at Penney because of their low prices."
Brand names do not mean much, said Mary Ellen Korshek of Garden City South, L.I. "Personally, I think Penney's quality is just as good as Macy's, and their prices are lower, so that's where I go."
 
$16.4 Billion in Sales
 Still, Penney's huge size -- the 1,800 stores and 2,000 catalogue sales offices, all accounting last year for $16.4 billion in sales -- is not lost on the experts. The company also has the most extensive telecommunications and information systems in the industry and a reputation for specifications for private brands that are among the most stringent.
Robert F. Buchanan, a retail analyst for Alex. Brown & Sons in Baltimore, has lowered his estimate of Penney's first-quarter earnings to 69 cents a share from his previous estimate of 88 cents, against the previous year's $1.21 a share. But Mr. Buchanan says he is still optimistic long term on Penney. "Looking ahead, we expect quarterly year-over-year earnings comparisons to improve gradually as the year progresses," he said.

HEADLINE: Hispanic Paper Defies the Ad Slump

BYLINE: By TIM GOLDEN

 BODY:
As New York City's three big tabloids march off to something resembling newspaper Armageddon, their spoils are looking rather paltry. Advertisers are watching their budgets, readership is on the wane, and profits bear only a ghostly resemblance to their former selves.
Meanwhile, the publishers of a smaller tabloid are looking at a future in which their competition may be thinning and their circulation growing. 
 The difference is one of language. Despite the odds against any newspaper dodging the impact of a faltering retail economy, the men who run El Diario-La Prensa, New York City's largest Spanish-language paper, believe it is a life-saving distinction.
"All advertising-sensitive media have been getting hammered over the last year or two," said Peter W. Davidson, El Diario's president. "There's still a huge potential in serving the Spanish-language market."
So far, the paper is reaping the benefits of that potential. In the six months ended Sept. 30, the most recent period in which Audit Bureau of Circulations figures are available, El Diario's weekday circulation grew 8 percent, to an average of 57,099. The gains came despite a 10-cent price increase, to 45 cents a copy.
And El Diario's advertising revenues rose 19.7 percent in the fiscal year ended Sept. 30, with total revenues rising about 10 percent, executives of the privately owned paper said. They declined to give specific revenue or profit figures.
The fuel of El Diario's growth is a furious expansion of the Spanish-speaking market. In New York City alone, the 1990 census found the number of people identifying themselves as Hispanic rose 18.8 percent over the 1980's, to 1.7 million.
Across New York State, the Hispanic population rose 33.4 percent, to 2.2 million. Connecticut's Hispanic population grew by 71.2 percent and New Jersey's by 66.4 percent.
 
Big Expansion Effort
 But El Diario has not limited its sights on New York and its surroundings. In recent months, the paper's delivery trucks have ranged as far south as Washington and as far north as Montreal, finding little competition in between.
To the west, the paper has been sifting for new ventures among the Spanish-language weeklies in such cities as Chicago and Dallas.
On May 1, El Diario will embark on its first such effort, taking over production of a San Francisco weekly, El Mensajero. By teaming its production plant in New York with local distributors and reporters in other cities, El Diario's publishers hope to develop a network of local dailies or possibly a national publication.
How far they are able to reach, however, may also depend on how they fare at home.
So far, while its executives say the paper has turned a steady profit since 1986, it has fallen short of the high hopes that Mr. Davidson voiced when he and a group of investors bought the paper 20 months ago for about $20 million from the Gannett Company. But that has not dimmed confidence.
"The market is just out there waiting," said El Diario's publisher, Carlos Ramirez.
As newspaper territory, much of Spanish-speaking New York remains unconquered. For a paper that not so long ago thought of its constituency in clear-cut terms -- "Spanish" New York was a Puerto Rican city, and El Diario was foremost a Puerto Rican paper -- the last two decades have brought striking changes.
Puerto Ricans now make up barely half of New York City's legal Hispanic residents and perhaps only a third of all Hispanic residents in the metropolitan area, demographers for the city Planning Department say.
 
The Other Two-Thirds
 El Diario's editors believe that Dominicans and Ecuadoreans, newer immigrants with different concerns, comprise nearly another third of the area's Hispanic residents.
The last third is more complicated still: Spanish executives and former Mexican farm laborers, political refugees from Central America and professionals from South America.
"Two years ago, you could still say that the most important group were the Puerto Ricans," said the paper's editor, Fernando Moreno. "Now you can't say that anymore. The community has grown much more cosmopolitan at all levels -- intellectual, social, economic."
In recent months, El Diario has been changing quickly, too. It has redesigned and shifted its focus. Like the country's Spanish-language television news programs and the two larger Spanish-language dailies, La Opinion of Los Angeles and El Nuevo Herald of Miami, El Diario has been working hard to become more cosmopolitan. News from Latin America is being covered more extensively.
Mr. Moreno said El Diario would not neglect local news of Hispanic interest, but would try to balance it against the importance of other news.
"Our people have the same needs as everyone else," he said.
"If there's a war in the Persian Gulf, I'm not going to put on the front page that Congressman Serrano had a car accident," he said, referring to Jose Serrano, a Bronx Democrat.
Predictably, the reorientation has prompted some suggestions among the paper's competitors that El Diario may lose readers in trying to become too much for too many.
In Queens, especially, a handful of tiny weeklies oriented to different Latin nationalities have sprouted. El Especial, a weekly in Union City, N.J., has risen to what its publishers claim is a circulation of 60,000 after only five years. El Vocero, Puerto Rico's largest paper, has a steady readership of about 30,000 around New York. Only Noticias del Mundo, which is sponsored by a branch of the Unification Church of the Rev. Sun Myung Moon, has seemed to falter.
 
Broadcasting Outlets
The area's two New Jersey-based Spanish-language television stations and its principal Spanish-language radio station have grown as well. But Mr. Davidson and some of his competitors said El Diario's biggest challenge was coming from the economy.
"I think they have good times ahead if they can hold on and stay in business," said Mara M. Rankin, the general manager of WXTV-Channel 41, the leading Spanish-language station. "But it may be a long wait."
 Directing the paper's growth is an unlikely troika: Mr. Moreno, a writer of fiction who was raised in Tangiers and educated in Spain; Mr. Ramirez, a man of Puerto Rican ancestry, born in Queens and trained as an accountant, and Mr. Davidson, an "Anglo" banker who arrived as general partner of El Diario Associates by way of Stanford, Harvard and Morgan Stanley & Company.
 Initially, Mr. Davidson and Mr. Ramirez expressed hopes of 20 to 50 percent annual growth in advertising revenues. But both of them see promise in the 19.7 percent growth last year, although much of it came from a big increase in ad rates.
 "We still have a lot to do," Mr. Ramirez said. "I see this big advertising pie and I don't think all of the Spanish vehicles - television, radio, newspapers - have half of it. Bloomingdale's does not realize that our readers shop there. All of our readers are not waiters and doormen."

HEADLINE: Market Place;
Municipal Bonds And Extra Yields

BYLINE: By Floyd Norris

 BODY:
BORROWING short and lending long can be a sure road to wealth -- unless short-term rates rise too far.
That method of enhancing yield has helped to produce a hot product in the tax-exempt municipal bond market. Effectively, it allows buyers of long-term municipal bonds, which pay interest around 7 percent, to borrow some of the purchase money at short-term municipal bond rates, which tend to be around 4 percent. The extra yield goes into the pockets of the long-term buyers. 
 The product is a closed-end municipal bond fund, with both common and preferred stock. It is the preferred stock that gives it the borrowing characteristic, and that enables the holders of the common stock to garner the extra yield.
A closed-end fund is similar to an open-end mutual fund. The main difference is that shares in the fund trade on exchanges, or over the counter, rather than being sold and redeemed by the fund itself. As a result, the shares can sell for more, or less, than the underlying value of the securities in the portfolios.
For a fund manager, a big advantage of running a closed-end fund, compared with an open-end one, is that less cash needs to be kept on hand because there is no threat that investors will redeem shares. Thus more of the money can be put to work.
Although closed-end stock funds have been around for decades, they did not make their debut in the municipal bond market until 1986, during a boom in the issuance of closed-end stock funds. The boom in such stock funds has ended, but closed-end municipal funds continue to sell well.
The adding of preferred shares to closed-end municipal funds did not start until 1988, when $614 million in such shares were sold. That figure grew to $1.2 billion the following year and to $1.5 billion last year. In the first quarter of this year, $461 million of preferred shares were sold, according to John Nuveen & Company, which pioneered the use of preferred shares and still issues more than all its competitors combined.
There are now closed-end funds that specialize in bonds of certain states, including New York, Pennsylvania, California and Florida, as well as funds that buy municipal bonds from throughout the country.
The preferred shares are similar to auction-rate preferred stocks issued by many companies, in that they promise the investor in the preferred a way to get out after a very brief interval, in this case seven days. The preferred shares are issued in $50,000 denominations, with the interest rate set every week.
Effectively, the preferred shares are a super-safe way for an investor to park money for tax-free income with no concern over loss of principal. The mechanism by which the rate is set is supposed to assure any investors who want out at the end of the week that they will be able to get out.
Timothy R. Schwertfeger, an executive vice president at Nuveen, said one advantage for the funds was that the municipal market had a relative shortage of short-term borrowers. Generally, those are cities and states that borrow money pending the receipt of taxes. Because the preferred shares are only one-third of a fund's total capitalization, there is virtually no chance of a default from them, so demand for the paper is high.
For the common holders, the benefit while short-term rates are low is that they get some of the yield from bonds that were bought with the short-term investors' money. Moreover, if interest rates fall, as they have recently, the net asset value of the common shares will rise even more rapidly than the value of the underlying bonds.
That enthusiasm has led to buyers of the closed-end funds being willing to pay more than net asset values for the shares, with an average premium of around 5 percent. Mr. Schwertfeger said in an interview that he believed that premium reflected a market feeling that interest rates would continue to decline, thus driving net asset values up further.
But the flip side of the advantage will occur if rates begin to rise. As short-term rates rise, the amount of yield left over for the common holders will decline. If long-term rates also rise, the value of the bonds the funds hold will fall, and the net asset value of the common shares will decline more rapidly than the value of the bonds.
The market consensus, for what it's worth, is that there is little danger of a sharp rise in interest rates in the near future. But owners of closed-end municipal bond funds should remember that such an event is possible, and that the extra yield they are now receiving was available in part because they were willing to take on that added risk.

HEADLINE: Europe Stumbles in Computers

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PARIS, April 20

 BODY:
Europe's computer makers, outmuscled by their American and Japanese competitors, are desperately fighting for survival. They are laying off thousands as they struggle to slash their losses, but some analysts say most of them will either collapse or sell out to competitors overseas.
"The game is pretty much lost," said Dorian Foyil, who follows European computer companies for UBS Phillips & Drew in London. "It's just a matter of time before they disappear." 
 Many European officials say they cannot let the continent that gave the world Aristotle and Galileo be vanquished in such a crucial industry. They fear that the disappearance of Europe's computer makers would weaken other industries, including automobiles, aerospace and consumer electronics.
 
Shocked by Japanese Incursion
 Many Europeans were appalled in July when the Fujitsu group of Japan bought 80 percent of Britain's leading computer maker, International Computers Ltd.
"We want to keep the European industry European," said Filippo Maria Pandolfi, technology commissioner of the European Community.
Demonstrating how far governments are willing to go, France recently pledged more than $1 billion to shore up the capital of Compagnie des Machines Bull and help pay for its research. Bull, France's largest computer manufacturer, lost $1.2 billion in 1990.
Across the Rhine, Nixdorf Computer A.G. lost $600 million in 1989 before agreeing to be acquired by Siemens A.G. as an alternative to bankruptcy.
Philips N.V., the Dutch electronics giant, has laid off a third of the workers in its money-losing computer division as part of a companywide revamping that led to a $2.25 billion loss last year. Olivetti S.p.A., Italy's flagship computer company, has reacted to declining profits by laying off 7,000 workers.
Europe's manufacturers are besieged by American competitors, who draw encouragement from computer prices often 50 percent higher than in the United States and who have benefited from the dollar's weakness in 1989-90. And Europe's $45 billion computer market is expected to grow faster than the more mature American market. The Compaq Computer Corporation, based in Houston, boasts that its sales in Europe soared 50 percent last year.
"The profits are there to be had," said Mr. Foyil, the analyst. "If the Europeans can't make money in their own backyard, they're not going to make money in the future."
Some analysts say Europe's computer manufacturers will remain far behind the Americans and Japanese in efficiency and innovation. Since Europe's manufacturers are far smaller, they have far less money for research and development. The combined computer sales of Europe's four leading computer companies are just one-third of I.B.M.'s. Siemens-Nixdorf, Europe's largest computer maker, ranks just fifth in worldwide computer sales.
 
U.S. Advantage in PC's
 The growing market for personal computers is enhancing the American advantage. Led by I.B.M., based in Armonk, N.Y., the five largest sellers of personal computers in Europe in 1990 were all American.
While the Continent's top computer makers are sustaining heavy losses, the International Business Machines Corporation, with 12 factories in Europe, had European earnings of $2.98 billion last year, almost half of the company's total profits.
But with European economies slowing, I.B.M. said the Continent had contributed to its dismal first-quarter results. And the company is trimming its European staff.
Still, many American companies are having greater success abroad than at home. "If you want to know where the major U.S. personal computer firms are making money these days, it's not in the U.S.," John Sculley, the chairman of Apple Computer Inc., based in Cupertino, Calif., said recently. "There really is no European computer industry. So we are doing well there."
 
Slow to Innovate
 The Europeans have been handicapped by a late start. Key inventions that originated in the United States took years to cross the Atlantic.
The European manufacturers developed in small domestic markets that gave them few economies of scale. As the companies fell further behind I.B.M., several nations merged their small computer makers into single national champions, which the governments lavished with orders.
Nurtured by their governments, the European companies felt little need to keep up with advances developed in the highly competitive American market. "I am profoundly convinced that the origin of the weakness of European industry is fragmented markets and short-sighted protectionist policies." Carlo de Benedetti, the chairman of Olivetti, told a group of reporters recently.
Fragmented markets mean large bureaucracies for small domestic bases, marketing staffs for each European country, and extra work adapting computers for Spanish or Italian companies. The Europeans have suffered more than I.B.M. in Europe because I.B.M. can spread its costs over a huge domestic market.
Europe's fragmentation has inflated staffs so much that Bull's computer sales per employee were $120,000 last year and Siemens's $145,000, while Apple had sales of $420,000 per employee.
 
Alliances May Be Necessary
 Many industry experts say European companies must work more closely together or even merge. "If the Europeans don't want to disappear, they have to form alliances among themselves," said Francis Lorentz, the chairman of Bull.
Twenty years ago, European governments pushed Bull, Siemens, International Computers and Olivetti to form one giant company, but these producers failed to agree on who would run it.
Now, every European computer maker seems to think the others are too ill to be partners. Olivetti's talks with International Computers and Philips have collapsed.
Still, there are some small joint ventures, like an agreement between Bull and Olivetti to make automated teller machines for banks. Under agreements with non-European producers, NEC Corporation of Japan is helping to produce Bull's largest mainframe and Hitachi Ltd. is making some of Olivetti's most powerful machines.
 
Strategies for Survival
 Each company is charting a survival strategy. Bull is taking a $600 million charge to lay off 20 percent of its workers and close 7 of its 13 factories. The company has sought to reach global scale by acquiring the computer businesses of Honeywell Inc. and Zenith Electronics. Bull has joined the manufacturers who back open systems, which allow one computer maker's hardware to be linked to another's.
"They have a sustainable long-term strategy on paper," said Jonathan Portch, an analyst with the International Data Corporation in London. But that strategy may face some problems.
Open systems mean lower profit margins than proprietary systems. And some customers may still consider Bull too small to serve their needs. "The big spenders on the big mainframes are usually multinationals," said John Newman, a consultant with BIS Strategic Decisions, a computer consulting firm. "They're looking not for national suppliers, but global suppliers. Historically, the European computer manufacturers are not seen that way."
Olivetti, Europe's leading producer of personal computers, is straining to keep up with American and Japanese manufacturers. But it remains strong in selling computers to banks. Alluding to the government subsidies that many other European computer makers receive, Mr. de Benedetti said, "The only information-technology company in Europe that has no Godfather and is not losing money is Olivetti."
Siemens's computer division has suffered losses since it acquired Nixdorf in January 1990, but it hopes to be profitable by late 1992. Thanks to Siemens's huge hoard of cash and stronger demand from a reunited Germany, many analysts say Siemens is the healthiest of Europe's computer makers.
 
European Commission's Plan
 Philips officials vow to remain in the business, but many analysts question the company's commitment because they see Philips relying on Asian suppliers for many personal computers. "Philips will get out of the computer business," Mr. de Benedetti predicted. "In other countries there will be a process of selection and consolidation."
The European Commission, the European Community's executive branch, wants to help the Continent's computer makers survive without lavishing huge subsidies on the industry. The commission plans to aid the companies by establishing a "European nervous system" that would enable Italy's tax authorities to transfer data to Britain's, for instance, and let shoppers use their bank cards in teller machines from Malaga to Munich. The commission is also helping to finance Joint Silicon Structures, a multibillion-dollar consortium to develop advanced semiconductors.
Several computer executives said that even with a $5 billion budget, the commission's efforts were too modest, considering the American advantage of a huge domestic market and Japan's success in keeping much of its domestic market closed to foreign competition.
Some commission officials say France's aid to Bull gives the computer maker an unfair advantage and violates the commission's rules limiting subsidies. But French officials argue that the rules on subsidies may have to be loosened to keep Europe's computer industry alive.
"The industry does not grow spontaneously like a mushroom in autumn," said Roger Fauroux, France's Minister of Industry. In his view, it needs "a favorable environment and intelligent help from the state."

Bronx Man Is Smitten By the Bug

BYLINE: By DAVID GONZALEZ

 BODY:
If Sotero Calo had his way, the streets of the Bronx would be crawling with bugs.
Mexican beetles. 
 Mr. Calo is not an eccentric entomologist but a mechanic with a mission -- to keep his beloved Volkswagen Beetles scooting about the streets of the South Bronx. As president of the Puerto Rico Volky Club, he wistfully notes that his ovoid object of desire is now built only in Mexico.
"The demand there is so great, they can't make enough," he said. "I hope that car returns to New York."
But emissions and safety standards make it nearly impossible to market that car north of the border, so Mr. Calo satisfies his Beetlemania by tinkering with the hardy remnants of the five million Volkswagens sold in the United States between 1949 and 1979. With a surgeon's skill and a craftsman's soul, he and the club's nine other members chop, paint and otherwise transform the lowly Beetles into revved-up roadsters that escort politicians and prom queens at special events.
Children rush to the curb and excitedly jump up and down, pointing out their favorites whenever the club's caravan rumbles down the street with a white convertible Beetle in the lead. Rolling behind are Beetles with fat black tires, Beetles with fluorescent pink hubcaps and Beetles with booming speakers ringed by lights that pulsate to the beat of salsa music.
Invariably, the loudest cheers are for Mr. Calo's "Volky pickup," a bright yellow 1971 Beetle whose rear was lopped off and replaced with a jacked-up wood-paneled flatbed that sits atop flaring exhaust pipes.
"The Volky is the only car for me," said Mr. Calo, a rumpled, portly man who also makes his living fixing cars. "It's a unique car, but they're all the same. Anything you put on it will make it stand out."
In the same way, Mr. Calo's efforts stand out in his part of Crotona, a weary dust-blown patch of the Bronx surrounded by gaping lots and street-corner drug dealers. The wooden house on Mohegan Avenue where he lives with his family and the adjoining garage and garden is an automotive oasis cluttered with fenders, tires, transmissions and the ever-present Volkies in various stages of repair.
Mr. Calo, 47 years old, started the club in 1982, soon after buying his first Volkswagen in fulfillment of a dream he had as a child in Puerto Rico. While tooling around the Bronx one afternoon, he was approached by Israel Baez, another Volkswagen owner who wanted to start a custom car club like the ones popular in Puerto Rico.
Over the years, members have joined the club in much the same serendipitous manner, encountering the caravan on the street and falling in behind. New members do not have to have pristine Beetles to join, but they have to promise to fix them up soon after.
They gather each week at the "Volky Garden," a community garden that abuts Mr. Calo's house, and help each other with repairs and improvements on cars dating back as far as 1953, whose engines are cleaned more often than some people brush their teeth.
Like true believers, they still lament the passing of the Beetle. "It was an economical car and Americans don't like economy," Mr. Calo theorized. "They want something that breaks down fast so they can sell it fast."
He and his club have an eye for true luxury, especially with the green convertible whose spotless white interior is accented by a Rolls-Royce-style hood and mahogany running boards. "Everywhere we go, we put a Volky next to a Mercedes or a Cadillac and everyone looks at the Volky," he said. "We've proved it."
Those high-priced land yachts will get a run for their money when the club combines two Beetles to build a four-door limousine complete with a bar, televison and stereo. "That is my dream," Mr. Calo intoned. "I hope to do it before dying."
Mr. Calo knows value -- both in cars and people. Apart from serving as escorts at weddings and "Sweet 16" parties, he and fellow club members are familiar volunteers at parades and youth festivals, giving free rides -- and a strong anti-drug message -- to youngsters. On Halloween they convert their clubhouse into a haunted house and on Mother's Day they whip up a small feast for the neighborhood.
Recently, envisioning a broad auto-lovers' confederation devoted not just to cars but to promoting Hispanic culture and civic pride, Mr. Calo convened a meeting of six other auto clubs from as far away as Hartford -- greeting arriving visitors with Beetle reception committees lurking on the off-ramps of the Cross Bronx Expressway.
In communities once so blighted they were compared to post-war Berlin, a group of men devoted to salvaging German cars are trying to revive the neighborhoods. Their spirit is summed up by one word they have emblazoned on their club's jackets: "conquistando," conquering.
"Since 1982, we've been conquering the streets, and we haven't fallen," said Mr. Calo. "We want to overcome."

HEADLINE: METRO MATTERS;
Ghost of '75 Dogs A Wary Dinkins In Fiscal Struggle

BYLINE: By SAM ROBERTS

 BODY:
John E. Zuccotti vividly recalls telephoning the White House on the night of Oct. 16, 1975. The incoming First Deputy Mayor was calling to inform President Gerald R. Ford that New York City would run out of money in the morning. Mr. Zuccotti was told that the President was already asleep.
But at Gracie Mansion that night, city officials and their financial advisers were rudely, if belatedly, roused into grappling with the apparent denouement of a lingering crisis. While they scraped together enough cash to avert an immediate default, a contingency committee convened to ponder a fundamental question: Whom should the city pay first if it runs short of money? 
 The surprising consensus: water-supply workers and bridge tenders (since Federal law required that drawbridges be left raised if they are unattended). Also, police, fire and sanitation employees and hospital workers and suppliers. Teachers were a low priority, since classes would probably be suspended.
A last-minute investment of teachers' union pension funds made the doomsday planning moot. But it marked a defining moment. It prompted the city to review its priorities and, at least hypothetically, to acknowledge its limits and adjust its agenda.
Today New York City and State face a combined deficit of about $10 billion through July 1992. But City Hall, as in early 1975, has again been diverted by inconsistency and chronic drift, by finger-pointing and by suspicions about the motives of a Governor unable to balance his own budget and further frustrated with a Mayor whose administration seemed at times to have made matters worse.
 There is little sense of crisis. There is less consensus about solutions.
 In contrast with 1975, the credit markets haven't closed to the city, although Mayor David N. Dinkins would rather avoid unnecessary borrowing because the city is being charged junk bond rates (and rising rates could portend worse market jitters).
The current fiscal year's deficit, if it doesn't grow, is generally regarded as manageable with a cohesive program to slash purchases, tap reserves, speed payments due from Albany, engage in gimmickry that fiscal monitors agree to wink at, cajole the City Comptroller into cooperating and coax municipal unions into making modest concessions.
"You'd have to take the scenario pretty far down the road to get to where we were then," says Ira M. Millstein, a lawyer who was advising Mayor Abraham D. Beame in 1975. "That was a crisis. This is just a mess."
But how will officials come to grips with projected deficits in the state's fiscal year, which began three weeks ago, and in the fiscal year the city starts 10 weeks from today? The city's budget gap has been made worse by Albany's; both are driven by the recession. Gov. Mario M. Cuomo has been further hobbled by his reluctance to be perceived as usurping the authority of the city's first black Mayor.
Would Mr. Cuomo even want to? No, because he has enough trouble with the state's finances without being held directly responsible for the city's. Yes, because the resurgence of the Financial Control Board, over which he presides and on which the Mayor sits, might buy fiscal flexibility and a reprieve for the Governor, for Mr. Dinkins and for many of his constituents, who might otherwise lose their city jobs, be deprived of city services and be taxed heavier. Hence ambivalence, although the Governor would rather be perceived as a victim of circumstance than a co-conspirator.
"Politically," says Felix G. Rohatyn, chairman of the Municipal Assistance Corporation, "no governor is eager to intrude on the city unless he has absolutely no choice or is absolutely certain of success. Neither condition prevails at this point."
Meanwhile a window of opportunity is slipping shut. Mr. Zuccotti, now a real-estate development executive, says the Mayor "quite frankly could do more."
"There's no question that the criticism about leadership is valid," he says. "I'm not saying what he had to do is easy. But it's a plus in the sense that if he does step up to the plate, he could do a lot."
Mr. Rohatyn says he doesn't regret having voting for Mr. Dinkins. But he says that what he terms the city administration's "policy schizophrenia" and "inept" labor negotiations -- compounded by the state's deficit -- have contributed to "creeping paralysis" rather than to boldness. "Political leaders need a clear, simple crisis symbol," he said, adding that, unlike 1975, "they do not have it today."
They may, if the financial mess is allowed to fester. Then the debate may shift to whether some temporary return of the control board would confer a strategic opportunity, an excuse to avoid tough choices or a stigma to be avoided at all cost.

HEADLINE: POLITICAL MEMO;
Cuomo Sends Dinkins Smoky Fiscal Signal

BYLINE: By KEVIN SACK, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ALBANY, April 21

 BODY:
New York City officials readily concede that Gov. Mario M. Cuomo plays politics at a level far above theirs, a level that one aide to Mayor David N. Dinkins likened to three-dimensional chess.
In rosier times, there might have been an esthetic appreciation of the Governor's mastery. But amid this year's frenzy of fiscal distress, there is a growing frustration -- and confusion -- among city officials about moves that Mr. Cuomo has made in recent weeks. 
 Many members of the Dinkins administration view Albany as a place through the looking glass, where what is said is not always what is meant. With New York City slipping closer to crisis every day, city officials say the Governor has been sending fuzzy and sometimes contradictory signals about his positions on the city's labor negotiations and whether he really opposes a takeover of the city's finances by the state's Financial Control Board.
City officials can only speculate about the Governor's real agenda, and Mr. Cuomo's aides suggest that any perception of brinksmanship is the paranoid invention of the Mayor's staff. But in politics, perception is often reality, and the timing could prove perilous, given the high stakes for both Mr. Cuomo and Mr. Dinkins.
Many political analysts warn that Mr. Dinkins will be a one-term mayor if he does not quickly disprove the critics who say he is not up to the task of managing the country's largest city. Mr. Cuomo, meanwhile, seems eager to use his austere state budget proposal to demonstrate -- certainly to disgruntled voters in New York and perhaps to a national electorate -- that the caricature of him as a tax-and-spend liberal is unfounded.
But at a time when the political destinies of the Mayor and the Governor are so tightly interwoven, the uncertain relationship between the Capitol and City Hall has made it harder to break the impasse over the state budget and protect the city from receivership.
On Friday, for instance, Mr. Cuomo made it clear that he still felt that the state could not offer financial help to the city until Mr. Dinkins extracted concessions from municipal labor unions. That obliterated the impression that Dinkins aides said they got from a meeting with Mr. Cuomo on Thursday.
Mr. Dinkins and Mr. Cuomo emerged from that meeting to declare confidently that the city could and would avert a takeover by the Financial Control Board. The Mayor said at a news conference that state help no longer depended on union concessions. The Governor, standing at his side, did not protest.
Because the public feud between Mr. Cuomo and the municipal unions had created a logjam in negotiations between the city and its workers, city officials welcomed Mr. Cuomo's silence.
But Mr. Cuomo said in an interview on Friday that his position had not changed. He said he could not justify offering state aid to the city when his own budget called for layoffs and a wage freeze for state workers while Mr. Dinkins recently gave wage increases to municipal unions.
"How do I explain to this state and its workers that instead of taking wealth and finding a way to share it with them, I in effect shared it with a city that used wealth it didn't have -- otherwise they wouldn't be asking you for money -- to give to its employees?" Mr. Cuomo asked.
Barry Feinstein, president of Local 237 of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, one of the most influential municipal unions, said his mood had swung from delight to depression in one day. "I am now very disappointed," he said on Friday night. "It just distresses me."
 
Cuomo's Sincerity Questioned
 Perhaps the most telling evidence that the Dinkins administration regards Mr. Cuomo with suspicion is that city officials question whether the Governor is sincere when he says he does not want the Financial Control Board to take over the city's finances.
 
'Nobody Could Figure It Out'
 "There were doubts," said one top Dinkins aide, whose views were echoed by a second. "Nobody could figure it out."
Mr. Cuomo has said repeatedly said that such a takeover should be avoided at all costs, and his aides have painted the prospect as an enormous liability for him. The control board, which was created as a result of the 1975 fiscal crisis and is led by Mr. Cuomo, would regulate the city's finances if the city has a deficit of $100 million or more at the end of its fiscal year on June 30.
Some city officials say that by talking so much about a takeover, Mr. Cuomo has undermined confidence in the Mayor and contributed to what may become a self-fulfilling prophecy. They speculate that the Governor is trying to divert attention from the state's own big significant fiscal problems.
"One theory," said one Dinkins aide, "was that he was going to be blamed for New York City's problems in any event. And if he was going to need some power to deal with these issues, the control board would give him an institutional mechanism to deal with them.
"The other theory was that if he was going to pursue other aspirations, the control board mechanisms are so strong that there has to be a solution. And so that would seem like a fiscal success story compared to whatever impression is left about the state's problems."
The head-scratching became vigorous on Tuesday, when the Governor said he was exploring whether it would be possible to raise the $100 million deficit limit to help avoid a takeover.
By implication, Mr. Cuomo seemed to suggest that he did not believe Mr. Dinkins could bring the city's budget gap, currently estimated at about $300 million, to under $100 million in less than three months.
A day later, the Governor said his lawyers had concluded that such a move would not be legal. But in the interim, yields on city bonds rose slightly, and some because of uncertainty that some bond traders attributed it to uncertainty caused by Mr. Cuomo's comments. If the yields, or interest rates the city must pay, remain high, the cost of the bonds increases for the city.
"He put something out, he knew it was wrong, and he affected the city bond market, just to keep the pot stirred up on the control board," said a top Dinkins aide. "Why? Maybe to distract attention from what is going on in the state."
Mr. Dinkins and Mr. Cuomo are longtime friends and political allies who supported each other in early campaigns. By all accounts, Mr. Cuomo relates more easily to the dignified Mr. Dinkins than he did to former Mayor Edward I. Koch, whose trips to Albany were often marked by combative demands for state aid.
 
Relationship Naturally Hostile
 "Koch is feisty and fighting and taking shots and calling you names all of the time," Mr. Cuomo said on Friday. "David is not like that."
But because the state essentially acts as the city's financier, the relationship between Mayor and Governor is naturally a hostile one. And with the recession drying up both fiscal and political capital, there may not be enough money in New York to insure success for both men.
"When you're dealing in a zero-sum game, which is what we're doing, it's extraordinarily difficult to allocate resources and to allocate sacrifice without injuring somebody," said Felix G. Rohatyn, the chairman of the Municipal Assistance Corporation and an adviser to both men. "And that's the exercise they're involved in."
Throughout the budget negotiations, Mr. Cuomo has not hesitated to use the city's financial problems to pressure the Legislature to approve his plan. which is now three weeks overdue. Legislative aides continued to discuss the budget this weekend.
Last week, Mr. Cuomo shot down a proposal backed by both houses of the Legislature that would give the city Board of Education and other school districts an infusion of school aid during the budget impasse. The bill might help the city avoid borrowing, but it might also relieve the pressure on the Legislature to pass a new budget.
In a series of news conferences last week, Mr. Cuomo said that the state budget delay was harming the city. "It is, as a matter of fact, dangerous, we hope not destructive," Mr. Cuomo said.
Because the state cannot forward school-aid payments or revenue-sharing grants to the city without a budget, the delay will probably force the city to borrow $1 billion later this month, costing about $20 million in interest. That would contribute to a $300 million gap in the city's current budget and a $3 billion gap next year.
 
Comments Aimed at Assembly
 The Governor's comments were aimed at the Assembly, which is controlled by Democrats based in New York City. Led by Speaker Mel Miller of Brooklyn, they have opposed Mr. Cuomo's plan to fill a budget gap of more than $6 billion through $4.5 billion in spending cuts and $1.5 billion in new taxes and other revenue measures.
Early last week, Mr. Miller suggested that the city would gladly pay the cost of borrowing money if further delay would ultimately result in a more generous state budget.
The comment outraged Mr. Cuomo, and his staff encouraged Mr. Dinkins to issue a statement, along with City Council Speaker Peter F. Vallone and City Comptroller Elizabeth Holtzman, urging the Legislature to act quickly. When the statement was released last Tuesday, the Governor argued at a press conference that it undermined Mr. Miller's position.
Mr. Miller suggested that City Hall was being manipulated. "They're between the devil and the deep blue sea and I don't think we should make them the pawn," he said.

HEADLINE: American Express's Hard Times

BYLINE: By KURT EICHENWALD

 BODY:
The American Express Company, long a dominant force in the financial services industry, faces a series of difficult challenges as new competition and more bad debts land on its corporate doorstep each day.
The problems are multifaceted, from increasing numbers of customers who fail to pay their charge-card balances, to protests by restaurateurs against the commissions they must pay on sales charged on American Express cards. 
 The company also sees a possible need to strengthen the capital base of its brokerage subsidiary, Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc., which received hundreds of millions of dollars in capital infusions just last year. In a conference call with industry analysts, the company said it was considering several ways to increase Shearson's net worth, including the issuance of common stock, some of the analysts said.
 
The Biggest Challenges
 But the biggest challenges for American Express appear to be in its bread-and-butter charge-card business, which is suffering amid increased competition from cards issued by banks and other companies, including A.T.& T. and Sears, Roebuck. In addition, there are signs that many American Express cardholders reflect a broader trend among consumers toward saving more money and spending less.
American Express's troubles were harshly evident last week, when the company said it was adding $50 million to its reserves to cover loan losses. An increasing number of customers are failing to pay off the loans they have received in conjunction with the company's charge cards.
While company executives said that the problems in the first quarter resulted from unusual circumstances, including the Persian Gulf war and the recession, the stock market reacted quickly to news of the increase in loss reserves. American Express shares tumbled $1.25 on Friday, to $28, in active trading.
Company executives said that the recent results, while disappointing, did not affect the overall health of the company. They added that they planned to make aggressive investments in the company and in new initiatives. "There is nothing that has changed in our franchise," said G. Richard Thoman, chairman and co-chief executive of the Travel Related Services division. "Now is the time to go on the offensive."
Customers' deteriorating credit, which affects virtually every type of charge card offered by the company, strikes at the heart of American Express: Travel Related Services, or T.R.S. as the division is known, has been the engine behind American Express's growth. Last week, the company reported a 25 percent decline in the division's earnings, in what analysts said was the unit's first earnings drop in 25 years.
 
'Magical Growth Enterprise'
 "For many years, T.R.S. was a magical growth enterprise," said John Keefe, an analyst with Lipper Analytical Services. "But they are reaching another stage. The market has changed. Competition is no longer based on prestige or image -- the competition is based on cost."
Analysts and company executives said that the bad debts piling up in the travel division stemmed largely from credit lines extended to owners of the company's Gold Card and Platinum Card, which are given to the company's wealthiest clients.
 
Recession Hurting the Affluent
 According to an analysis issued on Friday by Paine Webber Inc., loss rates from the lines of credit of the company's cards now exceed 7 percent of receivables, or nearly twice the loss rate of the portfolios of bank credit cards, primary competitors of the American Express cards.
For the first time, the company's claim to having a wealthier clientele than issuers of bank cards is proving to be a problem, as the recession produces more and more layoffs among well-paid white-collar workers.
"The recession is really affecting the affluent sector of the marketplace," said Ed Cooperman, also chairman and co-chief executive of the travel services division. "When our people have been picking up their phones at card-member centers, we have been hearing more than ever before, 'I just lost my job.' "
Mr. Cooperman said in an interview that he believed many of the problems were a "short-term phenomenon" stemming from the war and the recession. But some analysts said last week's announcement clearly signaled a fundamental change in the business of American Express.
The company has begun to undertake a number of intiatives in hopes of strengthening its position. Under one plan, which American Express executives said had been in the works for months, fees would be cut to merchants who agree to use a new technology, which would electronically transmit information about a charge sale to the company, eliminating the need for the paper slips that are currently sent to the company by merchants.
 
Protests Against Fees
 The plan comes as a number of restaurateurs around the country have been loudly protesting the fees they must pay to accept the American Express card. The Nilson Report, a Los Angeles credit-card newsletter, said the commission on American Express charges, also known as the discount rate, ranges from 2.5 percent to 5 percent of the amount charged, compared with 1.25 percent to 3.5 percent charged by bank cards.
At the same time, executives say they are exploring a number of joint business operations and other efforts to help expand their charge-card business. "It wouldn't surprise us to see more strategic alliances, more advertising programs and more visible investment into technology in the marketplace" during the second quarter, Mr. Thoman said.
But the tide of consumer defaults, a difficult element for the company to control, leaves analysts concerned about the future.
"If we were to see a similar credit provision taken in the second quarter," said Mr. Keefe of Lipper, "I would be very concerned not only for American Express, but for the economy in general."

HEADLINE: U.S. Giving Certain Boat Owners Exclusive Rights to Fish Off Coast

BYLINE: By PETER PASSELL

 BODY:
Without fanfare, Washington has begun to turn over to private interests the exclusive rights to the multibillion-dollar harvest of fish off the United States coast.
Since 1976 the Federal Government has controlled the right to fish up to 200 miles off the coast, and in most cases it has allowed any American with a boat to do so. Washington is now allowing eight regional councils dominated by local fishing interests to hand out exclusive rights to the catch, transferrable rights that could be worth tens of billions of dollars. 
 Many scientists, economists and industry leaders stoutly defend the change from collective ownership of fishing rights to private. The current policy, they say, has led to too many boats chasing too few fish, undermining efforts to preserve fisheries for future generations and helping transform once-plentiful seafood into a luxury.
But for all the enthusiasm over doing away with open access, there is deep division over who should financially benefit from the distribution of the rights.
While the regional councils seem determined to bestow this windfall on owners of fishing boats, other analysts say the fishing rights should be auctioned, with the proceeds going to the United States Treasury, much as Federal mineral rights are sold to the highest bidder.
"Any allocation other than to the nation would be an injustice," said Richard Cooper, an economist at Harvard University.
And crewmen of fishing boats wonder what the process holds for them. "If it is necessary to privatize the fishery in order to save it," said Peter Soileau, a boat captain in Seattle, "each licensed participant should get a share."
The policy of privatization began last year, when the Mid-Atlantic Fisheries Management Council awarded boat owners the rights to harvest two species of clams in the region's coastal waters. A far bigger test will come in the North Pacific, where plans to hand out rights to the valuable halibut and sable fish catches are likely to be approved by the North Pacific Fisheries Management Council this summer.
 
Invasion by Foreigners
 Current United States fishing policy is largely a response to catastrophic overfishing by foreigners in the 1960's, said Peter Fricke, an analyst for the National Marine Fisheries Service, a Commerce Department agency that oversees the harvest in Federal waters.
Annual catches of haddock off New England, which had long been sustained at about 50,000 tons, shot up to 150,000 tons with the arrival of the Soviet trawling fleet in the early 60's. But the glory days were over in a twinkling. By the early 1970's the fish population had plummeted and the haddock catch had fallen to 35,000 tons.
In response, Congress passed the Magnuson Fisheries Conservation and Management Act in 1976, extending an "exclusive economic zone" from the traditional three-mile coastal limit to 200 miles and creating eight regional councils to end the anarchy. Members of the councils were nominated by state governors and appointed by the Secretary of Commerce.
As intended, the act has served the interests of the American fishing industry at the expense of foreigners. But the councils have not come to grips with the problem of overfishing by Americans.
Many species in the once-rich New England fishery have never been allowed to recover from the foreign invasion. The National Fish and Wildlife Foundation, a watchdog group, estimates the shortfall at 137 million pounds of fish a year, worth $350 million. Ports like New Bedford, Mass., that service the boats and process the region's catch remain deeply depressed.
Production in other coastal regions is generally stable or rising. But as ever greater numbers of American boats have been drawn into Federal waters in response to the rising demand for fish, the pressure to allow catches beyond biologically sustainable limits has increased. According to the fish and wildlife foundation, one-third of all commercial species -- among them, swordfish, Atlantic salmon and California halibut -- are in decline. If the decline continues, already-high prices for fish will soar.
A related problem, said S. Fred Singer, an environmental scientist at the University of Virginia, is the potent incentive to overinvest in an industry that permits access to all comers. In most fisheries, a small number of boats could catch the maximum sustainable yield at a cost that represents a tiny fraction of the value of the harvest. Nonetheless, it remains profitable for new boats to enter the business, even when they are permitted to work only very short seasons.
Lee Anderson, an economist at the University of Delaware and a member of the mid-Atlantic council, noted that 140 boats participated in the harvest of the Atlantic surf clam last year. Yet to maintain the clam beds without locking out any boats or restricting any participant's catch, the council was forced to limit clamming to 144 hours a year.
Off Alaska, the halibut season usually consists of two or three frenzied, and frequently dangerous, 24-hour periods. With so brief a season, fresh halibut is rarely available.
Another consequence of limiting the catch without limiting access, said Clem Tillion, an adviser to Gov. Walter J. Hickel of Alaska, is that when forbidden fish are accidentally caught they are thrown back to a certain death. The loss in Alaskan waters is roughly one-tenth of the catch, he estimated.
 
Action by the States
 State commissions still control fishing within three miles of shore, and some have tried to close entry to new boats. But in every case, the action has come when there were already too many boats. Another tactic is to limit technology. In the Chesapeake Bay waters controlled by Maryland, for example, oyster boats must be sail-powered and the gathering must be by hand.
But Mr. Singer has argued that a far more effective way both to prevent waste and curb overfishing is to create private harvesting rights that can be sold to those who can fish most cheaply, a thesis now being tested.
The mid-Atlantic council has divided rights to the catch of surf clams and ocean quahog clams among boat owners according to past catches. Most of the clam boats will now probably be retired, with their quotas sold to the handful of boats sufficient to harvest the catch. Boat owners remaining in business will have strong incentives to prevent overfishing or polluting because damage will be reflected in the market value of their clamming rights.
Much of the fight over transferable rights is about who will get what. Mr. Soileau, the Seattle-based captain, said crew members deserved a stake. Under the current system they can expect to buy their own boats after years of savings. But once individual rights are created, they will have to buy those as well.
 
A Hurdle for Rights
 Buying rights could be a formidable hurdle, and Canada, which is two years into its own experiment with transferrable fishing quotas, offers clues to how expensive they could become.
Bruce Turris, an economist with the Canadian Department of Fisheries, said that halibut quotas were selling for three times the value of a year's catch and that they would trade for much more if it was legal to accumulate enough of them to keep individual boats operating at full capacity. If such "stacking" of quotas was permitted, he said, it would be possible to retire as many as three out of four halibut boats.
Steven Edwards and Steven Murawski, at the New England Fisheries Center in Woods Hole, Mass., said a privatized system that allowed the Georges Bank harvest to return to its maximum potential and to cut costs of fishing in half would generate $120 million in annual savings.
Mr. Edwards estimated that one-fifth of the savings would go to consumers, as the price of fish fell, and that the rest would go to owners of the fishing rights, which would be worth roughly $1 billion.
Mr. Tillion estimated that the savings from privatization of the much larger Alaskan fisheries would be $1 billion a year. If he is correct, the market value of these rights would be at least $10 billion, Mr. Cooper of Harvard said.
 
Why Not the Treasury?
 Why, Mr. Singer asked, should the benefits not go back to the Federal Treasury?
One reason is that the Magnuson Act apparently bars the Government from charging for rights that are now given away, though Congress could amend the law.
Another reason, Mr. Edwards said, is that "fishermen have been given the impression they own the resource." And boat owners have great influence over the regional councils, particularly in regions like the North Pacific where sport fishing is not a serious factor.
In any change making the fish harvest more efficient, the biggest losers would be the owners of boats no longer needed for the harvest, Mr. Tillion said.
But "the public could afford a buyout" of those owners, Mr. Edwards said, because the efficiency generated through privatization would presumably exceed the losses to those who had been fishing inefficiently.
A buyout, like an auction of rights, would require Washington to take an aggressive role, and few of the analysts found that probable.
Fisheries policy is not a pressing issue in Congress and is little understood by lawmakers. The fisheries service, which oversees the regional councils, has been stretched thin by budget cuts and has little incentive to extend its reach beyond its traditional turf.
Economists at the White House and the Office of Management and Budget understand the consequences of privatization. But they have their eyes glued on the efficiency goal, and are apparently not prepared to slow the march toward privatization in order to redirect the savings to the Treasury.

HEADLINE: SCRAMBLE FOR JOBS: GRADUATING INTO A RECESSION - A SPECIAL REPORT.;
Degrees and Stacks of Resumes Yield Few Jobs for Class of '91

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. McFADDEN

 BODY:
America's spring crop of college graduates -- a million young people who matriculated in the booming 1980's with rosy visions of abundant and lucrative career choices -- face the bleakest job market in a decade or more, especially in the New York region and the rest of the Northeast.
Caught in a recession that has stripped the nation's economy of 1.5 million jobs since last summer, the class of '91 has found far fewer corporate recruiters on campus and fierce competition for a pool of entry-level jobs that some experts say has shrunk 30 percent from last year. 
 Interviews with scores of seniors and placement counselors at 25 colleges and universities across the nation, and with government officials, corporate personnel directors and other job-market experts, show that the recession, which has generated widespread layoffs and long unemployment lines, has also eroded the market value of higher education.
"For many graduating seniors, the door to the employment office has been slammed shut -- and bolted," said Victor R. Lindquist, director of placement at Northwestern University in Evanston, Ill., and author of Lindquist-Endicott Reports, an annual study of employment trends for college graduates.
 
Lowering Expectations
 Only weeks before commencement, many traumatized seniors have been forced to abandon or postpone dreams of Fortune 500 careers and other mirages born four years ago when they were freshmen in the heyday of junk bonds and horizons as unlimited as corporate profits.
Instead, the seniors have had to scramble for interviews, widen their job searches, lower their expectations and -- if lucky -- settle for lesser jobs with smaller companies in more obscure locales. Some, finding a silver lining in hard times, are considering public service, the Peace Corps, teaching or other more accessible alternatives that are personally gratifying.
But for many, the job hunt has become a disheartening struggle of resumes, rejection and uncertainty. Some say graduate school may offer a refuge from the day of reckoning; but others, frightened into paralysis, have decided to take "interim" jobs as clerks or waiters -- or just go home and ride out the recession.
"It feels as if we're stepping off the precipice," said Andrew Abrams of Manhattan, a senior at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore. "A few years ago, people were talking about how much money they would make. Now we are just looking to be employed."
How bad is it? "The job market is so bad I've been unable to find a suitable job in North America," said Glen Lockwood, a history major at Princeton, who said that despite his fluency in French, Spanish and Indonesian Malay and his nearly perfect grades, he had received not one job offer from 42 international corporations.
H. Edward Babbush, placement director at California State University at Long Beach, said he had never seen an economic downturn with a more severe impact on graduates' job prospects.
"We've been through up-and-down cycles before, but this is the worst I've seen in 30 years," Mr. Babbush said. "Firms that were trying to hire 2,000 new employees last year may only be hiring 200."
Gale Varma, a manager of college recruiting for American Telephone and Telegraph, said the company recruits at 169 colleges and receives 100,000 letters a year from seniors seeking jobs. But this year the number of new people hired will be cut drastically.
"We are probably down 40 percent in hiring," Ms. Varma said. "Our first commitment is to existing employees."
Du Pont, the diversified chemical manufacturer, has cut its campus recruiting visits from 40 to 10, said Richard Koffenberger, the company's senior college relations supervisor.
 
A $100,000 Degree: Where's the Payoff?
 Stuart Himmelfarb, the head of Roper CollegeTrack, a market-research company in New York that focuses on college students, said a survey last October, even before the dimensions of the current recession were evident, showed that 60 percent of this year's seniors were worried about finding a job in their chosen fields.
Jennifer M. Farrell, a 22-year-old political science and history major at Rutgers University in New Brunswick, N.J., who wants a job with a government agency or large organization in Washington, said employers were telling her frankly that they were not even looking at her resume. "I just can't find anything out there," she said.
Abdul Chohan, a 20-year-old Pakistani majoring in chemical engineering at the University of Rochester, is among the few who do not anticipate trouble. "There are more job choices for chemical engineers," he said.
In the long run, no one doubts that those who have invested four years of hard study and up to $100,000 for a college degree will get good jobs eventually -- perhaps later this year if the recession eases -- and that they will be spared the grinding unemployment and poverty that often faces those with limited or no higher education.
"I'm not very worried about this crop of graduates," said Dr. Sue Berryman, director of the Institute on Education and the Economy at Columbia University's Teachers College. "I'm not trying to say there won't be angst and frustrations for them. But the economy favors this group of individuals over the long haul."
The prospect of ultimate success, however, has not eased the pain of students who have toiled for good grades, worked outside jobs and sacrificed for what now seems a chimera -- people like 22-year-old Sharon Gurfield, a journalism major at Rutgers.
"I expect to be living at home for another year at least," said Ms. Gurfield, who has an A-minus average and helped pay her tuition with freelance writing and work as a substitute teacher and public relations aide. "I expect to be poor for quite a while because nobody is hiring. I have a stack of rejection letters to match the stack of resumes."
At Queens College in New York, Jane Velez, a 23-year-old English major, has been looking for a job in writing or publishing since last September.
"I've been looking at the classifieds every day, sent out close to 100 resumes, gone to job fairs and have been on so many interviews," she said. "Do you know what I've been reduced to? Either a job in some little retail shop for six bucks an hour, or a clerk working in the Social Security office."
 
Flexibility May Be The Key to Success
 Andrea Nelson, a University of Texas senior, said her job search had left her with no pretensions or illusions. "My goal?" she said. "Anything! I will go anywhere and take anything."
That kind of flexibility in a changing job market may be an important attribute of successful young people in the next decade, said Samuel M. Ehrenhalt, Middle Atlantic regional commissioner of the Labor Department's Bureau of Labor Statistics.
"Many of the graduating seniors face disappointment and a need for readjusting their sights," he said. "The realities of the job market are changing much faster than ever before, and reacting to the new realities is going to be a prime skill for making it in the new economic environment of the 90's.
"The traditional career -- going into a field and staying with an employer -- is the wave of the past. Now the wave is going to be developing not one but several disciplines, and adapting to the new currents as the tides change -- and the tides these days are swift and changing rapidly."
Mr. Ehrenhalt said the current recession had hit harder in the New York region and the Northeast than in much of the rest of the country. But he said that despite severe job losses and layoffs, its effects were not as harsh as those in the recession of 1981-82.
But other experts, including Mr. Lindquist at Northwestern, said the impact on the job market for graduates seems greater than a decade ago. "My feelings are that this year is probably a bit tougher," he said.
Mr. Lindquist said jobs were sharply limited in virtually all large corporations, and especially in financial services, defense industries and heavy manufacturing. But he said there were still many openings in some fields, including chemical engineering, information systems, computers, health care, accountancy and teaching.
And, he said, there were hidden job opportunities in many smaller and mid-sized companies. "It's a little pocket of prosperity, where business is growing, steady and profitable," Mr. Lindquist said.
But he added: "These organizations, unlike the larger firms, do not usually recruit on campus. The students have to go out and find them."
 
No Decline Is Seen In Starting Salaries
 While jobs are hard to find, starting salaries have apparently not declined, and have even inched up somewhat. Mr. Lindquist, citing an average increase of about 4 percent, said most salaries for first jobs in nontechnical fields for liberal arts or business graduates have ranged from $12,000 to $33,000 this year, while those with specialized skills have drawn starting salaries in the $28,000 to $38,000 range.
As corporate recruiters have cut back campus visits and reduced hiring, some colleges are offering workshops and other aid to students in the hunt for jobs that experts say are out there but hidden, or at least never advertised.
Personal contacts through alumni, professional organizations and other networks are crucial in finding such jobs, placement directors say, but even lists of companies in a field are helpful as a starting point.
At some colleges, career fairs are growing -- Rutgers has 10 a year -- and computer databanks are providing likely employee-employer matchups.
"The fast-trackers will get good jobs, but the majority of students are going to have to work harder and longer to find a company that is expanding," Mr. Lindquist said. "It's not going to be with Fortune 500, but most likely with the second- or third-tier of organizations."
Ann Robertson, director of career services at Adelphi University on Long Island, said a willingness to move out of one's region was vital. "Be willing to travel and you'll have a better chance," she said.
 
Seeking Alternatives In the Public Sector
 One option in the dismal job market, many students and job counselors say, is work in the public-interest sector. More students than ever are asking about jobs in the Peace Corps and Teach for America, a program to supply teachers for schools in disadvantaged areas of the country.
"There has been a reaction to the hedonistic life style of the 80's reflected in the rise of interest in the public sector," said William H. Corwin, associate director of Princeton's Career Placement Office.
"I'm interested in having a career that has the potential for allowing me to affect social change," said Ingrid Eagly, a senior at Princeton, who plans to attend law school. "Something in the public sector will allow me to do that."
While a large segment of every senior class applies to graduate or professional schools -- 24 percent of last year's seniors did so, the United States Department of Education says -- even more applications are expected this year as seniors put off job searches.
"One reaction has been a retreat into professional education," said Acy L. Jackson, the director of career planning and dean of students at Colgate University in Hamilton, N.Y. "There has been a definite increase in the number of people here applying to graduate school, including a 30 percent rise in law school applications."
But graduate and professional school fees are high, and many students who have borrowed from the Government, banks and relatives to pay for four years of college are already too indebted to think of postgraduate studies. For them, a job is not just a luxury.
 
Alarming Thought: Repaying the Loans
 Christine Hudson, a 21-year-old senior at Southampton College of Long Island University who wants a career in journalism or communications, has worked as a secretary and lived with her parents in Wading River, L.I., through college. She owes almost $20,000 in student loans.
"In six months, the loans have to start being repaid," she said. "That's a frightening thought." So she will continue to live at home while she hunts for a job to cover the loans, her car payments and her expenses. "I will just do everything I can so I am not slapping hamburgers on Long Island," she said. "I don't want that to happen."
The prospects have disheartened some. Russell Kane, a political science major on the dean's list at Columbia, has had only one offer -- a paralegal job -- from 15 applications to banks, law firms and Federal agencies. "I've learned to live with rejection," he said.
Kenneth Friedman, with no job, doubts that the $100,000 his parents paid for his five years at the University of Rochester was worth it. "In retrospect," he said, "if you choose a good state school you can get a good education for signficantly less money."
But Denis DePierro, an English major at the State University at Buffalo who has had nothing but bad news from 220 job applications, has no doubts. "Of course it was worth it," he said of college. "You have to keep plugging away. What else can you do?"
Mr. Ehrenhalt of the Bureau of Labor Statistics agrees. "Education is still the key," he said. "For those who have gone through college, the future is still one of promise in the long run."

HEADLINE: Budget Director's Mixed Outlook

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 21

 BODY:
A big turnaround in the United States economy could come by May or June, the Bush Administration's budget director, Richard G. Darman, said today.
But he said chances for a full recovery were clouded by the Federal Reserve's monetary policy and by banks' lending policies. 
 "We're in the process of turning," Mr. Darman said on "Newsmaker Sunday," a Cable News Network program. "I think that there's about a 70 percent chance, I would say, that people will look back at May or June and say, in one of those two months, we turned."But Mr. Darman expressed limited confidence in the Fed and said a tight monetary policy and the lack of credit could derail the recovery.
"I think the real growth potential of the economy is higher than the Fed does," he said, "and I think that if the Fed continues to believe it's as low as it is, it's self-fulfilling."
Mr. Darman said the Persian Gulf war helped to stimulate the economy by restoring consumer confidence, making the cost of the war fairly insignificant. He said the war's costs to the United States should not exceed the projected $15 billion.

Paying More for Less

 BODY:
To the Editor:
I have practiced medicine in New York State for 40 years, the last 20 in a rural, economically depressed area. According to "Low Medicaid Fees Seen as Depriving the Poor of Care" (front page, April 2), New York ranks lowest of the 50 states in the ratio of Medicaid to Medicare fees to physicians, and most poor people use hospital emergency rooms for their care.
New York State policy encourages this misuse of emergency rooms. If a patient with, for example, an acute eye problem, goes to the hospital emergency room for care by someone who is not a specialist in ophthalmology, it costs Medicaid $72 in my area and as much as $110 in other parts of the state. If the patient comes to me for care, I am paid $16, up from $9 only a short while ago. 
 This thinking by the medical bureaucracy in Albany results in relatively poor care at a higher taxpayer cost.

HEADLINE: Braking the Soviet Slide

 BODY:
As the Soviet economy spirals downward and new political fissures erupt everywhere, it's easy to write off the Soviet Union and its bickering leaders as has-beens. But remarkably, allies of both Mikhail Gorbachev and his archrival, Boris Yeltsin, are trying to put together a reform coalition that offers new hope for Soviet politics and policy.
Indeed, the coalition may represent a last-ditch opportunity to reverse the Soviet slide toward disintegration and counter the threat of hard-line dictatorship. President Bush would be wise to support this hopeful development. 
 Some hard-line U.S. officials are flirting with more drastic alternatives. They want to withdraw backing from Moscow and support the rebellious republics. They keep pushing for maximum Soviet concessions in arms talks, a position that has the perverse effect of strengthening Soviet opponents of deals with the West.
American hard-liners share the apocalyptic assumptions of some radicals in Moscow and the republics that the the center cannot hold, that today's turmoil in the Soviet Union is merely a prelude to an inevitable and cataclysmic revolution. Events could prove them correct. But experienced politicians in Moscow reject that assessment. They are trying to pull reformers together and provide a viable alternative to the center-right coalition now in charge in the Kremlin.
Two struggles are being waged today in the Soviet Union. One struggle is for the soul of the country; it pits those who are prepared to take to the streets to bring about change against those who fear chaos and favor a strong leader. A less visible struggle is raging within the Communist Party over power and policy, dividing top officials in all institutions, even in the military and the K.G.B.
The center-right coalition that Mr. Gorbachev has embraced now plays on popular fears of chaos. It insists on imposing union on fractious republics and seeks to smother spontaneous efforts to establish markets. It also wants to suppress independent voices in the mass media.
As a result, many citizens who fondly remember the early, heady days of Mr. Gorbachev's glasnost find themselves in a state of despair; some believe that only by taking to the streets can they revive the old momentum for change.
Mr. Gorbachev and Mr. Yeltsin clearly need each other -- to withstand the forces of reaction within the party, the military, the K.G.B. and the military-industrial complex and, more broadly, to find a middle ground between the equally undesirable choices of revolt and repression.
There are small but significant shards of evidence that the two rivals are beginning to understand their mutual need and are heeding the wise counsel of former Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze. "True democrats," says Mr. Shevardnadze, "will cooperate with normal conservatives if they are united by a common goal -- saving the country."
Reform groups have begun roundtable discussions to form a center-left coalition. They have Mr. Yeltsin's blessing. And they include representatives of the republics, the party and other political movements, even striking miners.
Together, they could provide the intellectual and political power to move the Soviet Union beyond perestroika to functioning markets. Together, they could allow a new Soviet commonwealth to be freely formed from the bottom up instead of imposing union from the top down. Together, they could reopen glasnost and provide outlets for voicing grievances besides taking to the streets or going on strike.
Soviet reformers are well aware of the price of failure. "Nobody has the power to isolate us except ourselves," says Mr. Shevardnadze. "Self-isolation -- that is the main danger." America's interest lies in having the reform coalition gel. Mr. Bush could deliver that message -- in person, in Moscow, soon.

HEADLINE: Net Falls 79% at Champion

 BODY:
The Champion International Corporation, the large paper and wood products company, said yesterday that its first-quarter earnings plunged 79 percent, principally as a result of lower prices for pulp and falling demand for lumber and plywood.
The company, which is based in Stamford, Conn., said its earnings dropped to $15 million, or 8 cents a share, from $70 million, or 67 cents a share, in the comparable period last year. Sales for the quarter were down 9.4 percent, to $1.16 billion, from $1.28 billion in the quarter a year earlier. 
 The market for wood products has been particularly sluggish in recent months, primarily because of the impact of the nation's recession on construction of new housing. Wood products accounted for 22 percent of Champion International's sales last year, and paper products accounted for 78 percent of sales.
Several analysts said the results were higher than they had anticipated. They cited the company's announcement in February that it expected earnings to be roughly at a break-even level for the first quarter. At that time, Champion International said that price cutting had been unrelenting in certain grades of paper and that its wood products business was operating at a loss. Also, Champion International announced in February that it was cutting its quarterly dividend by 81 percent, to 5 cents from 27 cents.
On the New York Stock Exchange, Champion International's shares were down 62.5 cents, closing at $26.375.
Andrew C. Sigler, Champion Internation's chairman and chief executive, said that weak paper pricing had dealt a blow to the company's increased production. "Coming as it did on top of dismal conditions in the wood side of the business, this slide on the paper side puts our results just above the break-even level," Mr. Sigler said. "The second quarter looks tough. And beyond that, it's too soon to tell."
The company said the increases in production were the result of major improvement projects and increased productivity of its work force.

Why Older Men Keep on Working

BYLINE: By Louis Uchitelle

 BODY:
MEN in their late 50's and early 60's occupy a difficult position in the American labor market. Generous company pension plans have encouraged some to retire, while layoffs and staff cutbacks have pushed out others. For years, these inducements and pressures shrank the number of older men in the labor force, but that is no longer happening.
The change is evident in Labor Department data. Right after World War II, 90 percent of all American men between 55 and 64 years of age either held jobs or were actively job-hunting. Early retirement was shunned. But circumstances changed, and over the next four decades, the percentage of this age group in the labor force fell steadily, to just under 68 percent in 1985. And there the decline stopped. 
 "It is fairly impressive that older men are holding their own, even in this recession," said Philip Rones, an economist at the department's Bureau of Labor Statistics who studies this age group. "A year or two ago, I wasn't very sure the exodus had ended. But now I am."
Economists and executives offer a variety of explanations for the change. One is that the labor force bulged with the entry of women and the baby- boom generation, and these new workers competed with older men. They were also the targets of layoffs. Seniority made them the highest paid -- and therefore the most costly to corporations seeking to become more competitive. And they had pensions to fall back on if they were laid off.
"The least brutal way to shrink staff was to offer early-retirement incentives to people approaching retirement anyway," said Walter Maher, a Chrysler Corporation executive. But above all, older men seemed inclined to drop out. The advent of generous company pension plans, starting in the 1950's, to supplement Social Security, made leisure attainable, not only for white-collar managers but also for factory floor hands covered by plans negotiated by their unions.
"In 1950, if you were 60 years old and you were laid off, you tried just as hard to find a job as a 40-year-old," said Gary Burtless, a Brookings Institution senior fellow. "The reason was that there were not a lot of pension plans, and early retirement, largely for this reason, was socially unacceptable. Now there is no stigma to being a 55-year-old healthy man, retired and living in Tempe, Ariz."
Fifty percent of American workers today are covered by company pension plans. Studies by Mr. Burtless and others show that the maximum benefits available under these plans often begin when workers are in their late 50's. Most such workers are men. They greatly outnumber older women in the work force, and women have generally not worked enough years to be eligible for generous pensions.
Inducements for older male workers to leave are still present. Chrysler, for example, will sweeten the pension of any white-collar worker who is at least 53 years old and has 10 years of service. In figuring the pension for these early retirees, the company will add three years to that person's age and three years to his time on the job. Both steps increase monthly pensions.
Given such incentives, why should older men be more resistant to leaving the labor force than before? Two pressures to get out have disappeared: Women are no longer seeking work in such growing numbers, and the new generation entering the labor force is much smaller than the baby-boom group. In addition, the inducement to leave is fading a bit: Many company pensions are not as rich as they were a decade ago.
Prospective early retirees may also be losing confidence that even generous pension checks will be enough to pay their bills. Rising health-care costs and concerns that overall inflation will reignite make them increasingly nervous, experts say. Many retirees, in fact, work part time to help make ends meet, surveys show.
The new resistance to early retirement raises once again the question of whether older workers, men or women, are seen by corporations as being more costly than younger workers for the amount of work they do. A generation ago, few doubted their value. Now there is concern that seniority drives up an older worker's wages to the point that a younger person, earning half the salary, might be almost as productive. Japanese companies, in fact, deal with this issue by reducing the wages of most people over 55.
A more popular view among labor economists is that early retirements deprive the nation of skilled workers needed for robust economic growth. It also deprives the Government of revenue from income and payroll taxes, notes David Wise, an economist at the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard. "We are wasting a lot of people," he said.

I.B.M. Adds 11 Models To Minicomputer Line

BYLINE: By JOHN MARKOFF

 BODY:
I.B.M. "refreshed" its three-year-old midrange computer line yesterday, introducing 11 new models that perform up to 60 percent faster and cost 10 to 40 percent less than the minicomputers they replace. But at the same time, the company acknowledged that sales of its minicomputers lagged behind the rest of its hardware products in the United States in the first quarter of 1991.
The midrange line, called AS/400, was introduced in 1988 to merge I.B.M.'s System/36 and System/38 minicomputers, used by small businesses and the departments of large corporations. The International Business Machines Corporation has sold more than 100,000 of them, mostly outside the United States, the company said. 
 Yesterday, I.B.M.'s top marketing executive in the United States said the first quarter had been a "financial disaster" for the company. But he emphasized that he had not changed his expectations that the company's midrange computers would meet their double-digit growth goals for this year.
 
'We Have Our Fingers Crossed'
 "We have our fingers crossed for the rest of the year," said the executive, William O. Grabe, vice president and general manager for marketing and services for the United States. "I think we can still make up the ground we've lost before the end of the year."
He acknowledged that his job had been made more difficult because it was impossible to predict the direction of the economy in a recession and after "a war that started and ended in a single month." The main factor affecting I.B.M.'s financial health this year has been the company's delay in introducing the fastest of the new System/390 mainframe computers. These machines are not scheduled to be shipped until the second half of the year, and any delay could prove devastating, analysts have said.
The machines introduced yesterday significantly extend the reach of the company's AS/400 line on both ends. A new high-end machine, the D80, may be priced as high as $1.5 million, and a new entry-level minicomputer, the D04, will start at $15,000.
"It looks like they've met the competition," said Myron Kerstetter, a computer industry analyst at the Gartner Group, a Stamford, Conn., market research firm. "I was surprised by the aggressive pricing. The AS/400 is growing market share, particularly against Digital's VAX's."
 
Advances of New Machines
 I.B.M. executives said the computers consisted of 75 percent new hardware technology and had the second version of the company's OS/400 operating and control system, which is designed to improve connections both with other I.B.M. products and with those made by competitors.
Mr. Grabe said yesterday in an interview that the company believed that it had about 20 percent of the worldwide market for midrange computers, about the same market share held by the nation's second-largest computer maker, the Digital Equipment Corporation.
But Mr. Grabe said that I.B.M.'s double-digit growth in yearly sales of the AS/400 had not principally come at Digital's expense.
"It's not Digital who has lost," he said. "There are a lot of weak players in the industry."
Among other companies that make competing computers are Prime Computer, Data General and Unisys.
 
Variety of New Technologies
 In its product announcement yesterday, I.B.M. offered a variety of new technologies designed to keep the AS/400 competitive with the new client-server method of computing that is becoming increasingly popular in businesses. In client-server computing, much of the computer brainwork is done at desktop personal computers that send information to be stored to the larger minicomputers.
To enhance such systems, I.B.M. said it was adding fiber-optic lines to permit high-speed connections and was also offering an optical disk system capable of storing the equivalent of up to 300,000 pages, enough to stuff a two-drawer file cabinet.
Many industry analysts have speculated that the growth of the AS/ 400 product line would be limited by I.B.M.'s new RS/6000 computer work station line, introduced last April. Mr. Grabe said that the AS/400 was on a comparable technology track with the RS/6000.

HEADLINE: American Express-Japan Bank Talks

BYLINE: By KURT EICHENWALD

 BODY:
The American Express Company is in negotiations with Sumitomo Bank Ltd. to establish a joint company that would issue charge cards in Japan, people who have been briefed on the talks said yesterday.
In the plan under discussion, the jointly run company would issue only the American Express gold card, with Sumitomo acting as the underwriter for credit lines that can be attached to the charge card. 
 An American Express spokeswoman in Japan confirmed that the two companies were in negotiations, but declined to provide details. Officials at Sumitomo's offices in Tokyo could not be reached for comment yesterday.
Some people who have been briefed on the talks cautioned that the deal was not final. "This is by no means signed, sealed and delivered," one executive said.
If an agreement is reached, the deal would be the second joint-venture agreement this month that the American Express Company has developed with a foreign bank. Earlier, it agreed with Lloyds Bank of Britain to issue a jointly sponsored corporate gold card.
But unlike the agreement with Lloyds, a deal with Sumitomo would not focus on the corporate market. Rather, people who have been briefed on the plan said, the joint venture under discussion would issue gold cards for the general consumer market, instead of the corporate market.
 
Access to Japanese Market
 People who have been briefed on the talks with Sumitomo said that American Express was looking to the large Japanese bank to provide both credit quality and greater access to the elusive Japanese market. The company currently issues charge cards in Japan, but a deal with Sumitomo is considered as a move that would greatly expand American Express's influence in the market.
"Clearly, the intent is that you want to have a strong partner," one person who has been briefed on the talks said. "It is a new segment of the market for American Express. And Sumitomo brings a lot to the table in terms of their existing customer base and their credit quality."
Under the terms of the deal being discussed, Sumitomo would assume a role in Japan similar to that of Centurion Bank, which underwrites credit lines of domestic gold cards. Sumitomo would provide the lending power necessary to establish credit lines that could be attached to the gold cards.
American Express is turning to joint ventures with foreign banks at a time when the quality of the credit lines attached to some of its premier cards has been rapidly deteriorating. The deterioration of those credit lines resulted last week in American Express adding $50 million to its reserves to protect against bad loans.
American Express executives have said that the problems at the company stem largely from the recession and the Persian Gulf war, which resulted in a cutback in consumer spending. Also, the recession is causing a cutback in the white-collar work force, meaning that many carriers of the company's gold and platinum charge cards can no longer pay their bills.
The result of the current tumult is that American Express's Travel Related Services division, which oversees the card and has been the engine of the company's financial growth, experienced its first earnings loss in 25 years in the quarter just ended.
By getting into joint ventures, American Express will be able to expand its market at the same time it limits the potential exposure from such growth. In other words, if there are credit problems that develop in other markets, the problems will be shared with the partners.
But officials of the company expect that the rest of the year will be difficult for American Express, partly because of the cost of entering such joint ventures.
In statements yesterday at the company's annual meeting, James D. Robinson 3d, the chairman and chief executive of American Express, said that the company expected to see slower profit growth throughout the rest of the year, in part because of expenditures the company planned to make in new corporate strategies.

HEADLINE: Saudi Group Now Owns Over 5% of Chase Stock

BYLINE: By SARAH BARTLETT

 BODY:
A Saudi Arabian investment group holds just over 5 percent of the Chase Manhattan Corporation, according to a filing made yesterday with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The $159 million stake is the second large Saudi investment in a leading United States bank in recent months.
In February, a member of the Saudi royal family, Prince al-Waleed bin Talal, invested $590 million in a new issue of convertible preferred stock that if converted will equal about 10 percent of Citicorp's common stock. At the time of the purchase, Prince Waleed already owned 4.9 percent of the banking company's common stock. 
 The two investments differ in that Citicorp was actively seeking additional capital and offered its new equity issue on highly favorable terms. By contrast, the group investing in Chase, led by Suliman S. Olayan, acquired 6.7 million Chase shares on the open market, so the investment does not result in an infusion of new capital. The shares were bought through a subsidiary of the Olayan Group called Crescent Diversified Ltd.
 Chase's stock price fell yesterday, as did many other bank stocks, and closed down 50 cents, at $18.875.
Robert Marsh, a spokesman for the Olayan Group, said the subsidiary had owned slightly less than 5 percent of Chase for almost a year. According to the S.E.C. filing, Crescent purchased 1.2 million shares between March 1 and April 15 at prices ranging from $14.37 to $20. It was this latter, additional investment that pushed the stake to 5.023 percent, just over the 5 percent level that requires public disclosure.
Depending on the Saudi group's continuing evaluation of the banking industry, the economy and Chase's management, "it may increase or decrease its investment," said Mr. Marsh, who stressed that the Olayan Group always had a reputation for being a friendly, long-term investor.
A spokesman for Chase Manhattan, Fraser Seitel, said that Crescent, which is registered in the British Virgin Islands, had been a shareholder for many years. "They are familiar to us, friendly to us," Mr. Seitel said. "Chase is grateful they've expressed long-term interest in the bank."
Despite the size of Crescent's investment, it is not the largest holder of Chase stock. According to the bank's latest proxy statement, the Wall Street investment firm Sanford C. Bernstein & Company holds 8.4 percent of the banking company, with voting power over about half of that amount.
The Olayan Group has long shown an interest in the financial industry. Among the companies in which it owns stakes are CS First Boston, Transamerica, First Chicago and J.P. Morgan, Mr. Marsh said.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Posts Further Gains While Gold Prices Advance

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar rose further against major foreign currencies yesterday as traders expected stable United States interest rates and continued economic weakness in Europe.
Traders said the dollar dipped briefly in afternoon trading on a rumor that President Bush had a heart attack. The White House denied the report. 
 Gold prices rose, partly on news of a strike by Soviet gold miners in sympathy with Soviet coal miners. On the New York Commodity Exchange, gold bullion for current delivery settled at $357.90 a troy ounce, up $1.20 from Friday. The Republic National Bank said gold gained 70 cents an ounce to close at $357.20.
Jesse Torres, a currency trader with the First Boston Corporation, said European economies were suffering from the same problems that depressed the United States economy in late 1990 and early 1991.
Traders generally believe most of the bad news concerning the United States economy is over, and the economy has stabilized. Several other traders said the dollar had rallied on perceptions that the United States recession had bottomed out, which means interest rates are not likely to be lowered further. Higher interest rates tend to strengthen the dollar.
Also helping the dollar is the belief that central banks overseas are not intervening in a coordinated fashion to slow the dollar's rise, traders said.
The dollar also gained against the German mark throughout the day after reports that Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany lost a key election in his native state of Rhineland. That, coupled with rising problems faced by President Mikhail S. Gorbachev of the Soviet Union, strengthened the dollar, said Curtis Perkins, a currency trader at Chemical New York Capital Markets Group.
The dollar has traditionally been used as a safe investment in times of turmoil.
Against the German currency, the dollar jumped in New York to 1.7645 German marks, up from 1.7360.
Against the Japanese currency, the dollar settled in New York at 139.49 yen, up from 138.35 yen on Friday. Earlier in Tokyo, the dollar rose 0.80 yen, to a closing 138.70 yen. Later, in London, it was quoted at 139.35 yen.
In London, the British pound sank to $1.6925, from $1.7204 late Friday. In New York, it cost $1.6955 to buy one pound, compared with $1.7205 on Friday.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Friday's rates, included: 1.4700 Swiss francs, up from 1.46785; 5.9455 French francs, up from 5.8575; 1,301.25 Italian lire, up from 1,282.00, and 1.15875 Canadian dollars, up from 1.15495 late Friday.

HEADLINE: AFTER THE WAR;
The Iraqis, Living Primitively, Blame U.S. for Their Torment

BYLINE: By PAUL LEWIS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BAGHDAD, Iraq, April 22

 BODY:
Amid the cacophonous hammering of the coppersmiths in Baghdad's busy souk today, a man in a black turban named Ali was busily chopping up plump fish with an ancient hatchet.
"Only five dinars each," he sang out. "Same price as before the war."
By the standards of postwar Iraq, Ali's plump fish were a bargain. 
 The United Nations trade embargo, the allied bombing raids and an overvalued currency have combined to send prices soaring and transform the reasonably comfortable lives most Iraqis lived before the Persian Gulf crisis into lives of deprivation, struggle and fear.
The result is a widespread bitterness toward the United States and its allies for what Iraqis see as an attempt to reverse their country's material progress, with Government officials among those complaining that the people are being punished for events they had no say in.
 
A Step Back in Time
 "It's an irony that President Bush is always saying he has no quarrel with the Iraqi people, only with Saddam Hussein," said Iraq's Secretary of State for Information, Naji al-Hadithi. "It's an irony, too, that the civilized world is seeking to extinguish civilization in the developing region."
Manal al-Alusy, the head of the Iraqi Women's Federation, said: "We have no gas or electricity for cooking, so I go out into the garden and gather wood. I've returned to the way my grandmother lived."
This year, she said, food shortages meant that she sometimes took up to eight hours to prepare the family's evening meal during Ramadan, the Muslim month of prayer and daytime fasting.
What particularly angers many Iraqis, in addition to the trade embargo, is the allies' decision to bomb the country's electric generating stations and destroy its telephone system.
They argue that this campaign was intended to demoralize the population and undercut the Government, not to serve any military purpose.
 
Hospitals Are Hurt, Too
 "We saw planes coming back three and four times to wipe out country telephone exchanges that only served local needs," Mr. Hadithi said. His ministry now has just one working telephone line for local calls.
As a result, the hardships caused by the shortages of food and other items resulting from the trade embargo are being supplemented by a near total absence of communications within the country. Meanwhile, the serious lack of electricity means not only houses without lights, but also paralyzed medical equipment in hospitals and laboratories, as well as paralyzed water treatment plants and sewage stations.
Before the gulf war, Iraq imported nearly 70 percent of its food needs. Since the imposition of trade sanctions last August, Iraq has been given permission several times to make small food imports as stocks declined. And earlier this month the Security Council ended all restrictions on buying food. But the Council still has not allowed Iraq to start selling oil on the world market again to pay for the food imports it desperately needs.
As a result, the price of many necessities has shot up, sometimes by 1,000 percent or more. A kilo of flour, which used to cost 70 fils, or hundredth parts of a dinar, rose to over 7 dinars, but has now slipped back to around 4 dinars after the Government brought in a consignment. Meat that was 2 to 3 dinars before the war is now 14 dinars or more.
Similarly, sharp increases have occurred in the price of many other food items and manufactured products like light bulbs, razor blades and batteries as supplies dry up. Price increases on this scale are clearly painful in a country where the average monthly wage is only some 55 dinars and a secretary in Baghdad might take home about 110 dinars a month.
 
Wage Increases Rejected
 The Government has introduced a rationing system under which all families get part of their basic needs at the prices that prevailed before Iraq invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2. But a recent report by the World Health Organization said this allowance gave no more than the bare minimum of calories needed for survival, and Iraqis said all families were forced to supplement their rations by purchases of high-priced free-market food.
Rising prices have predictably brought pressure for higher salaries. But while the Government has granted pay raises to the military, it is holding the line against a general wage increase. On Sunday, Parliament met in closed session to discuss the country's economic problems. Afterward, its Speaker, Saadi Mehdi Saleh, warned that higher salaries would only fuel inflation.

HEADLINE: AFTER THE WAR;
Kuwait Prevents an Opposition Protest

BYLINE: By EDWARD A. GARGAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: KUWAIT CITY, April 22

 BODY:
On the day Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d visited here to evaluate Kuwait's progress toward democracy and rebuilding the country, the Government moved forcefully to halt an attempt by opposition groups to denounce the country's new Cabinet.
The groups intended to meet with foreign journalists today to declare that the Cabinet appointed on Saturday was simply a shuffling of ministers, almost all of them members of the ruling Sabah family, whom the opposition blames for the crisis leading up to he Iraqi invasion of Aug. 2. 
 This morning, about two dozen opposition figures gathered in the Goverment-owned Kuwait International Hotel to speak at a scheduled news conference. Some time during the night, however, someone had gone through the hotel, the center for most of the international press corps, removing printed announcements of the briefing, which had been posted throughout the building.
 
No Approval Granted
 As Government critics milled about, passing out copies of their statement on the new Cabinet, a hotel manager hustled into the ballroom to declare that the meeting could not be held because it had not been approved by the Information Ministry. An armed Government security guard in camouflage fatigues switched off the lights, forcing everyone into the hallways.
In the Information Ministry's office in the hotel, the daughter of Kuwait's Crown Prince, Jamail al-Sabah, was hurriedly giving directions to ministry staffers. Although she holds no formal position, her place in the royal family accords her unchallenged authority within the Government. In some cases, it has been she alone who has approved credentials for foreign journalists.
A flustered ministry official, Hissa al-Shaheen, said that her office had ordered that the opposition news conference be halted.
"Yes," she said, "the ministry has to approve it. You can't just hold a conference. If they want a specific arrangement, they have to send a letter and we then approve it."
 
Baker Sees the Emir
 The opposition news session was thwarted as Mr. Baker paid a brief visit and told the Emir of Kuwait, Sheik Jaber al-Ahmed al-Sabah, that Washington's willingness to continue to support Kuwait militarily and politically would be influenced by its commitment to human rights and democratization. Mr. Baker said afterward that he had received assurances from the Emir that the Government was working to uphold democratic principles.
Mr. Baker interrupted his Mideast peace mission to meet with the Kuwaiti leadership at the behest of President Bush. The visit was apparently prompted by mounting concern in the Administration that the flagging pace of reconstruction in Kuwait, and recent allegations of human rights abuses there, were raising politically explosive questions about just what sort of government the United States had fought to restore.
Speaking to reporters after his hourlong meeting with the Emir and the Prime Minister, Crown Prince Saad al-Abdullah al-Sabah, Mr. Baker said he told the Kuwaiti leaders that "the ability of the United States to continue to support Kuwait politically and from a security standpoint, in a manner in which we supported them against the brutal aggression of Saddam Hussein, would be enhanced if they evidenced full respect and commitment to the preservation of human rights."
Asked whether he had received any assurance from the Emir and the Crown Prince on human rights and the expansion of democracy in Kuwait, Mr. Baker replied:
"Yes, I did. The Emir and the Crown Prince and their colleagues were very forthcoming on both of those issues." He cited the Emir's recent pledge to hold elections next year and to consider voting rights for women.
 
Opposition Gathers Momentum
 Since the new Cabinet was announced Saturday, opposition groups have been meeting throughout Kuwait City to draft the statement made public today denouncing the Government and its policies. Critics say the Cabinet does not represent the Kuwaiti people, especially those who remained during the seven-month Iraqi occupation.
The Emir, who suspended an elected National Assembly in 1986, has promised elections for sometime next year, but has refused to specify when the vote will be held or who will be permitted to cast ballots. Many opposition figures, some of whom were jailed by both the Kuwaiti Government before Aug. 2, and by the Iraqis during the occupation, are incensed at what they say is an effort to preserve the prewar government structure.
"We have no democracy in Kuwait," said an angry Mohammed al-Khadiri, a leader of the Democratic Forum, a secular, liberal opposition group. "It's very clear. We are asking for democracy, the implementation of the suspended Constitution, forming a real democratic government and to have human rights -- individual rights to speak, to read, to write, to have a small conference, which is forbidden."
Mr. Khadiri, who spent a week in jail in July for human rights activities and then two weeks in Iraqi prisons in February, said the failure of the Government to permit opposition groups to speak out was an ominous sign.
 
Unrepresentative Government
 "We have the same problem as before," he said. "All we are asking for is a government that represents all political parties and respects the program of the people. This Government does not represent the program of the people."
Standing in the dimly lit hotel ballroom amid a confusion of voices after the news conference was thwarted, Sami al-Katrash, a professor of economics at Kuwait University and a member of the Islamic Constitutional Movement, held an impromptu news conference of his own to read from the oppposition statement.
The opposition, he said, demands a return to the nation's Constitution of 1962, which guarantees a free press and free elections. In addition, he said, a specific date for the election must be set and a Cabinet chosen not in the councils of the Sabah family, but as a product of representative government.
And last, Mr. Katrash said alluding to the Iraqi invasion and occupation, the opposition insists on "holding to account all officials responsible for the catastrophe and not excusing their responsibility for what happened before and during the ordeal."
 
Resentment of Those Who Left
 Among perhaps 150,000 Kuwaitis who remained here during the occupation, there is growing resentment against those who fled into exile, including the royal family and the Government.
Although it is difficult to assess the exact degree to which existing opposition groups represent popular opinion, it appears from many conversations that together they broadly express the dissatisfaction of Kuwaitis now in the country. Altogether, seven groups signed the opposition statement, ranging from fundamentalist Muslim to vaguely socialist.
Today's action by the Government was an unusually visible clampdown on its critics, given the recent weeks of relative freedom.
As the new Cabinet comes under heavy criticism, Kuwaitis and experts on the region also say its makeup may reflect another chapter in a lively feud between two branches of the ruling family -- the Jabers, to which the Emir belongs, and the Salems, to which Crown Prince Saad belongs.
 
The Salems Now Dominate
 "This family fight has resolved itself for now with the crushing victory of the Salems," Jean Gueyras, the Mideast expert of the French daily Le Monde said in a commentary today, noting that four of the five ministries allotted to members of the ruling family went to relatives of the Crown Prince.
This is a reversal of fortune. In the past, relatives of the Emir tended to dominate major portfolios.
Mr. Gueyras said in his analysis that regardless of the feuding among the Sabahs, the family continues to keep control of major decision-making, denying any real participation by members of the democracy movement.

HEADLINE: High Court Clears Way for Indian Casino

BYLINE: By NICK RAVO, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LEDYARD, Conn., April 22

 BODY:
The United States Supreme Court today, in a victory for the sovereignty of Indian tribes, cleared the way for the Mashantucket Pequot to open a gambling casino in this rural town near the Rhode Island border.
The Court, without comment, refused to hear a last appeal by state officials trying to block the casino. The 200-member tribe had contended that Connecticut was required to negotiate with it over gambling, under the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act of 1988, because state gaming laws allow casino gambling in "Las Vegas nights" for charitable purposes. 
 The Indian Gaming Regulatory Act gives federally recognized tribes the right to negotiate the operation of games of chance if that form of gambling is already permitted in the state.
Federal District Judge Peter Dorsey in Hartford and the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit upheld the Pequot contention. The tribe has been operating a high-stakes bingo hall since 1986.
 
'A Tremendous Victory'
 "This is a tremendous victory for Indian tribes throughout the United States," the Pequot tribal chairman, Richard (Skip) Hayward, said at a news conference here this afternoon. "It means that state governments must deal with us on equal terms as sovereign governments."
Mr. Hayward added, "This decision will allow us to become self-sufficient and self-determining."
The tribe's lawyer, Barry A. Margolin of Portland, Me., said the Supreme Court's refusal to hear the state's arguments was a "landmark decision."
"Congress required the states to sit down at a negotiating table with tribal governments as equal sovereigns," he said. "This case tells the states that they will lose if they try to evade that obligation."
Last winter, at the request of the Pequot, a Federal mediator approved a plan for a casino that would allow most traditional casino games, with the exception of slot machines, which are not allowed under state law.
The building, which is scheduled to open in the fall, is expected to be about half the size of the smallest casino in Atlantic City, with a capacity of about 1,000 customers.
"You won't see a lot of glitz and glitter," said Alfred J. Luciani, a lawyer and former casino executive in Atlantic City and Las Vegas who will become the chief executive officer of the casino. "This will be one with nature, a lot of New England architecture."
Attorney General Richard Blumenthal said the state would cooperate in its role as the casino's chief regulator. "We are entering a new chapter of cooperation between the state and the tribe," he said.
He also said he was pleased that an Indian tribe, a publicly owned, non profit entity, was operating the casino rather than a private enterprise. "It is crucial that it is an Indian tribe involved," he said.
He added, though, that he remained adamantly opposed to the expansion of casino gambling in Connecticut because of the potential for the proliferation of organized crime.
Numerous state legislators have argued that the Pequot should not have a monopoly on the revenue raised from the games, particularly when the state is so fiscally strapped. Connecticut also operates or allows lottery games, jai alai, dog racing and off-track betting.
Gov. Lowell P. Weicker Jr. has also stated his opposition to using the proceeds from casino gambling to help fill a $2.6 billion budget shortfall over the next 15 months.
 
$80 Million in Revenue
 Mr. Hayward estimated that the Pequot casino would garner $80 million in revenue and yield $10 million in annual profit, most of which would be used to a build a Pequot museum, a research center and additional housing for tribe members on the 1,700-acre reservation.
Mr. Luciani added that the casino would employ 1,500 to 1,900 people and would greatly enhance the economy in Ledyard, a town of about 15,000 residents, and throughout New London County, which has been hit hard by job losses at several defense-related companies.
The Pequot, in March 1989, were the first Indian tribe east of the Mississippi to secure a gambling compact with a state under the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act.

HEADLINE: Honeymoon Sours for Haiti President

BYLINE: By HOWARD W. FRENCH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti, April 18

 BODY:
When the Rev. Jean-Bertrand Aristide was elected President by an overwhelming margin in December, crowds of jubilant Haitians filled the air with cries proclaiming their country's rebirth.
But a couple of months into Father Aristide's presidency, the optimism has begun to give way to a realization that Haiti's road to economic and political revival is thickly strewn with obstacles, and many wonder whether the new Government has the ability to surmount them. 
 The President's critics generally give the politically inexperienced priest high marks for having tamed a power-hungry army and for ending a long series of street robberies.
But even many ofhis allies complain that the new Government, which has few experienced high-level officials, has shown little grasp of economic issues or matters of governing.
Proclaiming control over inflation as a top priority, the Government last month froze prices for some basic goods. When this failed to stop prices from rising, or goods from disappearing from the shelves, the official press cast blame on "the invisible hand of a few foreign powers." chants.
While the Government gropes for economic answers, popular frustration has been rising. On April 15, one person was killed and several hurt in a northern city, Cap-Haitien, in a demonstration against rising prices.
The next night, after a suspicious fire that destroyed the Marche Hyppolite, a 19th-century market that was a major commercial center here, crowds of angry Haitians coursed through the streets of Port-au-Prince.
Prime Minister Rene Preval, a former baker, called in a broadcast for calm and said "this Government will serve for five years, not one day more or one day less."
Jean-Robert Martinez, a Senator from the National Front for Democratic Change, which sponsored Father Aristide's candidacy, echoed criticism by other legislators. "Right now," he said, "we are falling into a cascade of incidents, a certain anarchy, with no sense of direction."
 
Settling Old Scores
 Friends and critics of the Government have said that instead of capitalizing on its enormous post-inauguration popular support to push through new programs, it has squandered good will by pursuing perceived demons from governments past.
In the most hotly discussed incident, the Government arrested and briefly jailed former President Ertha Pascal-Trouillot in connection with a failed coup attempt by rightists in January. The move drew chilly reactions from the United States and other donor countries whose financial help the Government actively seeks.
Many Haitians were dismayed by what they saw as a gratuitous slap at Mrs. Pascal-Trouillot.
"This country needs tourists and investors," said a dismayed human rights campaigner who has supported the Government. "Even if you have something serious against Madame Trouillot, it can wait six months. What they did was send out the exact opposite of the kind of signal the country needs to be transmitting to the world right now."
The new Government's ties with the Haitian legislature, after a brief honeymoon in which Father Aristide was granted special powers to speed through administrative changes, have also grown troubled. Senators, including several from the party that sponsored his candidacy, have complained that the Government has ignored the Senate's consultative role in important appointments.
Recently, the Government asked private business to lend it "thousands and millions of dollars," within the space of four days, in order to "create jobs and fight inflation."
When journalists asked whether businesses would not feel coerced, Commerce Minister Smarck Michel said, "This is not an ultimatum." When the deadline passed, the Government announced it had collected $5.3 million, mostly from state-controlled corporations. Many business owners grumbled privately that despite the Commerce Minister's disclaimer, they found the approach intimidating.
"Nobody is crazy enough not to give," said a merchant, who despite his resentment lent $2,000. "In Haiti it doesn't matter what the Government says. If your name is not on the list, you won't feel completely safe."
